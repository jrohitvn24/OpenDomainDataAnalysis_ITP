		<content>{CATHOLIC HALL PLAYGROUP}              
   There are several Playgroups in     
 Wymondham. These cater for children   
 from the age of 3 years until school  
 age.                                  
   In general the Playgroup aims to get
 small children used to being part of a
 group and used to being away from     
 their mothers for part of the day. On 
 an average morning there is a period  
 of free play to begin with, followed  
 by a period of more organized activity
 with the children sitting round tables
 drawing or making things from old     
 packets and cartons. Then they are    
 given milk to drink and a biscuit, and
 this is followed by a story. In the   
 summer months the children can play   
 outside on the climbing frame or in   
 the sandpit. The Playgroup is open    
 from 9.15 a.m. to 12.00 noon every    
 weekday during school term-time.      </content>
