		<title>19Farming around Barnt Green</title>
		<content> The majority of the{farmland}around   
 the villages of Barnt Green, Cofton   
 Hackett and Hopwood is intensively    
 managed grassland.                    
 The landscape is dominated by rolling 
 fields of lush grass which is then cut
 and stored to feed the{dairy herds    
 belonging to the farms.   Most of the 
 cattle are Friesians.                 
 There is some land which is used for  
 growing{crops}such as wheat, oats,    
 barley and potatoes but this is small 
 compared with the grassland.          
 Some of the area is taken up by fenced
 fields which are unsown and little    
 fertilised but is also used for       
 grazing.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
