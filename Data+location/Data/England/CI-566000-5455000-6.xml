		<title>06A Commando raid in 1943/44</title>
		<content>  {Charles Cruickshank,}in his official
 history of the{German Occupation of } 
{the Channel Islands,}writes: "The     
{HARDTACKS}were a series of small scale
 raids against the coast of France and 
 the Channel Islands to take           
 prisoners and gather intelligence".   
                                       
  {HARDTACK 28}was directed against    
 Jersey on Dec. 25/26. Ten men were    
 landed in the little cove of Petit    
 Port from an MTB (Motor Torpedo       
 Boat) and moved inland up the valley  
 to try and find and capture some      
 Germans. They failed to find any and  
 got little information from some local
 Jersey people they contacted.  During 
 the return to the cove, the leader,   
 Capt. P.A. Ayton was injured by a mine
 and died later.
