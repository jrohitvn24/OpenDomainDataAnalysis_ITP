		<title>19KILBURN AREA:DENBY POTTERY</title>
		<content>  The pottery was founded by Joseph    
 Bourne in 1809.Clay was found during  
 the construction of a road and Bourne 
 found it to be of good quality.Rather 
 than have it taken to his Belper      
 factory,he built a few huts on the    
 site at Denby.                        
   The clay is thrown and wheeled, or  
 put into a mould.Then it is jolleyed  
 (spare clay wiped off)by a lady,as a  
 man's hands are too clumsy.Then the   
 pots are dried in a warm room,being   
 turned regularly for evenness.The pots
 are then fired until they become a    
 biscuit colour.After that,they are    
 sprayed and dipped into coloured glaze
 before being fired for a second time. 
 They are then hand-painted or else    
 transfers are put on to them.They     
 are then fired again,packed and then  
 despatched.Imperfect pots are sold in 
 the popular Denby Seconds Shop.       </content>
