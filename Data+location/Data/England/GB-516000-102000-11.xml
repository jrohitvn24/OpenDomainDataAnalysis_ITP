		<title>11EMPLOYMENT INDUSTRIAL LCING</title>
		<content> In Lancing the main source of         
 Employment is the Industrial Estate.  
 On the  Industrial Estate there are   
 approximately 20 different firms.These
 include HUNTING  HIVOLT,LINK          
 MILES,SKILL CENTRE, ESCHMANNS and the 
 CUB SCOUTS PREMISES.If the industrial 
 Estate ever closed down there would be
 about 10,000 people out of work.A     
 member of our group  (TRACY CHADWICK) 
 phoned MR.M. BOND, a director of      
 Singer LINK MILES which is the largest
 factory on the estate,to make an      
 appointment for the 25th June.In the  
 actual factory there are 16 differant 
 sections which are managed by two     
 different managers.  MR.BOND took us  
 around to see the simulators being    
 made.  Link Miles has been awarded  3 
 awards in 1978,1984 and 1985 for best 
 production.  The simulators are       
 distributed all over the world.       </content>
