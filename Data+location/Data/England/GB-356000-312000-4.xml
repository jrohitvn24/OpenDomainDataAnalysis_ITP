 ROUND  AND  MADE  OF  STONE  WITH A   
 WOODEN  LID. THE {STAINED  GLASS      
{WINDOWS }ARE  OVER   THE   ALTAR .    
 THE CARVED  WOODEN {PULPIT }IS HIGH   
 UP WITH  STEPS  TO  REACH   IT. THERE 
 ARE 34 PEWS.  THERE ARE SEATS FOR THE 
 SMALL{CHOIR}OF FIVE. AT ONE TIME NO   
 LADIES WERE ALLOWED IN THE CHOIR.     
 OUTSIDE THE{CHURCH YARD}IS FULL OF    
 GRAVES. THERE ARE OVER 200.   THERE   
 IS NO ROOM FOR ANY MORE PEOPLE TO BE  
 BURIED SO THEY ARE BURIED AT THE      
 CEMETERY BY THE VILLAGE HALL.  THE    
 LAST PERSON TO BE BURIED WAS PROBABLY 
 IN 1927.  SOME OF THE GRAVES ARE SO   
 OLD YOU CANNOT READ THE INSCRIPTIONS.
