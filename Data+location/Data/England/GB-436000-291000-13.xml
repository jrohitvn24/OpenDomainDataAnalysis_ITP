		<title>13The Water Cascade</title>
		<content> On Friday November 30th 1984 Mayor    
 Stan Williams,dressed in his red      
 robes,cut a tape across the Market    
 Place and the water feature was then  
 formally switched on by its           
 designer,Peter Rarstone.              
 It was designed exclusively for       
 Nuneaton and is the first of its kind 
 in the world.                         
 The designer used reconstituted stone 
 from the Empire Stone Company and he  
 says it is a sculpture which uses two 
 materials - stone and water.It took 12
 months to construct and cost Â£30000.  
 Despite being known locally as the    
 'fountain',the water flows in ever    
 increasing cascades (rather noisely)  
 from upturned shell shaped dishes.    
 This nearly completes the work on the 
 new pedestrian town centre.
