		<title>11Seasonal Events in Pencombe</title>
		<content> The annual Road Race is usually held  
 in June and in 1985 a record 72       
 runners participated. There are two   
 races _ the Open over a distance of   
 4.7 miles and the Ladies race over 2.8
 miles. The first 1 1/4 miles in both  
 races is a gruelling climb of 275 ft  
 from Pencombe to Hegdon Hill.         
 A very different story in winter when 
 snowdrifts across the narrow roads to 
 Pencombe can quickly cut the village  
 off. In January 1982 the villagers    
 were stranded for a week. Several of  
 the menfolk together walked the three 
 miles to Bromyard for supplies for    
 themselves and neighbours. To add to  
 everyone's discomfort the electricity 
 was also cut off. The snow causes     
 great hardship to the outlying farms  
 as these can be inaccessible to       
 vehicles, delaying milk collection and
 delivery of essential farm supplies.  </content>
