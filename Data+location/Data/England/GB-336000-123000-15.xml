		<title>15Folk Customs in Curry Rivel</title>
		<content> In Curry Rivel there are a lot of     
 customs. My favourite one is          
 Ascension Day. The school has a       
 recorder group and we go up the tower 
 in the church (all 136 steps!) and    
 play the recorders while everyone else
 on the village green sings the song.  
 We celebrate an old Somerset custom in
 Curry Rivel that has died out in all  
 other areas, it is the burning of ash 
 and faggots on 5th January which was  
 thought to ensure a good crop for the 
 cider apples in the following year.   
 One of my other favourite customs is  
 Guy Fawkes night and we build big     
 bonfires and people come from Curry   
 Rivel and other villages to enjoy the 
 fireworks and campfire food.          
 Some other celebrations we celebrate  
 at home and at school are -           
 Hallowe'en, Pancake Day, Easter and of
 course Christmas.                     </content>
