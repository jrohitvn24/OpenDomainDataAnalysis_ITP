		<content>{ Frogmore}is first heard of in 1513.It
 was at the western edge of the town   
 bordering Hughenden Stream. It later  
 developed into a business centre. In  
{1870,}a green was laid and a{fountain 
 was installed. In{1843}the Art School 
 was built there. In{1942}the fountain 
 was dismantled and sold for scrap as  
 part of the war effort.Several        
 buildings of interest remain.The      
{Parker Knoll}furniture factory from   
 the last century and{Gardener's       
 furniture store.The{railway bridge,   
 which was decorated with chairs when  
 Queen Victoria visited here, on her   
 way to Hughenden Manor,the home of    
 Benjaman Disraeli,the Prime Minister. 
{ Today,}plans have been proposed to   
 turn Frogmore into a paved precinct   
 with flower beds and a replica of the 
 Victorian fountain.
