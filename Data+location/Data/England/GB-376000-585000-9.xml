		<content> The school keeps in touch with the    
 community by participating in local   
 events such as Harvest Festival at    
 Thorneyburn and by entertaining       
 friends and neighbours at school      
 events. Various members of the        
 community come into school to share   
 their skills with the children. We    
 rely on the goodwill of parents for   
 help with transport and occasionally  
 we borrow a minibus. We take children 
 on field study trips and to music and 
 drama productions when appropriate. We
 join in activities with other schools,
 particularly during the final year.   
 All children have the opportunity of  
 learning to swim at Low Cranecleugh.  
 This year we took older children on a 
 week-long visit to a field study      
 centre at Netherton where they lived  
 and worked with Kielder children. We  
 plan a similar visit to Beal.         </content>
