		<content> The present school building was       
 erected in 1964.The old building had  
 proved too small. The Infant Class had
 been taught in the Village Hall for   
 some time.                            
   The present school consists of three
 classrooms,one designed for infants   
 with its own toilet area at the east  
 side of the school, and two adjoining 
 classrooms at the west side. In       
 between there are separate boys,girls 
 and staff toilets, a staff room and an
 Activity Hall which is also used      
 as a dining area.Meals are cooked in a
 kitchen by the cook. Because of the   
 low numbers, only convenience foods   
 stored in a deep_freeze are made.     
    There is a metalled play area      
 in front of the school and a large    
 grass playing area behind.
