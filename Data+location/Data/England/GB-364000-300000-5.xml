		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF BEN</title>
		<content> My name is{Ben Tooke.}I am 10 years   
 old. This is an ordinary  day  in my  
 life. I get up about 8 o'clock, get   
 dressed and have my breakfast.        
 I let out our two{Old English         
{Sheepdogs }and watch them in the field
 next to the house.The school minibus  
 comes at 8.25. My sister and I go     
 to {Barrow School.}There are only     
 55 children. We do maths , writing    
 stories and reading. Sometimes we do  
 art or games. Sometimes we go         
 swimming,or on visits. We have        
 dinner at 12 o'clock,and then a long  
 playtime.                             
 I go home at 3.15. When I get home  I 
 play outside. I go climbing trees     
 with my friends and collecting        
 conkers.If it's wet I stay in and     
 watch television or a video.I go to   
 bed about 9 o'clock.                  
                                       </content>
