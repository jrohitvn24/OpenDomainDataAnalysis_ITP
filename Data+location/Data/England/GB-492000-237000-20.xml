		<title>20TALES OF GHOSTLY PHENOMENA</title>
		<content> Among tales of supernatural happenings
 in the area is that of the Ranglang   
 which roams the fields and spinney    
 formerly the site of Hulcote Manor's  
 gardens, which several people have    
 reported seeing recently. A phantom   
 man has been seen meandering between  
 the lime trees near Hulcote Church.   
 The Ford Lane Dog, a large black,     
 eight legged beast with two heads     
 roams Brittens Lane(formerly Ford     
 Lane) late at night. Folk living on   
 Broughton Lane tell of the mysterious 
 Broughton calf which ambles the       
 highway crying for its mother after   
 dark. People walking past the trees in
 Wavendon Lodge garden have reported   
 feeling a peculiar atmosphere and     
 seeing strange things.
