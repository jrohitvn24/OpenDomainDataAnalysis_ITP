		<content> This is the only Saxon Church of      
 cruciform design in the north of      
 England. Though much of the original  
 church has been altered or rebuilt,   
 the tower and transepts remain largely
 unaltered and date from 1020.         
 This is the Mother church of Stockton.
 A Chapel of Ease was built in Stockton
 in 1237 and the Chapelry of Stockton  
 became a separate parish in 1713.     
 Today we have 10 daughter churches in 
 the area.                             
 This is an ancient Collegiate Church. 
 From 1085 until 1536 this church was  
 served by a College of Clergy         
 consisting of a Vicar and 10 Canons.  
 This church illustrates the history of
 architecture. The tower and transepts 
 are Saxon, the nave was enlarged in   
 1190 and the chancel was rebuilt about
 1250.                                 
                                       </content>
