		<content>{The Prehistoric Salt Industry.        
 There are 11 Redhills on the Langenhoe
 and Geedon marshes.Redhills are so    
 called because they take their colour 
 from the broken red clay pots in which
 bronze-age man evaporated sea-water to
 obtain salt.                          
{Roman Sites.                          
 A Roman naval station was located on  
 both sides of the entrance to the     
 Colne Estuary guarding the approaches 
 to Colchester.Villas and substantial  
 buildings have been destroyed by      
 gravel extraction leaving a large lake
 on Moveron's marshes.                 
{The Brightlingsea Railway.}           
 A single line was constructed between 
 1850 and 1860,mainly to carry the     
 sprats which formed the main trade of 
 Brightlingsea to market.In 1953 flood 
 waters damaged the embankment and a   
 few years later the line was closed.  </content>
