		<content> Lived in Portchester for thirty one   
 years. Main problem in life is        
 financial difficulties. Lives in a    
 fairly large house with only one      
 pension to live on.                   
 One national problem is too much crime
 due to lack of discipline.  News of   
 today is all crime and there are no   
 good points.  Wherever you live you   
 could be subjected to muggings.       
 To combat this corporal punishment    
 should be brought back.  Another      
 problem is drugs, pregnant mothers are
 given too many drugs and drugs are    
 given for the slightest illness.  With
 many families having both parents at  
 work their children are left on their 
 own to get into bad habits ie         
 smoking.The nuclear threat.  We need a
 nuclear deterrent and we need to keep 
 our armed forces up to date so they   
 are strong and effective.             </content>
