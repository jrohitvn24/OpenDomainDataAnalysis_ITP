		<title>19"LIVE AID" POTT SHRIGLEY.</title>
		<content> The 1985 Live Aid Concert was the idea
 of the leader of a popular music group
 whose concern for the drought induced 
 starvation of the people of war torn  
 Etheopia was moved to action He       
 inspired many famous "Pop Groups" to  
 give charity concerts in London and   
 America these were televised world    
 wide. Millions paid to attend or sent 
 donations and Â£45,000,000.was raised  
 in one day of global altruism. A local
 man arranged the "Pott" screening on a
 giant screen set up in a hilltop field
 despite panic forcasts of vandalism   
 due to drugs and drink as had been the
 case at some concerts. The fears were 
 groundless, but many were dissuaded by
 adverse puplicity &amp; the bus company   
 refused to provide extra transport,so 
 only 6,000 folk ventured out for a    
 peaceful, pleasurable day, the police 
 on duty relaxing &amp; joining in the fun.</content>
