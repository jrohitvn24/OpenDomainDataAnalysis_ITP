 A few of the                          
 Scouts such as my brother played for  
 the Brownies and at  the end we had   
 a picnic which the Brownies had made. 
 Thw Brownie movement started many     
 years ago because younger girls felt  
 left out when the older ones went to  
 Guides. So Lady Baden-Powell started  
 Brownies for girls between the ages of
 seven and ten.                        
 Today there are Brownie packs in many 
 towns and villages and many girls are 
 members and enjoy the activities.     
 I know I do.
