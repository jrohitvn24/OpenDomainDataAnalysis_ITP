		<title>03THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Population}Of about 120 inhabitants 99
 are on the Electoral Roll.            
{Occupations}Farming (there is actually
 one Dairy Farm in the village),       
 Quarrying at Ballidon, and            
 others commute to Ashbourne and Derby 
{Shopping}is done at Ashbourne or Derby
{Schools}There are very few children in
  the village.  The Juniors attend     
 school in Brassington, and Seniors go 
 to Ashbourne or Wirksworth.           
{Doctor}The nearest is at Ashbourne.   
 The{Church}of All Saints,Bradbourne   
 with Ballidon is still the social     
 centre of the village.                
{Dwellings}The 36 buildings include a  
 Hall, a converted school and 4/5      
 holiday homes.                        
 There is little feeling of village    
 life because many people only use     
 Bradbourne as a place to live in, or  
 visit for a short period each year.   </content>
