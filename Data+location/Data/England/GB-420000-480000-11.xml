		<content>   Masham C.E. Aided Primary School was
 once two schools- the Grammar School  
 and the Free School founded in 1760 by
 the owner of Swinton,Lord of the      
 Manor,Wiliam Danby. There is an       
 inscription dating back to 1834 which 
 says that William Danby's second wife,
 Mrs Danby Harcourt partly rebuilt it  
 and enlarged it.                      
   Several gifts of land and money were
 made to provide for the instruction of
 35 poor children in the parish at the 
 Free School.The Grammar School was    
 intended for the sons of rich people  
 who could afford to pay 'head money'  
 in return for 'sound moral,religious  
 and liberal education.'               
   Today,there are 110 pupils at the   
 school with 4 full time teachers:Mr.  
 Morgan,the Headmaster, Miss Hird Dep. 
 Head,Mrs.Rutherford &amp; Mr.Hawkshaw.Mrs.
 Todd is the part time(9hrs) teacher.  </content>
