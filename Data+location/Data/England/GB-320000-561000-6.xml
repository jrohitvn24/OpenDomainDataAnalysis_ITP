		<title>06B'NESS/SOLWAY. LANDSCAPE.</title>
		<content> To the North Bowness faces &amp; edges the
 Solway. West, East &amp; South, the whole 
 estuary was once scoured by a fading  
 glacial stream. The result is mainly  
 flat plainland, formed by Ice-Age     
 deposit sand, silts and gravels. Some 
 silted hollows became peat mosses.Some
 boulder house-corner protectors in the
 village were once glacial "erratics". 
 Sand &amp; silt have contributed to good  
 modern farmland, together with        
 reclaimed peat moss. Bowness Flow was 
 drained,1845, &amp; capable of good arable
 cropping after 2 years.  Strong winds 
 contribute to use of a small, stable  
 field pattern, with characteristic    
 high, well-treed shelter hedgerows.   
 Extensive marshland either side of    
 village is composed of fine, sandy    
 loam cut by deep drainage creeks and  
 is grazed in season.
