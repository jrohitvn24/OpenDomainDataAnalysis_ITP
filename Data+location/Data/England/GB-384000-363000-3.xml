		<title>03Industry in Congleton</title>
		<content>    In{Congleton}there is a variety of 
 industry.  The textile industry was   
 the traditional industry of{Congleton 
 but as time progressed it has         
 diminished and many old mills have    
 closed. Berisfords Limited,           
 established in 1858 is the largest    
 remaining company. It manufactures a  
 wide range of products, specializing  
 in ribbons and woven labels.          
    Other industries are based at      
 factories on the town's three         
 industrial estates at Buglawton, Eaton
 Bank and Radnor Park.  They include   
 Siemens, a modern electrical and      
 electronics company which came to     
{Congleton}in 1971 and now employs     
 about 600 people here.                
    Other firms include central heating
 equipment, wholefoods and engineering.
   {Congleton}is continuing to grow as 
 an industrial town.                   </content>
