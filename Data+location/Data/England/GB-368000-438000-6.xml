		<content>   The largest school in our area is an
 independent Catholic boarding school  
 called Stonyhurst College.Boys go to  
 the College aged from 13 to 18        
 years.The College has a junior school 
 (Preparatory School) called St. Mary's
 Hall where the boys are from 8 to 13  
 years old.                            
   In the village of Hurst Green there 
 is a Catholic junior school,          
 St.Joseph's.There used to be a Church 
 of England school called St.John's,   
 but this had to close down due to lack
 of pupils.'Falling Rolls' is the major
 problem facing village schools.       
   When the children leave St.Joseph's 
 they go to St.Augustine's,a Catholic  
 secondary school in Billington.
