		<content>    From our survey we found out that  
 51% of people have two or more cars.  
 Everybody has one car, although a few 
 elderly folk not covered by our survey
 are without personal transport. The   
 isolated nature of our area increases 
 our reliance on the motor car.        
                                       
    Less than 20% of those surveyed    
 work in the local community (and a    
 half of these represent second wage-  
 earners); a further 27% work in the   
 St.Neots and Huntingdon areas; 24% go 
 to Bedford and Cambridge, and 29%     
 travel as far afield as London and    
 other more distant parts of the       
 country.                              
    Once the new Category 'C' Prison   
 opens in 1986 at the former Gaynes    
 Hall Borstal site, the area is likely 
 to attract a more local workforce.
