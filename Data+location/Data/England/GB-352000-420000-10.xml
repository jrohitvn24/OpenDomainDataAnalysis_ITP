		<content> Leyland has various types of housing. 
 The houses in the centre of Leyland   
 are mainly turn_of_the_century        
 terraced.Moss Side is part of{Central 
{Lancashire Development}and the housing
 is both council and privately owned.  
 Worden Park estate is a new estate of 
 private property.The houses are       
 detatched and semi_detatched and vary 
 in price.It is a nice quiet area with 
 health club,schools and Runshaw       
 College.However there is little       
 entertainment and quite a distance    
 from buses,telephone boxes and a post 
 box. Wade Hall and Broadfield are both
 large council estates built soon after
 the war.My house is on Kingsway,Wade  
 Hall and has 3 bedrooms,a sitting     
 room,a kitchen,a washroom and a small 
 garden.A few houses have been bought  
 from the council.
