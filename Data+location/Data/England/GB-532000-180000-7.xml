		<title>07The Whitechapel Bell Foundry</title>
		<content>                                       
  Some of the character of our square  
was lost in the ammenity count. For    
example, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry  
had to be recorded as "Metal           
Manufacturing Works" whilst it is in   
fact one of the oldest and most famous 
bell foundries in the world.           
  It can claim an uninterrupted descent
from one Robert Mot who was Master     
Founder over 400 years ago. He himself 
was one of a line of master founders   
going back to Robert Chamberlain (some 
of whose bells still survive) who was  
active in Aldgate as early as 1420.    
Thus the foundry boasts a continuous   
succession spanning more than 5        
centuries.                             
  Some of the famous bells cast are:-  
the Liberty Bell, 1752; Big Ben, 1858  
and the American Bicentennial Bell,    
1976.                                  </content>
