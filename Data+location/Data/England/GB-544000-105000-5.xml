		<content> The South Downs are formed from chalk 
 and the land in this block reflects   
 this bed rock.Very little building    
 development has taken place and the   
 countryside although farmed has plenty
 of flora and fauna.The one road that  
 leads to the top of the Downs is an   
 old cart track so animals are not     
 disturbed. Birds include robins,      
 sparrows, goldfinches, chaffinches,   
 housemartins, magpies and starlings.  
 On the hills are cowslips and orchids.
 Other plants include dogs mercury, cow
 parsley, stinging nettles,shepherds   
 purse and lots of others. Animals and 
 fish include grey squirrels, rabbits, 
 toads, hedgehogs, pike, carp and      
 trout. There are trees all over Firle 
 _ Pine, horse chestnut, oak. In Firle 
 Park there is a redwood tree.
