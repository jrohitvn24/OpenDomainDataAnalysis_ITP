		<title>08The Hairy Hands of Dartmoor</title>
		<content> One of the legends on Dartmoor is the 
 legend of the Hairy Hands.The legend  
 begins in the early 1920s on a stretch
 of road between Two Bridges and       
 Postbridge.A man was riding his       
 motorbike with his two children in the
 sidecar.When suddenly two huge hairy  
 hands took hold of the handle bars and
 drove the motorbike off the road.The  
 man was killed but his two chidren    
 survived the crash.About a month later
 on the same stretch of road a man was 
 speeding along showing off his new    
 car when the same two hands  which had
 taken control of the motorbike grabbed
 the steering wheel and ran the car off
 the road.The man suffered almost fatal
 injuries.The hairy hands have not been
 seen since a lady showed them the Holy
 Cross as they entered her caravan.
