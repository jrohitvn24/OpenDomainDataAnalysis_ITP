		<title>03THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> On Monday we went to the church and   
 the vicar told us that the church was 
 7OO years old and after they built it 
 there were little bits added on. We   
 went up into the tower. We saw where  
 the bell ringers ring the bells and we
 saw the bells. We could go right up to
 the top of the tower but some people  
 did not go up. We saw the Lady Chapel 
 and you can fit about 30 in the seats 
 and 700 in the church. When it was    
 eleven o'clock we were up in the tower
 when the clock struck the hour. We saw
 a very old chest but in french it is  
 called a banc and there are three     
 locks. Nobody could steal anything    
 because three people have got one key 
 each and one person could not open it 
 without the other people knowing.
