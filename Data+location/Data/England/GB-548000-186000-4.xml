 My dad works in London at the Midland 
 Bank.He gets to work by commuting from
 our house in Romford.He walks to      
 Romford station,which takes him about 
 15 minutes,then he catches a British  
 Rail electric train to Liverpool      
 Street main line station in east      
 London.It takes 25 minutes to get     
 there.He then gets a red bus to the   
 nearest bus stop to his bank.  This   
 takes about lO mins.  It takes about l
 hour to get to work, if the trains    
 are on time.  He does this journey    
 every weekday, joining thousands of   
 other fellow commuters who use this   
 route to get to their jobs in London. 
 About 25% of the parents of the       
 children in my class at Mawney        
 Junior school work in London.
