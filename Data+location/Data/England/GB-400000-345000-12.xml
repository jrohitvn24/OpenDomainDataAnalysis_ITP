		<title>12Industry at Froghall Wharf</title>
		<content>  Froghall Wharf on the Caldon Canal   
was used for loading limestone into the
narrowboats. The limestone was then    
taken to Stoke-on-Trent. The canal was 
built in 1779. The limestone was       
transported from  Cauldon Low to the   
lime kilns at Froghall by a tramway.   
The limestone was used for fires,      
roads and fertilizers. Lime kilns were 
built over the course of the Shirley   
Brook so the brook was culverted.      
  In 1849 the North Staffordshire      
Railway built the Churnet Valley line  
through Froghall. Limestone travelled  
down the rope tramway to sidings at    
Froghall and the canal. 80 years ago   
the line to Cauldon Low was built and  
so the stone travelled directly by     
rail. The canal wharf declined, and    
all the traffic ceased by 1950. It     
became a scrapyard.
