		<title>15CALLOW HILL VILLAGE REDDITCH</title>
		<content> It is not very often that a completely
 new village is created,especially not 
 in 1985,so {Callow Hill}village is a  
 very special venture.                 
 The builders have also seen it as an  
 opportunity to recreate an environment
 and a lifestyle which has many of the 
 traditional values of an old fashioned
 village.It is not surprising then to  
 see that they have chosen a village   
 water pump as a symbol for{Callow Hill
 Other features being included are a   
 paved square,with green,and adjacent  
 shallow lake.At the centre of the     
 village is a Victorian conservatory   
 which will serve as a meeting place   
 for the residents.The centre of the   
 village follows the line of a         
 valley,cottage and mews homes form the
 main street,with many private court-  
 yards off it.It is a brave project and
 the end result should be interesting. </content>
