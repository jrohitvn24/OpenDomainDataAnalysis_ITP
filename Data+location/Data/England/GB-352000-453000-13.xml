		<content>     Although Christ Church is the     
 only church in the area and the one to
 which most residents belong, there are
 members of other denominations here.  
 Most of the Methodists attend services
 and meetings at Dolphinholme Chapel   
 (50th anniversary-1985) but one family
 goes to Garstang. In Dolphinholme two 
 services are held every Sunday and the
 Womens Fellowship meets monthly. A    
 Weekly Fellowship, a Youth Club and a 
 Good News Club are also held there.   
 There are a few Catholics in this area
 who, while they may worship at Galgate
 or the University Chapel at Bailrigg, 
 also take part in the parish life of  
 Christ Church. The Lancaster Friends  
 still use the Quaker Burial Ground at 
 Meeting House Farm although the School
 there was closed about thirty years   
 ago and the buildings sold for private
 use in 1966.                          </content>
