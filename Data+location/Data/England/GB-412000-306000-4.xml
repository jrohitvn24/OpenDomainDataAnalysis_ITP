		<title>04MY TYPICAL MONDAY AT SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>My Monday at school begins with        
registration. After registration I have
Science in the laboratory. We do lots  
of experiments all the time which is   
great fun! Art is next. We alternate   
each term between pottery, art and     
drawing. I have art this term. It is   
fun, we have to draw the tie and the   
shirt of the person opposite putting in
all the shadows. After lunch it is     
Music and we usually use the           
keyboards. The school has about        
twenty, there are lots of different    
sounds you can make on them and they   
have three octaves. Next is French in  
the language laboratory. We use the    
earphones to listen and answer the     
tapes. We always hope the teacher is   
not listening in to us!                
 I really enjoy my Monday at school!
