		<title>09Riding and Hunting.</title>
		<content> There are a lot of people in the      
 Domesday block that ride. There are   
 lots of things to do on ponies around 
 the place.There are one-day-events and
 pony club things in Lockington. My    
 sister and I go hunting a lot and we  
 go on long rides to keep the ponies   
 fit between Saturdays when we go      
 hunting.In summer when hunting has    
 finished there are a lot of shows and 
 gymkhanas that I go to on my show     
 jumper and I have a hunter to go      
 hunting on. The hunt is called the    
 Holderness Hunt and the hounds and    
 hunt hores live in Etton.In the       
 hunting season there is a meet every  
 Saturday and Tuesday if the weather is
 suiable. About fifty people attend    
 each meet.
