		<content>    Marlow is a small town on the      
 borders of the county of              
{Buckinghamshire.}Although it is a     
 picturesque place on the banks of the 
 River Thames, it has become in the    
 last two decades a commuter town for  
 those who work in London. Access to   
 London is quite easy, because  there  
 are two motorways which lead to the   
 city centre. It is also very close to 
 London Airport.                       
   It is a great tourist attraction for
 many different types of visitor. Thus 
 our pages reflect  many of the        
 attractions of the area as well as how
 the town of{Marlow}is growing.        
 The pages have been put together by a 
 group of schools.Little Marlow First  
 School, Foxes Piece Middle School,    
 Burford Combined School and Holy      
 Trinity C.E. Middle School. The       
 children are all aged between 7 and 12</content>
