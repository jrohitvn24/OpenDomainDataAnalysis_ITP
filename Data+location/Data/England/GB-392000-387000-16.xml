		<content>{    Tie and Seek}is a game that can be
 played at school and elsewhere.The    
 idea is to get some ropes and tie one 
 person very tight.You then run off and
 hide.                                 
     The person who is 'on' has to     
 then untie themselves and go and find 
 the rest of the players. There should 
 be three or more.                     
   {Kingsley.}The rules of this game   
 are as follows...You all make a big   
 circle and have a tennis ball. The    
 ball is thrown by one of the players  
 and the player whose legs the ball    
 goes through is 'on'. This player then
 has to bounce the ball ten times and  
 can then throw the ball to hit another
 player.                               
     This player is then 'on' and the  
 game starts over again.
