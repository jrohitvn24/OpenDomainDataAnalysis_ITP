		<title>13Panfield Survey</title>
		<content>      A 15% response to the{Shalford   
{W.I.}survey gave us the following view
 of residents of{Panfield Village.     
 Of the replies received 85% of homes  
 are owner occupied. 60 households     
 account for 180 people. 9 of these are
 pensioners and 51 under 16yrs. Two    
 thirds of these homes keep pets. 91   
 people are in paid employment. 17 of  
 these work more than 15 miles from    
 home. 10 households have no car but   
 some of these have motorcycles or     
 bicycles. From about half the homes   
 nobody uses the local bus but a few   
 make occasional train journeys. All   
 but 3 households use the{village shop 
{but most visit B'tree}regularly and go
 to larger towns for special items.    
 Hobbies mentioned are very varied and 
 include many sports, gardening,       
 reading, beekeeping, wine making,     
 crafts, DIY and computing.            </content>
