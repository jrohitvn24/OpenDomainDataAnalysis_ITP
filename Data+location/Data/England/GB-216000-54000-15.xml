		<title>15LANREATH W.I.IN THE 1980s</title>
		<content> We entered the 1980s with a flourish. 
 We came first in the Cornwall         
 Federation's Baker Cup Competition    
 with our book"The Changing Farm 1900/ 
 1980".Our average membership has      
 increased to 25.1987 is our 40th year.
 Some current meetings are "W.R.V.S.in 
 an emergency","Learning to make Pot   
 Pourri", a talk on "Antique           
 Jewellery". Our youngest member makes 
 birthday posies (a custom her         
 grandmother followed for many years). 
 The W.I.has remained a strength in our
 community-the long running Art classes
 held weekly in the village hall were  
 started by the W.I.and this September 
 dressmaking classes commence.         
 Rehearsals for a short play are in    
 progress.At Easter we run the         
 refreshment marquee at Lanreath's     
 Easter Vintage Rally.Lanreath W.I.have
 entered the'Tidy Village'competition. </content>
