		<content> Our school was built in 1965 and is   
 called Roding Central Primary School. 
 Children from nine villages come to   
 the school. Originally there were     
 separate village schools. The children
 come to school by coach,double decker 
 bus,taxi,car and by walking. There are
 seven classrooms. We have a hall,     
 where we do P.E and have our lunch,we 
 have a library and a kitchen. Outside 
 there is a playground and a large     
 field. We also have a swimming pool.  
 In charge of the school is a          
 Headmistress. There are 7 teachers, 5 
 women and 2 men. We have a secretary  
 and 2 welfare ladies who help in the  
 classrooms. The children's ages range 
 from 4 to 11 years and there are      
 approximately 200 children in the     
 school. We have an active P.T.A who   
 raise money for the school by         
 organising various events.            </content>
