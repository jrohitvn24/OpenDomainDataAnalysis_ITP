 arithmetic, tables, poetry, spellings 
 reading, scripture, history,          
 geography, story writing, drawing and 
 needlework.                           
 An inspector came to examine the      
 children's work every termand every   
 three years a report was written about
 the school.                           
 The older children took  scholarship  
 exam and if they passed the girls     
 would go the High School in King's    
 Lynn and the boys would go to the     
 Grammar School.

 Winch. Before that there were no      
 bathrooms or taps in the village.
