		<title>11School Day 10.30am.-12.00pm.</title>
		<content>At 10.30 we have a break until 10.45   
and we are able to buy crisps from the 
school secretary. After play I like to 
do any writing that I have to do in my 
story  or project book. Sometimes I    
also have to do word building and      
comprehension work.In my story book I  
write stories and poems, I enjoy doing 
this. In my project book I write about 
the project we are doing as well as do 
diagrams and drawings eg. When I was   
investigating snails I wrote and       
recorded the results of tests to see   
whether snails moved better on some    
surfaces compared to others. Some      
mornings we also have movement in the  
hall and just before we finish for     
lunch our teacher reads us some poems. 
We have to go home for lunch because   
the teachers have withdrawn their      
goodwill over a pay claim.
