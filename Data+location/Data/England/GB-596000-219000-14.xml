		<content>{PARK FARM _}was originally parkland   
 belonging to Berechurch Hall. The area
 contains a network of ancient         
 trackways. A Romam Villa has been     
 partially excavated to reveal pottery 
 and jewellery of the second and third 
 centuries. It is thought that there   
 were many smallholdings of Roman army 
 veterans who settled in the Colonia.  
 The present owner of Park Farm keeps  
 Highland Cattle and the farm now      
 covers 40 acres.
