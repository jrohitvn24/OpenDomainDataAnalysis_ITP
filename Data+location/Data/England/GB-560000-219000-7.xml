		<content>   At Folly Farm the fields are        
 ploughed in Autumn and are harrowed in
 Spring to break down the large lumps  
 of soil left by the plough so the     
 field will get a fine tilth. Seeds are
 sown in September to October depending
 on the weather. In winter when there  
 is not much to do, Mr Tamlyn and his  
 workers service and repair the        
 machinery and buildings. Spraying is  
 done from March to July and special   
 attention is given to killing weeds   
 and fungi. The corn is harvested from 
 September onwards.                    
   Crop rotation is carried out every 4
 years so that the crops remain        
 healthy. No manure is added to the    
 soil, but chemical fertilisers are: 7 
 bags of nitrogen are needed per acre: 
 of sugar beet, and 3.5 bags for other 
 crops.                                
                                       </content>
