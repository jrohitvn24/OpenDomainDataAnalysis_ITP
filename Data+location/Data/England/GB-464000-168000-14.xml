		<title>14THE PARISH CHURCH-BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content> St. Marys church is on the edge of the
 village.  It has two and a half acres 
 of land including car park.  Sometimes
 it gets full and people have to park  
 in the lane that goes from Reading    
 Road to the church.                   
 There is a lych gate which can be used
 to shelter under when it is raining.  
 Most of the graveyard is grassy except
 for the gravel path to the church     
 door.  There are lots of wild flowers 
 especially daisies and cow parsley.   
 There are lots of trees.  Parts of the
 church are 400 years old.  There are  
 about 500 graves in the churchyard a  
 few being over 200 years old.         
 The War Memorial by the lych gate was 
 built after the 1914 - 18 war.  The   
 church tower is special because it is 
 the shape of a pepper pot.
