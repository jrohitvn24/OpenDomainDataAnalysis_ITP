 are many things of historic interest. 
 The churches in Hennock and Bovey

 Bovey Tracey Parish church was rebuilt
 by Sir Thomas de Tracey repentant of  
 his part in the murder of Thomas a    
 Becket in  1170. Parke Estate goes    
 back as far as 1066 when it was

 Constances by William the Conqueror.  
 Nowadays it is The Headquarters for   
 the Dartmoor National Park. Hennock
