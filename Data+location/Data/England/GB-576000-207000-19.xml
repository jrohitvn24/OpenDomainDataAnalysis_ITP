		<title>19BUILDINGS IN LITTLE BADDOW-2</title>
		<content>   There is a fine example of Victorian
 thatching still visable on the barn of
 Holybreds Farm in Little              
 Baddow.Possibly this may have been the
 work of Adolphus Enefer or Samuel     
 Purkis,local thatchers of the time.   
   Pargetting,the unique Essex plaster 
 work decoration on outside walls,can  
 be seen on several houses along       
 Holybred Lane and North Hill.         
   Other types of housing in the area  
 fall into 2 broad categories.The first
 of these include the late 19th century
 almshouses and the Victorian terraces 
 in the village itself. The second     
 category includes the more recently   
 constructed buildings, many of which  
 have incorporated the older half      
 timbered style to enhance the         
 character of their homes.
