		<title>01The Houseby Area</title>
		<content> The land that surrounds Houseby is    
 very fertile.   The land next to the  
 sea is mostly cliffs and rocks.   Down
 below is all sea.   This is a very    
 popular lobster catching place.       
 There is a loch called Lea Shun.      
 While the cattle are on this part of  
 the land they drink from the lock.    
 This cliffy area s a popular nesting  
 area for many different kinds of      
 birds.   The Croak is a very large    
 peice of sand near Houseby.   The bell
 hangs in the barn.  The barn used to  
 be a church.   When people stopped    
 using this church the bell was kept   
 and used to call people for meals.
