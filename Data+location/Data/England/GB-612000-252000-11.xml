		<title>11Coddenham Area Councils</title>
		<content> The Parish Councils of Hemingstone and
 Coddenham have 5 and 11 voluntary     
 Councillors respectively, from        
 Surveyors, Artists and Farmers to     
 Senior Citizens and Housewives; a     
 cross section of the Community. each  
 Council employs a Parish Clerk.       
 Meetings are held 4 times a year in   
 Coddenham Village Hall and 6 times in 
 Hemingstone Hut; the ruling being that
 they may not take place on licensed   
 premises. their work is to comment on 
 the appearance and impact of develop- 
 ments, local services, public rights  
 of way and traffic problems i.e. some 
 heavy traffic passes through both     
 villages over two small bridges with  
 no speed limit. Coddenham has no      
 parking areas so there are cars at the
 roadside. Coddenham Council care for  
 the local recreation ground, closed   
 churchyard and conservation area.     </content>
