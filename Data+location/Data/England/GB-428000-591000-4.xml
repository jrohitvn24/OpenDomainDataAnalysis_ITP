  Our policeman likes to come into     
 school because it is important to talk
 to people particularly children. He   
 walks around the village but not as   
 much as he would like. The day we     
 interviewed him he was involved in    
 searching for an escaped prisoner from
 Acklington prison. He will spend some 
 of his time doing paper work in the   
 police office. He will then check with
 other constables to see if all is     
 well. This afternoon he will interview
 a man about a theft.                  
  Many thefts from cars and caravans   
 are being reported.                   
  Our policeman is married with a boy  
 who is seven years old.
