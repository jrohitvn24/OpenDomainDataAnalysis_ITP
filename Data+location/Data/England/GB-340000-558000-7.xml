		<title>07WALBY HALL FARM FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> The farm is famous for it's herd of   
 prize winning pedigree Freisan        
 cattle.At present there 180 of        
 these.Although mainly a dairy         
 farm,part of the 640 acres suppports  
 2500 sheep.                           
      However the Pattinson's farm is  
 unique because every 4 years they hold
 a Farm Festival when farmers &amp; cattle 
 buyers come from all over the world to
 buy cattle from this herd and others  
 nearby.At the same time farmers       
 actually exchange cattle to strengthen
 their herds and improving the breeding
 stock.                                
    Walby hall is named after the Roman
 Wall which crossed the fields only a  
 few metres away from the farm         
 buildings themselves.A concrete track 
 runs for about 1/2 km. along the old  
 vallum.
