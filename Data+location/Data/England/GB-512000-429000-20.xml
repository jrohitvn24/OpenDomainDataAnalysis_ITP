		<title>20EAST HULL FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>{Southcoates Lane Fire Station}is one  
 of the stations in the Humberside Fire
 Brigade. It is a small station having 
 just two fire tenders, one of which is
 kept as a reserve.                    
 The tenders are diesel driven and are 
 expected to be able to get to         
 emergencies very quickly. They should 
 be able to get anywhere in their area 
 within 20 minutes, although they can  
 get to most places much faster than   
 this.                                 
 Whilst each tender is euipped for most
 emergencies with high pressure water  
 hoses, ladders, high speed cutters,   
 radiation counters etc. they can call 
 up specialist equipment that is based 
 nearby, such as foam firing tenders to
 fight oil fires.                      
 Big fires are rare and most of their  
 business is in dealing with small     
 emergencies such as chip pan fires.   </content>
