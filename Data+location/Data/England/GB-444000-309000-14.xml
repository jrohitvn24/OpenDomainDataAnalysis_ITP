		<title>14Houses in Stanton-u-Bardon</title>
		<content>  Mr.Tonge, Manager of Council         
 Properties, Hinckley and Bosworth     
 Borough Council wrote to us about the 
{Airey houses}in Stanton under Bardon. 
  He said that they were built shorty  
 after the war,as{system-built         
{dwellings}recommened by the then      
 Ministry of Housing.This type of      
 construction of a dwelling was a      
 quick,easy and a cheap way of         
 providing{good housing accommodation  
 for a lot of people, and were expected
 to last for{thirty years.             
  The properties were constructed in   
 factories and then brought to the site
 as a package for easy erection on a   
 prepared base.They are being knocked  
 down because the{concrete panels,     
 which have metal reinforcing rods in  
 the centre,have{aged}and the structure
 weak.It was{more economic to demolish 
 them and to rebuild new properties.   </content>
