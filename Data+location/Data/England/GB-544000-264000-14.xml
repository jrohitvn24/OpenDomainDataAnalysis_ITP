  The Punk patrols around the street   
  His hair all up on end               
  The spikes are pointing like a knife 
  It's all the latest trend            
                                       
  On his feet are"Air Wair" boots      
  And socks a pinkish colour           
  Then to his trousers they're not pink
  They're really much much duller      
                                       
  Then his jacket,very tight           
  It's colour bible black              
  It has transfers and pictures on     
  And studs all down the back          
                                       
  They say these punks are very dim    
  And very dangerous to                
  But really they are very nice        
  They're just like me and you
