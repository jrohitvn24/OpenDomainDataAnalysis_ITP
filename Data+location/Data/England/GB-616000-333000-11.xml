		<title>11THE ANTIQUE TRADE IN NORFOLK</title>
		<content> My name is James Nisbet.I was born in 
 Wimbledon and I attend Aldborough     
 School.My father is an antique dealer 
 and decided to move to Norfolk when I 
 was three years old.We originally     
 lived in Gresham and then Thurgarton  
 trading from home.The economic climate
 and high rise in petrol prices made   
 trading difficult so we moved to      
 market town of Aylsham.Dealing in     
 Norfolk involves travelling great     
 distances.We buy from sales,other     
 shops and the public.Car boot sales,a 
 recent craze are good hunting         
 grounds.In suburbia  people often     
 dispose of unwanted articles to the   
 dustcart but in Norfolk they take     
 their clutter to dead stock sales like
 Keys of Aylsham.Items of special      
 interest are saved from destruction by
 knowledgeable dealers.
