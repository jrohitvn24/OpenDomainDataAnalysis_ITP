		<content> In the new enclosures are large stands
 of Coniferous Commercial Timber which 
 are expected to mature in 40-50 years 
 time.                                 
  Where the Plateau Gravels have been  
 penetrated by Denudation proesses     
 there are several patches of Pastural 
 or arable farmland e.g. OTTERWOOD FARM
 (411020) and ROLLESTONE FARM (433029).
 The good mix of clays and sands has   
 produced fertile loamy soils. (see    
 Farming).                             
  The eastern perimeter of two area has
 been modified by the Urban landscape. 
  In the late 30's and the past World  
 War II years there was an expansion of
 housing in the area as the demands of 
 local industrybexpanded. Yhe main     
 protection of our local enviroment is 
 conducted by the Forestry Commission  
 who have organised Picnic and         
 Recreation places.                    </content>
