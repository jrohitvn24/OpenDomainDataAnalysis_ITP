		<title>05The Police in Milton Keynes</title>
		<content>   Theft is the most common crime in   
 Milton Keynes especially of cars and  
 handbags.Police work depends a lot on 
 public information and also computers.
 It only takes 27 seconds by computer  
 to find the owner of the car and      
 whether is is stolen or not.          
   There is going to be a new prison in
 Milton Keynes for category B prisoners
 who are not dangerous.There is a lot  
 of training involved in being a       
 policeman.You do swimming,life saving,
 cross country and self defence.       
   There are four police dogs in Milton
 Keynes. They are used to track people 
 and also break up fights.There is a   
 special department for road accidents 
 although there are not many accidents 
 in Milton Keynes because the road     
 system is good.The law about seat     
 belts is very effective.It has saved  
 many lives.                           </content>
