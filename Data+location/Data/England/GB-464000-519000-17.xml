		<title>17CHILDREN AT PLAY IN SALTBURN</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey and found out 
 how children used their spare time.   
{GAMES:}Games played include Bull Dog, 
 Mr.Crocodile, Donkey, Two Ball and    
 Kiss Catch. These are mainly played at
 school with the rules being decided by
 those joining in. Elastics is a game  
 played by at least 3 people. A long   
 piece of elastic is tied together. Two
 people stand inside both ends while   
 others take turns to jump over and on 
 the elastic placed at various heights.
 Different tricks are then performed as
 the game progresses.                  
{HOBBIES:}Most children went fishing   
 while others collected things such as 
 stamps, dolls, comics, badges and     
 posters. Outside hobbies included bird
 watching, car and train spotting.     
{SPORTS:}Football was very popular as  
 well as rounders, tennis, swimming,   
 cricket and Danish Longball.          </content>
