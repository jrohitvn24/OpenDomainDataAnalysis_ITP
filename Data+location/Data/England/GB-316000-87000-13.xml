		<title>13THE POST OFFICE.</title>
		<content> The Post Office is situated in the    
 middle of Branscombe.It looks like    
 a house from the front. The people    
 that own the Post Office now, used    
 to live in Birmingham.They get about  
 200 customers a day and their busiest 
 months are June, July and August      
 because of the holiday makers. The    
 shop they owned before they came here 
 was a Hardware shop. The Post Office  
 is about 110 or 120 years old.        
 People collect their pensions         
 and allowances from the Post Office.  
 They also  sell daily morning papers  
 and groceries. They have made it alot 
 bigger and they have a little sweet   
 display for children. Mr Poulton the  
 previous owner came from Seaton,but   
 when he owned the Post Officeit did   
 not sell groceries.
