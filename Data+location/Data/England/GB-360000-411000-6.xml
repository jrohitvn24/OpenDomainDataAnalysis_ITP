		<title>06BLACKROD VILLAGE</title>
		<content>    New housing estates have given this
 once small village a recent surge in  
 growth, boosting its population from  
 5000 in 1977 to a current total of    
 approximately 10000.                  
    Formerly a ribbon development      
 stretching along the A6 road, a       
 by-pass opened in the 1930's; this,   
 and the M61 motorway, now keep all but
 local traffic away from the village.  
    The former industries of           
 coal-mining and cotton-spinning       
 disappeared many years ago; a small   
 industrial estate with a miscellany of
 light industry has begun to develop in
 recent years. Farming is mainly       
 permanent pasture used for grazing    
 dairy cattle.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
