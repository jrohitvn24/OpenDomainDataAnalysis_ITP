		<title>18ECOLOGY IN BOW AREA</title>
		<content> Bow is a lowland area between Dartmoor
 and Exmoor, with high rainfall and    
 cold winter winds. It comprises       
 farmland with high hedgerows between  
 undulating fields, small copses and   
 marshes with streams. The fields have 
 many insects, reptiles, birds and     
 mammals: these include moths and      
 butterflies; slowworms and grass      
 snakes; swallows, skylarks, rooks and 
 kestrels; moles and rabbits. Many     
 hedges are several hundred years old. 
 They are important wild life          
 reservoirs giving cover for numerous  
 plants and animals. The copses have   
 pheasants, woodpeckers, owls and many 
 smaller birds; they are also food for 
 bats, squirrels, foxes and badgers.   
 Flags and ragged robin are            
 characteristic of marshes, &amp; amphibia 
 breed there, while fish, herons and   
 occasional mink use the streams.      </content>
