 A sub Post Office opens for 20 hours a
 week. Council house rents can be paid 
 here. Pensioners who have no transport
 can remain independent. They use the  
 travelling shops which visit the      
 village and only go out of the village
 when transport is available.          
                                       
 TRADESPEOPLE                          
 The village does not contain any      
 tradespeople but we are well served by
 those who deliver. Milk from Maidford 
 on alternate days. Baker and grocer   
 from Blakesley on Wednesday and       
 Friday. Butcher from Blakesley weekly.
 Fresh fish from Flore weekly.
