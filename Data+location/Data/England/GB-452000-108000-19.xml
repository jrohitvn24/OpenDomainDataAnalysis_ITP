		<content> Our D block has one main road, the    
 A305l, which passes through           
 Curdridge                             
 on its way to Park Gate from Botley.  
 Two secondary roads through Tapnage   
 and Biddenfield provide a good route  
 to Wickham and access to the M27 is   
 nearby.                               
    Most people in the area have cars  
 and some have two or more.  Many have 
 boats for use on the River Hamble or  
 in the Solent.  The Bus Service is    
 frequent and reliable.  The Bus stops 
 are Shedfield crossroads and Burridge 
 Stores. Buses travel to Fareham,      
 Winchester and Southampton.           
    The nearest railway stations are   
 Curdridge, Swanmore and Fareham.      
 There are trains about once an hour.
