		<content> .                                     
    The block grid reference 04720363  
 lies in the area known as the{East    
{Midlands,}approximately twenty miles  
 away from the city of{Nottingham}in a 
 North-Easterly direction.             
    The general overall view is of a   
 country area of farmland and woodland.
    It consists mainly of part of three
{agricultural estates.}The village of  
{Ossington}is included, where the main 
 body of the people live. The rest of  
 the population is sparsely spread     
 among the surrounding farms.          
    Although unemployment is a major   
 problem nationally, most of the local 
 population who wish to work, are able 
 to do so.
