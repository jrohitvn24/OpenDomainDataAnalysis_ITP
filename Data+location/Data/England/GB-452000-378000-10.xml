 The corn is sprayed to combat weeds   
 and diseases.{Fertilising}and{spraying
 continue in small doses through to    
 May. When the soil is dry enough      
 potatoes are planted, spring corn and 
 peas sown.At this time of year work is
 from 7am to dark.                     
 The most interesting time of the year 
 is the{summer}or{harvest}when you see 
 the results of the year's work.Harvest
 starts with winter barley, followed by
 oilseed rape,spring barley,oats,peas  
 and winter wheat.Now we work from 7am 
 to 10pm or even midnight if the       
 weather is right and the crops need   
 harvesting.                           
 No two days, or two years are the     
 same. The hours depend upon the       
 weather, if it rains it's little,if   
 fine it's as many hours as possible.  </content>
