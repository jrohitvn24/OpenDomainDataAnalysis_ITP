		<title>19SPREYTON PLAYING FIELDS</title>
		<content>   The playing field in Spreyton was   
 given to the village in 1972 by       
 Viscount Lambert as a memorial to his 
 son,the Honourable George             
 Lambert.Viscount Lambert used to live 
 in Spreyton and still takes an        
 interest in the area.It is owned by a 
 Trust and is used as a recreation     
 ground.It is managed by a committee of
 management representing a cross       
 section of the village.               
   In the playing field there is a     
 football pitch,a tennis court,a       
 see-saw,some swings,a slide and a     
 climbing frame.Every year the         
 committee and the village get together
 to raise funds for the playing field  
 and grants are given to them by the   
 Parish Council to maintain it.The     
 field is used for the Spreyton Spree  
 in July and with the Village Hall     
 Committee for the Annual show.        </content>
