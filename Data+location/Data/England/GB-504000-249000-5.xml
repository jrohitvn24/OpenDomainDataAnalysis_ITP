		<content> At a point where the Goldington       
{residential}part of Bedford meets the 
 similiar Putnoe area, you can see     
 Bedford{College of Education}for      
{teacher training.}Some students live  
 in the tower block rooms from the top 
 of which fine views can be seen over  
 Bedford, showing a number of green    
 patches among the houses and streets  
 and ending in distant green hills,    
 such as the one on the{Mowsbury       
{Municipal Golf Course.                
 If you walk from here westwards, you  
 pass through our lovely{Bedford Park  
 of wide grass expanse, fine variety of
 trees and many delightful shrubs. A   
{shallow pond}at this end is sometimes 
 used by school children as a place for
{nature studies.}Not far away is a     
 children's well-kept{play area}of     
 swings, slide, climbing frame and     
 other similiar amenities.             </content>
