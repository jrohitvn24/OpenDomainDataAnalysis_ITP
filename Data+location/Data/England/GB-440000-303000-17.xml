		<title>17Legends and Ghosts.</title>
		<content>  There are many old legends and ghost 
 stories associated with the area - a  
 headless Roman legionary has been     
 seen. He is descibed as having bare   
 legs and a helmet and has been spotted
 galloping close to the battlefield.   
     The most well known story is that 
 of the Grey Lady of Bosworth Hall. The
 story concerns the owners' daughter,  
 Jane, who was courting the gardeners  
 son, to the disapproval of her father.
 To prevent this clandestine           
 relationship, the father set a mantrap
 which tragically Jane fell into - she 
 was badly wounded and infirm until her
 death, and her ghost is said th haunt 
 her old room which is now part of     
 Bosworth Infirmary, an old peoples    
 hospital. Many people claim to have   
 seen her, and there is said to be a   
 blood stain on the ceiling near to the
 fireplace. This is Janes blood.       </content>
