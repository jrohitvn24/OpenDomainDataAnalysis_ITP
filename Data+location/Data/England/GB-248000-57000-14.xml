		<content> Many firms move to Estover to make use
 of the good transport network and the 
 possibility of expanding their firms. 
 The Estover Industrial Estate is found
 in the eastern part of Plymouth.It is 
 well away from the built up city      
 centre,but goods can easily be        
 transported from Plymouth's airport   
 and the main roadway,the A38.This road
 goes to Exeter where it joins the M5, 
 making it easy to get to Bristol,     
 London and Birmingham.The factories on
 the Industrial Estate can take their  
 goods to the nearby airport from where
 they are delivered,quickly,to the     
 major cities of Britain.              
 Transport by rail is also possible as 
 the station is easy to get to from    
 this area of Plymouth.The main line   
 runs to London and the North.
