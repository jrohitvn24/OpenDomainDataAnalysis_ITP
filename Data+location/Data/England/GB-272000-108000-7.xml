 of them.The other four were to far    
 away from us to contact.Twelve of the 
 eighteen farms are {dairy farms}making
 their money out of milk,one is a mixed
 farm and the other five are{beef      
{farms.}The farms vary in size from 40 
 to 186 acres,and the {average size}is 
 118 acres.The average number in the   
 milking herd is sixty cows and they   
 are nearly all{Friesians.}The milk    
 mostly goes to North Tawton collected 
 by a{tanker}each day.Nearly all the   
 farms are all in{grass},with about one
 fifth {cereals} for winter            
 feed.Between three and four{tractors} 
 are kept on every farm and
