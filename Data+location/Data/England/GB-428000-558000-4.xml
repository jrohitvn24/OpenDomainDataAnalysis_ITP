		<content>{ }The {Stephenson Estate}was built on 
 wasteland by the{Development          
{Corporation}to improve industry.  It  
 consists of several factories and     
 warehouses.  We conducted a survey of 
 two factories and a warehouse:        
{Bainbridge Silencers}is a factory     
 which distributes car exhaust systems.
 It provides employment for 13 people, 
 mostly truck delivery men.  The reason
 for the small staff is the use of     
{computers}which enable fast ordering  
 by companies who pay by account.      
 The{Philips}factory makes a deflection
 unit for coloured televisions.  It is 
 one of several factories throughout   
 England,but the parent company is     
 Dutch.  The factory employs 598       
 workers who work shifts.  The {Nike}  
 sportsware warehouse and distribution 
 centre is the only one in England     
 although there are factories abroad.  </content>
