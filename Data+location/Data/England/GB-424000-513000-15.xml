		<title>15BAYDALE FARM IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> There have been three principal houses
 called Baydale Farm, the first was in 
 Blackwell, but that was demolished in 
 1900, the second, on the hill, is now 
 privately owned and the third in its  
 present position down by the River    
 Tees.The farm has belonged to         
 generations of the Brown family since 
 about 1800.On the 163 acres of fertile
 soil that he owns, including Baydale  
 Wood, he grows wheat, barley, potatoes
 and grass. The land has always had the
 same use and can be partly flooded at 
 times.  In 1965 three quarters of the 
 land was flooded when a dam further up
 the River Tees was opened.  Mr.Brown  
 owns 80 cows, 2 cockerels,several hens
 and a goat.  Fifteen of the cows are  
 for breeding and the rest are for     
 butchering.                           
 Mr. Brown has a caravan and he has a  
 holiday in his least busy week.       </content>
