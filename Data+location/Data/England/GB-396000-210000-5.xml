		<title>05Transport in Elkstone.</title>
		<content> The Elkstone area is a prosperous part
 of Gloucester and this wealth is      
 reflected in the very high level of   
 car ownership. 98.21% of the area's   
 households have a car and this is the 
 second highest figure in the county.  
 However, if a household has 1 car used
 by 1 member, the others will be cut   
 off in such a rural area, where the   
 nearest bus stop was over a mile away.
 To overcome this isolation            
 Gloucestershire County Council        
 operates a minibus service to         
 Cheltenham, providing for a 3 and a   
 half hour stay. However, the bus only 
 operates on the first and the third   
 Tuesdays of each month, so villagers  
 cannot afford to forget anything      
 vital!                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
