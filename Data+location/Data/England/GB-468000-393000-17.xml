		<title>17POINTS OF VIEW IN MISSON</title>
		<content> Most people in Misson are quite happy 
 living here but a few would like      
 certain changes.We went around        
 interviewing the local people about   
 living here and asking them if they   
 would like any changes. Some would    
 like a better bus service,somewhere   
 for the children play,more things     
 going on,a docter in the village,a    
 supermarket,a few people commented    
 about the roads which need mending in 
 parts, and the older people don't like
 the stiles along the river bank and it
 stops them walking,1 or 2 people      
 living near the factory which         
 dries crops                           
 (Misson Feeds And Storage)complain    
 about the dust and dirt which blew    
 around the farm,it and a few people   
 saud that the village was too         
 isolated.                             
                                       </content>
