		<content> FRENCH TIGGY is a game played by 5 or 
 more players.They all stand in a line 
 &amp; chant the verse"French tiggy,french 
 tiggy 1 2 3,if you show your teeth or 
 smile you're man 1 2 3."In turn they  
 make a humming noise &amp; cover their    
 teeth with their lips.The person who  
 makes their teeth visible is "man".   
 This person tries to tig someone else.
 If someone is caught they must hold   
 hands &amp; together catch the rest.If 4  
 people are caught then they split in  
 to 2 groups.When everybody is caught  
 then the game is repeated .In BRITISH 
 BULLDOG you have a person standing in 
 the middle.He picks a person &amp; tries  
 to catch them.If he gets across them  
 the rest run as well.If he doesn't    
 then he helps to catch the others.The 
 last one across is the winner.Other   
 games include Tiggy Scarecrow &amp; Kings
