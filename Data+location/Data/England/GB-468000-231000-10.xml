		<content>{  St Rumwold}was born in 630  and  his
 grandfather was {Penda,} last  of  the
 heathen warrior king of Mercia. Legend
 says that at the age of{three days,}he
 sat up  and {asked }to be Baptized and
 buried  in  Buckingham.  This  is most
 unlikely because people took ages from
 when they was  first  christened,  not
 from when he was born. He was probably
 a{young man}when  this happened and he
 died three days later.                
   His wishes were carried out  because
 he was  considered  a  saint.  Several
{churches, wells}and{springs}have  been
 dedicated}to him.                     
   Pilgrims used to flock to Buckingham
 to  drink  at his well and pray at his
 shrine. In old{Buckingham, }there is a
 Street  named  after  him, where he is
 supposed to have spoken his wishes.
