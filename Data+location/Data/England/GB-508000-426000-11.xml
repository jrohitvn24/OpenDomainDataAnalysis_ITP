		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOANNE</title>
		<content> I get up at about 8.00, this is not   
 very early but I only live 7 doors    
 away from school.  My sister Nicky    
 always seems to get to the bathroom   
 before me and she takes ages to get   
 washed.  Eventually I get washed and  
 have my breakfast.  At about 8.50 I go
 back upstairs and put some makeup on, 
 brush my teeth and set of for school  
 at about 8.58.  At school we have     
 registration and then start lessons   
 such as Art, Theology, Maths and PE.  
 PE is my favorite lesson as I enjoy   
 sport.  During the breaks my sisters  
 (I am a triplet) and I run the House  
 block tuckshop. At 3.40 I go home and 
 Dad makes our tea then at about 6.30  
 my sisters (Nicky and Elaine)and I go 
 to training at Hull Spartans Athletic 
 Club until about 8.30.  We go home    
 tired from training watch TV have a   
 bath and go to bed at about 11.oo.    </content>
