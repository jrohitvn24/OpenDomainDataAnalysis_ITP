		<title>11ST.MARY'S BUTTERFLY CENTRE</title>
		<content>{LONGSTONE BUTTERFLY CENTRE}     Up at 
 Longstone,in a converted flower farm  
 building,is the Butterfly Centre.This 
 consists of a restaurant,a museum,a   
 putting green and a butterfly area.At 
 one time there are about 100          
 butterflies and 15 different types.In 
 the summer the ideal temperature is   
 78',and in the winter the heaters are 
 turned off to make it like winter for 
 the butterflies.The butterflies are   
 brought in from all over the world,and
 after being in a cacoon for two weeks 
 they are free to flit around the place
 .The rarest butterfly up there is the 
 English Swallowtail.It was Mr.Mumfords
 idea,and from that idea it took 18    
 months to complete.The machinery comes
 from all over Scilly.The oldest one,  
 the sea drill,is on display with a few
 others.15 people are employed to run  
 the centre.                           </content>
