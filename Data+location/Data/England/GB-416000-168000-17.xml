		<title>17THE MAYOR SPEAKS (2)</title>
		<content> The hippies were friendly, and I felt 
 they could have started a circus from 
 the jugglers and musicians who were   
 performing that glorious afternoon. My
 incognito was shattered when the Earl 
 of Cardigan, who had given them       
 permission to stay in the forest      
 temporarily, arrived, followed by     
 large numbers of journalists who      
 wanted 'a statement'. The departure of
 the hippies was something which       
 pleased the people of Marlborough,    
 although I thought they had handled it
 well.                                 
                                       
 Doubtless we shall talk of this for   
 years to come!
