		<title>03The Unemployed, Corby.</title>
		<content>With the closure of the Steelworks 35% 
of Corby's workforce was made          
redundant. In 1985 the unemployment    
rate is still 22% against the national 
average of 13.5%, despite new          
industries coming to the town. The 50+ 
age group have been unable to find work
and face long term unemployment. Youth 
employment, however, is excellent as   
the newer factories are able to pay low
wages which the young will accept.     
Corby has a Jobcentre giving           
information on work available and the  
town provides an excellent Youth       
Training Scheme for 16 to 18 year olds.
There are several unemployed activities
centres in the town and concessionary  
rates are given to the unemployed in   
all sporting facilities  and at        
cultural events.
