		<title>15A DAY CARE GROUP 1</title>
		<content>  Mrs.S.Mitchell runs a private day    
 care group at her home on Larkhill.   
  She looks after young children while 
 their parents are at work,taking them 
 for walks or finding things for them  
 to do in or around the house.The      
 childrens parents drop off their child
 in the morning and either pick them up
 at lunch time,if they have a part time
 job or after they finish work in the  
 evening.                              
  Mrs.Mitchell orders books and games  
 from a wholesale supplier and so gets 
 them cheap.The childrens parents pay  
 part of the money towards buying the  
 equipment Mrs.Mitchell needs to run   
 her play group successfully.
