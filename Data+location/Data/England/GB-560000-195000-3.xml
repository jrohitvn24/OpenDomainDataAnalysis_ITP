		<title>03The Video Shop,Hutton</title>
		<content> In Woodlands Avenue there is a row of 
 shops next to Arnolds Avenue.One of   
 the shops was a bakers and a wool     
 shop.After these shops closed down a  
 video shop called{"Video Ville"       
 opened.In the first two weeks it was  
 broken into.The two burglars got away 
 with some tapes and a video recorder. 
 They broke into the video shop by     
 backing a lorry into the front doors. 
 About four weeks later it was broken  
 into again.This time by the back      
 entrance.If they had broken into it by
 the front entrance an alarm would have
 gone off.This time the burglar got    
 away with nothing.Soon after the      
 second break_in the shop closed down. 
 After it closed down it was decided to
 turn it into a take away.When they    
 applied for planning permission it was
 refused because of possible nuisance  
 to residents.                         </content>
