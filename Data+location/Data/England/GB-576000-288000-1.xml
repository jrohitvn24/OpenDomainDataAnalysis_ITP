		<content> The block is just in Norfolk and con- 
 sists of the village of Weeting amidst
 mixed farmland and evolved from a feu-
 dal system based at Weeting Hall.Since
 its disappearance with its important  
 families, the growth has been mostly  
 in bungalows to the north and south of
 the village green and many of them are
 inhabited by retired people from out- 
 side E.Anglia and Americans stationed 
 at nearby Airbases. This tends to lead
 to a frequent turnover in the popula- 
 tion but there are still many natives 
 who can recall Weeting back to the    
 turn of the century.Sometimes the     
 Americans are accused of neglecting   
 their properties to the detriment of  
 the village.There is mains water,elec-
 tricity and sewerage but no gas.
