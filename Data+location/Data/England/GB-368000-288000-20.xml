    At the{Down School,}fourth year    
 children are getting ready to go to   
 their Secondary School at the{Endowed}
{Comprehensive School}in Bridgnorth,   
 which was once the Grammar school.    
                                       
    Everyone there has a tie for       
 Rowley, Hardwick or Washbrook Houses. 
 Some time ago, Mr. James, Head of     
 Lower School came to visit us, and    
 then a few weeks later the fourth year
 visited the Endowed School for the    
 day to see what it was like. Our      
 parents went last week to see the     
 school, and to find out our tutorial  
 groups, and to ask questions.         
                                       
    We feel excited, but a bit nervous 
 and uncertain.
