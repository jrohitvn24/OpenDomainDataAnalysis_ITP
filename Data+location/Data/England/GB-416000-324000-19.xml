		<title>19HEAVY TRAFFIC ON RURAL ROADS</title>
		<content> There are no major or 'A' roads       
 running through the area.  The B5017  
 and the B5324 join at the New Inn     
 junction.                             
                                       
 It is increasingly common for heavy   
 vehicles to use minor roads as short  
 cuts to classified roads.  This often 
 causes erosion of grass verges and    
 destruction of road surfaces on narrow
 lanes not made to carry heavy traffic.
 It also causes danger to cyclists,    
 horse-riders and pedestrians as there 
 are almost no footpaths.              
                                       
 Some heavy traffic is necessary to    
 service farms, public houses and the  
 garage, but to preserve rural roads it
 is desirable to introduce legislation 
 prohibiting their use by heavy        
 vehicles except for access.
