		<title>17Tourism - Two Bridges</title>
		<content> This area is within the Dartmoor      
 National Park, and every year the     
 demands from the tourist industry     
 increase.                             
                                       
 The area mainly attracts ramblers and 
 hikers, as well as day trippers who   
 generally congregate around Two       
 Bridges. The National Park Committee  
 actively encourage the use of the moor
 for walking by providing guided walks 
 for a modest fee, some of which are   
 general walks, and others which are   
 concerned with special subjects such  
 as map reading or ornithology. Walkers
 can wander freely over the open moor, 
 as a de facto right of access has     
 existed for many years.               
                                       
 Ponies can be hired at various places,
 although tend not to be seen on the   
 high moor.                            </content>
