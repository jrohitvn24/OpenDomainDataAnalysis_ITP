		<content>   Our "D" Block begins(south-west     
 corner) approximately half a mile from
 the centre of Norwich.It includes     
 interesting geographical features,such
 as Mousehold Heath,Norwich Prison,and 
 large residential areas of both       
 privately-owned and council-owned     
 houses. To the north and east of the  
 region there are large plantations of 
 both deciduous and evergreen trees    
 .These are privately owned.One has    
 been recently leased to Broadland D.C 
 to join the ever-increasing leisure   
 activities available in the area.     
  Approximately 31000 people live in   
 the 'D'Block.There are 11 Primary(or  
 Middle)schools and 2 Secondary        
 schools.At the southern edge of       
 Mousehold Heath you find both Norwich 
 Prison and the Britannia Barracks ,   
 formerly home to the East Anglian     
 Regiment and now a military museum.   </content>
