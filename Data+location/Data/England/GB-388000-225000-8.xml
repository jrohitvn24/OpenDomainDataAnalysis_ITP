		<content>                                       
 The Canal was built in the 1830's. It 
 was first used to transport coal to   
 Cheltenham.It was eventually  closed  
 down as trains were used instead of   
 the barges,towards the end of the 19  
 century.The Canal continued to decline
 and was drained in the 1950's because 
 it flooded.It became very overgrown , 
 a haven for wildlife.Schools visited  
 it regularly.                         
            In 1952 Mr.Alan Pitkin     
 moved to the area + tried to organise 
 the restoration of the Canal.He       
 planned to run pleasure and           
 educational trips.A Trust was set up  
 to pay for the work.However,the plan  
 failed and in June 1985 the Canal was 
 bought by the Gloucester              
 Conservationists Society.
