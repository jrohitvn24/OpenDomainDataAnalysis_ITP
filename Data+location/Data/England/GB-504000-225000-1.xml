		<content>{INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORT: }             
 The area covered has very little      
 industrial development apart from the 
 industrial estates in the south west  
 section. It is however well served by 
 transport links with both the M1 and  
 the new electrified railway.          
{HOUSING:}A wide variety of housing can
 be found within the area, ranging from
 the villages of Upper and Lower Sundon
 to the modern estates of Luton where a
 new estate is currently under         
 construction.                         
{RECREATION AND LEISURE:}The area has  
 two sports centres,a large number of  
 public playing fields and open spaces 
 as well as a variety of social clubs  
 and pubs.                             
{FARMING AND LANDSCAPE:}At least a     
 third of the area is used for farming 
 with the major crops being cereals.
