		<content>   The children have been educated in  
 various parts of the town since 1719  
 when Lady Capel opened a school for   
 the education of servant girls. A     
 Board School was opened in 1872 and a 
 Church of England school in 1876. This
 year a new First School was opened on 
 3rd April at a cost of three quarters 
 of a million pounds. It has a well    
 equipped Nursery School attached to   
 it. Local people are very proud of    
 their bright, well planned school.    
   Sharing the same site is South      
 Tynedale Middle School which was built
 in 1961 as a Secondary Modern school, 
 but became a Middle school in 1974,   
 catering for the 9 to 13 year olds in 
 the district around Haltwhistle. The  
 schools are on an elevated site, with 
 views across to the fells, surrounded 
 by well kept playing fields and with  
 the local swimming pool near at hand. </content>
