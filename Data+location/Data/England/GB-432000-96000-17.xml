		<title>17HOUSES/GARDENS OF SE BOLDRE</title>
		<content> There are no Stately Homes here and 2 
 of the largest houses are now schools.
 Of the rest most date from the 19th C.
 and later.However there are several   
 lovely old cottages and farmhouses    
 lovingly restored and delightful to   
 see.The Fleur de Lys pub is extremely 
 old and has a list of landlords going 
 back to the 13th C.There are modern   
 Council homes and many no-nonsense    
 small dwellings.Nearly all,large or   
 small are greatly enhanced by their   
 gardens.Gardening is a popular hobby  
 in Boldre and the area as the annual  
 Produce Show testifies.Fruit,flowers  
 and vegetables thrive in the soil and 
 blossom into beauty with the hard work
 and dedication they receive.The first 
 school meals service was started at   
 the William Gilpin School and for a   
 while they grew their own vegetables. 
 Our gardens are practical&amp; pleasurable</content>
