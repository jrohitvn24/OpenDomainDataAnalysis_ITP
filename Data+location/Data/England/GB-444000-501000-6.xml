		<title>06Population, Swainby &amp; Potto</title>
		<content>{Census}figures for Swainby and Potto  
 in 1981 were 546 and 222, and have    
 varied little since.{Swainby}populat- 
 ion centres on the High Street with 64
 houses averaging 2.3 people; an estate
 of 18 houses averages 2.0 and the OAP 
 bungalows 1.4. Restriction of housing 
 development has maintained an accept- 
 able balance between established resi-
 dents and newcomers. In the block 36  
 families have children of school age  
 or under but the number at the primary
 school, 78 in 1981 and 51 in 1983, is 
 now only 37. Higher than average house
 prices mean that young couples usually
 start married life in larger villages 
 nearer their places of work, and there
 is a high proportion of senior        
 citizens.{Potto}has 27 families with  
 children under 18 and 24 pensioners.  
 There were 6 births, 8 marriages and 9
 deaths in 1984 in the two villages.   </content>
