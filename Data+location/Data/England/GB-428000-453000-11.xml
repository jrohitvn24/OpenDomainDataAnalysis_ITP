		<title>11  VIEWS ON VALLEY GARDENS</title>
		<content> My class went to the Valley Gardens   
 to get peoples views about them.Most  
 people went there to walk and enjoy   
 the beautiful flower gardens.The part 
 people liked best was the natural part
 i.e. the pine woods.Everyone agreed it
 was worth the money spent on it.A lot 
 of people were upset that the sun     
 pavillion and collonade had lost its  
 organ and old-time dancing.Some older 
 people said they should bring back the
 dancing when you could have a cup of  
 tea and then dance.People we spoke to 
 werent really bothered about the spa  
 being developed.They thought the worst
 part was the vandals wrecking         
 everything.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
