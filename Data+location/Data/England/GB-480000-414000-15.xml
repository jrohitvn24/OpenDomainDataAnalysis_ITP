		<title>15Interviewing a Farmer</title>
		<content> Mr Proctor farms 135 acres,40 acres   
 of wheat, 30 acres of winter barley,  
 20 acres of sugar beet, the rest      
 spring barley.                        
  His grandmother started with 1 acre  
 and a cow, expanded it and soon had 9 
 sons to help.45 years ago they kept 3 
 milk cows, 8 bullocks and 20 pigs but 
 do not keep animals now.              
  He works the farm alone with a bit of
 casual labour when necessary whereas  
 it used to need his father,2 brothers,
 1 full time worker and 6 casual women 
 workers.The reason less labour is     
 needed now is because of mechanisation
 a change which became necessary when  
 Scunthorpe works expanded and Keadby  
 Power Station was built.Thus workers  
 left for higher wages.He felt that    
 community spirit was less now because 
 people were no longer connected to the
 land.He has 3 tractors,1 combine.     </content>
