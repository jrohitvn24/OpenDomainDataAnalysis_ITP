		<title>16Healthcare in N.St Ives.</title>
		<content>  There are no clinics or doctors  in  
 north St.Ives but there are  quite    
 a few in the other parts of St.Ives.  
 most people think their doctors or    
 clinics are  good. People are         
 satisfied with the care they receive  
 in hospitals ,and most do not have far
 to travel for medical care.More people
 go to the doctors  surgery than to a  
 clinic.                               
  When one is ill one really needs to  
 own a car as the surgeries are largely
 in the town centre.Elderly people have
 to rely on others to transport them to
 see a doctor or ask for a home visit. 
  If Hospital treatment is ever        
 necessary the N.St Ivian has a choice 
 of two hospitals,HINCHINGBROOKE,seven 
 miles away,or ADDENBROOKES,about      
 fifteen miles away.Both have excellent
 facilities.                           
                                       </content>
