		<title>18Agriculture Around Cornard</title>
		<content>Most of the farms in the area grow     
arable crops in large fields to allow  
machinery to work economically. Winter 
wheat, barley and oil-seed rape are    
sown in the autumn soon after the      
previous crop has been harvested - the 
land is not allowed to rest for long! A
little barley is sown in the spring    
along with a quantity of sugar beet.   
Harvest time for the grain crops and   
rape is late summer through to         
autumn, and on through winter for      
the sugar beet. Some grain is          
exported, some goes for brewing,       
baking or animal feed. The sugar beet  
goes to Bury  St Edmunds for           
processing. At Little Cornard is a     
herd of Jersey cows which produce      
milk, and at Cornard Tye is Wheldons.  
Few people work on the land now,       
perhaps only a handful full-time, and  
a few mums at fruit-picking time.      </content>
