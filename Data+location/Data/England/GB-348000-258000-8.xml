		<title>08LEOMINSTER SCHOOLCHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content> Every day I get up at 7-30 .a.m. and  
 start getting ready for school which  
 starts at 8-50. When I get to school I
 have a bit of play first. When we go  
 in at 8-50 we then go to register     
 which normally lasts about five       
 minutes and then to assembly.Then we  
 have an English lesson which ends at  
 10-40. Then it's time for play which  
 ends at 11-00.                        
 Next comes maths which is followed by 
 lunch time at 12-00. Then comes play, 
 some people have certain activities   
 such as singing and dancing which ends
 at 1-15.                              
 Next we have either History , Art or  
 Science etc. We have play at 2-20.    
 Then we have Singing Together followed
 by Reading Laboratory and at 3-30 we  
 go home.
