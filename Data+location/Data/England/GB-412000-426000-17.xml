		<content>   Shirley Manor House is also said to 
 possess a ghost.  The house was built 
 in 1859 by John Taylor, a manufacturer
 and dyer of cloth.  He sold the house 
 to James Sharp, a factory owner from  
 Bradford.  One of Mr Sharp's daughters
 was not allowed to marry her lover,   
 and as a result her spirit is still   
 said to walk the upstairs of the      
 house. Since then, the house has been 
 converted into an old people's home   
 and members of staff have sworn they  
 have seen her walking around upstairs.
 A past warden of the house would know 
 the identity of a resident who had    
 just died before being informed of the
 passing.  She said it was the spirit  
 of the person coming to say goodbye to
 her because she had known them for a  
 long time.
