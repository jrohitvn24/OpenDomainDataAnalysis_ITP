		<content>  Holly Hill Park,also known as        
{Winnards Copse}, is just off the A27  
 in  Barnes Lane.There is a mansion,   
 surrounded by gardens, which was built
 in 1910.When the owner died in 1977   
{Fareham Borough Council}preserved it  
 and changed it into an old peoples    
 home.                                 
  The{gardens}are very peaceful. There 
 are many different kinds of plants and
 animals. The{woodland}contains mainly 
 oak, sycamore and holly. The water    
 areas have water birds like mallards, 
 coots, moorhens, geese and many more. 
 There are also water rats and fish.   
 Most of the fish are golden carp.     
  There are many quiet places to sit,  
 the prettiest of which is beside the  
 waterfalls. There are{picnic sites}and
{car parks}which make it ideal for a   
 day out.
