		<title>07RIBBLE ESTUARY/SALT MARSHES</title>
		<content>{Spartina townsendii}(Spartina grass)  
 originated from South America.It moved
 north from Southampton to Lytham,it   
 now covers a vast area of Lytham      
 shoreline.It grows to about 18ins.    
 high.The long leaves are striped gold 
 and yellow and develop into tufts.It  
 is now an eyesore.In an attempt to    
 control it some of the grass has been 
 sprayed -without success.The silt     
 deposited by the Ribble has formed mud
 flats in the estuary.These are        
 colonised by the Spartina which       
 encourages further mud to settle,     
 raising the level of the salt marsh.  
   A commercial dock was constucted by 
 Squire Clifton in 1840 but in 1885 it 
 virtually ceased to function.The      
 Ribble Cruising Club now occupy those 
 docks where vessels are moored.The    
 Ribble Estuary once led to the port of
 Preston which closed in 1981.         </content>
