		<content> There was one village shop and two    
 Public houses, the Ship and the       
 Bell,(the latter was housed in the    
 building adjacent to the present post 
 office.)The village was much          
 quieter,less traffic,a horse-drawn bus
 went from the Ship to Sherston to     
 Yate.There were no bathrooms, no      
 electricity,the only water came from  
 the Pump House.No wireless, only      
 weekly newspapers.Regular garden      
 parties were held to raise money for  
 the village hall.Local children were  
 given half pence to deliver           
 groceries.The River Avon was the water
 supply during droughts.There was a    
 small pottery firm outside the        
 village.50 to 70 pupils attended the  
 village school.There were three       
 teachers at the school.
