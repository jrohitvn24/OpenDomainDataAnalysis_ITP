		<title>05The Railway Station</title>
		<content>   Wem Station is close to the town    
 centre.It is on the line from Crewe to
 Shrewsbury. We spent a whole day at   
 the station making a survey of it.    
 There were 25 trains that day.The     
 total number of people who got on the 
 trains was 157 and 135 of them were   
 going towards Shewsbury.The total     
 number of people getting off was      
 180 of whom 148 came from Shrewsbury. 
 The average lateness of the trains was
 6 minutes 12 seconds.We found a       
 pattern in the way people used the    
 line. Many more people travelled to   
 Shrewsbury rather than Crewe.Also most
 people went to Shrewsbury in the      
 morning between 8 a.m. and midday. In 
 the afternoon not many people went to 
 Shrewsbury or Crewe,but a lot of      
 people returned from Shrewsbury. Those
 going early or late were workers while
 the shoppers travelled in between.    </content>
