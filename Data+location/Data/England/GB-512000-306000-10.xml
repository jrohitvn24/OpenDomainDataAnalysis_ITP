		<title>10Trade Local Shop Northboro'</title>
		<content> The shop is a small supermarket       
 selling a variety of goods. There is a
 butchery department, grocery section, 
 off-licence, post office, green-      
 grocery section and house-hold goods. 
 Most people use the shop just for bits
 they have forgotten at their main     
 shop. Some people get the week's meat.
 The customers go into the shop for a  
 chat. There is a regular trade for the
 shop as many people use it for things 
 they buy everyday, e.g.bread. There is
 a notice-board outside the shop. A    
 typical notice on the notice-board    
 is "BMX bike for sale, Â£5O". The shop 
 has been run by Mick Thompson for 24  
 years. The post office is open during 
 shop hours and provides stamps, family
 allowance, pensions and National      
 Girobank. There is a newspaper        
 delivery service based at the shop.
