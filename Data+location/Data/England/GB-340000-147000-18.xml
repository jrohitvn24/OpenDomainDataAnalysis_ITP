		<title>18ECOLOGY IN THE WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   Dutch Elm Disease has changed the   
 appearance of the lowlands as elms    
 were very common and have not been    
 replaced. Willow trees are pollarded  
 for use in basket weaving.            
   Many farmers spray their hayfields  
 and this prevents wild flowers from   
 growing. The hedgerows are a good     
 source of plant life, in June we found
 40 different species of wild flower.  
   Birds of special interest include   
 heron, kingfisher, woodpeckers, owls  
 and a pair of hobbies nesting in a    
 disused crow's nest.                  
   Rabbits are the most common mammal. 
 There are a great variety of small    
 mammals, with several species of mice.
 Many different bats can also be found.
 At least 200 foxes inhabit the area   
 and 50 badgers, in 4 or 5 groups.     
   Footpaths are plentiful but very few
 are used regularly.                   </content>
