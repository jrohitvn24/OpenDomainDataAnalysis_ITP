		<title>04ANNETTE SMITH'S SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> Annette Smith is aged 13 and lives in 
 Sudbrooke.                            
  I get up at 7.45 am and get ready for
 school.At 8.30 I make my way to       
 Scothern by bike to catch the school  
 bus to welton. School starts at 9.10. 
 We have eight 35 min lessons during   
 the day with a break during the       
 morning and afternoon and 1 hour 5    
 mins for lunch.                       
 At 3.45 we go home. I get off the     
 school bus and then cycle back to     
 Sudbrooke.  When I get home the       
 Lincolnshire Echo is waiting on the   
 doorstep ready to be delivered.  After
 this I then have my tea and do my     
 homework until about 7pm. I then read 
 or watch television depending on what 
 is on. I always watch Dallas and      
 Dynasty. I usually go to bed at 9.30  
 and read by this time I am very tired.
