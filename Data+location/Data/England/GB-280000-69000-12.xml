		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE IN DENBURY</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning at about half 
 past seven and have my breakfast At   
 ten past eight we have to leave for my
 brother to catch the school bus. He   
 goes to secondary school in Newton    
 Abbot. Then mum drops me off at       
 Denbury School. At school we have two 
 teachers taking us for our lessons,   
 one in the morning and one in the     
 afternoon. We do a lot of project work
 and we often use the computer to help 
 us. We also do maths, language work,  
 games, music and drama. This term we  
 are doing a play called{"Kings and    
{Things".}After school I go home with  
 my friend Robert to wait for my mum.  
 When we get back I have my tea and    
 then watch T.V until about 9.30 p.m.  
 when I go to bed.
