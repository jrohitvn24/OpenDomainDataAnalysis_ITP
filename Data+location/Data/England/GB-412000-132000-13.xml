		<content> WITHIN OUR BLOCK IS THE NOW-DISUSED   
 OLD SARUM AIRFIELD.  UNTIL RECENTLY   
 THIS WAS A JOINT WARFARE ESTABLISHMENT
 USED BY ALL BRANCHES OF THE SERVICES. 
 IT WAS ABANDONED SOME FIVE YEARS AGO  
 AND IS NOW UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE   
 LAND SERVICES AGENCY. MANY SUGGESTIONS
 HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD FOR ITS POSSIBLE
 USE IN THE FUTURE BUT AT PRESENT ITS  
 LARGE MESSES, HANGARS AND SQUASH AND  
 TENNIS COURTS ARE LEFT IDLE.  SOME OF 
 THE HANGARS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED FOR   
 INDUSTRIAL USE AND THE OPTICA AIRCRAFT
 HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND IS BEING BUILT 
 HERE.  SOME OF THE HOUSING IS BEING   
 USED AS MARRIED QUARTERS FOR          
 SERVICEMEN FROM U.K.L.F AT WILTON BUT 
 THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE EMPTY AND    
 UNUSED.  ONE PROPOSITION PUT FORWARD  
 IS THAT THE SITE SHOULD BECOME A      
 SPORTS AND LEISURE COMPLEX FOR THE    
 PEOPLE OF SALISBURY AND DISTRICT.     </content>
