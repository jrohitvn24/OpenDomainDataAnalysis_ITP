		<title>09The River Dunt</title>
		<content>   The stream runs from Middle         
 Duntisbourne through Daglingworth to  
 the Manor House and is the reason for 
 the settlement and prosperity of the  
 valley through the ages.  Now it is   
 merely a pleasant amenity.            
   From the children's studies of the  
 upper stream, we found that the       
 creatures living there included       
 stonefly and mayfly larvae, masses of 
 freshwater shrimps and tadpoles,      
 flatworms, snails and 3 ducks.  Lower 
 down the stream the water creatures   
 changed and we found that it showed   
 signs of pollution for there were     
 thousands of tiny plant leeches,      
 mosquito larvae and red roundworms as 
 well as snails.  Perhaps cattle or    
 building works had caused the         
 pollution.  The stream was flowing    
 very fast due to heavy rains this     
 year.                                 </content>
