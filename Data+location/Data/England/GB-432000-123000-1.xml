		<content>      Our block consists of a piece of 
 rural Hampshire.  The block is cut    
 into two distinct sections by three   
 features.  Two of the features are man
 made, a{railway line}running from{    
{Romsey}to{Salisbury}and a {road}the{  
{A3057}from{Romsey}to{Stockbridge}and  
 one natural the famous trout stream{  
{The River Test.}The {railway}is south 
 of the river and the{road}to the      
 north.  Both closely follow the course
 of{The River Test.}To the northeast   
 are the twin settlements of{Timsbury} 
 and{Michelmersh}and to the southwest  
 are{Awbridge}and{Ratley.}In           
 conjunction with {The Test}are several
 large areas of still water belonging  
 to private clubs or individuals.  The 
{Test Valley}is wide and flat and we   
 were able to see right across the area
 we were surveying whether in{Awbridge}
 or{Michelmersh.                       </content>
