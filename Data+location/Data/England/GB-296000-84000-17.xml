		<title>17Lympstone"Village-in-Bloom"</title>
		<content>Total involvement by the villagers has 
made Lympstone a "joy to behold";plants
flow from every crevice.The community  
spirit that has swept through the      
village,involving all ages,is evident. 
The play-groups,school-children,Guides&amp;
Brownies,Scouts&amp;Cubs,Youth Club,three  
Churches,shops,inns,private&amp;council    
gardens&amp;the Royal Marine Estate all    
played a part.Cottages without gardens 
added colour with window boxes&amp;tubs    
cascading onto lanes and slipways.     
Cutting branches&amp;nettles,sweeping      
leaves and hoeing weeds have equally   
been dealt with.The village accepts the
hard-work as they try to fulfill the   
aims of the competition-to bring colour
to our towns.When tourists come and    
admire our efforts,we are well         
rewarded.

of Lympstone-in-Bloom 1973-85).        </content>
