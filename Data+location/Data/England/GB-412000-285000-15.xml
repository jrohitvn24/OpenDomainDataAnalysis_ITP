		<content>A Week in the Life of a local Doctor:- 
There are 5 doctors at the surgery     
visited.Surgery opens from 8:30am to   
12:30pm and 4:30pm to 6:30pm.The       
busiest day is Monday morning as the   
surgery is closed over the week-end    
apart from an emergency service on     
Saturday am .An appointment system is  
used,the time allocated to patients is 
5 to 10 minutes but a serious illness  
can take 15 minutes.Doctor Jeavons     
sees about 180 patients in a week.     
In all 800 patients visit the surgery  
weekly.The most common illnesses are   
respiratory,womens illnesses and       
psychological problems.                
Doctor Jeavons has about 75 weekly     
home visits.Mostly because the patient 
is too old or because of heart illness.
There are about 6 emergencies monthly. 
50% of patients receive prescriptions.
