		<title>11Typical Burgess Hill Diet</title>
		<content> The record of a nine year old's daily 
 food intake.                          
                                       
                                       
 For breakfast I had toast. My brother 
 had Weetabix, which is a cereal made  
 of wheat, and we had tea to drink.    
 Before I went to school I had a drink 
 of Ribena, a cordial made out of      
 blackcurrants. At lunch time I had    
 school dinners, when we had a choice  
 of mince or ravioli.  Ravioli is an   
 Italian dish made of pasta with meat  
 inside.  There were potatoes, carrots 
 and peas and a drink of water.  When I
 got home from school I had a drink of 
 orange and a packet of crisps.  For   
 dinner we had mince pie, cabbage and  
 potatoes, peas and gravy.  For pudding
 we had chocolate cake and orange to   
 drink.  Before I went to bed I had    
 another drink of blackcurrant.        </content>
