		<content>The main street of the village of      
Overton comprises old,renovated farm   
houses and cottages,in various states  
of repair.Built along the main street  
were no less than 10 farmhouses,with   
out-buildings,most of which are now    
private dwellings.Only 2 are still     
farmed.Several barn conversions have   
been made,one farmhouse is now a       
restaurant,and much of the centre of   
the village has been developed into    
2 large private estates.The old        
converted Methodist chapel now rubs    
shoulders with 2 modern bungalows.     
  A recent 80-house estate has been    
built to accomodate  workers from the  
Heysham Nuclear Power Station,and the  
projected Gas Terminal.
