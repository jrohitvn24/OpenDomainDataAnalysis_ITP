		<title>11Come to Ashington!</title>
		<content> Ashington,oh!what a glorious name,    
 And a name that has brought us a      
 little fame,                          
 As a coal mining village,             
 It triumphs in size,                  
 And the coal supply has not yet died. 
 We have our own banks and shops,      
 We have our own parks and schools,    
 But like every where else we have our 
 own fools,                            
 In Ashington there is no guarantee,   
 That our pavements and walls are      
 graffiti free,                        
 They are not and that is why,         
 In this poem I tell no lie.           
 But Ashigton has such lovely places,  
 And friendly people with smiling      
 faces,                                
 And organisations for the youth,      
 I tell you all of this is the TRUTH!  
                                       
                                       </content>
