		<content> We enjoyed visiting a modern butcher's
 shop in a 200 year old building with  
 16 people working there. The raw      
 carcases are sawn and chopped by hand 
 like the mechanised model{butcher}in  
 the window. They sell cooked meats and
 dairy produce as well. The smallest   
{grocer's}shop is 95 years old and has 
 not been modernised.The 6 assistants  
 sell cooked meats,delicatessen foods, 
 fruit,vegetables,groceries and sweets.
 One of our{draper's}shops employs 20  
 people and is about 100 years old with
 old-fashioned windows.Their range of  
 goods is carpets,materials and clothes
 for babies,ladies and young children. 
 They sell lovely hats decorated with  
 veils, feathers and artificial fruits.
 Most shops open from 8.30am to 5pm and
 close at 1pm on Thursday and all day  
 Sunday.2{supermarkets}are out of town 
 and we call them cash and carries.    </content>
