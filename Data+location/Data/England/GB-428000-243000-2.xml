		<content> Farming over the last 50 years has    
 condensed into much larger units.The  
 smallest farm in the survey is now 125
 acres which 50 years ago was a medium 
 size farm.However there is still one  
 farm worker who has about 6 cattle in 
 odd corners of fields who is a remnant
 of{verge farming}of the last century. 
                                       
 There are some small pieces of land in
 the villages used for horses and      
 ponies,but all the small holdings have
 now been absorbed into the larger     
 farms.These smaller farms nearly all  
 produced milk but milk is now produced
 on only two farms albeit on a large   
 scale (over 100 cows each).           
                                       
 Oilseed rape is grown on four farms   
 and peas on one.
