		<title>03The Ash Ranges Ecology.</title>
		<content>   The soil is poor, dry and sandy.    
 Most of the Ranges is covered with    
 Common Bracken which grows to a height
 of 2 metres. It is ideal cover for the
 animal life such as deer, rabbits and 
 foxes. There are badger setts too and 
 many snakes - adders, grass and smooth
 snakes and also lizards. The grey     
 squirrel is seen along with many      
 birds in the deciduous trees. Trees   
 such as Sweet and Horse Chestnut, Ash,
 Mountain Ash or Rowan, Beech, Oak,    
 Lime and Silver Birch.                
   There are many coniferous trees too,
 namely Pines, Larch, Grand Fir and    
 Noble Fir. There are a few wet patches
 on the Ranges as the whole area has a 
 high water table. There are           
 Bullrushes growing in these areas.    
 Many wild flowers grow in abundance.  
 Grasses and fungi grow in selected    
 areas.                                </content>
