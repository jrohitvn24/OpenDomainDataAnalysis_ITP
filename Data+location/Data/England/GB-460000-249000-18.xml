		<title>18Daily Life for a Young Mum.</title>
		<content>The day starts at about 7.00a.m. with  
the first noises from the toddler's    
cot.The trick is to have the rest of   
the family dressed and ready before the
toddler gets up, otherwise chaos reigns
and everybody is late.At 9.30a.m. the  
washing machine engineer arrives and it
emerges that we use our washing machine
three times as often as the average.   
That is why it is prematurely aged.Time
to dash to the mobile clinic where the 
toddler is weighed and smiles through  
his injection.I beam proudly, then he  
screams.After lunch and a peaceful rest
we collect big sister from school and  
drive the seven miles to the           
supermarket.The toddler sits in the    
trolley and,smiling again, behaves     
appallingly.Everyone smiles back,      
proving that the British like children.
Home for supper,baths and bed.On a good
day,all is quiet by7.00p.m.            </content>
