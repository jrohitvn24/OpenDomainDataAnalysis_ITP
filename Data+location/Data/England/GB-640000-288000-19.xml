		<title>19 Ringsfield Church.</title>
		<content> Ringsfield is a small village to the  
SW of Beccles.The church roof is       
thatched and the tower square with     
flint walls.Over the porch is a sun-   
dial and the metal doors beneath show  
a robin on its nest.On the new lectern 
and kneelers are more robins to        
commemorate a robin who nested in      
the old lectern.All the pew ends are   
carved as is the pulpit.  Many of the  
windows are beautiful stained          
glass.The bells were rehung in 1957    
and there is one newer bell.There are  
carved marble angels on a tomb outside 
on a Princesses grave.  Part of the    
churchyard is left rough as part of    
some work by the Nature Conservancy to 
encourage wildlife.  The church and    
churchyard are in very good condition  
for such a tiny congregation.          
 Well worth a visit.
