		<title>11Wild life in Chelmsley Wood</title>
		<content> Chelmsley Wood is mainly residential  
 but it includes plenty of wildlife.   
 You can find sparrows, housemartins,  
 blackbirds and magpies. Insects of    
 various kinds can also be traced. Wild
 rabbits, squirrels and hares are also 
 common place. Rivers contain minnows  
 and stickleback, frogs and dragonflies
 can be found in small streams.        
 Pollution is a major problem and      
 attempts to clean up the enviroment   
 have been included in the project     
 "Kingfisher".(a scheme involving      
 schools and the local community to    
 clean up the river Cole). Unfortunatly
 swans and ducks are still being killed
 by fishermens lead shot. Other forms  
 of pollution include litter and carbon
 monoxide poisoning, the latter having 
 disastrous effects on animal and human
 life alike.                           
                                       </content>
