 Although the 1981 Census showed an    
 increased population in the rural     
 areas this was due mainly to retired  
 people moving to the villages from the
 towns, and the population overall is  
 rather elderly.                       
 Few people living in the Dowlish Wake 
 area are also employed there. The     
 people that are employed are          
 mainly in agriculture, most work      
 outside the area in the larger centres
 of population.
