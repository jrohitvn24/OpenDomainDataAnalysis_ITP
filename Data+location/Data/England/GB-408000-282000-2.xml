		<content>Moseley Bog is believed to have had a  
Bronze Age settlement, but the only    
evidence are cracked stones. We are not
sure of there use. In 1542 Moseley Bog 
appeared in history books when Matthew 
Boulton used the Great or Old Pool to  
help Sarehole Mill grind corn..The mill
stream was not big enough to run the   
mill by itself. In 1768 Sarehole Mill  
was used for making blades and wire. In
1850 the mill was closed due to the    
discovery of steam power.The mill pool 
was drained. In 1980 somebody wanted to
build houses on the Bog. There was a   
meeting and the council stopped the    
houses from being built. A few years   
ago the Nature Conservancy Council     
declared the Bog a site of scientific  
interest. Now the lower playing field  
at Pickwick is to join the Bog as a    
site of special scientific interest.
