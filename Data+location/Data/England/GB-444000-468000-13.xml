		<title>13HEALTH CARE IN HELPERBY</title>
		<content>{Dr Waud was a General Practioner in   
{Helperby from 1938 until his          
{retirement in 1974.He saw many changes
{in health care between those years.In 
{the early years he had a very large   
{area to look after by himself whereas 
{now there are four doctors (based at  
{Boroughbridge) to do the same job.    
{This was mainly because before the    
{National Health Service arrived he    
{needed many patients in order to make 
{a living.                             
{  Dr Waud also felt rather guilty     
{in,for instance, charging a couple one
{guinea (110 pence) for the delivery of
{their baby when the father was only   
{earning 38/6d (Â£1.92\) as a farm      
{labourer.The National Health Service  
{was the 'best thing that ever happened
{to me' for it gave the Doctor a       
{guaranteed income for each person     
{on his 'dispensing list'.}            </content>
