		<title>11HOUSING DEVELOPMENT: L'BORO</title>
		<content> In the 1930's ribbon development along
 Nanpantan Road was evident and only a 
 few houses were older than this,many  
 of them being farmhouses*.Then in the 
 1960's,1970's &amp; 1980's there was an   
 infill when much of the land once     
 owned by farmers was developed by     
 builders.There is a new estate in our 
 D-block which was started in 1982,    
 houses are still being built there in 
 1985.Most of these have double garages
 and all of them are detached.The      
 majority of houses in our D-block     
 would cost over Â£40,000.              
 The single greatest employer of people
 is the teaching profession with the   
 university coming a close second,     
 followed by people employed by Hawker 
 Siddley.                              
                                       
 * dating from about 1750 which was    
 when land enclosure came to our area. </content>
