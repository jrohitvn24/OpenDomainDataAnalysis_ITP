		<title>03A DAY FOR A GIRL IN CURY</title>
		<content>     I get out of bed, have a wash and 
 get dressed. Then I go out to play    
 with Paul. I ride my bike, catching or
 tigging them. About one o clock I go  
 in for my dinner. I like chips and    
 steak. After I play netball or cricket
 with my friends Paul and Vonea, who   
 are both ten. My favourite game is    
 netball. (I like drawing or painting  
 as a hobby). Then I come in and watch 
 television. I ilke watching the       
 'A'Team, but that is finished now. So 
 now I watch 'Scarecrow and Mrs King'. 
 I like watching cartoons and my       
 favourite character is Dog Tanian. I  
 go to bed at half past eight to nine  
 and read for ten minutes. I like      
 reading 'Charlie and the Chocolate    
 Factory','The Famous Five' and 'Secret
 Seven'books. I mainly read in bed     
 because I can concentrate better.
