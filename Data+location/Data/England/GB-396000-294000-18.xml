 popularity  is  still  growing.  Most 
 anglers seem to start  on local canals
 and move onto the many {local  fishing
{clubs}who travel out of the area for  
{match  fishing.  }The  populariy  of  
 football as a spectator sport seems to
 be diminishing (WBA,  Wolves,  Walsall
 and  Aston  Villa  are all very close,
{WBA }is  the  most  popular)  but  its
 popularity as a participation sport is
 growing,  particularly  the  {Sunday

{Harriers }in  the  area,   athletics  
 remains  popular  and  many   school  
 children said they liked going to the 
{speedway.}There is an increase in the 
 popularity  of  breeding  and  keeping
