{deer,mink, stoats, squirrels,ducks,   
{and weasels.}He shoots most of them   
 because they are pests.He uses a 12   
 bore for everything except deer.He    
 shoots deer with a 2.70 rifle.He      
 shoots nearly all these pests but     
 gassing and snaring are used occasion-
 ally. He breeds pheasants and partri- 
 dge to shoot in the shooting season.  
 He has to debeak the small pheasants  
 to stop them pecking each other.He has
 12 beaters on a shoot and 8 to 10 guns
 and he pays them 10 pounds.He uses    
 dogs for picking up pheasants etc.He  
 feeds the pheasants on wheat and      
 pellets.He has had mink on the estate 
 for four years.There are Fallow deer  
 and Muntjak deer but no Roe deer on
