		<content>  The study area is comprised mainly of
 gently undulating, intensively managed
 arable land.{The Croome Estate}and    
 disused airfield have conspicuously   
 strong influences on the area.        
  Hedgerows are mainly low cut with{elm
{suckers, hawthorn, ash}and{field maple
 dominant. Associated plant species    
 noted include{red and white campion,  
{white bryony}and{old man's beard      
 amongst many other common species. Few
 mature hedgerow trees were noted but  
 where present were mainly of{oak}and  
{ash.}There was some evidence in parts 
 of hedgerow removal.                  
  Areas of particular ecological       
 interest are composed mainly of small 
 pockets of rough ground containing a  
 very varied flora - this influences   
 the variety of animal life (especially
 conspicuous being{Lepidoptera}and     
 other{insects).}Examples observed     </content>
