		<content>  Hednesford is presently prospering. A
wide range of services are offered and 
there is a twice weekly market.        
  Shopkeepers are recovering from two  
setbacks to trade. In 1981 the relaying
of sewer pipes closed Market Street.   
The miners' strike of 1984/85 led to   
closure of firms and a reduction of    
spending power.                        
  The shopping centre attracts         
customers from a wide area. Recently   
built new estates have helped to       
produce more custom. Unfortunately,    
businesses such  as Lloyds Bank and    
the Post Office have not been given    
full status.                           
  Trade has not yet fullly recovered   
but the present revival should continue
into the future.
