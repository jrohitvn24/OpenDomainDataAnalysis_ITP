		<title>01Area Summary:N.&amp; O.Silton</title>
		<content> This area is principally farmland     
 rising to forest and moorland in the  
 North West.There are two settlements; 
 Nether Silton and Over Silton which   
 are small hamlets with populations of 
 approximately 56 and 67 respectively. 
 Very little recent building has taken 
 place in Nether Silton where as Over  
 Silton has been developed with        
 relatively large new houses.The       
 farmland all lies below 200 metres and
 is scattered with mixed family-run    
 farms.The forest area is uninhabited  
 and planted mainly with coniferous    
 softwoods.It is run by the Forestry   
 Commission.The area is flanked to the 
 West by the A19 trunk road which      
 provides easy access to Teesside to   
 the North and York to the South.This  
 is a major factor in attracting people
 to the area-they can live in the      
 country yet easily reach the towns.   </content>
