		<title>09A FARM IN STAINFORTH (3)</title>
		<content> There are some farms where the girls  
 do a lot of the farm work as well, but
 this is not the rule. The farmhouse   
 kitchen is large and is where most of 
 the activity takes place. Meals are   
 cooked on a wood-burning stove, by    
 which lie several farm cats. Some     
 produce is grown in the large garden, 
 but most of the supplies are brought  
 in from the nearby town of Settle.    
 Though the farmer uses modern         
 machinery and modern methods of       
 farming, he is nevertheless carrying  
 on an ancient way of life, in which   
 people are slow to change and like to 
 preserve all that is good of the past.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
