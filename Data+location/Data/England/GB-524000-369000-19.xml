		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN OAP</title>
		<content>  I interviewed an old lady            
 aged 80. Living alone, she enjoys     
 company and finds that television,    
 especially quizzes, while away time.  
 She also likes to garden and tend     
 indoor house plants, as many older    
 people do. Her groceries are delivered
 to her home, as she suffers from      
 arthritis. However, she prepares her  
 own meals.                            
  She organises all her own household  
 tasks by the rhyme-"Wash on Monday,   
 Iron on Tuesday", and so on. She      
 belongs to the Methodist Fellowship   
 and Over-60 Club. Knitting is one of  
 her favourite pastimes.               
     She frequently reminisces         
 and her house is cluttered with       
 bric-a-brac from the past. Her cat is 
 much fondled and regarded as a        
 valuable companion.
