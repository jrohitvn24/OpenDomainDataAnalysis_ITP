		<title>08Supernatural Newton/Dunham</title>
		<content> Newton can claim many haunted houses. 
 Perhaps the most notorious is the     
 White Hart Inn where Buck Forrester,  
 one time landlord of the pub, who died
 in 1940 is said to appear on the      
 upstairs landing. His last visitation 
 was to a local lady who works at the  
 Inn.  He is said to be guarding his   
 hoard of money. Another such haunted  
 house is Old Hall Farm, a listed      
 building, where children sleeping in  
 an upstairs room have seen an old man 
 and footsteps have sometimes been     
 heard when no one was apparently      
 upstairs.  Hall Farm, North Clifton is
 reputed to be the haunting ground of a
 woman. Also at North Clifton a ghostly
 dog has been seen crossing the road   
 near a disused railway station.The    
 more down to  earth in the area tend  
 to discount the stories.
