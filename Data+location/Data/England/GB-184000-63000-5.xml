		<content>               We interviewed Mrs Carol
 Brown of 3 Carloggas Close,about the  
 Friendship Group. Mrs Brown started   
 the group in 1977.The Group provides  
 enjoyment,entertainment,and a monthly 
 outing.Each member pays 15 pence a    
 week.Mrs Brown makes and sells soft   
 toys to help the funds.Ages in the    
 group vary from 69 to the 90 year old 
 Mrs Glover.Mrs Brown enjoys running   
 the group,and nursed for 40 years.    
 There are 20 members,and meetings are 
 held in Mrs Brown's house every Monday
 from 2.30 - 4.30.Croquet and cards are
 popular with the members.             
    I interviewed the Warden in charge 
 of 12 bungalows,purpose built for the 
 elderly 7 years ago at Carloggas.There
 are 20 mainly local married couples.  
 She provides the meals for some,runs  
 them to the doctor /dentist,and checks
 them daily.                           </content>
