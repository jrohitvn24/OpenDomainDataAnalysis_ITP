		<title>12CLAVERING PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> At Clavering School we do many things.
 For normal school work we do Fletcher 
 Maths, Mainline English and Fractions.
 For good work we get teampoints. The  
 teams are Griffin, Pegasus, Unicorn,  
 and Centaur each with a captain and   
 vice-captain. Every month the team    
 with most points receives a trophy. We
 have assemblies every day except      
 Tuesdays. There are ten teachers      
 including Mr. Russell the head teacher
 and Mr.Ward the deputy head who is my 
 teacher. Each year we have a Sports   
 Day, Summer Fair and Christmas        
 Pantomime. We also have several       
 concerts which include our orchestra  
 and choir. The orchestra has about    
 thirty members playing recorders,     
 woodwind, strings, brass and          
 percussion. I play'cello. On Sports   
 Day we all enter races and try to win 
 points for our team.                  </content>
