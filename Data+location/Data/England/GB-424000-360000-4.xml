		<title>04Yew Tree 2000 years old</title>
		<content> In Church Town there is an old yew    
 tree.It is thought to be 2000 years   
 old.It grows in the church yard.Around
 it is an iron fence to protect it.On  
 the fence are dates of wars and other 
 things that the tree has grown        
 through.The tree is quite tall.The    
 church is Norman and has a tower with 
 a flag-staff on it.You can see how the
 rain has worn away the bumpy bits on  
 the wall so it is quite smooth.In the 
 porch are some stone slabs with       
 carvings on them.Outside are lots of  
 lots of graves,some dating back to the
 17th century.By the church are two    
 stone coffins with a little raised bit
 of stone for the head to rest on.
