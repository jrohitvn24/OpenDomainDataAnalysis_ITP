		<title>12CANTLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Cantley is a small village situated  
 about 3 miles south east of Doncaster.
  The{buildings}are predominantly      
 residential and vary greatly in both  
 age and style.The largest building is 
{Cantley Hall}built about 300 years ago
 and still a private residence.There   
 are also some small cottages built    
 about the same period.During the last 
 20 years there has been some{new      
{development,}which has doubled the    
 number of homes.                      
  The villagers have no special        
{services}and must go elsewhere for    
 medical services,shops and leisure    
 activities.There are only two{buses  }
 per week from the village to the town.
  One of the main{disadvantages}of     
 living in the village is the noise    
 from vehicles passing constantly day &amp;
 night.During peak times 750 vehicles  
 per hour have been counted.           </content>
