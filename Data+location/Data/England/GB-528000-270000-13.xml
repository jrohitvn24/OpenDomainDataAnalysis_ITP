		<title>13Housing in the Hemingfords</title>
		<content> Housing in the Hemingfords is         
 extremely varied in type and value.   
 Most housing is privately owned,      
 although there are two small areas of 
 council houses, one in Hemingford Grey
 around Pound Rd and another in        
 Hemigford Abbots in Rideaway Drive.   
 These last houses are distinctive in  
 being thatched council houses. Housing
 in Hemingford Abbots tends to be of   
 great architectural interest. Most    
 houses are thatched and many date from
 Elizabethan times. All are much sought
 after because of their character and  
 charm. the village of Hemingford      
 Abbots attracts tourists from this    
 country and abroad, some just passing 
 through and others to stay in the     
 caravan site by the river.
