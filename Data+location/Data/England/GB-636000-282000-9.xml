Some interesting facts from the records
of the old school log books of         
Ilketshall St. Lawrence Primary School:
                                       
(1) 26 headteachers have been in       
charge of the school during the last   
100 years.                             
                                       
(2) 23 members of the same  family     
started their education and many       
completed their school life at St.     
Lawrence.                              
                                       
(3) The school was closed for  3 months
in 1903 after an outbreak of scarlet   
fever.                                 
                                       
(4) In 1914 the school nurse brought a 
live baby for the girls to learn to    
bath.
