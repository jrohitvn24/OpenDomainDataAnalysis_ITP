		<content>  The Technical College in Peterborough
 can be found next to the City's major 
 park. It is a large building that     
 offers a wide range of courses to     
 students from all over the area. The  
 college offers a number of academic,  
 practical and technical courses to    
 young people over the age of sixteen. 
 Some of the most popular courses      
 include plumbing, nursery nursing and 
 typing. When surveyed most students   
 enjoyed going to the technical college
 and liked the freedom that they were  
 given. Some of the students           
 interviewed spent four days a week    
 training at work and then one day at  
 college. The college is much bigger   
 than most secondary schools and has   
 many staff rooms, student rest rooms, 
 cafes and a large library, It also has
 a large number of workshops.
