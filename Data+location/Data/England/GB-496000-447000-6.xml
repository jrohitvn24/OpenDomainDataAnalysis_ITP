		<content> There is a great variety of housing in
 our block.Much of it is{Victorian}or  
 even older.There are quite a number of
{farms}both tennanted and private and  
 many{tied cottages}most of which are  
 owned by{Lord Hotham}who lives at     
 Dalton Hall.The three villages contain
 a mixture of old and modern houses and
 small council estates.Mostly the      
 pattern is ribbon development with    
 very little infill.The modern building
 is of{brick}with{pantile}roofs.Much of
 the older housing is of brick and tile
 also but there are many buildings made
 from{chalk}which is found locally.The 
 chalk is not very good for building as
 it is porous and the frost can crack  
 the blocks.
