		<title>02PLASHETT _ FARMING</title>
		<content>  Farming in this area is mostly       
 grassland  grazed by dairy cattle.    
 However there is some cereal          
 production , mostly wheat and barley  
 with a little maize. The land is      
 gently undulating , divided by a few  
 minor roads. The fields are generally 
 divided by hedges mostly hawthorn and 
 blackberry. There are seventeen farms 
 named on the map of which three are   
 not presently working. The houses are 
 mostly occupied by retired farmers.   
 One of the farms produces eggs and    
 another uses organic methods. The     
 flour produced at this farm is used by
 a Brighton  baker . There are         
 at least three farms with large       
 acreages with agricultural workers    
 living in tied cottages . The soil is 
 a mixture of chalk and clay and       
 drainage can be a problem.
