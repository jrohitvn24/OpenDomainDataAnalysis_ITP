		<title>06Farming in Dinnington Area.</title>
		<content> Most of the area around Dinnington is 
{agricultural land.}Some of the farms  
 are owner occupied but others are     
 tenant farmers, Lord Ridley of Blagdon
 is the principle land owner in the    
 district. The farming is varied, some 
 of the crops being grown in 1985 are  
 barley, peas,winter wheat,hay for the 
 animals winter feed and oil seed      
 rape. Oil seed rape is grown for its  
 vegetable oil, the tiny seeds are     
 crushed and the oil is produced. Some 
 of the land is grazing for cattle     
 being fattened for meat,there are also
 dairy cows, and sheep.Some farms have 
 pigs, chickens,ducks and horses. Some 
 of the farms have had {Opencast Coal}}
 workings on their land,this has caused
 great disruption, it can take up to a 
 generation before the land is fully   
 productive after{Opencast.}The farmers
 are pleased the Project is finished.  </content>
