		<title>10WOODINGDEAN'S SCHOOL CHANGES</title>
		<content> There are three main school sites in  
 Woodingdean.At present all three cater
 for pupils under 12 in a series of    
 first and middle schools.The system   
 was introduced to the Brighton area in
 1972 the year before East Sussex      
 Education Authority took control.     
 Previously there had been             
 Infant and Junior (5-11).In 1985 this 
 system is to be reintroduced.The      
 present Woodingdean Middle School was 
 built as a Primary School in the early
 1950's.It is a one-story brick        
 building set in large playing fields. 
 During 1984-5 major alterations       
 have been made involving pupils and   
 staff in constant change.At the end of
 the school year half the school       
 population will enter Secondary       
 School.At the beginning of September  
 1985 Woodingdean Primary School will  
 replace Woodingdean Middle School.    </content>
