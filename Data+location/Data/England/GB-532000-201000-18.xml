		<content>  St Mary's Church of the Virgin was   
 built in 1418. The font dates from    
 1318 and is evidence of an earlier    
 wooden church. The earliest graves are
 from Henry 8th. The latest graves are 
 from 1850. The parish records date    
 from 1559. There is mention of a      
 priest at Cheshunt in the Domesday    
 survey 1086. There is a royal coat of 
 arms of Charles the second. The church
 has 47 different masons marks. There  
 are 33,000 people in the parish and 2 
 extra churches, St. Clements and      
 Little St. Marys. The vicar's work    
 includes writing sermons and          
 news sheets and visiting hospitals and
 schools. His favourite work is helping
 people in trouble. There are about 100
 weddings each year. 160 people attend 
 the church each Sunday.
