		<title>08Pollution:Water &amp; Lorries</title>
		<content>    At Langford the reservoir takes{35 
{Million }Gallons of water from the    
 Chelmer and Blackwater rivers: The    
 water is used locally but also pumped 
 to the big reservoir at Hanningfield  
 12 miles to the south.This year the   
 chemists at Langford have been testing
 the water for nitrates - used by      
 farmers as a fertiliser - because the 
 heavy rain has washed them into the   
 rivers.They say that the levels of    
 Nitrates are a little higher but well 
 below any danger level.               
    The other pollution comes from     
 lorries.The local gravel pits have    
 supplied much to the building of the  
 Chelmsford By-Pass and the M.25 :     
 Local residents in Woodham Walter and 
 Langford complain of the noise of     
 these Lorries going through their     
 villages.
