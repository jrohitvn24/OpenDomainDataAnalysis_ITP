		<content>         The letter referred to on page
 7 resulted in a petition with 2,560   
 signatures.                           
 The local doctors based in Dereham, do
 not believe the building of a surgery 
 in Toftwood is a good idea. They argue
 that improving transport to the two   
 surgeries in the town is more         
 sensible as a new surgery in Toftwood 
 would only duplicate existing         
 facilities in Dereham. A new surgery  
 would cost at least Â£250,000 and the  
 Norfolk Area Health Authority is not  
 willing to provide money for this     
 project in view of the medical        
 facilities already available in the   
 Dereham area. It is perhaps           
 unfortunate that all medical          
 facilities are concentrated in Dereham
 town centre and yet the new housing   
 estates are being built further and   
 further away from these facilities.   </content>
