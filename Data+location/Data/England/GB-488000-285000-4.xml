 "There used to be a shop which I      
 owned,I sold sweets,crisps and        
 cigarettes.Next to the turning into   
 LITTLE OAKLEY,there used to be a well 
 called Bears Well where villagers     
 and people who passed by would get    
 their water from.When the 2nd world   
 war started in 1939 big lorries       
 carrying bombs came through the       
 village making a lot of noise,however 
 the village was not blitzed.When      
 Coventry was bombed you could see the 
 sky lighting up,from miles away.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
