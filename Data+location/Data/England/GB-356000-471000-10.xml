		<title>10Gas comes to Melling.</title>
		<content>                                       
   Arkholme village has no main drains 
but it does have GAS! This is carried  
across the river to Melling but only to
one road. People were asked if they    
were interested in having gas supplied 
and enough must have said yes.         
   So in June yellow marks were        
painted on the main road and then      
came workmen,machines and piles of     
bright yellow pipes. Roadwork signs    
and traffic lights were put in place   
and the road machine began.As the      
pipes snaked along we waited longer    
at the lights. The houses beside the   
narrow road were full of dust and      
grit. The machine cut through both the 
electricity cables and  water pipes.   
On two evenings the road was closed    
to traffic when they were digging      
along the narrowest part. The fee for  
connection will be 450 pounds.         </content>
