		<title>20A General View of the Area.</title>
		<content>        The area of this particular    
 section of the project is marked by   
 Newburgh in the north-west, Dalton in 
 the south-west, and the western adge  
 of Appley Bridge in the east.         
        The northern boundary crosses  
 Parbold Hill, and the southern        
 boundary crosses Ashurst's Beacon.    
 These two hills are separated by the  
 Douglas Valley and delineate the main 
 characteristics of the area.          
        The bulk of the population     
 inhabit Parbold which, though not in  
 the centre of the area of our         
 attention, is very much the focal     
 point of the district.                
        It is a rural farming area     
 with a variety of landscapes within   
 its boundaries. The views of North    
 Wales, Merseyside, the Fylde Coast,&amp;  
 the Lake District from Parbold and    
 Ashurst Hills are spectacular.        </content>
