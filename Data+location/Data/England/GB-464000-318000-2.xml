 Ragdale is a small village or hamlet, 
 situated in North-East Leicestershire.
 8 miles to the west lies the town of  
 Loughborough and 6 miles to the east  
 is the market town of Melton Mowbray. 
                                       
 Ragdale _ or Rakedale or Wreakdale as 
 it was called in past centuries _     
 derives its name from a break or      
 valley in the vicinity, traversed by a
 shallow brook, which flows into the   
 river Wreake at Hoby, some two miles  
 south of Ragdale.                     
                                       
 In the 1983 census Ragdale's          
 population was estimated at 115.  The 
 Electoral Roll for 1985 has 86 names  
 on it.
