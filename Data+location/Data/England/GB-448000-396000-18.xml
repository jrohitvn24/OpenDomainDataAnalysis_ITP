		<title>18A farm in Conisbrough</title>
		<content> Hill Top farm dates from the 19th.    
 century. Many of the original         
 buildings are now derelict. Of eight  
 buildings only two are used. Most of  
 the buildings and walls are made of   
 limestone, quarried on the farm       
 itself. There was intended to be      
 500acres of fields, but now there are 
 only 220 acres making 25 fields,      
 allcontaining crops. There have been  
 many changes during the last twenty   
 years. Much more mmachinery is now in 
 use. Whilst farms have got smaller,   
 tractors and ploughs have got bigger. 
 Ther is almost apiece of machinery for
 every farm job. Twenty years ago the  
 farm had servants and seven hands to  
 work on the land. Now there are no    
 servants and only two people are      
 responsible for all the farm work. In 
 good weather the farmer could work    
 from 9.00am until 9.00pm.             </content>
