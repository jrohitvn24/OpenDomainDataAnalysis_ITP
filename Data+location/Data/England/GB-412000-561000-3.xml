		<title>03FARMING AROUND CRAWCROOK.</title>
		<content> Farming in the area has made two major
 changes in the last thirty years.     
 Nowadays the principal farming is     
 for beef cattle, sheep, pigs and      
 horses.  The land is either used for  
 intensive grazing, with hay           
 harvesting, rough pasture and a small 
 amount of root cropping and barley for
 animal winter feedstuffs. A small     
 amount of rape is also grown.         
  Thirty years ago most farms were     
 mixed arable farms. Most changed to   
 Dairy Farming during the 1950's.      
 Changes in E.E.C. and M.M.B policies  
 have rendered dairy farming in the    
 area unprofitable and farmers have    
 changed to stock rearing.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
