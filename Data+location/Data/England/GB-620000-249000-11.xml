Tne landscape of the region is         
characterised by the typically         
undulating fields and water meadows.   
The Fynn washes out its meandering     
valley creating some surprisingly      
steep little hills and lays many       
little lanes open to the prospect of   
winter floods. The absence of really   
big hills gives some wide vistas and   
the sky is seen to dominate the whole  
in the same way as it does in          
Constable's paintings. So few man-made 
things impinge on the whole that       
pylons dominate views and can be seen  
for mile after mile marching across the
fields.Hedgerows remain a feature of   
the landscape but there are places     
where they have been uprooted with     
seeming abandon.
