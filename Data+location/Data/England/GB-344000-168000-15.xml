		<content> The School has a good tradition of    
 teaching its pupils to produce good   
 work in their books.                  
 But a recent addition to the work of  
 the children is learning how to use   
{computers.}We bought our first        
 computer in 1983 and now, in 1985, we 
 have 5 computers, each with its own   
 disc drive. The computers are used in 
 three main ways in the School;-       
  -as machines on which the children   
 can practice such drills as           
 multiplication tables, spellings,etc. 
  -as stimuli for creative writing with
 open-ended adventure stories being set
 by the computer for the pupils to     
 finish                                
  -as machines on which the older      
 children can learn how to program     
 computers in a simple way.            
 The Teachers complain that they can   
 only just keep up with the children!  </content>
