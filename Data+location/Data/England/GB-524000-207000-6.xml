		<title>06RELIGION _ The Church Tower</title>
		<content>{ The church tower}needs constant      
 repair as its frame is very weak. The 
 worn spiral stairs are made of        
 concrete. The church has just bought a
 new weather vane. There are six bells 
 altogether and they are made of bell  
 metal. The oldest bell was made in the
 16th century. Bell ringing practises  
 are held on Tuesday night and the     
 bells are rung on Sunday and at       
 weddings. The bells can be rung by a  
 group or by one person because of a   
 box with little strings leading to the
 bells. You do not get the full effect 
 but it is sometimes useful. The bells 
 are designed so that four swing one   
 way and two swing the other. This is  
 so that the tower does not rock. The  
 old clock cannot be relied on to chime
 regularly. It chimes on one of the    
 bells but it is a totally different   
 mechanism from the bells.             </content>
