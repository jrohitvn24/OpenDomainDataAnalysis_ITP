		<title>11THE NEW A41 BYPASS</title>
		<content> The A 41 at Boxmoor has had traffic   
 jams for years as people drive to work
 each day, and most think that a bypass
 is needed. The agreed route, however, 
 is difficult to justify and will      
 affect the people of Hemel by using   
 land on Boxmoor and Roughdown Commons 
 by coming down into the valley where  
 more people can hear and see it. By   
 affecting more residential property it
 will be dearer to build and it will   
 have to be carried over marshy land.  
 The Inspector's Report lists many     
 pointsfor and against it."Preservation
 of Investment" means that commercial  
 needs are important and two holes of  
 the Council Golf Course were thought  
 to be more of a loss than Roughdown   
 Common, a registered S.S.I with 25    
 kinds of trees and a specialised chalk
 flora. It seems a pity that Common    
 rights and ecology will be sacrificed.</content>
