		<title>02IMPRESSIONS OF LEAMINGTON.</title>
		<content>   Leamington is nice to live in.      
 Because it's so small, if you go      
 anywhere, you're bound to meet someone
 you know. The spa-water isn't nice,   
 it's too salty.                       
   Leamington has a large number of    
 concerts and annual events. Many of   
 the local people are involved in      
 these.                                
 Every year, we have a peace festival  
 in the Pump Room Gardens. This land is
 now under threat from a building firm 
 who want to build flats on it. This   
 would mean that a large area of       
 greenery would be lost. Will the Pump 
 Room Gardens be here in 900 years     
 time? The Parish Church is the third  
 largest in England. Will it still be  
 the same in 900 years?                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
