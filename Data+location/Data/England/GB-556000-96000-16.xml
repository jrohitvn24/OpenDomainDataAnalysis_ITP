		<title>16Housing 2: West Meads</title>
		<content>    The following information is based 
 on an interview with a local estate   
 agent, Mr Colin Light.                
    The area contains much new housing,
 for example the Warren, as Eastbourne 
 has developed westwards towards the   
 Downs in the 1970s and 80s. These new 
 homes are of good quality and         
 expensive. Today there is greater     
 demand for small houses as they are   
 easier to run and less expensive. This
 is an important factor as many old    
 people retire to Eastbourne.          
    Many of the large, old, family     
 houses that were built at the end of  
 the 19th century have now been        
 converted into flats. In Victorian    
 times the wealthy had large families  
 and also neaded to accomodate four or 
 five servants. This is clearly no     
 longer practicable and therefore older
 houses have been split up.            </content>
