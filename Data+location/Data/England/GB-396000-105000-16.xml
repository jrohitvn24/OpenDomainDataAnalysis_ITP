 My house is at the bottom of a hill,  
 it is in Bradford near Witchampton.   
 We are no.1, Bradford Farm Cottages   
 My next door neighbour is no.3.  My   
 house is 140 years old. Some of the   
 house is 150 years old I think it is  
 made of brick with rendering on the   
 walls. There is a porch with          
 honeysuckle on the wall. It has 5     
 windows at the front, it has slates on
 the roof and 2 chimneys made of brick.
 We are surrounded with big fields and 
 trees. My house is semi_detached and  
 it is white.

 My house is detached it is made of    
 stone my house used to be a police    
 house and it is very old. Out of my   
 bedroom window I can see the school   
 and an old thatched house. We have    
 tomatoes in the garden and a porch.   </content>
