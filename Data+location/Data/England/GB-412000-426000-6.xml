		<content> unique routine based on set moves     
 which range from free flowing         
 gymnastic twists and turns to jerky,  
 robotic type movements.  Prestige     
 comes from performing a demanding     
 routine or developing new moves.      
 Anyone who just copies another's      
 routine is shunned by the circle.     
   Once people marry, leisure time     
 activities, especially expensive ones,
 are curtailed until families are      
 growing up.  Many women said looking  
 after their families and homes was a  
 full time job and left little time for
 leisure.  Time is spent on D.I.Y.     
 projects in the home, and visits to   
 local pubs or clubs in the evening.   
 Television, fishing and watching      
 football and rugby provide weekend    
 entertainment.  Cost is a big barrier 
 for many people in Wyke who would like
 to try more 'exciting' activities.    </content>
