		<content>   For Sharon, a typical day begins at 
 07.30 when she has breakfast with her 
 two brothers before going to school at
 09.00. She returns home for lunch     
 between 12.00 and 13.00 and attends   
 afternoon school until 15.40.Tea is at
 16.30 followed by some time watching  
 television before bed at 21.00.       
   Spare time may be spent enjoying    
 hobbies. For Wayne this includes      
 shooting, especially clay pigeon      
 shooting at Weathersfield Air Base    
 with Bocking Clay Pigeon Club, and    
 sailing the family's GP14 dingy.      
   Mark was born in Thailand and his   
 neighbour Bill is Vietnamese so their 
 lives have changed dramatically since 
 their arrival in Britain. They spend  
 time watching television in order to  
 help improve their English. Mark is   
 keen on sport and regularly competes  
 as a member of school teams.          </content>
