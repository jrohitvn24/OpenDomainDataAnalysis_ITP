		<title>11NEW RESIDENTS IN QUARRINGTON</title>
		<content> Wednesday 3 April l985 was the day we,
 Hilda and Con Webster, took up        
{residence}in{Quarrington.}For l6 years
 we had lived on Merseyside, the latter
 9 years of this period being spent in 
 a flat. It took three hours to        
 unload our household belongings into a
 modern, 3 bedroomed, detached         
 bungalow, on a small, pleasant,       
{recently developed estate}of 2, 3 and 
 4 bedroomed open plan bungalows.      
 The gardens and properties are well   
 maintained by the residents, who seem 
 to be mainly in the 45 plus age group.
 These people are friendly but not     
 intrusive. {Quarrington}has a church, 
 a farm, a riding school and           
 approximately a dozen other residences
 but there is no shop or public house. 
 As{Sleaford}is only l mile away the   
 absence of a shop in the village      
 causes no inconvenience.              </content>
