		<content> We start the day on Monday by paying  
 our dinner money for the week (Â£3.05) 
 and our{swimming}money, 60pence to go 
 on a coach to Coventry Baths. Each day
 in school includes some writing,      
 maths, topic work, art and craft,     
 music and science activities, singing 
 and stories. This week we have seen a 
 schools' television programme about{  
{Patterns in Maths}and we found how    
 many different ways we could solve    
 problems. Every day we have a{playtime
 in the morning for 15 minutes and then
 after working some more, we have our  
 lunch from 12 noon to 1.15 p.m. Some  
 children have a school meal which is  
 cooked at Knightlow First School and  
 then transported by van to Wolston.   
 Our{favourite meal}is beefburgers,    
 chips and baked beans. Just over half 
 the children bring sandwiches, crisps,
 biscuits and perhaps fruit from home. </content>
