		<content> We spoke to a lady, and her daughter  
 aged 8.She said she would like a sport
 centre, but it would be too expensive 
 to join.The mother said that there was
 no sort of centre where  entertaiment 
 can take place.Apart from a youth club
 which takes place in the village.There
 is not a lot of entertaiment in       
 Poringland.The village hall seems the 
 main point for entertaiment.Every day 
 there is a playgroup for young        
 children.There is entertaiment almost 
 every night from Bingo on Mondays to  
 Girl Guides on Fridays.Every year     
 Poringland First School has a sports  
 day.The events range from dribbling a 
 football to netball.There are plans   
 for a new sports-social centre,to be  
 built on charity land.
