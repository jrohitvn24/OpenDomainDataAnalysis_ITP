		<title>0730 YEARS AT PUTTENHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In{1954,}when{Mrs.Jean Ford}became    
 headmistress of{Puttenham Church of   
{England School,}the building had no   
 electricity and was lit by gas. It had
 three simple classrooms heated by open
 fires and ancient stoves, which made  
 the children cough. Mrs. Ford retires 
 in{December 1985}and Puttenham School 
 is very different.                    
 When a Civil Defence siren was put in 
 the School grounds it brought the gift
 of electricity in 1954.The Marwick    
 Hall, built by village effort,is used 
 daily by the children, as is the      
 recreation field which adjoins the    
 school. There is an annexe for the    
 Headteacher and staff, and a swimming 
 pool and craft room were both built   
 with the help of parents. The latest  
 additions have been electronic - a    
 colour television, video recorder and 
 a B.B.C. computer.                    </content>
