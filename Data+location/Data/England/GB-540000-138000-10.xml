		<content> About fifteen of our school went with 
 ten other schools to Sackville School 
 to give a concert.There were about 200
 children altogether.The festival was  
 conducted by our music teacher.As well
 as singing the children played        
 violins,recorders and flutes and a    
 teacher played an accordion.          
 We had all learned "Captain and His   
 Floating Zoo", "The Keeper", "Singing 
 the Blues" and "The Keeper".Some      
 schools had also prepared pieces of   
 their own to perform. We called       
 ourselves "The Fraying Pockets" and   
 sang "Only You".
