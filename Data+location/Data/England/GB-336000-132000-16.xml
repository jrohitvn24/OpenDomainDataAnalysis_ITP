		<title>16Basket-making</title>
		<content> Basket-making is a local traditional  
 craft, but there is only one family in
 the area which relies on basket-making
 for its income.  The baskets are made 
 from willow twigs known as 'withies'. 
 The twigs are light, springy and more 
 resistant to decay in water than most 
 woods. Three basic colours are        
 possible. A chocolate brown colour is 
 acquired by steaming the twigs while  
 they they have the bark on, white ones
 are produced by removing the bark and 
 a reddish brown tint is achieved by   
 boiling them for a short while before 
 stripping off the bark. Basket-making 
 is a skilled craft and is more than   
 just weaving withies together. However
 it is a declining industry. Many of   
 the products, such as clothes baskets,
 can be bought more cheaply made from  
 plastic.
