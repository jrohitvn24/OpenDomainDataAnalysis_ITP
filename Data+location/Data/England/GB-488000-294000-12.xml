		<title>12 A GRETTON FACTORY</title>
		<content>There is one factory in Gretton,       
owned by a Mr.Tibbert and              
Mr.Woolley. It goes under the name of  
T.W.Electrics and manufactures control 
panels which switch on generators      
should the mains electricity fail.     
The firm started when an Arab          
businessman asked Mr.Tibbert to make a 
control panel for him - which was done 
at home. He was so pleased with it     
that he wanted more. Special premises  
were required, and were found at the   
now disused Gretton Station. Business  
grew, with control panels being        
exported to many parts of  the world,  
mainly to oil producing countries. In  
the late 1970's, a clothing factory in 
the village closed down and the        
premises became vacant. This was ideal 
for Messrs. Tibbert and Woolley and    
they have occupied them ever since.
