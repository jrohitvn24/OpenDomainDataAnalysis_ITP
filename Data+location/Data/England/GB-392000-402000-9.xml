		<title>09BONFIRE NIGHT</title>
		<content>  Most children enjoy Bonfire Night. IT
 is held every year to commemorate the 
 time when{Guy Fawkes}nearly blew up   
 the Houses of Parliament. These       
 celebrations are held all over the    
 country and people build bonfires and 
 set off fireworks. In Oldham we have a
 song called the{cobcoaling}song which 
 we sing. We go round to houses and    
 sing our sopng in the same way that   
 carol singers do and people give us   
 money. The song goes like thos :"{WE  
{COME A COB COALING FOR BONFIRE TIME.  
{YOUR COAL AND YOUR MONEY WE HOPE YOU  
{ENJOY.}"It finishes with :"{IF YOU    
{GIVE US NOWT WE'LL STEAL NOWT AND BID 
{YOU GOOD NIGHT .}"At our bonfire      
 parties we eat special food. We have  
 potato pie,black peas,sticky          
 gingerbread called parkin and treacle 
 toffe. We make a dummy Guy to burn on 
 the fire.                             </content>
