		<title>06COFFINSWELL AND SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content> Coffinswell consists of many fields,  
 with little residential area.The      
 houses that are there are sometimes up
 to 400 yrs old.Many have thatched     
 roofs and are extremely attractive.The
 fields are mostly used as rough       
 grazing land.There are also fields    
 containing non-crops and intensively  
 managed grassland (used for making    
 silage and hay).The animals who are   
 kept in this area include sheep,cows  
 and horses.The roads are very narrow  
 yet are still two-way.As you go along 
 there are hedges on either side of you
 which have to be cut regularly.The    
 hedges contain wild flowers such as   
 Cows Parsley,Honeysuckle,Wild Roses   
 and Campions.These lanes are not      
 smooth as they have a stoney surface. 
 Amenities include 1 public house,1    
 church and Ashlands boarding kennels  
 and cattery.                          </content>
