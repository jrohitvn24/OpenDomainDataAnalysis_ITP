		<content>  Mrs May showed us an old photograph  
 which was taken about 100 years ago   
 The number of people in the photograph
 shows just how busy the village was.  
 Most of the men were farm labourers.  
 Village life centred on the Chapel.   
 Mrs May used to teach in the Sunday   
 School and played the organ until the 
 Chapel was closed in 1971.It is now up
 for sale with planning permission for 
 converting it into holiday            
 accommodation.                        
 Most of the people moved away as      
 machines replaced the farmworkers.The 
 mill became disused and all that      
 remains of it are two old millstones  
 by the farmhouse.                     
 Everyone we spoke to said how peaceful
 it was living in Kestle Mill. The only
 disadvantage was the lack of transport
 and the lack of mains gas.
