		<content>  Frodsham had a busy station, trains  
 went to many places _ busier than     
 today. The other odes of transport    
 were horse and cart and on foot. The  
 area within Frodsham was much more    
 rural, High St., Main St., Church St. 
 and Fluin Lane were the only main     
 roads. Shops were found in Main St.   
 and Church St. these being small      
 businesses _ 3 people in a shop made a
 crowd! Rigby's Dairy and Hanbury's    
 were cinemas, entrance 1 penny!       
 Streets had no electric lights but gas
 lights were lit by a man each evening 
 with a long pole. Local farms were    
 dairy farms producing milk for local  
 consumption. There were more public   
 houses than today. The market was a   
 more prominent feature remaining open 
 until 8pm.
