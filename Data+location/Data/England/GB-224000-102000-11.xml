		<title>11Farming A: Landcover</title>
		<content>  The landcover around Bridgerule is   
 mainly grassland. The soil is clay    
 based and tends to be wet if not      
 drained.                              
  One hundred years ago, one of the    
 main farms of the area was composed of
 three farms and extended to 500 acres.
 It is now 240 acres in area composed  
 of a heavy fertile soil. This required
 a lot of draining in the past which   
 was done with small 2-inch pipes about
 three feet deep and before that stone 
 drains were put in. In the last 15    
 years the whole farm has been drained 
 up to 8ft deep to tape the rising     
 springs.                              
  There is not much marshland in the   
 area but a fair spread of copse and   
 woodland making the landscape         
 interesting and quite beautiful.
