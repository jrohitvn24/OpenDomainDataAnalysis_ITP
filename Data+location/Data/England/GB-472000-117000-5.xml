 THE DEER POPULATION                   
 Fallow &amp; Roe deer are found in this   
 area. Any woodland above 1 hectare    
 normally contains at least 1 pair of  
 Roe. The Fallow deer are rarely seen  
 west of the area. They cannot cross   
 the electrified London-Portsmouth rail
 line. An estimation of the annual cull
 based upon the Forestry Commissions   
 own figures plus local estates &amp; farms
 is 200 Roe, 60 Fallow. A special shed 
 for hanging deer carcases was built at
 Dean Barn. It is EEC regulation size. </content>
