		<content> About 90% of households have a car.   
 Nearly 25% more have two or more.Many 
 older houses have no garage and cars  
 are parked on the road.Telephones and 
 freezers are almost essential and few 
 homes are without.Only two houses were
 recorded without T.V. and by far the  
 majority have colour,with about 30%   
 having more than one receiver.The same
 proportion have video recorders and   
 computers.All recorded had some type  
 of radio or music player.Nearly all   
 had washing machines,usually automatic
 and some form of food mixer.All houses
 in the area have mains electricity and
 all but 8 have mains water.The rest   
 draw water from wells or streams.Most 
 houses in Nanstallon are connected to 
 the main sewer,but the rest have      
 septic tank drainage.
