		<content>    Our records go back to 1935 when a 
 building was on the same site as now  
 but was nearer to the road.It was     
 made of wood,had two rooms and there  
 were about 30 children and 2 teachers 
 It was heated by two coal burning     
 stoves.The age groups were from 5     
 to 14 years.By 1939 the senior boys   
 went to Launceston for their woodwork 
 lessons.There was no water available  
 for washing in the school.Drinking    
 water had to be fetched from some     
 distance.In 1954 the school which had 
 been a mixed all age school,became a  
 Junior Mixed School.Seven boys and    
 five girls were transferred to the    
 Launceston New Modern School.In       
 September school dinners were served  
 for the first time.They were cooked at
 Pennygillam in Launceston.In 1957 a   
 cess pit with concrete walls and iron 
 and concrete cover was built.(Cont.p3)</content>
