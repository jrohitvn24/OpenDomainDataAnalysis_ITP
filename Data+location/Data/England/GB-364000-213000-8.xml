		<content> In their free time Class 6 children   
 do swimming, rollerskating, football, 
 and play in the woods and streets.    
 Some people play on their computers.  
 Paul Luckett's favouite computer game 
 is Jasper. In Jasper you are a little 
 mouse and you must find your way      
 around the screens and try to open    
 the doors of the house by getting a   
 key.                                  
 Other people watch television or play 
 on their bikes or do jobs for their   
 mums and dads. Some people draw and   
 colour. Some play swingball and games 
 in the garden. Swingball is an outdoor
 game. It has a pole and a tennis ball 
 attached to a piece of string which   
 is attached to the pole. If there  are
 two playing one stands either side of 
 the pole and hits the ball with a     
 racket. Helen Barnard plays on her    
 organ.{                               </content>
