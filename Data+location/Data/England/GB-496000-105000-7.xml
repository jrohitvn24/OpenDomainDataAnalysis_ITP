		<content>   The annual week's holiday club for  
 children is run by our two churches.  
 About 40 helpers were directly        
 involved and we registered a record   
 230 children this year!               
   We took the theme of AIRLINES AND   
 FLYING.  The children loved it        
 especially the Fancy Dress parade.  On
 the first morning the children        
 received a "passport" containing a    
 Gospel of St John and a "traveller's  
 chaque" redeemable in the "duty free  
 shop".  During the week by various    
 means this was added to and all bought
 items of their choice.                
   Friday was the highlight when an    
 airhostess came in uniform to serve   
 sundaes and give B.A. presents.  The  
 occasion of the special family service
 at the end of the week again saw St   
 Mary's packed to capacity.  A good    
 week!                                 </content>
