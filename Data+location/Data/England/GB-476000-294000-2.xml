		<title>02HALLATON EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> The working population of Hallaton is 
 very diverse, but it still forms to a 
 large extent a rural community. There 
 are 8 farmers living in the village as
 well as 6 farm workers. The garage    
 owners and their helpers and the pubs 
 provide work within the village, and a
 painter and builder work locally. Some
 people are employed in cleaning and   
 gardening, and there are large numbers
 living and working at Torch House and 
 Hallaton Manor. There are also the    
 commuters and their families - four   
 directors of private companies, three 
 barristers as well as other professio-
 nal people working in Leicester,Market
 Harborough and even London. Hallaton  
 is not the balanced agricultural      
 community it once was: fewer jobs in  
 agriculture and insufficient cheap    
 housing make more young people seek   
 work elsewhere.                       </content>
