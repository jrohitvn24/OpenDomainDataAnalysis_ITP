		<title>10Lydiard Tregoze Church</title>
		<content> Of the churches in the area{St.Mary's 
{Lydiard Tregoze}is the most memorable.
 Dating mostly from the 13th and 15th  
 centuries the{St.John}family added    
 many unusual features. There are      
 monuments to the family including a   
 figure called the{"Golden Cavalier"   
 of Edward St.John who died at the     
 battle of{Newbury}in{1645.}           
 In the sanctuary hangs the unique     
{St,John Triptych,}a large folding     
 painting showing members of the family
 in their 17th century costume, the    
 restoration of this painting having   
 been completed this year.             
{Mediaeval wall paintings}are visible  
 in some parts of the church and 3     
 helmets hang on the chapel walls.     
 The general colourful decoration of   
 the church interior has largely       
 survived due to its isolation, Tregoze
 village having long since vanished .  </content>
