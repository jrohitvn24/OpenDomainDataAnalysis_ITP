		<title>09COMMUNICATION</title>
		<content> Today communication is at a high      
 level, ranging from people talking    
 normally to telephones with screens.  
 Nowadays people can talk to each other
 miles apart and soon you might be able
 to see them on the telephone screens  
 when they come into the shops. No more
 funny phone calls or heavy breathers. 
 Communication is out of this world.   
 With all those satelites British      
 Telecom are making all sorts of       
 gadgets TV phones for example which   
 can be used to communicate with. Most 
 houses have now got phones and TV,    
 these are very common and we take them
 for granted. If you don't have a phone
 you can go outside and use a public   
 one. Public telephones are good for   
 emergencies like when your car has    
 broken down.
