		<content>  This is where the name{"the church of
{our lady"}commences from.Burials at   
 the parish stopped as there was no    
 more room b ut Lord Hastings has his  
 own private grounds by the church for 
 his friends and relatives.            
  The mausoleum in Seaton Sluice was   
 built about the same time as the      
 church.It was just a posh burial tomb 
 which was built for the Delavals
