		<content>   There are several clubs in the area 
 such as the Youth Club,keep-fit,W.I.  
 and roller skating clubs.             
   The Youth club runs on Wednesday but
 there is not much to do there. Keep   
 fit runs on Monday, this is mainly for
 the women. W.I. meet on Tuesday and   
 the roller skating runs on Thursday.  
   Some of the clubs are boring so I   
 dont go to them. At Youth club you can
 mess around, at keep fit you do       
 exercises.At the W.I. they just talk  
 about things, and at roller skating   
 you learn to skate.
