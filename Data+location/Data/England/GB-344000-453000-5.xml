		<content>Today is different from the 1920's in  
the respect that a small estate of     
houses and bungalows has been built on 
land next to the school and overlooking
the yacht basin  within the past 15    
years. Nothing has changed in respect  
of farmhouses,churches,school and      
the two halls in the block - Ellel and 
Thurnham as regards structure.         
Thurnham Hall facade and exterior have 
been renovated and cleaned and much    
money spent internally before it was   
opened to the public in 1975. The      
facade is dressed with stone from      
Lancaster Castle,and this part of the  
house was in a very dangerous condition
and took two years to restore.         
Apart from the erection of grain silos 
on farms,the landscape has remained    
virtually unchanged for centuries.
