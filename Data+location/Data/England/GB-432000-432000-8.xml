		<title>08The Highway Flats- York Road</title>
		<content>    The Highway Flats are in two       
 blocks. Each block is ten floors high 
 and there are six apartments on each  
 floor.   This makes 60 apartments in  
 each block.   Each block has two      
 lifts.  They are mainly for elderly   
 people.   Behind them is good parking 
 spaces and garages.   The ground      
 surrounding the flats has been laid   
 with grass and some flower beds have  
 been planted.   There are benches     
 there for relaxation.                 
    High rise flats are not common in  
 this part of the study area.   The    
 Highway Flats and the Deane - Halton  
 are the only two sites for this type  
 of housing.   The Deane has three high
 rise blocks of 10 storiess, each block
 with 60 apartments.   These were built
 in 1961.
