		<title>13St Annes - Interview Mayor</title>
		<content>     Four third years interviewed the  
 local mayor who thought it a privilege
 to be the Fylde Mayor because of the  
 pleasant surroundings,lovely          
 countryside,the sea and sands and     
 little noise.Although mayor for only  
 just over a month he had already      
 attended over 100 functions.He had met
 people from all over the world in that
 time,the most interesting being a     
 delegation from China.                
     The mayor could not give an       
 outline of a typical day as each one  
 was different,but he was usually up at
 5 AM as he had his own business to run
 and was rarely in bed before midnight.
 Improvements the mayor would like to  
 see in St Annes were to the open air  
 pool and more jobs for school leavers.
 He did not think St Annes would change
 much in 100 years,nor would a mayor   
 ever be unnecessary.                  </content>
