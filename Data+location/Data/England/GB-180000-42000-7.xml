		<content> The service industry sector is growing
 in the area with the establishment of 
 a branch in Truro of the national     
 company English Estates, and the      
 movement of the judicial centre of    
 Cornwall from Bodmin to Truro. The    
 complete range of shops are available,
 from large department stores to small 
 independent shops. In addition there  
 are 8 Banks and 11 Building Societies,
 mostly all centrally based in two     
 streets. There are also shopping      
 markets. There is an Enterprise Board 
 to help form small businesses and this
 has the effect of converting the black
 economy to respectability. There is a 
 Community Employment programme which  
 has helped 1,450 people to gain full  
 long-term employment.
