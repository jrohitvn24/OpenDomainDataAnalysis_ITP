		<content>   Today I feel a quiet contentment as 
 I walk across the lane ,to summer     
 fragrances, under the majestic        
 oaks, which guard my realm. The       
 Honeysuckle and Wildroses drape the   
 hedgerows,pointed with Foxgloves.Their
 colour emphasizing the starkness of   
 the stubbled fields, which gave their 
 harvest to the new barn. This year the
 haymaking has been condensed into one 
 busy week, due to the "daggoldi"      
 weather. Now my husband can supplement
 our income in his building trade. The 
 house stands, within it's walled      
 garden, adjoining the farm            
 buildings, the heart of the holding.  
 In the "Twin Trees" field the sheep   
 graze quietly. With our sheepdog,at   
 heel, I get the corn from the old     
 dairy, to feed the hens,ducks and     
 geese.  {I love this way of life.}
