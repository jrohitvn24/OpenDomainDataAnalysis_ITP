		<title>03The A69 at Haltwhistle.</title>
		<content>    The A69 runs through Haltwhistle.  
 The Main Street is bypassed but the   
 West End is not. A lot of traffic goes
 along the road.  Our class carried out
 a{traffic census}on Thursday 27th June
 1985 from 11am to 11.15am and 152     
 vehicles passed us at the Station     
 Corner.                               
    People who live in the West End of 
 Haltwhistle think there is too much   
 traffic.  In some places the road is  
 only 6.65 metres wide and the big     
 vehicles have to mount the narrow     
 pavement when they want to pass.  It  
 is very dangerous if you are walking  
 on the pathway.                       
    They want a new{bypass}to be built 
 and they have formed an Action        
 Committee to try to make the          
 Government build the by pass at the   
 south side of Haltwhistle instead of  
 widening the present road.            </content>
