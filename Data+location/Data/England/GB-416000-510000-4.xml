		<title>04FORCETT - The Hall Dovecote</title>
		<content>   This dovecote is believed to be of a
 unique  design,  being   hexagonal  in
 shape, built of  stone  under a  slate
 roof  and  with  an  arched doorway in
 each of its  sides  thus  creating the
 impression of its  being supported  on
 pillars.  It is  relatively small  and
 stands in a small grass paddock. It is
 still used by semi-wild pigeons of the
 homing  variety   for   roosting   and
 nesting purposes.  In the past pigeons
 and doves were taken from this cote as
 a  source  of  meat  for  the  kitchen
 table, they also provided sport in the
 form  of  shooting targets  for  local
 gentry. Today, the  pigeons occupy the
 cote  largely  undisturbed  and  their
 place as  live targets  has been taken
 by clay discs, projected by mechanical
 means to simulate a bird in flight and
 which is shot at by  'sportsmen' using
 12-bore  shotguns.                    </content>
