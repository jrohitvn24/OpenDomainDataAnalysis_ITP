		<content> Our fire brigade is{"retained",}which 
 means that it is mainly manned by     
 part-timers. It is called out to an   
 average of{60}fires per year, normally
 inside the village. They are called to
 the station by an{alerter}which makes 
 a bleeping noise; it has a radius of  
 three miles. In the early 1900's they 
 were called out by a hand-siren.      
 The most common fire is a chimney     
 fire, but there was once a fire that  
 lasted nine and a half hours. The     
 firemen get very, very tired at a fire
 and their eyes get sore because of the
 smoke; sometimes they get singes and  
 burns. The men are trained to work    
 as a group and it takes a lot of      
 practice to learn the routine. They   
 carry four hundred gallons of water in
 the fire engine and if that runs out, 
 they pump water out of{hydrants}or use
 open water.                           </content>
