		<title>03Shops in the Aston Area</title>
		<content> We have tried to discover what        
 shopkeepers and customers think of the
 shopping facilities around Aston and  
 Swallownest. Over the past years there
 have been a number of new housing     
 estates built but no more shops have  
 been provided. In this area all the   
 shops are small businesses sometimes  
 owned by families but there is a      
 proposal for a new larger supermarket.
 We have no large department stores.   
 Most shops in this area open from 9am 
 to 5pm and we have a range of shops   
 selling everything from pets to       
 clothes. Most people think that the   
 shops are fairly priced but limited.  
 They would like to see greater variety
 for example: furniture, linens and    
 domestic appliances. People use the   
 shops around Swallownest but now they 
 are going to larger shops outside the 
 area, in the surrounding towns.       </content>
