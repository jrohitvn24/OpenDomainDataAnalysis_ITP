 Mr. Berridge lives at Castle Farm with
his wife and two sons Michael and      
Richard. Mr. Berridge was born in the  
present farm house. He grows mostly oil
seed rape (used for cooking oil and    
margarine), barley (used for beer, gin 
and ale) and the wheat (for biscuits   
and bread). He came to work the farm   
after his father died 10 years ago. At 
the moment the crops are tall and green
and will soon be ready for harvesting. 
After harvesting he will put the corn  
in the barn with big fans that blow    
the corn dry. He has a big pond full   
of trout in the garden in front of the 
house, and when we fed them they       
jumped and dived after the food (small 
brown pellets). He has a special room  
for his fishing gear and on the table  
was the skull of a pike.
