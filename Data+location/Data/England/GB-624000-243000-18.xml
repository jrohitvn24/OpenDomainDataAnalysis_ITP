		<title>18THE L.S.A. POST-WAR YEARS.</title>
		<content>After the war the Ministry of          
Agriculture acquired all the estates   
and appointed the L.S.A. as their agent
for the management of them. All new    
tenants had to have a minimum of 5     
years agricultural experience and to   
find at least a quarter of the working 
capital.Tenants were brought more fully
into consultation both locally and     
nationally.                            
The increased security brought         
increasing effeciency and tenants      
increased their stock and equipment.   
The importance of growing more tomatoes
and lettuces under glass was realised  
and the area under glass increased     
tremendously. The measure of prosperity
continued until the 1970's but then    
the increasing imports of tomatoes and 
salad crops from E.E.C.countries       
brought about a decline in profits and 
finally the demise of the L.S.A.in 1983</content>
