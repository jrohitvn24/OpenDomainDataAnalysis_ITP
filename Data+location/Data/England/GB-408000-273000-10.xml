		<title>10Stratford_on_Avon Canal</title>
		<content> The famous{Josiah Wedgewood }of Stoke_
 on_Trent,instigated the construction  
 of the Stratford Canal.He wanted a    
 cheap and reliable form of transport  
 to carry his pottery. Roads were bumpy
 in the eighteenth century  and his    
 goods were often damaged.He hired     
{James Brindley}to build the network of
 canals known as the {Grand Cross}using
 the rivers Mersey,Severn,Trent and    
 Thames.His goods were then able to be 
 taken from Birmingham to London,      
 Bristol,Liverpool,Manchester and Hull 
 for export.The{Stratford Canal}was    
 started in 1792, it finished at the   
 Wharf Inn, Hockley Heath,this remained
 its terminus for twenty years.It was  
 finally completed in 1816,but in 1823 
 a{Reservoir}was built at Earlswood to 
 improve water supplies.Today,the canal
 is used purely for leisure activities.
