		<title>10FARMING AND WILDLIFE, WARE</title>
		<content> In 1984 farmer Geoff Vigus,chairman of
 the{Farming and Wildlife Organisation,
 put one of his ideas into action. When
 faced with a damp hollow in a restored
 gravel pit, the quarry wanted to drain
 it but instead he made the area into a
{large pond.}Stocking it with fish to  
 make money from anglers, would have   
 discouraged natural plants and animals
 so now it is left for wildlife.       
    Many{new trees}have been planted to
 replace those removed by the quarry.  
 Some trees will provide a wind-break  
 and hide ugly buildings. Small copses 
 will encourage animals and avenues of 
 trees will screen the gravel pits.    
    In the future Mr.Vigus envisages an
{amenity farm}for people to see farming
 demonstrations and enjoy the country- 
 side and wildlife.He has put his plans
 to the owners but doubts whether they 
 will be achieved in his lifetime.     </content>
