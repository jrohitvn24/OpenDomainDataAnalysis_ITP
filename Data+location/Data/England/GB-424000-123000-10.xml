		<content>{1985-approx. 1000 adults}within the   
 parish boundaries.After many years of,
 "strip-development", it is recognised 
 as not being in the best interest of  
 the area.The{SOUTH WILTSHIRE STRUCTURE
{PLAN}has designated W/p.as a village  
 which should grow. Up to 125 new      
 properties will be built between 1975 
 &amp; 1991-some small estates presently   
 being built. Many original village    
 houses bought by ,"newcomers," in the 
 last 20 yrs. The next 20 will probably
 see us mainly populated by retired or 
 commuting families. Because of the    
{lack of support of public transport   
 a completely different method of      
 servicing our community will probably 
 replace the large 'bus companies.
