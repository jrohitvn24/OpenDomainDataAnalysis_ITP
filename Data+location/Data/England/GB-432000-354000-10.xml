		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming in the area is mainly dairy   
 with some beef rearing and a few sheep
 .The dairy herds graze out in summer  
 and are in enclosed yards in winter   
 with a cubicle shed to lie in.They are
 fed on silage.Some concentrates in nut
 form are given at milking time which  
 is morning and night.The two main     
 milking systems are herring_bone and  
 carousel.A herd of 60 to 100 milking  
 cows is average,mostly Fresians.The   
 milk is collected each morning by     
 tanker.The milk is kept cool in a bulk
 milk tank at the farm.A paddle rotates
 in the milk when the temperature      
 rises.The milk goes to the Milk       
 Marketing Board to be processed.      
 Most milk is delivered to the doorstep
 in pint bottles.
