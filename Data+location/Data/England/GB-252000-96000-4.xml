		<content> The majority of the people of working 
 age living in the area are engaged in 
 farm work including contract work for 
 other farmers. Most farms are mixed   
 farms and on more than one there are  
 three generations working. Many of the
 wives of farmers keep poultry, usually
 on free range, and sell the eggs at   
 the house or local markets in         
 Okehampton or Hatherleigh, each about 
 four miles away. In the short summer  
 season there is some work catering for
 tourism, either in offering farmhouse 
 bed and breakfast or self-catering    
 holiday flats but employment is mainly
 within the family. Others must travel 
 to Okehampton or further to find      
 employment other than farming. There  
 is also a transport undertaking in the
 block employing some HGV drivers.
