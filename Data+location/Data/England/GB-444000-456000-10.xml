		<content> Tig Ball.In tig ball you choose a     
 person who is on.He then gets the ball
 and aims the ball at somone.When he   
 has hit somone with the ball they are 
 on.                                   
 Block.When we play Block somone is on 
 at the wall or tree.He counts 100     
 while everyone hides then he says     
 "ready or not".He goes to look for    
 everyone .If he sees any one he runs  
 back to the block and says "Block out"
 and that persons name and 1,2,3 and he
 is on but if he does not get to the   
 block before the person he has to look
 for someone else.When he has found    
 everyone the 1st one found is 'on'.   
 British Bulldog.  Everybody lines up  
 at one side of the playground. The one
 'on' shouts "British Bulldogs charge" 
 and everyone rushes across the        
 playground. The catcher grabs someone 
 who joins him. Last to be caught wins.</content>
