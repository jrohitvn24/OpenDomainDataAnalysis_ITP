		<content>{ Plains Farm School}was first built   
 after the second world war. It was    
 a temporary building which closed down
 and was relaced by the present brick  
 building in 1977. There are two       
 hundred children in the{infant}and    
{juniors}department and sixty children 
 visit the{nursery school}which is in a
 separate building but in the same     
 grounds. Thirty  children attend the  
 nursery school in the morning and     
 another thirty in the afternoon.      
 The School has{two halls,}one used    
 for P E. (The apparatus was laid out  
 when we visited.) Each unit of the    
 building has it's own activity area   
 and library. They have only one       
{football team}and the{Parents'        
{Association}helps with the{Badminton

 large and the school gardens were very
