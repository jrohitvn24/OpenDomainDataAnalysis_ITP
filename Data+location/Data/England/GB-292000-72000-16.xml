		<title>16ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Michael's church is 160 years old,
 but there has been a church on the    
 site since before 1044.               
   The vicar of the church today is the
 Rev. Philip Luff and he is the only   
 full-time worker in the church. He    
 holds nine services every week which  
 included three on Sundays. The church 
 will hold at least 500 people, but the
 congregation added together for the   
 three services on Sundays averages 300
 people.                               
   The choir of the church has about 20
 people including children. Local      
 schools and other organisations take  
 part in several carol concerts that   
 are held at Christmas time and the    
 Flower Festival is a popular event    
 during the summer.                    
   The church costs about Â£20,000 a    
 year to run which includes the cost of
 the heating and lighting.             </content>
