		<content>   Greystones was built as a private   
 house in 1913 for Captain and Mrs.    
 Denison. They owned the land from     
 Montagu Road to the sea and from      
 Waterford Road to Chewton Bunny. Since
 it was built it has had a new roof put
 on. Greystones is now owned by the    
 Highcliffe Community Association on a 
 99 year lease. The estimated cost of  
 restoration and conversion was        
 Â£350,000. In 1984/5 Greystones is a   
 Grade Two listed building but it was  
 empty for nearly 10 years. Children   
 have half-term activities at the      
 centre like drawing, games, making    
 things, reading and dancing. Adults   
 can have meetings, go to exhibitions, 
 have coffee mornings and have their   
 meals on wheels. The meals would be   
 for old people perhaps not able to    
 shop. Many live nearby.
