		<content>   {Constable Burton}lies on the main  
 A684 road.Most of the houses in       
 the village are on the side roads.    
                                       
   One of these roads,leading to the   
 old ford across Constable Burton beck 
 is called{Mill Lane.}The mill,after   
 which the lane is named,is no         
 longer used, but parts of the works   
 are still there,including most of the 
 wheel.                                
                                       
   10 council houses have been built   
 along Mill Lane as well as some       
 garages and a bungalow.The{Methodist  
{Chapel}is opposite the old mill       
 entrance and is still in use.Further  
 on up the road leading to Finghall is 
 a small group of houses for older     
 people called Donald Smith Close.
