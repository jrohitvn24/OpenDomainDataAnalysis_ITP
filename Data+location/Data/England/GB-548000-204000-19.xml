		<title>19St Clements</title>
		<content> St Clements was here before the       
 church. They had a well in the back   
 garden. They had a poltergeist in the 
 front room. The lady said the house is
 in the Domesday book. She said there  
 are graves under the floorboards. She 
 said in, in the house you are never   
 alone and their window was smashed one
 night. They hear sounds at nighttime. 
 The lady was putting her washing out  
 and fell down the well but there is   
 some rock in it now.
