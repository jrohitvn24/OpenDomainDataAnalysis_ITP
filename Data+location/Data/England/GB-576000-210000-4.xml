		<title>04A Day in the Life of Helen</title>
		<content> A typical day starts for me at 7am.   
 I have tea and toast for breakfast    
 then I get dressed in school uniform  
 which is red and white.  The school   
 day usually starts with an assembly   
 in which we are told interesting      
 stories and notices are given out.    
 Our school is an open plan building so
 that children and teachers can work   
 together across the two bases of the  
 same year.  Most of our work is topic 
 work so maths, writing and artwork is 
 all included in it.  We write our work
 in rough work books and when it has   
 been read by the teacher we copy it up
 in best on paper and put it in        
 booklets which we make ourselves.     
 Most of the time we get on with our   
 work independently, so while some     
 children are doing maths others may be
 getting on with writing, artwork,     
 stories, sewing or making booklets.   </content>
