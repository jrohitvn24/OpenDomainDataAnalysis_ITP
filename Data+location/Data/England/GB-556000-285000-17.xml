		<title>17A LITTLEPORT SATURDAY</title>
		<content> This is how Susan Mann, aged 12,      
 described a day in her life.          
                                       
 "On Saturdays, I usually go over to   
 Tescoes in Ely with my mum by car.    
 When I get back I put my pony,{Kojak,}
 on the river bank to eat grass, while 
 I help my mum tidy the house. We have 
 dinner and then I put on my jodhpurs  
 and boots for riding. I pick up the   
 lead rein and get Kojak off the bank, 
 groom him and tack him up. I take him 
 riding, calling on one of my friends, 
 who comes with us for a couple of     
 hours.                                
 When I get back, I feed Kojack and do 
 my homework."                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
