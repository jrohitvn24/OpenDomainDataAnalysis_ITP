		<content> HOME LIFE - THE BOAITT'S              
 MR. Boaitt works in Bristol as a      
 consultant engineer. He travels to    
 work by car or train and is out of the
 house for about 13 hours a day. Mrs.  
 Boaitt used to work in Cheltenham but 
 now that they have 3 children looks   
 after them. When they are old enough  
 they will go to Tibberton Primary     
 School. They will start in the        
 September of the school year in which 
 they are 5. When they are 11 they will
 then go to Newent Comprehensive       
 School. They will be able to walk to  
 the primary school but they will      
 travel by bus to the comprehensive    
 school.There is a play group for the  
 under 5's and Mrs. Boaitts 3 year old 
 twins attend. There is a public bus   
 service through Tibberton but most    
 people travel by car as it is much    
 more convenient.                      </content>
