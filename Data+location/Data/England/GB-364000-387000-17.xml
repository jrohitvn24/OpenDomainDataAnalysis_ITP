		<title>17THE THELWALL SMALL FERRY</title>
		<content> At the end of the 19th century the    
{MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL CO.}cut it's new
 canal through a farm at THELWALL.     
                                       
   The farmer had to have some means of
 transport across to his land on the   
 other side. The company provided him  
 with pontoons to move his cattle to   
 and fro.                              
                                       
   Later a small boat was used to carry
 people across at the same spot.{The   
{penny ferry was born.                 
{                                      
   Today in July 1985 the ferry still  
 operates. It carries a dozen or so    
 passengers at 10 - 15p  per crossing. 
                                       
    The subsidy paid to the ferrryman  
 by the MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL CO. now  
 runs into several thousands of pounds 
 per year.                             </content>
