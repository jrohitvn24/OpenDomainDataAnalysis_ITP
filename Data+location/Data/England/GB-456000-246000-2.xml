 I have lived in England 5 years, pre- 
 viously being brought up in the sub-  
 tropics of Brisbane Australia; such a 
 vast, spacious country compared to the
 quaintness &amp; patchwork countryside    
 with delightful little villages of    
 England.  At first it was the romantic
 sight I had imagined whilst still in  
 Australia.  With the coming of winter 
 reality set in &amp; a great change in my 
 life.  Living indoors &amp; trying to keep
 warm were not things that I had taken 
 into account.  Even sports are played 
 indoors!{(Maybe the Australians will  
{try this, after loosing to us at      
{Cricket in 1985 OUTDOORS - Ed.)}      
 Village life is lovely, I enjoy the   
 many joint functions, fetes etc.  I'm 
 sorry to see more people commuting to 
 work, exploiting ideal village ways &amp; 
 not always lending full support.      </content>
