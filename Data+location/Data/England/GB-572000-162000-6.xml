		<title>06BURHAM - THE NEW SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The old school was situated on        
 Rochester Road next door to the       
 Windmill Inn. It had stood there since
 1858. The village had been promised a 
 new school since 1950. The old school 
 was a Victorian building; the         
 classrooms had very high ceilings with
 rafters, very high church like windows
 that no-one could see through. The    
 walls of the old building were        
 cracking and leaky, the classrooms    
 were cold and draughty. The buildings 
 were spread all over the site which   
 meant going outside when visiting the 
 Head Teacher's room, the hall for     
 assembly, the resources centre, some  
 classrooms and also the toilets. When 
 the school closed it catered for 58   
 children with 2 full time and 3 part  
 time members of staff.
