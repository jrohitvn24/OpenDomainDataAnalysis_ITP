 is very fertile land hence its use as 
 the island's major growing area.  Many
 acres are under glass and there is a  
 flourishing garden centre industr4y.  
 The area is particularly rated for its
 growing of sweetcorn and garlic and is
 being developed as the major garlic   
 centre in the country.                
     There are several buildings of    
 historical value and they are open to 
 view by the public.                   
     Original crafts can be seen at the
 Craft Village and Newchurch pottery

 Public Houses to be visited.          
     A popular camping site is situated
 on the outskirts of Newchurch village_

 the island.
