		<content> On Sunday morning I woke up at nine   
 fifteen. I had my breakfast and then I
 had my hair washed.                   
 At eleven o clock I went to Sunday    
 School, at twelve I came home. I had  
 my dinner and then I got ready for the
 Clayton Frickley Horse Show. At about 
 quarter to two we set off for the     
 Horse Show. When we got there I       
 entered straight away for the potato  
 race, it was quite good fun.          
 After the show we had our tea and     
 then I went out to play with my friend
 Sharon. We played outside for about   
 thirty minutes. At ten past eight I   
 came in for my Supper and watched     
 television, at twenty to ten I went to
 bed. It had been quite an exciting and
 enjoyable day.
