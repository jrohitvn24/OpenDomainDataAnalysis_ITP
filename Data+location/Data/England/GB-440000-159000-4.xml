		<title>04The Holt Vineyard</title>
		<content>{The Holt Vineyard}is owned by         
 Brigadier and Mrs. Turner.It is       
 situated in Woolton Hill and was      
 started in 1977.They decided to grow  
 vines because they had some spare land
 which they wanted to put to good      
 use.The land is suitable for growing  
 vines on because it is stoney,well    
 drained and reflects  the heat from   
 the sun.The vineyard covers 1.2 acres 
 and there are 1430 vines.All the      
 grapes are white except for one sort  
 which is black.They bought the eight  
 types of vines from the Isles of Wight
 and discovered that the most suitable 
 were {Muller_Thurgau,Madeleine        
{Angevire}and{Siagerrbe.}The wine they 
 make is called{Woodhay}and is a dry   
 white wine.
