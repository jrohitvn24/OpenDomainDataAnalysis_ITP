		<title>01A General Outline Of Area</title>
		<content> Our area consists of a fairly flat    
 piece of land with a little undulation
 to the west of Ratby where there is   
 some pleasant woodland.In this area   
 there is the remains of an iron age   
 encampment.                           
   There are five settlements in our   
 area.These are Kirby Muxloe,Ratby,    
 Desford,Newtown Unthank and           
 Botcheston.Of these we have only a    
 section of each.We have most of Kirby 
 Muxloe but unfortunately ,the castle, 
 the focal point of the village,is just
 outside our area.                     
    There is not a great deal of       
 employment in the area but there is   
 aliitle light industry in Ratby.Most  
 people travel to work in Leicester,   
 although the offices of the county    
 council are situated in a nearby      
 village and provide some work for     
 the area.                             </content>
