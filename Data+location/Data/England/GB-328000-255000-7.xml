 Certificate of Secondary Education.   
 'A' level examinations are taken in   
 some of these subjects.               
  Two completely new ideas are being   
 introduced into our school. One is a  
 Technical and Vocational Educational  
 Course for 4th and 5th formers for    
 which pupils have to travel to        
 Hereford for two mornings a week. The 
 other is several new sixth form       
 courses particulary for those not     
 wanting to do 'A' levels including    
 Business Studies and Design and       
 Technology.                           
  There are 34 full-time teachers in   
 the school. There are also 5 music    
 teachers who come in once a week to   
 teach violin, flute, clarinet and     
 'cello.
