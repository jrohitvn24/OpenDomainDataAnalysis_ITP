		<title>19BOLTON WANDERERS F.C.</title>
		<content> Bolton Wanderers Football Club known  
 as the 'Trotters' is situated at      
 Burnden park on Manchester Road. They 
 entered the football league in 1888 in
 Division 1. They play in white shirts 
 and navy shorts.                      
 Bolton have won the F.A. Cup 5 times. 
 1958 was their most successful season 
 because they won the F. A. Cup and the
 Charity Shield and finished 4th in    
 Division 1.                           
 In 1946 disaster struck. Bolton were  
 playing Stoke City and the barrirers  
 collapsed, killing 33 people.         
 Nat Lofthouse, with 33 England caps to
 his credit, an ex-player,ex-manager   
 and now manager of the Executive Club 
 said that the crowds are very low (an 
 average of 5,000 per match) because of
 increasing crowd violence and because 
 the club hasn't much money to buy good
 players.                              </content>
