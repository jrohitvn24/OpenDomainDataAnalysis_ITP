		<title>02NETHER HEYFORD VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>The Village Hall was 25 years old in   
1985. The idea of building a Hall was  
first considered in 1935. By 1956 the  
funds stood at less than 900 pounds but
the estimated cost of building a hall  
was 4000 pounds. At a public meeting   
the idea of using voluntary labour came
up, this gave the committee food for   
thought. It was agreed that this was   
the only answer and so further fund    
raising was undertaken.                
                                       
The Hall was completed at a cost of    
2,900 pounds but the insurance value   
was 4000 pounds. All that and not a    
penny paid in wages! Now built, yards  
of curtains had to be sewn and         
crockery &amp; cutlery bought before it    
could be opened. It was officially     
opened in 1960 by the then Viscount    
Althorp, now the Earl Spencer, Prince  
Charles' father-in-law.                </content>
