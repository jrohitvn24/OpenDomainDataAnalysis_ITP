		<content> Another boring day. Fed up, sitting   
 around, having no money and no work.  
     Five years ago,{British Steel     
 closed and we thought our{redundancy  
{money}would last forever.I had a new  
 Fiat and new furniture and new carpets
 but the car went as money grew short. 
     I did a retraining course as a    
 chef but there is still no work. My   
 wife got a job in one of the new small
 factories, sorting nuts and bolts so  
 I'm left with the housework. I've     
 gardened, watched television, walked  
 for miles, done all the jobs I can to 
 keep myself occupied but now I'm{bored
 with everything. I've got no money for
 a pint or entertainment. There seems  
 to be nothing left.I'll have a walk to
 the{job centre.}Perhaps I'll be lucky 
 and get a place on{a Man Power        
{Services Commission Scheme.
