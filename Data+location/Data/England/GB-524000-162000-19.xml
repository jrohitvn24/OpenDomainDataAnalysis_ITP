		<title>19Northern Cheam, Surrey.</title>
		<content> Northern Cheam used to be an area of  
 fields, hedgerows and farms but now is
 part of the residential suburb of     
 Cheam. The houses, built on London    
 clay, consist mainly of three         
 bedroomed, semi_detached or terraced  
 houses typical of the inter_war       
 period. Most houses have small front  
 gardens and longer rear gardens in    
 various states of cultivation.        
 St.Dunstan's Hill, a busy main road,  
 runs north_south across the area.     
 Northern Cheam is a maze of minor     
 roads but open spaces such as Sutton  
 Football ground and small parks do    
 exist. Services are fairly limited and
 the small number of shops only serve  
 the immediate community: they include 
 a newsagent, a grocer, a DIY store and
 several public houses.It is a pleasant
 area in which to live and the majority
 of houses are occupied by families.   </content>
