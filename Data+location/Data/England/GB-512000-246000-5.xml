		<content> This area has a temperate climate.    
 It is mainly arable farming land with 
 areas of deciduous woodland which form
 important{wildlife habitats,}as do the
 ponds, moats &amp; irrigation reservoirs. 
 Although intensely farmed, there is a 
 wide variety of wildlife including    
 hares, rabbits, foxes, Muntjac deer,  
 game birds, owls, snipe, nightingales,
 tree-creepers and woodpeckers. Bats   
 nest in the Church &amp; great crested    
 newts, moorhens and ducks live on the 
 ponds. To maintain an{ecological      
{balance}trees have been planted to re-
 place casualties of Dutch Elm disease.
 The burning in the fields of unwanted 
 straw is lessening due to{government  
{regulations}and this should reduce    
 possible damage to the environment.   
 Public footpaths giving access to the 
 fields and woodlands are being kept   
 open by the local community.          </content>
