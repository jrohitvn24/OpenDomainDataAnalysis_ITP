		<title>08Glue sniffing in Beverley</title>
		<content> One of the worrying trends in Beverley
 at present is the increase in glue    
 sniffing.  Some young people put glue 
 into plastic bags and then sniff the  
 fumes.  A campaign has been launched  
 to stop glue sniffing.  The Social    
 Services Neighbourhood team           
 manager,Ms.Audrey Orr said that the   
 glue sniffing youngsters who came to  
 her notice were aged about 13 years.  
 As they grew older, they usually grew 
 out of the habit.  A letter has been  
 sent to every shopkeeper who sells    
 glue, telling them to put fake glue on
 their shelves.  If anybody steals it  
 they will find an empty packet.  The  
 shopkeepers will keep the real glue   
 under the counter.  In this way it is 
 hoped that the habit will eventually  
 be cured.
