		<content> The farming in this area is unusual in
 that the actual farms and buildings   
 are contained in the village and each 
 farm has land spread far and wide. No 
 farm has a 'ring fence' within which  
 all its land and buildings are        
 contained.                            
 Generally the size of the farms does  
 not exceed much more than a hundred   
 acres and most of these farms have at 
 least a few acres of arable land for  
 cash crops.                           
 The trend has been for farms to       
 increase in size over the years, and  
 due to mechanisation, fewer and fewer 
 people are employed.  At the moment   
 there are twelve farms in the village 
 of Middlezoy.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
