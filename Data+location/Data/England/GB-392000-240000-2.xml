		<title>02Our village of Eckington.</title>
		<content> Our village is a  Farming community.  
 We are in a {market gardening}area.The
 main features of the village are The {
{River Avon}where the people fish and  
 Bredon Hill to walk up. Ithink        
 villagers come to this village for the
 scenery also people come to enjoy     
{Bredon Hill}and the River Avon. There 
 are also three country pubs in our    
 village.If you walk up Bredon Hill and
 get to the top you get a magnificent  
 view of the Avon valley and the{      
{Malvern Hills}in the distance.You can 
 see the{River Avon}bending and        
 twisting through the villages.I like  
 living here because there are lots of 
 things to do.There is a shop that     
 supplies just about everything ,a     
 playing field with a climbing         
 frame,swings and bars and a Scout hut 
 where Scouts,Guides,Cubs and Brownies 
 hold their meetings.                  </content>
