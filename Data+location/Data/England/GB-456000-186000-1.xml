		<title>01Nurse At Fair Mile</title>
		<content>{The nurse} at Fair Mile Hospital has  
been working there for 2.5 years, and  
likes her work very much. She usually  
spends 37.5 hours a week there and     
feels that she doesn't have sufficient 
pay. She wears a {uniform,} which is a 
light blue dress with a green belt, to 
prevent the spread of infection and to 
protect her own clothes. {Different    
uniforms denote different rank and     
experience.} The {ladies wear yellow,  
green, light blue or navy blue,} whilst
the {men wear grey suits.} She travels 
to work by a hospital mini bus, and has
her meals in the staff canteen. There  
are 40 wards each with 30 beds. These  
patients stay in hospital for a long   
time because they are mentally ill.    
The nurse has to bathe and feed the    
patients and take them for walks. She  
needs to be very patient, spending much
of her time in conversation.           </content>
