		<title>01THE UCKFIELD AREA.</title>
		<content>    Our 12 km square consists of one   
 major town{Uckfield},surrounded by    
 undulating farmland and wooded hills. 
    Uckfield derived from "oaken field"
 has a population of approximately     
 10250 people. By the end of the       
 century it will increase to 15000.    
    Extreme traffic congestion exists  
 on the A22 both in and out of the town
 due to the railway crossing,although  
 the line no longer links Uckfield to  
 the south coast.The new{by-pass}relief
 road will be completed by 1986 and is 
 changing the landscape considerably,  
 cutting through the farms and         
 woodlands.                            
   {The River Uck}and the{Shortbridge  
{Stream}flow into the{River Ouse}that  
 enters the sea at Newhaven. The local 
 area supports many countryside        
 activities.                           
                                       </content>
