  The soft rolling countryside in this 
 area of the greenbelt is mostly arable
 farmland with some mixed woodland.Over
 half the area is privately owned by   
 the Salisbury Estate and access to    
 this for the public is by the main    
 gate to Hatfield House on the A1000 in
 Hatfield. Essendon is a picturesque   
 hilltop village surrounded by open    
 countryside. Many of the buildings are
 listed and during the last hundred    
 years the use of some has changed.    
 St.Mary's church dominates the village
 centre. The main buildings are the    
 shop,the village hall,the school and  
 the two pubs. Other features are the  
 cricket field and the River Lea which 
 lies at the bottom of the hill.       
 Most people work outside the village  
 and many families have lived in the   
 village for several generations.      </content>
