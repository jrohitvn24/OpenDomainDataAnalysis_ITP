		<title>20A family Christmas Day.</title>
		<content> I couldn't wait for Christmas Day,but 
 I suppose we had to!At last it was    
 seven a.m.and Caroline came into my   
 bedroom,then woke Grandma and Grandad.
 We got our pillow cases,(we usually   
 hang up stockings but Mum said we     
 could have pillow cases this year),   
 emptied them and out came chocolate   
 coins,books,magazines and things like 
 that from Father Christmas.These we   
 showed to Mum and Dad.After breakfast 
 the family opened their presents.At   
 lunch-time we had turkey and all the  
 trimmings,then Christmas pudding and  
 brandy sauce.We usually listen to the 
 Queen's speech but,because we had     
 lunch late,we missed it.We watched    
 T.V.and played games,had a buffet tea 
 and watched T.V.again before going to 
 bed.We had a happy Christmas Day.     
    Didn't the day go quickly!
