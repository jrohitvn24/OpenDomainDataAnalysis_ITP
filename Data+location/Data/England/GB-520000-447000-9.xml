		<content> I wake up at about half past seven but
 read for ten more minutes then wash in
 cold water. I put on my uniform and   
 get my things ready. Then my mother   
 makes the breakfast. I have cereal and
 toast.                                
 I leave for school at half past eight.
 When the whistle blows we rush in and 
 hang up our coats.                    
 We have Maths and English during the  
 morning and sometimes Country Dancing.
 We wait for three whistles to tell us 
 it is dinnertime. We are always on    
 last sitting. It might be stew and    
 jelly.                                
 Sometimes I go to recorder lessons. We
 play games like rounders and netball  
 in the afternoon. I walk home through 
 the park with Emma and we go to tennis
 practice at the Secondary School. Then
 I go to Emma's for tea.
