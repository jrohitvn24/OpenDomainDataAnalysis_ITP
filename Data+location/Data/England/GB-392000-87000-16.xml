		<content> Sandford is a small residential area. 
 It is divided by the A351.On one side 
 is a new housing estate and on the    
 other a large council estate and a    
 small Middle Class area.              
 A resident who has lived in Sandford  
 for 31 years said sandford has grown  
 by 150% and could never be a close    
 comunity because of the dividing A351.
 A council house resident thought more 
 playgrounds were needed and as        
 Sandford has grown, the comunity has  
 split further apart.                  
 Sandford has expanded into four main  
 sectors rather than just one as many  
 years ago.                            
 Residents were not always aware of    
 being in a village community;they     
 always thought of Sandford as their   
 own tightly woven community.
