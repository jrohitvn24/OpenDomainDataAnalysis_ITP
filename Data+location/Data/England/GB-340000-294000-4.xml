		<title>04MANOR FARM FISHPOND</title>
		<content>   The old{Fish Pond}at{Ratlinghope}is 
 opposite the Manor House behind the   
 wall that makes the front of the      
 pound.                                
   The pond is 24m long and 10m wide.  
 There is{an island in the middle}which
 leaves a{moat of water}3m wide down   
 each side and 5m wide at the end.It   
 was built like that{to make it easy to
{net}parts of the moat to catch the    
 fish for the people living in the     
 Manor to eat.                         
   The sides of the pond and the island
 are made of stone with soil on top.   
 The moat is still partly filled with  
 soil but it is being cleaned out.     
   We think the pond was dug out of    
{clay}.We know there is clay in        
 Ratlinghope because there was a       
{brickworks}at Brow Farm.
