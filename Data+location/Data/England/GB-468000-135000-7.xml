		<content> Chawton has a cricket club which plays
 on land owned by the Knight family of 
 Chawton House.The pitch, 100 metres E.
 of the school, has a delightful wooden
 pavilion with a thatched roof.Directly
 opposite the school is a public       
 recreation ground set up by the parish
 council in 1979/80. It has a climbing 
 frame, see-saw and swings. The Village
 Hall was built in 1920 and is run by a
 volunteer committee. Dances and       
 parties, mainly for children, are     
 organised. It is used by the Women's  
 Institute for meetings and by the     
 school for concerts. People from the  
 Alton area also use the hall for      
 wedding receptions and other          
 gatherings. There is also a village   
 Horticultural Society which holds an  
 annual summer show.
