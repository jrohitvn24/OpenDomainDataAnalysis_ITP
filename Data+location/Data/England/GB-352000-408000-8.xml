		<content>      A visit to Skull House to inspect
 the discoloured human skull was both  
 interesting and intriguing.  No-one   
 seems to know to whom the skull       
 belonged as it has been at Skull House
 for so long that it seems unlikely the
 past will ever unfold its secret.   It
 is reputed to be the harbinger of     
 misfortune and ill-luck to those who  
 handle it, or remove it from Skull    
 House.  Mrs. Smith, the present       
 occupant, is not particularly         
 superstitious, although she is very   
 reluctant to remove the skull from the
 wooden casket in which it is kept.    
 However, she does admit that in the   
 fifteen years she has lived at Skull  
 House, she hasn't encountered any     
 ghostly happenings yet. The house     
 itself is fascinating, with leaded    
 windows decorated with skulls, massive
 beams and a priest's hole.            </content>
