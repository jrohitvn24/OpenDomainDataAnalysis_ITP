		<content>     In the last census Bratton Fleming
 had a population of 663.              
  The village is on the edge of Exmoor 
 and even within living memory was     
 quite self-contained.Now many trades  
 have disappeared.                     
  Three shops remain                   
 ,Post-office,General store and        
 butcher.The White Hart is the only pub
 of three left in the village.         
  Barnstaple is 8 miles away and it is 
 there that most people go to work and 
 shop.                                 
  The village is essentially linear in 
 shape rising approx. 250'in the course
 of its length.Two new estates branch  
 of this main stem.                    
  The whole area is agricultural mostly
 of a pastoral nature.                 
  Settlement patterns are dispersed    
 either in single farms or 2 or 3 house
 hamlets.                              </content>
