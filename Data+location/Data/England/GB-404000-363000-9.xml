     The house that I did a survey on  
was Bradshaw Farm.  There were three   
dogs and some kaid lambs.  It was all  
soil going to the door.  The owner was 
a local builder.                       
                                       
     Then I went to High Ash Farm.     
They had two dogs.  High Ash is a      
butcher's.  They have a lot of sheep, a
lot of big sheds and they have new     
gates.                                 
                                       
     At Smallshaw they have just put   
up two new sheds and a waggon port.    
They are having 120 horses.  They have 
new gates and they have grazing        
fields.  The road to Smallshaw is very 
rough and bumpy and the stones are out 
of place.
