		<content>  Meetings of Longfield Hill Women's   
 Institute consist of a business       
 section where forthcoming activities  
 and plans are discussed; a break for  
 tea ,cake and chat; finally a Speaker.
 During 1985 there have been talks on  
 Local History by a local resident who 
 is a member of the College of Heralds;
 Life in a Sheltered Housing Complex;  
 slides of a walk from Bees Head to    
 Robin Hood's Bay; a local poet who    
 wrote a poem about the club; a speaker
 from the Wild Life Preservation of    
 Plants; the Orchard Theatre,Dartford; 
 and a talk called "Music is Fun".Every
 year a charity is supported-this year 
 funds are being raised for the new    
 County Headquarters Fund,and clothing 
 has been knitted for the famine       
 victims in Ethiopia.
