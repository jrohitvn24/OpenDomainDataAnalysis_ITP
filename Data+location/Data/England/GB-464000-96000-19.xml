		<content>  The distinctive area of Southsea     
 round{St.Jude's Church}was developed  
 from 1837 to 1862 by an original local
 architect, developer and town         
 planner,{Thomas Ellis Owen}(1804-1862)
 He created a fashionable garden suburb
 in the developing resort of Southsea, 
 close to the old fortified town of    
 Portsmouth.                           
  He laid out Italianate villas and    
 grand Regency terraces in winding high
 walled lanes planted with fine trees. 
 His grandest composition,{Portland    
{Terrace,}to the west of Southsea      
 shopping precinct, has been restored  
 as flats by Portsmouth Housing        
 Association.                          
{ St.Jude's Church}(1851) in Kent Road,
 with its soaring spire, acts as a sea-
 mark for incoming ships to Portsmouth 
 Harbour.It forms the centrepiece of   
 the outstanding Conservation Area.    </content>
