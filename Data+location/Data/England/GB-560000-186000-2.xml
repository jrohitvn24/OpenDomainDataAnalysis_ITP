		<content>   Brown and Tawse are the largest     
 single industry in West Horndon. They 
 are steel stockholders . They buy     
 large quantities from the British     
 Steel Corporation and sell it in small
 amounts.  Brown and Tawse sell        
 stainless steel bars, tubes, fittings 
 valves and plates.  They also sell    
 mild steel.  The difference is        
 that mild steel rusts and stainless   
 steel doesn't, because it  has nickel 
 and chrome added. Brown &amp; Tawse are   
 situated here because there were      
 hangers here,and they had their own   
 railway.  Brown and Tawse employ 150  
 people.  A few come from West Horndon.
 Most come from towns nearby. The firm 
 has 28 lorries delivering and         
 collecting. Other people work in the  
 offices and the factory workers shape 
 and cut the metal to the right sizes.
