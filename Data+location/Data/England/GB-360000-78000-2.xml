		<content> BEFORE THE{SECOND WORLD WAR THE CHURCH
 HAD A{THATCHED ROOF}BUT IT HAS BEEN   
 REPLACED WITH NEW TILES. THE GRASS    
 AROUND{THE CHURCH}IS OFTEN CUT EXCEPT 
 AROUND{THE GRAVE STONES.}THERE IS AN  
 OLD WALL SURROUNDING THE{CHURCH}BUT IT
 IS IN BAD CONDITION. THERE ARE STAINED
 GLASS WINDOWS THAT HAVE GOT BARS TO   
 PROTECT THEM. THE OLD GATE AND PATH   
 ARE STILL THERE AND ARE IN GOOD       
 CONDITION. SADLY THE DOOR OF THE      
{CHURCH}HAS BEEN VANDALISED WITH       
 WRITING AND CARVINGS. INSIDE THE      
{CHURCH THE ALTAR                      
 IS STILL THERE WITH THE CROSS AND     
 CANDLESTICKS AND SOME OF THE PRAYER   
 SEATS HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH BENCHES.
    A LADY COMES TO CHECK AND MAKE THE 
 CHURCH TIDY AND TO LOCK IT UP EVERY   
 NIGHT. A PASSAGE HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE
 CHURCH WHERE{SMUGGLERS LONG AGO HID   
{THEIR CONTRABAND.                     </content>
