		<content> The population has trebled since 1960.
 Three houses were built in{Longlands  
{Drive,}but the builder was stopped and
 permission was given to build{only    
{bungalows. The original plan}was to   
 include shops,a community hall and a  
 play area,but the builder went bank-  
 rupt.Afterwards the Estate was finish-
 ed by{a succession of builders.}Two   
 disadvantages,perhaps,are that there  
 are{no shops}and,in very bad gales    
 overhead cables cause havoc.{26 people
 were interviewed.Of these 2 have lived
 in HB over 50 years,8 had lived there 
 for 10-20 years,and 16 for less than  
 10 years.{Of the 26 ,9 thought HB was 
{peaceful, 6 liked the scenery,2 liked 
{everything about living there,and 8 l-
{iked the sea.Asked about disadvantages
{3 said there were none,9 said no shops
{9 not enough transport,and 4 said it  
{was cold in winter.                   </content>
