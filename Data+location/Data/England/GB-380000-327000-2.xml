		<content> The southwest corner of this part of  
 the heart of England is the{Severn-   
{Trent watershed.}The land rises from  
 85m in the Sow valley southward to    
 151m. There are few sharp changes in  
 slope. The land undulates. Fluvio-    
 glacial drifts lie on Keuper marls and
 sandstones. The fields are not large, 
 and remain hedged. Trees dominate the 
 valley views; they grow in frequent   
 small coverts and in the hedgerows. In
 Eccleshall recent housing estates have
 spread south up from the High Street. 
 Elsewhere are hamlets, isolated cott- 
 ages and farms.{Holy Trinity church,  
{Eccleshall Castle}and parts of some   
 older houses are made of local sand-  
 stone. Little timber frame construct- 
 ion remains visible. Most older houses
 are built of red brick, sometimes     
 patterned with yellow headers. Land-  
 scape is little changed by agriculture</content>
