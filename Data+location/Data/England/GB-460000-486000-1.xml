		<content> This area is typical of the North York
 Moors National park in which it lies. 
 The majority of the area is level,    
 intensively farmed land with a band of
 conferous and mixed woodland running  
 North-South through the centre.  There
 are only 2 small villages, populations
 around 100, neither with any services.
 There are many small farms but all    
 are actively involved with either     
 growing crops or keeping sheep.  Many 
 of the farms are also open to tourists
 in th summer as places to stay.  The  
 woods contain many public footpaths   
 and Riccal Wood in paticular is       
 popular with walkers. Due to its      
 physical nature there are many fine   
 view-points over the surrounding      
 countryside.
