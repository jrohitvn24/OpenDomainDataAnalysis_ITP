		<content>   They are building a better disco, it
 is quite big. They have built an      
 adventure playground for children to  
 play in. We have electricity now but  
 the people in the old days didn't.    
 We have a lot more trees now. We have 
 other good games like{"Guess Who?"}and
{snap}&amp; other games. There are lots of 
 houses here. We have televisions in   
 nearly all the houses and in the      
 school. There is a club up in the     
 church hall on Monday evenings. On    
 Sunday mornings we sing in the church.
   We have computers at home and       
 in school. They used to use the barn  
 as a church, but now they have built  
 a proper one.There used to be a farm  
 here but they have built a school in  
 the same place.Hardly any people had  
 cars in those days but now most people
 have them now.
