		<content> Priors Coppice (833055) is 68 acres of
 ancient coppice woodland split between
 the two Rutland parishes of Brooke and
 Leighfield. The two parts have a      
 different recent history of ownership 
 and management. The western two thirds
 is ash and field maple coppice        
 regenerating naturally after felling  
 with the ash now at 40 ft in height.  
 The eastern third is mature ash and   
 field maple with a stand of wychelm   
 and a scatter of planted hybrid black 
 poplar.The rich ground flora includes 
 herbparis, wood speedwell and yellow  
 archangel.It is one of only two places
 in Leicestershire where the rare large
 slug, characteristic of ancient woods,
 Limax cinereoniger has been found.In  
 1973 the wood was notified by the     
 Nature Conservancy Council as a Site  
 of Special Scientific Interest.
