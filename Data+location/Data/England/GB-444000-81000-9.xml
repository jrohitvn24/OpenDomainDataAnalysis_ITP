		<content> There are 2 Anglican churches in the  
 area; the church in Shorwell is       
 dedicated to St. Peter and dates from 
 1100 AD. It was originally a chapel   
 for Northcourt manor and most of the  
 building dates from the 15th century, 
 with a great deal of 19th century     
 restoration. There is a fine wall     
 painting of St. Christopher dated     
 1440, the same date as the rare       
 medieval pulpit. There are a large    
 number of fine memorial brasses. There
 is a small Anglican church at         
 Kingston; this and Shorwell share a   
 vicar with Brighstone. There is also a
 small red brick Methodist chapel in   
 Shorwell.
