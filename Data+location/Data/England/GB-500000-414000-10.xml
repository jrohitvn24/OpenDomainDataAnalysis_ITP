		<content> school uniform.The girls wear knee    
 length skirts with a blouse or T-shirt
 and a jumper or cardigan.Most boys    
 prefer trousers to shorts and a shirt 
 or jumper.                            
   Whenever we have the chance we try  
 to eat together as a family,but at    
 breakfast we very rarely have the     
 chance to do so.Emily and I go to the 
 local Primary School in Worlaby,so we 
 eat our breakfast together.It's       
 normally beans or egg on toast with a 
 cup of black tea or fruit juice.School
 starts at 8.55 and at 8.45 mum's still
 rushing about making our packup and   
 Emily is still only half dressed.At   
 the last minute I forget my money or  
 trainers and everyones in a panic.When
 Emily's face is still plastered with  
 beans I begin to think we will never  
 be ready.                             
                                       </content>
