 a team in the amateur league of both

 most week-ends in the playing field.  
 For runners there are now two yearly  
 runs. In Spring comes the half        
 Marathon,&amp; later in the Summer, the   
 10Km.                                 
{ For children}there is the Primay     
 school which educates children from 5 
 until they are 11. This offers        
 many activities typical of schools,   
 such as Sports day, Christmas concerts
 &amp; visits to places of interest.       
 Before that there is a play-group,    
 held once a week in the Methodist     
 hall.The park provides swings, slides,
 a tennis court and room for running   
 about. The football pitch is at       
 school. There are flourishing groups  
 of Brownies, Guides Cubs &amp; Scouts.    
 They all meet weekly in the Hut.      </content>
