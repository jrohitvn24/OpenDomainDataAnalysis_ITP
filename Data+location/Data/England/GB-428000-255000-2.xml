		<content> The{Roman Fosse Way}passes close to   
 Moreton Morrell - there is no evidence
 of any settlement from that period.   
 In{Saxon}times there were two villages
 one named Moreton the other Merhull,  
 which means boundary hill.            
 There is an entry for the village of  
 Moreton Morrell in the{Domesday Book  
{of 1086.                              
 Ashorne is believed to have developed 
 as a result of the{"Great Plague"}of  
 the 1660's coming to the village of   
 Newbold Pacey and the people crossing 
 the water of the narrow Woozeley      
 Brook in the hope of escaping death.  
 Evidence of this may be that the      
 village church is at Newbold Pacey.   
 The {Church of the Holy Cross, Moreton
{Morrell,}was a Chantry Chapel to      
 Moreton Hall. The altar dates from the
 1580's. In the churchyard is a Norman 
 gateway.                              </content>
