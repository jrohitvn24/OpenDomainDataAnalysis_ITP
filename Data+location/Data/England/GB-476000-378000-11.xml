		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> The area in the survey region is very 
 rural and is given over to arable     
 farming in the main. Cereal crops are 
 grown as well as sugar beet and peas  
 and beans for animal feed. Local      
 farmers have recently introduced the  
 planting of oil seed rape.The soil in 
 the area is quite fertile as it once  
 formed the flood plain of the River   
 Trent. As it is a flat area, land     
 drainage is an important feature of   
 land management. Numerous dykes       
 criss-cross the fields to eventually  
 drain into the River Trent. The       
 highest point of Rampton Parish is    
 just over a hundred feet above sea    
 level and the lower slopes of this    
 escarpment are on keuper marl. Where  
 the soil is keuper clay, the land is  
 used for fattening cattle.
