		<title>13BELLS AND RINGERS IN WILDEN.</title>
		<content> St. Nicholas Bell Tower contains five 
 bells. Largest weighs 11.5 cwts. All  
 cast in the note F. Oldest bell, cast 
 1460, inscribed with KATERINA ORA PRO 
 NODIS. They're rung every Sunday.     
 Present Captain, Mr.R.W.Ruff, started 
 ringing in 1923. Became Captain 1936. 
 In l981, ballbearings were fitted to  
 bells, costing Â£606.05p paid for      
 solely by the ringers.They have always
 been aware of need to keep bells in   
 good condition. Each Xmas, they go    
 round the village ringing their hand- 
 bells, raising money towards upkeep of
 the tower bells.                      
 Handbells were purchased 1928. Ringers
 gave 6d a week till enough for 12     
 bells. Protected by a statement signed
 by 3 original ringers to remind all   
 future ringers of efforts that went   
 into obtaining the handbells. They    
 must never be disposed of in any way. </content>
