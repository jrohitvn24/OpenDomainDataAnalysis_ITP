		<title>12Whiteparish Church</title>
		<content> A recent survey indicates that{the    
{chancel, once the whole church, dates 
{from Saxon times (c.6AD).The orig.nave
{was Norman (1189AD). Vestry-1969.     
 Since 1984, the church has been       
 floodlit at night. Unusually,{ALL     
{SAINTS'}priest serves only his own    
 parish. About 75 people attend Sunday 
 worship &amp; possibly 150 during the     
 major festivals. In common with a     
 trend since the Second World War,     
 the Communion is again the principal  
 service. Evensong provides an         
 alternate form. A robed choir leads   
 the singing. Weekday services are few.
 The parish priest chimes the bell each
 morning &amp; evening when he goes to say 
 his Office, &amp; pray for the people.    
 Children at{ALL SAINTS' SCHOOL}have   
 services here each term.

 the Vicar, the Reverend Roger Keeley.)</content>
