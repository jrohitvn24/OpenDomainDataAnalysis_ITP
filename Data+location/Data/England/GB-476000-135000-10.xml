		<title>10VISITING A BORDON FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
   We visited Baker's Farm. It had a   
 nursery joined to it and a vet who    
 kept a few sheep. There was rough     
 grazing farmland and intensively      
 managed grassland. At the end of the  
 rough grazing field there was a stream
 about two metres across and a road    
 bridge going over it. The underneath  
 of the bridge was mossy. There was a  
 stone in the water about two foot by  
 one foot. If you jumped on this stone 
 you would not be able to get back up  
 unless you walked through a big bush  
 of nettles.
