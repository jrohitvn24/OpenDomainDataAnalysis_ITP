		<content> Berwick is a private estate of 2,000  
 acres lying 1 mile to the north of    
 Shrewsbury. The house itself is within
 our D-Block. There are 9 farms        
 including the Home Farm and 1         
 small-holding on the estate.          
 The house, originally built in 1731,  
 was restored in 1877. The house is of 
 red brick with typical Georgian       
 windows. It is 3 storeys high. There  
 are many large rooms with fine oak    
 carvings. There are dining rooms, a   
 library, kitchen, billiards room and  
 many bedrooms.                        
  Gardens and farmland surround the    
 house. The Home Farm, next to the     
 house is renowned for its fine herd of
 Jersey cattle.                        
 The chapel is still used for Sunday   
 services. Former employees live in the
 Almshouses.
