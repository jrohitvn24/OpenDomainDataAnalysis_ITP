		<title>11Housing in Barrow Hill</title>
		<content> Barrow Hill is the largest settlement 
 in our D block.The houses are of 4    
 main types.{1.The Blocks.}These are   
 dull brown stone faced buildings built
 before the turn of the century.Each   
 Block used to house 3 families but now
 houses 2 after modernisation.{Railway 
{Terraces.}These were built about 1880 
 and still have arched windows.They    
 were built for railway workers.{3.    
{1930's Council houses.}These reddy    
 brown brick houses looked nice to live
 in and have big gardens.{4. Modern low
{rise council houses.}These were the   
 newest houses, less than ten years    
 old,and were small and compact with   
 tiny gardens and landscaped areas in  
 between.
