		<content> There is a Church of England church in
 Peak Forest which is dedicated to King
 Charles Saint and Martyr.The present  
 building dates from 1877,there was an 
 older church dating back to 1657.The  
 church used to be able to grant       
 special marriage licences and couples 
 used to travel long distances to be   
 married there- sometimes secretly.    
 The vicar is  responsible for a group 
 of four parishes and also sits on the 
 governing bodies of    church schools.
 Services are weekly.Attendance has    
 generally declined this century.      
 There are two Methodist chapels.One is
 in Peak Forest and the other in       
 Sparrowpit which also has regular     
 Sunday School classes. All the        
 churches have fundraising functions to
 raise money for their upkeep.These are
 social occasions in the villages.
