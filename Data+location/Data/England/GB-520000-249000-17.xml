 for{Barbershop}singing. The men formed
 their group in 1978 and six months    
 later ladies began their own group.   
{Shannon Express}was the name chosen by
 the men and Seventh Heaven by the     
 ladies but they soon changed it to    
{Phoenix}when they discovered another  
 group called Seventh Heaven. Both     
 groups are successful and have won    
 awards at the yearly{Barbershop       
{Conventions.}The ladies won a small   
 chorus trophy in 1983 and 1984. The   
 men won a trophy in 1982. In 1984 they
 qualified to sing at York in October  
 1985. In February 1985 they sang on a 
 BBC 1 programme called{Spectrum.}They 
 have also sung on Chiltern Radio and  
 Radio Milton Keynes. They have        
 monthly singouts when they sing to the
 public to raise money and every year  
 they have a{birthday show}for fun.    </content>
