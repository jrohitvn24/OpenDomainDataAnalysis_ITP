		<title>01May Beck Area</title>
		<content> Dominated by open heather moorland in 
 the east and forested in the west.    
 Large conferous plantations and north 
 of these along May Beck valley are    
 quite octensive deciduous woodlands.  
 some farming is mixed arable and      
 grazing between the woods and also    
 rough unenclosed sheep razing.  New   
 plantations are in some moorland.  No 
 villages and there are only 4 farms   
 and a fild study centre so most       
 resident are involved in farming and  
 teaching.  The close proximity of     
 waterfalls, high moors, and forested  
 land make this a popular area with    
 tourists and walkers.  A marked nature
 trail on forestry commission land is  
 aso popular.  The moorland is robably 
 used for grouse shooting.  The main   
 A17 road passes through the area but  
 there are no amenities in this scenic 
 National Park block.                  </content>
