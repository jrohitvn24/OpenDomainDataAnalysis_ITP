		<title>11HEADMASTER:FOUR MARKS SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Mr Sykes - our Headmaster.            
                                       
 Mr Sykes runs a school of 244 children
 and 9 teachers and 15 other staff.  He
 teaches as well.  He likes sport and  
 is in these teams:-  Hockey,          
 Badminton, Tennis and Squash.  He said
 if he could give the school 5 things  
 they would be:  2 teachers, a new     
 building, a new library, a resource   
 centre and a better music room.       
                                       
 Mr Sykes would like to go on trips    
 with the school and loves drama.  He  
 has no favourite child in the school.
