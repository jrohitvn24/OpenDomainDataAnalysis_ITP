		<title>12THE SEVERN BORE</title>
		<content>  The event which brings most outsiders
 to Minsterworth is the Severn Bore.   
 The Bore is a small tidal wave which  
 travels up the River Severn. It is    
 caused by a high tide in the Severn   
 Estuary: as the water is drawn up the 
 estuary into the narrowing river, the 
 water forms into a tidal wave which   
 can be as much as 6 feet high. The    
 bore travels upriver at about 10 mph. 
 Although the bore can travel past     
 Gloucester as far as Tewkesbury, the  
 best places to see it are below       
 Gloucester, especially at Minsterworth
 where there is a footpath alongside   
 the river. If there is a big bore     
 during the day at a weekend, then     
 there is often a large crowd to watch 
 it. It can be difficult to find       
 anywhere to park a car!
