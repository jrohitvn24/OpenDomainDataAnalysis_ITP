		<content>     In{East Ogwell}where we live there
 are lots of houses being built.We     
 have got a{Post Office}which is also  
 a village shop.                       
     Down in Sunny Hollow a lady called
 Mrs Saunders lets us in her swimming  
 pool.At the end of the summer we will 
 buy her a box of chocolates.          
     Some times when it is hot we go   
 and play tennis on the village tennis 
 court.You only have to pay 50p if you 
 are a member.                         
     Up on the green there is a death  
 swing, where we go and play sometimes.
 It is great fun.                      
     Outside the village there is a    
 cattery where they keep cats for      
 people who are on holiday. The cats   
 are looked after very well.{
