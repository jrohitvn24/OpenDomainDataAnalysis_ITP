		<content> The Saxon Church in East Lexham is a  
 major feature of the area's{local     
{history.}It has possibly the oldest   
 Church Tower in England and because of
 this has become an attraction for     
{tourism.}It used to be the centre of a
 Saxon village traces of which can     
 still be found in the woods nearby.   
 The Church itself is a small building 
 with an interior length of            
 approximately 18 metres.The inside of 
 the{building}is extremely well cared  
 for and is a good facilty in which to 
 practice{religion.}Extensive          
 rebuilding                            
 has been carried out.An example of    
 this is the wall surrounding the      
 churchyard which has been rebuilt by  
 the present Lord of the Manor.{
