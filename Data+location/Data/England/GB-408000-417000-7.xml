 shops.The Brook shop sells sweets and 
 food.A second hand shop sells         
 electrical things and a general food  
 store sells food.This is like a       
 supermarket such as Tesco or Asda.    
 Next to this there is a hairdressers  
 which I go to.                        
  Slightly up the road there is a post 
 office and a fish and chip shop. Soon 
 there will be a cafe. Further up the  
 road is Parkers which is a shop run by
 Frank and Sandra Wade. There is also a
 shop called Peckets which is a        
 newsagents and sells cigarettes,
