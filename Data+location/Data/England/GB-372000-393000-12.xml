		<content> On Saturday I get up at seven o'clock,
 get dressed and have my breakfast. I  
 call for Darren at two 0'clock and we 
 get the bus to the George H. Carnell  
 Centre. It is fourty pence to get in. 
 At half past two it starts and we play
 football until three. Our team usually
 wins.Then we go on the bouncy castle. 
 They let the babies on first, then the
 fours and fives and then anyone. We   
 play squash then, which I usually win.
  When we go for lunch at the cafe     
 inside the centre we have sausage on a
 balm cake. We then maybe go to the    
 exersize room. We like to go to the   
 movie room to watch some cartoons. My 
 favourites are Mickey and Donald. We  
 enjoy watching the swimmers in the    
 pool who jump in and dive from the    
 board.
