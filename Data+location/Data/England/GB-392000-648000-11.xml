 prior to its being broken up formed   
 the largest part of th district under 
 review.Consisting of approximately    
 3200 acres it belonged at one time to 
 a family named Orde who lived in or in
 the vicinity of Horncliffe.The        
 property then changed into the hands  
 of the Liddle family,a  daughter named
 Annie married a wealthy gentleman by  
 the name of Mather,on his death she   
 married  Hubert Jerningingham in 1874.

 that this money was used to build the 
 Mansion House of Longridge Towers     
 1878.The building was very            
 elaborate,built of cold grey stone    
  with arched front entrance and a     
 high tower,and the grounds were set   
 out with grass terraces,beautiful tree</content>
