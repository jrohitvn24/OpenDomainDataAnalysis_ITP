 The village of Churt is a quiet place 
 with a few quiet lanes,and one big    
 wider road.There is a hotel called The
 Pride of the Valley where you can stay
 overnight,or go for lunch or dinner.By
 the side of it is a road called Jumps 
 Road;along the road are three hills   
 they are called The Devil's Jumps     
 because they are close together,like  
 jumping.The hills are made of         
 sandstone,and there is a lot of       
 bracken and heather.From the top you  
 can see Farnham and Frensham Little   
 Pond down below.If you stand on the   
 Jumps and look down at the Flashes,it 
 looks like a puddle.The Flashes is a  
 pond,a small pond,at Rushmoor;it is   
 nice to paddle in and give your dogs a
 swim.It has woodland around it.
