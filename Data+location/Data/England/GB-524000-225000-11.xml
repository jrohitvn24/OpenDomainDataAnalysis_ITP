		<title>11E.M.Forster In Stevenage.</title>
		<content>{Rooks Nest House}on  the outskirts of 
 Stevenage became{"Howards End"}in the 
 novel by{E.M.Forster},who lived there 
 as a boy from 1883 to 1893.{Elizabeth 
{Posten}a composer,who lives there now,
 keeps it much as it was then,with the 
 coal fireplaces and the old lantern.  
 In the{kitchen}there is a row of bells
 on the wall,one for each room in the  
 house,so when one rang,the{servant    
 knew where to find Mrs.Forster. When  
 E.M.Forster lived there,the house had 
 no running water,gas or electricity,  
 but he thought it was a lovely place  
 to live.He had some memorable times   
 walking in the fields,walking to{Ches-
{field Park},riding his pony;playing in
 the chalkpits or at{Rooks Nest Farm.  
 Many years later,his protests helped  
 to save some of the countryside north 
 of Stevenage ,now called{"Forster     
{Country",}from the New Town planners. </content>
