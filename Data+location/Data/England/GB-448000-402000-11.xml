  The biggest village fund-raising     
 event is the Summer Carnival, which   
 has been held every year since it was 
 started in 1971 to raise funds for the
 building of the hall.                 
    In Barnburgh and Harlington we have
 three pubs and a club. The pubs are   
 called "The Harlington Inn","The Crown
 Inn"and "The Coach and Horses" which  
 was opened in 1937.A fishing permit   
 for Barnburgh Pond can be obtained at 
 the club. The pond has very good      
 coarse fishing facilities, and is     
 situated close to the old village,but 
 is nestled amongst trees and          
 surrounded by gently sloping          
 fields.The fish to be caught is perch,
 tench,roach and carp.Maggots for      
 fishing can be obtained from a local  
 Maggot Farm, situated just outside the
 village.                              </content>
