		<content> There have been some minor property   
 developments over the past 20         
 years,the largest being the           
 "new"estate of{Chestnut Road}.This    
 is a group of 50 houses built         
 around 1960 to re-house the           
 families,moving jobs from Birmingham  
 to Banbury,with Birds Custard Ltd,now 
 General Foods Ltd.                    
 Interestingly,considerable relaxation 
 of planning permission was            
 allowed and the Green Belt            
 conservation rules relaxed in         
 order to bring prosperity to the      
 area.Non of the properties are built  
 in local stone but a light clay brick 
 with timber cladding.This has reduced 
 the average house price and enabled   
 younger first time buyers,to come into
 the village,giving it new blood and   
 keeping the local school alive.
