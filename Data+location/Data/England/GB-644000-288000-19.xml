In our village school 34 children live 
in detatched houses, 17 in             
semi-detatched houses and 2 in terraced
houses. Only 4 children lived in       
detatched bungalows and 1 lived in a   
semi-detatched bungalow.               
                                       
Out of 63 houses surveyed in the       
village of Barnby 32 had single        
garages for their cars and 13 had      
garages for two cars.                  
All of the houses had bathrooms,9      
of them had two bathrooms and 41       
houses had showers.
