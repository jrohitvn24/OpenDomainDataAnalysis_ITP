 This airport is a unique feature on   
 the outskirts of the city of          
 Cambridge.It is privately owned by the
 Marshall Group. The grid position is  
 05480258.                             
 In 1938 the present airfield was      
 opened and such was the enthusiasm of 
 Mr. D.G.Marshall, who started it all, 
 that he offered the facilities to all 
 aircraft that wished to use them. This
 still holds good today. "Marshalls"   
 are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a  
 day. A Flying Club operates from the  
 airfield and private planes are housed
 and serviced there.                   
 Marshalls are renowned, world wide,   
 for their expertise in the            
 modification of aircraft,especially   
 their connection with the Hercules    
 transport planes.
