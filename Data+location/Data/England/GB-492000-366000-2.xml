		<content> The area is generally used for        
 residential,farming and extractive    
 industrial purposes.                  
  There are eight schools in the area  
 which means there are alot of         
 children,although the number of school
 age children has dropped over the last
 few years.                            
  Housing covers half the area         
 surveyed. There is a lot of inland    
 water which attracts fishermen and    
 sailing clubs.                        
  There are five gravel pits in the    
 area,some within two square kilometres
 of each other.                        
  The town has grown rapidly over the  
 last 25 years,during which time most  
 of the housing,shops and schools have 
 been built,changing a small village   
 into a large town.
