		<title>05FARMING TODAY.</title>
		<content> By far the major industry is farming.A
 great deal of farmland is now arable  
 and worked by huge machines and held  
 on a co-operative share/profit scheme.
 Only about one quarter of the farms in
 the area are now farmed by the owners.
 There is not a great deal of pasture  
 for the animals and grazing left,and  
 what there is is mostly for sheep.Just
 lately "milking" has been unprofitable
 and so heds of milking cows have been 
 sold.There is certainly the look of   
 prosperity and fertility about the    
 farms in south Warwickshire,and       
 clearly good yields are harvested.Pig 
 farming is dying out inthe area and of
 course there are no longer "cottage   
 pigs",so long the dietary standby in  
 the villages,when everyone who could  
 kept one.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
