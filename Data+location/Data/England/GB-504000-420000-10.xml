		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ROBERT1</title>
		<content> On Saturday 11th May 1985 I watched   
 "Street Hawk"on my Video.Then I had my
 breakfast, got dressed and tidied my  
 room. At 10 o'clock I asked my dad if 
 I could cut the lawns and he agreed.  
 I got the mower out of the shed but   
 while I was cutting the grass one of  
 my friends called (Wayne) came to see 
 if I was playing so he helped me to   
 finish and then we went to his house  
 and played on his BMX cycle. At about 
 1 o'clock mum,dad,Emma and myself went
 to Grimsby to do some ice skating.    
 After we had been skating for an hour 
 we went shopping. I bought a pocket   
 torch and mum and dad bought a        
 joystick and discs for our computer.  
 When we returned home I went out on my
 bike for half_an_hour before tea.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
