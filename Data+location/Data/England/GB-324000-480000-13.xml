		<title>13OUR OWN DOMESDAY SURVEY</title>
		<content>   As part of our work on the Domesday 
 Project we sent out 250 questionaires 
 to families living in our survey area 
 of Croftlands and Bardsea.            
   The questionaire covered four main  
 topics. These were:                   
   1.Bus services                      
   2.Shopping                          
   3.Leisure activities                
   4.Religion.                         
   176 questionaires were returned and 
 the results follow here and on the    
 next three pages.

 1.BUS SERVICES                        
   There are fairly good bus services  
 between Barrow and Ulverston which    
 also serve Bardsea and Croftlands.    
 46% of the people in our sample never 
 use the bus service,26% use it weekly 
 20% use it monthly and only 8% use the
 bus every day.                        </content>
