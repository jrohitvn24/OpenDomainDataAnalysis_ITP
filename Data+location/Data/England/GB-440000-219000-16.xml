		<title>16Wootton Weather June 1985</title>
		<content>At Wootton Primary School the children 
take weather recordings each day.This  
includes taking the maximum and minimum
temperatures as well as the soil       
temperature.Using an instrument called 
a ventimeter,the children record the   
force,speed and direction of the wind. 
The children also record cloud cover as
well as a general description of a     
particular day's weather.              
During the recording of the Domesday   
Survey,in June 1985,the weather has    
been particularly bad.It has been the  
wettest June for over 25 years.The     
temperature has barely risen above 14  
degrees centigrade.It has been cold,wet
and miserable.
