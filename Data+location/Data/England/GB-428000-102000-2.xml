		<title>02Day Visitors to the Forest</title>
		<content>  A survey was conducted to find out   
 how many people visit the forest on an
 average summer Sunday. It was based on
 the numbers of vehicles parked in     
 official car parks.                   
 It was found that by 12:00 {2000}     
 vehicles were parked but by 13:30 that
 number had reduced to{1500.}However   
 by 15:00 the cars had increased to {  
{4600.}From that time the vehicle      
 numbers gradually declined until by   
 21:00 most car parks were virtually   
 empty.                                
 If one assumes 2 occupants per vehicle
 it can be estimated that the          
 population of our area increases by   
 some {9000}people at the weekend.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
