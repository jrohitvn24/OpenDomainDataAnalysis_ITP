		<title>16VILLAGE LIFE: Mr. Read</title>
		<content>   Mr Read has lived in Tottington     
 nearly all his life.He is 93.He went  
 to St Anne's school.They had to pay a 
 fee of 1d (1 penny!).Boys wore a pair 
 of clogs, shorts and a shirt.         
   Children got presents for christmas,
 Easter, and Whitsun.At easter you only
 got a hard boiled egg.At Christmas you
 got a handful of sweets and nuts and  
 perhaps a ball or a doll.             
   At Whitsun everybody tried to get   
 new clothes for Whit walks.Pocket     
 money was 1d which would buy a dozen  
 marbles or a Frys cream bar.          
   Mr Read's old house had no          
 electricity, no gas or water, but     
 there was a well 150 yards across a   
 field.                                
   At home he had a special carpet     
 which he rolled out on a Sunday and   
 rolled back up again on a Sunday.
