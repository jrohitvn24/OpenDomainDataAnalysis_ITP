		<title>07Home Life in Sydling</title>
		<content> For the working population of Sydling 
 home life starts early in the morning.
 People who have jobs have long        
 journeys to make to their place of    
 work.  Children have to catch the     
 School bus which leaves Cross Tree at 
 about 8 am.  For the rest who work in 
 the village, the builders, decorators,
 plumbers, electricians, cleaners,     
 hairdressers and the farmers, most of 
 them make early starts.               
 This leaves the elderly and the       
 recently retired population to get up 
 in their own time.  The Post Office   
 opens from nine until 5pm with an hour
 off for lunch, 3 days a week.         
 The  Greyhound Pub opens from 11.30am 
 until 2.30pm and from 6.30pm until    
 10.30pm each evening.  They serve food
 and have limited accomodation for     
 guests.                               
                                       </content>
