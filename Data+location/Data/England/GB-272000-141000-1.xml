		<title>01LAND USE</title>
		<content>     This land is almost entirely      
 composed of moorland.This is too boggy
 for grazing animals, and enclosed     
 fields are used to contain them. There
 are many streams and these are        
 surrounded by marshland.The soil is   
 sponge like and this holds            
 water, other mosses and grasses have  
 grown over the top and these are      
 dangerous.                            
     The highest point on the map is on
 the Chains, highest point 1599 ft.    
 above sea level.The Chains are very   
 boggy, and its many streams form into 
 rivers. The main rivers are the       
 Barle, West Lyn, Hoar Oak and the Exe.
     There is a complete lack of       
 settlement in the Chains and only two 
 desolate farms exist in this area.One 
 is now  deserted the other is an      
 exploration centre.
