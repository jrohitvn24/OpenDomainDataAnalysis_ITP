		<content> THE DONKEY DERBY                      
  The Donkey Derby is a fete with a    
 difference.There are all the stalls   
 and rides that are at all fetes but   
 the main point of this fete is the    
 donkey races.The donkeys have only a  
 bridle and they are not broken in.At  
 the start,each jockey has to vault on 
 and then try to make his donkey finish
 1st,2nd or 3rd.The jockeys in the     
 first three places get points as well 
 as rosettes.At the end of the day,as a
 last race,the eight jockeys with the  
 most points have a race to see who is 
 champion jockey and that jockey gets a
 "champion" rosette and a cup.People   
 bet on the races and the whole derby  
 is sponsored by the Round Table.
