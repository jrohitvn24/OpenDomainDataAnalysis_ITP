		<content> Biggleswade has had a brewery since   
 1764, with major rebuilding being     
 carried out in 1901 and the 1970s.    
 During this time, more than 200 years,
 several changes of ownership and      
 amalgamations have taken place, and   
 the current proprietors are Messrs.   
 Greene King.                          
 The brewery supplies 330 local public 
 houses, and is the centre of Greene   
 King's operations in seven surrounding
 counties. At present there are 230    
 employees.                            
 The best known product of the brewery 
 is Abbot ale, and its fame has spread 
 to national level.
