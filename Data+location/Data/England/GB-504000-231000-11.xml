		<title>11HILLFOOT FARM</title>
		<content> The farm is about 540 acres.It is     
 owned by Mr.Derek Harris who grows    
 wheat,barley,peas and grass.He doesn't
 keep any animals.                     
  He has many machines, a lot of       
 tractors,some are crawlers and one is 
 a special narrow-tyred tractor that   
 won't crush the corn as it travels.   
  He bought a new combine harvester    
 this year for Â£48,000.                
  Mr.Harris has only his son Stephen to
 help him on the farm.His busiest time 
 is from mid-July to mid-October when  
 he is harvesting.                     
  When we asked him what he liked about
 the farm he said it was the open-air  
 life and the freedom of being his own 
 boss and seeing the results of his    
 work. He especially likes harvesting  
 the crops after all the labour of the 
 year's work.                          
                                       </content>
