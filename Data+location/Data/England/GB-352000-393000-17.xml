		<title>17ENTERTAINMENT IN PARR.</title>
		<content>      We  organized a survey around a  
 local  area,  called  Fingerpost  to  
 enquire about  local  entertainment.  
 A poll of  thirty  people were asked  
 each of these five questions:-        
 1."What  do you do for entertainment  
 in the  evenings?". Sixteen  watched  
 television,  fourteen took  part  in  
 'Pub Sports'.                         
 2."Do you visit the St.Helens Show?"  
 (An  annual  3  day  event  in July)  
 Fifteen did fifteen did not.          
 3."Is there enough entertainment for  
 adults in the area?" Eleven said yes, 
 eighteen said no, one did not know.   
 4." Do you ever go to watch St.Helens 
 RLFC?". Twenty four said no, only six 
 attended.                             
 5."Do  you  think  there  is  enough  
 entertainment  for  children?".  One  
 said yes and twenty nine said no.
