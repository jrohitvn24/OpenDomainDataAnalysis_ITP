		<title>11THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content>  This was built in 1822 by voluntary  
 subscription.It was handed over to    
 Durham County Council for a school.In 
 1964 a new school was built by the    
 D.C.C. and the Hall was then altered  
 and extended for use as a community   
 centre.Today it is administered by an 
 elected committee,made up of members  
 of groups or individuals belonging to 
 The Village Hall Association.         
   The Hall is available for rent and  
 is used weekly by the Youth Club and  
 the Whist Drive Group.Monthly meetings
 are held by the Women's Institute and 
 the Parish Council Meetings of both   
 Hamsterley Parish and South Bedburn   
 Parish.The local Playgroup meets twice
 weekly.The Village Hall Association   
 runs its own functions too,such as    
 dances,suppers and entertainments.It  
 is also let to outside organisations  
 to run functions or to camp in.       </content>
