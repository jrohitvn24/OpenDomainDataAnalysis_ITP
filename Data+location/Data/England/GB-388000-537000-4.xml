    Our class visited the mart at the  
 end of April and it was quite busy.   
 The mart is near the village green,   
 and this was covered with parked cars,
 landrovers and cattle wagons. There   
 were also lots of vehicles parked on  
 the grass verge along the main road   
 leading to Daddry Shield.             
                                       
    The mart is a large building made  
 of corrugated steel and wood. It is   
 surrounded on the outside by pens for 
 the cattle and sheep to stand in      
 before they are sold. At the back of  
 the mart building is a small office   
 where the farmers pay for the stock   
 that they have bought.                
                                       
    All the cows and sheep had numbers 
 stuck on their backs so that the      
 auctioneer knows who they belong to.  </content>
