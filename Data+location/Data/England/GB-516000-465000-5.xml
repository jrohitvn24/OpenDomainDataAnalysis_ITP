		<title>05The Sea Front Bridlington</title>
		<content> Bridlington's sea front is a mixture. 
 Much of the promenade parallel with   
 the beach to the north of the harbour 
 is lined with 3 &amp; 4 storey hotels,    
 flats &amp; boarding houses dating from   
 the Victorian and Edwardian periods.  
    One of the main features of th     
 front south of the harbour is the Spa 
 theatre, the venue for films, shows   
 and seasonal entertainment. There is  
 also a floral pavilion, used for organ
 recitals in summer. A variety of      
 amenities including crazy golf, an    
 astroslide, dodgems and other rides   
 are close by.                         
    Bridlington's swimming pool is     
 being incorporated into a new leisure 
 complex due to open in 1987. Much of  
 the promenade to the north has        
 landscaped gardens between the road   
 and the sea front. There are several  
 amusement arcades near the harbour.   </content>
