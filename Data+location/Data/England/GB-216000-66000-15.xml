		<title>15TOURISM CARNGLAZE CAVERNS</title>
		<content> Just out of the village is the tourist
 attraction of the Carnglaze slate     
 caverns.There, two large caverns have 
 been cut into the hillside,one at a   
 higher level than the other.Many of   
 the old buildings in St Neot were     
 built from slate from these           
 caverns.The underground quarries are  
 now open to the public and are        
 artificially lit.The larger, lower    
 cavern has two pools of water which   
 are unexpectedly clear.During World   
 War                                   
 Two the abandoned slate quarries of St
 Neot were used to store the spare     
 supplies of naval rum.
