		<content> The most important road at Brownhill  
 is Whalley New Road. A traffic count  
 showed ninety-one cars, three vans,   
 seven motorbikes one lorry and two    
 buses in five minutes.                
 The shops are always full of people.  
 The grocer's, co-op and paper-shop are
 the busiest. The co-op is a big store 
 that sells and hires out videos, video
 tapes and televisions. It also        
 sells packed meats, frozen food,      
 canned food, vegetables, household    
 products and fruit. It is like a      
 supermarket. Another busy shop is the 
 fish and chip shop. Open five days a  
 week it is an excellent quick food    
 shop. It sells pies, puddings, peas,  
 as well as fish and chips, of course. 
 It also sells 'pop' (carbonated water)
 but the Newsagent does best with that.
