		<content>The inhabitants of Deene &amp; Deenethorpe 
have traditionally been employed by the
Brudenell family, on the Deene Park    
Estate, but in recent years the number 
of estate workers has decreased.       
Some former employees now live in      
retirement in the villages, but most of
the inhabitants are still associated   
with the Estate.                       
It does, however, appear that many of  
the younger generation have moved away 
from the area to seek work elsewhere.  
Such a move gained momentum in the     
1930's, when the steelworks opened at  
nearby Corby....and workers sought the 
earnings being offered in industry.    
Today, the majority of local workers   
are employed at Deene Park,with a small
workforce on the farms. The only people
working outside the locality seemed to 
be four women, who had found work in   
the Corby area.                        </content>
