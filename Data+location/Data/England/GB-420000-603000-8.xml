 Dairy farming is the main feature of  
 Morwick Farm.There are 92 pedigree    
 Ayrshire cows in milk,producing almost
 2,160 gallons of milk daily.This is   
 collected by tanker and sold locally  
 to Eshott Farms who have their own    
 bottling plant.The milking parlour is 
 based on a "herring-bone" design which
 enables one dairyman to supervise the 
 milking operation.During milking the  
 cows are fed cattle cake.A computer   
 controls the amount of food each cow  
 receives.In winter the cows are kept  
 in a large shed and fed silage and    
 barley mixed with molasses and        
 minerals. When a cow goes "dry" she is
 put into calf again. The young calf is
 taken away from it's mother and reared
 on dried milk.
