		<title>16WHERE I LIVE IN TIBSHELF</title>
		<content> I live on a small estate called Spa   
 Croft. It is near my school and near  
 the recreation ground. It is a three- 
 bedroomed semi-detached with a garage 
 and two sheds. Why we need two sheds I
 don't know. There is a bigger estate  
 nearby where I sometimes go to play   
 with my friends.                      
 When we go shopping we go to one of   
 the main towns nearby, like Alfreton, 
 Chesterfield or Sutton-in-Ashfield.   
 There is also some attractive country-
 side nearby, like Ashover where we    
 sometimes go for a picnic.            
 I like shooting but there are no      
 places where I can practise except my 
 back yard. I also like cycling. I keep
 my bike in one of the sheds. It is a  
 red 10-speed Peugeot racer. I have    
 just passed my cycling proficiency    
 test at school.
