		<title>03Gradient Test</title>
		<content>  All vehicles at the Ministry of      
 Defence are tested on gradients to see
 if they are able to stop and restart  
 on them.                              
  4 slopes are used in this            
 test:1:2;1:2.5;1:4 and 1:5.All the    
 slopes are tarmaced with the exception
 of the 1 in 2 slope which is grassed  
 and only used  for tracked vehicles.  
 On our visit Ministry of Defence we   
 watched a fork lift JCB drive up a 1:4
 slope.It successfully went up         
 on the first test but on the second   
 test,which involved stopping and      
 restarting on the slope,there was much
 wheel spinning and we smelt burning   
 rubber.However after about 20 seconds 
 it managed to go up the hill.The      
 reason that it first had difficulty   
 was because there was no weight on the
 front of the vehicle.
