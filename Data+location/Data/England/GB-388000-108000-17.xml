		<title>17Pimperne Long Barrow.</title>
		<content> Pimperne Long Barrow is said to be the
 biggest in the country,it is 100m,3m  
 high 30m wide.It was built about 4,000
 years ago.It took a long time because 
 it was built with flint and antler    
 tools.It is probably the burial place 
 of a king or a chief and his family.It
 has never been excavated.From other   
 excavations we think the men who made 
 it were about 1m 73cm tall and        
 the women 1m 63cm.They have good      
 teeth but they had arthritis.

 During the Iron Age about 2,500 years 
 ago there was a settlement of huts    
 made of wattle and daub in Pimperne.A 
 copy of one can be found at Butser    
 Hill in Hampshire.
