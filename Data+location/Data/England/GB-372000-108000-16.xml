		<title>16At school in Hazelbury Bryan</title>
		<content>   Most of the pupils who attend       
 Hazelbury Bryan School travel by      
 school bus or car each morning and    
 arrive at 8.45a.m. because their      
 houses are scattered over a 15 square 
 mile area. At 9.05 a bell is rung and 
 we line up. Classes are split into    
 work groups so that each has to follow
 a daily timetable which is usualy     
 written on the board. We work at some 
 form of mathematics and English in the
 mornings, with science and topics. The
 afternoons are for craft, games, and  
 art. We swop teachers for music.      
   There are breaks in the afternoon   
 for play, and dinner time is one hour 
 for the juniors and one and a half for
 the infants. At 3.30pm the school bus 
 sets off on its tour around the area  
 and the school day ends.
