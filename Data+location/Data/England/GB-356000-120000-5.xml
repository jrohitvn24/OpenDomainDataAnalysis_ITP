		<title>05THE WORK OF A POTTER.</title>
		<content> Mr.Healing has been a potter for      
 ten years.                            
 He works five full days and two       
 half days at the weekend.He makes such
 things as clocks,pots,bowls,dishes    
 cups and mugs.He works in two old     
 garages and has two kilns and three   
 electric pottery wheels.On average he 
 uses one and a half tonnes of clay a  
 year.It takes about three weeks to    
 produce a piece of pottery although   
 he is not working on it for the whole 
 time.First he shapes the article on a 
 wheel and then leaves it a few days to
 dry until it is leather hard.He then  
 cuts patterns into it or gives it the 
 final shaping.Next it is fired.This   
 takes from 18 to 20 hours.After this  
 it is coloured with either purple,    
 brown,blue/grey or white glaze.Finally
 it is fired again.The finished article
 is now ready to be sold.              </content>
