		<title>18POLLUTION</title>
		<content> Pollution has always been a major     
 issue in this area.The heavy          
 industries have done a great deal to  
 improve their pollution control.Most  
 of the area is a smokeless zone.The   
 environmental health officer visits   
 our school,St. Mary's Junior in       
 Grangetown because the school has     
 sample collection apparatus installed 
 in the building.The officer comes on a
 Friday morning to collect the sample  
 bottles and replace them with new     
 ones.The apparatus is stored in the   
 P.E. store room,there is a pipe which 
 goes through the wall to the outside  
 to collect the air samples.The officer
 takes the samples for analysis to The 
 Environmental Health Offices.
