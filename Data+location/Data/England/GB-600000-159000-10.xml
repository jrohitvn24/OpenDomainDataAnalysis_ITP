		<title>10  BENSTEAD HOUSE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> This is an old people's home and      
hospital.The original building,in the  
shape of a square with central yards,  
was built in 1835 at a cost of 6000    
pounds.It was run by the Board of      
Guardians but the hospital is now run  
by Kent area health and the residential
home by the K.C.C.The difference is    
that the hospital needs nursing care   
and the home does not.At the moment    
there are 56 beds.It was all built at  
the same time but a new residential    
home for 20 and a day centre for 30 is 
being built and will be ready in       
September or October 1986.There are    
about 9 bedrooms with 4 or 5 in each   
one.The family of Gange were doctors   
who worked at Benstead House over 114  
years,the last dying about 4 years ago.
A new unit to replace the hospital ward
will be finished by 1988.
