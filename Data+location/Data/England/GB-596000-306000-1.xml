		<content>{Shipdham}is an old village in Mid     
 Norfolk. It got its name originally by
 the amount of sheep kept here.        
{Shipdham}is 19 miles from Norwich.    
 There are 10 shops 1 post office, 3   
 pubs and 3 garages. The Green is in   
 the centre of the village and the sign
 shows the "drynking of church ales" in
 the 1800's. The old school is now a   
 printing hall. The park and the school
 were donated by{Thomas Bullock}and    
 there is still a{Thomas Bullock       
 Trust. The park has many facilities   
 including a recently reformed Scout   
 Troop. The new school was opened in   
 1982. The village population is rising
 all the time but at the moment it     
 stands at 2650. Outside the village   
 there is an airfield built in the war 
 but now used as a flying club and an  
 industrial estate.
