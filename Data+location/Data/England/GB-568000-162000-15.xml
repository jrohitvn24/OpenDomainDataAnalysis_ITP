		<title>15A Bronze Age skeleton</title>
		<content>   In March 1985 Halling quarry workers
 discovered ditches approximately 12   
 metres apart cut into the chalk near  
 Pilgrims Way.                         
  In one ditch they discovered some    
 remains of a body,just feet and ankles
 were found. The rest of the body had  
 been scraped away during quarrying.The
 bronze age body had been buried facing
 the River Medway. Another body was    
 found in a crouching position and     
 covered with large flints.            
   From the state of the teeth the     
 person was rather young(20 or so).It  
 was quite tall.It is rare to find it  
 here.Its age is about 1,000 B.C.      
   In 1912 a skeleton was found in     
 Lower Halling.It was dated about 2,000
 B.C.and is in store at the British    
 Museum.
