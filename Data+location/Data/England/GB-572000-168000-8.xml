		<title>08ROCHESTER IN 1985</title>
		<content>  My dad owns a restaurant amd my mum  
works with my dad.  Some weekends I    
help with the washing the dishes and   
one Sunday l help by clearing up the   
tables after people have left.         
  Rochester is a place where many      
tourists come to see the sights.       
It is a very pretty place and Charles  
Dickens based some of his stories in   
Rochester.  We have a Dickens festival 
in Rochester and the High Street       
is full of stalls with lots of nice    
things to buy.  We all dress up in     
the restaurant.  My mum makes all      
the dresses that the girls wear and she
made the waistcoat for my dad.I don't  
see my mum and dad much in the Dickens 
Festival because they are too busy and 
l have to sleep at my Nan's a lot.     
After the Dickens Festival everything  
goes back to normal.
