		<title>10WILDLIFE IN THE NEW FOREST</title>
		<content>   When I went to the {NEW FOREST}I had
 good fun.  We saw a spider with an egg
 sack.{MICHAEL}was on top of an        
  ants hill and the ants were going up 
 his arms and legs . When the egg  sack
 came off the mummy spider it must have
 taken it somewere to be safe . We     
 went on a bit and we saw a dragonfly  
 and we went to look at it and it      
 looked very nice with black and yellow
 stripes and there were ants on the    
 way.Our teacher moved a stick and     
 the ants put their{antennae}together  
 and told the other ants aboutthe stick
 in the path .  When we went on a bit  
 more I saw a dragonfly but this one   
 was green all over and then we were   
 coming back to school.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
