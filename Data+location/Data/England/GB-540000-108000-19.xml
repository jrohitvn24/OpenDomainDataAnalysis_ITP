      Nineteenth century railway       
 building replaced wooded ground here, 
 but l950-60s closures of lines and    
 goods yards left the surrounding land 
 derelict apart from allotments.       
      Starting l985,{Law courts}will   
 be built where the station stood;     
{shops and supermarket}will open where 
 there is now a carpark; new{carparks  
 for 300 cars;{houses}for 300 people   
 will grow where there are now allot-  
 ments; and the woods, often liable to 
 flooding from the Winterbourne, will  
 contain{picnic spots}beside a{lake    
 where boats can be hired.             
      This will open up land near the  
 heart of Lewes, now little known but  
 soon to be full of activity.          </content>
