		<content> Buttermere, by the still used ancient 
 right of way along the top of the     
 downs, is mainly agricultural with    
 crops, cattle and sheep.   There are  
 about 18 houses approximately a third 
 of which are occupied by commuters to 
 London or nearby towns, a few used as 
 weekend homes and the rest by the land
 owners and farm employees.   The water
 is pumped up the hill from the nearby 
 village of Shalbourne, drainage is by 
 septic tank.   There is mains         
 electricity, though the church, which 
 only has services once a month from   
 May to October, is still lit by       
 candles and oil lamps.   There are    
 many ancient hedgerows, tumuli and    
 earthworks still in the area.   Four  
 very old yew trees in Buttermere Wood 
 have many superstitions attached to   
 them, local people not liking to go   
 there after dark.   A ghost of an old </content>
