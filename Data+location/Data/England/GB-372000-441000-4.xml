		<title>04CLITHEROE'S OLD QUARRY</title>
		<content>    In 1307 where Salthill Quarry is   
 today there was woodland. On the 8th  
 of June 1307 the Earl of Lincoln, who 
 was also the Lord Honor of Clitheroe, 
 decided to make this woodland into a  
 quarry.                               
    The quarrying of limestone for     
 walling and for lime was taking place 
 as early as 1651. This is known       
 because a "Court of Inquiry" for that 
 year made out an order fining people  
 if they extracted limestone without a 
 licence.                              
    To extract the limestone at        
 Salthill the rock face needed to be   
 blasted using high explosives. For    
 many years 'black powder' was used as 
 the explosive. The explosions when    
 blasting in the quarry could be felt  
 all over Clitheroe and as far away as 
 Low Moor.                             
                                       </content>
