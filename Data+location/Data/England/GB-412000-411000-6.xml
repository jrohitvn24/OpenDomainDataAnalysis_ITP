		<title>06HONLEY JUNIOR SCHOOL GAMES</title>
		<content>   There are a number of {games }that  
 children play in the {schoolyard.}One 
 of these games is "Chains-Up" in which
 somebody is 'on' and they have to     
 catch the others. Once they have      
 caught someone they have to hold hands
 and try to catch someone else.        
   Probably the most well known game is
 "Hide and Seek". One of the people has
 to close his eyes and count to a      
 certain number whilst the others go   
 and hide. Then the person who has been
 counting has to go and find the other 
 people who have been hiding.          
   "Chase" is another well known game. 
 It is rather like "Chains-Up", except 
 when you are caught you do not have to
 hold hands.                           
   Other games, such as "Knives, Forks 
 and Spoons", "Hopscotch" and          
 "Skipping" are popular with the       
 youngsters.                           </content>
