		<content>   BATTLE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
 HISTORIC SITES IN BRITAIN BECAUSE IT  
 WAS THE SITE OF THE BATTLE OF         
 HASTINGS. MUCH OF THE VILLAGE IS      
 DEVOTED TO TOURISM. THE SERVICES      
 AVAILABLE INCLUDE HOTELS AND GUEST    
 HOUSES, PUBLIC HOUSES, GIFT SHOPS,    
 CAFES AND RESTAURANTS. MOST VISITORS  
 WALK AROUND THE BATTLEFIELD AND THE   
 ABBEY RUINS AND THEN VISIT THE SHOPS  
 AND CAFES. MOST OF BATTLE'S RESIDENTS 
 FIND THE TOURISTS RATHER A NUISANCE   
 BECAUSE THE SHOPS GET VERY CROWDED,   
 BUT KNOW THAT THEY HELP TO MAKE BATTLE
 PROSPEROUS SO ARE REGARDED AS A       
 NECESSARY EVIL. MANY MORE FACILITIES  
 ARE NEEDED TO COPE WITH THE INCREASING
 TOURIST NUMBERS, SUCH AS MORE CAR     
 PARKS AND A MORE FREQUENT BUS SERVICE 
 TO HASTINGS.
