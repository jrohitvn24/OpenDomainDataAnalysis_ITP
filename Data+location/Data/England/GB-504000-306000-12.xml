 and there was a chance to win a new   
 Vauxhall Nova with the throw of 7 dice
 -no one was lucky! An evening Barn    
 Dance and Barbecue was held in        
 Genever's barn.A car-boot-sale on     
 Sunday was in the field next to the   
 church and a tug-of-war took place    
 between The Parish Council, 2 Youth
