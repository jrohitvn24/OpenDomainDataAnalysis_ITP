		<content> THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL   
 SECURITY:                             
                                       
 It is the biggest office in the       
 Western World.                        
                                       
 The site covers an area of 65 acres   
 and contains one and a half million   
 square feet of office space. It was   
 completed by 1948 and German prisoners
 of war helped to build some of the    
 foundations.                          
                                       
 Each day 8.5 thousand people go to    
 work there and the catering staff run 
 4 restaurants and various cafeterias. 
                                       
 They have their own Bakery, Bank, Post
 Office and Surgery (with four         
 full-time nurses). They have their own
 clubs, sports grounds and social      
 activities.                           </content>
