		<title>12COMMUNICATIONS IN LANDRAKE</title>
		<content> Landrake has developed on both sides  
 of the A38 Trunk Road, one of the two 
 major routeways into Cornwall. During 
 the summer it is very busy,especially 
 on Saturdays when a traffic tailback  
 from the Tamar Road Bridge through    
 Landrake is expected. Each day there  
 are 5 Western National buses to       
 Plymouth and 3 returning.             
 Post is delivered daily by a postman  
 in the mornings.Collections are made  
 from the postbox outside the shop     
 twice a day.The St.Germans doctors    
 hold a surgery in the Village Hall on 
 Fridays and should any prescribed     
 medicines be required,these are sent  
 to Landrake with the postman when he  
 collects the mail.                    
 Draft plans are in existence to       
 re-route the A38 thus by-passing      
 Landrake before the end of the        
 century.                              </content>
