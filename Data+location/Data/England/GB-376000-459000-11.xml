		<content>    This block does not have a long    
 list of "attractions" that pull       
 tourists from all over the country to 
 view them. It is a{quiet, rural       
{backwater}where farming life goes on  
 much as it has done for a number of   
 years.                                
    But perhaps it is just this that   
 does attract some people for a        
 holiday: a{complete change}from the   
 daily hurly-burly of city life. There 
 are{cottages to rent}and some farms   
 have made part of their buildings into
{holiday accommodation, along the lines
{of the French "gite".                 
   {By road,}the holiday maker will    
 find easy{access}to the limestone     
 scenery in the{Dales National Park,}to
 the hills and lakes of the{Lake       
{District,}to the forest of Bowland and
 to the coast of{Morecambe Bay.
