		<title>04PROTEST IN NETTLETON</title>
		<content> Through the Parish Council Nettleton  
 villagers have expressed great concern
 about the proposed new tip(C.F.page   
 3).They have had the advice of a      
 reader in mining and engineering at   
 Nottingham Univ. Residents feel there 
 would be pollution problems from run  
 off water into Nettleton Beck,that    
 there is a danger of Landslip and     
 collapse of the site,not enough       
 account has been taken of the problems
 caused by the mine shafts near the    
 site and that there would be          
 insufficient control of the types of  
 waste to be tipped.It is also felt    
 that the tip would be an eyesore in an
 area of outstanding natural beauty,   
 especially as it is next to the Viking
 Way footpath.Representations have been
 made to the C.C. which will make its  
 decision on 29th.July 1985.
