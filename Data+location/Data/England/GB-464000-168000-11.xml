		<title>11EDUCATION - BURGHFIELD</title>
		<content>   Burghfield St. Marys School provides
 primary education for children from   
 five to eleven years with a complete  
 range of subjects including computers.
  Miss Tunbridge, the Headteacher,     
 thinks French is an important         
 preparation for secondary school.  She
 also thinks computers are very        
 important in preparing people for     
 secondary school.  She thinks project 
 work should promote interest in other 
 people, knowledge of other countries  
 and a questioning attitude towards    
 life.  The sort of person she would   
 like to see going up to secondary     
 school is a confident happy person who
 cares for other people and enjoys     
 working hard.  She is quite happy with
 education but thinks it is affected by
 limitations of space both outdoors and
 indoors.  We have close links with the
 church and do our concerts there.     </content>
