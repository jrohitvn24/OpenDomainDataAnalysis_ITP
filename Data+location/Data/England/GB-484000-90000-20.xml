		<title>20CONCLUSION-SOUTH SELSEY</title>
		<content>   Only two of the 8,9 and 10 year old 
 children who investigated and recorded
 our information live in our area. The 
 elderly predominate, living on their  
 own,or in Rest and Nursing homes.     
  Several of the school parents work as
 staff or as building employees        
 converting larger houses into Homes.  
 Others find seasonal work in          
 Broadreeds Holiday camp; some collect 
 shellfish,which are sold widely.The   
 sea defences have altered the nature  
 of the coast,and the land has now been
 almost fully developed for houses     
 mostly privately owned but with some  
 new council bungalows.Even the few    
 shops are becoming homes. Selsey's    
 business area is in the north part.   
   We thank all who helped, especially 
 classes 4 and 5, their parents,       
 teachers, Mrs. Hickman and all who    
 live and work in Selsey.              </content>
