		<title>14Hampton Railway Station</title>
		<content> I live right next to the{railway}     
{station.}Sometimes when I am waiting  
 for a{train}I see the express train   
 before the train I want to go on, so  
 when the express train has come past  
 us I know that the train I am going to
 go on will be coming soon. Sometimes  
 at night I hear the{express}and if I  
 am quick enough, I look out of the    
 window and I see the sparks of fire   
 coming from the railway line and I    
 hear the crackling noise that it      
 makes.                                
  The station has two long ramp        
 platforms. On one side there is a long
 ramp to exit on and on the other side 
 there are steps. The station has one  
 waiting room on the Birmingham side   
 because more people want to go to     
{Birmingham}than to{Coventry.}From     
 Monday to Saturday there are 66       
 trains.                               </content>
