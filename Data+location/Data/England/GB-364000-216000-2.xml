		<title>02NATURAL FEATURES MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>    Mitcheldean lies in a valley 500   
 feet above sea level on the north     
 eastern edge of the Forest of Dean.   
 The upfold of the Silurian Rocks of   
 May Hill to the north east of the     
 block has caused all the rock beds    
 around Mitcheldean to become steeply  
 inclined to the west. The result is a 
 landscape of parallel Old Red         
 Sandstone ridges and Devonian Red Marl
 valleys. Immediately to the west of   
 Mitcheldean itself, a steep,          
 cliff-like escarpment of Quartz       
 Conglomerate leads to high ground     
 formed of Carboniferous Limestone,    
 rising to over 800 feet above sea     
 level, the highest ground in the area.
 West of this the sandstones and shales
 of the Coal Measures form the rolling 
 plateau of the Forest of Dean, which  
 stretches away south westwards.
