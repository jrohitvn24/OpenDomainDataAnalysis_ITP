		<title>19ART AND CRAFT</title>
		<content> Most art and craft takes place in the 
 Meopham area, many clubs meet in the  
 village hall. There are no clubs at   
 Sole Street.Adults have to go to      
 Cobham or Meopham to join art clubs or
 societies.                            
 The Flower Arrangers of Meopham meet  
 on the first Wednesday of each month  
 at 2.l5 p.m. At their meetings they   
 sometimes have  a demonstrator who    
 shows them ways of arranging          
 flowers.Other times they have a       
 practical meeting when they practise  
 their own arranging. There are 34     
 members at the Wednesday meetings and 
 45 at the Thursday meeting. The flower
 arrangers grow their own flowers.     
 There is an art and craft club which  
 meets at Meopham School each Tuesday.
