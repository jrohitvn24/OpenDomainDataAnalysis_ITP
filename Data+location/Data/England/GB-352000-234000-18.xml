		<content> Over half the people we spoke to go to
{Hereford at least once a week,}but    
 about 12% go{once a month or less.    
 For entertainment,{watching television
 was most popular.   A few people go to
 the{theatre,}and none to the{cinema.  
 Not many said they go to a{pub,}and   
 only two said they read{books.        
{Walking the dog, walking}in the       
 countryside,{fishing, swimming,       
 enjoying{hobbies at home, gardening,  
 and playing{snooker}were mentioned.   
 Just over half thought there was      
{enough to do locally}to entertain     
 them, but nearly half thought there   
 ought to be{more to do locally.       
 Their ideas for more local activities 
 included{live music, clubs or         
{societies}for people with hobbies,    
 and village-based troops for{Brownies,
{Cubs, and Scouts}for the children,    
 who have to travel to meetings.       </content>
