		<content> AN ACCOUNT BY LINDA OKORO.            
 The Broadway shops were scattered     
 among fields in 1924 e.g.the Post     
 Office was a field, Woolworths was a  
 cinema, the Abbey National was a      
 garage,there was nothing on the corner
 until the bank was built. There was no
 road from Hendon except Milespit Hill,
 The Ridgeway and Bunns Lane. The      
 railway brought passengers and freight
 from St.Pancras to Bedford passing    
 Mill Hill Broadway Station which was  
 then called the 'Midland Station'.    
 There was also a railway line (now    
 extinct) joining Finchley to          
 Edgware calling in at the stations of 
 Mill Hill East and the Hale.          
 At this time there were no houses in  
 Lawrence Street,except St.Joseph's    
 Seminary,The Forge,Holcombe House and 
 some farm cottages.The Priory on the  
 Ridgeway was occupied by a Mr.Hudson. </content>
