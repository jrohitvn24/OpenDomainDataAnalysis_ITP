		<content> The whole Upper Heyford area is very  
 intensively farmed. There are many    
 farms all around the village this     
 being the principal industry in the   
 area.                                 
                                       
 Most of the farming is arable although
 there is some mixed farms with dairy  
 herds.                                
                                       
 There are a number of horses          
 kept and also a large number of       
 chickens.                             
                                       
 Farming is intensive with a lot of    
 investment in machinary such as       
 tractors, combine harvestors,and grain
 driers.
