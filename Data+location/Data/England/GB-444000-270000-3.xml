		<title>03CHANGE IN THURLASTON -2</title>
		<content>There were two Marl pits in Thurlaston.
They were dug yearly and spread to give
soil body.One pit was filled in and is 
under the M45,while the other at the   
end of the village was used for the    
village refuse tip when no dustman came
to the village.                        
At the start of this century twenty    
thatched cottages were built,seven near
the A45.Now there are only two,with two
others having tinned roofs.When fire   
insurances were introduced,plaques or  
metal discs were fixed on the          
house.Today a plaque can be seen on    
Stanley's farmhouse,next to Church     
Lane.                                  
Before the motorway,a straight lane    
led into the village and where the     
motorway crosses a large shallow pond, 
the Town pit, was used for watering the
horses on their way home.
