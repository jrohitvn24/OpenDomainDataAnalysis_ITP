		<content>   The area is  mainly{rural}, with the
 south  half  of  the  country  town of
 Buckingham  and the eastern portion of
 Gawcott  village being  the only areas
 of  population. About 75%  of the area
 is farmland. The River {Ouse }meanders
 eastwards through the town.           
   There is some manufacturing present,
 an{engineering }works  and to the west
 a paint  factory  and to  the  south a
 larger  one  making lighting  products
 for the car industry.                 
   A new{ring road}carries  the A421 in
 a loop  south of  the town. The  small
{University,}the  first  of its kind in
 the country, has largely  made  use of
 existing buildings within the the town
 itself.  A  number   of  new  {housing
{developements }are  infilling  between
 the old town and the ring road.
