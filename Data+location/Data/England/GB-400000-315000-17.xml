		<content> {Hagley Park Comprehensive} was opened
in 1956 as a result of the influx of   
miners from the North-East to work     
in the new Lea Hall Colliery.          
The school is close to the Pear Tree   
Estate where many miners and their     
families live.                         
 {Fair Oak Comprehensive} was opened in
1967 as a purpose-built comprehensive  
school on the closure of Rugeley       
Grammar School and the changing of     
education in Rugeley to the            
comprehensive system. Further          
buildings were added in 1974 and 1976. 
 At present Hagley Park and Fair Oak   
teach pupils aged 11-18 years.         
 Both schools will cease to exist in   
July 1986. They will re-open under new 
names, with more pupils and an age     
range of 11-16 years, as 3 local       
schools are being merged into 2. There 
will be a separate 6th form centre.    </content>
