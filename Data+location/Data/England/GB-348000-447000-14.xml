		<content> Fishing is a popular leisure activity 
 which takes place on the canal, the   
 river and in flooded gravel pits. The 
 canal is owned by British Waterways   
 and is stocked with coarse fish       
 viz.Tench,Perch,Pike,Roach and Eel. It
 is a focus for many weekend anglers   
 who take part in competitions along   
 its length.Stretches of the River Wyre
 are leased to private angling         
 clubs.The Wyre has natural supplies of
 sea trout and salmon,these are        
 supplemented by the angling clubs who 
 introduce brown trout at Easter and   
 Whit. The flooded gravel pits at      
 Scorton are privately owned and are   
 stocked with rainbow and brown        
 trout.As on the River Wyre fly fishing
 takes place here.
