		<content>    Mordiford is situated at the fork  
 formed by the confluence of the Rivers
 Wye and Lugg.                         
    The surrounding area in winter     
 suffers from severe flooding. Along   
 one stretch of the river the farmers  
 have allowed a bank to be built by the
 Welsh Water Authority.  The Levee     
 follows the river's course from       
 Hampton Bishop to Mordiford and up the
 Lugg. This protects some of the       
 surrounding fields and houses from the
 worst effects of winter flooding.     
    The river has advantages and       
 disadvantages for farmers:            
    1.many of the fields are regularly 
 covered in a layer of fertile silt but
    2. the flooding often results in   
 the loss of winter crops and damage to
 fields, hedges and livestock etc.
