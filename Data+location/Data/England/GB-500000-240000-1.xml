		<title>01STEWARTBY AND ENVIRONS</title>
		<content> Stewartby is situated to the south of 
 Bedford. The village lacks amenities  
 because of the proximity to Bedford.  
 Stewartby exists because of the long  
 established brickworks, which provide 
 employment for the majority of the    
 village. Unfortunately, the area is   
 spoilt by the pollution and extraction
 caused by such an industry.           
                                       
 The housing in Stewartby belongs to   
 the works which built the houses at   
 the same time, making the layout very 
 regular.                              
                                       
 Even aspects of the environment are   
 affected by the brickworks, for       
 example the lake is a filled-in       
 quarry. Living and working together   
 understandably makes people insular.
