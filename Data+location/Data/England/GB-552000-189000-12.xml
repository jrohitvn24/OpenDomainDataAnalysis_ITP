		<title>12The Nelmes area</title>
		<content> In our area there are lots of roads   
 with Nelmes in there names i.e Nelmes 
 Crescent.Now we have a school called  
 Nelmes.We used to have a manor called 
 Nelmes Manor.It was pulled down in    
 1957.It used to be called Elmes after 
 a big Elm tree.The first owner of the 
 manor was Sir William Roche.He had a  
 son called John.John was 24 years old 
 when his father died in 1549.When his 
 son took over he sold the manor to a  
 man called Robert Harvey.The manor    
 owned 290 acres of land used for      
 farming .                             
 The manor had lots of owners but the  
 most famous of them all was Thomas    
 Witherings because he set up 8 post   
 roads.There is now a road named after 
 him called "The Witherings".
