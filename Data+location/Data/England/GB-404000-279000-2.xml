		<title>02Cadbury's of Bournville</title>
		<content>In 1879{George Cadbury}moved his cocoa 
factory to its present site alongside  
the{Birmingham-Worcester Canal}and the 
{railway}linking Birmingham with London
Bristol and Birkenhead, where it could 
have its own{wharfs and sidings}. The  
business expanded, producing a wide    
selection of chocolate products so that
it is now Britain's{largest exporter}of
chocolate.{Transport}of these goods is 
still aided by the site which is not   
only adjacent to the railway but lies  
on the{Outer Ring Road}, between the   
{A441 and the A38}which gives quick    
access to the{M5 and M6 Motorways.}Over
the years the company has amalgamated  
with other companies, the most recent  
being the merger with Schweppes and    
Typhoo to form the{Cadbury-Schweppes   
Group}which produces a wide range of   
soft drinks, tea and biscuits, as well 
as their selection of confectionery.   </content>
