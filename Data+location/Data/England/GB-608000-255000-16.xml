		<title>16Types of Housing in Creeting</title>
		<content>  We took an area in the centre of     
Creeting St. Mary to compare the types 
of housing. Altogether we surveyed 65  
houses.                                
  Much the largest group were recently 
built detached houses. There were 27 in
all. Next came modern chalet bungalows.
There were 12 of these. Closely follow-
ing this were 10 semi-detached houses{8
of these were post-war council houses}.
After this came 6 semi-detached        
cottages and 5 detached cottages. Many 
of these had been built in the 16th and
17th centuries and all were over 100   
years old. Finally there were three old
terraced cottages and two modern       
bungalows.                             
  This survey showed and was fairly    
typical of the whole village, that     
there were very few really old houses  
and that by far the majority had been  
built in the last 30 years.            </content>
