		<title>09COLCHESTER OYSTERS-PREDATORS</title>
		<content> The presence of oysters in the waters 
 of the Pyefleet Channel has encouraged
 the spread of other wild-life in the  
 area:the oysters natural predators!   
 star-fish,limpets,oyster-catchers     
 lobsters,crabs,even foxes can all     
 break into the seemingly impregnable  
 oyster-shell.The star-fish wraps its  
 five limbs round the shell and        
 maintains a relentless pull upon it   
 until the exhausted oyster is forced  
 to open.The limpet bores a hole       
 through the shell.Lobsters and crabs  
 have claws sufficiently powerful to   
 smash the tough shell.Foxes and       
 Oyster_Catchers can prise it open.Most
 dangerous of all has been Man,because 
 it is his pollution of the water that 
 has done greatest harm and changed the
 oyster from a standard food for the   
 poor of Victorian England to the      
 expensive delicacy of today.          </content>
