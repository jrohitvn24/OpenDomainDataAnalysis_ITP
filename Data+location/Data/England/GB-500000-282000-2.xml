		<content>       HISTORY OF THE BUILDING         
                                       
   The saddle-back late Norman tower is
 all that remains of a late twelfth    
 century church.It has bell openings   
 to the east and a small round-headed  
 window. At the foot of the north wall 
 are three blank arches, round and     
 pointed in shape with leaf decoration.
   The present chancel and nave were   
 built in the thirteenth century. The  
 northern arcade dates from this       
 period, but the south end is from the 
 fourteenth century when the aisles    
 seem to have been rebuilt and widened.
 At this time the clestory was added,  
 the porch was erected and some        
 alterations made in the tower.        
   The circular font dates from about  
 thirteenth century and is adorned with
 dogtooth, roses, stiff leafed foliage 
 and two human heads.                  </content>
