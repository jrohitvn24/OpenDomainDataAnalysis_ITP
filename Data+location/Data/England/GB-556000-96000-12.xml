 to a large extent on the summer       
 tourist trade and there are many      
 hotels and guest houses in the town.  
 Part of the attraction of the area is 
 the open downland to the west of the  
 town and the numerous sporting        
 facilities.London is within easy reach
 by road or train and Eastbourne has   
 built up a reputation as a family     
 holiday resort.                       
    The area around Eastbourne is      
 regarded as a healthy area to live.   
 It gets more than average sunshine and
 the sea air is bracing. In addition to
 summer visitors many old people retire
 to Eastbourne because of the climate. 
 At the weekends and at holiday time   
 one can see many cars parked along the
 coast road leading to Beachy Head. The
 tourists like to sit there and        
 relax,enjoying the sunshine and view. </content>
