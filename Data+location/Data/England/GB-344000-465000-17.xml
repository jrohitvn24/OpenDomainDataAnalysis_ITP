		<content>The railway running through            
Slyne-With-Hest is the main west coast 
route from London to Glasgow. This     
line is electrified by overhead cables 
and enables passengers to travel from  
Lancaster to London in just over 3     
hours.There is no station in Hest Bank 
now -it was closed in the              
1960's.However,there is a busy level   
crossing and signal box at Hest Bank-  
allowing motorists to drive across the 
railway onto the shore.Local services  
using the railway line through         
Slyne-With-Hest go from Lancaster to   
Barrow ;to Windemere ;and via Carnforth
to Leeds.Passengers travelling by train
through Slyne-With-Hest pass within    
metres of Morecambe Bay and are able to
get a panoramic view of the Lakeland   
hills.
