		<title>10AYLESTONE SCHOOL - HEREFORD</title>
		<content>    This comprehensive school has 1150 
 pupils, in the age range 11-16.       
    It was formed in 1976 with the     
 amalgamation of the former Boys' and  
 Girls' Grammar Schools.               
    Modern buildings were completed in 
 1982 to house the school on one site. 
 The school is set in spacious grounds 
 on the Aylestone Campus. It has its   
 own open air swimming pool and games  
 fields.                               
    Pupils' uniform is grey with a     
 black blazer for the boys and a gold  
 checked blouse for the girls.         
    The school has placed special      
 emphasis on extra curricular          
 activities.                           
    School buses provide transport for 
 those pupils living more than 3 miles 
 away; many come from villages such as 
 Withington, Marden, Shellwick, Sutton,
 and Munstone.                         </content>
