		<content>    Quite a lot of people in Oldbury on
 Severn work on the farms in the area. 
 Some are self-employed builders and a 
 few work in the Power Station.  Most  
 of the other villagers have to leave  
 the village to go to work.            
    Some people still work at the old  
 crafts but these are just hobbies     
 rather than full time jobs.  These    
 include cider making, basket weaving  
 and putcher making.  Putchers are used
 for trapping Severn salmon.           
    The only other jobs are part-time  
 jobs at the two pubs, egg farm and the
 Water Board.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
