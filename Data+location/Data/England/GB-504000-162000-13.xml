    There are 60 police officers at    
 Addlestone Police Station which covers
 three divisions of Surrey.  The       
 station has eight cells, six for men, 
 and two for women.  Addlestone and the
 surrounding area is quite affluent, so
 there is not much serious crime.  Over
 the past few years however, there has 
 been a steady rise in crime. The most 
 common crime is bicycle theft,        
 approximately ten percent of all      
 crime.  Violent crime is comparatively
 rare but some of the more serious     
 crimes are committed by gangs from    
 London. The most likely age for a     
 criminal is between 19 and 26 years.  
 More men commit crime than women. For 
 every 100 crimes reported 47 are      
 solved.
