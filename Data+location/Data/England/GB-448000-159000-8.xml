		<content>     There are a number of game copses 
 in the area and a{gamekeeper}is       
 employed to rear pheasants on the     
 Sydmonton Court estate.The majority   
 are{English pheasants}mixed with a few
{black pheasants.}Two_week old{poults} 
 (chicks) are purchased and reared in  
 captivity until they are large enough 
 to be released into the woods.The     
 gamekeeper is kept even more busy     
 watching over the young poults when   
 they are in the wild.Pathways called{ 
{rides}are strewed with straw.Grain is 
 scattered there every day to encourage
 the pheasants to stay in the          
 area.Patrolling at night is another   
 part of a gamekeeper's job,as poaching
 is a constant threat.                 
     The open season for shooting      
 starts in October,organized shoots are
 very expensive.Gamekeeping is a       
 mixture of conservation and sport.    </content>
