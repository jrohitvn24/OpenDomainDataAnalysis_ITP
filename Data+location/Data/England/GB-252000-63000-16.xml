		<title>16Tin Mining at Clearbrook</title>
		<content>{Clearbrook}was once a mining          
 village,most of the miners lived      
 there.The houses that they used to    
 live in still stand to this day.In the
 1920's the houses were changed from   
 oil lamps to using electricity.The    
 houses are very small,the doors and   
 windows are tiny because the people   
 used to be smaller.At first the mine  
 was a {Copper Mine} until the copper  
 ran out,then it changed to{Tin.}There 
 could still be some old miners living 
 in{Clearbrook}.Most houses in {       
{Clearbrook}are modern now,but the     
 older miners cottages still           
 survive.There is a Pub called {The    
{Skylark},in 1790 it was a barn and    
 then it was turned into an Ale House  
 so that the{Tin Miners}could go       
 somewhere for a drink.
