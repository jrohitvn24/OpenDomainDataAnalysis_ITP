		<title>11The Glasshouses.</title>
		<content> Market gardening is very important in 
 the area where we live. There are lots
 of firms with huge areas covered by   
 glasshouses. The glasshouses are used 
 to grow lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes  
 and peppers. On our way to the        
 glasshouses we passed houses and      
 farms. Our teacher called in at the   
 main building. He met the manager who 
 said he was too busy to show us round 
 because it was their busiest time of  
 the year. The manager said he would   
 contact us when he was less busy but  
 fortunately our teacher knew one of   
 the glasshouse workers and he promised
 to tell us something about working in 
 the glasshouses. This is what he told 
 us.                                   
  "We grow many different types of     
 vegetables. It all depends on the     
 season. For example, in Summer we grow
 cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers.      </content>
