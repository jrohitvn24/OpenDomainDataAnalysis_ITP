		<content>  The fields around Whatfield are      
mostly used for growing oil seed rape, 
 barley and peas.                      
  When the barley is about 60 to 100   
centimetres high it is cut and         
collected by a combine harvester.The   
grain is used for cattle feed,brewing  
and sometimes milled for flour.        
  The oil-seed rape has very bright    
yellow flowers and makes the           
countryside look very pretty.It grows  
to at least one metre high and when the
flowers die the pods grow which contain
the seeds.The farmer leaves them to    
ripen until they turn black.When the   
seeds are ripe they are pressed for the
oil and used for cooking or adding to  
many products.                         
  In this area the farmer also grows   
peas,it helps the land and is used for 
animal feed or sent to the vegetable   
market.                                </content>
