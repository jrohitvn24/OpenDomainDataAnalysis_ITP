		<title>09SINCLAIR C5 CARS</title>
		<content>{Sir Clive Sinclair}has recently       
 invented and produced a novel electric
 car designed to appeal to people      
 wishing to escape from normal petrol  
 driven vehicles.In 1985 we visited the
 Research Department at the Science    
 Park,and we learned that Sinclair hope
 to be producing a 4 seater family car 
 with a range of above 100 miles and   
 running completely on batteries within
 10 years .Sir Clive Sinclair was also 
 responsible for the first cheap       
 computer the ZX80 and followed this up
 with the ZX81,the Spectrum and the QL.
 In 1985 his computer company struggled
 and had to be helped by Sir Robert    
 Maxwell,a famous publisher.His C5 has 
 not been selling well and only time   
 will tell as to whether the future for
 transport lies with this sort of      
 development.
