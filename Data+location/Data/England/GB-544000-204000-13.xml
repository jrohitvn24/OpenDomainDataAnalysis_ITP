		<title>13COMMONERS RIGHTS</title>
		<content> In many areas the local residents had 
 the right to graze animals on any land
 which was unfenced and lay within the 
 village boundaries. Most of these     
 Commoners Rights,as they were called, 
 were lost during the Enclosures.Rights
 in Thornwood may have been lost at    
 this time,but the large area of Rye   
 Hill retained its rights till the     
 1940's.Only a very few local          
 inhabitants could lay claim to these  
 rights.One local farmer is well versed
 in commoners rights and one of her    
 workers still keeps cattle tethered on
 the broad verges which are al that    
 remains of the Common.Keeping any     
 livestock in such a way is a very     
 unusual sight in this fenced and      
 hedged arable area.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
