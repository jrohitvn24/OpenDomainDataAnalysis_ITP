		<title>20PEEL HALL PARK</title>
		<content> The New Town has developed a series of
 park land areas around the town and in
 the centre of our block is one of the 
 most recent_ Peel Hall Park. The parks
 are in the care of the Park Ranger    
 Services, with teams of rangers       
 organising activities in the park and 
 working very closely with schools and 
 groups in encouraging local people to 
 get the most out of these areas. Peel 
 Hall Park offers ponds (with pond     
 dipping very popular), woodland areas,
 paddocks for horses,bridleways, a     
 stone circle and a very impressive    
 turf maze. The well trained rangers in
 their distinctive green uniforms are  
 very popular visitors to the schools. 
 During out of school time they        
 organise competitions,7 a side        
 football tournaments and barbecues.
