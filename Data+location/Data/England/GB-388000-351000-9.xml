The school that I go to is Ball Green  
Primary. It is right on the edge of the
countryside. We do a lot of sports like
netball, hockey,rounders,cross-country 
and football. In our school we have    
class assemblies nearly every Friday.  
Somtimes we go on field trips.There    
are twenty nine rooms,fourteen         
teachers,347 children,three assistants,
one caretaker and three cleaners. At   
first playtime some top year children  
sell crisps. Our school is lively and  
has teams or houses which have names of
local places like Whitfield and        
Ridgeway. My favourite subjects are    
P.E. and maths but I dislike Geography 
English and History.
