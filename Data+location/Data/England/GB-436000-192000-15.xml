		<title>15Farm workers and commuters</title>
		<content>There is very little employment in this
area.  In Charney Bassett, apart from  
the few amenities, there are virtually 
no jobs, and most people commute to    
larger towns (e.g. Oxford, Wantage,    
Abingdon etc.).  There is not much     
employment on the farms, most farms are
run by the owner or tenant, with most  
of their employees being close         
relatives (e.g. sons and daughters).   
In this area there are approximately   
20 full-time and 10 part-time employees
on farms in total, and this includes   
family members.In most cases,          
accommodation is provided in farm      
cottages.
