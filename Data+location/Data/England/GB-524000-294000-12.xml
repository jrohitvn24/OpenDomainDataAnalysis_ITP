		<title>12A small fen farm 3</title>
		<content>     Very rarely he looses crops from  
 diseases, but he said once he lost    
 his potatoes from a disease called    
 Blight. But the crop sprays are very  
 good now and the worst thing is the   
 weather. He can loose sugar-beet if   
 there is a strong wind, he also looses
 a lot of crops in the spring.         
     He has a lot of crop sprays but he
 told us that the 3 main sprays are:   
 Pesticide, (kills pests and insects), 
 Hebicide, (kills weeds) and Fungicide 
 (which controls disease).             
     He has 4 wheeled tractors, and 1  
 crawler. He has 1 combine, 1 beat     
 harvester, 1 potato harvester, 1 corn 
 drill, 1 sugar beat drill, 1 potato   
 planter, 1 bailer, ploughs, harrows   
 and cultivaters. Altogether he has 15 
 machines, he said that he is really   
 glad that he has all his machines     
 because without he'd do it by hand.   </content>
