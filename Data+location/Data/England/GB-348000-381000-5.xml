		<title>05Mersey Valley Ranger Service</title>
		<content> There are about 70 Rangers funded by  
 the Mersey Valley Partnership and the 
 Manpower Services Commission.         
     The Service is aimed at making    
 people in the Mersey Valley area aware
 of their surroundings,to take a pride 
 in them and to actively help in       
 restoring an area previously ravaged  
 by industrial development.            
     In locations like Spike Island,   
 Runcorn Hill and Pickerings Pasture   
 Rangers help organise events to get   
 people to use and appreciate these    
 open spaces.They patrol and maintain  
 these areas and act as guides.Local   
 people are invited to help in such    
 activities as tree planting,restoring 
 wildlife habitats,clearing and improv_
 ing paths and stretches of water.     
     Young people can become Ranger    
 Helpers on many of these projects.
