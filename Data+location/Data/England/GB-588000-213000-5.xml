		<content> I have interviewed six people,four of 
 whom were boys,aged eleven,eleven,    
 eleven and ten.When I questioned the  
 boys about Tiptree,two of them said   
 they disliked school,and the other two
 said that they didn't like the fact   
 that Tiptree has not got a swimming   
 pool.While the two older people I     
 interviewed said it had grown too much
 for their liking,everyone else I      
 interviewed said they were happy      
 living in Tiptree.Also three out the  
 four boys said when I asked them the  
 question "What do you like about      
 Tiptree, in general?"They answered    
 that they liked the Sports Centre     
 best of all.
