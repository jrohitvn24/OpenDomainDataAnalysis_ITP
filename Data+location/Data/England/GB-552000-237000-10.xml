 The parish church is the largest in   
 Essex. It stands on one of the highest
 spots in the town and can be seen for 
 many miles.                           
                                       
 Near the church are the ruins of the  
 castle. They are now in th grounds of 
 the museum which has a large          
 anthropololgical section.             
                                       
 The Youth Hostel is in what used to be
 a grain store and mill. It still has  
 the original medieval pegged roof to  
 look up at from in bed.               
                                       
                                       
 On the common is a maze. This is a    
 turf maze with bricks to walk on.     
 Although it is only about 20 metres   
 across it is about a mile to walk the 
 brick path. No one knows its origins. </content>
