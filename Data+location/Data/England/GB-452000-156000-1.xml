		<content>  Kingsclere lies in the northern part 
 of Hampshire, between Newbury in      
 Berkshire and Basingstoke.Kingsclere's
 present population is about 3,070.The 
 village is in a valley below the chalk
 downs.                                
  The centre of Kingsclere consists of 
 an old church, a chapel, several old  
 houses and a few shops, grouped in two
 streets near the square. There are    
 newer housing estates around the      
 village, and more houses are being    
 built at present on two new estates.  
  Two miles east of Kingsclere is the  
 smaller village of Wolverton.It has a 
 park, Wolverton Park, with a lake, a  
 large house and farmland. There is an 
 attractive church on the edge of the  
 estate.                               
  The rest of the area is occupied by  
 farms and the racing stables with     
 their training gallops.               </content>
