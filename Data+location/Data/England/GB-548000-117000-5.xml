 Conference Centre. It is open all year
 and caters for 120 people,            
 accommodating about 7,000 per year. It
 welcomes visitors from all Christian  
 denominations and is extensively used 
 by religious groups from Britain and  
 abroad as well as families and parties
 such as the elderly and girl guides.

 formerly a private house. Now, the 8  
 acre site and grounds, which include  
 a swimming pool, tennis court, croquet
 and putting greens, is owned by an    
 Evangelical Trust. Conferences are    
 held in a large hall which is an      
 extension to the original house. the  
 centre has its own library and        
 self-service book and record shop.
