		<content>    Spriteshall Lane in{Trimley St.Mary
 is known as{Laundry Lane}because there
 is  a large building owned by the     
{National Sunlight Laundry Company     
 where clothes and linen are washed    
 starched and pressed.The clothes are  
 marked to identify them,put them in   
 baskets and taken to enormous washing 
 machines.Once clean they are dried in 
 tumble driers and taken to be pressed.
 this is done by women who put the     
 sheets through a giant mangle to iron 
 out the creases.Two more women stand  
 up the other end and fold the sheets. 
 Smaller items like shirts are taken to
 foam covered models,put on the body   
 and two large padded walls come       
 together and press the shirts.The     
 cuffs and collars are ironed later and
 then the shirt is carefully folded by 
 machine and packed in polythene bags.
