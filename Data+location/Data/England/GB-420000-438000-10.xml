		<title>10A childs life-Rawdon-School</title>
		<content>  This account of a typical childs life
 is based on a survey of 150 children  
 at Rawdon C.E. Most wake at between 7 
 and 8 ,wash,dress and have a cereal   
 breakfast,then clean their teeth and  
 go to school.Just over half walk less 
 than a mile to school,the rest go by  
 car.After morning assembly favourite  
 lessons include mathematics and       
 english,but P.E. is the most popular. 
 In Autumn football and netball are    
 enjoyed but as soon as the snow       
 arrives sliding and building snowmen  
 is popular.In Spring the children play
 marbles and skipping,but Summer brings
 cricket and rounders.At lunch time the
 favourite foods are salad,fish and    
 chips and sausages and beefburgers.15%
 of the children bring a packed lunch. 
 Two thirds of the children in school  
 play a musical instrument-at school or
 at a music centre.                    </content>
