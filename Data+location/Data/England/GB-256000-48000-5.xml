		<title>05BIRDLIFE IN SOUTH DEVON</title>
		<content>     Birdlife in this part of the South
 Hams,Devon,is quite varied.Most       
 noticeable are the rooks,whos noisy   
 behaviour in the high trees is        
 impossible to ignore.Their cousins the
 magpies are also quite common, usually
 seen in pairs.A pair of jays live in  
 the woods near Membland.Also          
 widespread are pigeons,who nest in    
 woods or little-used buildings and are
 regarded by the farmers as pests      
 because of their enormous appetites.A 
 colourful addition to the countryside 
 are pheasnts (or,at least,the cock    
 bird).Once bred to be shot,pheasant   
 shoots are no longer held here so the 
 birds are now wild.They are quite     
 stupid,and often get knocked down on  
 the roads...then quickly taken home   
 for dinner!                           
     Smaller birds here are sparrows,  
 starlings and robins who tend to live </content>
