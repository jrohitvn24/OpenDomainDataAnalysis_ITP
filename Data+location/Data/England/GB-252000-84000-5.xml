		<content>  Dartmoor is a vast area of moorland  
 covered in hills,or it seems like that
 especially around the area of Widgery 
 Cross.The hills around this area would
 probably deter any sane person from   
 setting a foot outside his/her car.   
 Spending a day "killing" yourself     
 climbing up one of these generously   
 built hills would be worthy of getting
 you a place in a mental home,but when 
 you get to the top and look at the    
 view you get a sense of pure          
 exhilaration.Then you can             
 collapse.People who come to this place
 and just sit in their cars are a prime
 example of GROCKLES.They should get   
 out and climb a hill.So what if they  
 die when they get to the top,at least 
 they have deserved a nice place to    
 die.Most people do go and walk miles  
 for fun.this shows how mad people are 
 in 1985.                              </content>
