		<title>12THE BIRMINGHAM CANAL</title>
		<content>  The canal links Oldbury to Birmingham
 and Wolverhampton. It was built       
 originally for carrying coal, but is  
 only used now for recreational        
 purposes.                             
  It has an average depth of three feet
 and can take barges with a beam of six
 feet. The sides were lined with brick 
 and the bottom was of puddled clay.   
  The boatyard in Oldbury, builds      
 between five and six boats each year. 
 The boats measure some seventy feet by
 six feet and are built of mild sheet  
 steel which is cut and welded to      
 shape. Each boat costs around Â£20,000 
 to build.                             
  The Titford canal also runs through  
 the Oldbury area. This has several    
 flights of locks for the boats to     
 navigate through.
