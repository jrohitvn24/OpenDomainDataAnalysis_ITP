		<title>01Our Area</title>
		<content> The area that we have been given to   
 study is rural.We went to a good      
 vantage point and could see fields    
 interspersed with woods and           
 farmland.They looked like a patchwork 
 quilt.There are two landmarks that    
 really show up,the sand and gravel    
 quarry and Marley Tiles.              
      The two biggest woods are        
 The Heugh Wood and Milkwell Burn Wood 
 having mostly deciduos trees in       
 both. The main tourist attraction is  
 the Derwent Walk, an old railway which
 has been made into a walkway.         
      In the area there are ten farms, 
 five churches and three schools.
