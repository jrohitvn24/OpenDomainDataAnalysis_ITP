 Harbertonford School is a Church of   
 England primary school. The children  
 who attend the school are aged between
 five and eleven.                      
                                       
 All the children in the area come to  
 this school.  I live in Harbertonford 
 so I can walk to school.  The children
 who live in the surrounding villages  
 are brought in by car or on a special 
 bus.                                  
                                       
 The school is divided into four       
 classes with about thirty children in 
 each class.  Each class has its own   
 teacher and that teacher takes nearly 
 all of the lessons for that class.    
                                       
 I am in Mr Peach's class.  I am in the
 second year.
