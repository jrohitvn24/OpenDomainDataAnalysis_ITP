		<title>01My dad's milk round.</title>
		<content>{                                      
  When my Dad{delivers milk}it takes   
 him about eight hours to deliver to   
{Horsham, Broadbridge Heath, Southwater
 and the surrounding countryside. In   
 the summer he has to hurry because the
 milk goes sour quickly.               
  I sometimes go out with my Dad and I 
 deliver about{200 pints a day,}if he  
 is a good mood. On the van he carries 
 about 700 pints, sometimes more. It is
 a Ford Transit.                       
  In the front he has a wooden box     
 which I have to sit on. In the box he 
 keeps eggs. Dad also carries bread,   
 potatoes and if asked can supply      
 cream,butter and some meats. At the   
 back of the van he keeps fruit juices 
 and fizzy drinks.                     
  Dad gets the milk from{Horsham Dairy 
 but it originally comes from{Brighton.
