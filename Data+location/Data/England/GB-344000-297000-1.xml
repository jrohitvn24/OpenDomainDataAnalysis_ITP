		<content>  This is a rural area of South        
 Shropshire situated on the edge of the
 National Trust land of the Longmynd   
 where the rolling hills open out into 
 the valley.                           
  The majority of residents live in the
 village of Leebotwood and the hamlets 
 of Smethcott and Woolstaston but there
 are other small scattered communities 
 such as Padmore and Lower Wood, each  
 with their own particular identity.   
  There are three Anglican churches in 
 the area, but no schools or health    
 services.                             
  A main road, A.49, and a regular bus 
 service run through the east side of  
 the area, as does a railway line, but 
 there is no railway station.          
  Farming is the main occupation       
 although small commercial ventures are
 apparent and retired people and       
 commuters are moving into the area.   </content>
