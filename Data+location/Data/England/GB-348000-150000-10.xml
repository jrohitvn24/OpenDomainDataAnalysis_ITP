		<title>10TOURISM IN RODNEY STOKE</title>
		<content> Although only a small village Rodney  
 Stoke is an attractive unspoiled      
 settlement and several houses         
 particularly along the A371 offer     
 holiday accommadation or{Bed &amp;        
{Breakfast}.It is a good place for     
 people who want a quiet holiday.      
 People can visit the resort of Weston,
 the historic cities of Bath and Wells 
 and the Gorge and caves at Cheddar.   
 There is also the opportunity for hill
 walking and pony-trekking over Mendip 
 and people also come because of the   
 unspoiled Mendip scenery. One holiday 
 home in Rodney Stoke is owned by      
 people who live in London. The M5 is  
 easily accessible for tourists who    
 wish to travel south to Devon and     
 Cornwall or north to Bristol and      
 Birmingham. The closest interchange is
 about 12 miles to the west.
