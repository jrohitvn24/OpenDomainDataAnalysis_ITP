		<content>     Nearly everybody in the village   
 has a car and people give each other  
 lifts. The only public services are by
 bus.The regular services are by Hants 
 and Dorset and are part of the route  
 between Weymouth and Bournemouth.There
 is one bus each day from Winterborne  
 Kingston to Poole and one bus in the  
 return direction each day. Access to a
 bus route linking Salisbury,Blandford,
 Dorchester and Weymouth can be gained 
 by a journey of about two miles in a  
 number of directions to the main roads
 over which these routes run. This     
 service is infrequent. There is also a
 market bus which runs from the village
 to Blandford every Thursday morning.  
 The nearest railway station is at     
 Wareham about six miles away where    
 trains on the Waterloo-Weymouth line  
 stop. There is a coach to London every
 day from Bere Regis.                  </content>
