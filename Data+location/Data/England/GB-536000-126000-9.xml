		<content>    We made a local household survey : 
 we found that about 70% of the people 
 need transport to go to work outside  
 the village. The most popular mode of 
 transport is the car, then the buses. 
 A lot of people also use motor bikes, 
 bicycles and horses to get about.     
    We have two garages in the middle  
 of the village, the Crown Garage and  
 the Horsted Keynes Garage. The latter 
 is mainly a car repair workshop; the  
 Crown Garage is also a petrol filling 
 station.                              
    Among the heavy traffic using the  
 local roads are buses, petrol tankers,
 delivery lorries, farm vehicles and   
 lorries from the brickworks. Most of  
 the roads to the village are very     
 narrow. The only local railway is the 
 Bluebell Line for tourists - the      
 nearest main station is at Haywards   
 Heath, five miles away.               </content>
