		<title>18LIFE IN BINGHAM (3)</title>
		<content>    "I like living in Bingham because  
 it has a friendly atmosphere."        
    "It has a good selection of shops."
    "It's in the countryside."         
    "The best thing is it is near to   
 big towns like Nottingham and Newark."
  { However it is hardly perfect and   
{there follows comments on how it may  
{be improved and what some of its      
{problems are considered to be:-       
    "I do not like the pollution from  
 trains and lorries and cars."         
    "To make Bingham a better place I  
 think they should build the bypass    
 they have been talking about. The     
 reason for this is all the lorries    
 bringing lots of fumes in and also it 
 is dangerous trying to get to school  
 over the road."                       
    "I don't like the main road - it   
 makes too much noise."                
                                       </content>
