		<content>   Most of the land around and in      
 Albury is open countryside and        
 undulating hills.                     
   This area is not built up and is    
 mostly grassland and forest.          
   A 20m watertower,in a large wheat   
 field,dominates the landscape at a    
 height of 404ft above sea level,which 
 is about 1.25 miles to the west of    
 Albury Church.                        
   The thirteenth century church has a 
 tower with diagonal buttresses with   
 some very unusual ugly aisle windows  
 due to the sedilias (which is a row of
 seats for priests to sit in)          
  Around the church,Albury boasts some 
 fine cottages dating from the medieval
 period.                               
   Three miles away at Little Hadham   
 some terraced and semi-detatched      
 houses can be found.                  
                                       </content>
