		<title>09How we Relax</title>
		<content> We wanted to find out how most people 
 in our rectangle enjoyed themselves,to
 give us some idea of the{life-style}  
 that was prevalent in the area.We soon
 decided that it was too complicated to
 find one type,so we have made a list  
 of the kinds of things that people    
 here do:Swim,windsurf,sail            
         Watch T.V. Visit Cinema       
         Ride,enter local riding events
         Cycling because it's so flat  
         Play football,golf,cricket etc
 Most people who live here work on the 
 land or have jobs connected with the  
 sea.Very few people commute to places 
 which are far away,though some do     
 travel to London by train.            
 The main differences,were that people 
 didn't seem to move out of the area   
 much,but stayed here to live most of  
 their life.Also plenty of them were   
 able to use the sea for{Recreation.   </content>
