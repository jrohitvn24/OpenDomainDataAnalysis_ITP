		<title>01A summary of our area</title>
		<content> The villages in our area are Marton le
 Moor, Skelton on Ure and Kirby Hill.  
 The A1 separates Kirby Hill in the    
 east from Marton  and Skelton in the  
 west. In between the villages is      
 farmland with winding country lanes.  
 Although the names refer to hill and  
 moor the land is only gently sloped.  
  Kirby Hill is about 22 metres above  
 sea level and the highest point near  
 Marton le Moor is 53 metres.          
 Kirby Hill is the largest village and 
 has many housesbuilt in the last      
 thirty years.                         
 Skelton is an estate village, there   
 has been little development and many  
 of the properties are owned by the    
 estate.                               
 Marton is the smallest village.       
 The whole area is part of the Borough 
 of Harrogate.
