    Change your black shoe.            
 -  Racing car number 9 losing gallons 
    all the time.  How many gallons did
    it lose - l,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.    
 -  Boy scout, walk out, turn a dirty  
    dishcloth inside out.  OUT spells  
    out and you must jolly well go.    
 -  Bluebell, cockleshells, evey, ivy  
    over.  Polly in the kitchen.  Doing
    a bit of stitching.  How many      
    stitches did she do altogether.    
 -  Down Mississippi if you miss a link
    you're out, you're in.             
 -  Vote, vote for little (name) in    
    comes (name) at the door (name) is 
    the one having all the fun, so we  
    don't want (name) any more.  Kick  
    her out, shut the door, say no     
    more.
