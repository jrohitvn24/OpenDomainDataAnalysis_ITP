		<content>    Burton sportsday consisted of many 
 events in which the older pupils      
 competed.The pupils were divided into 
 4 groups red,yellow,green and blue.The
 younger pupils had made badges with   
 the 4 colours on them,and sat on the  
 grass  supporting their team.The      
 pupils parents watched the races and  
 supported the children as they ran.   
 Some events were the egg and spoon    
 race,relays,obstacle course,sack      
 race,100m flat race and High          
 jump.After the childrens events they  
 had invitation races for parents.This 
 the pupils seemed to enjoy most.The   
 team that won the cup was the yellow  
 team.                                 
    Highcliffe sportsday was similar in
 the sense that the school was divided 
 into 6 groups each having a colour.   
 Highcliffe had all track and field    
 events and many records were broken.  </content>
