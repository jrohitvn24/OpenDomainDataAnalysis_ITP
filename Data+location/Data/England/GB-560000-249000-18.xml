		<content> The local police station to this area 
 is in Linton (6 miles away) which     
 covers an area of 13 Parishes using 7 
 constables (1 is a WPC) and a station 
 Sargeant and only 3 vehicles. Policing
 levels are therefore low, with just 1 
 man covering the whole of the West    
 Wickham, West Wratting, Weston        
 Colville and Carlton area. There is a 
 trend now for more friendly policing, 
 where the Parish Councils can         
 influence local decisions. Methods are
 controlled regionally and numbers     
 employed are regulated nationally,    
 though the personnel are always       
 changing.                             
     Crime levels are low in this rural
 area (driving offences by residents   
 but out of this area are probably the 
 most common).
