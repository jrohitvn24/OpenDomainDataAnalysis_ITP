		<content> Some of the houses in our area are    
 very old, in some cases as old as 650 
 years, whilst others are only a few   
 months or years old. Some of the older
 houses are Tudor homes with black and 
 white beams, others are mansion houses
 or houses with grounds of their own,  
 set back in the countryside.          
 A few of the homes were originally two
 or three houses which have now been   
 converted into large single ones.     
 Some of the houses are built in the   
 Sussex style where the roof, instead  
 of going straight up and down in the  
 usual way, have two triangular pieces 
 of tiling added to the gable ends.    
 These houses are typically 250 years  
 old.                                  
 A small estate of eight houses is now 
 being built especially for young      
 people. Hopefully new families will   
 ensure a stable future for Laughton.  </content>
