		<title>10Everyday life in Edenthorpe.</title>
		<content>{Edenthorpe}is developing as a         
 housing and shopping place; a lot     
 of people who live here work in or    
 around Doncaster. On weekdays and on a
 Saturday the shops are fairly busy    
 with lots of people at the counter,   
 but if you get there too late the     
 shops have sold out. The queues are   
 long so you have to wait several      
 minutes to be served. The roads -     
{Thorne Road}for example - are noisy   
 and busy with cars.                   
 On Sunday it is much more peaceful;   
 the village is quiet, the roads are   
 almost empty. Many people wash their  
 cars, or do jobs around the house, or 
 watch the television. On days like    
 this it is good to walk into Shaw Wood
 or along some of the local paths where
 you feel as if you are in the         
 countryside.
