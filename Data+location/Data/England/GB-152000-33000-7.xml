 Ministry that is the end of June to   
 the end of July the sheep, other than 
 those pregnant are dipped.   The      
 process of dipping means that the     
 sheep are completely submerged under a
 liquid designed to kill off scab etc. 
      On the farm much grass is cut for
 silage and hay. Also on the farm      
 daffodils are grown in large          
 quantities and cut in January and     
 February to catch the early markets in
 such places as Sheffield. Glasgow and 
 Convent Garden &lt;London), these flowers
 can be kept in a freezer on the farm  
 if necessary to keep fresh.
