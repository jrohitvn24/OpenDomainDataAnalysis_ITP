		<title>13CHILDRENS' GAMES IN STRETTON</title>
		<content>   At school most children play games  
 like: Hopscotch, Chase, Tick,         
 Blackout, Budge, Skipping, Polo, Off  
 ground tick and Gooley ghosty.        
   British bulldogs is another well    
 known game that everybody likes. It is
 an easy game. You just try to run from
 circle to circle without being caught.
   Everybody seems to like all         
 these games but the boys and Netball  
 do not seem to fit.                   
                                       
   When it is raining we have to go in 
 and play cards or draw or just read.  
 But if it is a nice sunny day children
 are allowed to go down the field to   
 play if they like.                    
   These are some of the games         
 children play in Church Stretton.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
