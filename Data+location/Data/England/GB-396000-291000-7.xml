		<content> InTipton there is plenty of vandalism.
 There are windows being broken all of 
 the time and spraying of paint on the 
 walls. Every house that is empty has  
 boards up because all of the windows  
 have been broken, and the boards are  
 covered with writing. On the          
 lamp-posts the steel covers have been 
 broken off so that the wires explode  
 and catch fire.Then peoples lights go 
 off because the lamp-posts are        
 connected to the electricity mains.   
 There are also a lot of broken bottles
 on the ground so that if you fall you 
 cut yourself.There are broken-down    
 walls too, that  have been            
 deliberately pushed down. Tipton is a 
 depressing place!
