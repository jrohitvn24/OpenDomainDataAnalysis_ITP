		<title>08BROWN AND HUNT COMPANY(CONT)</title>
		<content> Brown and Hunt not only breed rare    
 pigs but they also make fencing,this  
 makes the farm a diversion farm.Mr    
 Brown bought the land 4 years ago when
 it was on the market.It used to be an 
 army camp in the second world war.The 
 building that the fencing is made     
 in, is the only building from the     
 camp left.Mr. Brown has 16 staff and  
 he has to work every day and he only  
 has one week off per year.            
 He hasn't any dislikes some he must   
 like the sound of nails being shot    
 into the wood!he hasn't got any plans 
 for expansion because he is going to  
 retire in about 2 years time.         
 All the tools are run on compressed   
 air which is cheaper and safer.
