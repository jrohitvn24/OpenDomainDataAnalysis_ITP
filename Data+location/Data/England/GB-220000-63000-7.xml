		<content>   BOTH DOBWALLS AND TREVELMOND HAVE A 
 METHODIST CHAPEL.THEY SHARE A MINISTER
 WITH 7 OTHER CHAPELS. BOTH CHAPELS    
 HAVE A SUNDAY SCHOOL AND 2 SUNDAY     
 SERVICES.                             
  THERE IS AN ANGLICAN CHURCH AT       
 DOBWALLS AND ANOTHER JUST OUTSIDE     
 TREVELMOND AT ST.PINNOCK. THESE ARE   
 SERVED BY CLERGY FROM THE LISKEARD    
 TEAM MINISTRY.                        
  RELATIONS BETWEEN CHURCH AND CHAPEL  
 HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN BAD,BUT HAVE  
 IMPROVED MARKEDLY.ALL THE CLERGY MEET 
 TOGETHER WEEKLY.IN DOBWALLS ALL CHURCH
 MIDWEEK MEETINGS ARE NOW JOINT. IT IS 
 THE AIM OF THE CLERGY TO HAVE A JOINT 
 CHURCH IN DOBWALLS.                   
  TEETOTALISM IS STRONG IN THE AREA &amp;  
 THIS HAS CAUSED SOME FRICTION WITH THE
 LOCAL COMMUNITY.NOW THE CHURCHES ARE  
 TRYING HARD TO BUILD UP THE SENSE OF  
 COMMUNITY IN A CHANGING AREA.         </content>
