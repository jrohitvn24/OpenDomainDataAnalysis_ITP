		<title>12THE LOCAL PAPER,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  The Holderness Gazette on the corner 
 of Queen Street and Seaside Road is   
 the local paper.6,200 copies are      
 printed every Thursday and sent to 42 
 towns and villages, as far as         
 Paull,Hedon and Preston to the west,  
 Easington to the south and Atwick and 
 Hornsea to the north.In the Hornsea   
 area the paper becomes the Hornsea    
 Gazette with its own local news, but  
 it is still printed by the same       
 company.                              
  The paper has an office staff of 5   
 full-time and 3 part-time workers,    
 including the editor,but the printing 
 is done by a private firm in          
 Withernsea called Lunns.The paper also
 uses freelance photographers.The price
 of the paper is 16p but if it were not
 for private advertising which takes up
 55% of the paper the cost would be    
 nearer Â£1.Adverts cost Â£1.05 per cm.  </content>
