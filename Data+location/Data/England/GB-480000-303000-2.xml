		<title>02History of Leighfield Forest</title>
		<content> Leighfield was originally a deer park 
 and the lodges lying within it were   
 hunting lodges used by the gentry for 
 hunting parties. The County boundary  
 by Launde Park Wood follows a deep    
 ditch and hedge which formed the deer 
 boundary. Prior to the 1938_45 war the
 only remaining areas of forest were   
 Priors Coppice (830055) and Launde    
 Park Wood (803035) and the rest of the
 area was used for grazing.            
 With the advent of the 1938-45 war,   
 the Ministry of Agriculture took over 
 the land, ploughed it, and used it for
 food production. The hedges were kept 
 intact until after the war. The land  
 was sold to the Merchant Venturers who
 rent it to a farming company. Many of 
 the original hedges have now been     
 removed to make larger fields.
