		<title>11Social Concerns,Wishford.</title>
		<content> People are worried about the younger  
 people moving away from the village to
 towns to get jobs.Also they are       
 concerned about the lack of facilities
 for the young children,only some      
 swings and they are near the main     
 road.                                 
   Villagers do not like the A36 road  
 through the valley, because it was not
 designed for big lorries and heavy    
 traffic, and it is a very dangerous   
 road to cross.                        
   People are concerned about the new  
 by-pass they are worried about it     
 spoiling the countryside though they  
 do admit a new road is necessary.     
   Another worry is that small village 
 schools will close down in the future.
