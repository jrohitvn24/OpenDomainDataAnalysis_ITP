		<content>{Vet.}The vet in Leintwardine gets his 
 equipment from Birmingham and         
 Shrewsbury. He has lots of drugs and  
 pills. He told us that he had treated 
 a few wild animals such as Monkeys,   
 Snakes,a Zebra,a Lion,a Tiger and     
 some Chimpanzees,but not in           
 Leintwardine. He has also had some    
 birds of prey in like Kestrels,Falcons
 and Buzzards. He has had in some      
 budgies and parrots. The vet has 8 to 
 100 animals a week to deal with. If he
 cannot deal with an animal he sends it
 to Bristol.                           
{Pets.}Results of a local survey.      
 There were 119  birds. Some people had
 aviaries. 41 fish _ some were         
 tropical. We thought dogs and cats    
 would be the most popular and we were 
 surprised that there were 17 fowl.    
 There were only 2 or 3 people that    
 didn't have any animals.              </content>
