		<content> The school was founded  in 1591. In   
 1854 it moved from its original site  
 near the market place to occupy the   
 premises of the defunct Wakefield     
 Proprietary Scool in Northgate. The   
 buildings were extended in 1891 and   
 1910. A junior school was also added. 
 Extra classrooms and laboratories were
 built in 1952 and the Queen Elizabeth 
 Hall in 1958. Further rooms were added
 in 1959, a new gym in 1960 and the    
 Baggaley Building in 1973. A sixth    
 form centre and music block were      
 opened in 1979 and additional space   
 for art,computing and CDT in 1982.    
 There are 880 boys (170 juniors, 710  
 seniors) in school, drawn mainly from 
 West and South Yorkshire. Formerly a  
 Direct Grant school, it went          
 independent in 1976 and since 1981 has
 been involved in the adjusted places  
 scheme.               N.RIGBY         </content>
