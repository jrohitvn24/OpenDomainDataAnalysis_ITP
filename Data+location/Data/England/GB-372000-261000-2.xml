		<content>   The population of the block is 354, 
 consisting of 57% working age, 17%    
 retired and 26% school age. There are 
 two main concentrations of population:
 along the Martley Hillside road,      
 75.61, and the bungalows in Shelsley  
 Beauchamp, 73.63. Nearly all the      
 houses including the bungalows are    
 owner-occupied.                       
   Of the 202 people of working age 15%
 are self-employed; activities range   
 from computer services, plastering and
 mechanics to odd jobs, while 15% work 
 on the land and 5.4% are unemployed.  
 Worcester provides more jobs than any 
 other town (8%) but people travel to  
 Bromsgrove, Birmingham, Stourbridge,  
 and Wolverhampton among others.
