		<title>15Local History-Sprowston</title>
		<content>   It is believed that the village of  
 Sprowston was founded during the 9th  
 century Danish invasion because the   
 name Sprow is a Scandinavian personal 
 name.Ton, of course ,means town or    
 village.                              
   When Sprowston was mentioned in the 
 Domesday Book it was a small and      
 rather run down village with two      
 "holdings".                           
    These limited and domniated        
 life until late in the 19th century.  
   In the 1930's the fields and lanes  
 began to disappear. Since the last war
 there has been continued development  
 and the village ,which was once small,
 has been turned into a large urban    
 community.  Recently bulit industrial 
 estates now provide employment for the
 increased population of 14,309.It is  
 estimated that over 400 new houses    
 will be built in the near future.     </content>
