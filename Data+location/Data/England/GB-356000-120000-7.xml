		<content> In Marston Magna all the people are   
 very friendly.Most of them join in    
 with the  activities that go on.There 
 are lots of things to do.There is the 
 Women's Institute in which the women  
 join in with the activities  around   
 the village .They have meetings and a 
 speaker comes to talk to them.There   
 are competitions such as baking a     
 cake .The best one gets a small prize.
 The British Legion is made up of      
 mainly ex service men and old people. 
 The wives and ladies are sometimes    
 invited along.There are no youth clubs
 and so the children have to go to     
 villages outside Marston.The village  
 hall once belonged to the Foresters.  
 The entertainment in the village is   
 put on by everyone.They all join      
 together and put on shows.Every two   
 weeks there is a bingo game in the    
 British Legion.                       </content>
