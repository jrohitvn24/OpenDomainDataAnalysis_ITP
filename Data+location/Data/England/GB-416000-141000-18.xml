		<title>18Interview with Mrs Allen</title>
		<content> I interviewed a housewife to find out 
 the major changes in the area in the  
 past 30 years.She thought that of     
 great loss to the area was the closure
 of its railway branch line,first to   
 passengers in 1952,then freight in    
 1963.An improvement to communications 
 came with the opening of the A303 dual
 carriageway in 1969, by-passing       
 Amesbury and protecting its streets   
 from the ever increasing traffic.     
   The population of Amesbury has more 
 than trebled in 30 years as a result  
 of the Military presence.An extension 
 to the existing Council housing estate
 was completed in 1974.The Secondary   
 Modern School turned Comprehensive in 
 1978.A number of small industries have
 developed some geared to the Leisure  
 industry but the major employers      
 remain the Naafi and Ministry of      
 Defence.                              </content>
