		<title>10People Who Help Us,Stebbing</title>
		<content> We  Have a branch surgery in Stebbing 
 on Mondays from 10_11am.It has been   
 held in the United Reformed Church    
 since the 1930's.The doctor carries   
 his instruments and medicines with    
 him.He makes lots of house calls as   
 there is almost no puplic transport.  
            The Policeman              
 We have had our own police house and  
 part time service in Stebbing since   
 1949.Road accidents and vandalism     
 cause few problems as it is a         
 low_abiding village.                  
            District Nurse             
 There are two district nurses and an  
 auxiliary attached to the surgery.They
 visit mothers with young babies,old   
 people and people,who need a nurse and
 are too ill to go to the Surgery.
