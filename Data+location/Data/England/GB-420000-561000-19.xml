		<title>19TYNESIDE COMMERCIAL PARK</title>
		<content>  Here the{MetroCentre}with its large  
 stores and car parks in a landscaped  
 area, will occupy a 115 acre site     
 between the{Western Bypass}and the R. 
 Tyne west of Dunston. Since it lies   
 within the{Enterprise Zone}there are  
 considerable advantages to be enjoyed 
 here-exemption from rates,capital     
 allowances for the cost of development
 and simplified planning permission.   
  Excavations of the site once occupied
 by the ash disposal site for Dunston  
 power Station began in 1984 and it is 
 hoped that the{first of the stores    
{will be open by 1987 .}Although not   
 all  of the information concerning the
 nature of the premises has as yet been
 released .It is expected to draw its  
 customers from the whole of the Tyne  
 and Wear area. Firms such as Marks &amp;  
 Spencer and Carrefours have  begun    
 construction of large new stores.     </content>
