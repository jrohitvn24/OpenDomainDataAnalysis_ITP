 The quarry is over ever-changing      
 acreage because quarried land is      
 reclaimed whilst farmland is regularly
 purchased and then quarried.The quarry
 is wet-working,pumping about 80 tons  
 per hour from a natural lagoon through
 a dredger to a grading machine.The    
 depth of sand is about 8 metres and   
 the supply, providing the land can be 
 acquired, is almost inexhaustible.    
   The sand here is of a fine, high    
 quality. Approximately 50% is fine    
 building sand and the other half is   
 slightly coarser sand for concrete.   
 There is a negligible amount of       
 aggregate mixed with it when it is    
 dredged, but this is easily dealt with
 in the grading machine. There is a    
 considerable amount of silt (too fine 
 to be used) which is pumped back into 
 the lagoon as infill.                 </content>
