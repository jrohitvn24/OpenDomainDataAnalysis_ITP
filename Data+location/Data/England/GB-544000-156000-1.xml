		<title>01Knockholt? Cudham? Or?</title>
		<content> This area covers parts of the parishes
 of Brasted, Chevening, Sundridge,     
 Cudham and Knockholt, but no centre of
 population. As it contains Knockholt  
 Church and School we will refer to it 
 as Knockholt. Administratively it is  
 shared between the London Borough of  
 Bromley and Kent County Council. The  
 M25 and A233 cut across the southern  
 corners, the M25 is often audible.    
 There are two pubs and a very limited 
 bus service. At the highest point     
 there are wireless aerials for the    
 Police and Thames Water Authority and 
 a covered reservoir. The population of
 about 500 is almost exclusively white 
 English and mainly professional. There
 are about 200 houses. Several people  
 have lived here all their lives. House
 prices keep most young people out. Few
 people retire into the area though    
 many stay here when they retire.      </content>
