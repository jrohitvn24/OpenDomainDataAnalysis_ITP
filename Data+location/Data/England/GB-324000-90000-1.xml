		<title>01  The Town of Seaton</title>
		<content>{ Seaton,}first inhabited by the       
 Romans is now a popular seaside       
 resort.It is twinned with Thury       
 Harcourt.Seaton has a population of   
 less than five thousand but this is   
 more than doubled in the summer.      
  On the east end of the promenade is  
 the River Axe beyond which are        
 cliffs on which there is a fine golf  
 course.At the west end of the beach is
 Seaton Hole.Here at the base of the   
 high white cliffs,which separates     
 Seaton from the village of Beer,are   
 many rock pools containing a lot of   
 marine life. From the beach can be    
 seen Portland Bill to the east, and to
 the South West you can follow the     
 coastline to Torbay.                  
   Close to Seaton are many places of  
 great interest.Bindon Manor in the    
 14th century is mentioned in the      
 Domesday Book.{(see page 9)  }        </content>
