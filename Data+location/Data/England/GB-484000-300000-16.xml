		<title>16Ridlington Church, Rutland</title>
		<content>   Ridlington church is situated in the
 central area of the village           
 overlooking a side of a hill. It is   
 the junction of two roads coming      
 together at the north side of the     
 church and the graveyard may be       
 entered by a small iron gate at that  
 corner. The church as it stands today 
 is very well looked after with        
 flowers and holly bushes at           
 the south entrance and the grass      
 surrounding some 200 graves is        
 frequently cut.But before the 1860's  
 there were{"large rents and fissures} 
{in the chancel,occasioned by a doorway
{having been cut in a reckless way in }
{the south wall."}In the year 1860     
 Henry Parsons ,a London architect,was 
 called in to advise and Halliday of   
 Greetham was employed to do the       
 restoration work.
