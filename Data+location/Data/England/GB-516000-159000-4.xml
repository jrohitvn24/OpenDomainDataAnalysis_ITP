		<content> Epsom Common is one of the many places
 you can go to see wildlife such as    
 birds and other animals. At the Stew  
 Ponds we found out it can get very    
 muddy even though attempts have been  
 made to separate the horse path from  
 the footpaths. We saw quite a few     
 Damsel flies around the Stew Ponds.We 
 also saw two grey squirrels as we     
 entered the woods.The main trees on   
 the common are the oak, the silver    
 birch and the ash.                    
                                       
 The common had lots of plants such as 
 Bracken,Thistles,Grannies Lace,Bull   
 Rushes and many more.                 
                                       
 There were lots of animals like       
 mice,rabbits.We saw some mole         
 hills as well.If you go to Epsom      
 common please don't drop litter.
