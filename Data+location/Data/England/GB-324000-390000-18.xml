		<title>18BIDSTON GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> We have 2 golf clubs in our area,     
 Leasowe and Bidston.I visited Bidston 
 and interviewed the greenkeeper.      
 Bidston Golf course is 72 years old,  
 but the Club House is modern being    
 only 4 years old.Mr.J.Law is the      
 manager and employs 10 people to run  
 the club.The club has approximately   
 400 members and there is a junior     
 section for 11-18 year olds.          
 Annual fees are Â£207,and visitors are 
 most welcome although prior booking is
 best at weekends.Sunday is busiest.   
 Course Details:

 The 16th. hole is an interesting Par 3

 Peers!)
