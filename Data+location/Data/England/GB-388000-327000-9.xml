		<content>   Every Wednesday and Saturday are    
 half-holidays.On these days boys have 
 tuck after lunch and school matches   
 may be played.Also on these days,boys 
 who have misbehaved are given tasks to
 do around the school.                 
   There are lots of major activities  
 during the school year.Apart from many
 matches played against othes schools  
 in the main games, there are cross    
 runs,chess ,computing,model making and
 gardening.Perhaps the climax of the   
 winter term are the carol services    
 held in Barlaston church and the      
 school chapel.At this time too. the   
 cast for the school play in rhe       
 following summer term is announced.   
   The play involves a large cast of   
 perhaps 50 boys,with another 10 or so 
 acting as stage hands or doing the    
 lighting.Mrs Carr,the headmaster's
