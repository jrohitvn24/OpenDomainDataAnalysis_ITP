		<title>17 Talking To Pig Farmers</title>
		<content>We visited a small pig farm along the  
A163 Market Weighton Road. A farm      
worker told us that there were over 100
pigs. Only a few go to slaughter. The  
farmer takes 1 or 2 to the cattle      
market at 14 weeks old. An average     
litter is 12 piglets. The pigs are fed 
on fish and barley. Further down the   
road at the Dutch Pig Farm, we asked   
similar questions. The farm has about  
60 piglets born and around the same    
number going to slaughter each week.   
The pigs are pure breed, large white,  
land race and cross breed. The oldest  
pig is an 8 year old sow. Farm         
machinery includes a Bob Cat tractor,  
slurry tanker, power washer and        
scraping machinery. A worker said he   
put a 40 hour week, plus overtime.     
Savage sows were a problem!
