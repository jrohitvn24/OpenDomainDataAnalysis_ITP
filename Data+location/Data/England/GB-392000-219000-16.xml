		<content>{Netball.}We like to play netball.You  
 have two teams and two goal posts.You 
 also have a ball.The object of the    
 game is to get the ball through the   
 top of the goal posts.The team that   
 scores the most goals are the winners.
 The goal posts have a circle at the   
 top that is joined onto a pole which  
 is on a stand.                        
{Football.}Football also has goal posts
 but they are different because they   
 are put together in an oblong shape.It
 is usually played by boys or men.They 
 have to kick the ball to another      
 player in the team,who tries to kick  
 the ball in the goal.The winners are  
 the team who have scored the most     
 goals.                                
{ Hopscotch.}In hopscotch there are    
 numbers drawn on the floor up to ten. 
 You throw a stone on a number then you
 hop up and down and pick up the stone.</content>
