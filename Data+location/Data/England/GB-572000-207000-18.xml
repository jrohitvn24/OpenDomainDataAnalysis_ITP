		<content> Our school,built in  1815 is the      
 oldest school building in Essex.It is 
 interesting and has red brick         
 walls,stone floors and a slate        
 roof.There are 3 stone plaques outside
 with most of the writing worn         
 away.There are 5 teachers,5           
 classrooms,120 children,an office ad a
 kitchen with lovely smells.There is no
 hall and the toilets are outside.Some 
 of our parents,grandparents and       
 great grandparents attended our       
 school.Our school is good because we  
 have clubs,gerbils,a computer,day     
 trips and field courses.Some of our   
 mums come in to help with reading,art 
 and craft.Outside we have a football  
 field,adventure playground and an air 
 raid shelter for sports equipment.We  
 are all looking forward to our new    
 school being built this year.
