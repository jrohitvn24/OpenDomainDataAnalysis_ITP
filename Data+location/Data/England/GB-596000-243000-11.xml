		<content>The area grows sugar beet, barley and  
oil seed rape.  The crops vary         
according to financial restraints or   
encouragements placed by the UK        
Government or the EEC.                 
Presently the brilliant yellow of oil  
seed rape has been encouraged and in   
that season fields are a blaze of      
colour in the sunshine.  Because of the
spraying of fields by spraying units   
with arms many metres in length, the   
tractor drivers sometimes miss bits and
there are red slashes of poppies across
the fields.                            
The seasons bring kaleidescopes of     
greens turning to gold.  Then the skies
are lit by the fires as the fields are 
burned off.  There is opposition to    
this on the grounds of wasted          
resources; also on the damage of fires 
which get out of hand, black smuts of  
which fly for miles.                   </content>
