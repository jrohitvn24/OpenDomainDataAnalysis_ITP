 which is around 350ft maximum         
 altitude.The eastern half of the block
 is mainly sea, with the coast running 
 NNE-SSW.The plateau is deeply         
 dissected by E-W running valleys.These
 valleys contain small brooks which run
 east to the coast.The coast itself is

 between Torcross and Bee Sands,and

 E-W in the north of the block.To the  
 centre of the block are some local    
 grits, called Beeson Grits.In the     
 south of the area are Hornblendic and
