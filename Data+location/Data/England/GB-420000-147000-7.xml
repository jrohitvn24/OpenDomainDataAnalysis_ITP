		<content>  Clothing today is made of natural    
 cotton,linen,silk and many synthetic  
 fabrics. Easy-care fabrics that wash  
 easily and need little or no ironing  
 are popular. Most people tend to dress
 well but this is governed by their    
 income. Clothes are bought from chain 
 stores and individual shops. We live  
 in a "fast-food" era and many         
 housewives buy ready-made and frozen  
 food which can be cooked easily.      
 Shopping for food is done in          
 self-service stores, the NAAFI being  
 our biggest. Prices are quite high and
 it would probably cost at least Â£40   
 per week to feed a family of four.    
 Homes in Tidworth have either gas or  
 electric cookers and microwave ovens  
 are increasingly popular. Furniture is
 of wood and fabric construction;      
 plastics are widely used. Dogs and    
 cats are popular pets.                </content>
