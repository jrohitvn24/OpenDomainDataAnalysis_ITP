		<content> The square is dominated by the mouth  
 of the River Deen. To the south the   
 land is mainly a golf course. The     
 coastal margin is open to the public  
 and is a haven for a number of rare   
 plants. At the mouth of the river is a
 run down boat yard and the Felixstowe 
 Yatch Club. the boats are stacked on  
 raised sea defences. Fresh fish is    
 sold from stalls in the boat yard. An 
 open ferry runs across the mouth of   
 the river during the summer. At the   
 mouth of the river, the land is       
 sheltered and provides a mooring place
 for private boats. To the north the   
 land is dominated by large open grain 
 fields. The land is very flat and     
 protected from flooding by            
 embankments. The RAF has a station at 
 Bawdsey Manor, 85 squadron is based   
 there. It is a bloodhound surface to  
 air missile station.                  </content>
