		<title>09ASHILL CHURCH OF ENGLAND</title>
		<content> The 700 year old St Nicholas Church is
 undergoing its first major alteration 
 for a century. The Mediaeval Chancel  
 screen has been extended to fill the  
 arch, and the whole glazed, to make   
 the chancel a separate Meeting room,  
 with the old vestry as a kitchen.     
 The communion table has been brought  
 forward in front of the screen on to a
 new platform in the Nave, together    
 with the original communion rails,    
 which are removable, to make space for
 mimes, plays, guitar &amp; recorder groups
 etc, at the monthly Family Service.   
 Congregations now average 30-40 and   
 100-160 at special Family Services.   
 About 30 boys and girls up to 11+     
 attend Sunday School, about 15 up to  
 14+ go to Pathfinder Bible Class, and 
 half a dozen older teenagers belong to
 Acorns group. The Annual budget is    
 Â£7,000 incl. Diocesan Quota of Â£3,500.</content>
