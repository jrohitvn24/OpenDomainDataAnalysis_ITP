		<content> THE CHILD OF 1985 by HELEN WILLOWS    
 MONDAY...ON A MONDAY I AM ALWAYS      
 SLEEPY.I GET UP ABOUT 8.00.I GO AS    
 FAST AS I CAN OUT OF BED AND INTO THE 
 BATHROOM.I PUT WATER INTO THE BASIN   
 AND HAVE A WASH,CLEAN MY TEETH AND GO 
 TO THE TOILET.I RUSH BACK INTO MY     
 BEDROOM TO GET DRESSED.NOW ITS ABOUT  
 8.20.I RUSH DOWN STAIRS AND HAVE MY   
 BREAKFAST.THEN ITS ABOUT 8.30.MY      
 SISTER SITS AT THE TABLE WAITING.MUM  
 SAYS HURRY UP HELEN.I PUT ON MY COAT, 
 GET MY BAGS AND GO OUT AND GET IN THE 
 CAR.BY THIS TIME IT IS ABOUT 8.40.WE  
 STOP AT THE SHOP AND GET SOME SWEETS. 
 THEN WE GO TO SCHOOL.NOW IT IS 8.55. I
 AM LATE BECAUSE I CAN NEVER MAKE UP MY
 MIND WHAT TO CHOOSE.BY THE TIME I GET 
 TO SCHOOL THE BELLS ALREADY HAVE RANG.
 SOMETIMES SOMEONE LETS ME IN THE LINE.
 WE ALL TAKE OUR COATS OFF AND GO INTO 
 THE CLASSROOM.                        </content>
