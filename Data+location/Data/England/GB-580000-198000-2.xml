		<title>02Charity Farm</title>
		<content>   {Charity farm}is owned by Mr. Cooper
 and is mainly an arable farm although 
 90 breeding ewes are kept near-by. The
 farm came by its name because it      
 belonged to a Charity Trust. The      
 profits were used to shoe children in 
 Boreham school and Little Baddow also.
    Nowadays the whole farm is worked  
 by 3 men and an 18 year old boy.The   
 farm comprises 208 acres, 60 acres of 
 wheat, 100 acres of oil seed rape with
 barley making up the rest. The hard   
 wheat is ground to make flour and the 
 soft wheat is used for animal fodder. 
    Beyond the house, which was rebuilt
 in 1803, lies two ponds.  One drains  
 to the River Crouch and the other to  
 the River Blackwater.                 
    The main enemies on the farm are   
 broom grass and a bug which burrows   
 into the rape pods. The crops are     
 sprayed 3 times a year to kill pests. </content>
