		<title>11My Special Place</title>
		<content> My special place is{Devils Water}There
 are tunnels in the water that I can go
 through.There are hundreds of wild    
 flowers, yellow,white,blue and red.   
 There is a pool where there are a lot 
 of fish. I go fishing there. I have   
 caught lots of fish, but they have got
 away.I go swimming there, and you can 
 play follow-my-leader in the water.   
 The last time I went, I saw two fish  
 jump. I usually go in the holidays    
 because after school we have work to  
 do on the farm.We can bike around at  
 Devils Water. There is interesting    
 wildlife there.                       
 We are not quite sure why it is called
 Devils Water. Some people say it is   
 named after the Norman family         
 d'Eiville,who were lords of the manor,
 others say  it is because the water   
 can look so black and frightening.
