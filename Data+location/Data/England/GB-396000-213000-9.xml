		<content> Mr Unwin does not keep sheep any more.
 He used to keep Clun forest sheep     
 because they were hardy sheep.So if   
 you bring them back from the Welsh    
 mountains and put them in good grass  
 they will have twins or triplets.He   
 kept sheep for their meat only because
 meat is worth more than wool.Meat is  
 worth Â£30 per carcase. He does not    
 keep animals any more because he is   
 growing crops instead.He thinks that  
 the wool trade has died because meat  
 is worth more than wool so wool is not
 so important.He used to keep sheep on 
 a field one year and then grow crops. 
 He used to do this to fertilise the   
 ground. But now there is no need to do
 this because fertilisers are cheaper  
 today also you don't need a shepherd  
 to look after crops.
