		<content>  The railway line which runs just east
 of Great Ponton is the main London to 
 Edingburgh route.There are two bridges
  that it traverses in our block,and   
 many embankments and cuttings needed  
 to keep the track level.              
   On June 5th.from 2.45pm. to 3.15pm. 
 three trains passed Great Ponton.They 
 were all Intercity 125's travelling at
 speeds of up to 80 mph. in this       
 stretch.It takes one hour 18 minutes  
 to get from London to Grantham        
 nowadays.                             
   The trains used to call at Great    
 Ponton, but the station closed in the 
 1960's as part of the Beeching cuts.  
 The old station building is now used  
 as a warehouse for storing equipment.
