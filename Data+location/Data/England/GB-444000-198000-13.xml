		<title>13 A DAY AT A PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     We visited Dry Sandford school and
 talked to 3 pupils who were 8 years   
old.Their favourite SUBJECTS are Maths 
and Topic.The classroom was one big    
area with 7 tables,square and          
hexagonal shape.They have 2 playtimes. 
     Sometimes they do cooking and     
sewing,which they all enjoy.There is an
outdoor swimming pool in the school and
we saw 21 pupils swimming,supervised by
a teacher.There are 7 teachers,one of  
whom has been teaching for 7           
years.During her career she has seen   
most changes in maths.The most         
important subjects in primary EDUCATION
are READING,WRITING and Maths.The      
Classroom has changed alot as now there
are changes instead of desks and the   
walls now are more colourful.
