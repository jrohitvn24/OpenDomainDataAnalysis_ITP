		<content>  In this rural community, most people 
 have a telephone to maintain contact  
 with friends and relatives. A local   
 newspaper, The Cotswold Standard,     
 published weekly, is redily available.
 Broadwell Post Office was previously  
 situated in a private house, the      
 village shop and the Fox Inn. The     
 present Post Office was originally the
 bottling store of the 300 year old    
 Quinmoor Farm. It is open 4 days a    
 week for stamps, postal orders,       
 pensions, sweets and cards as well as 
 chutneys and marmalades made by       
 villagers. Oddington Post Office has  
 been providing its service for 150    
 years. It is open 5 days a week with  
 Thursday being very busy as many      
 elderly people collect their pensions 
 then. Both Post Offices have one      
 delivery and two collections per day.
