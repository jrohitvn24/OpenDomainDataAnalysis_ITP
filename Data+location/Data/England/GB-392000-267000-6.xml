		<title>06CHILDREN'S GAMES, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content> We interviewed children aged three to 
 nine years of age, asking them about  
 their favourite games played in the   
 school playground and at home, both in
 the garden and indoors.               
   The favourite games overall were    
 chasing games of different kinds.     
 These were played in all the areas we 
 queried.Children of all ages enjoyed  
 riding bicycles;many children played  
 with "doll" figures.                  
   Playing indoors, board games and    
 construction toys were  very popular, 
 whilst out of doors, children chose to
 play on climbing equipment.           
 Imaginary games and ball games were   
 played by groups of children, whilst  
 other children preferred playing by   
 themselves with skipping ropes,       
 puzzles and computers.                
   In conclusion, no game appeared to  
 be exclusive to any age group or sex. </content>
