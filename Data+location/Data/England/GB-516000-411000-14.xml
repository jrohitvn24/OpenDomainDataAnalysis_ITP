		<content> Our vicar ministers to the churches of
 both Stallingborough and Healing      
 parishes.He has been a vicar at       
 Stallingborough for twenty years.When 
 he was seventeen he decided to be a   
 vicar because he felt God calling     
 him.He doesnt just take services.He   
 visits our school.Also he is          
 responsible for all the people in the 
 parish and helps them with their      
 problems.They can see him at any time 
 and he can have up to forty calls a   
 day!He listens to peoples problems and
 advises them in strict confidence.He  
 holds services at both churches and   
 more people go than you would         
 expect.He enjoys doing weddings and   
 baptisms because he can share  in     
 peoples joy.One thing the vicar does  
 not like it if anybody is late but    
 generally he enjoys being a vicar.He  
 says he wouldnt do any other job.     </content>
