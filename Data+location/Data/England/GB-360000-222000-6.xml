		<content> 3 fee-paying car parks exist in the   
 town.One other exists in Cantilupe Rd 
 but is due to close later in l985 for 
 the new library to be constructed. A  
 survey showed l3 people would park in 
 the car park,against 9 on the restric-
 ted road areas. 3 garages exist in the
 area; all carrying out servicing &amp;    
 sales,but only 2 offering petrol fac- 
 ilities. Only one carries out agricul-
 tural repairs and sales.Road haulage  
 is an important factor in Ross since  
 it no longer has the railway to carry 
 goods from the town. Littlewoods have 
 8-9 articulated lorries, all fitted   
 with tacographs. The coal depot relies
 on lorries to collect up to 425 tons  
 of coal from South Wales every two    
 weeks, in 23 ton loads; this is then  
 redistributed to local areas.
