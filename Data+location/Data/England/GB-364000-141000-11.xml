		<title>11VILLAGE HALLS.</title>
		<content>{Doulting and Cranmore}each have a     
 village hall where villagers can hold 
 functions such as{dances, badminton,  
{wedding receptions, Harvest Suppers   
 and{meetings.}The hall at Doulting is 
 new because it is the new school hall.
 The school uses it during lesson times
 and after school the village use it.  
 The village finished an extension in  
 1985 which has a bar, coat rails and a
 carpet in. The people can also use the
 school kitchen where our school       
 dinners are cooked. At Cranmore their 
 hall is older and smaller. It has got 
 a wooden floor and a partition which  
 divides the room into two. At Doulting
 the committee have built a large car  
 park which can be used for{tennis}and 
 a school play-ground. At Cranmore     
 there are some prints by the{artist   
 and{painter David Shepherd}and signed 
 by him.                               </content>
