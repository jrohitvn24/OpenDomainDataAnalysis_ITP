		<content> The worst problem in port isaac is    
 transport,becase there is hardly any  
 public transport,like trains or bus's 
 and every thing is so for away.The    
 results of a questionaire sampling    
 people of different ages showed       
 that all ages seem to watch the       
 telivision and listen to the          
 radio.The younger ones like to listen 
 to the radio,and the older ones did   
 quite a lot of walking.Most people    
 would like a cinema and swimming pool,
 an ice skating rink and roller stating
 rink They also would like a tennis    
 court.Although there are not many     
 activities provided there is the      
 swimming,fishing,sailing and the nice 
 country walking,and so the younger    
 ones can find plenty to do in the     
 summer.
