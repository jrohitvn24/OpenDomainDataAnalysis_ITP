		<content>    To the south-west of Holcot village
 the land is mainly devoted to         
 agriculture.                          
    The largest farming unit is based  
 at Moulton Lodge and is worked by     
{Mr.David Watson,}who has rented it    
 since 1971.                           
    The farmhouse at{Moulton Lodge}was 
 built on undulating land in 1749 from 
 stone quarried in an adjacent field.  
    Moulton Lodge Farm covers 115 acres
 and is worked in conjunction with     
{North Farm,}145 acres, and the rented 
{Manor Farm,}230 acres, to form        
{Bestlands Farms.}                     
     The other main centres for farming
 in the area are at{Tithe Farm,}one    
 kilometre south of Holcot village, and
 at{Moulton Grange Farm}on the south   
 shore of Pitsford Reservoir.          
     The farming is{mainly arable}with 
 only a few livestock being kept.      </content>
