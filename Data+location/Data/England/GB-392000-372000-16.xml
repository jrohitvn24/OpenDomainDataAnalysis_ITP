		<title>16RECREATION OF A 1st YR BOY</title>
		<content> I am not particularly good at ordinary
 school sports but I feel that I am    
 above average at the more unusual     
 sports.Here are some examples of my   
 hobbies and interests.                
 CLUBS.I attend the Wednesday Club an  
 informal school youth club and outside
 school I am a member of Scouts Watch(a
 nature club) and Followers a church   
 youth club.                           
 HIKE CAMPING.Is my favourite outdoor  
 sport.You need stamina and the right  
 equipment which has to be carried in a
 ruck sack.I carry a 30 to 40 pound    
 pack.                                 
 CRAFTS.My main craft is               
 aero-modelling.It is rewarding but    
 difficult &amp; expensive.The small but   
 effective freeflight plane powered by 
 a small diesel engine could cost Â£25.
