		<content>   Mr Wykes remembers a brickyard at   
 the bottom of Gold Street and the     
 village blacksmith. He recalls that   
 there was a saw mill in Vicarage Lane 
 and a flax mill in Gold Street.       
 Towards Farndish there were some sand-
 pits and on Wymington Road a lime     
 kiln.  There was everything needed for
 building houses.  Stones for building 
 were obtained from the stone pits.    
   Lace making here goes back about 200
 years.  There was once a lace school. 
 Now younger people are beginning to   
 take an interest in the craft.  There 
 was also a boot and shoe industry in  
 the village.  A doctor held a weekly  
 surgery in the village and a trained  
 nurse had a cottage in the village.   
   Alas these crafts, industries and   
 services have now disappeared.
