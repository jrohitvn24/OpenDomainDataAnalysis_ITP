		<content>    This farm belongs to the           
 Rothamstead Experimental Station and  
 is used for experiments as well as    
 commercial farming.                   
    It is mainly used for crop         
 experiments and in our section of the 
 farm our experiments with fertilizers 
 and pesticides.  The farm has its own 
 bore hole in the chalk aquifer and    
 uses the water for irrigation.        
    The main laboratories and farm     
 buildings are found outside our       
 section as are the original           
 experiments by John Bennet Lawes the  
 founder of the research station in the
 mid nineteenth century.
