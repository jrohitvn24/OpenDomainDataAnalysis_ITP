		<title>16ST.EDMUNDS CHURCH - HARGRAVE</title>
		<content>The Rector Rev. C. Kevill-Davies is    
shared with three other parishes. The  
first Sunday in the month a Family     
Service is shared with the Methodist   
Chapel in the village. The congretation
is mostly elderly folk, the services in
recent years being held in the Chancel 
as the everage attendance is 10. When I
came to Hargrave someone, who had lived
there for 17 years asked if the Church 
was used. It is difficult to face the  
future with any degree of optimism when
a stewardship campaign some years ago  
proved very disappointing the only     
people who gave were those who already 
supported the Church BUT a small       
minority of churchgoers seem gripped by
dogged determination to continue the   
tradition of whorship in their church  
faithful to the tremendous burden      
placed on them by care of such a large 
building, quite outgrown its purpose.  </content>
