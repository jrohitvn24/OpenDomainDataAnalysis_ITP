 Gymnasium, Sports Hall and floodlit

 centre offers a wide range of         
 activities which range from judo and  
 karate to snooker and aerobics. These

 what sports they did outside schooland
 what sports they watched. 80% of them 
 take part in sports, the most popular 
 being football and cricket.
