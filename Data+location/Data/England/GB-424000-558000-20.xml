		<content> I think we have quite a lot of{clinics
 and{hospitals}in the area but I would 
 like to see them better equipped. My  
 local{doctor}is very understanding but
 I don't like my{dentist!              
 The{police}here are very friendly and 
 helpfull, as all policemen should be. 
{ Gateshead Stadium}is of great use to 
 the people of the North East and isn't
 far away. It has attracted many top   
 athletes.                             
 I enjoy shopping, despite the absence 
 of a large area of shops like the one 
 in Newcastle({ELDON SQUARE})          
 I would love the buses to run on time!
 And I would like to see the Metro     
 extended to Low Fell. Bicycle lanes   
 would reduce the number of accidents  
 dramatically.
