{CHILDREN}- The children have no youth 
 or recreational facilities.They ride  
 on their bicycles round the village.  
                                       
{ADULTS}- The adults are interested in 
 gardening. There is an annual         
 Wychavon village games.The adults     
 have to leave the village for all     
 sports. Some of the people go to      
 Evesham and Pershore rowing           
 clubs, squash courts and tennis       
 clubs. Barn dances are held in the    
 village tithe barn but the local      
 residents dont attend. They are       
 organised by people outside the       
 village.
