		<content> The foundations for a house are 60    
 cm deep. They use J.C.B. 3c diggers to
 dig them.                             
   The floor are made out of precast   
 concrete beams and blocks and timber  
 sheets. The precast concrete beams are
 shaped like an upside down "T". All of
 the upside down "T" are placed side by
 side and in the middle of them are    
 breeze blocks. Then to finish off     
 they place down timber sheets for the 
 bricks. The inside wall is made of    
 crushed concrete blocks and the       
 insulation in the wall is a 5cm gap.  
 The roof insulation is bits of strands
 of fibre. The windows are made of soft
 pine wood and are stained on site.
