		<title>05COGENHOE CRICKET CLUB.</title>
		<content>   In the past Cogenhoe cricketers     
 played their games in neighbouring cow
 fields and on bare ironstone.         
   In{1951 the pavilion was opened}and 
 in 1982, the cricket club celebrated  
 its{100th anniversary.}Perhaps  the   
 most famous member of the club was    
 George J.{Thompson.}In 1894 at the age
 of 16 he took 8 wickets for 0 runs    
 against local rivals Billing. In 1906 
 he was one of{Wisden's}5 "Cricketers  
 of the Year". Since then other        
 stalwarts have been and gone. Jack    
 Notton for instance, took 111 wickets 
 in 1921 and the Rev. A. W. Sale was   
 club Captain in the early 1930's.     
   The Club's proudest possession is an
 exercise book recording the clubs'    
 annual meetings, 1910_1975. For       
 instance in 1920 2 games were         
 abandoned because the teams were      
 hard up and{couldn't afford the fare. </content>
