		<title>11Local History in Yewdale 2</title>
		<content>    Our local history is associated    
 very strongly with agricultural       
 development, as well as the mining    
 mentioned on P 10. The remarkable fact
 is that many of our ancestors would be
 familiar with the present ways of     
 farming. Sheep grazing on open fells  
 are an aspect of hill farming that    
 cannot readily be changed whatever the
 new developments may be. The impact of
 this grazing over many centuries,     
 coupled with the extensive felling of 
 trees for charcoal, has made the upper
 fells largely bare of trees, and      
 has encouraged the growth of bracken. 
    Farmers who can flourish in such a 
 harsh environment have always been    
 sturdily independent, and such men,   
 with their individual approach and    
 'feel' for the land, gave rise to the 
{'statesmen'}- the Cumbrian equivalent 
 of the yeoman farmers.                </content>
