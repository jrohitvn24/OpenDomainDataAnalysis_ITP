		<title>08GOXHILL HALL &amp; PRIORY CONT.</title>
		<content> Once the Graham's took over the       
 properties their first requirement was
 to put a modern kitchen into the Hall.
 They later re-roofed the Hall and have
 conserved the timber panelling of the 
 rooms. As architects they are         
 interested in the history of the      
 properties and found evidence of      
 earlier building when the hall's      
 floorboards were lifted. They also    
 re-excavated much of the moat around  
 the Priory. The moat is water filled  
 and entry to the front of the Hall is 
 by a footbridge. Modern materials have
 been used in the restoration of the   
 Hall and Priory but the Graham's have 
 also used old second hand bricks. They
 built a garage entirely from bricks   
 found in the Hall's grounds and in the
 spoil from the moat's re-excavation.  
 Very few people have a Fortified Manor
 House in their garden!!               </content>
