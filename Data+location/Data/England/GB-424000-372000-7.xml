		<content>      After playing cricket in the     
 yard, the first afternoon lesson is   
 Craft. I am enjoying weaving. At      
 playtime I change into a policeman's  
 uniform for my part in the school play
 which is to be rehearsed.             
                                       
      When school is over at 3.30, I   
 wait for my Mum to drive me home, when
 I have a drink of tea. I play with the
 dog before Dad comes home from Maltby 
 market where he has a refrigerated    
 butcher's shop. I help Dad wash trays 
 and make beef-burgers.                
                                       
      When we have had tea, I help Dad 
 feed the bulls, the Limousan heifers  
 and the horse. After that I have a    
 bath and watch television before going
 to my comfortable bed.                
                                       
                                       </content>
