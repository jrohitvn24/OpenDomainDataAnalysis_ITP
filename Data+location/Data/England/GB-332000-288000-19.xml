		<content>   There are various styles of houses  
 in Bishops Castle.Many in the main    
 street have not changed in over a     
 hundred years.                        
                                       
    Many of them are three storeys high
  together with a cellar.Years ago     
 these were built so big because of the
 need for servants quarters.           
                                       
 One of the oldest buildings is        
 called the "House on Stilts" which was
 built in the time of King Henry       
 V111.It is made from timber and stands
 high above the street on wooden       
 stilts.                               
                                       
     Another prominent building in the 
 town is the Porch House.This is a     
 large building also with a timber     
 frame and built at about the same     
 time.                                 </content>
