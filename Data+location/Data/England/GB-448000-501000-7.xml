 Yorkshire Moors National Park Planning
 Authority is the ruling body within   
 the Park boundary, ie, south of the

 an annual parish meeting. Councils    
 deal with planning matters, public

 village services. These include weekly
 refuse collection, upkeep of highways 
 and verges, and local sewage disosal  
 (some houses still have septic tanks).

 provides supplies from hill springs   
 and is responsible for Faceby Beck.   
{The North Eastern Electricity Board}  
 provides power. There is no domestic  
 gas supply but the high-pressure main 
 passes just north of the area. There  
 is no resident{policeman.}            </content>
