		<title>16   The Whitegate Way</title>
		<content>    The Whitegate Way is a dismantled  
 railway that ran from the salt mine in
 Winsford to Chester were it joined on 
 to the main line.                     
    It was used to carry salt from the 
 mines without being delayed. The      
 Whitegate Way was finally dismantled  
 when the bridge, now known as The     
 Broken Bridge, became unsafe and had  
 to be pulled down,although it had     
 already been abandoned.               
    Whitegate Way is now used as a     
 nature walk and,in parts,as a bridle  
 path.                                 
    Along the Whitegate Way a variety  
 of trees,wild flowers,birds and       
 insects can be observed.Whitegate Way 
 provides a pleasant afternoon walk.
