 there used to be the old railway      
 station. The{railway}was the busiest  
 during the last war. There are six    
 factories on the estate being{Paul    
{Nevils, John Whites, V.W.Graphics.    
 There is also an{Upholsterer, Tony    
{Duros}and a firm for{motor cycle      
{parts.}There are still signs of the   
 railway on the estate and they are the
 station house and some buildings. The 
 biggest factory on the estate is John 
 Whites. John Whites was on the railway
 before it closed and the factory used 
 to process potatoes. The estate has   
 been there twelve years but it wasn't 
 built till about two or three years   
 after the railway had closed. There   
 used to be a{goods yard}on the estate 
 and it was the only building destroyed
 by a German bomb during the Second    
 World War.                            </content>
