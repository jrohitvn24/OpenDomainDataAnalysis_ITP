		<title>10LANDSCAPE - THE LAKES</title>
		<content> The lakes called Brooklands are old   
gravel workings which have been flooded
to provide a recreational area for a   
variety of interests.                  
 A number of paths provide a walk      
around these lakes which is an         
ecologists delight AND nightmare, for  
along with a variety of wild life and  
plant life there is also plenty of     
evidence of mans carelessness in the   
form of rubbish and general vandalism. 
At one point effluent enters the lakes 
from the nearby industrial estate.     
  For anglers the lakes provide plenty 
of fish and endless hours of interest. 
Permits are required and competitions  
are often held.                        
  Local sea-cadets have their centre   
beside the lakes and a section gives   
them an area for water training.
