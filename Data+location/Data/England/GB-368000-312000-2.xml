 relatively new and unfinished and is  
 situated on an extensive level site in
 Trench.This was formerly farmland.The 
 industrial units are surrounded by    
 grassland which borders the rural area
 known as Horton.                      
    It is served by good road links to 
 other parts of Telford,the A442 to    
 Chester and Whitchurch,and the M54 to 
 the West Midlands.                    
    At present,there are three large   
 industrial units - a polythene and    
 paper packaging plant,a brass founders
 and an icecream manufacturer and      
 frozen food wholesalers.

 concerned with light industrial manu- 
 facture or warehousing.An example is  
 Martin Industrial Ltd. which makes    
 robots and robot components.This is a 
 relativey new industry for Telford.   </content>
