		<content>   The{de Carterets}are a very         
 important{royalist}Jersey family.     
 They have played a large part in the  
 history of Jersey, the English        
 Monarchy and the founding of New      
 Jersey in America.                    
   Sir Edouard de Carteret (d.l698) was
 the first{Black Rod}to knock on and   
 open the doors of the U.K. Parliament 
 when it reassembled after the{Civil   
{War.} He later returned to Jersey and 
 became{Bailiff.}                      
   Legend has it that, when he died his
 body was being taken to St.{Ouen's    
{Church}by horse and cart. A storm made
 the horses bolt and, unable to        
 continue the journey, he was buried in
 the Lady Chapel of{Trinity Church.}
