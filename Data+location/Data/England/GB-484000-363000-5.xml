		<title>05Local History  Eagle Hall</title>
		<content> Eagle Hall is one mile south west of  
 Eagle village.It comprises of one     
 thousand acres of land including one  
 hundred and thirty acres of woods and 
 plantations.The old hall,with a great 
 part of the land,once belonged to     
 Henry Nevile,Esq.Adjoining it is      
 another estate called Eagle           
 Woodhouse.Both of these were the      
 property of a commandery of Knights   
 Templar founded by King Stephen and   
 afterwards given to the Knights       
 Hospitallers of St.John of Jerusalem, 
 but dissolved in 1541.The monastery   
 stood near Eagle Hall where its sight 
 is still distinguishable by the       
 remains of large banks and ditches.   
 There was once a moat round Eagle Hall
 and there are stories of secret       
 passages leading from the hall to     
 Eagle church.Today both Eagle Hall and
 Eagle Woodhouse are farmed.           </content>
