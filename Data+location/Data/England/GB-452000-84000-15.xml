		<title>15GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content>      This is a game I love to play.   
 You play it outside.  It is called    
 B.M.Xing.  You have to have a bike    
 called a B.M.X.  You can do what is   
 called freestyle B.M.Xing.  You need a
 special B.M.X. helmet which has       
 padding on the inside.  One stunt     
 which you can do is what most people  
 call a wheelie.  A wheelie is when you
 pull on the handle bars and at the    
 same moment press the pedal down and  
 you should find that your front wheel 
 goes up.  Another stunt which you can 
 do on a B.M.X. is what you call an    
 endo.  An endo is similar to a        
 wheelie.  When you do an endo you     
 should pull the brake very hard.  They
 should be very good brakes and if you 
 put enough weight onto the front of   
 your bike you should find that your   
 back wheel goes up.
