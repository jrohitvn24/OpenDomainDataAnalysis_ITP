		<content> EVERY NIGHT I PUT ON MY NIGHTIE,CLEAN 
 MY TEETH AND GO TO BED.IN THE MORNING 
 I DRESS,HAVE MY BREAKFAST,POLISH MY   
 SHOES,BRUSH MY HAIR AND TIE IT UP.    
 ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL I CROSS A ROAD   
 NEAR A FIELD WHERE THERE IS A SHETLAND
 PONY.BEFORE I CROSS I LOOK AND LISTEN 
 TO MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE.WHEN I GET TO 
 SCHOOL I GO INTO THE CLASS ROOM.I     
 GET OUT MY SPELLING BOOK AND WRITE MY 
 SPELLINGS DOWN.WE HAVE ASSEMBLY WHEN  
 WE SING HYMNS AND PRAY.IN CLASS I GET 
 MY MATHEMATICS BOOK AND WORK IN IT    
 UNTIL PLAYTIME.ON MONDAY WE WATCH     
 TELEVISION AND WRITE ABOUT IT.SOON IT 
 IS LUNCH TIME WHEN MRS.JAMES AND MRS. 
 MOSCROP LOOK AFTER US.IN THE AFTERNOON
 WE WRITE STORIES,READ AND PAINT AND   
 FINISH BY SWIMMING IN THE SCHOOL POOL.
