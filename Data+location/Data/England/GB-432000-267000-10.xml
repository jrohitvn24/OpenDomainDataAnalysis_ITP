		<title>10NEW HOMES FROM OLD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Lillington's old Victorian school   
 building has been given a new lease of
 life. For generations its five class  
 rooms, and tiny upstairs flat for the 
 teacher, served the community. Now,   
 standing a mere hundred yards from the
 new Middle and First Schools, its     
 future looked bleak when the last     
 children moved out just two years ago.
   A transformation has taken place!   
 Roofs have been repaired. Old windows 
 have been replaced, partition walls   
 erected and new doorways have been    
 made. Kitchens have been equipped and 
 central heating installed. The        
 primitive outside toilets have been   
 demolished and builders have laboured 
 on the deserted playground.           
   The result? Fourteen new homes ideal
 for newly weds or old couples, and a  
 building full of character and local  
 history saved for the future.         </content>
