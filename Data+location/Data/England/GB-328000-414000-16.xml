		<title>16A POLICEMAN ON UNEMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> I interviewed a policeman who has     
 served in the Merseyside Police Force 
 for ten years.I asked him what he     
 thought about the employment situation
 and what could be done to create more 
 jobs.He said "The government should   
 encourage wives to stay at home or    
 help with voluntary aid,for example   
 the elderly.This could be achieved by 
 a tax allowance for the working       
 husband.This would then enable jobs to
 be found for the young and unemployed.
 The government should also create     
 public work schemes,for example the   
 rebuilding of the Victorian sewers    
 which are falling apart,and the repair
 of roads.This could create further    
 problems in the short term because of 
 the added cost of paying the extra    
 workers recruited but eventually these
 costs will be met by the reduction in 
 the unemployment benefits".           </content>
