		<title>10FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> The farms seem to be of two types,    
 those that appear to have changed     
 little over the last hundred years and
 those that have been bought by people 
 originally from outside the area and  
 modernised.                           
 The older farms are generally small,  
 less than 100 acres and occupied by   
 one or more elderly people while the  
 others are larger, being a combination
 of land bought from a number of       
 smaller farms.                        
 We saw evidence of natural            
 fertilisation of the fields by the    
 traditional 'muck spreader', flinging 
 muck out as we passed.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
