		<title>20 BICTON ARENA by V.ROBERTS</title>
		<content>Tha Arena occupies a large area beside 
Bicton Gardens and is used about 12    
times a year for equestrian events.I   
competed on about 10 occasions in 1984 
on a dappled grey called SEFTON.I am   
now too old to enter Show Pony classes 
but still exercise Sefton &amp; watch him  
being ridden.Looking after &amp; riding    
Sefton from the farm where he is       
stabled is one of my main interests.   
Four of the Arena Shows each year are  
organised by the{South West Show       
Jumping Club}&amp; these attract big names 
like Harvey Smith &amp; David Broome.      
Such events are the most pulicised     
but Hunter Trials &amp; 3-Day Events are   
also held. Half the Arena is a cross   
country course and the rest is the     
Main Arena with seating,other rings &amp;  
temporary stables.
