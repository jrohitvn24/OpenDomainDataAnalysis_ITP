		<content>{Nailstone}is situated about three     
 kilometres south of Ibstock and four  
 kilometres north of Market Bosworth.  
 Nailstone stands about 450 feet above 
 sea level with the land sloping away  
 gently to three sides. To the north   
 east the land slopes gradually upwards
 to join the Charnwood Range. The      
 village borders the A447 which was    
 once the main road south to London.   
 There are 349 adults on the 1984      
 electoral role in Nailstone, whereas  
 there were 179 adults in the village  
 in 1851 out of a total of{population} 
 of 343.{                              
{First settlement}of the area was      
 probably between 650 and 750 A.D.     
 This would have been on the village   
 green which can still be seen as the  
 area around the church which is       
 enclosed by roads, and otherwise only 
 houses the more modern buildings.     </content>
