   The village pond was thoroughly     
cleaned out during the summer by a     
team of Haverhill youths working under 
the direction of the Youth Training    
Opportunities scheme.                  
   They created a small island in the  
middle and shaped the bed so that      
this  island might always be           
surrounded by water.                   
  It will be necessary to wait until   
winter to check the water level before 
work can be completed.Hopefully this   
will become an attractive feature of   
the village.                           
  The village was placed 2nd in the    
"Best Kept Village"competition         
organised by Suffolk Community Council.
