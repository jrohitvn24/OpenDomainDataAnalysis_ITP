		<content> Most people come from India,Pakistan  
 and Bangladesh.It is called the Common
 wealth. It smelt of Asian things,     
 spices, herbs and curries.The women   
 mainly wore Saris but sone wore the   
 sort of dress we wear.We passed       
 Temples which had a faint sound of    
 Indian music.Most of the people spoke 
 in their own language but some could  
 speak both their own and ours.        
 Most of the shops were General Stores 
 and Video shops.There were lots of    
 restaurants smelling of curry. There  
 were lots of cars lined up along      
 the roads. There were long rows of    
 Terraces and some very small          
 Maisonettes.None had garages.The      
 houses were not looked after very     
 well.All the paint was peeling off    
 window ledges and doors. The gardens  
 were messy and the net curtains dirty 
 and old. By Yvonne Sells.             </content>
