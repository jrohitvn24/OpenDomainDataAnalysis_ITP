		<title>14Foxley Grove Nursing Home.</title>
		<content> This is the only nursing home in our  
 area and was opened two years ago.    
 There are{15 patients,}none of whom   
 were born locally.They came from Eton,
 Windsor and Staines and other places  
 as far away as Devon and Kent.They are
 all there for{medical reasons.}One of 
 them is blind but she enjoyed talking 
 to us and was very interesting.Some of
 the patients had wheelchairs to get   
 around.The home has a big garden which
 can be seen from many of the rooms.The
{doctor}comes once a week unless called
 out specially and a{physiotherapist}is
 there 3 days a week.The ladies like   
 having the{hairdresser}who calls once 
 a fortnight.A{dentist}comes regularly 
 for check-ups or treatment.The mobile 
 library is round every 3 weeks and    
 brings big print books and tapes.The  
 patients only occasionally get out and
 about so they enjoy having visitors.  </content>
