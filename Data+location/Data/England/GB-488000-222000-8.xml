		<title>08The Local Sand Industry</title>
		<content>    Sand has been quarried around      
 Leighton Buzzard regularly since about
 1579. The canal &amp; the railway have    
 played a great part in transporting   
 goods, but now road transport is used.
 Sand was dug by hand until the 1930s, 
 but now work is mechanised. The sand  
 boom came in the Great War when       
 quarries were told to double their    
 capacity. Leighton Buzzard sand is a  
 high quality sharp &amp; silica sand &amp; the
 British Standard Specification is     
 based on a Heath &amp; Reach pit's        
 samples. The sand contains 99% pure   
 silica &amp; there are 70 different shades
 round here. Sand is excavated by      
 mechanical digger, mixed with water &amp; 
 pumped into a tower. The water drains 
 through overnight,runs away &amp; the sand
 is left in the tower. Then lorries    
 come &amp; take it. An exhausted pit must 
 be filled with 14ft of water.         </content>
