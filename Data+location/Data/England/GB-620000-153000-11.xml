		<title>11Adisham: Work and Housing</title>
		<content>  Adisham has become a dormitory over  
the last twenty years or so. Small     
cottages have been modernised and new  
houses infill many of the open spaces. 
Such houses are centrally heated by    
gas or electricity; a few by oil and   
two have solar panels. Most have       
telephones. Many council houses are    
privately owned.  There is a high      
proportion of professional people,     
especially scholastic, who commute to  
nearby towns for work, particularly to 
Canterbury schools and university.     
Some miners are employed at Snowdown   
Colliery. Farms employ two to four     
labourers now as against a dozen       
previously. Most villagers travel out- 
side the area to work while local jobs 
are filled by people coming in from    
surrounding villages. Labour relations 
are extremely good where staff are     
employed locally.                      </content>
