		<title>01The Survey Area.</title>
		<content> The 12sq km block of this survey has  
 no has major settlement. It includes  
 the few houses of High Flats and Lower
 Denby. The villages of Birds Edge,    
 Upper Denby and Ingbirchworth. Most   
 people travel to Penistone, Denby     
 Dale, Huddersfield or Barnsley for the
 services they need. The population of 
 the area is about 1600. The land rises
 from about 800ft to over 1100 and is  
 mostly used for agriculture. The 12sq 
 km area is interesting because it is  
 divided almost equally on a line north
 west to south east by the A629        
 Huddersfield to Sheffield road. Only a
 few farms are found to the south of   
 this road. The other division east to 
 west is between West Yorkshire        
 (Kirklees) and South Yorkshire        
 (Barnsley). Only one village          
 Ingbirchworth is in South Yorkshire.
