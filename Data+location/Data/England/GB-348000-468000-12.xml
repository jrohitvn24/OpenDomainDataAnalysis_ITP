		<title>12The Railway-Bolton-le-Sands</title>
		<content> The railway has electric wires for    
 electric trains.  However, many diesel
 trains also use the line.  The lines  
 go in a north/south direction.  There 
 are supports holding six  electric    
 wires.  Each support has numbers on   
 it.   There is a tunnel for road      
{transport}to go through under the     
 railway and the lines go over the top.
  The embankment is about three metres 
 high.  On one side of the line there  
 are hawthorn bushes and on the other  
 there are brambles.  At the foot of   
 the embankment there is a stream.     
 Next to the stream there are gardens  
 of the nearby bungalows. At the       
 southern end there are some caravans  
 on one side and houses on the other.  
 There are some signals close to the   
 houses.
