 on Friday before we go home.We have a 
 little garden and grow daffodils in   
 it.We have a playing field next to our
 school.All the children of the village
 come and play rounders and football on
 it.My favourite subject in the class  
 is Peak Maths.I live in Winster and on
 the way to school pass the Market     
 House.It takes me five to ten minutes
