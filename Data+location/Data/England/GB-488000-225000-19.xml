		<content> The Linslade/Soulbury area was plunged
 into the news in 1984 when a dangerous
 criminal nicknamed "The Fox"          
 terrorised the area. He wore a        
 balaclava so little description of him
 could be given. He started by breaking
 into local homes and stealing but soon
 escalated his activities by shooting  
 owners of the houses when disturbed.  
 He went on to rape several women. This
 caused absolute panic.                
 Helicopters and extra police were     
 drafted into the area. Local Do-It-   
 Yourself shops sold out of security   
 locks, alarms and safety devices and  
 people were warned not to leave any   
 windows open.The Fox was finally      
 captured in London.                   
 In 1985 the National Westminster Bank 
 was robbed of Â£100,000 by men dressed 
 as security guards. No-one was hurt.
