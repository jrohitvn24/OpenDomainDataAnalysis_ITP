		<title>11CRICKET AT SPETISBURY</title>
		<content> Prior to 1934 cricket and soccer had  
 been played in fields within and      
 adjoining the "Crawford Castle" hill  
 fort.  Mr Tory (father of the present 
 owner) created a village sportsfield  
 "The Meadows" on an island in the     
 River Stour.  Marle, special soil for 
 the cricket square, was brought by    
 rail from Nottingham to Blandford then
 by horse and cart to Spetisbury.  The 
 ground fell into disuse in the 195O's,
 but in 1967 cricket was restarted by a
 group of villagers.  Improvements made
 include the erection of a pavillion in
 1977.  The club now has over 3O       
 members and cricket is played on      
 Saturdays and Sundays throughout the  
 summer.  Many of the matches are      
 against neighbouring villages and     
 feature the atmosphere of friendly    
 village rivallry.
