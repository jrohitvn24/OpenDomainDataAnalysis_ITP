		<content>{H. H. Collins of Broadway}was founded 
 in 1900. It is a limited company, the 
 directors belonging to the Collins and
 Knight families. There are 60 full    
 time staff who manufacture fresh pork 
 products for a prestige market, e.g.  
{Harrods of London,}as well as for     
 local outlets. A large consignment of 
 York Hams was recently exported to the
 Sudan. The pork is obtained from      
 animals slaughtered on the premises,  
 and the pastry used in their pies is  
 hand raised following a thousand      
 years'old tradition.The smallest pie  
 produced weighs a quarter of a        
 pound.The largest is a yard long      
 weighing 15lb. The more exotic        
 products are Turkey, Ham and Cranberry
 Pie, Chicken, Chestnut and Red Wine   
 Pie, and the latest venture 'Stow Pie'
 (diced beef &amp; venison in a rich       
 Burgundy sauce).                      </content>
