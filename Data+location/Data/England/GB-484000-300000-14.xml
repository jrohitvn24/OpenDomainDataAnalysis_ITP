 Ridlington, Preston and Ayston are    
 located in a rural, undeveloped area  
 of Leicestershire with easy access to 
 leisure activities such as            
 fishing,sailing and walking.There are 
 good  commuting  possibilities for    
 Leicester and Peterbough.The villages 
 contain a mixture of older ironstone  
 houses and more modern council houses 
 The older ,more traditional houses in 
 the villages seem to be in greater    
 demand and tend to fetch higher       
 prices.The following are some examples
 of houses on the market in May 1985:  
 in   Ridlington a detached,three      
 bedroomed house cost Â£48,750,while a  
 rebuilt  seventeenth century three    
 bedroomed  house cost Â£85,000.
