		<title>06Transport in West Enfield</title>
		<content>  The main ways of travelling are by   
 tube train,bus,taxi and private car.  
 The one tube station in our area is   
 Oakwood on the Piccadilly line which  
 goes to the centre of London.All bus  
 services are local.Oakwood grew up    
 around Enfield West tube station which
 is now called Oakwood.It is still an  
 important station but most people who 
 live in our area prefer to travel by  
 car.The average journey to work is    
 8-10 miles and is usually to London.  
   The majority of people in Oakwood   
 own at least one if not two cars.     
 People state the reasons for choosing 
 a particular form of travel as        
 cost,speed and convenience.At work    
 people park in the street or firm's   
 carpark whilst at home they park in   
 their garage or drive.Although many   
 people use public transport everyday  
 most use it very rarely.              </content>
