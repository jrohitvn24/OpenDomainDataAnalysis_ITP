		<title>12THE PONTELAND BYPASS</title>
		<content> For fifty years a{bypass}has been     
 proposed for Ponteland.Improvements   
 have been made but the conditions on  
 the{A696}are highly unsatisfactory.The
{Department of Transport}has considered
 two routes. The D.O.T. preferred the  
 route that crossed Ponteland golf     
 course,severing the club house from a 
 major part of the course and would cut
{Eland Hall}off from Ponteland on the  
 south side.It would also be very close
 to the houses on Eland Green,The Green
 and Pont View.The route preferred by  
 the local council (estimated to be    
 6% more expensive and slightly longer)
 would at least move the line of the   
 road away from the formentioned       
 properties.The outer route would still
 affect five holes on the golf course  
 but clever landscaping on the D.O.T.  
 route would avoid adverse effects in  
 the area.                             </content>
