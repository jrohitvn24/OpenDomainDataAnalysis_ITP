		<title>03Where People Work</title>
		<content> When the houses were first built in   
 this area most people worked in or    
 around{Coalville.}Many of the men     
 worked in{Snibston}or{Whitwick        
{Collieries;}others worked in factories
 in the centre of Coalville,on the     
 railway or in one of the local        
 quarries.                             
 Many people in the area now work      
 further afield,mainly in{Leicester}or 
{Loughborough}and since the completion 
 of the{M1 motorway,}with an access    
 point only four miles away,{Nottingham
 and{Derby}have become easy to         
 reach.Facilities in these towns are   
 now also used by local people for     
 leisure and shopping.
