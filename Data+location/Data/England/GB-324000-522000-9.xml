 The Pencil Mill started in 1832.The   
 firm that ran it then was the Greta   
 Pencil Works and Black Lead Mill of   
 Banks and Co in forge Mill.They sell  
 more pencils now than they did in     
 1832.About 1,500,000 pencils are made 
 a week and 6,000,ooo a month.         
 At the Pencil Mill there are 115      
 people working.They make 650 different
 kinds of pencils.The first thing you  
 need to make a pencil is a piece of   
 wood.Californian Cedar is the wood    
 that is mainly used for pencils.The   
 wood is then grooved which means      
 curved dents are made in the wood.Next
 the leads are placed in the middle.   
 After that another piece of grooved   
 wood is placed on top and glued       
 together.The wood is then shaped into 
 round pencils.Then the pencils are    
 painted,glossed and stamped.          </content>
