		<content> Gardening ranks high as a leisure     
 activity, many people growing fruit   
 and vegatables as well as raising     
 flowers and grass.  Car maintenance,  
 even if no more than the occasional   
 wash, is a general chore.  Many people
 belong to one of the several village  
 organisations (see Clubs page 16) or  
 take part in the Whist, Indoor Bowls  
 and Bingo evenings at the Village     
 Hall.  A number of people play bridge.
 Swimming (at Gainsborough or Scun-    
 thorpe), keep fit and jogging are     
 popular, some play badminton (at      
 Scotter) or squash (Gainsborough) and 
 Scotton's tennis court is much used.  
 The "Three Horseshoes" pub at Scotton 
 is part of the leisure scene.  Young  
 people at Northorpe have a play area  
 with swings; youth clubs come and go  
 in Scotton, a Youth Fellowship starts 
 this autumn.Scouts/Guides at Scotter. </content>
