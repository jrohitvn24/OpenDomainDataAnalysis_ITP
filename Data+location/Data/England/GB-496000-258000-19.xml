		<title>19Sharnbrook's Farms</title>
		<content> The{'three field' system}of farming   
 used in the Middle Ages remained in   
 Sharnbrook till the{Enclosures}of     
 1820.  The hedges have gone again to  
 open up the small fields so the       
 farmers can use their huge machines.  
 Low lying meadows near the river and  
 brook are used for{fattening beef     
{cattle,}while the rough grazing around
 the village is used for{sheep}or      
 horses - the latter kept for          
 recreational purposes.                
 On the heavier, higher land{grain     
{crops}are grown;{oil seed rape}is a   
 recently introduced break crop.       
 One farmer keeps{pigs}on an intensive 
 system, as well as rearing{turkeys}for
 the traditional Christmas dinner.     
 The farms are highly mechanised and   
 very few people are employed on the   
 land.  There is one{market garden     
 producing salad crops.                </content>
