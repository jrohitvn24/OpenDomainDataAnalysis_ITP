		<content> Our survey shows that the village is  
 small and struggling to retain its    
 own separate institutions.Although    
 people come and go it still manages to
 preserve its own identity with its own
 Church and School but because of its  
 size constant vigilance is necessary  
 to ensure that these two, as well as  
 the Post Office,Bus Service (however  
 infreqent),and Telephone Kiosks are   
 kept here in the face of the current  
 twin Gods of efficiency and economy.
