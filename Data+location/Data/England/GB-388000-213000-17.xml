		<content>"I attended a 900 pupil,11-18 age-range
mixed comprehensive school.I am 16     
years old and leave on March 29th.I am 
doing 2 exams in English and hope to   
get good grades.{When I leave} I have a
part-time job to go to in a cafe.Then I
may go on a {YTS} scheme but I hope to 
join the army".                        
An 11 year old says that there is a big
difference between {junior and senior  
schools} in that the comprehensive     
pupils have different teachers for     
different subjects.He says"In the      
juniors you have one teacher and have  
to learn all the subjects but in the   
seniors you can specialise".           
A teacher says of his mid-June bike    
ride home from school while going up   
Coopers Hill that he passed a trailer  
in a lay-by selling garden gnomes-     
"Ideal Gnome Exhibition" said the sign.
