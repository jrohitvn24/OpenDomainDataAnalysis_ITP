		<title>14COMMUNITY EDUCATION TUTOR</title>
		<content> The Community Education Tutor helps   
 adults who are returning to study     
 subjects after leaving school many    
 years ago. She arranges for them to   
 join school lessons or adult education
 classes. She organises a short course 
 to help them to get ready for lessons.
 Recently, she has also started a new  
 course for mothers who want to return 
 to work after having their family.    
 Cranford Community School has over two
 thousand pupils. 1,200 are young      
 people and the rest are adults. Most  
 of the 'pupils' live in Cranford,     
 Hounslow or Southall.                 
 Many pupils like the school because it
 is bigger and has more facilities than
 other schools. Lots of pupils have    
 brothers and sisters in the school and
 some of their parents come to play    
 sport and continue their education.
