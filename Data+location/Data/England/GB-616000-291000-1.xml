		<title>01FARMING AREAS</title>
		<content> This area remains very much the same  
 as in the original domesday survey,   
 i.e.mainly farmland. The main         
 difference lies in the advances made  
 in farming techniques over the last   
 900 years. The small mixed farms have 
 disappeared and with them the small   
 communities and smaller dwelling      
 places and cottages.                  
 There are now 22 working farms who    
 between them own three quarters of the
 area. Most of the land is in          
 agricultural use for the production of
 wheat, barley and rape seed.          
 Many of the fields are being opened   
 up, but there are still some hedges   
 left, mainly along the roadside       
 boudaries. The tree cover is sparce   
 and there are no woods or thickets.   
 Most of the older trees  are boundary 
 markers and the new trees have been   
 planted to compliment the countryside.</content>
