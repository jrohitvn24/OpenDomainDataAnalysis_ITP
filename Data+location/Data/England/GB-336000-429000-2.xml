     The village green with its duck   
pond is the main attraction of the     
village.   The green covers about 3    
acres and is one of the largest in the 
country.   The adult football team uses
it on Sunday mornings and the cricket  
team on Saturday afternoons.   The     
village school children use it to play 
games.                                 
                                       
     The main annual event on the Green
is WREA GREEN FIELD DAY.   On the last 
Saturday in June a Fancy Dress parade  
is held and during it the "Queen" is   
crowned after which sports and a       
children's tea take place.             
                                       
     There is a small industrial       
estate providing work on the site of   
the disused railway station.
