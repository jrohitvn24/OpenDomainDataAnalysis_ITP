   Gheluvelt Park used to be called    
 Barbourne Park but it changed in      
 1918 at the end of the first world    
 war to Gheluvelt, a place in          
 Belgium.Why Belgium?  The Worcester   
 regiment fought and many died. It is  
 in  Worcester on a main road .It has  
 got{swings, slides, roundabouts}and   
 lots more. There's a{paddling pool}to 
 paddle in and lots of green grass to  
 play on.You can have a game  of       
{putting}or play tennis It has big     
 gardens with lots of seats.It has a   
 large{pond}with ducks and a brook. The
 pond has a{band stand}for music but it
 is not used very often now . You are  
 not allowed to ride your bike because 
 there is a new park keeper.A nice     
 place to go to on summer afternoons.
