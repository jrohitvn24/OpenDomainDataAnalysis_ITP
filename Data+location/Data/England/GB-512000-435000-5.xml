		<title>05Tourism Consiton/Swine</title>
		<content> Because the min A165 Hull- Bridlington
 road by-passes Coniston few tourists  
 are attracted to its rural charm.     
 However those who do make the detour  
 will find a visit to its neighbour,   
 Swine worthhile. Swine is about one   
 mile west of Coniston along a minor   
 backroad. The main attraction here is 
 the church with its 12th century nave 
 which was originally the chancel of a 
 Cistercian church established in 1150.
 The beautiful 16th centry screen, with
 its Davey, Hilton, Melton and         
 Lascelles family badges, separates the
 north aisle from the Hilton knights in
 14th century armour, two of whom lie  
 alongside their ladies. Other groups  
 provide swine with the finest set of  
 village church effigies in the East   
 Riding. The quaintly humerous         
 misericords underneath the choir-stall
 are well worth inspecting.            </content>
