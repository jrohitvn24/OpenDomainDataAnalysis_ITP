		<content> In the early part of this century most
 people worked in the quarries,some at 
 the shirt works on Meadow Lane. There 
 were about l0 quarries.The smaller    
 ones amalgamated to form Buxton Lime  
 later taken over by Staveley &amp; ICI.The
 Peak Forest Tramway was working       
 between the quarries &amp; Buxworth.      
 Today people travel out of Dove Holes 
 to work-places which include Chapel,  
 Buxton,Castleton,Chinley,Whaley       
 Bridge,Manchester,Stockport,Bristol &amp; 
 Stuttgart.                            
 Occupations include hairdressing,rail-
 way,banking,quarrying,building,teach- 
 ing,shopwork,nursing,police,lorry-driv
 ing,mining,&amp;factory work.             
 People make good use of the regular   
 bus &amp; train service between Buxton &amp;  
 Manchester and many have their own    
 transport.
