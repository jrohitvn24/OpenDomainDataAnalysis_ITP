		<content>{ATTITUDES}TOWARDS THE NEW ROAD VARY.  
 MOST PEOPLE FEEL IT IS A LONG TIME    
 OVERDUE.{ACCIDENTS}INVOLVING          
 PEDESTRIANS, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN    
 HAVE CAUSED A GREAT DEMAND FOR THE {  
{BY-PASS}TO BE BUILT. SOME PEOPLE FEEL 
 THAT THE ROAD DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH   
 AND SHOULD NOT JOIN CREWE ROAD UNTIL  
 WELL OUTSIDE THE TOWN CENTRE.         
 PEOPLE WHO LIVE CLOSE TO THE SITE HAD 
 SOME RESERVATIONS. THE ROAD PASSES    
 CLOSE TO THE CONGLETON ROAD ESTATE    
 GIVING THE{RESIDENTS}GREAT FEAR FOR   
 THEIR CHILDREN. RESIDENTS IN THE      
 PALMER ROAD ESTATE ARE IRRITATED BY   
 THE GENERAL INCONVENIENCE OF THE      
 BUILDING. HAVING ONLY RECENTLY BEEN   
 GIVEN A GOOD ROAD SURFACE THEY ARE PUT
 OUT BY THIS NEW DISRUPTION.HOWEVER,   
 LOCAL GARAGE OWNER ON NEWCASTLE ROAD  
 SHOULD BE PLEASED BY THE PROSPECT OF  
 NEW CUSTOM.                           </content>
