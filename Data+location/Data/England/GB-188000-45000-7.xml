 Looking after the health of families  
 at home is a team effort with 8 people
 attached to the practice serving 6 &amp; a
 half thousand patients.One full_time &amp;
 one part_time midwife are responsible 
 for the ante_natal &amp; immediate post_  
 natal care.Most mothers now go to     
 hospital for the birth.The health     
 visitors,one full_time &amp; one part_time
 care for children from 10 days old    
 until school age &amp; also help the      
 elderly,of whom there is a large but  
 not increasing number.The district    
 nurses look after the medical &amp;       
 surgical cases.The biggest improvement
 in their work has come with disposable
 syringes,dressings etc.Previously     
 dressings had to be sterilised in the 
 oven,sometimes with unfortunate       
 results!
