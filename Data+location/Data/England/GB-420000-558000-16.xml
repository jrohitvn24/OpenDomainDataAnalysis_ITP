		<content> we asked local people how often they  
 shopped for groceries. 32.5% shop     
 daily, 62.3% weekly, 2.8% fortnightly 
 and 2.2% monthly.                     
 Choice of shopping place varied       
 according to where they lived. 76% of 
 Whickham shoppers and 55% of Sunniside
 ones use the four supermarkets in     
 Whickham, 76% of Lobley Hill shoppers 
 use supermarkets in Gateshead town    
 centre while only l5.3% used Whickham 
 - despite being nearer. A small       
 number(l0%) of Whickham and Sunniside 
 shoppers use hypermarkets at          
 Washington or Stanley. Newcastle city 
 centre is not seen as somewhere to buy
 food, but when asked about goods not  
 bought locally, was the choice when   
 buying clothes, shoes, furniture and  
 household goods. Local shops however  
 were valued, with newsagents and      
 general stores being prized most.     </content>
