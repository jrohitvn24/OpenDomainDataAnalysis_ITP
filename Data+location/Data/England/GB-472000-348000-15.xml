		<title>15EMPLOYMENT IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Apart from agriculture, there are     
 other opportunuties for employment in 
 the rural areas, particularly for the 
 self-employed.  There are several     
 self-employed tradesmen - four        
 builders, a painter/decorator, a      
 carpenter, a horticulturist, two car  
 repairers and two establishments used 
 as boarding kennels. Some of these    
 businesses employ a few staff, others 
 are one-man concerns. There is a large
 business outside {Elston}engaged in   
 the manufacture of motor caravans.{   
{Elston Towers}(also known as{         
{Middleton's Folly}), an imposing      
 building close to the{Fosse Way}, has 
 seen several business ventures.  It   
 was used as a maggot factory at one   
 time but closed down in 1974 much to  
 the relief of the local population!   
 There has been recent interest in     
 converting it into a motel.           </content>
