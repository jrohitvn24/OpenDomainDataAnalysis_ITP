		<title>20THE VILLAGE, BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   Beaford has several examples of old 
 cottages and buildings.  Thatched     
 cottages with cob walls can be seen at
 the Beehive and cottages further down 
 Bond Street.  These latter buildings  
 once housed families working for local
 farmers, and often had large families 
 occupying their small rooms.  Several 
 premises must date back to the 1600's;
 nearby farms much earlier that this.  
 The farms however, have been much     
 altered, and only small parts of      
 original buildings remain.  Upcott and
 Woolleigh are very old, being         
 mentioned in the first Domesday, as   
 was Beaford itself.                   
   The village now has a wide mixture  
 of buildings, from the picturesque    
 thatched cottage of previous centuries
  to stone buildings of the last       
 century, to the modern block and brick
 built house and bungalow.             </content>
