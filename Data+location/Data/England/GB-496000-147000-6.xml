		<title>06SOME BUILDINGS IN GUILDFORD</title>
		<content>  Three notable buildings in Guildford 
 High Street are the Civic Hall, the   
 Guildford Museum and Guildford House. 
 The Civic Hall is a venue for many    
 rock groups and choirs. An annual     
 school festival of singing is held    
 there as well as many meetings of     
 schools and other organisations.      
  The Guildford Museum is hardly       
 noticeable from its exterior, as it is
 just a building near the River Wey,   
 but inside it has a wealth of         
 historical remnants, ranging from     
 Stone Age weapons and burial ornaments
 through musical instruments to iron   
 work and embroidery.                  
  Guildford House houses many          
 exhibitions of paintings, sculpture   
 and embroidery. It is a mainly wooden 
 structure and has a beautiful wooden  
 staircase inside. Its many rooms have 
 polished wooden floors.   Anna Knights</content>
