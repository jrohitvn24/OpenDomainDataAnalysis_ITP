		<title>12Henham dragon</title>
		<content> In the 17th century a man riding a    
 horse in Henham saw a "dragon".On     
 arriving home he described the dragon 
 as a 2-3metre long beast with sheep   
 like eyes,very sharp teeth and small  
 wings.Women,children and some men were
 scared to go out of the village       
 because of the dragon although no     
 damage was done nor was anyone hurt by
 it.Villagers had spread wild rumours  
 about the dragon although some people 
 thought it was only a diver bird blown
 off course.Not many people actually   
 saw the dragon and those who did had  
 usually just left one of the local    
 public houses! These witnesses may not
 have been seeing too clearly! The     
 dragon remains Henham's most famous   
 legend and where it was first seen can
 still be visited at Birch Wood near   
 Lodge Farm.
