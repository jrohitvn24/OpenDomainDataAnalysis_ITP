		<title>11GHOSTS OF MATHON</title>
		<content>   It is said that there are two ghosts
 in Mathon.One is on the back road to  
 Mathon Court.Dogs bark at invisible   
 things and go mad.The other is said to
 be an old school mistress sitting on a
 bench outside the old school.They are 
 both ladies.I think that the one at   
 Mathon Court was caused by a squabble 
 about who should own Mathon Court and 
 her evil nephew murdered her and      
 claimed Mathon Court for himself.Then 
 it was rebuilt when the nephew died.  
   The other was caused by suicide.the 
 stairs had fallen in after a German   
 bomb had dropped and caused a fire.The
 fire was on the upper floor only.She  
 had lowered a wooden ladder through   
 the window and the boys had           
 escaped.But,to stop the fire from     
 spreading,she hoisted the ladder back 
 up and she was burnt.But,you might    
 think differently.                    </content>
