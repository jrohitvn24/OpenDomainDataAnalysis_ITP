		<title>08BUILDINGS IN THE BIBURY AREA</title>
		<content> Most buildings date from the 17th     
 century, being built of cotswold stone
 walls, mullion windows and high       
 pitched roofs of cotswold stone tiles.
 They were originally built as part of 
 a large agricultural estate. Many of  
 the old barns and buildings have been 
 converted to residential use. There   
 are now fewer tenants, many houses    
 being privately owned. Some are only  
 used as weekend and holiday homes.    
 There are two large houses of note in 
 the area, Barnsley Park, which is     
 still a privately owned house, was    
 built in 1720_31, and stands in its   
 own landscaped parkland. Bibury Court 
 is an impressive house dating from    
 Tudor times. It was greatly extended  
 around 1630 to form a large manor     
 house. Since 1968 it has been a hotel 
 used by visitors from all over the    
 world and by local people.            </content>
