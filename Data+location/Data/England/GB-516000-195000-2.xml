		<title>02EMI FILM STUDIOS</title>
		<content> EMI stands for Electrical Mechanical  
 Industries and is owned by the Henson 
 Organisation. This{film studio}was    
 rebuilt in 1936 after a fire, and is  
 now one of the few studios in the     
 world with a ground stage. Three of   
 the nine stages are used for          
{television}recordings. Stage 6 is the 
 largest, being 210 feet long, whilst  
 Stage 7, at 63 square feet, is the    
 smallest. In order to make the film   
 more realistic, large backcloths are  
 hung on an overhead rail surrounding  
 the stage.It usually takes two men two
 days to paint the huge cloth.         
    EMI has it's own{special effects   
 department on the site which covers 38
 acres in total. As well as the 160    
 permanent staff there can be up to 600
 temporary workers when a film is being
 shot. Films recorded here include     
 Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.</content>
