		<title>16THE SLAG BANK,WORKINGTON</title>
		<content> The{slag bank is industrial waste}that
 has been tipped along the coast       
 between Workington and Harrington,2.5 
 miles to the south. Part of it is     
 within the{MOBET enterprise zone.}The 
 development of the slag bank has      
 pushed the{coastline seawards.        
   The slag bank is made from waste    
 called{silica}a by-product of the     
 making of iron in the{blast furnaces. 
 The last blast furnace closed down in 
 1981. The waste was piled up on top of
{Chappel Hill}developing it to a height
 of{220 feet above sea level,}this is  
 nearly 100 feet above the original    
 height of Chappel Hill.               
   Part of the MOBET scheme is to      
{reduce the slag bank}to it's original 
 height and re-expose Chappel Hill.    
 When this has been done they intend to
{grass the area and plant trees}to make
 Workington's coastline more attractive</content>
