		<title>19THE "HAREFIELD"</title>
		<content> Four open hatch bulk carriers were    
 commissioned in the early 1980's to be
 built by Hyundai Heavy Industries of  
 South Korea.The ships were to be named
 after English villages ending in      
 "field".The four villages chosen were 
 Chelsfield, Harefield, Petersfield and
 Westfield.                            
 The "Harefield" was launched late in  
 1984 and in March 1985 made her maiden
 voyage to Avonmouth.The Buries Markes 
 Ship Management Co. presented         
 Harefield History Society with a      
 commemorative medal and a copy of the 
 entry in Lloyds List.                 
 It is intended by the society to frame
 the medal together with a picture of  
 the vessel and display it in either   
 the library or St. Mary's Church.
