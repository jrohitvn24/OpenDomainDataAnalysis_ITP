		<content>   Buckingham  is{famous }for its{lace.
 Lace-making  started  along  time  ago
 when  it  was found that  land  was no
 suitable for sheep and the wool trade.
                                       
   Buckingham lace is{point d'Angelerre
 It was a  cottage  industry and became
{hereditary.}Generations  of Buckingham
 people learn to make lace.            
                                       
   I began lace making in February 1983
 ,when a lady called{Stella Mills}asked
 me if I  would  like to  try  spinning
 fleece  into  wool. When I  had  a try
 Stella asked me if I would like to try
 lace. So I  did  and  decided to start
 this hobby.                           
                                       
   The first piece of lace I made was a
 piece that everyone does. By this time
 I had purchased a{lace pillow, bobbins
 and{pins.                             </content>
