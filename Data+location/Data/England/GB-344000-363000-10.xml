		<title>10Waverton Church Customs</title>
		<content> There has been a church in Waverton   
 for about 900 years.One of the most   
 popular church customs is the{Rogation
{Walk}when we ask for God's blessing on
 the fields. We start at the churchyard
 by singing a hymn and saying prayers. 
 We walk around the village,stopping at
 focal points to sing.To reach points  
 in the parish which are far apart we  
 travel in a hired bus.The children's  
 favourite stop is at Lord Woolley's   
 farm where we have drinks,sandwiches  
 cakes, and ice lollies. The children  
 play on the hay bales. Another popular
 custom is{Plough Sunday}when a calf   
 and plough are brought into church for
 the Rector to bless.On{Remembrance    
{Sunday}all the village organisations  
 come to church including members of   
 the Evangelical church and the        
 Methodists.At the end of the service  
 we gather around the War Memorial.    </content>
