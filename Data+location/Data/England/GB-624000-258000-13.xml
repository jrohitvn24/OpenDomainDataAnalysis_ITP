		<content> There is very little entertainment    
provided here.                         
 If one wants the more sophisticated   
pastimes such as swimmimg,disco,dancing
or cinema,one has to travel to Ipswich-
20 kms away,or Woodbridge 12kms,with a 
very limited public transport service. 
 Many people congregate in local public
houses or hotels,particularly young    
people who find them excellent meeting 
places.                                
 Entertainments such as discos,barn    
dances and coffee mornings are held    
from time to time in village halls.A   
flower show is held annually at Kettl- 
eburgh.Church fetes &amp; garden parties   
raise funds for the churches or their  
chosen charities.                      
 Womens' Institute meetings are held   
monthly at Brandeston or Kettleburgh.  
 Cycling is popular for transport &amp;    
fun.                                   </content>
