		<title>06Birds in our area</title>
		<content>A group of children carried out a bird 
survey in the locale of Aston Rowant,  
Kingston Blount and Chinnor.They lie   
between the Upper and Lower Icknield   
Ways,along the spring line at the floor
of the Chiltern Hills.The land is      
agricutural,mainly arable,with some    
grazing.The gardens around the villages
the thick hedges along the tracks and  
the adjacent,disused railway line,     
provide a rich area both for breeding  
species and for winter migrants which  
feed on the lush selection of berries. 
Birds breeding in the mature,beech     
woodlands on the Chiltern escarpment,  
such as green and greater spotted      
woodpeckers,visit the area mainly in   
the winter,although the lesser spotted 
woodpecker is a rare visitor since     
Dutch Elm disease decimated the elms.  
The number of sparrowhawks has         
increased since DDT was banned.        </content>
