		<content> There is a derelict cottage in the    
 wood at Dingwood Park which used to be
 the gamekeeper's. We also discovered  
 some lime kilns which were used to    
 produce fertiliser. The presence of   
 lime in the Dingwood Park area has    
 made the water very hard. The water   
 originally obtained by windpump is now
 pumped by electricity.                
 Many changes have taken place in the  
 area as a whole. The population has   
 decreased dramatically and as the     
 younger people have moved away there  
 has been an influx of retired business
 and professional people. Many of the  
 cottages once used by farm or estate  
 workers are now week-end or holiday   
 homes.
