		<content> own some part of their land.          
 Two local beauty spots in the Stainby 
 area which were originally a quarry   
 and railway cutting respectively,     
 which supported abundant wild life    
 flora and fauna have been taken over  
 as rubbish tips and are being infilled
 - thus destroying this heritage.      
 There are no amenities in Stainby -   
 the only pub closed many years ago,   
 and the school within the last decade,
 both are now private residences.      
 The Church is still a focal point.    
 St. Peter's was built in 1900, and is 
 a fine stone church boasting a        
 magnificent organ - now in need of    
 urgent repair - and a lovely chiming  
 clock which has recently been repaired
 at a cost of Â£375.  Communion Service 
 is sadly held only once a month, and  
 the parishioners through very loyal   
 seldom reach over the dozen mark.     </content>
