<title>11Remembering the Toxteth Riots</title>
<content>I remember some of my classmates coming into school (Toxteth CP School), crying about the riots with the whole class listening in. That was the first time I heard about the riots, ahd it was petrifying for an eight year old. Going home from school I passed policemen in groups of five, with a german shepherd dog with each group. They looked menancing. We lived on the corner of Windsor Street and Admiral Street, right next to Admiral Street Police Station. I remembered my Dad boarding up the windows and packing our things so we could leave the next day. That night, the noise of the rioters and the screams of the policemen filled the air, with the odd glow from petrol fires lighting the night sky, glimpsed briefly through the cracks of my boarded bedroom window. That night felt very long indeed.&lt;br />
