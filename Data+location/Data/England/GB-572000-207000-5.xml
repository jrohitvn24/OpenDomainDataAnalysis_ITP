		<title>05New Houses in Chelmsford</title>
		<content> We went to the eastern side of the    
 busy{A12}to see the brand new homes   
 built by Wimpeys. We discovered that  
 they were not on any existing map.    
 We interviewed the building foreman   
 and he said, " We employ about thirty 
 people who get paid, on average, about
 Â£100 a week.Some builders can earn    
 double this with overtime.We expect to
 finish this site in 1987 but some     
 families have moved in already."      
 We spoke to one family,the Tays. They 
 told us they had been there for seven 
 months, having paid Â£39000 for a two- 
 bedroomed house with a garage.In spite
 of the busy and noisy A12 and the     
 nearby industrial estate, they were   
 pleased with their house and its      
 position.We surveyed the A12 and      
 counted over three hundred southbound 
 vehicles in less than twelve minutes, 
 during the early afternoon.           </content>
