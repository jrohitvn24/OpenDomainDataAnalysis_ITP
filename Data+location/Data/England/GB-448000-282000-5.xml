		<title>05MORE OF THE CHURCH AT WILLEY</title>
		<content> In the Victorian times the vicar Rev. 
 Morgan Palor helped build a new vestry
 &amp; chancel,a stained glass East window 
 is dedicated to his memory.A new font,
 pulpit &amp; lecturn were installed it is 
 recorded that several Bishops attended
 the reconsecration of this small      
 church.Church life has changed,now the
 vicar is shared with Churchover parish
 with one family communion service a   
 fortnight in Willey,attended by a     
 congregation of about fourteen.       
 The Mayor of Rugby comes to the       
 Harvest Festival service, a special   
 occasion. A CUSTOM continued at       
 Baptisms today is leaving a small door
 open in the South wall of the Chancel 
 to allow the devil to escape. Grooves 
 on the outer walls, were probably made
 by scythes being sharpened a CUSTOM   
 said to bring a good harvest.
