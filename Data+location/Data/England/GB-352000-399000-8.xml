		<title>08MONTREY RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday 26th June a man called 
 Mr. Martin _Jones came to school to   
 tell us about Montrey Reservoir.It is 
 situated to the North _ West of Arch  
 Lane Farm.He told us that the         
 Victorians built it and that now they 
 are putting a roof on it to stop      
 pollution, they are also putting a    
 new floor over the top of the old one 
 which was made ot of clay and bricks. 
   The people in Liverpool get their   
 water from Wales the River Dee and    
 Rivington. The Reservoir is fifteen   
 feet deep,the water in it comes from  
 Rivington.The roof is to be made of   
 Aluminium because it has to be light. 
 The floor is to be concrete blocks.   
  Mr.Martin_Jones doesn,t actually     
 work at the Reservoir because it is   
 all computerised,  he works at the    
 North West Water Authority.He draws   
 the plans of Reservoirs.              </content>
