		<content>    This is an ideal area for ramblers 
 as it is crossed by many footpaths,   
 giving excellant views of the downs   
 and surrounding countryside.Many of   
 the footpaths follow the route of the 
 old carriage roads and Pilgrim's way  
 between Newbury and Winchester.       
    The nine members of Kingsclere     
 Women's Institute who conducted this  
 survey enjoyed walking many of these  
 paths and meeting local residents.They
 were met with interest and received   
 the utmost co-operation from everyone.
