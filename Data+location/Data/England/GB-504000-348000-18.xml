		<title>18CHANGES:LEASINGHAM (PART1)</title>
		<content>  In{1951,}all traffic north to Lincoln
 had to pass through Leasingham along  
 Lincoln Road:one villager remembers a 
 tail-back of traffic for hundreds of  
 yards through the village,when a      
 sudden freeze turned the road into a  
 skating rink.Since the construction of
 the{A15 bypass road in the 1950's,    
 traffic through the village is light  
 and the village is a very quiet but   
 thriving place.                       
   The{1951 census}showed only{465     
{people}living in Leasingham,in small  
 groups of dwellings mainly around the 
 four sides of the village.The rest was
 grassland or farmland.                
   In the present school grounds stood 
 a stone-built{schoolhouse.}There were 
 about{30 pupils,}who took mats to keep
 their feet warm on the stone          
 floor.Opposite were the buildings and 
 outhouses of{The Hall Farm.           </content>
