		<title>03POPULATION OF BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> Balquhidder has always been a farming 
 area. Farms have been passed down from
 generation to generation. Up till     
 recently farms have supported families
 of farm hands and shepherds. However, 
 within the last 30 years, when        
 shepherds moved away, they have not   
 been replaced and their houses have   
 either been used as holiday homes or  
 sold very often as retirement homes.  
 The result is that firstly, the       
 population of the glen has fallen and 
 secondly, incomers are now in the     
 majority. Strangely enough many of the
 new residents have come from abroad.  
 Balquhidder is now quite an           
 international community with families 
 from Iceland, Holland, Germany, Spain 
 and England. The birth rate has fallen
 and as children grow up they leave the
 glen for employment elsewhere.
