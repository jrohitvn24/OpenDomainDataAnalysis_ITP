		<content>The northern part of our area straddles
the southern boundary of the city of   
Birmingham and is suburban.The southern
and much greater part is in Wythall and
is rural.Kings Norton village,its old  
church and Victorian school is a       
conservation area.Since the 2nd.world  
war B'ham has built several municipal  
{housing} estates along the line of the
main Redditch Road and BÂ£ham to        
Worcester Canal in the west.Bells Lane 
is the main east-west route also with  
municipal housing along it.The largest 
{shopping} centre is in the east at The
Maypole,along the main road to         
Alcester.Parallel to this the Hollywood
By-pass cuts south through the         
{farmlands} of Wythall.This rural area 
has remained unchanged for centuries.It
is predominantly improved grassland for
cattle and sheep.Written by children at
Sir Theodore Pritchett Primary School. </content>
