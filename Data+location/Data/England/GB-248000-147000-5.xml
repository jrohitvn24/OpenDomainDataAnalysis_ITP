		<content> For 20 minutes in one place 170       
 different vehicles passed me.There    
 were:133 cars,14 vans,9 comercial     
 vans,6 push bikes,3 lorries and 3     
 motor bikes,1 bus.This proves that    
 cars are definately a very popular    
 form of transport.Vans are used quite 
 a lot for advertising.Push bikes      
 weren't very common,I only saw 6.Motor
 bikes and lorries were very scarce but
 there were a few.Also,I saw an R.A.F  
 bus.Coaches must be busy because I    
 usually see a lot.My position was next
 to "foto powel" on the High Street    
 from 4:20 to 4:40 p.m.There are 3 main
 roads going into Ilfracombe but they  
 are not very wide and makes the       
 journey quite slow.People used to     
 travel to Ilfracombe by sea,but now   
 this only happens in the summer.
