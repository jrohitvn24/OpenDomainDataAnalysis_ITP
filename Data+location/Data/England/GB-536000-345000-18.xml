		<content> In our area there are three pubs{The  
{Castle,The Five Bells and The Admiral 
{Nelson.}They are all {Batemans pubs.  
{Batemans beer }is brewed in{Wainfleet.
{Wainfleet}is near Skegness and 15     
 miles from{Boston.Batemans bitter     
{costs 64p a pint,half a lager costs   
{40p and mild costs 58p a pint.        
{The Castle }has a beer garden for     
 playing in and has seats outside for  
 sitting on.It also has a boat to play 
 and climb on.It is run by{Mr.G.Cripsey
{and his son Asa goes to our school.   
{The Castle}has more trade in the      
 summer because of all the traffic     
 going to Skegness,which is a sea-side 
 resort.                               
 The pubs have food now to sell at     
 lunch times and tea time.
