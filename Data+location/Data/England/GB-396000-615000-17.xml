		<content> There are several types of sheep. The 
 most popular breeds are the Cheviot   
 and Border Leicester sheep. The sheep 
 (ewes) have had their lambs by        
 April. The sheep normally just roam   
 around the hills all day, but always  
 return to their own area. The Cheviot 
 is valuable because it is a good      
 dual-purpose sheep, producing best    
 quality mutton and wool.              
     The sheep take their name from the
 Cheviot Hills between England and     
 Scotland. They are distinguished by a 
 hairless white face and straight ears.
     The Border Leicester is a very big
 sheep distinguished by high carriage  
 of the head and a distinct Roman Nose.
