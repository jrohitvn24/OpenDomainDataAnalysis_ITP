		<title>08THE OLD VICARAGE</title>
		<content> The old vicarage is a very big house. 
 The kitchen has some numbers on the   
 wall which go up to 8 and there used  
 to be some bells. The people who owned
 the vicarage had a bell in each room. 
 There were 8 rooms. The rest belonged 
 to the servants. At the moment there  
 are 7 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1 lounge,
 1 drawing room, 1 dining room, 1      
 kitchen, 5 stairs and 3 landings. They
 have also about 7 acres of land and in
 it is a wood. There used to be a      
 fireplace in every room but some are  
 blocked up. Most of the floors were   
 stone or wooden planks and some were  
 carpet. Quite a lot of the rooms had  
 wooden shutters which locked like some
 wardrobe doors. Nearly all the door   
 knobs were brass with circles getting 
 bigger and bigger from the middle. The
 key to the main door was very, very   
 big.                                  </content>
