		<title>02THE  RIVER  WORFE</title>
		<content> The river flows across the area from  
 N-SW and starts as three brooks,the   
 Ruckley Brook,Neachley Brook and the  
 Albrighton Brook which join in the    
 middle of the area to form the River  
 Worfe.The Worfe then flows SW until it
 joins the River Severn at Bridgnorth. 
   The Worfe flows across soft New Red 
 Sandstone which acts as an aquafier as
 well as allowing the brooks and river 
 to cut quite deep steep sided valleys.
 Onthe Hatton Grange estate it forms a 
 steep narrow rocky gorge which has had
 a number of dams built across it to   
 provide a succession of ornamental    
 pools.At the junction of the three    
 brooks carts and carriages had to ford
 the river.                            
  Above the confluence a 5 acre pool   
 was emptied by the R.A.F in 1940 and  
 in 1962 when the dam burst.Pools at   
 Neachley and Ruckley have dried up.   </content>
