		<content> GROVE LAKE                            
 Grove Lake is more usually called The 
 Duckpond by the locals.The site was   
 purchased and developed as a public   
 amenity about 1971.                   
 Tiptree has a big duck pond.It stands 
 at the beginning of the main street.It
 has moorhens, mallards and other water
 birds.The main road runs beside the   
 duck pond.The pond has railings round 
 it.In the middle there is an island   
 with trees and flowers.The ducks sleep
 on this island.The village people look
 after the ducks by feeding them bread 
 but the owners feed the ducks         
 properly.The pond is man made.
