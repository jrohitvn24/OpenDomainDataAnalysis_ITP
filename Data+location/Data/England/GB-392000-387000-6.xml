		<title>06Marple Carnival.</title>
		<content>     Every year in mid-June{Marple     
{Carnival}is held.It is a great        
 occasion when all the family can have 
 a good day out.We had a word with Mr. 
 Burton,one of the organisers,he       
 explained that all the money raised is
 given to the{local charities.         
     Each year the total amount raised 
 depends on the weather. If it is fine 
 then more money is collected.He also  
 said "The total amounts raised are    
 very different each year. For         
 instance, one year they raised Â£800   
 and the next Â£3000." He told us that  
 the carnival had been going for 23    
 years,{since 1962.}We asked him if he 
 knew anything about the fair,held     
 after the carnival,in Brabyns Park. He
 told us that it comes to Marple each  
 year as long as there is a carnival.
