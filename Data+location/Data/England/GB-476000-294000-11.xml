		<title>11HALLATON CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content>  The Rector of Hallaton has five other
 parishes under his control: Allexton, 
 Horninghold, East Norton, Tugby and   
 Slawston. Regular Sunday services are 
 still held at each church. In Hallaton
 there is a Communion service every    
 Sunday, a midweek service and Evensong
 twice a month. The congregation varies
 between 10 and 40, more villagers     
 attend at Christmas, Easter and       
 Harvest Festival. On the evening      
 following the Harvest Festival there  
 is a Supper in the Stenning Hall.     
 Events such as this continue to make  
 the church an important focus for     
 village life. Many people help with   
 and attend the church Christmas Bazaar
 and Summer Fete. There is an active   
 non-conformist Chapel with a service  
 every Sunday. Lay preachers from the  
 Leicester area take the service at    
 which about 15 people are present.    </content>
