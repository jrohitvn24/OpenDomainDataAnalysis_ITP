 boats and they came from shore and    
 took the three men.  The child asked  
 Mr. Palmer if she could go back to the
 Windbound with him and David (a 12    
 year old boy.)  They went to shore    
 then went to the Windbound for a      
 drink. Mr. Palmer told us an          
 interesting fact about the Severn     
 Bore, the Severn Bore needs a strong  
 tide to come past the lighthouse.The  
 front of the Bore chases lots of fish 
 down the Severn, so it is a good time 
 to go fishing.  When Mr. Palmer came  
 to his house near the lighthouse, it  
 was all like a wilderness to him.  All
 he saw was a few farm carts and       
 farmers, it was a very lonely place.  
   Mr. Palmer once met Prince Charles  
 when he visited Purton in 1973.
