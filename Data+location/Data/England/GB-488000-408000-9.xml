		<content>  I have five people in my family. Me, 
 Amanda, my two brothers Andrew and    
 Neil, and my mum and dad, Jill and    
 John.                                 
  We live in a semi-detatched house in 
 Scunthorpe. My dad works at Scunthorpe
{Steel Works,}my mum works at          
 Scunthorpe Police Station as a{typist,
 Neil is a{plumber}and Andrew is an    
{engineer.}I have three{pets:}a budgie,
 a cat and a goldfish. I get Â£1.50     
{pocket money}every week; Andrew and   
 Neil don't get pocket money because   
 they are both working full time.      
  We don't go out much together but    
 once a year we all go on{holiday      
 together and enjoy ourselves. My dad  
 does{shift work}so he does all the    
 cooking and some of the cleaning while
 mum's at work. We are a very happy    
 family and we enjoy life.
