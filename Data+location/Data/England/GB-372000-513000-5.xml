		<title>05Roads &amp; Traffic in Warcop</title>
		<content> Only one major road, the A66 between  
 Workington and Middlesborough, passes 
 through our block. It is a busy route 
 which used to be a Roman road. There  
 has been a lot of improvements on the 
 road recently, with by-passes being   
 built around villages like Brough, and
 Appleby.                              
 There is a secondary road, the B6259, 
 which also passes through our block,  
 joining the A66 and Kirkby Stephen.   
 Most of the roads in the area are     
 small, single track roads, mostly used
 by farm vehicles like tractors and    
 cattle wagons.                        
 There is only one bus service, on the 
 A66; the bus that came through Warcop 
 once a week has just been stopped.    
 This means that many people have to   
 buy their own car, or ask for lifts if
 they want to get anywhere.
