		<content> There is no definite village in Bishop
 Thornton, but it contains scattered   
 hamlets and farmhouses. The boundaries
 of the parish are the streams and     
 faults in the land. Bishop Thornton   
 was mentioned in the Domesday Book as 
 "TORENTUME", which means "Farmstead   
 surrounded by thorns." It had the     
 pre-fix "Bishop" because the land was 
 owned by the Archbishop of York and   
 the first record we have is in 1030.  
 "Tun" is the commonest English        
 settlement name. Other hamlets are    
 Dole Bank, which was a Nunnery,       
 Hardgate, Shaw Mills, ( so called     
 because Robert Shaw opened a corn mill
 there in the 16th Century. Over the   
 years it has been used for flax,      
 cotton, hemp, silk and suede          
 finishing). Raventoft's and Gillmoor  
 which belonged to Fountains Abbey and 
 was farmed by the monks.              </content>
