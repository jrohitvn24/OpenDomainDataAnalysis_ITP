		<title>17CLUBS IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> This Block contains the bases for     
 several of Herne Bay's sporting clubs.
 The Town has long had a reputation for
 roller skating and although the old   
 pier pavilion has gone the sport      
 continues. Roller hockey is played in 
 the new pier pavilion and in recent   
 years the speedskaters of Herne Bay   
 Flyers Club can be seen most evenings 
 practising in the William Street car  
 park. The Club has several            
 international skaters and it stages an
 annual international tournament in    
 Herne Bay. In recent years Herne Bay  
 Tennis and Hockey Clubs have combined 
 to build a fine club house in Beacon  
 Road, though most hockey matches are  
 still played in the Park. A rather    
 older clubhouse is that of the Herne  
 Bay Sailing Club at the eastern end of
 the town. In Winter this area is      
 rather bleak but in Summer Club v.busy</content>
