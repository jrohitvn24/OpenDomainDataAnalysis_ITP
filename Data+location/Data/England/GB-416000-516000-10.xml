 Every year men come with lorries and  
 erect a large{marquee}on the village  
 green. At 9a.m. all{competitors}bring 
 their produce to be judged. When it is
 displayed and everyone is out of the  
 tent the{judges}begin their task of   
 choosing the best out of each category
{e.g. vegetables, cooking, flowers,    
{sewing, knitting and photographs.     
 There are three prizes of money. First
 prize is Â£2, second is Â£1.50, and     
 third is Â£1. On the evening there is a
{dance and disco}in the marquee and an 
 entrance fee of 50 pence is charged.  
 After the show is over the men begin  
 to clear away, and everyone looks     
 forward to the show next year.
