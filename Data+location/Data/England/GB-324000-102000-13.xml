		<content>        This is a protected building of
 historical interest.On the roof there 
 are two chimneys,one modern the other 
 16/17 century.The roof is made from   
 old thatch.Just below this,on the     
 right, a new drainpipe has been       
 fitted.On the left ,at the bottom of  
 the thatch there are two windows,these
 are not modern.There is  also one     
 window to the right, these are second 
 floor windows.On the first floor there
 are four windows_three to the left,one
 to the right.Below the thatch there is
 a porch.The porch roof is also        
 thatched.The thatch looks newer than  
 the main thatch.Looking directly at   
 the porch you can see a black wooden  
 door.There is a string on the door    
 which you pull.It's the bell.
