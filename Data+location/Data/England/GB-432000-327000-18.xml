		<title>18THE RIVER TRENT.</title>
		<content> The River Trent flows from west to    
 east along the southern boundary of   
 the defined area.The river has many   
 characteristics of a river in its     
 'middle course'.Examples of river     
 terraces,river cliffs,meanders and    
 abandoned meanders are visible.No     
 major tributaries join the river along
 this section but numerous drains from 
 the floodplain pasture land empty into
 the river.The river itself is not     
 navigable by large commercial vessels 
 along this stretch but is used by     
 small pleasure craft.Angling is       
 another recreational pastime offered  
 by the river.                         
 The river cliff close to Sycamore     
 Farm,Ingleby is mainly used for dairy 
 farming but the cliff top fields are  
 used for various types of arable      
 cultivation.                          
                                       </content>
