		<title>13Kettlesing - A Night Out</title>
		<content>   Entertainment centres around either 
 the village hall or the pubs/restau-  
 rants.                                
   The Felliscliffe Village Hall,      
 located near the Anglican Church,     
 holds many social functions,  from the
 occasional disco, to a Young Farmers' 
 Club, the Women's Institute, and vo-  
 cational courses, e.g., spinning.     
   The two pubs, i.e., the Queen's Head
 in Kettlesing Village itself, and the 
 Black Bull on the A59, are well pa-   
 tronised, the former being a popular  
 eating place. The licensed restaurant,
 The Millstones, is on the A59,        
 attracting both passing traffic plus  
 holding regular social functions,     
 e.g., dinner dances and country-and-  
 western evenings. Young people        
 complain of lack of facilities for    
 their age group, and tend to go to    
 Harrogate for entertainment.          </content>
