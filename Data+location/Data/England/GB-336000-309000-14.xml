		<title>14Pedigree Ayrshires.</title>
		<content>{ Mr.Jones,of Hayford Farm,}keeps pedi-
 gree Ayrshires because they give good 
 quality milk with plenty of protein.  
 When calves are born they have a      
 number tattooed in their right ear.Mr.
 Jones showed us a calf.Its number was 
{L147454.}The L stands for the year,14 
 is for the 14th calf born this year   
 and 7454 is the herd number.He pays{Â£5
 for every calf to be registered in the
{Ayrshire society.}Bull calves go to   
 Shrewsbury market at two weeks old.He 
 keeps one occasionally for breeding.He
 keeps his heifers.When they are two   
 and a half years old they have a calf 
 and start to give milk.They are milked
 for 305 days and then left dry for 2  
 months,then have another calf.Records 
 are kept so that the best milkers are 
 used for breeding.The milk goes to    
{Minsterley Creamery}for yogurt,cottage
 cheese,dried milk and cream.          </content>
