		<content>     There are many people whose work  
 brings then into our home such as the 
 plumber,electrician,window cleaner and
 T.V. repair man.Many people come to   
 the house but not into the home,like  
 the paper boy,milk man and post man.  
     A large part of our area is       
 covered by nurseries and many people  
 are employed in greenhouses. There are
 several places which sell flowers and 
 garden produce. Near Brynfields       
 nursery in Goffs Oak there is a man   
 who sells logs.                       
     Because our area is so close to   
 London many people commute by train or
 car. These work in advertising,stock  
 broking,banking or are civil servants.
