		<content>{Stratton St.Margaret                  
 Stratton developed in Saxon times as  
 three villages located near the Roman 
 road of Ermin Street. Since 1950 it   
 has been swallowed up by the rapid    
 growth of the town of{Swindon.}It is  
 now an industrial suburb of Swindon.  
 Several large industrial estates are  
 located in our survey area with a     
 range of engineering and distributive 
 companies. The largest is the Austin  
 Rover Car Body plant. Much of the rest
 of Stratton consists of modern housing
 estates.                              
{South Marston                         
 South Marston is a small village      
 separated from the growth of Swindon  
 by the expanse of an airfield. The    
 development of the site by the Honda  
 car company may lead to the swallowing
 up of the village into a greater      
 Swindon.                              </content>
