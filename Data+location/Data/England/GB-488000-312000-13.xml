		<content> The church in the village is over 800 
 years old.The Tower is about 700 years
 old.As you walk into the church you go
 through a Norman door way with        
 zig-zags round it.Above you is the    
 parvise which was used by the vicar or
 monks to see who was coming to worship
 or to attack.The pulpit was made of   
 wood when King James was on the       
 throne.The round arches you can see   
 are Norman,the pointed ones are Early 
 English.There are six bells and they  
 were put up in 1660.The R.A.F. chapel 
 was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert     
 Scott and has a crest on the back     
 window.There is a screen here made by 
 a blacksmith from Whissendine called  
 Mr.Wiggington.Hanging here are flags  
 from nations whose people served at   
 R.A.F.Cottesmore during World War Two.
