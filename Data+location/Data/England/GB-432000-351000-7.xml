		<content> The original part of the vicarage     
 at Alderwasley was built in the 16th  
 century and the new part in 1893.     
         In the garden at the back of  
 the vicarage about 12 years ago the   
 present owners found a box containing 
 silver coin clippings dating back to  
 Elizabeth 1,Charles 1 and James 1     
 time. It is believed highwaymen were  
 responsible for hiding the clippings, 
 which are now in Derby Museum.        
        Alderwasley Hall was first     
 built for the Hurts Family.They owned 
 nearly all the land around.It is now  
 privately owned and used as a Boarding
 School for children with a speech     
 problem.                              
       All Saints Church was built in  
 1850 by the Hurts and was a private   
 chapel.It was for the family and      
 servants.In 1930 the villagers bought 
 it and now it is used by the village. </content>
