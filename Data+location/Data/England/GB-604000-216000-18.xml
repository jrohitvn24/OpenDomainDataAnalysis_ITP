		<title>18RIVER COLNE</title>
		<content> The survey area is composed of        
 glacial gravels overlying thick beds  
 of London Clay within which Septarian 
 Nodules occur These harden on exposure
 and were used as building stone by    
 Romans and Normans.                   
  The flint gravels originated as      
 extensive outwash deposits laid down  
 by the melting ice-sheets which       
 extended towards this area 900,000    
 years ago.                            
  The Colne Valley was carved deeply   
 into the London clay by outwash rivers
 adjusted to a lower sea-level.        
  The Post-Glacial rise in sea-level   
 led to the drowning of the valley to  
 form a branching estuary or RIA.      
  The whole Essex coastline is sinking 
 at one inch in a hundred years. This  
 is the delayed isostatic sinking      
 compensating for the rise in Scotland-
 the main source area of the ice-sheets</content>
