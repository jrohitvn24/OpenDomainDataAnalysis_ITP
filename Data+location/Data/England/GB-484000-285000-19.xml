		<title>19BUILDING ON DANESHOLME</title>
		<content> Building on Danesholme started about  
 15 years ago.There is no more room for
 houses so more private housing is     
 being built near{Great Oakley,}and    
 some people are moving there from     
 Danesholme.                           
 Before you build the house the ground 
 is flattened using machinery.Pegs are 
 put into the ground where the         
 foundations are going to be,and string
 is tied round them.The walls are built
 up to floor level and the{damp proof  
{course}is put in.                     
 There are 2 walls with a{cavity}in    
 between.When the walls are high enough
 wooden beams are placed for the       
 ceiling.Roof timbers are triangle     
 shaped,because it is stronger.        
{Waterproof}material and tiles are     
 then placed on top.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
