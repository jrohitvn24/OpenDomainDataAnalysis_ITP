 Commondale lies at the junction of    
 three narrow valleys of Sleddale Beck,
 Raven Gill and Whiteley Beck,         
 surrounded by rough open moorland,    
 rising from 150m in the south to 325m 
 in the north west.                    
                                       
 Population 90, are commuter families  
 from industrial Tesside 20 miles away 
 and hill farmers scattered around the 
 village.  Lower land is enclosed by   
 dry stone walls for arable grazing.   
 Some commercial coniferous            
 afforestation.  Communications via    
 unfenced roads, often blocked by      
 winter snow, infrequent bus service   
 one mile away and by railway.         
 Peaceful unspoilt open habitat        
 supports much wild life.  Birds       
 include grouse, pheasant, curlew,     
 falcon, rook, plovers and gulls.      </content>
