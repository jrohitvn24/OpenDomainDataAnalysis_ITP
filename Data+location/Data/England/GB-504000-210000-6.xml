		<content> We walked to Mrs.Jefferies' and       
 Mr.Badcock's houses, near Chequer's   
 End, on the left. Mrs. Jefferies' is  
{original inside,}Mr.Badcock's{original
{outside.}Both are several cottages    
 knocked together. There were other    
 houses like these on Gaddesden Row    
 which have now gone, including school 
 cottages. There was a timber house    
 where the{Golden Parsonage}stands.    
 There is a dry well 4.5m deep in Mrs. 
 Jefferies' cellar. You can also see a 
 smoke bay and{wattle and daub.}The    
 daub was made of lime, cow manure, cow
 hair, straw, cat's and horse hair.    
 There is a hinged flap of wood which  
 covered the window hole. There were   
 Roman numerals on the beams. The      
 builders matched numeral to numeral   
 when building the house. Part was     
 built 400yrs.ago. One house has a     
{Queen beam}which holds the house up.  </content>
