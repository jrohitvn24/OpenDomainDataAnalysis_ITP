		<title>07Hatfield Heath Festival (1)</title>
		<content> The Hatfield Heath Festival has taken 
 place every year in the middle of     
 June since 1969.  It is held on the   
 village heath and is the main         
 fund-raising event in aid of the      
 Village Hall and Institute, raising   
 several thousands of pounds. A special
 committee is set up to deal with the  
 organisation of the festival. Many of 
 the villagers are involved in this.   
 They make craft items and cakes to    
 sell and some grow produce and plants.
 A marquee is erected and is used for  
 refreshments over the weekend period. 
 There are many different stalls with  
 games you can play and things to buy. 
 The grand draw attracts many customers
 and there are many big prizes donated 
 by local organisations and others.    
 The first prize is normally a sum of  
 money such as Â£100.
