 When John Leach was looking for a     
 suitable property to carry on his     
 craft he wanted  somewhere that would 
 be peaceful.He found his ideal in a   
 low,stone and thatch cottage south of 
 Muchelney.The cottage used to be a    
 farm labourers home but it now houses 
 Mr Leach's family and the pottery     
 workshops.There are two workrooms,the 
 clayroom and the throwing room. Behind
 the house is the firing shed and the  
 small shop where the pottery is       
 displayed and sold.The clay used is   
 from Devon and is woodfired to produce
 a stoneware pottery for everyday      
 domestic use.John and his assistant   
 Nick work side_by_side preparing      
 clay,throwing pots and preparing the  
 kilns for firing.This task takes over 
 24 hours,is hot,tiring,allowing little
 time for sleep.                       </content>
