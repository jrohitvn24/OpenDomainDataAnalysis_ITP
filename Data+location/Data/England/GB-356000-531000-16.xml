		<content> The Eden valley area around Langwathby
 is a caring community.Many families   
 have lived here for generations and   
 most people are known to each other.If
 you are ill or need help there is     
 always someone near.The Fell Runner is
 a community mini bus which is driven  
 by volunteers.It has a weekly visiting
 run to Carlisle hospitals.It runs     
 guided tours in the summer.It takes   
 people further afield for guided walks
 to Cow Green,Teesdale and Dufton.We   
 can hire it for our own use.A car     
 service uses private cars for trans-  
 port to Doctor,Dentist or Hospital if 
 needed.The Memo is a news sheet which 
 is delivered to all houses in the area
 It gives details of activities and all
 can contribute.Meals on wheels go out 
 once a week from school.Neighbour Hood
 Watch is the latest scheme although we
 have always done this unoffically.    </content>
