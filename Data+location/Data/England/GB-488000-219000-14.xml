		<title>14The Flying Farmer</title>
		<content> The present occupant of Ledburn Farm, 
 who has leased it since 1968, uses    
 part of the ground as a {landing strip
 for his own Cessna 'plane, which he   
 shares with another man in Leighton   
 Buzzard - his third partner in the six
 years since the 'plane was purchased. 
 He uses the 'plane for business and   
 pleasure and he says it is no more    
 expensive to run than a Range Rover,  
 doing 20 miles to the gallon and, of  
 course, it saves a lot of time on many
 journeys. The 'plane is 24 years old. 
 The farmer learned to fly in 1975 and 
 now his son is learning as well. The  
 farmhouse was built about 80 years ago
 and the farm belongs to a trust       
 administered by the Society of        
 Merchant Venturers in Bristol, who    
 bought it from Lord Rosebery of       
 Mentmore in 1945.
