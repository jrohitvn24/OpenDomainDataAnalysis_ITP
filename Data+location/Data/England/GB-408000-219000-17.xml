		<content> Notgrove's Anglican Parish Church of  
 St. Bartholomew is regularly attended 
 by a congregation of about 15 for the 
 three Church Services per month. First
 Sunday is Evensong at 6pm, Second     
 Sunday is a Family Service and the    
 Fourth Sunday is Holy Communion, both 
 at 10am. The Reverend James Hughs, who
 lives in the next village of Cold     
 Aston officiates, and is much loved by
 the villagers. He fears that when he  
 retires, which may be soon, the 3     
 parishes he administers will be split,
 and each added to neighbouring        
 Livings. For Mothers union and Sunday 
 School, parishioners have to leave the
 village.                              
 Roman Catholics, Baptists and         
 Methodists have to travel to Bourton- 
 on-the-Water, a distance of about 6km.
