		<content> The area of study contains a wide     
 variety of physical and man_made      
 features, ranging from Bath central   
 district to the rural_urban fringe.The
 Kennet and Avon canal flows through   
 the area and the river Avon flows     
 westwards towards Bristol and         
 Avonmouth.Flat land,the river flood   
 plain, has been used for building and 
 extensive engineering works ensure    
 that the central area of Bath is now  
 free from flooding. The sports fields 
 provide a change from an otherwise    
 densely built up area and this site   
 (the Recreation Ground _ the home of  
 Bath RFC and County cricket) was also 
 designated for the building of the    
 Sports and Leisure centre.All types of
 housing are represented, from GEORGIAN
 to modern flats and apartments. The   
 BATH PRESERVATION TRUST has ensured   
 that the styles conform.              </content>
