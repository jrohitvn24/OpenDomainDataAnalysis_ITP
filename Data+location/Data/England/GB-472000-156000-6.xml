		<content>  The hamlets have a long history &amp; a  
 wealth of older dwellings, some of    
 which are C.16th.{Bricks are the local
{building material}but there are many  
 examples of{half timbered cottages,   
 some with thatched roofs &amp; some       
 disguised with rendering &amp; whitewash. 
 Between the hamlets are the many      
 scattered farmhouses, largely C.17th. 
 Then there are the{big houses}set in  
 several acres of grounds. West Green  
 House is now a National Trust property
 but there are also Hazeley House,     
 Inholmes Court, The Dutch House &amp;     
 Hartley Grange (now flats).           
   On the eastern edge of the block are
 the outskirts of Hartley Wintney      
 including a{modern development}of     
 larger detached houses. There are also
 a few{council owned properties}within 
 the block.                            
                                       </content>
