		<title>19Interview with Rev.Richards</title>
		<content>   The{Rev.Dan Richards}vicar,moved    
 here with his wife(a supply teacher)  
 and 3 young sons{from Slough}5 years  
 ago. His home town is Bath.He finds   
 this small rural village very         
 different from industrial Slough with 
 its multi-cultural population.        
   The vicar  has{5 churches}to look   
 after in Ilchester,Yeovilton,Podimore,
 Limington and Northover.But{Northover 
 is likely{to close}soon. Maybe it will
 then become a{museum}for all the Roman
 finds in Ilchester or perhaps it will 
 be a{folk and craft centre.           
   On average the vicar travels{50     
{miles}a week visiting his churches and
 parishioners, but for diocesan        
 meetings this may rise to 150 miles.  
 Mostly the Rev. Richards uses his{car 
 but he may be seen on his{bicycle}for 
 local visits.Only 2 churches have     
{bells,}Ilchester(5) and Limington(6). </content>
