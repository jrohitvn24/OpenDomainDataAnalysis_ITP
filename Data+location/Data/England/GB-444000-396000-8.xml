		<title>08KILNHURST VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   Kilnhurst is a small village at the 
 side of the River Don.  There are     
 three bridges in the village and these
 pass over the river, the canal and a  
 railway line which run side by side,  
 and another railway line.             
   The school which was built in 1880  
 stands on the banks of the river at   
 one end of the village.  The main road
 through the village passes the school,
 and along this road are the shops and 
 a garage.                             
   As well as a working men's club,    
 there are three pubs; these are The   
 Terrace, The Ship and The Commercial. 
 The area around these pubs is mostly  
 industrial (metal manufacturing)      
 except for the school.                
   At the far end of the village is St.
 Thomas's Church with its new vicarage;
 the old one now being an old people's 
 nursing home.                         </content>
