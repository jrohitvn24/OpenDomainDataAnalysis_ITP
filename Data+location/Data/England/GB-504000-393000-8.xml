		<content> There are only 2 industries within the
 area both agriculturally based-the Saw
 Mills and the Old Forge.The Saw Mills 
 buy in home grown wood of all types   
 and the 5-6 self-employed workers make
 and erect whatever is required eg trad
 -itional Lincolnshire fencing with oak
 posts and larch rails,garden fencing  
 panels,field gates,garden sheds and   
 stables and firewood.Sawdust and waste
 wood are now heating glass-houses to  
 raise plants for sale.   What was once
 the Blacksmith's is now a thriving bus
 -iness inventing and making machinery,
 such as the new pea and bean washer,  
 for the vegetable processing market.A 
 cauliflower floretting mach.is now at 
 work in S.Africa,Israel,Turkey,France 
 and Portugal as well as throughout the
 United Kingdom.The work force of 10 is
 also happy to mend older machines or  
 indeed weld a broken lawnmower part.  </content>
