    Most of the people who live here   
leave the village to work,many         
travelling by car to Ipswich,          
Colchester or Brantham. Quite a few    
people commute to London catching a    
train from Ipswich or Manningtree.The  
journey takes about an hour and the    
line was electrified this year.Others  
travel to London by car along the A12. 
    There are few opportunities for    
employment within the area itself.Some 
men are farm labourers and Mr Lee      
employs 2 part time workers in his     
shop.The school secretary ,headmaster  
and ancillary helper all live locally. 
The only local firm is Doubles         
Eng.Works on the outskirts of the      
village.They do general welding jobs   
and employ 7 full time and 4 casual    
workers who travel in from surrounding 
villages e.g.Freston and Bentley.      </content>
