		<title>17THE RIVER NAILBOURNE  BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The Nailbourne River is a chalk stream
 which flows every now and again.It    
 starts at Lyminge and flows into the  
 River Stour at Plucks Gutter.The      
 Nailbourne flows through{Bourne       
{Park,Bridge,Patrixbourne}and{         
{Bekesbourne.}In Bourne Park there is  
 an old sheep dip.It is sealed off from
 the river by a brick wall.The sheep   
 got in and out by some steps at the   
 side.The sheep dip is not used anymore
 Cows and sheep drink out of the       
 Nailbourne.                           
 We found out that the river flows     
 towards the North East.The river flows
 10 metres in 15 seconds.We did the    
 measurements by the bridge that leads 
 into the Recreation Ground  at        
 Bridge.There the Nailbourne is 11cm   
 deep at each side and 8cm deep in the 
 middle.And is 4.50 metres wide.
