The handcuffs are put on prisoners,    
usually men, although sometimes on     
women if they are very violent, to     
transport them from one place to       
another.  The handcuffs are never put  
on children.  P.C. Walker used to have 
a whistle until 1983.  He is not       
allowed a second job because policemen 
have to be totally committed officers. 
                                       
The policehouse was built in 1971 and  
the police station is actually a room  
within P.C. Walker's house.  To contact
police in Boxford you do not dial 999  
but the house phone number.  There is  
no cell at the police house and unlike 
town police, P.C. Walker has just a    
bicycle.
