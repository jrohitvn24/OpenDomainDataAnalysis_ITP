		<title>16Police Holiday Scheme</title>
		<content>The Police SPACE scheme is a scheme run
by the Police for children under the   
age of 16. The reason why the Police   
started this scheme is because most    
children get bored during the six week 
holiday. There are lots of activities  
involved and also many trips.          
Activities include Superstars held at  
the High School, golf tuition so you   
can improve on your golf and indoor and
outdoor games like tennis and cricket. 
Everyone enjoys it and at the end there
is a presentation of certificates and  
some little medals for the ones who won
the fishing competition. Finally there 
is a big trophy which I won two years  
ago for the most sporting person.      
There are other play schemes for       
children during the summer holidays in 
Penkridge.
