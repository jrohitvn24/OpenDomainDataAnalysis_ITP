		<content> The Alexander Keiller museum in       
 Avebury houses exhibits that represent
 daily life around Avebury 5000 years  
 ago. It contains a particularly       
 impressive exhibition of skeletons.   
 The huge 17th century barn fell into  
 disuse with the breaking up of the    
 Manor estate early this century. In   
 1979 the Great Barn was opened to the 
 public,after being fully restored, as 
 the museum of {The Wiltshire Folk     
{Life Society}. An old cow shed next to
 the barn has recently been converted  
 into an educational centre. Nine      
 apprentices from a local construction 
 company have carried out the work     
 which took them three months.Each     
 apprentice had a specialist trade     
 although everyone mucked in and       
 helped. A plaque was unveiled and each
 of the apprentices were given a       
 tankard at the handing over ceremony. </content>
