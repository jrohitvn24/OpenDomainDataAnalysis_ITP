 In 1952 Mobberley W.I. entered a      
 competition organised by Cheshire     
 Federation and won first prize with a 
 book entitled 'A History of Mobberley'
 which was later published.            
{MORRIS DANCERS.  }                    
 The Ringheye Morris Troupe derive     
 their name from the old Parish in     
 which Ringway is located. Ringheye is 
 also the name of a dance movement. The
 Morris dancers practice in Pepper     
 Street Chapel every Wednesday evening.
 They are a mixed team and wear clogs  
 following the tradition of the N.West.
 They have been instrumental in        
 reviving some of the old customs of   
 the area. They have written and       
 perform a 'Souling Play' which takes  
 place on November 1st and they would  
 also like to revive the custom of     
 'Crabbing' the Parson.                </content>
