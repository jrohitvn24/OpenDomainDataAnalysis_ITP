 Thakeham Tiles was founded in 1933 by 
 a Mr King to make roof tiles.         
 Re-opening after the war the site     
 covered an area of eleven acres       
 although only five are used for       
 manufacturing purposes.  Roof tiles   
 are no longer made; paving slabs,     
 building blocks and decorative wall   
 blocks being produced instead.        
 Approximately 2500 plain and decorated
 paving slabs and 10700 cavity and     
 solid building blocks are made each   
 day, most of them by hand. Sixty      
 people are employed, thirty eight of  
 whom actually make the slabs and      
 blocks. The working day is 8 hours    
 long, beginning at 7.30.  The product 
 is sold to retail outlets all over the
 south east of England.
