 There is very little industry in this 
 area.Most residents commute to the    
 nearby towns of Matlock,Chesterfield  
 and Sheffield.The Milltown Claycross  
 Iron and Foundries Company used to    
 mine fluorspar.The company now uses   
 the site as a flotation plant where   
 fluorspar and barytes from            
 elsewhere,including parts of          
 Derbyshire,are brought in and         
 processed.The minerals are then sold  
 to other companies.Only a few people  
 are employed at this plant.           
 We were told that there are still a   
 few uncapped shafts from lead-mining  
 days. One mineral works closed in     
 recent years and the offices converted
 into houses.
