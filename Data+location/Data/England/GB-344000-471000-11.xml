		<content> The skilfully constructed tall chimney
 of limestone which stands on the      
 shoreline at Jenny Brown's point is   
 the only remains of a copper smelting 
 works established at the end of the   
 18th century. A deep channel enabled  
 shipping to dock at the jetty,        
 conveying machinery for the           
 enterprise. Copper ore came from      
 workings at Crag Foot, established in 
 the days of the first Elizabeth. The  
 nearby quarry provided stone for the  
 breakwater, built to reclaim          
 marshland. Mr A Shepherd of The Cove  
 petitioned against the scheme, and    
 later upheld via the House of Lords.  
 The scheme was abandoned. During the  
 last war the RAF used the area for    
 bombing practice. An observer tower on
 the jetty was removed by the Air      
 Ministry when it was vandalised.
