is used for cutting the outfield and   
the car park.There is a large roller   
which  is rolled over the wicket to    
make the ground level.The wicket is    
mown with a lawnmower which cuts the   
grass very  low.There is a spiker for  
punching  holes in the ground so that  
the pitch will drain, and a line       
marker  which is used to mark the      
boundary.There are two big metal       
covers, nets for pracising and two     
sight screens. The players have lunch  
and tea in the pavillion.Stone
