 ** MODELLING IN BLINDCRAKE IN 1985 ** 
                                       
   Traditional modelling materials eg  
 wood and metal have now been largely  
 superceeded by plastic in its many    
 forms. Several people in the village  
 make model aeroplanes with Balsa wood 
 construction but fibreglass fuselages 
 and foam polystyrene wings covered in 
 veneer are much quicker to build at   
 about the same cost. Most models are  
 Radio Controlled.                     
   Plastic static models are popular as
 are model railways. Trains are made   
 from white metal or etched brass kits.
   The greatest difficulty in modelling
 here is the long distance needed to   
 travel to obtain kits or materials.   
 Using the post is often quicker and   
 cheaper!
