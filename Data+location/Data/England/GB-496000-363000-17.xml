		<content>   The Wing Commander rises at 6.45am  
 and after washing has a breakfast of  
 coffee, grapefruit, scrambled-eggs,   
 sausage, marmalade on toast and more  
 coffee. He drives to work and arrives 
 in the office around 8.00am. The Wing 
 Commander's first job is to read all  
 the signals that have come in over the
 night and then he answers the morning 
 letters. Around 10.00am there is      
 usually a meeting. For instance an    
 inspection might be planned. Lunchtime
 should be 90 minutes but the Wing     
 Commander takes only half an hour. The
 afternoon is usually spent writing    
 letters and talking on the telephone. 
 Around 6.00pm the Wing Commander takes
 a jog around the sports field and then
 eats in the officers' mess. Then it is
 back to the office for more desk work 
 before having a shower and retiring   
 to bed at 10.30pm.                    </content>
