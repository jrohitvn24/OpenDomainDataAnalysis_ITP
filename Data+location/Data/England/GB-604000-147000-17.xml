		<content> Chancellor of England and founder of  
 Wye College of Secular Priests was    
 born. After the Kempes the house was  
 lived in by the Thornhills, Royalists 
 in the Civil War. Lady Joanna         
 Thornhill is still remembered in Wye  
 as the benefactor of the primary      
 school. The next owners till this     
 century were the Sawbridges who after 
 the house caught fire in the late     
 nineteenth century moved to Bilting   
 House. The early members of this      
 family were somewhat eccentric. One   
 was associated with the South Sea     
 Bubble and various members of the     
 family represented Canterbury at      
 Parliament. Throughout this century   
 the house has been occupied by the    
 Loudon family. Mr. F.W.H. Loudon was  
 high sheriff of Kent in 1969 and died 
 in August 1985. His son, Mr. James    
 Loudon lives there now.               </content>
