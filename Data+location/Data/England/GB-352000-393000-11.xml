		<content>     Our final question was "Are there 
 any plans for the future development  
 of the valley." The  secretary  said, 
 "There  are  no  future  plans."  We  
 thanked  the secretary and the ranger 
 and  went  to question some people in 
 the valley. The  first  people we saw 
 were  two  old men walking their dogs.
 We  asked  them  what they thought of 
 the valley and what  could be done to 
 improve it. The first old man replied,
 "They could improve it by dredging the
 canal once in a while and by stocking 
 it with fish."  The  second  old  man 
 said,  "This  place  would  be  a lot 
 better if  something  could  be  done 
 about the vandalism. Next we asked a  
 middle-aged man the same questions, he
 said he liked the  canal  as  it  was 
 but he would  like a reduction in the 
 amount of vandalism.
