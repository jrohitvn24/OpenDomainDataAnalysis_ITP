		<content> We interviewed Mr.Mosley at {Woodhead 
{Farm.}The farm land is mostly silage  
 and rough grazing. The farm has a     
 milking machine in an abreast milking 
 parlour. It milks three cows at a     
 time.The cows are automatically fed by
 a machine that lets nuts drop from a  
 loft above.These nuts cost one penny  
 each. Cows are fed individual amounts.
                                       
  Mr.Mosley's dad had to do the work by
 hand. He had four horses for pulling  
 different machines. Mr.Mosley likes   
 driving the tractor in the fields.    
 Tractors must have a protective cab   
 and are quiet enough now to have a    
 radio.                                
                                       
  At{Highfield Farm}they have computer-
 worked collars round the cows' necks  
 to tell how much food they need and   
 show the amount of milk given.        </content>
