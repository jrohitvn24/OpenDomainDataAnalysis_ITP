		<content>      At West Bay is the modern church 
 of St. John built in 1936. This       
 intimate building is known as the     
 Fishermen's Church and has Holy       
 Communion Services on Sunday at 9.30  
 a.m. and Thursday at 7.30 a.m. It is  
 served by the Team Ministry, but      
 there are a number of retired         
 clergymen living in West Bay who give 
 their services from time to time.     
      The Congregational Church in East
 Street now houses the United Reform   
 Church, and Methodists also worship   
 here in a recently refurbished        
 interior. It was built in 1662 and    
 seats over 800 people.                
      The Friends' Meeting House       
 in South Street is the oldest         
 non-conformist place of worship,      
 built in 1697.
