		<title>08Sunday morning.</title>
		<content>I wake up much later than normal on    
Sunday,usually at about half-past nine 
or ten o'clock.After that I go         
downstairs and have my breakfast which 
consists of cereal, toast and orange   
juice.                                 
 After breakfast I prepare to go to the
Indian Temple which is the only place  
for our religion to worship.Everybody  
in our family goes to the temple.We    
usually leave at about eleven o'clock. 
Sometimes we have our lunch at the     
temple which is free.                  
 We come home and usually read or watch
television.                            
 At home we usually use the English    
language, but at the Temple we use     
Indian.We always go to the Temple on   
Sunday
