		<content>Around the tube station are shops      
including florists, grocers and some   
clothes shops, but there is no super-  
market. THe pet shop sells supplies but
not pets.Indian people own most of the 
shops but Daley Thompson's brother owns
one. There are no pubs because Quakers 
own the land who do not like drinking. 
There are no factories so it is fairly 
quiet, except when Wimbledon Tennis    
comes.Lots of taxis are about then and 
lots of stalls open up selling         
Wimbledon T-shirts.Fifty years ago     
there was farming land now a housing   
estate.There is a boys' club next to   
the Post Office and there is also a    
Cubs group.There is one Bingo Hall and 
at the top of Augustus Rd St. Paul's   
Anglican church has a youth            
club.During Sunday Services children   
can play in a separate room.
