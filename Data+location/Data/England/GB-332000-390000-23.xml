<title>23The River Mersey</title>
<content>Industrial ships no longer reach the City Centre as they all now dock in Bootle. The ferries across the Mersey are still in use but are more of a tourist attraction than used as a functional means of transport as it was in the past. The presence of tourism is in this area has seen commercial opportunities arise and there are now two museums (one opening this year- the first new museum built in the country for over 100 years) and various children's activity centres. It is a much quieter scene on the riverside now and the link up of the Leeds Liverpool canal has seen the area develop into a much more leisurely area rather than industrial.&lt;br />
