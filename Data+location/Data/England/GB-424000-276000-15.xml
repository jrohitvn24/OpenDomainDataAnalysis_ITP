		<title>15PROPOSED NEW COAL MINE</title>
		<content> In south west Coventry there is       
 concern over the possible siting of   
 the Â£450million Warwickshire super    
 pit. This should go into production in
 about 11 years time, mining 3 million 
 tons of coal a year. About 1 3/4      
 million tons will go in 10 trainloads 
 a day to power stations, with 1 1/4   
 million tons going by road in up to   
 510 lorries a day. British Rail will  
 probably re-open the old disused      
 branch line between Berkswell and     
 Crackley Junction near Kenilworth on  
 the Coventry to Oxford line. The      
 trains could leave the pit without    
 interfering with high speed trains.   
 The lorries are likely to cause most  
 alarm to local people as most of the  
 lanes in the area are winding country 
 lanes. A new link road to the A45     
 would need to be built to take the    
 bulk of this traffic.                 </content>
