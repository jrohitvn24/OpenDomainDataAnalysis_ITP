		<content>     The first time you meet someone in
 Darfield the first thing you will     
 notice will be the way they speak.    
 Nearly everyone in Darfield speaks    
 broad Yorkshire; and it takes people  
 from other towns a long time to       
 understand us well.We tend to shorten 
 words and have special words for      
 everyday things e.g. Spice means      
 sweets, Spell means splinter, Ginnel  
 means alleyway.Also we pronounce      
 vowels differently saying both vowels 
 seperately in words like soup and     
 dead.The local people use 'tha' and   
 'thee' meaning 'you'.                 
     In our local paper there is a     
 section written in broad Yorkshire,it 
 is always very funny.                 
     Some people do not like the way we
 speak,but I think it is nice and makes
 Darfield different.
