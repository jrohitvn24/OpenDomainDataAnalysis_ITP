		<title>17THE RENTED PIGS</title>
		<content> I wrote this poem after I had seen the
 pigs at Park House Farm, Layer Marney.
 The man who owns the pigs rents a barn
 from Mr. Strathern, of Park House     
 Farm.                                 
                                       
                                       
 The curly tails of the rented pigs,   
 And their wet and runny noses.        
 Their noses are the cleanest part     
 Of the bodies that they have.         
 The dirty patches on their backs      
 Where they've rolled in puddles.      
 Their stubby legs                     
 Their large pink ears.                
 That only means they're grubby, dirty,
 snuffly, grunting, pink piggies.      
                                       
                   Esther Smith.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
