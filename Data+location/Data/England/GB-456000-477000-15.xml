		<title>15Ampleforth Schola Cantorum.</title>
		<content>  The Ampleforth Schola Cantorum sing  
 Church Music at Abbey services on     
 Fridays and Sundays during term time. 
 They rehearse on Wednesdays and before
 each service. The choir is made up of 
 boys and Monks from the college. The  
 trebles come from Junior House. The   
 majority of pieces are accompanied on 
 an organ and conducted by the Director
 of Music.                             
  Concerts are held regularly in the   
 Abbey and other Cathedrals, churches  
 or colleges. The Schola has made a    
 number of European tours.             
  The Schola wear red cassocks for     
 services and most concerts. There are 
 two Head Choristers chosen by the     
 Director of Music each year for their 
 singing ability. They then choose     
 their Deputies.
