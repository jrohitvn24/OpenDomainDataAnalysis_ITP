		<title>15Recreational Facilities</title>
		<content> There are no children's playgrounds or
 other such recreational facilities in 
 either of the villages of Beswick or  
 Watton. The nearest such playground,  
 incorporating swings, slide, climbing 
 frames and roundabout, is about two   
 miles away at Hutton Cranswick.       
 Further playgrounds can be found in   
 both Beverley and Driffield.          
 Beswick Amateur Football Club         
 presently run two teams in the local  
 Driffield League. Their home pitch is 
 situated in a field belonging to Mr.  
 D.J. Duggleby of Beswick - map ref.   
 (05012,04478), changing facilities    
 being available just across the       
 village road.                         
 Of the 30 or so registered players    
 only two live locally, although       
 several others have immediate or more 
 distant family living in or near the  
 village.                              </content>
