 The age group 10 - 19 is poorly served
despite there being brass band, choir, 
scouts &amp; guides taking place in the    
evenings.                              
 What is required is a permanent       
meeting place open every evening where 
young people can chat, listen to       
records or just do nothing in the warm 
and dry. A youth centre would be super 
but a coffee bar would do.             
 Most of us don't want to join         
organisations and have things we've    
"Got to do".                           
 Some people like the idea of a BMX    
track, but this would only be for      
daylight hours and anyway, BMX might   
only last a year or two, like the last 
craze.. skateboarding.
