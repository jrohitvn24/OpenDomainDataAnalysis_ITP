		<content> THE Kennet &amp; Avon Canal is the sole   
 surviving waterway across southern    
 England.  Completed 1810 linking      
 Reading/Bristol (87\ miles).  It's    
 initial success promoting trade for   
 agricultural products, coal, timber,  
 etc. was shortlived because of Great  
 Western Railway and subsequently      
 growth of road traffic following 1st  
 World War.  Despite disuse and decay  
 Canal survived until 1950 when        
 stoppage was declared between Newbury 
 and Reading because condition was     
 considered dangerous.  Further        
 restrictions followed and Canal has   
 not been completely re-opened since.  
 1963 British Waterways Board formed   
 and its duties re: Canal included use 
 for commercial transportation and as  
 an amenity.  Restoration is underway  
 with aim of Canal being fully         
 navigable.                            </content>
