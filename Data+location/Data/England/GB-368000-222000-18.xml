		<content>{ Newent Woods,}managed by{Huntley     
{Estates,}covers 400 acres, of which   
 half lie in our block. Planted on red 
 sandstone, the trees are mainly       
{conifers}such as Douglas Fir,Lawson   
 Cypress,Western Hemrock,Giant Fir,    
 and even Californian Redwood.{Larch, a
{deciduous,}is also grown and{Sweet    
{Chestnut}as the only{hardwood.}Under- 
 planting is not possible because of   
 the dense canopy formed by conifers.  
  There is a 60 year planting/felling  
 cycle on the estate for maximum       
 efficiency. After felling,the smaller 
 material is cut by estate workers into
 fence posts for local use. The mature 
 timber is sent to saw mills in the    
 area and then on to many outlets.     
  The greatest enemy of the trees is   
 the{grey squirrel,}doing far more     
 damage than disease. There are four   
 permanent employees and two students. </content>
