		<title>10Lodge Moor Area.</title>
		<content> The Lodge Moor area is very varied.   
 It has some woodland left and is the  
 newest estate in our area.            
 We have a choice of going to 2        
 schools. They are both about a mile   
 walk.                                 
 The entertainment we have includes    
 discos at the community centre. It    
 offers everything from Bingo to Judo. 
 There is a little park on Moors road. 
 The estate has grown quickly.         
 The dwellings are mostly semi-detached
 or terraced houses.                   
 On Scotter Road there are five shops. 
 A D.I.Y. shop, Greengrocers, Bread    
 shop, Hair Dressers and a shop that   
 sells just about everything, with a   
 great name;'Bits 'n' Bobs'. It has    
 been rebuilt recently. The shops have 
 a tiny car park.                      
 Just around the corner there is a     
 small timber yard.                    </content>
