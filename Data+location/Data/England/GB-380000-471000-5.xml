		<content> For hundreds of years limestone has   
 been quarried in this area.  It was   
 used for walls, buildings and for     
 burning into lime.  The remains of    
 several old lime-kilns still exist on 
 the hillsides.                        
                                       
 In the past, Horton Quarry has        
 provided lime for agriculture and for 
 the steel industry.  This year the oil
 burning kilns were demolished.        
 Limestone for agricultural purposes is
 still produced (crushed, not burnt) at
 the quarry, but the extraction of     
 limestone is principally for the      
 construction of roads and motorways.  
                                       
 Although the quarry is connected by   
 sidings to the railway, stone is      
 transported by road, resulting in     
 local road widening schemes and       
 employment for local lorry drivers.   </content>
