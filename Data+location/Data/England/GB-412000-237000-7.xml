		<content> The people of Campden are represented 
 on the{Parish Council }by townsfolk   
 who live within 3 miles of the Town   
 Hall chosen by election. The town is  
 divided into three wards:-Upper-from  
 the middle of the High St westwards-  
 Lower -from the High St to the        
 junction of Kingcombe and Aston Rd and
 Broad Ward covering Broad Campden.    
 There are ten members and the Mayor.  
 The clerk to the council has the      
 salaried post. Meetings are held every
 fortnight. The public are allowed to  
 attend but not to speak unless asked. 
 Once a year there is a Assembly when  
 all residents can address the meeting.
 The powers of the P.C. are limited to 
 lighting,footpaths and car parks but  
 they do have an important part to play
 advising the District Council on      
 planning matters and keeping Campden  
 from being spoilt by greedy developers</content>
