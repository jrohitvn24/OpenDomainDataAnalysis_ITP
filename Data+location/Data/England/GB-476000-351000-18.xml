		<content> Mr. and Mrs. Hyde have been telling us
 about Farndon. Mr. Hyde was born in   
 Farndon 68 years ago. The house he    
 lived in is still there. Mrs. Hyde is 
 62 and she used to live in Alpine     
 Lodge. It was the last house in Marsh 
 Lane; all the rest was taken up by    
 fields. There was no recreation       
 ground then and there used to be a    
 football pitch where the pits are now.
 They took gravel from the pits to make
 runways. Four of Mr. Hyde's brothers  
 sang in the choir, 2 in the men's and 
 2 in the boy's. In the school there   
 were 3 classes. The toilets were      
 outside and they had no wash basins.  
 They had saved up to ave their        
 playground tarmaced and it cost only  
 twelve old pence!
