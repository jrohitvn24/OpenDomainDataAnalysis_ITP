		<title>11SENIOR CITIZEN OF BARCOMBE.</title>
		<content>{A report by Zoe Stenning.             
  The following are comments about     
 living in Barcombe today, by Mrs.     
 Pratt a senior citizen of the village:
 Things have changed a great deal since
 I was at school.However some things   
 are the same like stoolball, netball  
 and tennis, which we used to play. The
 price and value of money has changed a
 lot. The price of food is much higher 
 and I remember when I worked for ten  
 shillings a day.Food itself has       
 changed because most of it is frozen  
 now. Houses have changed and are now  
 modernized. For example we have a     
 bathroom and toilet upstairs.I like   
 living in Barcombe very much because  
 it is nice and peaceful with not much 
 traffic.I much prefer the countryside 
 and would never move away.
