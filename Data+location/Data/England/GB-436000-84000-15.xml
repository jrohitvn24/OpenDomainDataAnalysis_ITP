		<title>15THE MILITARY ROAD.</title>
		<content>   The{MILITARY ROAD}is in the         
 south_east of the{ISLE OF WIGHT.      
 It was built in World WarII by German 
 prisoners of war.The road runs from   
{BLACKGANG}to{FRESHWATER,}along the    
 length of the ISLE OF WIGHT.          
   The road is built in a geologically 
 unstable area and therefore needs     
 constant repairs and upkeep.It a great
 matter of concern for the people on   
 the ISLE OF WIGHT.The road is allowed 
 to survive because it would be very   
 expensive and time consuming to build 
 another.                              
   Even though the area is unsafe the  
 road is popular with motorists and    
 thus its demise is not forseeable, and
 it remains the only major road in the 
 area.
