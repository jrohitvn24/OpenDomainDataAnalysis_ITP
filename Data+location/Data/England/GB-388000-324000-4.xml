		<title>04No more roads works in 1985.</title>
		<content>Drivers have been assured that there   
will be no major road works on the     
Staffordshire stretch of the M6 before 
April next year (1986).                
This will be the first year since 1976 
that motorists,have not had to worry   
about delays and tailbacks caused by   
motorways maintenance.                 
The entire Staffordshire section of the
M6 has been reconstructed since 1976,  
apart from a section of flexible       
constuction between Gailey and junction
11 at Shareshill and a concrete stretch
linking junction 13 at Dunston and     
junction 12 at Gailey which is still in
good condition.A spokesman for         
Staffordshire County Council said the  
only work to be carried out this year  
would be a contract to replace some    
badly deteriorated sections on the     
southbound carriageway at Waltons Wood.
