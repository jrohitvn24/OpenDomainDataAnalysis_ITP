		<content> This is a hilly area, rising from 600'
 to 1300'. The soil is fertile old red 
 sandstone and arable crops, grass and 
 deciduous trees are growing over      
 almost the entire area. There is some 
 Forestry Commission coniferous forest 
 in the North East Corner.             
 The main occupation is mixed farming, 
 with three farms dominating the area, 
 namely Bicton, Guilden Down and       
 Llanhedric. The grazing livestock are 
 single suckled beef cows and sheep    
 producing fat lambs. As the soil is so
 fertile about 25% of the land area is 
 used to grow arable crops,            
 predominantly cereals. This part of   
 South West Shropshire has changed very
 little over the years and is much the 
 same in the 1980s as it was 50 years  
 ago. For this reason and being an area
 of outstanding natural beauty many    
 visitors come to enjoy the peace      </content>
