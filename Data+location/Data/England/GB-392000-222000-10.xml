 Aelf's tun or settlement. A Saxon     
 field name survives in{"Rowanfield", }
 meaning the field where two hay har-  
 vests were cut annually. Nearby Monks 
 croft was named after Richard Munke   
 who,as a tenant, is mentioned in a    
 document dated 1334. Much of the land 
 was in Alstone Tything, an early manor
 later removed and rebuilt near the    
 reservoir on the A40 near Cheltenham. 
  Dr Jenner's country house (nick-named
 the Pest House)is now Purchasing and  
 Cost Office of Spirax Sarco. Victorian
 cottage, originally a bakery, has dis-
 used door under roof with no outside  
 access. Grain stored in barn, where   
 Golden Miller Pub is now, was hoisted 
 up through it. Oven in cellar removed 
 but foundations still visible.
