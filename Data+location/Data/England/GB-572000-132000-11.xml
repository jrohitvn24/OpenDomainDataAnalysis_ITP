		<title>11OLD RAILWAY, BEDGEBURY AREA</title>
		<content>   A single-track railway was built    
 from Paddock Wood to Hawkhurst in the 
 1890's, the Cranbrook and Hawkhurst   
 stations being 2-3 km from the town   
 centres. This was one of several small
 railways managed by Colonel Stephens. 
   The line closed in 1961.  Cranbrook 
 station house has since been used as a
 pottery but is now empty.             
   The top hectare of the old Cranbrook
 station yard is leased by an oil      
 company whose offices are in the      
 engine shed, a listed building.  The  
 other two hectares are leased to a    
 subsidiary of the National Coal Board;
 various types of coal are stored here 
 in pens built from old railway        
 sleepers.  Hawkhurst station yard is  
 used by wood turners.                 
   The dismantled railway line is now  
 in parts a Forestry Commission road, a
 footpath, and overgrown or blocked.   </content>
