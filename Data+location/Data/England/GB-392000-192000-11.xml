 found on Tetbury Lane.There are       
{plenty of amusements}available        
 to help children pass the time        
 including;two little{swings}and four  
 big ones.There is a tall{slide}and a  
{rocking horse.}Children can also run  
 and climb on the large logs and pipes 
 lying around. There is a{football     
{pitch and a cricket pitch}in the      
 middle of it. Oaksey Youth teams play 
 here.In one corner of the field is a  
 hut for the players to change in.Lots 
 of events have been held in the       
 playing field including the{donkey    
{derby}and the{WI cricket match.}
