		<content>   Approximately 200 people attend the 
 Methodist Church each week and there  
 are midweek meetings as well. People  
 at the Methodist Church are sending   
 money to help the people affected by  
 The Famine in Ethiopia. The Minister  
 at the church says that his favourite 
 story in the Bible is the Prodigal Son
 because it says Jesus will forgive us 
 whatever we do.                       
   There is a small Catholic Church    
 that has a service once a fortnight,  
 but most Catholics go into Hinckley to
 church.                               
   The Congregational Church has two   
 services on a Sunday and a Sunday     
 School. In addition there are coffee  
 mornings and other weekly activities. 
                                       
 The research for this work was done   
 by a group of 14 year olds.
