		<content> The Lizard Peninsula is an area noted 
 for its natural beauty, for its sheer 
 variety of land and seascapes, and its
 changing moods, from the raging winter
 storms to the solace of quiet days on 
 the downs or on one of its many       
 isolated coves. The beauty and variety
 of its scenery attracts artists       
 throughout the year.{The Coverack Art 
{Club}is ideally situated to take      
 advantage of this diversity of        
 scenery, and does so to the full, as  
 can be seen at its annual summer      
 exhibition. The exhibition is held in 
 St. Peter's Hall, and usually runs for
 two weeks. The variety and quality of 
 work exhibited is testimony to the    
 talent and dedication of its members, 
 who have, over the years, produced a  
 unique pictorial record depicting the 
 beauty, the tranquility, and the      
 diversity of the locality.            </content>
