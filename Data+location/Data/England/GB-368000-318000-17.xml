		<content>   Our area is largely agricultural yet
 the majority of inhabitants do not    
 work on the land. They live here      
 because they love{village life}and the
 countryside, though their work is in  
 nearby towns. In both villages the{   
{Church}plays an active part and so do 
 traditional organisations like the    
 Womens Institute, Mothers Union,      
 Guides, Brownies and Football clubs.  
 Both communities take great care of   
 the elderly and run clubs for them to 
 meet and enjoy themselves.            
   We found we had collected far too   
 much information about our area to put
 into the computer.                    
   This information was collected by   
 Form 3 of{Newport Girls' High School, 
{Shropshire,}with the help of some of  
 the Lower 6 and Mrs R Taylor, Mr W    
 Casson, Mrs S Cunningham and Mrs A    
 Warner.                               </content>
