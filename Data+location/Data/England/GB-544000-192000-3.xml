 district is one of the biggest. J has 
 four divisions: Loughton, Chigwell,   
 Woodford and Chingford. Policemen only
 carry truncheons to protect them-     
 selves.  Guns are kept for serious    
 crimes, and if they know that their   
 enemies have weapons.   They do a lot 
 of football patrolling. Child cruelty 
 is the worst thing P.C. Ryan has to   
 deal with.                            
   An eighth of the force are          
 detectives. Prisoners have escaped    
 from Police cells  in Ilford.  A      
 Discipline Code is a set of rules.    
 Policemen are fined if they let       
 prisoners go.
