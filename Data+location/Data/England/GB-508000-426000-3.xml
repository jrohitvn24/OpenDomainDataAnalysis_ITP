		<title>03IMPRESSIONS OF HULL</title>
		<content> Some 15 year olds were asked what they
 thought of Hull as a place to live.   
 The main answer given by the girls was
 "boring", mainly because there was    
 "nothing to do at night".  They do say
 that there are discos but these are   
 for those over 18 and the one run for 
 15 to 17 year olds is often very      
 rough.                                
 The shopping centre was said to be    
 quite good but most thought other     
 cities had more to offer.             
 The boys were less interested in the  
 shops and more into sport.  They      
 pointed out that Hull has two of the  
 best Rugby League teams in Britain,   
 Hull Kingston Rovers and Hull FC.  The
 area also has hundreds of amateur and 
 youth teams.                          
 All the girls and boys agreed that    
 Hull is not the  place for a holiday.
