		<content> The church of{St.Paul}at{Gorefield,   
 which was built in 1870,is a stone    
 building in the{"Early English"}style.
 It consists of a chancel,nave,vestry, 
 south porch and a west turret         
 containing one bell.The first rector  
 was Andrew Beck M.A. who stayed for 31
 years.There have been 10 further      
 rectors,and the current one is Jack   
 Tofts.The organ in the church is      
 original,and like the building,is     
 115 years old.Mr.Calver,who grew up in
 Gorefield  has been attending the     
 church since he was very young.In his 
 early days,he was an organ blower,    
 which he did twice a week for a       
 penny.Mr.Calver said that he          
 remembered when the church lighting   
 was all the way down the aisle.One of 
 the oldest books in the church is an  
 Altar service book which was printed  
 in 1928.                              </content>
