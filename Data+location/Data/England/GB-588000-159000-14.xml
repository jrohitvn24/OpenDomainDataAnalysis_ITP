		<title>14TRADE GARDEN CENTRE TUNSTALL</title>
		<content>Before the garden centre opened seven  
years ago,the buildings were owned by  
the Kent Farming Institute and were    
used for storing compost.When it first 
opened the centre covered one and a    
half acres, but now the garden centre  
covers six acres.Plants and shrubs are 
sold most to the public, which are     
brought in from several suppliers.There
are fifteen full time staff.The most   
difficult plants to grow are pot plants
because they need constant attention.  
The centre opens at 9.00am and closes  
at 5.30pm,seven days a week.In the     
summer around 1000 people visit the    
garden centre on Sundays. The garden   
centre is not a proper nursery  where  
plans are grown from seed. They only   
merchandise plants and shrubs to the   
customers, which makes some of the     
plants poor quality. Tropical fish and 
goldfish are also sold.                </content>
