		<content> It was 9.15 a.m. when our group set   
 off. We were travelling to Brightons  
 Booth Museum. We were all clutching   
 clip_boards. Little did we know that  
 the trip was to be long and tiresome. 
 We had to walk. Our route took us past
 London Road and Preston Park Station. 
 Finally we reached our destination.   
 The first thing we saw were two       
 stuffed bears standing in a glass     
 case. Inside was a dark room filled   
 with birds standing in glass cases on 
 the wall. We were surposed to keep in 
 several large groups, but everybody   
 split up in twos or threes. If we     
 could not find the case we wanted, a  
 kindly faced gentleman directed us to 
 it.                                   
 Next stop was the insects. We were    
 given an interesting lecture; mainly  
 about butterflies and moths. The      
 insects glistened as if still alive.s </content>
