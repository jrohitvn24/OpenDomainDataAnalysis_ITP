		<title>11Epworth County Primary.</title>
		<content>    We have one Primary School in our  
 village called Epworth County Primary.
 It is a very modern open plan school  
 and has only been open for about three
 years. Prior to this there were two   
 primary schools in the village both of
 which were over 100 years old.        
    The new school has approximately   
 270 children on roll and is divided   
 into four units. Units 1 and 2 are for
 infants and reception children, Unit 3
 for 1st and 2nd year juniors and Unit 
 4 for 3rd and 4th year juniors.       
    The library, sports equipment and  
 toilet facilities are all better than 
 they were at the previous schools. The
 atmosphere is very friendly and warm. 
 It is definetely warmer in winter!
