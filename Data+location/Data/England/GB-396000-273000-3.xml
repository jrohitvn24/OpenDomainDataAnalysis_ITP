		<content>{Cofton Clinic}                        
 This post_natal clinic opens once a   
 month from 14.00 to 16.00h.  The      
 babies are taken for injections such  
 as Polio and German measles.  Three   
 people work at the clinic: health     
 visitor,doctor and a state registered 
 nurse. On average 15 people attend.   
 The mothers and children can mix with 
 their own age-group. Many people have 
 changed to the newer Catshill Clinic. 
{Opinions                              
 We asked a few mothers what they      
 thought of the clinic and what could  
 be improved. The mothers agreed that  
 they would like the clinic more often,
 also they would like their family     
 doctors to be involved in the clinic.
