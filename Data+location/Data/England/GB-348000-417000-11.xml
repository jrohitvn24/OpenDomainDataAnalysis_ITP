		<title>11EDUCATION IN CROSTON</title>
		<content>{Primary:}The Methodist school has 40  
 pupils and 2 teachers. The CofE school
 has 193 pupils,the infant section in  
 the original building by the church   
 and the junior section in the grounds 
 of the High school.                   
{Secondary:}The Bishop Rawstorne High  
 School,named after a former Rector of 
 Croston and Bishop of Blackburn, was  
 opened in 1960 as a sec. mod. for 250 
 pupils.With{R.O.S.L.A.}numbers grew   
 and new buildings were built.Now 733  
 pupils attend but, because of the     
{decline in birth rate,}numbers are    
 decreasing.Originally important in    
 uniting nearby villages isolated from 
 each other, Croston children now rely 
 heavily on the school as other schools
 are 6miles away.They now have a{choice
 of state and church schools in the    
 Chorley and Leyland area.A small      
 number attend private schools outside.</content>
