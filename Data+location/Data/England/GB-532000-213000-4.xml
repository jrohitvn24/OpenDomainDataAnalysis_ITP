 farmland,a{monastery}and a few houses.
   The{Victorian mansion}was used as a 
 T.B. hospital until 1973 then an ambu-
 lance training school. In 1984 it was 
 converted into 15{luxury flats.}Each  
 has electric central heating, kitchen 
 with split_level cooker, 1_3 bedrooms,
 lounge (largest 7x5m), 1_2 bathrooms, 
 garage,security entry_phone and shared
 gardens. Prices start at Â£37500.      
   The outbuildings are being replaced 
 by{executive homes}which will cost at 
 least Â£250000 due to their large plots
 and fine parkland setting.            
   Ware Park seems to be a very{private
 place. There are many 'no-trespassing'
 signs nailed to trees and woodland is 
 fenced off to allow new trees to grow 
 for the benefit of future generations.</content>
