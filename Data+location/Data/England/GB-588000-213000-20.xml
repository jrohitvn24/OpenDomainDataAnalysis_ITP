		<title>20Wilkin Jam Factory,Tiptree</title>
		<content> Kelly Pollard and Cathy Towler went to
 the Jam Factory. When we went in we   
 saw a cabinet that was full of jams.We
 went into Mr.J.Wilkins office and had 
 a chat. Afterwards he asked us if we  
 would like to look around the factory,
 so we said "Yes." I didn't know how   
 much sugar they used until Kelly      
 asked. They said they used 60 tons of 
 sugar a week and 200,000 a year. Then 
 we went into the cold room. Mr.Wilkin 
 said that there was about 15 degrees  
 of frost. Then we went into the       
 factory. We went past the machine     
 where the jams had been bottled ready 
 to store by 11.15. They would have    
 made 17,480 pots by tonight. It would 
 make 65,000 pots of jam a day. Soon we
 had been all around the factory.
