		<content>   Hayes Secondary pupils visited      
 Hayes Farm. They saw these vegetables:
 lettuce; onions; potatoes; runner     
 beans; cabbages; carrots; broad beans;
 peas; cauliflowers; brussel sprouts.  
   Soft fruits: strawberries;          
 raspberries; blackcurrants;           
 gooseberries; apples; rhubarb.        
   Cereals:barley                      
   The Farm Shop opened in 1962.  Many 
 people come to pick their own fruit.  
 The reservoir in Hayes Farm is about  
 the size of 1 1/2 football pitches. It
 contains 4 million gallons of water.  
 The Farmer built the reservoir because
 he thought that if there was a drought
 he would have enough water for the    
 crops.  The fish in the reservoir are 
 brown and rainbow trout and a pike    
 which is not meant to be there. You   
 can only fish with a permit.
