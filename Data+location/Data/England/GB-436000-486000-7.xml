		<content> The farm also has sheep farming.The   
 farmer has 100 ewes and 180 lambs this
 year (1985).They also have a sheepdog 
 called Moss.                          
   In 1965 they had five men and       
 today,1985,they have three men.The    
 drop in the number of men is due to   
 the use of machinery.                 
   The farm also has 173 acres of      
 land.50% of the land is used for      
 crops.The crops grown are potatoes and
 cereals.                              
   The old farmhouse,built of sandstone
 is not lived in at the moment and the 
 farmer lives across the road in a more
 modern house.                         
   We liked seeing the calves,they were
 tame and licked your hand.We also     
 liked seeing the sheepdog,Moss and a  
 tup(a sheep) that had a lame leg.
