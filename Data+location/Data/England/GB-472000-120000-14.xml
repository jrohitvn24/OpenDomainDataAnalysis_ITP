		<content>{SOUTHERN OUTSKIRTS - THE HEATH:}The   
 Heath is common land and includes a   
 shallow lake of about 22 acres.  The  
 lake is tree lined and with the South 
 Downs in the background it is a       
 popular beauty spot. {Recreation:}40  
 rowing boats and canoes are available 
 for hire in summer.  The lake is      
 patrolled by water balliffs and       
 fishing permits must be obtained. Most
 fishermen are members of the Hants and
 Sussex Alliance Club.  Carp, pike,    
 rudd, bream, tench and roach may be   
 caught.  The council controls the     
 numbers of swans, ducks and geese     
 found on the lake.  A small carpark is
 at the southern end of the lake. {Golf
{Course:}An 18 hole course (par 71 SSS 
 68) runs along the eastern edge of the
 lake. 7 holes are found on the Heath  
 and 11 holes are on the south side of 
 Sussex Road.  Club membership is 450. </content>
