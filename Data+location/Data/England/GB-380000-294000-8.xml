		<title>08ARABLE FARMING NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   This is an area of mixed farming    
with a bias towards arable husbandry,  
including horticulture.   Most of the  
farming is conducted on a family farm  
basis, the individual holdings usually 
being quite substantial.   The land is 
fertile and gives good results if well 
looked after.                          
   Crops include cereals, beet,        
potatoes and other vegetables.   Many  
farms include some intensively managed 
grass, either for hay or silage.       
   Fields are of moderate size, some   
obviously enlarged by the removal of   
hedges, but there are none of the vast 
tracts of land seen in other parts of  
the country and in most cases boundary 
hedges remain, adding to the beauty and
interest of the neighbourhood.         
Different crops are rotated and rarely 
do two adjacent fields carry  the same 
crop.                                  </content>
