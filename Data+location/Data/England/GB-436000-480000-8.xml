		<title>08SANDHUTTON GYMKHANA FAIR</title>
		<content> I WENT TO THE FAIR AT HALF PAST NINE  
 AND HELPED SET OUT THE STALL THAT I   
 WAS HELPING ON.I WAS HELPING ON THE   
 KNOCKING DOWN THE CANS AND THE DART   
 STALL AND ANOTHER BOY WAS HELPING ON  
 SMASHING THE POTS.WE MADE ABOUT Â£12.  
 AT 2 O'CLOCK I WENT TO HELP MY DAD ON 
 THE GYMKANA RING.I WAS HELPING ON THE 
 APPLE AND BUCKET AND A RACE WHERE THE 
 HORSES GO ROUND IN A CIRCLE AND A     
 PERSON IN THE MIDDLE WAVES A FLAG.    
 WHEN HE TURNS IT UPSIDE DOWN THE      
 PEOPLE ON THE HORSES JUMP OFF AND RUN 
 TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AND STAND ON A     
 PIECE OF CARPET.                      
 WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON SOME          
 MEN FROM OUR VILLAGE HAD A TUG OF WAR 
 AGAINST A TEAM FROM THE  ARMY.        
 THE FIRST PULL THE ROPE SNAPPED SO    
 THEY GOT A NEW ROPE AND STARTED AGAIN.
  WE WON!                              
                                       </content>
