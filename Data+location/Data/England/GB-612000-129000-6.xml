		<title>06LAW AND ORDER IN DYMCHURCH</title>
		<content> There are two Policemen in Dymchurch. 
 P.C.Firmen and P.C.Reene are          
 responsible for the area from St.     
 Mary's Bay to the Redoubt. They each  
 have a family house provided in the   
 area. They had to be 18 to join the   
 Police Force. They went to Ashford    
 Training Centre for ten weeks. In     
 Dymchurch they share a silver and     
 white motorbike and a dark blue Ford  
 Escort car. The motorbike is fitted   
 with a radio telephone. Each man has a
 CB radio which has a five mile radius.
 They also have a bleeper. If two      
 P.C.'s are in a car they have to be   
 dressed the same. P.C. Firmen has     
 arrested about 200 people in Dymchurch
 over 6 years. Vandalism is the most   
 common crime in Dymchurch.
