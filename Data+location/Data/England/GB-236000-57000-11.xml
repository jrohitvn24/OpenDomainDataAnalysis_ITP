		<title>11WIVELSCOMBE HOUSE:TREMATON</title>
		<content> Wivelscombe has been in the hands of  
 the present owners since 1967. The    
 estate includes 170 acres of land with
 16 tennants.                          
 Life is difficult for Wivelscombe     
 residents unless they have a car. The 
 owners obtain their goods from        
 Plymouth stores. The telephone        
 connection is not considered adequate 
 and the only other transport is       
 provided by an infrequent train       
 service, with a journey of about half 
 an hour to the station.               
 The house is surrounded by a well kept
 garden, pride of the present owners,  
 and features an interesting Pinnacle. 
 This was rescued from Westminster     
 Abbey by a friend during renovation   
 work designed to replace the decayed  
 and polluted Portland Stone monuments.
 Apart from the garden, one other hobby
 of the owners is photography.         </content>
