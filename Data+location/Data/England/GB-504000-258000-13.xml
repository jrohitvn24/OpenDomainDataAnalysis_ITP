		<content> There is both a Baptist and Anglican  
 Church in Thurleigh. The Baptist      
 Chapel in Thurleigh shares it's pastor
 with Keysoe and the vicar of St.      
 Peters is also the vicar for Milton   
 Ernest. The 2 churches have over      
 recent years built up very close links
 with each other. Once a month worship 
 for the two congregations is united.  
 The Baptist lay pastor and the vicar  
 both take the service which alternates
 it's location between the Baptist     
 Chapel and St. Peters Church. The     
 congrgation also join for a crib      
 service at Christmas and for a service
 on Good Friday at Easter.
