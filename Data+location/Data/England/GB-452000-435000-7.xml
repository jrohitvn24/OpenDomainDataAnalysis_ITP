		<content> Although it may not seem at first that
 in such an agricultural area there    
 could be much opportunity for         
 business, nonetheless there are a     
 number of small businesses in the part
 of Church Fenton in this block.       
 Whilstthese could not all be described
 as thriving, in that there is no      
 expansion planned, most of them make a
 reasonable living. Those that do      
 better, attract business from a wide  
 area eg. Leeds, Selby and north. Such 
 business usually coming by word of    
 mouth rather than advertising. Other  
 firms exist to serve the local        
 community by offering personal service
 which could not be obtained from      
 larger concerns. These probably could 
 not survive if their owners were      
 dependent upon this alone for their   
 livelihoods.
