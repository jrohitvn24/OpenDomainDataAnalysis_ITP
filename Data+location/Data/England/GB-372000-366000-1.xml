		<title>01AN INTRODUCTION TO CRANAGE</title>
		<content>    Cranage has always been an         
 important area for travellers and is  
 mentioned in the original Domesday    
 Book as a stopping place for rest and 
 refreshment. Now the A54 to Buxton in 
 the east and Chester in the west, and 
 the A50 to the north and south run    
 through the block.                    
    More important now is the M6 which 
 divides the block into east and west. 
 It has provided a major link with the 
 north and south and there is a major  
 junction with the A54 at Junction 18  
 (almost in the centre of the block).  
    There is a very low population due 
 to the extent of farmland covering the
 area. Most housing is located at the  
 easterly side near to Holmes Chapel.  
 Here the land rises slightly away from
 the River Dane. The river divides the 
 area into north and south.
