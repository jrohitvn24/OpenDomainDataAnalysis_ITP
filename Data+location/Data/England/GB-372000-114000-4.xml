		<content> The only line of communication is Wat-
 erloo Lane,now surfaced,which joins   
 the A357 Stalbridge-Sturminster road. 
 Caundle Brook flows WtoE in the south.
 100 breeding ewes are on the enclosed 
 rough grazing meadows;the better grass
 -lands northwards being used for dairy
 and beef herds.New ventures;an acre of
 vines produces 1400 bottles white wine
 annually;3 man-made ponds provide pond
 weed retailed countrywide.            
 There are neither retired people nor  
 children here.A private bus service   
 runs Shillingstone-Yeovil. All        
 households have a car.Some work       
 locally,others commute outside as     
 teachers or secretaries.              
 The area is well-farmed,tidy and all  
 the fields are used for good returns. 
 Some folk are reluctant to talk of    
 their farms or their work but they are
 happy with their way of life.         </content>
