		<content> In summer a typical outfit for an     
 English girl would be a light dress,  
 skirt or pair of shorts,with a T-shirt
 &amp; ankle socks. She would wear summer  
 shoes like sandals or maybe some flat 
 shoes with a V-shape that you put your
 big toe in. Perhaps even shoes called 
 'jelly beans' because they are made of
 brightly coloured plastic woven in    
 patterns to make a shoe. You can get a
 bag in the same pattern. Boys would   
 wear cotton trousers or shorts,a      
 T-shirt &amp; trainers. In winter a girl  
 would wear jeans &amp; a sweat shirt,or a 
 skirt with thick tights or long socks 
 &amp; ankle boots. She would have to wear 
 a coat or jacket to go out. A boy     
 would wear jeans or thick trousers    
 like cords (made of corduroy) &amp; a     
 sweat shirt or jumper. They might wear
 a shirt &amp; tie if they wanted to look  
 smart.                                </content>
