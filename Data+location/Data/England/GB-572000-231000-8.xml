		<content> The base was built in 1941 and        
 finished in 1944 although fighter     
 planes took off before it was         
 completed. During 1946 it was         
 abandoned and the hangars and         
 buildings were used for a circus to   
 put animals in. In 1951 it was        
 restored to working order and only    
 had fighter planes. Now there         
 are no military aircraft.
