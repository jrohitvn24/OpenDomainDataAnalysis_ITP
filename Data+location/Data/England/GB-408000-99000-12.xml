		<title>12RECREATION SCRAMBLING SPORTS</title>
		<content> My hobby is{scrambling.}Sometimes we  
 go to Corfe Mullen on Charlie Weldon's
 farm. My brother still rides but we   
 sold my bike some time ago. Many of my
 family go in for trials (riding       
 over an obstacle course and being     
 timed) and scrambling (racing round   
 a track). We help set up the track    
 before the race. The bikes have to be 
 checked to see which classes they     
 should be in. There are three groups  
 of riders - senior, junior, and       
 children under 9. My brother and I are
 in the junior group. My Dad has won   
 many trials' trophies.                
 In our school we are very lucky to    
 have two large{gyms}and we have a     
 large field of about 6 hectares.  For 
{games}lessons we wear a special kit - 
 shorts, T-shirt, socks and trainers.  
 We have a sports day when we compete  
 to find the best child in each sport. </content>
