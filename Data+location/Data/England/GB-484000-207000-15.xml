		<title>15Wendover Garden Centre</title>
		<content>World's End Garden Centre is a rapidly 
expanding family business. The Bone    
Brothers, former market stall holders  
became owners in 1970. Trade expanded  
and now sixteen building have been     
erected on the 7 acre site. The family 
employs a full-time staff of 30 and 15 
part-time helpers, making the centre   
the largest employer in Wendover.      
 Most produce comes from Nine Elms     
but bulbs and flowers are often        
obtained from other countries. The     
popularity of the centre is evident    
from the consistently busy car park,   
currently being extended and the queues
of customers.                          
 The owners recognise the need to      
provide family appeal and the site     
includes a pet shop, a coffee shop,    
garden furniture and barbeque          
department, general garden &amp; home      
requirements.                          </content>
