It was Sunday. At last my alarm went   
off at 8.00. I crept slowly down the   
stairs, I got my Weetabix and some     
toast, then I went back upstairs to    
get dressed. At 9.25 I left my house   
to catch the coach to Sudbury, Shaun   
and I sat at the back. We got to       
Sudbury.Then we had to find the        
football pitch. This was not easy but  
luckily for us we saw the Spartans'    
manager and he directed us. We got     
the game started and we were winning,  
when I got the ball, I hit it with my  
right foot from 25 yards right into    
the top of the net. At half time the   
score was 10 goals to us and nil to the
other team. In the second half I got 2 
more goals to complete my hat trick    
and put the final total to 23. Then,   
we went home I went to bed.
