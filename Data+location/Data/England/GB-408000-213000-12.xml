		<content>   In 1974 the first Northleach steam  
 fair was held opposite the old mill. A
 woman came from Birmingham to sell    
 goods. Somebody told her that nobody  
 lived in ______ cottage for years. She
 was surprised to see an old man with  
 a deformed arm in the back garden.    
 Locals were asked if they knew anyone 
 like that. They said "You must mean   
 old _______, but he's been dead for 25
 years _he used to live in the old     
 cottage!" The same year a man was     
 going along the A40 road  in his car, 
 when he saw a hippy thumbing a lift.  
 He didn't stop for him, but for some  
 strange reason the hippy walked out in
 front of his car. The man in the car  
 felt no impact and when he went to to 
 see if he was dead, there was no trace
 of the hippy.
