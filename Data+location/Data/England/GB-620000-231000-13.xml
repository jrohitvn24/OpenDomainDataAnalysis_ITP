		<title>13COPPERAS WOOD - TREES</title>
		<content> There are{twenty five species}of tree 
 in the wood.Apart from the sweet      
 chestnut there are:-                  
 Scots Pine: Blackthorn: Lime: Oak:    
 Elderberry: Hornbeam: Hazel: Mapel:   
 Horse Chestnut: Holly: Sycamore:      
 Hawthorn: Spindle: Small Leaf Lime:   
 Ash: Dogwood: Elm.                    
 The{Essex Naturalist Trust}are        
 beginning to manage the wood again,   
{coppicing}it as it was for hundreds of
 years. In a 15 year cycle areas of the
 wood are cut for the timber, which is 
 sold. The natural vegetation is,      
 for the first time for generations,   
 then allowed to grow. First the wild  
 flowers appear, like the Red Campion, 
 followed by nettles as the trees begin
 to grow again. Finally brambles       
 become established before they give   
 way to the trees which block out the  
 light.These are then cut again.       </content>
