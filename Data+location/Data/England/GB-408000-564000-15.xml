{SWINDALE COTTAGES                     
  The cottages are situated near The   
 Dene in a crescent with an attractive 
 surrounding. Severe winter weather    
 delayed the completion of the cottages
 but the old-folk were able to move in 
 to the cottages at the end of March   
 1981                                  
  On Friday the 7th May 1981 the       
 cottages were officialy named after   
 the late Dr. Swindale who worked well 
 and was liked very much in Wylam. The 
 cottages were opened by members of the
 late doctor's family, Edward and Mary.</content>
