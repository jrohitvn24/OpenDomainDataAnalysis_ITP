     The wildlife consists of          
 squirrels, rooks, ducks, moorhens,    
 garden birds, insects and pond        
 life. Weedkillers such as 245T and    
 farmers burning stubble are a threat  
 to the garden and its wildlife.       
     The visitors come all the year    
 round and even when there is snow on  
 the ground  there is at least one     
 visitor in the garden. There are      
 about 80,000 visitors per year. The   
 80,000 includes O.A.P.'s, members of  
 the W.I., School parties and, of      
 course, the general public. The  most 
 popular time of the year for visiting 
 are, May to June, Whitsuntide, the    
 autumn and July.                      
     Ness Gardens are the only         
 botanic gardens in the country to     
 have a visitor's centre to cater for  
 coach parties etc. on wet days.       </content>
