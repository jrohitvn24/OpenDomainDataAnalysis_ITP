    Each year about the end of June    
Trysull holds a summer fete. There are 
stalls as in a market,sports events,   
dancing and games.                     
    This year the theme was Medieaval. 
There were men dressed as knights in   
armour who took part in a mock joust,  
chldren danced round the maypole and   
played games of the period.            
   The organisers had tried to find out
many customs of the times.
