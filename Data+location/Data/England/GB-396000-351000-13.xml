		<content>   Cheddleton has a thriving farming   
 community, mainly dairy. Recently the 
 E.E.C. quota system has caused concern

 reduce their stock. The stop-go method
 recently by the M. of Agriculture,    
 Fisheries of food, when farmers were  
 ecouraged to sell off milk-yeilding   
 animals and purchase beef, only to be 
 persuaded to go back onto milk        
 production, and now their quota has   
 been reduced.                         
   Most farmers in the area use silage 
 and when the weather has been as wet  
 as this summer has, it is the only way
 to get winter fodder satifactorilly. A
 few farmers grow oats and barley,     
 mainly for their own use, and a few   
 grow tomatoes. There are two garden   
 centres catering mainly for the       
 domestic market.
