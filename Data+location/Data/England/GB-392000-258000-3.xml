		<content>      The intensive systems of farming 
 in this area are mainly Dairying and  
 Cereals , together with some poultry  
 production - this being Turkeys for   
 the Christmas trade.                  
      The cereals grown are on the     
 whole winter varieties , i.e. those   
 planted in September and October for  
 harvesting the following year. The    
 princepal types being Wheat and Barley
 with some Oats , Beans and Rape.      
      The reason for the choice of     
 winter corn is mainly the clay soil   
 which retains nutrients and moisture. 
 This allows for greater yealds of     
 grain - up to 3.5 tonnes per acre for 
 both Wheat and Barley. The Wheat is   
 either used for milling into flour or 
 for cattle feed. The Barley is mostly 
 used for cattle feed.
