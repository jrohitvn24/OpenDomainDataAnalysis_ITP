		<content> My house is 22 years old.  It is      
 semi-detached and is make from bricks 
 and wood.  My room is the smallest    
 room in the house.  I have got a cork 
 board on my wall for all my notes.    
 I have a blue carpet.  There are 2    
 other bedrooms - my sister's and my   
 mum and dad's.  In the kitchen there  
 is a cooker, washing machine, freezer,
 fridge, tumble-dryer, sink and        
 cupboards.  The garden has 2 bird     
 aviaries, flowers and trees.  It is   
 about 12.5m by 6m.                    
                                       
 In a survey we found that most people 
 lived in semi-detached houses.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
