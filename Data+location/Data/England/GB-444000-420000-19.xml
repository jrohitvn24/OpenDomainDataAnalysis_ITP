		<title>19Carlton Park Estate.</title>
		<content> Carleton Park started as rough land   
 gradually sloping downhill.By 1957 the
 land had been cleared and roads had   
 been built.It was left for 2 years    
 until 1959 when the first houses were 
 lived in .They were sold as private   
 homes .One of the first streets was   
 Baden Powell Cresent.                 
  Gradually more and more streets were 
 built. The estate was being developed 
 quickly .It was being built gradually 
 down the hill.In 1965 a Co-op grocery 
 shop opened at the end of Pease       
 Close,over the road.Then for business 
 reasons.Pease Close was also built by 
 the Council and sold as private       
 homes.Pease Close was ready by 1961.  
  After Pease Close the houses in      
 Robson Close and downwards are Council
 houses unless they have been bought   
 back as private homes as a few have.
