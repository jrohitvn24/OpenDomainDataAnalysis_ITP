		<content> In our survey of the area we were able
 to collect information that was based 
 on people's preferences,if they had   
 any.The most popular pastime was      
 football.Over a quarter of the sample 
 chose this example.The next most      
 popular was watching                  
 television.Approximately an eighth put
 this as their favourite.Swimming and  
 bike riding came next.These were      
 followed by running,drawing,and       
 snooker,all of which took about three 
 percent of the total                  
 number.Pets,squash,rollerskating,crick
 et,dancing,horse riding,and rounders  
 ,took very small interest over our    
 sample.
