		<title>03THE METRO COMES TO TYNEMOUTH</title>
		<content> Tynemouth has had a succession of     
 railway stations over the last 100    
 years but the increasing numbers of   
 private cars has led to a steady      
 decline in traffic since the mid      
 1950's. Trains were becoming obsolete.
                                       
 Tyne and Wear County Council devised a
 completely new policy for public      
 transport which would enable the      
 population to travel anywhere in the  
 County by either bus or the new Metro.
                                       
 The Metro is a rapid transit system   
 operated by lightweight trams running 
 for much of their distance along the  
 old railway lines. The system is      
 powered by electricity and is a fast  
 and popular way to travel.
