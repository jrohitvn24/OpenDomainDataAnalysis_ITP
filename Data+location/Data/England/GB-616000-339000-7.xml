		<title>07FARMING AROUND AYLMERTON</title>
		<content>  Farming in the area can be described 
 as{arable with livestock. }Outwardly, 
 the impression is one of arable, as   
 most of the farmland is cropped, the  
 main exception being Felbrigg Park.   
  The main arable crops are{wheat,     
{barley}and{sugar-beet,}with a range of
 other crops, including lettuces, grown
 occasionally.                         
  Closer inspection of the farms shows 
 that considerable numbers of livestock
 are also kept.  Hall Farm, Felbrigg,  
 grazes{beef cattle}on the parkland at 
 Felbrigg Hall, and Park Wall Farm also
 has cattle.  Several farms, including 
 Church Farm and Laurel Farm, keep{pigs
 and other livestock in the farm       
 buildings.                            
  The crops grown can be used for{pig  
 or{cattle food}- for example, kale and
 barley.  Sugar-beet tops are also     
 used, and beet pulp from the factory. </content>
