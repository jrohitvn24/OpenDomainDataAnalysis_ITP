 This area is the north west part of   
 the Lizard peninsula. Most of the area
 is undulating open farmland with      
 patches of trees in the small         
 valleys.To the east there is the Royal
 Naval Air Station of Culdrose,the     
 largest helicoptor base in Europe.To  
 the north there is the southern part  
 of the ancient town of Helston,the    
 older streets  surrounded by newer    
 housing estates.These estates were    
 built for families of Culdrose        
 personnel.                            
     Southwest of Helston is Loe       
 Pool,Cornwalls biggest natural        
 freshwater lake,a place of great      
 beauty and legend. This is a densely  
 wooded area with Degibna Woods to the 
 east of the pool and Penrose Estate on
 the west bank.This is a superb place  
 for walks and picnics.                </content>
