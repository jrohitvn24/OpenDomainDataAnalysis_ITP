		<title>07BIOGRAPHY OF SIR R ARKWRIGHT</title>
		<content>                                       
Captain Arkwright, the inventor of the 
Spinning Jenny has descendents living  
at Hatton House in Hatton Village.     
Two of the Arkwright family were killed
in the 2nd World War and the next      
generation is still living in Hatton.  
Sir Richard Arkwright was born in      
1732. In 1764 he started work on a     
water driven frame for spinning which  
introduced power machinery to the      
textile industry.  The machinery       
produced a strong thread, strong enough
to be used as a warp, or lengthwise    
thread for machine-operated looms. In  
1768 he had finished the machine which 
he called the 'Spinning Jenny'.The     
machine was not patented until the     
following year. He then opened textile 
factories in Nottingham.               
In 1792 he died in Hatton where he     
had lived all his life.                </content>
