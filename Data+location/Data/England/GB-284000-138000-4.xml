		<title>04The River Exe,Exford</title>
		<content> The river Exe rises at Exehead,high on
 the moors. It is just a little boggy  
 area, very swampy with cotton grass   
 growing around. It runs through Exford
 and past the school. The water for the
 village is pumped up to a tank, from  
 the river and purified.Towards Court  
 Bridge you can see the sewage works.  
 There are lots of birds such as       
 dippers,mallards,heron and the odd    
 kingfisher.Many people enjoy the trout
 fishing. After Exford it flows through
 Winsford,Tiverton  and Exeter.The     
 river Barle joins it at Exbridge It   
 has become a wide river by  the time  
 it has reached the sea at Exmouth.
