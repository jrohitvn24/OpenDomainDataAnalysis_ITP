		<title>11IRONBRIDGE POWER STATION</title>
		<content>   The old Ironbridge Power Station    
 was built in the 1920s and pulled     
 down one year ago.                    
    The present Ironbridge Power       
 Station was built in 1968. It took    
 8_10 years to build with 1 thousand   
 men working on it. The Power Station  
 is built on a 212 acre site. The      
 Power Station itself occupies 110     
 acres of the site. There are four     
 cooling towers at the Power Station   
 each 88 metres wide and 114 metres    
 high. The stack at the Ironbridge     
 Power Station is one of the highest   
 in Europe.                            
   The Power Station generates 25,000  
 volts. It is then transformed into    
 400,000 volts, each house only has 240
 volts. 70,000 tons of coal go to the  
 Power Station a week.
