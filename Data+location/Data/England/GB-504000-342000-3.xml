{Willoughby}and{Quarrington}from       
 l957 to his retirement in l984. He was

 three areas, people, paper, and       
 prayer.                               
 He visited people in their own homes  
 and in hospital, especially{Rauceby   
{Hospital,}which was situated within   
 his pastoral district. He produced the
 parish magazine. He  had to deal with 
 many letters, papers and matters of   
 finance. In connection with fund      
 raising a{summer fete}was held and a  
 stall was rented in{Sleaford Market   
{Place}just before Christmas for the   
 sale of goods donated by parishioners.
 Much of his time was spent in private 
 and public prayer.                    </content>
