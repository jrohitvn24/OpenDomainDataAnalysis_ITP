		<content> WHEN IT WAS DECIDED TO UNITE ASTON AND
 WESTON ECCLESIASTICALLY THE           
 CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SCHOOL COULD NOT 
 HAVE BEEN FORESEEN. THE LARGER        
 PARISH,ASTON,HOUSES THE RECTOR (WHO IS
 CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNORS AT WESTON   
 SCHOOL) AND HIS FAMILY AND IN         
 RECENT YEARS MASSIVE HOUSING          
 DEVELOPMENTS IN ASTON HAVE CREATED    
 AN IMBALANCE IN POPULATION.NO MORE    
 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS ENVISAGED IN   
 WESTON.CHELLASTON TOO HAS             
 MUSHROOMED,BEING THE VILLAGE/SUBURB   
 WHERE THE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL IS     
 SITUATED.DERBY IS ENCROACHING ON GREEN
 FIELDS AT ALVASTON; PARENTS MOBILITY  
 AND PARENTAL CHOICE ENCOURAGES        
 (RIGHTLY!)MOVEMENT BETWEEN SCHOOLS    
 REQUIRING AN EXAMINATION OF CURRICULAE
 FALLING ROLLS HAS HEIGHTENED          
 COMPETITION BETWEEN SCHOOLS, AFFECTING
 HOUSE PRICES.WILL WESTON SCH.SURVIVE? </content>
