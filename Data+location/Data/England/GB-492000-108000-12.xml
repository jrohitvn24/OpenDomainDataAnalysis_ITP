		<title>12The Forestry Commission.</title>
		<content> Within the area the Forestry          
 Commission follows a fairly strict    
 routine of conservation over the large
 areas of woodland. The trees within   
 the area are a mixture of hard and    
 soft woods, but are mainly beech,oak, 
 ash and some pine. Most of the        
 plantations are open to the public,   
 with car parks and picnic areas to    
 encourage people to use the forests.  
 They also ensure that the game,such as
 deer, is protected,so dogs on leads   
 are allowed,but are not encouraged to 
 run free. They also protect all       
 wildlife and ensure that pheasants are
 not interferred with and that poachers
 are actively discouraged!             
 They work in close cooperation with   
 the local farmers,so that trees on    
 farm land are equally conserved with  
 those on the plantations.
