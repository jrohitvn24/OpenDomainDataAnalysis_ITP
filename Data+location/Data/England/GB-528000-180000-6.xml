		<content> This year is the year of the Tiger.   
 When it is Chinese New Year we have a 
 celebration in China town. There is   
 always a dragon dance.  There will be 
 two men holding the dragon.  One man  
 will be holding the head of the dragon
 and the other man will hold the tail. 
 Whey they are ready there will be some
 men drumming the drums and the dragon 
 will start to dance.  The dragon goes 
 to every restaurant and the restaurant
 people hand some money and lettuce up 
 high and then the dragon has to try to
 get it.  So when the dragon gets the  
 money and the lettuce he has to       
 pretend to eat the lettuce.  When they
 have done it the dragon will go to    
 another restaurant to do it again and 
 they will get a lot of money and this 
 is how you say 'Happy New Year' in    
 Chinese. (Gong hay Fat Choi)
