		<title>19Springfield Gravel Pit</title>
		<content>   The development of the Springfield  
gravel pit is a major issue concerning 
Beaconsfield residents today. Despite  
public protest the plans were finally  
passed 6 years ago and digging started 
4 years later. The site being          
excavated at this moment will be used  
for a gravel plant. The plans state    
that this must be erected 40 feet below
ground level so as not to affect the   
landscape to a large degree. The       
extraction will destroy 4 surrounding  
fields, producing sand and gravel      
for 20 years, after which time the pit 
will be filled with  rubbish and       
eventually restored to farmland. The   
controversy surrounding the pit        
concerns not only the effect of heavy  
lorries through Beaconfield and the    
dumping of rubbish but also the        
possible leakage of methane gas from   
decaying organic matter after infill.  </content>
