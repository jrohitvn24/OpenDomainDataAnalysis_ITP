		<title>14BAND OF HOPE DEMONSTRATION</title>
		<content> The{Band of Hope}is an organization to
 try and stop people drinking alcohol. 
 The{113th Demonstration }was held in  
 Appleby on the 15th of June 1985.It   
 used to be held in Kirkby Stephen.    
 The demonstration consists of a       
 procession,awards,speeches,football,sp
 orts and a fair.                      
 First I carried the Nateby and Wharton
{banner}in the procession with my      
 friend Ben.Earlier in the year we did 
 some{Temperance Knowledge exams.}We   
 had to know what damage alcohol does  
 to the human body.I was awarded 40p   
 and a certificate of merit by the new 
{Band of Hope Queen }kathryn Hastwell  
 she made a speech about alcohol       
 causing violence at football matches  
 like at the Europeon cup final in     
 Brussels this year, and car accidents.
 Then we played football.My team came  
 runners up in the final.              </content>
