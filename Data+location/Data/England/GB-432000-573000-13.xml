		<title>13 ST. MARYS LIGHTHOUSE</title>
		<content>St Mary's lighthouse was the           
predecessor of the lighthouse on Priory
Point in Tynemouth.Mr J.L.Miller       
started building the lighthouse on St. 
Mary's Island in 1896.Up until then    
there had been 6 major shipwrecks.It   
took nearly 3/4 million bricks         
,eight thousand pounds and two years   
hard work.It is 110 ft. tall and has   
137 steps.While they were building it  
they found stone coffins.They were the 
remains of people that had been        
shipwrecked or drowned due to the      
treacherous rocks surrounding the      
island.It wasn't until 1978 that the   
lighthouse was modernized to           
electricity.The light can be seen for  
17 miles.On the 27th of November in    
1984 the lighthouse was made           
redundant.The local council were       
appealing for donations to save the    
lighthouse.                            </content>
