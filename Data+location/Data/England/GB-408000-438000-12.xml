		<title>12The Five Rise Locks, Bingley</title>
		<content> The Five Rise Locks on the            
 Leeds-Liverpool Canal were designed by
 John Longbotham and opened in 1774.   
 They have changed very little since   
 they were built by four local         
 stonemasons. The locks are built in   
 "staircase" formation and raise the   
 canal 60ft. It takes about 30mins to  
 pass through them in narrow boats.    
 The canal is used today mainly by     
 pleasure boats and as many as thirty  
 boats may pass through the locks in a 
 day. Two large pleasure boats operate 
 regularly. Apollo, a traditional      
 narrow boat carries up to 48 people   
 and the Water Prince 78. Both boats   
 can be hired for private parties.     
 The Local Council run a 'water-bus'   
 service during the summer months      
 between Shipley and Bingley with      
 several bus-stops along the route.
