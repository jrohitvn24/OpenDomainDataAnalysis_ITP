		<title>18Frenchay Hospital</title>
		<content>{Frenchay Hospital}was opened in 1931  
 for the care of tuberculous children. 
 It consisted of a large mansion  in 70
 acres of land and housed 100 beds and 
 a school for 30 children.  During the 
 2nd World War it was staffed by       
 American troops and many single-storey
 buildings were erected. These are     
 still in use. In 1948 the NHS         
 reorganised Britain's hospitals  and  
 Frenchay began its specialised areas  
 of surgery:Thoracic, Neuro and        
 Plastic.  Since then the hospital has 
 expanded to become a large general    
 hospital including a major accident   
 unit.  It still has a school for its  
 young patients.                       
   The Hospital has 546 beds and       
 employs 2000 staff to care for 15000  
 In-patients, 70000 Out-patients and   
 10000 Day patients annually.
