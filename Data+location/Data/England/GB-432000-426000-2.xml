		<title>02A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SCOTT</title>
		<content> On saturday I usually get up about    
 eight. I watch television then play   
 with my friends on my B.M.X push bike.
 We ride down to a B.M.X track we do   
 jumps. I go back home about two to go 
 to the supermarket. We buy food, toys 
 and drink. When we get back I have my 
 dinner then play out with my football.
 at six o'clock I have my tea I usually
 have meat chips and vegetables. After 
 tea I play on my B.M.X again we ride  
 around the B.M.X track. I go home at  
 half past nine I watch the television 
 programmes then I go to my bedroom to 
 play records. At about half past      
 eleven I brush my teeth and get into  
 bed. Then later I go to sleep.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
