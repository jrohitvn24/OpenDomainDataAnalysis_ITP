		<title>06A TRADITIONAL BAKERY</title>
		<content>    There is a local bakery situated at
 Bathway crossroads on the southern    
 edge of Chewton Mendip. It is a       
 traditional family business employing 
 three members of the family and one   
 other.                                
    The bakery itself has one huge old 
 oven with two main sections . A       
 variety of breads and cakes are made, 
 including many wholemeal types. The   
 bakery also specialises in wedding    
 cakes as well as traditional          
 specialities like harvest loaves.     
    The bread is sold in the Post      
 Office Stores which is also run by the
 family. The bread is also deliverd to 
 many homes, pubs, restaurants and     
 hotels in the surrounding villages and
 hamlets. Traditionally home baked     
 bread is obviously still very popular.
