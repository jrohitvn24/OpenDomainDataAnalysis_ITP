		<title>13Interview with Mrs. Sutton</title>
		<content>    We asked Mrs. Sutton to talk to us 
 because when she first married in 1950
 she lived in a house which stood where
 the school's newest classroom is now. 
    She told us that the house had been
 built when the school was built and   
 had been made in the same way in that 
 it looked like part of the school and 
 even had lattice windows like the     
 school. It was built for the Head     
 teacher but the last one lived there  
 in 1938.                              
    When Mrs. Sutton lived there there 
 was no electricity or mains water or  
 drainage. They used oil lamps and     
 fetched the water from the well in the
 Vicararge garden. Cooking was done on 
 a range which had to be polished with 
 black lead and the scullery floor was 
 red brick.                            
    She told us about shortages after  
 the War and showed us some photos.    </content>
