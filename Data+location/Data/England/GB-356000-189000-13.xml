		<title>13Housing in Littleton</title>
		<content> Littleton-on-Severn is a sleepy little
 village. The buildings are a mixture  
 of the old and new. As you enter the  
 village from Aust you come across an  
 old school building which is no longer
 in use. There are many fine old       
 detatched houses, a number of which   
 have been renovated and modernised.   
 As we walked up a lane we came to duck
 pond and in front of us there was a   
 very imposing building which looked   
 like an old mansion house. Some of the
 houses have thatched roofs but        
 there are also some much newer        
 buildings-bungalows and semi-detatched
 houses. There are also some farm      
 houses in the centre and on the       
 outskirts of the village.
