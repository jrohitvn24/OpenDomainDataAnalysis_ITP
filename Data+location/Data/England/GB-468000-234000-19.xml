		<content> Buckingham's housing has increased by 
 about 50% in the last decade,whilst   
 the population has risen by 46% to    
 6627 (1981 census figures). There are 
 ten new housing estates in the area. A
 new semi-detached house costs about   
 35 000. Ten years ago this price was 
 12 000.                              
       {                               
{       BUCKINGHAM HOSPITAL.           
 The hospital is due to be enlarged-it 
 will soon be provided with another    
 ward and better toilet facilities.    
 About 16 patients are admitted every  
 week. The latest funds raised by the  
 League of Friends have been used to   
 provide a pay-phone.
