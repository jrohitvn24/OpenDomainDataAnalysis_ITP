   Whilst Flockton Parish church is not
 important architectually, it has one  
 important feature, the William Morris 
 Window. People interested in stained  
 glass and/or in William Morris have   
 found the Parish church to be worth a 
 visit.                                
   Netherton Hall is a fine eighreenth 
 century stucture and is probably the  
 third hall on the present site.       
 Although now divided into three       
 residences there are a number of      
 interesting features including an oak 
 panelled room with a reputedly Adam   
 fireplace, wooden ledges for storing  
 wines and beer in the cellars, and a  
 room at the bottom of the cellar steps
 for imprisoning poachers. There was a 
 secret tunnel and the house reputedly 
 has a ghost, a lady in a grey dress.
