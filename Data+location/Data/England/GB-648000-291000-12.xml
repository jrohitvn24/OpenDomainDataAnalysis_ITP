People who live in Oulton Broad like   
living there because there are play    
parks for young and old children and   
lots of pubs and hotels.Some people    
would like more entertainment in pubs. 
Sports facilities are not good for     
teenagers.There are not many churches  
in Oulton Broad.People are happy       
with the number of shops in the area.  
Some do not like road safety but they  
like the tidiness and health services.
