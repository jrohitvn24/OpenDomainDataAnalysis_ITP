		<title>16Linnel Mill by Alison Lambie</title>
		<content> We went to the Linnels on Tuesday.It  
 is a beautiful old house with a lovely
 big garden.Mr.Charlton told  us about 
 the house when we went in.The old mill
 worked on water from the mill race,   
 from the dam across Devil's           
 Water.First the Linnels was a cottage 
 then it was a pub.There was a battle  
 of Hexham on Mr.Charlton's land,      
 between Lancaster and York.Queen      
 Margaret had to escape with her little
 son and she met up with a robber who  
 helped her.The mill was for the       
 farmers round about to grind their    
 corn into meal.The mill is very old   
 and very dark.We don't know when the  
 mill was built but the house was built
 in the 1800s.The house was the first  
 in this area to have electricty from  
 the turbo generator in the mill.Linnel
 Bridge is a lovely old narrow bridge  
 built in 1531 in reign of Q.Eliz.1.   </content>
