		<title>12Making Cement</title>
		<content>Chinnor Cement Works makes 6 varieties 
ofcement for building and making       
concrete. The work is hard but,with    
modern technology,less so than in the  
days.The cement is made from calcium   
carbonate (chalk) quarried from the    
Chiltern escarpment.It is converted    
into cement by a kilning process.      
It is distributed either in a dry,     
bagged form or bulk by a fleet of 11   
flat-backed and 16 cylinder lorries;   
each carrying either 15 or 20 tonnes.  
The Cement Works is operative for 24   
hours a day and is one of six works    
owned by Rugby Portland Cement plc.,   
distributed throughout the central and 
eastern part of England.               
About 20 years ago extensive drilling  
trials were carried out at Chinnor in  
connection with the proposed Channel   
Tunnel,because of the similarity       
betweenthe chalk here and at Dover.    </content>
