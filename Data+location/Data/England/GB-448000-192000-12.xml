		<title>12Fishing The Thames.</title>
		<content>    The Thames is a good river to fish 
 in some parts of the county. I fish at
 Sutton pools, the upper and lower     
 moors (Culham) and Culham lock cut.   
    The main fish caught here are      
 bream, chub, perch, pike, roach, dace,
 bleak, gudgeon, daddy ruff and barbel.
    Along the lower moors the best     
 catches are barbel. These fish range  
 from 2 lb to 12 lb but are difficult  
 to catch. It is best to use swimfeeded
 luncheon meat as bait. (Swimfeeding   
 means using a special bait which is   
 not on the hook itself.)              
    On the upper moors it is best to   
 use a swimfeed to catch the most fish.
 Many small fish are also caught here. 
    You can not fish some of the lock  
 cut until later in the year. It is    
 best to fish this area on leger,      
 swimfeeder or float. A roach pole is  
 also useful depending on the current. </content>
