		<title>04Ad Astra First School.</title>
		<content> We visited Ad Astra and talked to the 
 children to see what they thought of  
 their school.We asked them questions  
 on sport,lessons,uniform and teachers.
 We also asked them what subjects they 
 liked.We found that the most popular  
 was Maths and the least English.They  
 call it Writing or Language.They all  
 enjoyed their lessons,and liked their 
 teachers.They liked wearing school    
 uniform because it was sensible.They  
 also said that they liked it being    
 yellow,grey and white.We asked them   
 whether they thought that girls should
 be allowed to wear trousers and they  
 all said NO.They liked their school so
 much that they didn't really want to  
 move up to Middle School.They all     
 enjoyed running and rounders but they 
 don't play football.Their school has  
 347 pupils.                           
                                       </content>
