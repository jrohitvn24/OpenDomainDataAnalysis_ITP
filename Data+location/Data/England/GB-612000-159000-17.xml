		<content>The Reserve area of 440 acres is part  
of the large forest that once          
surrounded Canterbury which extends to 
9000 acres. The Reserve is in a block  
of 2000 acres North of Canterbury. One 
third is old woodland of native tree   
- species..                            
. New conifer plantations the remaining
two thirds. The Reserve is open to     
anyone, families, birdwatchers,        
walkers and nature lovers. There are   
about 90 species of woodland bird      
including tits woodpeckers redstart    
wood warblers and nightingales, 30 of  
them breeding here. A rare butterfly,
