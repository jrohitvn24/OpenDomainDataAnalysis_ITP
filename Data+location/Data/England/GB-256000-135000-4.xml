		<title>04CHURCH AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Shirwell Church is a thirteenth       
 century Norman Church.  It has an     
 average congregation of only fifteen. 
 There are six bells which are rung for
 ten minutes before each service and   
 there is a bell ringing group who     
 practice regularly.  There are two    
 Churchwardens who look after the      
 church and keep it in order.          
   Also in Shirwell is a Methodist     
 Chapel.  A few more people go to      
 Chapel than to the Church of England  
 service and a Sunday School is        
 provided there for the young members  
 of the community.                     
   At present, there is no resident    
 vicar in Shirwell and the visiting    
 vicar who serves the Church will      
 retire shortly after which it is      
 planned that vicars from other        
 parishes will take it in turns to come
 to Shirwell on a Sunday.              </content>
