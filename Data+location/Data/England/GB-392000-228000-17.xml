		<title>17Hardy Rd. area. Our survey.</title>
		<content>      Most of the older men interviewed
 belonged to local clubs and societies 
 such as the cricket club. Many of the 
 elderly women belong to the           
 St.Michael's Church society.          
      It is rather sad to find that    
 many of the elderly are lonely. There 
 are a number of widowed people who    
 live apart from their families.       
 Although very independent, some       
 elderly residents were nervous about  
 going out alone, particuarly at night.
 There were few complaints about this  
 area as a place to live and almost    
 everyone agreed that they generally   
 enjoyed living here.
