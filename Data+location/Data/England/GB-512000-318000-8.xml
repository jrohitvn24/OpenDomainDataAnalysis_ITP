		<content>    In an area almost{devoid of human }
{habitation}wildlife in every form     
 abounds, from the road-side{flowers}to
 the{mammals}in the fields, the{birds }
 in the (limited) hedgerows and{fish}in
 the rivers and dykes.                 
    Some of the more common flowers    
 include cowslip, primrose, rose-bay   
 willow herb, poppy, campions, iris,   
 ragged-robin and rock-rose.           
    In addition to members of the mouse
 family, rabbits and hares are very    
 common and a fox may often be seen    
 hunting for food.                     
    Swan, moorhen and coot nest near   
 the river where herons are often seen.
 The lapwing, skylark and swallow are  
 very common as are most members of the
 thrush and finch families,whilst owls,
 kestrel and harrier quarter the area. 
    A wide variety of fish are to be   
 found in the rivers and dykes.        </content>
