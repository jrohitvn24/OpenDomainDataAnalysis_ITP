		<content> AUTUMN                                
  In autumn the farmer ploughs,        
 cultivates and then plants the winter 
 wheat, barley and oats. The seed is   
 bought from a seed merchant and comes 
 with a seed dressing that kills       
 certain pests and protects the grain  
 from certain diseases. The seed is put
 into the ground together with a       
 complete fertilizer that contains     
 nitrogen, phosphate and potash. After 
 planting the ground is sprayed with a 
 weed killer                           
 WINTER                                
  In winter the sheep and cattle are   
 indoors and so have to be feed and    
 watered. The sheds also have to be    
 cleaned out, the manure is kept to    
 spread on the fields and new bedding  
 straw put down. Some stored corn is   
 sold, the machinery maintained and the
 hedges are trimmed.                   </content>
