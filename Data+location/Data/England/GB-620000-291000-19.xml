		<content>    My name is{Mabel Whitham,}and I    
 live in the small village of{Fritton. 
 I live in a brick cottage on the edge 
 of a{common}overlooking a pond        
 inhabited by thirty{ducks.}My first   
 chore of the day is making a pot of   
 tea, then I tidy up my house and do   
 any washing that is lying around. When
 the papers arrive I usually have a    
 look at them and perhaps do the       
 crossword. I then go round to help my 
 sister who lives next door as she has 
 poor eyesight. Then I have my lunch   
 and gather vegetables from the garden 
 as they come in season. After lunch I 
 do some weeding, grass cutting in the 
 garden. Later in the afternoon I take 
 my dog for a walk. At about 5.15 I    
 have tea and then watch the news on   
 the television.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
