		<content>  This is a very rural area with       
 virtually no amenities. The nearest   
 town is Wareham, six miles away, and  
 as there is only one bus per week from
 Bere Regis to Wareham for residents to
 visit the Purbeck District Council    
 Offices, Employment Exchange, shops,  
 banks, etc., it is essential to have  
 the use of a car. There is a little   
 employment locally, on farms, at the  
 sawmills, Golf Club, small industries 
 and fruit farm; otherwise residents   
 travel to Poole, Blandford, Wareham,  
 Dorchester, Bovington Camp and        
 Winfrith Atomic Energy Station for    
 employment, and also for shopping.    
 Children may attend playschool at Bere
 Regis at the age of three years, and  
 formal education begins at five years 
 when they attend Bere Regis County    
 First School until the age of nine.
