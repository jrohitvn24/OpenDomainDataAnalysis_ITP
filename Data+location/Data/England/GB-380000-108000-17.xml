		<title>17MY HOME</title>
		<content> My house is semi-detached.  It has    
 three bedrooms, a lounge, a kitchen, a
 bathroom and an extra toilet outside. 
 It also has a conservatory. My house  
 is quite old. It is in the main       
 village street in Okeford Fitzpaine   
 and is a listed building.             
 There are four of us in my family, my 
 mum, my dad, my sister and me.  I have
 a pet hamster and he lives in the     
 conservatory. My mum lets me play with
 him there but she doesn't like him in 
 the rest of the house.                
                                       
 Outside we have a garden.There are two
 sheds in the garden and a garage.We   
 also have a greenhouse.
