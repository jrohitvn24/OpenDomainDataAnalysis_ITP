{BYLAND ABBEY}MINED AND SMELTED IRON   
 ORE. THEIR CENTRE IN EMLEY WAS{BENTLEY
{GRANGE}(266134). THEY MINED USING     
{BELL PITS }METHOD. A PIT WAS SUNK TO A
 DEPTH OF 7 METRES AND WORKED OUTWARDS 
 FROM THE BOTTOM. WHEN THE ROOF BEGAN  
 TO COLLAPSE, FLOODING OR AIR BECAME   
 BAD A NEW PIT WAS SUNK AND THE OLD ONE
 FILLED IN.                            
{BELL PITS}DATING FROM{16th CENTURY}CAN
 BE SEEN ON EITHER SIDE OF WOODHOUSE
