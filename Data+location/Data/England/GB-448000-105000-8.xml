		<title>08History of Locks Heath.</title>
		<content> From{1066-1222},the area encompassing 
 the parish of Locks Heath was owned by
 the Crown.In{1222},Henry III gave the 
 land,and its manor, to the Bishop of  
 Winchester.He demanded that the area  
 should provide all food and provisions
 for the newly founded Titchfield      
 Abbey.After the dissolution in        
{1540},the lands passed to successive  
 owners although the local people were 
 still allowed their common rights.    
  In{1866}an Act of Parliament allowed 
 for the enclosure of much of the land.
 Only the rich could afford the Â£3000  
 needed to buy a plot.They quickly     
 established small-holdings growing    
 fruits and vegetables for the markets.
 As roads improved, the markets grew   
 larger and further afield.Soon        
 labourers were needed to work the     
 fields.Many settled and made Locks    
 Heath their home.                     </content>
