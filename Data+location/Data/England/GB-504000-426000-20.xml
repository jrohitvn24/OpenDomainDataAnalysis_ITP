		<title>20WEST HULL COMMUNITY CENTRES</title>
		<content>  THERE ARE FOUR COMMUNITY CENTRES IN  
 W. HULL; THEY FIRST APPEARED IN THE   
 LATE SEVENTIES, WHEN LOCAL PEOPLE     
 STARTED TO ORGANISE THEIR OWN LEISURE 
 ACTIVITIES, AND BRING PRESSURE ON THE 
 AUTHORITIES TO PROTECT THEIR HOUSING  
 AND OPEN LAND.                        
  THE ASSOCIATION LOOKS FOR AN OLD SITE
 PAYS A CHEAP RENT; AND WITH THE HELP  
 OF LOCAL SCHOOLS, UNEMPLOYED, AND     
 RETIRED PEOPLE, SETS ABOUT ITS        
 RENOVATION. THE PROJECTS ARE FUNDED BY
 AN INNER CITY GRANT, AND JUMBLE SALES.
  THE CENTRES ARE STAFFED BY VOLUNTEERS
 WHO RUN PLAY GROUPS, BINGO FOR THE    
 ELDERLY, YOUTH CLUBS, KEEP FIT GROUPS 
 HOBBIES ROOMS, AND PROVIDE A CENTRE   
 WHERE ANY LOCAL PEOPLE CAN GO FOR A   
 CHAT OR TO HOLD MEETINGS. ONE CENTRE  
 PUT PRESSURE ON THE AUTHORITY TO      
 IMPROVE AND MODERNISE A WHOLE STREET  
 INSTEAD OF ITS PLANNED DEMOLITION.    </content>
