		<content> There was a knock at the door;It was  
 Debbie our next door neighbour.She    
 asked if we would baby sit for her.I  
 said yes.At 6 p.m. the baby started to
 cry so I gave it it's dummy but it    
 spat it out,so I thought that he      
 wanted his bottle.This was made up and
 given to him.My mum then told me to   
 lay him done to sleep.I took upstairs 
 to his cot and then sneaked back down 
 stairs again.I sat down to watch the  
 "Price is Right".Suddenley the lights 
 went off and the television too.So my 
 mum got a 50 pence piece off the      
 cornish and put it in the             
 electricity meter.Everything came back
 on again                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
