		<content>   After walking home from school at 3 
p.m. I let myself in as my mum is not  
usually home from work. I get myself a 
glass of milk, one cracker with butter 
on it and two with cheese on them. I   
usually watch television until my mum, 
two sisters and dad come home.         
Sometimes I watch a hospital series    
called "Young Doctors" but it is often 
quite boring. I like the childrens'    
programmes, especially cartoon films, I
like animal cartoons best.   When      
mum comes home she gets dinner ready,  
we often have stew followed by a pie   
and coffee with chocolate. After       
dinner Dad and I often go to the       
recreation field and play tennis.      
After watching some more television I  
usually go to bed at about 9 p.m.
