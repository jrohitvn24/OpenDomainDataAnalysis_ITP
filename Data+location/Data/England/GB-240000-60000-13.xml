 Fortunately a large housing estate was
 built at Hatt (outside our block) and 
 the children from Hatt Village were   
 zoned to Landulph School. During 1983 
 virtually a new school was built using
 the old building as an assembly hall, 
 gym and dining area. The new buildings
 consisted of 3 purpose-built          
 classrooms, workspace, library, indoor
 cloakrooms and toilets, and kitchen. A
 sports field was also purchased from  
 the Duchy of Cornwall. Present numbers
 in the school fluctuate between 75 and
 90. The children on leaving school go 
 on to secondary education at Saltash  
 or Callington Comprehensives, or      
 private education.
