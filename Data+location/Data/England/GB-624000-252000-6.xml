		<content>     There is an amateur dramatic group
in Bredfield called the "B.A.D.S."     
There are also other clubs and groups  
which hold their meetings in the       
village hall. These are Bredfield and  
District Community Council, the        
Parochial Church Council, the Women's  
Institute, the Mothers' Union, the     
Ladies' Group, the Over Sixties' Club, 
the Youth Club, the Mother and Toddler 
Club and the Indoor Bowls Club. Others 
use the courts and pitches out on the  
field like the Bredfield and District  
Tennis Club, the Football team and the 
Bowls Club. The membership is drawn    
from the whole area and sometimes as   
far away as Woodbridge but all are     
well supported.
