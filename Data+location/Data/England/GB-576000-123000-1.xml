		<title>01BODIAM AND EWHURST</title>
		<content>    In this area, which mainly consists
 of{woodland}and{grassland},there are  
 two small areas of habitation - the   
{villages}of Bodiam and Ewhurst.       
 Bodiam, once well known to Londoners  
 for its{hop-picking}season, now relies
 upon the ancient{castle}to attract    
 seasonal visitors.                    
    Ewhurst, voted "Best kept village  
 in Sussex" in 1981, is a  rather more 
 isolated community of residents. Other
 prominent features in the area include
 the{river}Rother , which eventually   
 flows into the English Channel at Rye,
 and the main A229{road}, along which  
 people travel between Hawkhurst and   
 the A21 from London to Hastings. In   
 essence this is an area of quiet      
 countryside utilized mainly by a      
 number of{farms}and two small         
 communities of people.
