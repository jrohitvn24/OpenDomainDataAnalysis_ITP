		<title>06THE CASTLE AT CASTLE BYTHAM</title>
		<content> All that remains of what was once the 
 most dominant of buildings            
 is a large grassy mound.It was        
 probably built by a Norman called     
 Drogo,a relative of William the       
 Conqueror,who needed to defend himself
 from the last of the Saxons in these  
 parts,Hereward the Wake and his       
 nephews Edwin and Morcar.What was the 
 castle like ? We can only tell a      
 little from the remains_a moated site_
 part of the moat still exists,but no  
 longer goes right round the castle    
 hill.Ontop of the hill would be a     
 square "keep" surrounded by walls with
 towers at the corners.It is thought   
 that possibly there was a larger tower
 at the N.E. corner.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
