		<content>    Probably half the working          
 population is involved in farm work of
 some kind or another,whilst the other 
 half follow a variety of professions. 
 There is a whinstone quarry and       
 concrete pipe works just outside our  
 block where about a dozen of our      
 inhabitants work.There are three shops
 and a public house which employ a     
 further eight people.Most other people
 travel outside the block to work;they 
 include a sea-going engineer,a        
 physiotherapist,an architect,six civil
 servants,a railway signalman,a        
 plumber,a miner, the clerk of works at
 Acklington Prison,school_teachers and 
 a variety of others.On the whole there
 is little permanent unemployment      
 mainly due to the R.A.F.presence and  
 successful farming.
