		<title>10Watton Priory</title>
		<content> Locally known as Watton "Abbey", the  
 ruins of the Priory are situated on   
 the south-eastern outskirts of Watton,
 about 8 miles from Beverley and 5     
 miles from Driffield.                 
 Tanner, in "Notitia Monastica" (1787) 
 states that a nunnery existed here in 
 686 AD. This follows an account by    
 Bede of a miracle performed at the    
 nunnery by St. John of Beverley after 
 he became Bishop of York in 705 AD.   
 St. John is said to have restored a   
 nun to health.                        
 Aethelred, or Aelred, Abbot of        
 Rievaulx, 1146-66, mentions another   
 miracle at Watton and describes the   
 Priory.                               
 The Saxon monastery at Watton, if ever
 there was one, had ceased to exist    
 by 1066 - there is no record in the   
 Domesday Book, although Watton had    
 its own priest and church.            </content>
