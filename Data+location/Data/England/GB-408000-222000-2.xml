		<content>    Our village is different from many 
 other villages, because half the      
 houses belong to a Charitable Trust,  
 60 out of a total of 120. 270 people  
 approximately live here.              
    The oldest house is thought to be  
 early 16th century. The original Saxon
 village was round the church, but when
 the village first had a market in 1330
 the Square became the centre.         
    Many of the present houses were    
 built about 1830,when the population  
 rose to 792,as Irish labourers came to
 work in local quarries, producing     
 stone for roads, railways and houses. 
    The present Lord of the Manor      
 improved all Manor property between   
 1958 and 1964, and made it over to a  
 Charitable Trust,whose policy is to   
 provide housing at a reasonable rent  
 for local people. Six maintenance     
 workers look after the property.      </content>
