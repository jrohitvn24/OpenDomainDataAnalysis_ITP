		<content> The old village school was founded 113
 years ago, and closed 16 years ago    
 (1969) when the present school was    
 built.                                
  The 'new' school has at present      
 (1985) 60 pupils in 3 classes.        
       {Class 1.......5-7 yrs          
{       Class 2.......7-9 yrs          
       {Class 3.......9-11 yrs}        
 The Headteacher is Mr.Barker and he   
 teaches mainly class 3.               
  We do mathematics, writing, language,
 reading, science, history, geography, 
 art/craft, music, dance, sport, health
 education and lots of other things.   
  We use a computer, keep pets and play
 games like table tennis, badminton,   
 cricket and football at break times.  
  School times are 09.00-15.30 except  
 when there are clubs after school.    
  Most pupils have their lunch at      
 school and we have our own kitchens.  </content>
