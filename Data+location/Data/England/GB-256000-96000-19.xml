		<title>19LOCAL NEWS</title>
		<content>   The main news recently in Folly Gate
 was that the{Crossways Inn}has been   
 re-opened after being closed for over 
 a year and a half.  As the pub is the 
 main meeting place for people in{Folly
{Gate}the people were very pleased to  
 see it opened again.                  
   The morning after the pub re-opened 
 one of the local farmers went to      
 collect his cows for milking and when 
 some of them got up to walk they      
 seemed drunk.  They called the vet and
 he said it was the sugar in the grass 
 formenting not the result of the pub  
 re-opening!                           
   Folly Gate is on the main{Holiday   
{Route}and this makes the road very    
 busy in the summer so it has been     
 widened during the last year and a    
 footpath has been constructed to      
 improve safety while walking along the
 road.                                 </content>
