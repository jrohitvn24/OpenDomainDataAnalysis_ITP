		<title>10PLAYGROUND GAMES AT OVERBURY</title>
		<content> In the school playground some of the  
 games we like playing are :{Stuck In  
{The Mud}-We choose somebody to be     
 on,then they have to chase you and if 
 you are tagged (touched with a hand   
 )you stand still with legs wide       
 apart.If somebody goes under your legs
 you are free to run off.              
{Tally Ho}-We choose somebody to be on.
 The other players stand by a wall at  
 one side of the playground.The person 
 who is on chooses another player to   
 try to run across the playground to   
 the opposite side.If they are         
 caught,they then have to be on with   
 the person who called them.If they get
 to the other side they shout{"Tally   
{Ho"}and all the other people try to   
 run across the playground without     
 being caught.The game then continues  
 in the opposite direction.            
                                       </content>
