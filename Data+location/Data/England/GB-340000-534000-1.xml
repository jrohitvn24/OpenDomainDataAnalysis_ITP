 The Skelton area is a quiet           
 agricultural region to the North East 
 of the Lake District. The land rises  
 in a series of steps from 192m in the 
 NE to 350m in the W, on the steps are 
 the villages of Skelton, Ellonby and  
 Lamonby, Skelton is the most important
 having a shop, public house, church,  
 chapel, post office, village hall and 
 Primary School. The landscape is      
 dominated by pasture land but there   
 are important woodland areas, many    
 hedgerows and small streams (called   
 becks).                               
 The villages are pleasant and quiet   
 with a mixture of house_types. Almost 
 all homes have gardens and many       
 are detached properties. The villages 
 have an active social scene with many 
 clubs and other activities.
