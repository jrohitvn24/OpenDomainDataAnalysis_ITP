     Louise telephoned after tea to ask
 me if I wanted to play so I went to   
her house. First we went to the shop,  
then we called for Jane, then we went  
to play in our garage. After that we   
went to my Auntie DorisÂ£s and it rained
so we all went home very wet.  When I  
got in I practised my organ then I had 
some toast. Louise rang again to ask me
to come early in the morning so I asked
her if she would be my partner for our 
visit to the baths. I said goodnight to
my mum and my dad and then I went to   
bed                                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
