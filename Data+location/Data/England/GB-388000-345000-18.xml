		<title>18BUCKNALL HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>The hospital,built off Eaves Lane      
Bucknall was created in 1886 for the   
treatment of smallpox in Hanley,Stoke  
and Longton.Even then,however,the      
smallpox problem was declining and as  
new wards were added it became an      
isolation hospital treating all        
infectious cases in North              
Staffordshire. In 1953 some wards were 
given over to the care of the aged     
sick.It is now the main centre for     
geriatric care in North Staffordshire  
with outpatient and physiotherapy      
departments and one ward solely for    
pneumoconiosis victims. The hospital   
is set in its own pleasant grounds and 
commands good views of the area.It is  
a well regarded institution in the     
neighbourhood.The change from          
isolation to geriatric care reflects   
the considerable improvements in local 
health standards over the last century.</content>
