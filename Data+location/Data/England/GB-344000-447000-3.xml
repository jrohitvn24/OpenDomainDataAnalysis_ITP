		<title>03Development of Winmarleigh</title>
		<content> After the Wilson-Pattens bought the   
 manor they held it as absentee lords, 
 like many another.However the indust- 
 rial growth of Warrington,pressing in 
 upon Bank Hall,persuaded Colonel John 
 Wilson-Patten to rebuild a new        
 residence in Winmarleigh,where he came
 annually to shoot and course.This move
 brought great change and benefit.     
 From about 1850 onwards the Colonel   
 had been improving land by drainage   
 and enclosure,reclaiming bog and      
 repairing and rebuilding property.    
 It is from 1870,at the time of the    
 building of the{Hall,}that the work   
 gained impetus.                       
 The present village with a church,a   
 school,a Hall and parkland,a large    
 vicarage and good former labourers'   
 cottages,post-dates 1870.The village  
 in those days in particular owed a    
 debt of gratitude to Colonel John.    </content>
