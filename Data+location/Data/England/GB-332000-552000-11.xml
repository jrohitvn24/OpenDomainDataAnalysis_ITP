		<title>11St Giles Church, Great Orton</title>
		<content> St Giles Church is the only church    
 with that name in the diocese of      
 Cumbria. The church, built in 1098 is 
 of stone which would be cut and shaped
 before delivery. Some of the stones   
 were taken from the Roman Wall. The   
 outside walls are straight but the    
 inner walls lean outwards giving it an
 arc shape. The west end of the church 
 was once the school. Originally the   
 patron saint was St Kentigern but in  
 1300 it was discovered the church was 
 dedicated to St Giles. There are      
 lovely stained glass windows to the   
 memory of both saints. The rector     
 showed us the service book which is a 
 record of services held in the church;
 the baptismal book,&amp; the wedding &amp;    
 funeral records.The registers date    
 from 1586, althoughthere is a break   
 from 1639-1665.During the Civil War   
 records were buried in a field.       </content>
