       In Downe there are four mansions
 and a number of smaller old houses and
 cottages.  There is a small estate of 
 newer houses built in 1970.           
       In the middle of the landscap   
 and buildings is a lime tree with a   
 bench around it; sometimes people who 
 are waiting for the bus sit there.    
 There is a Crystals minibus service   
 and a single decker bus service to    
 Bromley.                              
       Downe has two pubs and a        
 restaurant. People come to Downe to   
 walk round the many footpaths, go     
 horse riding, visit Downe House or    
 High Elms.                            
       The only shops are a newsagents 
 and a post office with a food store.  
 There is a small primary school, a
