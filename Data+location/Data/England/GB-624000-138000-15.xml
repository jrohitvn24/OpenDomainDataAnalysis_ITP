		<content>   The first Village Hall was built    
 straight after the Second World War,  
 wood from the Airship Shed (now the   
 Blue Channel Caravan site) was used in
 its building.A new Village Hall was   
 built in 1980.  .                     
   This Village Hall is used by many   
 clubs and societies e.g.the visiting  
 library Badminton,Brownies,Guides,    
 Cubs Scouts,the Gardener's Club,      
 Dancing,Youth Club,the Women's        
 Institute and Play Group.             
    There is a committee which runs the
 Village Hall and regularly holds      
 dances and discos to raise funds for  
 the Hall.  Each July the Capel        
 Spectacular is held.This is a week of 
 activities starting with a Fun Run and
 including a Village Quiz (our teachers
 put in a team),demonstrations,dances  
 and ending on Saturday with a Grand
