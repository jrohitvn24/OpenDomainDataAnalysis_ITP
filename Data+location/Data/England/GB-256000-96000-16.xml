		<content>   Folly Gate has got a{Village Hall } 
 which is used for many events during  
 the year. It is looked after by Mrs.  
 Orchard who is the caretaker.         
   The village people hold functions in
 it. They have a{Whist Drive}three     
 times a year which is a type of card  
 game where they have lots of tables   
 with people playing cards on them and 
 when one person wins he or she moves  
 to the next table. All the money goes 
 to the football club, the darts team  
 and the church, so it's all in a good 
 cause. They also hold parties like    
 birthdays, Christmas and christenings.
   In September they have a Harvest    
 Festival.{Eggesford Hunt}have a meet  
 at the Crossways Inn and they hold{   
 a dance the night before in the
