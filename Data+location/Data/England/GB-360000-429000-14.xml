		<title>14THE OVER HALL OF SAMLESBURY</title>
		<content>SAMLESBURY HALL was built about 1325 by
Gilbert de Southworth , whose wife was 
descended from the first recorded lord 
of Samlesbury.It is a beautiful timber 
framed structure, decorated with quatre
foils.The Great Hall has an orielwindow
and massive timbers support the  roof. 
A window and carved screen which was   
in the chapel came from Whalley Abbey. 
The Southworths lived there until 1678 
when the Braddylls bought it and       
removed the beautiful carved woodwork  
oak panelling and chapel screen to     
their new home,Conishead Priory.       
Labourers and handloom weavers rented  
rooms and it eventually became ruinous.
The hall was converted into a pub in   
1826, a school in 1850 and a residence 
for the Harrisons in 1862. In 1925 it  
was saved from demolition by public sub
scription and is now owned by a Trust. 
There are two priestholes and a ghost. </content>
