		<content>  Kendal is known as the{Gateway to the
{Lakes.}People who are staying in the  
 Lake District come into Kendal, as it 
 is the main shopping centre. Not many 
 people stay in Kendal, but lots of    
 people visit it. Hotels include the   
{County, Woolpack, Gateway,}and a      
 number of guest houses. Most people   
 come to see places of interest such as
{Abbot Hall, the Museum of Lakeland    
{Life and Industry, and the castle.}In 
 September there is the{Kendal         
{Gathering}which includes a{Torchlight 
{Procession,}concerts, and other events
 which extend the tourist season into  
 September. Holidays in UK have become 
 more popular since the foreign        
 exchange rate became unfavourable and 
 local trade has grown as{"mini-breaks"
 at off peak times gain popularity     
 especially with retired people        
 who enjoy a quiet, rural holiday.     </content>
