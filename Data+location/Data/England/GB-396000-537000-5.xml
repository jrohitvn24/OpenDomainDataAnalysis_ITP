		<title>05Fashions In Stanhope.</title>
		<content>  The ladies in Stanhope this year will
 be wearing clothes in pastel shades.  
 Jeans are still very popular made of  
 denim,but canvas jeans are becoming   
 more popular.Skirts and tops are      
 fashionable for ladies from thirty    
 upwards.The clothes are mostly made of
 cotton and man made fibres like       
 terylene,nylon and acrylic.The most   
 fashionable footwear is Tucker boots. 
  The problems of owning a fashion shop
 are keeping up with the fashion.      
  Baby clothes are mostly bought for   
 gifts,but a lot of mothers buy wool to
 knit traditional styles for their     
 babies.Men mostly wear casual shirts, 
 cotton or terylene trousers and shoes.
 The prices of these clothes range     
 from Â£2_Â£100.                         
  The hair fashion is mostly long at   
 the back, short on top and permed to  
 make it wavey.                        </content>
