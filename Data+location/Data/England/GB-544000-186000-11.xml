		<content>{    Postman Chipperfield.             
 About 1863, Chadwell Heath got its    
{first Sub Post Office.}It stood on the
 corner of Chadwell Heath Lane and High
 Road. Nearby there still stands a     
{Victorian postbox.}George Chipperfield
 was one of Chadwell's first postmen.  
 He had a big beard and every morning  
 at 7 o'clock he set out on his rounds.
 Most of his round was over{farmland   
{and countryside.}It was over 7 miles  
 long and it was lunch time before he  
 got back to the Post Office. People   
 used to look forward to his knock and 
 receiving good news. Up until the     
 second world war, Postman Chipperfield
 was a well known figure in Chadwell   
 Heath.
