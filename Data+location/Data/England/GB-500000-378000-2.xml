		<title>02INTERVIEW WITH RESIDENT 1.</title>
		<content> A third year pupil interviewed Mrs.   
 Owen who had lived in Welton most of  
 her life.###########################  
 When you came to Welton at the age of 
 21 what sort of entertainment was     
 there?                                
 There were many dances in the Primary 
 School,this was the only place for    
 everything. I also went to Whist      
 Drives and played tennis.             
 What jobs were available in Welton?   
 Not many, mainly work on the land,    
 I spent two years working on a farm,  
 then owing to the Second World War I  
 had to go to Lincoln to work in a     
 factory making hinges for ammunition  
 boxes.                                
 How has life changed for you?         
 Oh, I enjoy it much more now,it's just
 like one big holiday.  I don't have to
 work and all my spare time is taken up
 helping to run organizations in Welton</content>
