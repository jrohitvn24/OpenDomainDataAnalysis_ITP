		<title>02MATERNITY UNIT TO CLOSE.</title>
		<content> The Maternity unit at Orsett Hospital 
 is to close by the end of 1985,and    
 there is growing concern that the much
 used Casualty deartment will close    
 very soon.It has been rumoured that   
 the emergency unit at Orsett will be  
 moved to Basildon Hospital about 8    
 miles away.Apparently they have three 
 options-firstly to close both Basildon
 and Orsett Hospitals emergency        
 units-secondly keeping one open full  
 time and the other part time,and      
 thirdly leaving them both open full   
 time and saving costs in other        
 areas.The Casualty department in      
 Orsett is used by 42,000 people a year
 and Basildon by 50,000.The Regional   
 Health Authority will make the final  
 decision
