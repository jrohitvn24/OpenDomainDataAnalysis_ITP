		<title>17THE WATERMILL</title>
		<content>    The watermill, in the centre of the
 town was closed down in 1969 following
 the flood of Edenbridge in September  
 1968 and the fracture of the giant    
 cast_iron pit wheel. The mill is      
 locally known as 'Honours Mill' after 
 the family who have been associated   
 with it since 1928. They had          
 permission to restore the mill in 1976
 but this has not been done and the    
 mill is now up for sale.              
    The water supply for the mill flows
 from a channel dug some three_        
 quarters of a mile upstream from the  
 bridge. This was probably dug in the  
 early 15th Century, an amazing feat   
 of engineering considering its length,
 width and depth....by Gerald Heasman.
