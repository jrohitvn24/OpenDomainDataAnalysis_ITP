 parents in the village school.Here are
 our results.1 Estate agent:1 Riding

  Pre-1945,practically everyone in the 
 village worked on the farms. Now only 
 the owner and his immediate family    
 work each farm.More people commute    
 than work here.                       
 Other than working on the family farm,
 school leavers have to find jobs else 
 where.
