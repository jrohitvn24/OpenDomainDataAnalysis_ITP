		<title>1875th ANNIVERSARY - GUIDES</title>
		<content> 1985 saw the 75th birthday of the Girl
 Guide movement in the U.K.To celebrate
 this, the Guides and Brownies of the  
 Harefield area attended a"Fun Day" at 
 the John Penrose Leisure Centre, where
 the Harefield area hosted 400 Brownies
 of the Uxbridge division.             
 Guiding began in the village in the   
 1930's and the late 1960's and early  
 1970's saw the greatest number of     
 girls (ages 7 to 18) enrolled.        
 In 1985 the numbers enrolled are 24   
 Guides, 68 Brownies and 7 Guiders.    
 This represents a fall of             
 approximately 45% since 1972.         
 World wide, the Girl Guide Movement is
 as strong and as active as ever and is
 always ready to adapt its programme to
 meet modern needs.
