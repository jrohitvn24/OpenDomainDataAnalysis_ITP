		<title>04COBERLEY: ENTERTAINMENT</title>
		<content>  Coberley village is a small one, with
 only 80 people in it. Some have lived 
 there all their lives, others are     
 newcomers.The village has very little 
 entertainment but they do have a barn 
 dance, fete, country lunch each year. 
 The barn dance is fun and everybody   
 enjoys it. It allows people from other
 villages to enjoy it too. The country 
 lunch is held at Coberley scjool. You 
 pay money to the school to play games 
 at the country lunch. The fete is     
 seemingly like the country lunch, but 
 it has more people and different      
 stalls. At the fete there is a        
 majority of adults in charge of the   
 stalls, but in the country lunch the  
 children operate it. In the village   
 there is a church which has services  
 each week and also there is a Sunday  
 school.                               
                                       </content>
