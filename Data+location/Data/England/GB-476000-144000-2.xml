		<content> In the past the village was often     
 referred to as{"Bentley Green"}rather 
 repeating its name as Bentley means   
{"grass clearing in the forest".}That  
 being{Alice Holt Forest}now only      
 remaining to the South, and the       
 research headquarters of the{Forestry}
{Commission.}The "greens" have largely 
 disappeared but still exist in village
 names viz.:_ East Green, South Green, 
 Carter's Green and Green Farm. The    
 value of these "greens" as a route    
 through the forest can be judged from 
 the fact that ordinance required the  
 road to be "wide enough for sixteen   
 knights in armour to ride abreast" and
 yet was still an ideal site for an    
 ambush on wealthy travellers.
