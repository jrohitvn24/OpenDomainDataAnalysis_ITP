		<content>{ Mortimer Hall}is a small, modern     
 building situated on the corner of    
{Oxford Rd}on the outskirts of{Old}    
{Marston.}It is used for many social   
 meetings and occasions but its main   
 function is its small{library}with a  
 varied range of books. There are two  
 librarians, a part-timer and one who  
 works full time. Although the building
 is fairly new it has a lot of problems
 with damp and rot.                    
  There are also clubs held in the     
 hall. One such club that we found out 
 about was a dancing school under the  
 name of{'Sue's Dancing School'.}It is 
 a small association, run for the young
 children of the area who like to start
 dancing early.                        
  There is also a small hall opposite  
{St Nicholas' Church}which is used in  
 conjunction with the church. It too is
 used for social occasions.            </content>
