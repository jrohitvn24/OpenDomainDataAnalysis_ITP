		<title>11West Cliff Hall Hotel Hythe.</title>
		<content>   In the centre of the survey area    
 which is to the west of the{New Hythe 
{Marina Site,}is West Cliff Hall Hotel.
   It is a large hotel which used to be
 on the coast but now overlooks drained
{Reclaimed Land.                       
   The hotel is on a hill surrounded   
 by woodland.At the bottom of the hill 
 is a railway track used by goods      
 trains serving the{Fawley Oil Refinery
 further south on Southampton Water.   
   The village of Hythe is quite small.
 There were some small terraced and    
 semi_detatched houses, also many      
 large, seemingly spacious houses.     
   Along the shore we found spent      
 cartridges,so some{shooting}takes     
 place here possibly of rabbit and some
 wild birds.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
