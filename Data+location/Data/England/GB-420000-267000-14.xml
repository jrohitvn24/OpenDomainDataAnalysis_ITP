		<content>Population: The average number of      
people living in one house is          
estimated at about five. Pets range    
from fish to horses, tortoises to pigs.
Housing: This was a fairly wealthy area
and the average house had about five   
bedrooms.There was a mixed variety of  
old and modern houses.There are quite  
a few well maintained council houses.  
Employment: Due to the recession many  
people are unemployed, but a lot of    
people in the villages are self-       
employed.  Most employed people comm-  
ute to work, and therefore own two or  
three private cars.                    
Domestic duties: Generally most of the 
domestic duties are done by the women  
in the house.These include washing,    
cleaning, ironing, etc. Few houses     
employ a maid or servant.
