		<title>12BROKE HALL</title>
		<content> Broke Hall was built in red brick by  
Philip Broke in 1558. It is a very     
pretty house. It has excellent views   
over the River Orwell and beautiful    
parkland . Broke Hall had two          
architects. The front porch was added  
in the Eighteenth Century. It was the  
home of Admiral Broke of H.M.S. Shannon
who out-gunned U.S.S. Chesapeake in    
1812 off Boston.                       
 Broke Hall has recently been sold and 
there are plans for it to become a home
for elderly people who are terminally  
ill.
