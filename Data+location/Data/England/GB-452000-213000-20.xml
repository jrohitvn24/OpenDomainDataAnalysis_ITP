		<content>Events,in this area anyway,tend to be  
regular,and connected with fund        
raising.Every year in Oct/Nov there is 
a Three Parishes Fair (Islip,Noke,and  
Woodeaton) in the Islip Village Hall to
raise money for the churches.Last year 
this raised about one thousand pounds  
from a great diversity of stalls       
stocked with local produce,gifts,etc.  
In Islip there is a regular annual     
market on the Cross Tree Green to raise
money for the green itself.These are   
also important social gatherings.2 or 3
years ago Noke opened their village to 
the public.Gardens and places of local 
interest were open and there was a fair
on the playing field.Islip followed    
suit in 1985 with exhibitions in the   
Village Hall,the School and a floral   
display in the church.Mr Tuffrey also  
put on display his collection of       
restored and working farm machinery.   </content>
