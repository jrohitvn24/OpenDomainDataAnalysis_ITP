		<content> The earliest scene's of paintings are 
 of the life of St. James. {The chuch  
{at Stoke Orchard}seems to have been   
 neglected during Victorian times and  
 escaped the "restoration" of those    
 times.  Up to that time many more     
 churches has plastered walls.  Both   
 churches have Norman arches and       
 doorways.  In Tredington church there 
 are fossil remain's in the floor of   
 the porch.  It is possible that it is 
 the bones of a marine reptile of the  
 Jurrasic period.  If so the bones are 
 175 million years old.  People used to
 say that it is a fossil ichthyosaurus,
 but, as it is in pieces, we can't     
 really say that.
