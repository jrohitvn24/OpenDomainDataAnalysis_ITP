		<title>01INFORMATION ON SADDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> This area includes parts of the       
 villages of Diggle and Uppermill, and 
 extends over Saddleworth Moor.        
                                       
 There are two main areas which are    
 inhabited, both being new estates, and
 there are scattered hamlets, such as  
 at Pobgreen. Otherwise, there are     
 isolated farmsteads on the higher     
 ground, and the rest of the area is   
 uninhabitable, being open Pennines    
 moorland, which is boggy in parts.    
                                       
 The summit on the ridge over Uppermill
 and Diggle is Broadstone Hill (454 m.)
 and the A635 road to Holmfirth reaches
 485 m.as it rises over the moors at   
 at the eastern boundary of the area.  
                                       
 The main features of the area are its 
 farming, recreation, industry, and    
 above all, traditions of Saddleworth. </content>
