		<content> Twenty five people were asked to fill 
 in our questionnaire.They all lived in
 the villages of Timsbury and Tunley.  
 They were asked what wildlife they see
 daily. They were asked to consider the
 following animals - rabbits, foxes,   
 squirrels,hares,badgers,hedgehogs,    
 moles,rats and voles.                 
 We conducted our survey in four       
 different places in Timsbury - The    
 Square. The Glebe, Overdale and       
 Greenvale.                            
{Our Results.                          
  We found that more people see night  
 animals than day animals. The animals 
 seen most often were the hedgehog and 
 foxes.                                
 Another survey on birds showed that   
 the robin,starling and sparrow are    
 seen most often in this area.
