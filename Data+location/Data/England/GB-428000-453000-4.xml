 around sixty five thousand.There is   
 very little manufacturing industry in 
 Harrogate,and so most people of       
 working age are employed in the       
 service industries.the exact figures  
 are:3% of the working population are  
 employed in primary production(farming
 and quarrying),22% are employed in    
 manufacturing and building,and the    
 rest are employed in shops,hotels,    
 offices,professional and scientific   
 work and in employment associated with
 the exhibition and conference function
 of the town,for eg. in public houses, 
 restaurants etc.Harrogate is dependent
 on tourists,conferences and shoppers. 
 There are over five hundred           
 conferences each year,keeping many of 
 the people of Harrogate in work.
