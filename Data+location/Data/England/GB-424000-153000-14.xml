 The village hall is one of the newest 
 buildings in the village. It has been 
 built on the recreation ground so that
 it can be used by various sports      
 organisations. The idea of building a 
 village hall came from a meeting of   
 villagrs held in 1977- after the      
 Silver Jubilee celebrations and since 
 then money has been collected to pay  
 for the hall. Mr.P.Gordon was elected 
 chairman and Mr.F.Johnson treasurer.In
 1984 they were able to arrange for the
 hall to be built. It is a timber      
 framed hall and will be well          
 insulated. The cost will be more than 
 Â£93000 of which Â£18000 has been by the
 village. Grants and donations have    
 brought in another Â£50000 and Â£25000  
 has been borrowed.Although not        
 formally opened the hall is used      
 regularly.                            </content>
