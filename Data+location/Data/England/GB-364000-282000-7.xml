		<title>07COMMENTS ON STOTTESDON LIFE</title>
		<content> "..a very friendly place..Snows in    
 winter are a problem as there are     
 banks from Stottesdon village in all  
 directions..snowploughs..late clearing
 our areas..hazardous." "..rural       
 relaxed community..people accept you  
 as you are..interest &amp; care shown by  
 friends &amp; neighbours." "..everyone    
 knows everyone else..very little class
 distinction..we appreciate our privacy
 ..you do need a vehicle to get to     
 shops, doctor.." "..a very beautiful  
 county..away from the constant bustle 
 of industrial chaos..the roads could  
 receive more attention. Some of them  
 are dangerous &amp; in a shocking         
 condition.." "..The village has       
 changed but not too drastically.."    
 "This village has become a dead end,  
 little or no social activities for    
 older people..very limited transport."
 "I like living in Stottesdon.."       </content>
