		<content>  Most fields are bordered by{hedges   
 which are mainly hawthorn but some    
 contain other shrubs and trees and a  
 total of 14 different varieties have  
 been counted.Large{trees}of indigenous
 species grow in the hedges and gardens
 which also contain introduced species.
 The road into the village from the    
 west is lined by a selection of large 
 trees.All elms have been killed in    
 recent years by Dutch Elm Disease but 
 are suckering again.Because of        
 intensive cultivation{wild flowers}are
 now only found in hedge bottoms,      
 dumbles,woods,and unmanaged pasture   
 but there are a large number of common
 species.Ramsons grow well in the      
 dumbles,and rarer species such as     
 coltsfoot,violets,primroses,toadflax, 
 ladys smock,yellow iris,geranium,poppy
 ragged robin,wood sorrel and for-get- 
 me-nots are found elsewhere.          </content>
