		<title>14Farms and farmers</title>
		<content> The area is rural in parts having many
 old farms, which are mostly dairy.    
 Four farmers were interviewed.        
 Ramgreave Hall Farm is the oldest     
 building dating from 1600 when it was 
 used as a hunting lodge by James I. It
 has 100 beef cattle on 179 acres and  
 has not been modernised or extended. A
 coin probably from the 18th century   
 has been found by the farmer.         
 Horns Farm has a dairy herd of 75     
 Fresians. The farmer and his two      
 helpers use 3 tractors to run the     
 farm. Old Thatch Farm was a dairy     
 farm, but now all the land has been   
 sold off and the farmhouse used       
 privately. Hocking House Farm has 35  
 Fresians and 50 sheep on 40 acres. The
 farmer sells his milk on a milk round.
 He has either untreated or pasteurised
 milk. He uses two helpers, a tractor  
 and mower.                            </content>
