		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Nearly all the land is pasture, but a 
 few fields are used for crops. There  
 are two small settlements, Idridgehay 
 and Shottle. Idridgehay is set in a   
 rural area, and so is Shottle. The    
 farmland is for cattle and just about 
 all fields are used for grass.        
 Idridgehay is set in the bottom of a  
 valley. On one side of the valley     
 Alport Hill is the last hill of the   
 pennines. It divides the area into    
 two. Idridgehay has one main road and 
 only one railway that only carries    
 cargo. Idridgehay is best described as
 a village, where as Shottle is a      
 hamlet. The Ecclesbourne river flows  
 through the valley. Idridgehay has a  
 school, pub, church, and a shop that  
 is a post office and petrol station.  
 Shottle has a few houses and farms,   
 and a church with a monthly service.
