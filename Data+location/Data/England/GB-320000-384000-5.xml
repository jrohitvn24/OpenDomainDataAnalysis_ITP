		<content>   The majority of people who live in  
 West Kirby,Caldy and Newton work for  
 the most part in Liverpool,Birkenhead 
 or in the industrial centres on the   
 northern part of the Wirral.          
   Much of the employment within the   
 area is in the lower paid service     
 industries and provides a lot of part 
 time work.                            
   Those people who work in Liverpool  
 or Birkenhead commute daily by car,bus
 or train.There is a lot of movement   
 in and out of the area because of the 
 demands of employment.                
   There is a large and growing        
 population of elderly retired people  
 who find this a good area to retire   
 into.This has created employment as   
 sheltered housing and old peoples     
 homes are opened.West kirby with its  
 flat centre and facilities is ideal   
 for these people.                     </content>
