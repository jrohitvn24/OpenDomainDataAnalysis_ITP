		<title>18ODIHAM  COMMON</title>
		<content> Odiham Common is north-east of the    
 town, near Broad Oak Village. The     
 primary land cover is deciduous       
 woodland, with enclosed, rough grazing
 land. Parts of the common are wet and 
 boggy. The area supports a rich       
 variety of plant and animal life. The 
 largest building is the Old Hunting   
 Lodge,  with its own fishing pond.    
 They are privately owned and well     
 maintained by the owners. It is on the
 site of Henry V11's old hunting lodge.
 A smaller cottage in the area is owned
 by a well known actor.                
 The common is a popular place for bird
 watchers, hikers and people, walking  
 their dogs. Along the canal banks grow
 a variety of wild flowers and mature  
 trees. Where the public are allowed to
 fish in the canal, there are Pike,    
 Tench, Carp and Perch. A variety of   
 water insects thrive in the canal.    </content>
