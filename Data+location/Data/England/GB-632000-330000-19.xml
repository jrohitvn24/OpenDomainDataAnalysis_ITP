		<content>{Ridlington Church}The village is      
 divided over the possible closure of  
 the Church.Â£30,000 is needed to repair
 the tower,in addition to the annual   
 Diocesan Quota.Some feel that the     
 scattered population &amp; poor numbers at
 services mean this is not a practical 
 undertaking.                          
{Crostwight Heath}Owing to vociferous  
 protest the burning of the heath was  
 postponed from spring to autumn.This  
 is a popular beauty spot &amp; home for   
 many birds.Concern is also about      
 controlling the burning.              
{Main Services}Owing to flat land &amp;    
 high water table most houses have     
 trouble with septic tank rdainage.The 
 emptying charge is Â£22.A small plant  
 services council houses in Ridlington.
{Health services}There is widespread   
 concern over possible closure of the
