		<content>{Eastern Library Bitterne}is well used.
 About sixteen thousand books are taken
 out weekly.More unemployed are using  
 the library now.All ages use the      
 library but people in their teens and 
 early twenties use the library least. 
 The new precinct has made a difference
 to the use of the library.Older people
 found difficulty in using the library 
 when the precinct and the bypass were 
 being built because the library was on
 the other side of the main road.Now   
 the roads and precinct have been      
 built,more people are using the       
 library again. People come to the     
 library for information on local and  
 national events as well as to borrow  
 books.There are plenty of reference   
 books.I am{Joan Slater}and I belong to
 this public library.I am fussy about  
 the books I read but this library     
 always has a very good selection.     </content>
