		<content> There are five main areas of          
 employment :-                         
                                       
  FARM,GARAGE,SCHOOL,"CARE",SANDPITS   
                                       
 Most local inhabitants work outside   
 the area. The remainder  work on farms
 for local small businesses, such as   
 garages, shops and other service      
 industries and for community related  
 services such as St. Michael's School.
 The Sandpits at Heathend and Coates   
 are the only employment geared up     
 towards producing something ( apart   
 from farming ); the sand is used for  
 building purposes.                    
                                       
 A family-run garage at Heathend  with 
 an agency for east european cars      
 employs about six people to repair    
 cars, serve petrol on the forecourt   
 etc.                       (continued)</content>
