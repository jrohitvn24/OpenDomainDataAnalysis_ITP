		<title>15MY HOUSE IN SHREWTON</title>
		<content> I live at No. 3 London Road, Shrewton.
 Our house is a Council House, which   
 has just been modernised with a new   
 bathroom and central heating too.     
 We have three bedrooms and two        
 toilets, but it is not really big     
 enough for our family of six.         
 I am the eldest boy and I have two    
 younger brothers and a baby sister.   
 My brothers share my bedroom with me  
 and my sister has a room to herself.  
 Our garden is a fairly large one, with
 a young plum tree and an old apple    
 tree.                                 
 At the top of the garden we grow      
 rhubarb, and at the front my Mum grows
 flowers.  We have a swing to play on.
