		<content>Children going to school also need to  
use the shops,children from the bigger 
schools around this area use the "Fish 
and Chips" shop for most of their      
dinner, but they also go into the      
"Spar" shop for mid-morning snacks).   
They are only allowed to have this     
privilege if they are responsible      
for getting back to school on time.    
   There is also a hairdressing        
salon for men and women. Next door to  
this,there is a Hard-wear store which  
sells pet-food, vegetables,tools,      
children's toys and ornaments.
