		<title>07Entertainment in Eversley</title>
		<content>    Eversley has a population of about 
 1,5OO and we have no facilities for   
 entertainment,so the village makes its
 own.In 1976 Mrs.Ivy Smith decided to  
 form a choir to entertain local       
 people.They are called{The Kingsley   
{Song Byrds.}Mrs. Smith is the         
 conductor of the choir which is made  
 up of local ladies. There are         
 twenty-three members at the moment.   
 They have performed at eighty-five    
 concerts,rehearsing once a week at the
 Church Room. At their concerts they   
 sing about twelve songs which they try
 to vary.Mrs.Smith organises the choir 
 ordering the music and arranging the  
 programme for their performances. The 
 choir have sung in many places in the 
 area, including Camberley, Hartley    
 Wintney and Yateley.
