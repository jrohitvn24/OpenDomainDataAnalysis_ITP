		<content> There has always been a main road     
 between Bristol and Exeter.  In the   
 summer it is very busy so in the l950s
 they built a diversion called the     
 White Ball diversion.Now people use   
 the new motorway because it is quicker
 than going by the A38.  The A38 is    
 quieter now.  The motorway was first  
 opened in l979.  A great deal of      
 traffic went on the motorway.  We     
 timed the M5 for 20 minutes to see how
 many went under the bridge (in our    
 block), and this test was done on the 
 A38 as well.  Going northwards on the 
 M5 191 cars went past, 1 motorbike, 48
 lorries, 24 vans, 3 buses and 6       
 caravans.  Going southwards 194 cars  
 went past, 2 motorbikes, 49 lorries,  
 15 vans, 6 caravans and 5 buses. On   
 the A38 going both ways in 20 mins.   
 were 74 cars, 5 motorbikes, 30        
 lorries,9 vans 1 caravan and 1 bike.  </content>
