		<content>    The windmill, a post mill, appears 
 on a map of about 1600,  about 100m   
 away from its present position. It was
 probably moved when it was first      
 rebuilt in 1759. The repairs cost     
 about Â£200 and the Dearman family were
 the tenant farmers and millers then.  
    The second rebuild was undertaken  
 by Mr. R.F. Collinson, who owns the   
 land on which the windmill stands.    
 Using his experience in engineering,  
 he produced all the drawings and      
 helped to supervise the work. The     
 repairs were carried out in 1959/60,  
 two hundred years after the first     
 rebuild, and the cost this time was in
 the region of Â£9000.                  
    The main post is 25 inches (64cm)  
 square and is nearly 23 feet (7m)     
 high. C.J. Smith of Abridge carried   
 out the work, using experience they   
 had from renovating old churches.     </content>
