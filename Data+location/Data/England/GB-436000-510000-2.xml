		<title>02LOW WORSALL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Low Worsall was recorded in the       
 original Domesday Book as Worfal. Over
 the centuries it changed very little  
 until pre 1939-45 war,when a water    
 supply,other than wells,was installed 
 and electricity came after the        
 war.Originally the village was        
 situated around the village           
 green.Post-war building of residential
 houses developed south of the village 
 on either side of the access          
 road,leading to the village green. At 
 one time the village green had a      
 paddock and served the community as   
 common ground. At present the green of
 Low Worsall is used purely for social 
 purposes such as Bonfire night parties
 and sports days for the village       
 children.
