		<title>03ETHERLEY &amp; ESCOMB VILLAGES</title>
		<content> The people of both villages stressed  
 the friendly atmosphere and the rural 
 aspects were highly valued.           
    In Etherley concern was expressed  
 about the amount of traffic through   
 the village, the digging upof the Rail
 Trail and the low flying aircraft from
 bases in North Yorkshire.  The local  
 cricket ground is popular but there is
 a strong desire for improved bus      
 services and more local shops.        
    In Escomb most residents have lived
 here for forty to sixty years, but    
 there are young families.  More houses
 have been built over the last forty   
 years but some said that the          
 rebuilding has spoilt the character of
 the village and its community feeling.
 High rents and lack of local shops    
 cause concern.  The Saxon Church      
 attracts many visitors and Church     
 events are keenly supported.          </content>
