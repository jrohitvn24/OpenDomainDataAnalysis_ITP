		<title>06WEMBLEY FEVER 1985</title>
		<content>  The match was played on May 4th 1985.
 I was travelling down to{Wembley}to   
 watch it with my older brother Colin  
 and my dad. I had been looking forward
 to it for weeks. I was also looking   
 forward to the train journey because I
 had never been so far by train. The   
 kick off was 3 o'clock. We had arrived
 in plenty of time. Before the big     
 match there was a schoolboy game which
 I enjoyed. Then a representative of   
 all the past finals came onto the     
 pitch.We all cheered for Billy Boston.
  In the first half Henderson Gill and 
 David Stephenson both scored goal     
 kicks. In the second half Shaun       
 Edwards, John Ferguson and Brett Kenny
 all scored tries. The final score was 
{28-24}to{Wigan.}It was a very exciting
 match. Both teams and spectators were 
 very sporting. When we got home there 
 was hot-pot for supper. (Gary Lewis)  </content>
