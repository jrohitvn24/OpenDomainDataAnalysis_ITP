		<title>07ERITH DEEP WHARF</title>
		<content>   The paper stored at Erith Deep Wharf
 Storage Depot comes from Finland. Pine
 trees are cut down and pulled by      
 tractor to the lake. They are tied    
 together like a huge raft.            
   When they arrive at one of the ten  
 to twelve paper mills that are        
 scattered all over Finland they are   
 made into paper pulp. Chalk and bleach
 are added. The paper is dried and cut 
 to correct lengths, then bundled off  
 to Rauma, the port where they begin   
 their journey by ship. It comes to    
 Erith once a week carrying 4,000 tons 
 of paper.                             
   At Erith the reels are transported  
 by a moveable crane into the storage  
 depot. There they stay until needed by
 a national magazine or newspaper. The 
 paper is moved by hydraulic truck.    
 Paper is transported by truck to Fleet
 Street.                               </content>
