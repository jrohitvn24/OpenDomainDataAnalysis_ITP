		<title>06Concern About Traffic</title>
		<content>   Concern was shown about the state of
 disrepair of roads in East Grinstead. 
 More traffic lights, pedestrian &amp;     
 school crossings, footbridges, cycle  
 paths and one way systems, as well as 
 new priorities at roundabouts and     
 improved junctions were thought       
 necessary.People were also worried    
 about lorries, and the inability of   
 both the road system and the new by   
 pass to cope with problems which      
 arise. The idea of a more effective   
 road system to completely by pass the 
 town was popular whilst views about   
 widening the pavement and narrowing   
 of London Road were also  added to    
 the questionaire by a very large      
 proportion of the parents indicating  
 widespread concern for both drivers   
 and pedestrians, particularly, the    
 elderly in winter.
