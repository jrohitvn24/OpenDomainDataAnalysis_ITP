		<title>15The Eling Parish Priest</title>
		<content> Four children went to see the Vicar of
 Eling. They asked him lots of         
 questions. They found out that he     
 didn't like sports much, he spent a   
 lot of time studying and reading. He  
 has about 20 funerals a month. He gets
 up at about 7 on Sunday morning and   
 after the service he goes home for a  
 cup of tea.                           
{St. Mary's Church}: We were told that 
 when the water pipes were fitted they 
 found a Roman coin. This may mean that
 there was a building there in Roman   
 times. There has been a church on the 
 spot for 2000 years. We saw the Altar 
 and a picture of the Last Supper which
 was about 300 years old. There was a  
 stained glass window made by William  
 Morris.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
