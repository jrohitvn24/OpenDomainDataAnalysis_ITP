		<title>03Farming around Cliffe</title>
		<content>      The main farming around Cliffe is
 growing{cereals.}Over half of the     
 fields are being used for barley, with
 some winter wheat and oats. Most of   
 the barley is grown for malting.      
      In the survey we counted five    
 fields of sugar beet, five fields of  
 oil seed rape, four fields of         
 potatoes, and one field of beans.     
                                       
      There are two{pig farms}in the   
 area, one just west of Cliffe, and one
 on Cliffe Common. There are two{dairy 
{farms,}Wood End Farm, and Nevilthorne,
 both with herds of Friesians.         
                                       
      There are two{market gardens}in  
 the area, growing mainly lettuce, and 
 tomatoes in greenhouses. Old people   
 can remember when there was a lot more
 market gardening, and the plants went 
 on the railway to Leeds or Hull.      </content>
