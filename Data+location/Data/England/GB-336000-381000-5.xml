		<title>05EASTHAM LOCKS.</title>
		<content> Eastham Locks was built in May 1891.  
 Manchester ship canal starts by       
 Eastham Locks.The canal has to have   
 tidal locks and there are some at     
 Eastham.They have to be open at high  
 water so that they will hold all the  
 water that comes in.At Eastham the    
 canal begins with,first the dredged   
 canal and the entrance look to the    
 Queen Elizabeth II dock on the right  
 and the Eastham Locks ahead.The       
 Manchester ship canal was opened in   
 1894 so Eastham locks was probably    
 opened then too.The main forms of {   
{transport }along the canal are small  
 oil and gas tankers,small container   
 ships,barges and tugs.
