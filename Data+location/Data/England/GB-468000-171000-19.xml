		<content>{INDUSTRY}Brickmaking was carried out  
 for centuries,the clay being dug from 
 the hills above the River Kennet.     
 "TILEHURST".Three brick kilns existed 
 at Coley/Katesgrove and Tilehurst they
 specialised in the production of      
 terracotta bricks many of which can be
 seen in local victorian buildings.The 
 last working kiln was demolished      
 in 1970.A kiln and chimney still      
 stands off Honey End Lane as a        
 monument to this industry.{TRANSPORT.}
 During the 18th century the river     
 kennet was the main transport link    
 between Reading and Newbury.A canal   
 was added and opened in 1723,but the  
 prosperity of the waterway ceased with
 the opening of the Railway networks   
 throughout the 19th century.{READING  
{ABBEY,}built 1121 was demolished by   
 Henry V111 and is now ruined.
