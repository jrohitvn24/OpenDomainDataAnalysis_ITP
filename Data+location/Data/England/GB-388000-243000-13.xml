		<content> There is very little employment in the
 area itself. Most people work outside 
 in{Worcester, Pershore, Evesham}or    
 even{Birmingham.}Those that work      
 within the area do so mainly at home  
 (housewives etc.). The main D block   
 employers are{Midland Shire Farmers   
{Depot,}providing farm supplies.       
{R.S.R.E.}employs{100}people but none  
 are local. The{Primary school}at      
{Defford}employs a few local people as 
 does the{Special school}at{Besford}but
 many of the staff also live on the    
 premises. Local farmers employ a      
 number of people but some of this work
 is seasonal. Once it is in full       
 operation it is hoped that the        
{Conference Centre and Restaurant}at   
{Crome Court}will increase employment  
 opportunities in the area.
