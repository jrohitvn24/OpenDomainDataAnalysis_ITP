		<title>15Wilf Bottomley (stone mason)</title>
		<content>{Mr Bottomley}was working on the       
 extension of the shop at the museum.  
 Although he is now retired,he was     
 shaping stone sills and lintels for   
 the windows.Two young men were roofing
 the extension,under his eye,with grey 
 slate,the local stone used for        
 roofs.These are thinner than the flags
 used for floors and as he said,       
 "There's nothing like stone for       
 building".                            
    He was proud that the new building 
 was in keeping with the traditional   
 character of the town.A new housing   
 estate built in Yorkshire stone had   
 won an architectural award recently.  
    He started work in a woollen mill  
 at 14 but soon became apprenticed to a
 stone mason.He has worked on churches 
 and other buildings all over the area 
 and{"makes nowt"}of modern materials  
 which don't last two minutes.         </content>
