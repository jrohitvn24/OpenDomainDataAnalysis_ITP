   On 18th May 1985 a local family had 
 a garden bazaar in Broadoak Avenue,   
 Enfield. The bazaar was in aid of the 
 National Kidney Association which     
 raises money to  buy kidney machines  
 for people with kidney problems.Two   
 children raised Â£289.89 at the        
 Bazaar,they had about 200 people.The  
 Bazaar opened at 11 am.The stalls     
 were:toys,books,5p stall,cakes,clothes
 and refreshments.The Bazaar was       
 organised by two children aged 11 and 
 15.They have had a bazaar for past 6  
 years and nearly Â£1000 has been       
 raised.They hope to organise another  
 bazaar in 1986 and expect to raise    
 more money for Kidney Machines.
