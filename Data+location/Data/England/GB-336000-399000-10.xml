		<content>    Most industry in the area is light.
 There are three industrial areas in   
 this block.  In Melling the main      
 industry is connected with timber,    
 there being three large timber yards  
 in the Waddicar district.             
 There is also the BICC factory which  
 makes cables and wires and other      
 electrical components which are       
 exported all over the world.  In      
 Netherton there is Northwest Holst    
 which deals with construction of      
 bridges, roads and motorways.         
 On Maghull's Sefton Trading Estate    
 there are lots of small light         
 industriues which vary from shrimp    
 packing to joinery, plastic packaging 
 and double glazing.  Most people      
 travel to work by car or train, only a
 few work within the area.  The work   
 force is mainly highly skilled or     
 professional; only small %age manual. </content>
