		<title>03DUNKERTON LIFE</title>
		<content> In the main the people of Dunkerton go
 outside the village for recreational  
 activies. The former primary school is
 however used as a village hall for    
 various activities such as bingo      
 evenings. There is a branch of the    
 Womens Institute and the village has a
 thriving cricket club with a team     
 playing regularly on a well tended    
 pitch. The Church of England parish   
 church is not very active and does not
 play a major part in village life. The
 parish shares a vicar with the        
 neighbouring parishes of Camerton and 
 Shoscombe. A service is held each     
 Sunday but the congregation is only   
 around six. The nearby hamlet of      
 Withyditch has a Baptist chapel which 
 is rather more active, but Withyditch 
 is a separate community with little   
 involvement in Dunkerton.
