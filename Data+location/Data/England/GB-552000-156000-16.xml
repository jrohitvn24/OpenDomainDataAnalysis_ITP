		<content>Housing can be divided into three main 
categories in three distinct areas,    
linked by "ribbon development" dating  
from the 1920s to the present day.     
The village of Seal has a mixture of   
very old and more recent dwellings     
occupied largely by people who commute 
or people who work locally as skilled  
craftsmen or in agricultural trades.   
Around the Greatness area -historically
very important in the growth of        
Sevenoaks- there is a pattern of       
pre-war and post-war terraces, the     
former to house workers in the nearby  
brick and sandworks, and the latter to 
house workers on the Vestry Industrial 
Estate of the 1950s and 1960s.         
Around the Wildernesse area there are  
many large houses in their own grounds 
whose owners mostly commute to London. 
A feature of the area is the closeness 
of council and private housing.        </content>
