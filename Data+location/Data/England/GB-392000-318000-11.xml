		<title>11Transport in Stafford.</title>
		<content>  The Mini Bus Service in Stafford     
started on 10th May 1985, mainly to    
service the community better,          
especially the old.  It was hoped that 
people would be more ready to use the  
buses if they came to their doorstep.  
The colours, red and yellow were chosen
because they are colours people would  
not fail to notice.                    
  The fare at present for travelling   
from Wildwood into Stafford is 40p     
return for children and 75p for adults.
O.A.P.'s have a reduced rate.  Although
there are 9 Mini Buses, only 8 are on  
service, 1 in reserve.  Mini Buses     
can go down small streets which the    
bigger buses cannot.  They cost 13000  
pounds each and seat 16 people and 5   
standing.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
