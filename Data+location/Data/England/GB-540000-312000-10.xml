		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JAMES</title>
		<content> After a breakfast of cereals, I either
 cycle to{school}or my mother takes me 
 in the car. When I arrive in the      
{playground}I usually play "circle     
 circle" with my friends. In this game,
 there are two semi_circles; one person
 is named to be "it" and the idea is to
 run from one area to the other with   
 out being caught. In the morning in   
 our classroom we mainly do writing and
 mathematics. Breaktime is at 10_30    
 a.m. and we have dinner at 12 noon. In
 the afternoons we often work on       
 projects although some days we watch  
 television, have swimming, do         
 athletics or rounders. After school,  
 I usually have a game of snooker with 
 my younger brother. Sometimes I play  
 cricket with my friends.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
