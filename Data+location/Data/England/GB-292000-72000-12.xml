		<title>12TOURIST QUESTIONNAIRE 1.</title>
		<content> These are the results of a survey of  
 100 tourists taken in July 1985.      
   We found that 48% of the people who 
 visited Teignmouth were of retirement 
 age; 70% of the people had visited    
 Teignmouth once before and 32% had    
 travelled by public transport. Only   
 12% of those staying in Teignmouth had
 travelled 200 miles or more to come   
 here. 23% were staying in rented      
 accommodation, 20% were in hotels, 17%
 were camping and 12% were staying in  
 bed and breakfast accommodation. Only 
 nine out of the hundred felt that     
 their welcome had not been friendly   
 and 94% said that they would come back
 again on another occasion.            
   For 87% the facilities were adequate
 and in particular they liked the      
 weather, the beach, the scenery, the  
 quietness and the cleanness.
