		<title>11Communications: Television</title>
		<content>{Communications} can be between        
individual people or for the masses.   
{Television} is normally used for the  
mass comunication of information,      
ideas, advertising and entertainment.  
Most homes will have a {television set}
which displays moving coloured pictures
from anywhere in the world. A special  
{camera} takes the pictures which are  
then recorded, or transmitted live to  
any {T.V. receiver.} The television can
be very large, mounted on the wall of a
hall, or small enough to be carried    
around. The coloured pictures are made 
up of over a million dots of three     
colours which blend together to form   
the final picture. {Closed circuit     
television} can be used in shops to    
spot thieves, or for private           
educational and training programmes.
