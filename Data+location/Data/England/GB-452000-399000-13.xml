		<content>{Religion}is how people worship God    
 according to their religious beliefs. 
 All Churchmen except the Full Gospel  
{clergy}have special robes for church. 
 There are two Church of England, one  
 Catholic Church, one Methodist and one
 Full Gospel in the area. All the      
 Churches celebrate Holy Communion and 
 the main Christian festivals of       
 Christmas, Easter etc., when Church   
 becomes more popular. Every Church    
 gives baptism, weddings and funeral   
 services. Sunday is the main day for  
 services including special services   
 for children. However, weekday        
 services and home services for the    
 sick and elderly are also given. All  
 except Pastor Thomas (Full Gospel)    
 have attended theological college     
 before being ordained. All the        
 churches in use have been built in the
 last century.                         </content>
