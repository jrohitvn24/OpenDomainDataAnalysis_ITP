		<title>13The Canal Locks</title>
		<content>   The lock on the river Ure in        
 Boroughbridge was built in 1942.The   
 river splits up at the locks, one way 
 goes past the bridge and the other    
 goes past the lock and they meet again
 after the waterfalls.The river Ure    
 leads from Boroughbridge to Ripon     
 and from Ripon it leads down to the   
 river Ouse that runs through York.    
    The wood of the locks is getting   
  old but it will last for a few years 
 yet .The locks are very well equiped  
 with fish so its good for fishing.The 
 boats can go to York from the lock and
 Ripon or just round Boroughbridge.The 
 lock is controlled by a handle which  
 you turn round to open the gates to   
 let the water into the locks.The canal
 was built in 1767 and it is still used
 today.
