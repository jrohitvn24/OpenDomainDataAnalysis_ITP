		<title>17BIRTHDAY PARTIES</title>
		<content> We have many{celebrations}during the  
 year - christenings, weddings,        
 Christmas parties and birthday        
 parties. At a{child's birthday party} 
 the child's friends usually come      
 together at his home. The{guests}     
 arrive with presents wrapped in       
 decorated paper. They play{games}such 
 as 'musical chairs', 'musical bumps', 
 'musical statues' or 'dead lions. The 
 music is played on record or cassette 
 player. After the games and dancing   
 they sit down at a table to eat{food} 
 such as sandwiches, sausage rolls and 
 crisps, followed by something such as 
 ice cream and jelly. Then comes the{  
{birthday cake}decorated with icing    
 sugar or cream and lighted candles -  
 one for each year of the birthday     
 person's age and he has to try to blow
 out all the candles at one attempt.
