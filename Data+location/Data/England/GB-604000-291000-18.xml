		<content> Robert Cocks of Notting Hill, in the  
 time of Thomas Fulcher (who was vicar 
 for 64 years), gave the school house  
 and the alms houses on the edge of the
 green to the village.  There is a     
 plaque in the school house which says:
                                       
 "Glory to God - Mr Robert Cocks of    
 Notting Hill, London, in presenting   
 his generous gift to the parish of Old
 Buckenham of this schoolroom....thus  
 expressed himself:-                   
                                       
 It is my desire and prayer that this  
 school house shall be for all time a  
 nursery where children may be taught  
 on Protestant principles their duty to
 God and man.                          
                                       
 Deed of Gift - December 21st 1883"
