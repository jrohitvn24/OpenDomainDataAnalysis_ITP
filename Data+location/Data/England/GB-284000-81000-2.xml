		<title>02Trusham Village  _1_</title>
		<content> The population of this small village  
 is about 170 and made up of a mixture 
 of families who have lived there for  
 generations and newcomers who commute 
 to work in nearby towns.  Whilst many 
 amenities such as the school and post 
 office have disappeared in recent     
 years, a Devon longhouse was converted
 into a pub about three years ago.     
 Children are bussed to school in      
 nearby Chudleigh or Chudleigh Knighton
 and the parish church has a visiting  
 Church of England vicar from nearby   
 Christow who provide services for four
 parishes in the area. The actively    
 supported village hall was bought four
 years ago from the church and is      
 administered by an annually elected   
 committee,who organise six to eight   
 major events during the year and one  
 or two events each week in winter.
