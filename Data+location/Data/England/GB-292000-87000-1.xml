		<content> The area lies on the estuary of the   
 River Exe to the south of the City of 
 Exeter.  Approximately half of the    
 land is gently rolling farmland.  The 
 estuary of the river and its          
 associated flat, flood plain land     
 accounts for much of the rest.  The   
 main settlements are the village of   
 Exminster and a residential area known
 as Countess Wear which is a suburb of 
 Exeter.  Through traffic is mainly    
 diverted to the south of the city and 
 trunk roads including the M5 motorway 
 are the main feature of this area.    
                                       
 Additional features include a canal,  
 sewage works, Exminster Hospital, part
 of Exeter golf course, playing fields,
 caravan site and Naval Supply Depot.
