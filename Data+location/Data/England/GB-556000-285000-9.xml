		<title>09A RIVERSIDE PUB, LITTLEPORT</title>
		<content> We know that the pub goes back at     
 least to the 1800s but probably much  
 further.It was called the{Black Horse 
 because horses, which pulled the      
{barges}and{lighters}along the River   
 Ouse between Bedford, Cambridge and   
 the port at Kings Lynn, were kept     
 there.                                
 One man has been daily to the pub for 
 24 years. The present owner took over 
 the pub 9 years ago.He said that if he
 didn't own the pub he go back to the  
 building trade. When he retires he    
 would rather a stranger took over the 
 pub.                                  
 The pub has been modernised recently, 
 a{restaurant}added and tables set next
 to a quay. When the{fishing}season is 
 good there are a lot of customers,    
 including foreign customers such as   
 Germans, Italians, French, Americans, 
 Greeks, Danish etc.                   </content>
