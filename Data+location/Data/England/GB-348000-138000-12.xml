		<title>12The Zodiac and Glastonbury</title>
		<content> Many tourists come to Glastonbury to  
 experience the feelings associated    
 with the place. These feelings, called
 "vibes" in modern parlance, arise from
 mystical and spiritual associations of
 the place. Apart from legends of early
 Christians, more recently mystics have
 discovered that{Druids}possibly made  
 use of the area, and about 2700 B.C.  
 ancient astronomer priests are        
 believed to have laid out a twelve    
 sign zodiac with all the normal       
 constellations physically mapped out  
 on the ground in the correct sequence 
 within a ten mile radius of the town. 
 Those believing in this pattern of the
 zodiac's existence say it can best be 
 seen from the air,and many aerial maps
 show Pisces the fish, representing    
{Wearyall Hill,}and the{Tor}as part of 
 the Aquarius outline. But sceptics    
 dismiss all this as rubbish.          </content>
