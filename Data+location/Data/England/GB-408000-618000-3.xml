 Northumberland for the aubretia which 
 decorates the stone walls,also for the
 large topiary bird at The Hall's Lodge
  There are two bus routes which pass  
 through the region.Their routes are   
 marked on the survey grid on each     
 square through which the buses travel.
 One is a service bus, passing through 
 the area three times a day in each    
 direction. It is used by school pupils
 or people shopping in Alnwick and     
 Wooler.The other is a school bus and  
 travels from Wooler to Alnwick at     
 about half past eight in the morning, 
 returning after the schools' end each 
 evening.Occasionally a double-decker  
 is used or a yellow bus.Most of the   
 buses are red.
