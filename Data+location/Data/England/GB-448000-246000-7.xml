		<content>The main road going through Chipping   
Warden is the A361 which starts in     
Daventry and goes all the way down to  
Ilracombe in Devon. Quite a lot of     
lorries go through or to Chipping      
Warden because there is an industrial  
estate along Appletree Road. It is     
called Appletree Road because it goes  
to a place called Appletree. At this   
Industrial estate there are three      
companies, Lowfield, E.P.S. and House  
of Holland. Some farm vehicles go      
through Chipping Warden because there  
are several farms nearby. In the middle
of the village there used to be an elm 
tree. The A361 was built round this    
tree and is now a dangerous bend. There
have been many accidents on this bend. 
The tree died,was cut down but the bend
in the road is still there. Perhaps a  
by-pass will be built to stop this busy
road from spoiling our lovely village. </content>
