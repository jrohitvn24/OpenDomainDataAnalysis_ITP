		<content> This area is largely uninhabited but  
 does contain features of interest.    
 The Ministry of Defence has a major   
 installation in this area.  This      
 installation is known as the Admiralty
 Research Establishment (A.R.E.) and is
 involved with submarine technology and
 torpedo design and research.  Over    
 1500 people are employed at this      
 establishment but many of them live in
 Weymouth and travel daily to work     
 across the causeway.  Also in the area
 are fields farmed by inmates of the   
 Youth Custody Centre, formerly known  
 as H.M.Borstal.  The land they work   
 includes terraces which were part of  
 an ancient field system.  The eastern 
 section of the square includes        
 interesting cliffs, caves, wave cut   
 platforms and a blow hole.  The       
 platforms are used by anglers,        
 sunbathers and, on occasions, seals.  </content>
