		<content>Girls like to play with "My Little     
Pony" toys.They have different names,  
lke Apple Jack and Cotton Candy        
according to the patterns on them.At   
Bentley School children make dens round
the tree roots and the boys make       
roadways round them for their toy cars.
Other popular games are                
Hopscotch,marbles and conkers in       
season.Boys also play Football.        
One of the popular games at Capel      
School is 40-40.Somebody is "it" and   
the others hide.The first person caught
is "it" next time.You can "save        
yourself"by getting to the base without
being caught.
