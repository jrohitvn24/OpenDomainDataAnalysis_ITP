		<content>  Marchants bus company (owned and run 
 by Roy Marchant; mayor of Cheltenham  
 1983) offers a much cheaper service   
 than the National bus company.        
 Marchants buses are always full;      
 standing room only on saturdays!      
     Public transport does, however,   
 create problems for the young and for 
 those who are not car owners. Stoke   
 Orchard is only served by the more    
 expensive National bus company and the
 last Marchants bus from Cheltenham    
 leaves at 10.15 p.m. This is          
 considered too early for those who    
 wish to visit a cinema, a theatre, or 
 a local discotheque.                  
     Although the main line railway    
 from Bristol to Birmingham runs       
 through the area, there are no railway
 stations. The nearest railway station 
 is in Cheltenham.
