		<title>07ECOLOGY IN BURNHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    Burnham Market is designated an    
 Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and
 is on the edge of the Heritage        
 Coastline. The{climate}is drier than  
 that in many other parts of the       
 country (though this is hard to       
 believe in such a wet year as 1985).  
 Chill North and East winds blow across
 the county from the North Sea - it is 
 said that "The Norfolk wind is lazy:  
 it blows through you instead of round 
 you!"                                 
    Local farms have a wide selection  
 of{wildlife}- pigeons, rabbits,       
 pipistrelle bats and toads. Bats are a
 protected species, but the others are 
 considered by farmers to be pests.    
    There are well-maintained{footpaths
 and bridle paths over much of this    
 area, though one is under dispute at  
 present.
