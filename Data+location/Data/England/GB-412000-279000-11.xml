		<title>11Annual Junior School Camp</title>
		<content> Sometimes Junior school children go on
 school trips. Ours was a 5 day camping
 trip to Wales. We gained a lot from   
 the experience of having to look after
 ourselves in tents in a field.        
 Conditions were very difficult but we 
 managed. It rained heavily each night 
 creating thick mud everywhere. The    
 trip to the toilet became an          
 expedition. We had to change our wet  
 clothes often and found beetles in our
 sleeping bags. We shared the daily    
 chores, tidying, washing up after     
 breakfast, making sandwiches for lunch
 and tightening the guy ropes on our   
 tents. Our trips out included a ride  
 on the cable tram to Aberystwyth      
 Camera Obscura, a bout trip to see the
 guillemots but, most important of all,
 a walk round the shops to buy presents
 for our parents and spend all our     
 money.                                </content>
