		<content> The reservoir at Codnor Park, built   
 originally to top up the canal, has   
 been altered because of the Parliament
 Safety Rules.The alterations to the   
 reservoir altogether{cost 420,000     
 pounds.They have lowered the water to 
 5m at the deepest point and 1m in the 
 shallow point.They have built two     
 weirs to keep the water the right     
 level if there is a big storm.There is
 a bridge across the two weirs.There is
 concrete lining at the bottom and     
 sides of the weir to stop the banks   
 from getting washed away.In the worst 
 possible storm the water would rise a 
 metre above the weirs and the water   
 would be half a metre deep in the     
 canal.There will be two picnic areas  
 next to the weirs.In the picnic areas 
 there will be benches,trees and grass 
 which the council will provide.It will
 all be finished in{September 1985.    </content>
