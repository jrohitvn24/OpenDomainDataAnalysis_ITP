		<title>11Addenbrooke's Hospital</title>
		<content>    Addenbrookes is a large and famous 
 hospital with many doctors and nurses.
 It is always busy as it has a casualty
 department where people who have hurt 
 themselves can come and be treated.   
 The emergency patients are always     
 treated first,so if you have just cut 
 yourself badly with a knife,you may   
 have to wait several hours before you 
 are attended to. This hospital has    
 been open since 1978. The machinery   
 and X-ray systems are very sophisti-  
 cated. All the staff are friendly and 
 helpful but some of them have to work 
 very long hours,particularly the      
 junior doctors.                       
    There is a special ward where chil-
 dren are looked after when they have  
 liver transplants. It is named after  
 Ben Hardwick,the first child to have  
 this operation at Addenbrookes. He    
 was only 2 years old at the time.     </content>
