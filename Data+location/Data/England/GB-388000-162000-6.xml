		<content>   St.Michael's Church in the middle of
 town is about 800 years old.  The     
 oldest gravestone is 230 years old.   
 The first vicar of the church was a   
 man called Romoldus, who was vicar in 
 the 11th century.  In the church there
 are many old bibles, the oldest being 
 about 100 years old.  In the graveyard
 there are some graves with a fence    
 around them, belonging to wealthy     
 people.  Altogether there are         
 thousands of graves, but we do not    
 know exactly.  At the front of the    
 church there is a yew tree, which has 
 been there for 500 years.  In 1840 the
 tower was moved to the east end of the
 church.  The average number of people 
 in church on a Sunday is 140.         
 Mr.Fisher, the present vicar, likes   
 being a vicar because he likes working
 within other people.
