		<content> In 1834 Sir Henry Tufton Endowed      
 Hothfield with a school for boys  &amp;   
 girls which was completed in 1839 &amp;   
 opened in 1840. The building no       
 longer being adequate, a new school   
 was built in 1874 alongside; the old  
 school was then used as a residence   
 for heads or staff at a nominal rent. 
 In 1974 the rent was Â£60.00 pa. The   
 classrooms &amp; above rooms on each side 
 of the main house were separated &amp;    
 sold. The main house was sold in 1975.
 Numbers on roll at the school were 40 
 in 1840 rising to 140 recently &amp; has  
 now dropped to 60. Westwell school is 
 no longer used &amp; has been sold.
