		<content>East Hagbourne is quite a large village
which is based on farming. In the      
centre are old buildings, one of which 
has been turned into a public house and
off license (Fleur de Lys). Also in the
centre of the village is a small       
primary school with a heated indoor    
swimming pool. Most children at the    
school come from the village, Didcot   
and surrounding villages.              
In 1984 the village held raffles and   
jumble sales to raise money for the    
restoration of the church's bellcote.  
Restoration, started early in 1985, was
completed in June.                     
East Hagbourne has a village fete every
year and there is also a pumpkin party 
at the Spread Eagle Pub.               
In the summer when extra labour is     
needed on the farms, children on       
holiday can be seen helping with the   
harvest.                               </content>
