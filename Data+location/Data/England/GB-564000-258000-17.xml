		<title>17Pubs Around Stetchworth</title>
		<content>  The Stetchworth pub is The Marquis of
 Granby, a Greene King house. It has   
 one bar and serves bar snacks and     
 meals at weekends. It also has a      
 garden. It is known in the village as 
 the "top pub". This expression dates  
 from the time when people had to      
 distinquish it from the other two     
 village pubs which are now closed. One
 is now a private house with stables   
 and the other is a guest house.       
 Stetchworth also has a Royal British  
 Legion club.                          
  In Woodditton, the pub is the Three  
 Blackbirds. It is a Tolly Cobbold     
 house, and has a restaurant with a    
 good reputation locally.              
  Saxon Street's pub is The Reindeer.  
 It too is a Tolly Cobbold house. It   
 serves bar snacks and has two bars. It
 has recently reopened after having    
 been closed down for a while.         </content>
