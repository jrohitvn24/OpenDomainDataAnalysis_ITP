		<content> The A.R.C. dig fields and extract     
 gravel fom underneath.  The gravel is 
 flint from millions of years ago.  The
 gravel is seperated into different    
 sizes.                                
 The company gets the landowners       
 permission to work on that bit of     
 land.  At first they drill a hole to  
 see if the gravel is the right sort.  
 If it is they drain all the water from
 underneath the field and then dig up  
 the whole field and get the gravel    
 out.  After they've got it all out    
 they either put the field back like it
 was or make it into a lake.           
 It is estimated that in 2010 AD ll the
 gravel from this area will have run   
 out.  While they extract gravel wild  
 animals lose their homes, but fish    
 stocks are introduced into the lakes.
