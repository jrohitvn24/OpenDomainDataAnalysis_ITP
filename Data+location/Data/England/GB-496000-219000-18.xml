		<content>  Known locally as "The Rec", it is in 
 the middle of the village, by the     
 sharp bend in the road.  There is a   
 large open space in the middle.  At   
 one side there are swings and a slide 
 for the children to play on.  At the  
 other side is the new football club   
 pavilion.  Besides week-end matches,  
 they play on Mondays and Thursdays.   
 The pavilion is also a club house and 
 community centre.  It has its own bar 
 and organises fund-raising and social 
 events.  There is a Bonfire party each
 5th November, which is run jointly by 
 the football club and the school's    
 Parents' Association.  Several local  
 groups use the pavilion as their      
 meeting place.  One such group is the 
 "Young At Heart Club" for Senior      
 Citizens.  They meet on Wednesday     
 afternoons and organize events for    
 their members.                        </content>
