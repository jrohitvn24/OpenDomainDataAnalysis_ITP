 Strensall.  It trains new adult       
 recruits and Territorial Army         
 personnel.                            
 Facilities include 2 Football pitches,
 1 Rugby pitch, 1 grass Hockey pitch, a
 Gymnasium and an Assault Course.  The 
{families}of the soldiers have access  
 to these facilities and some village  
 football teams are allowed to practise
 there.  The{children}living in the    
 married quarters next to the camp use 
 the playing fields, the common (when  
 the{red warning flag}is not flying)   
 and the play parks.  There is a NAAFI 
 shop for general purchases.  The      
 different ranks have their own messes.
 Most of the houses are quite new and  
 some were only completed in 1984. A   
 few families live in private houses,  
 sometimes owned by the M.O.D.         
 The children attend Strensall school. </content>
