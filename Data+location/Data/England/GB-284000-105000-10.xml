		<content> The milking cows are British          
 Friesians. When they are young their  
 horns have to be cut off to stop them 
 fighting each other. The cows can     
 catch diseases such as mastitis and   
 ring worm. Recently 38 cows had to be 
 sold as the farm was producing more   
 milk than its quota allowed by the    
 EEC. There is one Hereford bull on the
 farm. The calves fathered by the bull 
 are fattened for two years and then   
 slaughtered for{meat.}Some of the meat
 is sold direct to local people.The    
 rest of the cows receive artificial   
 insemination and their cow calves are 
 kept for milking. The cattle are fed  
 on{grass, silage,}sugar beet, cow cake
 and barley. Nearly all the fields are 
 used for grass and silage. A few acres
 are used for barley which is stored   
 for winter feed.
