		<content> School starts at 8.50a.m., too early  
 for some! There are over 1000 children
 aged 11 to 16 years in the school.    
 Most of the children like the school  
 uniform which they are required to    
 wear. Over l4 different subjects are  
 taught, with examinations each year,  
 C.S.E. &amp; G.C.E. for 5th years.        
 Favourite subjects are Art and P.E.   
 The Headteacher would like more sports
 equipment, musical instruments and    
 computers. The children want a tuck   
 shop, swimming pool and longer        
 afternoon breaks.
