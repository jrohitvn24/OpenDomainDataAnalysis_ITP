		<title>15Energy In Norton Area.</title>
		<content>   In our area everybody uses          
 electricity.  You can use it for      
 cookers, fridges, freezers, washing   
 machines, tumble driers, hi_fis,      
 radios, televisions, lights, some     
 toys, computers and video games, lawn 
 mowers, drills, hedge                 
 trimmers,welders, grinders and some   
 fires.                                
   When there is a power cut other     
 means of energy are candles, paraffin 
 lights and Calor gas heaters.         
   In our area there are lots of pylons
 because we are near Buildwas Power    
 Station.                              
   Some people have meters in their    
 homes and the meter is read every     
 quarter of the year.  Other people    
 have 50p slot meters, in which they   
 have to keep putting 50p.  Either way 
 it gives electricity which has to be  
 paid for.                             </content>
