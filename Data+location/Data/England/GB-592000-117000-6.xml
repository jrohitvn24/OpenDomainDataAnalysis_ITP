		<content>    Nearly{300 species}of flowering    
 plants have been recorded on the      
 Reserve. Parts of the reserve are     
 shingle where sea pea covers the      
 ground with pink flowers and the      
 Yellow-horned poppy is plentiful.     
 Plants have had to adapt to bleak     
 conditions and salty ground. The      
 large cabbage_like sea kale is one    
 of the most common plants near the    
 shore.                                
    On a walk though the reserve       
 in June,children spotted such plants  
 as Jack by the hedge, Red Clover,     
 Vipers Bugloss and Valerian.          
 Many species of{aquatic flowers}can   
 be seen in the man_made gravel pits   
 that make up much of the reserve.     
 At Castle Waters {,5 types of orchid  
{grow}in the grassy areas.
