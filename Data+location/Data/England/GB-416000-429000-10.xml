		<title>10Local History in S.Bradford.</title>
		<content> South Bradford is situated on rocks   
 formed in the{Upper Carboniferous }   
 Period.These rocks are mainly         
{sandstones and shales}but between     
 these layers are seams of{coal}and    
 deposits of{ironstone.}Therefore our  
 region has a long history of mining.  
 There were at least iron pits in our  
 region providing{iron ore}for works at
 Bowling,Birkenshaw and Low Moor.Coal  
 was also mined and used at the iron   
 works.The last coal mine closed in the
 1950's,this was Toftshaw Moor         
 Colliery.As a result of many years of 
 mining the area is littered with      
 uncharted mines and before the new    
 Ryan Middle School could be built over
 1000 drillings had to be made and     
 filled with concrete to ensure there  
 were no mines under the foundations.
