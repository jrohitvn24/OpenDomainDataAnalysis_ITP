		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> The block area is predominantly farm- 
 land with two squares containing MOD  
 former World War II airfield. The 2   
 areas of settlement are Keevil (which 
 is also included in Steeple Ashton    
 block), and Bulkington. This section  
 of Keevil includes part of the village
 conservation area and contains build- 
 ing contrasts between old and new.    
 Village inhabitants commute to local  
 towns for school, work and amenities  
 eg doctor, bank, shops. A strong com- 
 munity spirit exists with clubs and   
 groups providing a focus for social   
 activity. Fortunately the constantly  
 changing population is fairly evenly  
 spread over the full age range. There 
 are no groups of ethnic minorities    
  resident in the block. The pace of   
 life is slower than in the town but no
 less hectic. There still exists a     
 pride in keeping the village unspoilt.</content>
