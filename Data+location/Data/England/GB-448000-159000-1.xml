		<title>01The Ecchinswell Area</title>
		<content>  The small village of {Ecchinswell}and
 the surrounding farmland lie on the   
 Hampshire/Berkshire border.Meadows,   
 small copses,fields of grain divided  
 by substantial hedges make up the     
 overall picture of the area. Small    
 streams run from the chalk downs in   
 the south,and up to 1852 Ecchinswell  
 was called{Itchingswell,}the name     
 referring to these wells and streams. 
  The large number of trees and bushes 
 preclude the photographer from taking 
 a general view from any standpoint.The
 main street contains no shops.{       
{St.Lawrences Church}lies at the north 
 end and {The Royal Oak}public house at
 the south,with{The Primary School}mid-
 way between.This is a village with    
 very few amenities.The two main       
 buildings of interest east of         
 Ecchinswell are{The Star Inn}and {    
{Cheam School. }                       </content>
