		<content> We went to visit the church. The vicar
 showed us round. He told us that the  
 nave of the church was{800 years}old  
 but many parts have been added. The   
 church that we see today was finished 
 in{1900.}We went up into the belfry   
 and saw one bell that was{three       
{hundred}years old. We looked up into  
 the roof and saw{imps}and{monkeys     
 carved into the roof. One of the      
 stained glass windows had a picture of
 Mary and{Joseph}on it. We looked at   
 different parts of the church. The    
 date{1614}was carved on the pulpit.   
 Near the big wooden door was a porch  
 with seats all around.
