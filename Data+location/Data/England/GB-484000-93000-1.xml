		<title>01SELSEY - INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>    Selsey was once an island but is   
 now a peninsula.It is a very flat     
 village,so flat that if we did not    
 have a sea wall and there was a high  
 tide Selsey would be partially under  
 water.Two pages contain information   
 about ecology and landscape.          
    From the 9-10,000 population we    
 have chosen to write about one day in 
 their lives,their employment and in   
 particular fishing,the Coastguard and 
 trade.Their housing,education,religion
 and a biography of Patrick Moore are  
 included.                             
    From the field of recreation we    
 have included the following:          
 sports,clubs,entertainment,events and 
 tourism.                              
    People come to Selsey to enjoy the 
 many sunshine hours and the beaches.
