		<title>03A SACRISTON GIRL'S WEEKEND</title>
		<content>    I get up at about 8:30 if I am     
 going to Durham with my mum. If not I 
 get up at about 9:15. I have my       
 breakfast; then do my homework or some
 sewing. Every other Saturday          
 afternoon, I go to a wind band where I
 play my clarinet for 2\ hours.        
 Otherwise I do the same as I did in   
 the morning. I have my tea about 5:45 
 then wait anxiously for "Dynasty". I  
 go to bed about 10:30pm.              
{ }Sunday. I get up about 9:15. We     
 leave for church at 10:15 and arrive  
 home about 12:10 and we have the      
 dinner. Afterwards I do my homework or
 go out with my family for the         
 beginning of the afternoon, then about
 4:00 we go to see my Grandparents. We 
 have tea and I do my piano practice,  
 then not much else until "That's      
 Life". After that I go to bed.
