		<title>14    THE AUCTION MART</title>
		<content>    The door swung open as more farmers
 came bustling in. They had come to see
 the selection of sheep for sale. The  
 auctioneer had just sold some sheep.  
 They were quickly rushed out of the   
 ring and some more sheep were brought 
 in. The auctioneer began to shout the 
 prices for the sheep. Nobody seemed to
 be interested. Then a farmer made a   
 sign to show that he wanted to buy the
 sheep. Another farmer started to bid  
 for the sheep. Both put up strong     
 opposition against each other. In the 
 end the one who had started second got
 the sheep. A man who sat next to the  
 auctioneer was writing down who had   
 got the sheep and for how much.       
    The hammer like object banged down.
 One brown and white ewe was sold for  
 ten pounds.Everyone began to disperse 
 and the sheep were loaded onto wagons.
 The Auction Mart had now finished.    </content>
