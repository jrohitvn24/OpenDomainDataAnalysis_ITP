		<content> "Wake up Colin," the voice of my      
 stepfather is the first voice I hear  
 of the day.I get up and after I am    
 dressed I go downstairs for my        
 breakfast.I normally have scrambled   
 egg on toast.I usually leave at 8.30am
 for school after watching TVam for 10 
 minutes.on my way to school I see the 
 same people everyday.I arrive in      
 school at 8.45 and at about 9.00am the
 register is taken and we go into      
 assembly.After that we have lessons   
 until 10.40,then it is playtime.We    
 play for 15 minutes then we have a 1  
 hours lesson.The bell rings at 12.00  
 for lunch.We are back in class at     
 1.15,at 3.15 I go home and watch      
 television.At 5.30 I have dinner and I
 go to bed at 9.00.
