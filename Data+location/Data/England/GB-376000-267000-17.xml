		<content>   A questionnaire was circulated      
 through the school and Women's        
 Institute of which we received about  
 40 completed forms. Over half the     
 families who replied were not born in 
 Worcestershire.                       
   The area is poorly supplied with bus
 services, though the{B4196}(off the   
 map) has the hourly{BIRMINGHAM/       
{STOURPORT/ WORCESTER}service. The A451
 has two services a day between{       
{EARDISTON}and {KIDDERMINSTER}on       
 Thursdays and Saturdays only.There is 
 also a regular return service between{
{ABERYSTWYTH}and{KIDDERMINSTER}each    
 Saturday and Sunday.                  
   Shops are non-existent, for the     
 local shop which recently ceased as a 
 Sub Post Office is on the B4196 as is 
 the smallholder's shop which caters   
 for all greengrocery needs, so most   
 people travel to Stourport.           </content>
