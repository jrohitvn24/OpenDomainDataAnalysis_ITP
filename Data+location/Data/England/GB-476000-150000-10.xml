		<title>10PUBS IN DOGMERSFIELD AREA</title>
		<content> The Black Horse is in Crookham        
 Village. It is owned by Courage. There
 is a garden at the rear and a large   
 car park.Horse prints and agricultural
 tools decorate the single bar, which  
 has a juke box. The Queens Head at    
 Dogmersfield is also a Courage pub,   
 both being housed in 17th century     
 buildings.However the decor is more   
 formal, mainly regimental badges and  
 local prints.The evenings at both pubs
 are busy with customers mainly in     
 their early 20s. The Horns Inn at     
 Crondall is a Phoenix house with a    
 large car park but no beer garden.    
 There are 2 bars, with a dartboard &amp;  
 fruit machine in the public one. The  
 building is quite modern. All of these
 pubs provide midday meals. The        
 Chequers Inn, Crookham is a free house
 near the Basingstoke Canal.The cosy   
 bar has prints of 80 years of royalty.</content>
