		<content> We wanted to find out what people     
 think of Marston.The questions we     
 asked were:                           
 1.Do you like Marston or not?         
 2.Why do you like Marston?

 5.Are you satisfied with Marston or   
 not?                                  
 Most people liked Marston.Several     
 because it is peaceful.One had moved  
 here because it was too noisy in      
 Derby.One of us wrote this,"My Grandad
 and Gran have lived here all their    
 lives.They both like the village      
 because it is quiet.Gran goes to      
 W.I.Grandad likes the pigeon          
 shoot".Others said they liked the     
 village atmosphere also the           
 football,gardening and shooting.      </content>
