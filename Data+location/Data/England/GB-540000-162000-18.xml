a famous old house,"Holwood",once owned
by a Prime Minister,William Pitt.It is 
owned by a firm called Seismograph     
Company,England,Limited.A seismograpgh 
is something that researches into oil  
and minerals and where to dig for      
these.                                 
In these woods there is also a famous  
oa tree called the"Wilberforce         
Oak".Under this  tree sat the Prime    
Minister,Pitt and William              
Wilberforce.Here they planned the      
abolition of slavery.A bench was       
erected on the site years later with   
thefollowing words from Wilberforce's  
diary:
