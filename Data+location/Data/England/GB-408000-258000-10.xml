		<title>10Dismantled Railway, Alcester</title>
		<content>      A dismantled railway crosses the 
 area from Alcester to Great Alne. Some
 of it can be "walked", as one Alcester
 child found out:                      
     "Through our area there runs a    
 dismantled railway line. Just N. of   
 the triangulation point it has been   
 filled in with rubbish, and wildlife  
 has taken over. Another section has   
 factories built over it. We liked the 
 part where we could walk. Alongside   
 Springfield Nurseries people walk dogs
 or take a stroll, but this path is    
 also a useful short cut. We saw lots  
 of wild flowers when we walked along  
 here. It is a good play area for      
 children who want to make dens or     
 paddle in the river by Black Bridge.  
      Near the bridge a few old sleeper
 brackets are still set in the path to 
 remind ramblers of its original use."
