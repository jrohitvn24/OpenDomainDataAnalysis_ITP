 In 1571 there was a disastrous high   
 tide which flooded wide areas along   
 the East coast. At Chapel the whole   
 village was destroyed save three      
 houses. The church did not escape     
 either for it was overthrown by the   
 water, only the steeple remained      
 standing. The flood of 1953 will long 
 be remembered by the older            
 inhabitants. A very high wind drove   
 the tide in where it broke through the
 banks and flooded a good deal of the  
 village. No lives were lost and the   
 protective work carried out on the    
 front has made a repetition of this   
 flooding most unlikely.
