		<title>01OVERVIEW OF UPPER WHARFEDALE</title>
		<content>{Upper Wharfedale}is an area of        
 outstanding natural beauty with the   
 main natural feature being the{River  
{Wharfe}from where the{'Dale '}takes   
 its name.The surrounding hillsides are
 mainly limestone and so{quarrying}is  
 extensive.                            
 Other than this quarrying, the area is
 essentially rural in character and the
 landscape is dotted with farms with   
{sheep and dairy farming}being         
 prevolent.                            
 The farming community forms the true  
 native population, although the       
 majority of people in the area now    
 travel to their work in the larger    
 towns lying to the south of the area. 
{(Skipton,Keighley,Bradford and Leeds) 
 There are many tourists in the summer 
  and so this also provides employment 
 for local people.The{Dales National   
{Park}oversees countryside care.       </content>
