		<title>05Housing In Reepham</title>
		<content> In Reepham there are new houses and   
 old houses.There are two quite new    
 estates called Bircham Road and Moor  
 House Park.Some of the houses have    
 just been built and others are up to  
 seven years old.There are no bunglows 
 in Bircham Road and there is only one 
 house which is semi detatched.Most    
 people moved there because of the nice
 area for there children to play       
 in.There are about forty to fifty     
 detatched houses on Moor House Park.  
  In and near the market place there   
 are houses which have been there for  
 over two hundred years.Going up       
 Station Road some of the houses are   
 about up to a hundred years old.Some  
 are  fifty years old.Then come the    
 bunglows.Most ofthe oldest houses are 
 near the market place,whilst most of  
 the newest houses are on the edge of  
 the town.                             </content>
