		<content>      IN MILVERTON THE LIBRARY VAN     
 COMES EVERY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND   
 PARKS BY THE SCHOOL GATE. ON HIS WAY  
 TO MILVERTON HE GOES TO WIVELISCOME   
 AND WELLINGTON. THE VAN GOES TWENTY   
 MILES IN A DAY, SO IN FIVE DAYS, THE  
 VAN WOULD TRAVEL A HUNDRED MILES. THE 
 LIBRARY VAN HAS ONLY BROKEN DOWN ONCE.
                                       
      YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TO BORROW 
 BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY VAN. IN        
 MILVERTON, ABOUT TEN PEOPLE USE IT    
 EVERY DAY. IT GETS NEW BOOKS EVERY    
 SIX WEEKS. PEOPLE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO 
 BORROW THREE BOOKS EVERY WEEK. SO FAR 
 NO ONE HAS EVER STOLEN A BOOK. WHEN   
 THE BOOKS GET TATTY THE LIBRARIAN     
 SELLS THEM TO A JUMBLE SALE TO RAISE  
 MONEY FOR NEW BOOKS. HE ENJOYS HIS JOB
 VERY MUCH.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
