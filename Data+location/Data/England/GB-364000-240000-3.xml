		<title>03ASHPERTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Ashperton School, built in 1854, is a 
 co-educational school for children    
 aged 5-11yrs. The school has a wide   
 catchment area which includes places  
 like Putley, Canon Frome and Newtown  
 Cross. There are three classes;       
 Infant, Lower Junior, Upper Junior    
 which cater for about 75 children. The
 infant classroom is used for          
 assemblies as the school does not     
 possess a hall. P.E. apparatus lessons
 take place at Bosbury Primary School  
 and swimming tuition at the Ledbury   
 Baths. The Entrance Hall has a library
 of reference books. Other equipment   
 and aids are kept in the resource     
 room. A Terrapin classroom has        
 recently been built to replace the old
 H.O.R.S.A. classroom. Each year the   
 P.T.A. holds a Fete to raise funds for
 the school.
