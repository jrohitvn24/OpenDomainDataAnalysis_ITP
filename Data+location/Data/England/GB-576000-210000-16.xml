 family live at Crix at the moment.    
 A priory was built in the village in  
 the eleventh century although the     
 original priory no longer exists. In  
 the eighteenth century John Wright , a
 famous coach builder, bought the old  
 priory, knocked it down and built a   
 fashionable new house in the grounds. 
 He had the grounds made into a        
 beautiful country estate by a         
 landscape gardener.  Mr. and Mrs.     
 Cowell bought the priory a few years

 like when it was built in the         
 eighteenth century.  They are
