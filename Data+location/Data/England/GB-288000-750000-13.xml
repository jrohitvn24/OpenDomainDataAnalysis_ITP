		<content> I get up at about eight o'clock. I    
 have my breakfast and then I get ready
 for{school.}The school mini bus comes 
 at about quarter to nine. We get to   
 school at about nine o' clock and play
 for half an hour. We go into school at
 half past nine and we do our mental   
 questions and then we do our spelling.
 We get our interval at twenty to      
 eleven. When we come back in we do our
 maths and then perhaps our Roads and  
 Transport worksheets. We get our lunch
