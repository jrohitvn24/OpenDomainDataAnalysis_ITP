		<title>10The White House Museum</title>
		<content> The White House itself is not the only
 building of interest.  You can also   
 look around the{17th Century coach    
{house and granary}which houses various
 traps and items of machinery.  There  
 is also a{Cider House,}also           
 constructed in the 17th Century,      
 complete with cider mill and press.   
                                       
 In the{16th Century stable block}is a 
 life size model of a horse and a lady 
 in beautiful riding habit.  In front  
 of the White House is the ruin of a   
{13th Century Dove Cote.               
                                       
 Gardens are numerous, each with a     
 different subject, all relating the   
 development of natural life down the  
 ages.  Chemicals have never been used 
 on this six and a half acres of       
 original Saxon Manor.
