		<title>13Thornton Parish</title>
		<content> A total of 85 people regularly attend 
 the 3 services each Sunday and 45     
 children come to Sunday School. The   
 congregation consists mainly of the   
 elderly. There are 11 people in choir,
 including two young girls but no      
 boys.Reverend Clements regards the    
 church as the heart of the community, 
 and he believes that it is society,   
 rather than the church, which is      
 changing. He would like the           
 congregation to include people of all 
 ages. He enjoys a rural parish because
 the community is close-knit. The      
 disadvantages are that people can be  
 rather narrow-minded, gossipy and     
 reluctant to accept change.
