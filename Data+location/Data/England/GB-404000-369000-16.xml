		<title>16TOURISM IN HARPUR HILL</title>
		<content> Our survey area isn't the most likey  
 area of Buxton for tourists but 19th  
 century directories of Buxton         
 recommended a trip to{Diamond Hill}to 
 find 'Buxton Diamonds';these were     
 large perfectly formed crystals. It   
 doesn't look a very interesting place.
                                       
 A little further north, near          
 Ladmanlow, is the road down to{Grin   
{Low quarry.}Now this is used as a     
{caravan site}run by the Caravan Club. 
 It is their top grade of site with a  
 toilet block and electric hook-up. It 
 was opened in{1983}and has space for  
{100}caravans. It is usually full at   
 Bank Holidays and it is a good idea to
 book in the summer (Buxton 77735).    
 People can also stay at{Staden Grange 
 and{Foxlow Farm.
