		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE OF</title>
		<content>      His most important time for Mr.  
 George is in the Autumn. His most     
 tedious job is fixing barbed wire     
 fencing, but unfortunately this is a  
 job he often has to do.               
      Farming has always been Mr.      
 Georges dream job, although in 1984 he
 had a terrible crop. The worst years  
 for him though, were 1975 and 1976    
 when there was a bad drought.         
      To help Mr. George with his      
 farming he has such implements as a   
 walking rotavator, a garden tractor,  
 and a chain saw, as well as many other
 items. These help to make farms more  
 efficient, and farming a lot faster.  
      Away from farming Mr. George does
 not have a lot of time for hobbies or 
 pastimes, although he does have a     
 passion for motorcycles.
