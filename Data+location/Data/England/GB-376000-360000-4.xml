		<content> UNEMPLOYMENT IS GROWING IN SANDBACH.  
 FROM THE SURVEY WE CARRIED OUT WE     
 LEARNED SEVERAL THINGS. UNEMPLOYMENT  
 IS MOST COMMON AMONGST THE 16-21 AGE  
 GROUP. SOME HAVE NOT WORKED SINCE THEY
 LEFT SCHOOL.{JOB PROSPECTS}ARE QUITE  
 POOR FOR WOMEN ALTHOUGH MANY WOMEN    
 CHOSE NOT TO WORK. THERE IS ALSO QUITE
 A LOT OF UN{EMPLOYMENT}IN THE OVER 50 
 AGE RANGE WHERE MANY MEN HAVE BEEN    
 MADE REDUNDANT.                       
  IN A VISIT TO THE{JOB CENTRE}IN      
 SANDBACH WE SAW SOME JOBS ON OFFER BUT
 THEY ARE NOT VERY EXCITING.THERE WERE 
 SEVERAL VACANCIES IN PUBS AND CLUBS   
 BUT THEY WERE NOT WELL PAID.IN SOME   
 CASES{TRANSPORT}IS A PROBLEM AND      
 PEOPLE HAVE TO TURN DOWN JOBS AS THEY 
 CAN'T GET TO WORK.MOST PEOPLE AGREED  
 THAT BEING UNEMPLOYED IS VERY BORING.
