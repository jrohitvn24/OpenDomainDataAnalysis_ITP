 approximately two thousand            
 inhabitants,{expanded about 100 years 
{ago}when fruit growing increased in   
 the area. It is not a picturesque     
 village but is a{friendly and pleasant
 place to live.                        
   The buildings are a mixture of old  
 and modern;{flint cottages,}some      
{weatherboard houses}and a variety of  
 more recent styles. One of several    
 large houses is{Halstead Hall,}the    
 childhood home of E.Nesbit the writer.
   Social and sporting activities focus
 around the{village hall, St Margarets 
{Church, Halstead County Primary       
{School,}and the{recreation ground.

 with{commuters.}The majority of       
 residents work outside the village in 
 nearby towns or at{Fort Halstead.     </content>
