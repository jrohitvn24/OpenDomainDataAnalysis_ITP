		<content>{" Isn't it tiny? " "We could fit it in
{our classroom." }Selham Church  is  a 
 beauty,a model of Saxon architecture, 
 nave and chancel only,tall and narrow,
 thin 11th century walls and tiny      
 windows. One capital of the chancel   
 arch has  serpents eating their own   
 tails - a Viking symbol of eternity.  
  Dense blues and reds of the shields  
 in the glass link us with the first   
 Domesday.{"EGBERT KING OF ENGLAND,    
{WILLIAM DUKE OF NORMANDY,TAILLEFER    
{COUNT OF ANGOULEME,THE KINGDOM OF     
{FRANCE AND CASTILLE,THE DUKEDOM OF    
{BURGUNDY,&amp; THE FAMILIES OF PLANTAGENET
{SCOPE,FITZALAN,AND BELLASIS."}The     
 shields commemorate the lineage of the
 children of Rector Robert Blackburn   
 who gave the Victorian glass which    
 tells the story of our salvation.     
   We found spaces for 37 people.
