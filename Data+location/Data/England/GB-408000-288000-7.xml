		<content>Over 400 home owners of houses built in
1920's by M.A.Boswell are stunned.     
Routine maintenance work in March 1984 
revealed serious structural cracks in  
walls and "top to bottem" splits in    
gable ends.Boswell houses are built of 
Cunker concrete,supported by precast   
concrete columns.Horrified home owners 
enlisted the help of Mr.R.Corbett M.P. 
and councillor Carole McKeown,to       
approach the Minister of Housing,Mr.   
Ian Gow,with a view to designating ALL 
Boswell houses as defective.Home       
owners would then be able to claim a   
government grant of up to _12,600 for  
structural repairs and the underpinning
of the foundations,therefore making    
the properties mortgage worthy.
