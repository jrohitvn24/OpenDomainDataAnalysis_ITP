		<content>    We do quite a lot of sport at      
 school. Apart from swimming (see page 
 18) this includes seven-a-side        
 football, netball, mini rugby,        
 cricket, rounders, athletics and cross
 country running. In addition to a     
 fifty minute games period each week   
 practices are held after school.      
    Netball is played on the school    
 playground and parents, teachers and  
 children recently made a jumping pit  
 at the school. Cricket is played at   
 Flimwell where they have now started a
 club for children of our age and      
 older. Most other games are played  at
 the Recreation Ground which is a ten  
 minute walk away.                     
   As well as friendly matches against 
 other schools tounaments are held for 
 schools in the Crowborough and        
 Wadhurst areas for football, netball, 
 rounders, athletics and swimming.     </content>
