		<title>01Norwell &amp; Cromwell _ General</title>
		<content>   This is mainly an{agricultural}area 
 with 2 small villages,{Norwell}and    
{Cromwell.}However, employment in      
 agriculture is now lower than at any  
 time since the original Domesday      
 Survey, the growth of{mechanisation   
 being a major reason.                 
   Fields have been made larger in     
 recent years.{Cereal crops}predominate
 with oil seed rape as a break crop.   
 The area is mainly flat with just one 
 significant rise at{Bathley Hill.     
   As{Norwell}is now a conservation    
 village the development of new housing
 is limited. Few if any of the families
 have lived in the village for more    
 than 3 generations and it has become  
 very much a commuter village.         
  {Cromwell}is a village of contrasts; 
 old housing, post war council houses &amp;
 new bungalows. The busy A1 Trunk Road 
 now bypasses Cromwell village.        </content>
