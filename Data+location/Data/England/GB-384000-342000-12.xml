		<title>12A monument in Stoke</title>
		<content>If you walk along the boulevard        
alongside London Road in West End you  
will come to a stone monument.The      
monument is to a bus conductor called  
Timothy Trow.                          
  In 1894 a canal ran alongside London 
Road,Stoke.Trams passed along this     
road.It was on April 13th that a young 
tram conductor was passing along London
Road in a tram when he saw a small girl
fall into the canal.He got off the tram
and jumped into the canal to rescue    
her.Unfortunately,Trow had an attack of
cramp and was drowned.The girl was     
rescued by an onlooker.Trow's body was 
pulled out half an hour later.Local    
people gave donations to provide a     
monument to his memory.                
  The canal was later filled in,but the
monument can still be seen along the   
boulevard,a memorial to a brave man.
