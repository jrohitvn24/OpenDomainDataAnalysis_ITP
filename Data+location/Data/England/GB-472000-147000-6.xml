 MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO RECREATION  
 IN THE AREA DO SPORT SUCH AS FOOTBALL 
 AND CRICKET.THERE IS A VILLAGE        
 FOOTBALL TEAM AND A VILLAGE CRICKET   
 TEAM . THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO GO   
 SHOOTING FOR BIRDS BUT AS THERE IS NO 
 RIVER OR STREAM OR CANAL PEOPLE       
 CAN NOT GO FISHING IN OUR             
 ACTUAL AREA. BECAUSE THE COUNTRY      
 SIDE IS VERY RELAXING, SOME PEOPLE    
 SPEND THEIR SPARE TIME GOING ON LONG  
 WALKS.  ALSO MANY PEOPLE HAVE  LARGE  
 GARDENS AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME       
 TENDING THEM.  APART FROM THESE TYPES 
 OF LEISURE PURSUITS, THERE IS NOT A   
 GREAT DEAL  TO DO IN OUR AREA         
 ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE.
