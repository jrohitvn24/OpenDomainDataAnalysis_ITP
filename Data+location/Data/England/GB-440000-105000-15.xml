		<content> HYTHE MARINA VILLAGE is a 50-acre     
 development on the western side of    
 Southampton water and is north of the 
 Solent and the Isle of Wight. The idea
 for the village was derived from the  
 best design elements in Venice. It has
 been researched in residential marina 
 developments all over the world. The  
 idea is to build stylish luxury homes,
 each one having a private berth       
 adjacent to it. The berths range from 
 10 to over 25 metres, and additional  
 berths are available for rental. The  
 tidal range in the marina will be kept
 at a Mediterranean level by an        
 entrance lock. In the extensive 'free 
 flow' period the lock gates are       
 permanently open. A resident lock     
 keeper controls the gates. The marina 
 will be made up of 225 individual     
 architect designed houses and there   
 will be restaurants bars and shops.   </content>
