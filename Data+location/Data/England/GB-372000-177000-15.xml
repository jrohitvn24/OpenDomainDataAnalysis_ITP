  For the people living in this area   
 there are a number of                 
 outdoor activities which they can     
 follow. The local gardens show that   
 gardening  must be a popular and      
 successful hobby. In June roses,lupin 
 and delphinium dominated.Horse riding 
 is popular and there were several     
 stables in and near this area.No doubt
 some of the riders participate in     
 hunting as the area lies within the   
 Beaufort Hunt district.               
  For more modern entertainment it is  
 necessary to go to the nearest towns  
 and for young people the opportunity  
 for discos is limited.One local goes  
 regularly to a Bridge club at Old     
 Sodbury. It is obvious that like many 
 others in Britain,watching television 
 is a major leisure activity.
