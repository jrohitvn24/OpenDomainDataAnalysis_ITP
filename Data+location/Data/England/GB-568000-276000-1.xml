		<title>01 General Review of the Area</title>
		<content> Our 12sq.Km. around Beck Row can be   
divided into three main categories.    
(1)Military Airfield (2)Residential    
(3)Farmland.                           
 Apart from R.A.F.Mildenhall, there    
are the two main villages of Beck Row  
and Holywell Row and the small hamlet  
of Wilde Street.                       
 The area is only 6m. above sea level  
and on the edge of a large area of     
fenland which extends North to The     
Wash. There are no streams in the area 
in I985 apart from the man-made Cut-Off
Channel,but previously there were      
several brooks or becks and much marshy
ground. The land is now mainly dry     
sandy soil with chalk sub-soil and the 
occasional area of dry peat, due to the
draining of the fen and extraction of  
water which is pumped to Essex.
