		<title>09FARRINGDON - GENERAL FACTS</title>
		<content> Farringdon dates back to Saxon times. 
 The current parish population is      
 approaching 1,000. The village is     
 popular with people who have retired  
 and in recent years quite a few new   
 dwellings have been built. But strict 
 building regulations have prevailed.  
 There is very little employment within
 the village. The Anglican church of   
 All Saints is quite well attended and 
 has links with the famous naturalist  
 Gilbert White.
