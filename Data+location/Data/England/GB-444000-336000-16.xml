		<title>16ANDREW'S SCHOOL DAY.</title>
		<content>   WE USUALLY READ OR WRITE OUR        
 DIARIES,NOBODY WRITES A GOOD DIARY,WE 
 NORMALLY HAVE BETTER THINGS TO  TALK  
 ABOUT ON THE MONDAY MORNING.          
   THE FIRST LESSON IS MATHS.  THIS    
 ISN'T TOO BAD I SUPPOSE, ALTHOUGH THE 
 WORK IS HARD. NEXT LESSON IS CREATIVE 
 DESIGN, I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT CRAFTS   
 AND ONLY REALLY ENJOY COOKERY AND     
 POTTERY. HALF WAY THOUGH, EDWARD AND I
 GO AND PLAY OUR SAXAPHONES WITH A     
 SPECIAL TEACHER.                      
   AFTER DINNER IS HUMANITIES I ENJOY  
 THIS ( BUT I WOULDN'T SAY I ADORE IT )
 LAST LESSON IS SCIENCE THIS IS ONE OF 
 MY FAVOURITES AND I AM NOT BAD AT IT. 
   AFTER LAST LESSON I GO HOME. I      
 USUALLY DO MY HOMEWORK FIRST. AFTER   
 TEA I GO INTO CHADESDEN FOR MY PIANO  
 LESSONS THIS USUALLY LASTS ABOUT      
 TWENTY MINUTES. THEN I GO PLAY WITH MY
 FRIENDS.                              </content>
