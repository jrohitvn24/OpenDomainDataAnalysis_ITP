		<title>04Footpaths.</title>
		<content> In Market Lavington there are many    
 footpaths,some of which we have       
 listed.One is called{Goatshute}because
 they used to take their goats there   
 and tether them.There is one called   
{Little Hill}because it is not as big  
 as{Lavington Hill.Periwinkle}is called
 that because it leads to a pond called
{Periwinkle Pond.The Muddle}is called  
{the Muddle}because there was a mud    
 wall at the end of it.One is called   
{Windmill Lane}because there used to be
 a windmill there.There is one called  
{Canada Rise}because of a connection   
 with the Canadian troops.{Cemetery    
{Lane}goes past the cemetery.Only older
 people use this name,the lane is now  
 called{Drove Lane,}perhaps it was once
 part of a drovers road.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
