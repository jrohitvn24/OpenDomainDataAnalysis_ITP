		<content> In Merrylees there is a distribution  
 centre.Flogas moved to Merrylees      
 because of an explosion at a depot at 
 Desford ,3 miles away.Although only   
 minor injuries  were suffered.The     
 company moved to the new safer site in
 October 1984.The site is probably the 
 safest in Europe.If there is serious  
 trouble 60,000 gallons of water per   
 hour can be pumped over the cylinders 
 to prevent an explosion.The site can  
 store 250 tonnes of Liquified         
 Petroleum Gas.The gas is bottled into 
 different coloured containers,the blue
 bottles are Butane and  the red       
 bottles are Propane.7 people work  at 
 Flogas in summer  and 10  during the  
 winter.In the summer 3 lorries are    
 need to transport the gas but during  
 the peak period which is winter 12    
 lorries are needed.
