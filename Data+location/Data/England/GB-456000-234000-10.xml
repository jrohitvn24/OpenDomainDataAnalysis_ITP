		<title>10Brackley - Paper Factory</title>
		<content>     One of the factories on the       
industrial estate in our area makes and
cuts paper. The paper is made from     
Scandinavian wood. Eucalyptus wood is  
not used because it is too shiny and it
would slip in the machines. As well as 
wood pulp, recycled paper is used to   
make new paper as this keeps costs     
down.                                  
     There are different types of      
paper. The "economy" paper smells like 
fish and chip paper! The factory also  
deals with music paper and paper of    
different colours (black, blue, grey,  
red and brown).
