    There have been quite a few        
 bungalows built in the vicinity       
 recently.                             
    The church is still carrying on    
 with new people taking an intrest.    
 To day we unfortunately have not a    
 residant Rector we have to share with 
 a number of surrounding parishes.     
    The Church, School,Forge and the   
 Brooklands,with a few others are the  
 old stone buildings,still blissfully  
 carrying on today.                    
    The Parish Hall, which was built   
 years gone by,is still retained and   
 used regularly.                       
    One very useful service, which has 
 recently been constructed, is that of 
 the sewerage disposal unit and flush  
 toilet facility."
