		<title>17AREA OF OUTSTANDING BEAUTY ?</title>
		<content> A public inquiry is being held at     
 Durham into a move by the Countryside 
 Commission to designate part of the   
 North Pennines (including Weardale) as
 an "Area of Outstanding Natural       
 Beauty." {Many residents of Weardale  
{oppose the plan because of fears that 
{the development of traditional        
{industries based on mineral extraction
{eg.(cement manufacture, fluorspar     
{processing, and limestone quarrying)  
{will be severely restricted and the   
{consequent loss of jobs and population
{would lead to a decline in the level  
{of services.}The Countryside          
 Commission is supported by the County 
 Councils, The Ramblers Association,   
 The Council for the Preservation of   
 Rural England and other conservancy   
 groups who argue that their primary   
 objective is to conserve the natural  
 beauty of the Area.                   </content>
