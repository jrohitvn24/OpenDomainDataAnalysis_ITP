		<title>07PADBURY METHODIST CHAPEL</title>
		<content> Padbury Methodist Chapel is attached  
 to the Buckingham, Bicester and       
 Brackley circuit of the Methodist     
 Church.The superintendant Minister    
 lives in Buckingham. There are 5      
 members and for administrative        
 purposes it is joined with Gawcott    
 Chapel.A service is held each Sunday  
 at 3 p.m. when the congregation       
 usually consists of about 12 people.  
 The service is mainly taken by local  
 preachers. At the same time as the    
 service a Sunday School is held for   
 village children of all denominations.
 During the winter months Padbury takes
 its turn in holding Methodist Guild   
 meetings. The present Chapel dates    
 from 1876. Prior to that meetings were
 held in a cottage which still bears   
 the name Wesley Cottage. When this    
 cottage was sold the money was kept in
 trust for the upkeep of the Chapel.   </content>
