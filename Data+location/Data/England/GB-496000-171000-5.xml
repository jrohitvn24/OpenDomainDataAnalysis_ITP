		<content>   Our area is on the whole an affluent
 one,largely untouched by the modern   
 problems of recession and             
 unemployment.Home and land prices are 
 high and are rising faster than the   
 rate of inflation.                    
   There is a preponderance of detached
 houses,many of them dating from after 
 the last war and most of the terraced 
 and semi-detached houses are also of  
 recent origins.                       
   There is little or no industry      
 within our area and so this is very   
 much a commuter belt with many people 
 working in London or along the M4     
 corridor.                             
   Local transport is fairly scarce and
 so most families are car owners by    
 necessity and not just choice.
