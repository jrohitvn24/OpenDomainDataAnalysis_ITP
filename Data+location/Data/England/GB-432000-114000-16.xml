		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF DAVID</title>
		<content> I wake up around 8.15. I get out of   
 bed and go downstairs to get breakfast
 which is cornflakes.Then Mum comes    
 downstairs.I watch Saturday Superstore
 and T.V A.M. By then it is 10.15. I   
 put my Spectrum computer on and decide
 to put the "Space Invaders" game on.  
 Afternoon shopping in Southampton is  
 very busy and noisy.We go into        
 Debenhams to look around. We have     
 chips and hamburgers in Mac Donalds.  
 we carry on up to Tyrrel and Greens   
 (a departmental store) where I buy a  
 Computer game and Mum buys some       
 kitchen utensils. We come home around 
 6.00 pm and watch T.V. We have tea    
 around 6.30 pm which is boiled egg and
 at 9.30 we go bed.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
