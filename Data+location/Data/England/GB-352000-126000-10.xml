		<title>10GAMES:SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  There are lots of different games    
 that our school play in playtimes.My  
 favourite game is rounders.A lot of   
 people like rounders.Here are some of 
 the games we play: rounders, cricket, 
 hopscotch, skipping games, ball games,
 chase and off ground touch.Most people
 in our class like rounders and cricket
 best.We have in our school a football 
 and netball team.On Wednesday         
 afternoons the boys go up to the      
 village playing field to play football
 or cricket.The girls usually stay at  
 school and play netball on the        
 playground.In the summer they play    
 rounders or short tennis.             
  Every week we go to the Strode       
 Swimming Pool in Street.There is a    
 very shallow pool for the ones who are
 learning to swim and a much bigger,   
 deeper pool for those who are better  
 swimmers.                             </content>
