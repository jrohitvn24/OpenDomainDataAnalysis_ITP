		<title>02RIVER CALDER, CALDER VALE</title>
		<content> The{River Calder}rises on Calder Fell 
 to the north of the block and flows   
 through a steep sided and sometimes   
 very narrow valley in a SW direction. 
                                       
 In times past the water has been used 
 to provide power for the machinery at 
 the various local mills, including the
 two weaving mills at Calder Vale.     
                                       
 At the bottom of Church Wood there can
 still be seen a large "lodge" or      
 reservoir where the water is diverted 
 for this purpose.  This lodge now adds
 to the attractiveness of the woods.   
                                       
 In the centre of the village the small
 but steep river valley is spanned by a
 stone bridge.                         
                                       
 To the SW, the river flows through    
 Sullom Wood to join the River Wyre.   </content>
