		<title>12A DODGING GAME.</title>
		<content>          {QUICK JACK                  
 There are two safe places (dens)      
 opposite each other.One person is     
 chosen to stand between the two       
 dens.The other players run backwards  
 and forwards from one den to the      
 other.The person in the middle of the 
 two dens has to try and touch any     
 player who runs near to him.When he   
 succeeds in touching someone,that     
 person joins him in trying to touch   
 the other players.This goes on until  
 all the players are standing in the   
 middle between the two dens.Then the  
 game starts again,with the person who 
 was touched first standing in the     
 middle of the two dens.
