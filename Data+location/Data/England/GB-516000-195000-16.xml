		<content> Transport in Borehamwood has changed  
 over the years: there are lots more   
 cars, buses,lorries and vans nowadays.
 Borehamwood has its own small bus     
 service called the BW1 which runs     
 about every half an hour. The local   
 buses are owned and operated either by
 London Transport (red buses) or London
 Country (green buses). Most of the    
 heavy lorries on local roads are      
 connected with Christian Salvesen's   
 cold storage depot in Elstree Way.    
 The railway is on the line between    
 Bedford and St. Pancras in London. It 
 was recently modernised to overhead   
 electrification and now 54 stopping   
 trains travel in each direction each  
 weekday carrying some 4000 passengers.
 Another 77 fast trains pass through   
 the station in each direction daily.  
 On Saturdays 39 stopping trains and 54
 fast trains go through Borehamwood.   </content>
