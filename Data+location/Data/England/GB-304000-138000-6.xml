		<title>06The Gamekeeper</title>
		<content>    Mr. Ward is a{Gamekeeper.  }He has 
 partridges and pheasants.   A pheasant
{lays her eggs}and he goes out and     
 takes them.   He puts them in an      
{incubator and they hatch. } He has to 
 keep the chicks warm or they will die.
                                       
    Then he puts them in a wood.       
 He goes to bed at 10 o'clock and gets 
 up at 5 o'clock.   He then has to     
 clean out the{filters}and check the   
{heaters.                           }  
     The price of an egg is 48 pence, a
 chick is 72 pence and a full grown hen
 is Â£3.                                
     The {enemies }of the birds are    
 buzzards, foxes, mink and wild cats.  
 If the hen lays 17 eggs about 3 would 
 live in nature.   He feeds them seed  
 and water.
