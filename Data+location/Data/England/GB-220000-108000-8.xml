		<title>08NATIONAL TRUST SANDYMOUTH</title>
		<content> The land around Sandymouth was bought 
 by the{National Trust}from Mr Green   
 who owned the land for over 20        
 years.The area is quite open and      
 unspoilt with a valley and stream     
 decending to{2 waterfalls}at the      
 beach. Along the steep valley is a    
 track leading to the beach and to     
 one side a single-storey stone        
 building which serves as a cafe.      
   Mr Green who lives in{Poughill}runs 
 the cafe with his wife and 3 other    
 helpers.The cafe sells hot and cold   
 drinks,pasties,and cakes.Near the cafe
 a large{car-park}has recently been    
 excavated out of the hillside.Mr Green
 is a very hospitable man and welcomes 
 everyone to the cafe. He even provides
 dogs with fresh water in a granite    
 trough outside and often feeds them   
 with scraps from the kitchen.
