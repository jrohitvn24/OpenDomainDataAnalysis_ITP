     AT SCHOOL WE HAVE A COMPUTER      
RML480Z, DUAL DISK DRIVE,EPSON PRINTER 
AND V.D.U. WE NORMALLY USE IT FOR      
PLAYING EDUCATIONAL GAMES WHICH WE LOAD
ON THE DISK DRIVE.WE ALSO WRITE        
STORIES ON THE COMPUTER AND PRINT THEM 
OUT ON THE PRINTER.COMPUTERS ARE VERY  
COMMON IN THE HOME BUT THESE MACHINES  
ARE NORMALLY USED FOR GAMES ONLY.      
     COMPUTERS ARE ALSO USED IN        
INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS.HERE ARE SOME    
EXAMPLES:IDENTIFYING CARS FOR POLICE   
PURPOSES,FLYING PLANES,ORDERING STOCKS 
FOR BIG SUPER STORES,MAKING SPECIAL    
EFFECTS IN FILMS . COMPUTERS ALSO      
MAKE AND TEST CARS.WITHOUT COMPUTERS   
MEN COULD NOT TRAVEL IN SPACE.THE U.S. 
SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA HAS 5 MAIN      
COMPUTERS WITHOUT WHICH IT COULD NOT   
TAKE OFF. BY{DAMIAN JOHNSON.}
