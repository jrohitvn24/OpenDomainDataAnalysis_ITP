		<title>12THE LITTLE BADDOW FRESCO</title>
		<content> Inside St.Marys church,on the north   
 wall of the nave,is a magnificent     
 fresco of St.Christopher.Although it  
 is now faded in parts it is still rich
 in medieval colour.The fresco was     
 painted about 1370 and shows the Saint
 carrying the  Christ child across the 
 water.Fish ,a hermit,and a chapel     
 have also been included on the        
 fresco.                               
   In medieval times wall frescos,     
 rood screens and glass were painted   
 or stained with Biblical scenes and   
 provided a visual interpretation of   
 the Bible for many of the peasants,   
 villiens and bordars.These folk       
 attended church but few of them       
 could read or understand the Latin    
 services and so relied on pictorial   
 images for their religion.
