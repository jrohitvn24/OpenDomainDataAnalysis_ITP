		<content> IN BARNET WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT      
 RELIGIONS LIKE CHRISTIAN, MUSLIM,     
 JEWISH,HINDU &amp; SIKH. WE DON'T ALL HAVE
 TO BE ONE RELIGION. YOU CAN CHOOSE    
 WHICH RELIGION YOU ARE OR WANT TO BE. 
 WE SURVEYED 3 KINDS OF CHRISTIAN      
 RELIGION-ANGLICAN, CATHOLIC NUNS AND  
 EVANGELICAL BAPTIST. WE FOUND THAT ALL
 OF THEM HELD SERVICES TWICE A DAY ON  
 SUNDAYS. THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE  
 SERVICES WERE: - ANGLICAN-RECTOR,     
 CATHOLIC NUNS-MOTHER SUPERIOR,BAPTIST-
 MINISTER.THE NUNS SPENT A GREAT DEAL  
 OF THEIR TIME IN SILENT PRAYER AND    
 SERVICES EACH DAY OF THE WEEK AS WELL.
 ALL THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS SPENT SOME  
 OF THEIR TIME TEACHING,EITHER IN      
 SCHOOLS OR AT THEIR PLACE OF WORSHIP. 
 THE REST OF THE TIME WAS SPENT IN     
 VISITING THE SICK AND THE ELDERLY OR  
 HELPING PEOPLE IN NEED.
