		<content> There is no educational provision in  
 Kynnersley.The Primary school closed  
 in 1961,children up to the age of     
 eleven,educated in the state sector   
 attend the village school in          
 Preston,just one mile away.On reaching
 secondary school age children are     
 bussed to Charlton school in          
 Wellington,the bus picking up at 8    
 o'clock.Pupils staying in full time   
 education after 16 attend a sixth form
 college or Telford College of Arts and
 Technology in Wellington.There are a  
 number of pupils attending schools in 
 the private sector either as day      
 pupils in nearby puplic schools       
 (Shrewsbury,Wrekin College ) or as    
 boarders outside the area.A number of 
 families have older children attending
 higher education outside the area.    
 There is a Mother and Toddlers club on
 Fridays in Kynnersley Village hall.   </content>
