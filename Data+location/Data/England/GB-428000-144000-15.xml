		<title>15AMPORT VILLAGE GREEN.</title>
		<content>   Amport Village Green is the heart of
 the village. On one side a line of    
 alder trees hide a small, muddy river 
 while on the other a road skirts the  
 Green wirh a row of beautiful thatched
 cottages beyond it. At one end there  
 is a climbing frame shaped like a     
 flying bug, a see-saw and swings.     
 There are benches under the alder     
 trees and a fallen trunk on which     
 children play.                        
   Fetes are held on the Green as well 
 as barbecues and a bonfire on the 5th 
 November. Young people play football  
 and cricket there; the Youth Club     
 plays rounders and the school holds   
 May Day Festivities, Easter Bunny     
 Hunts and Sports. The annual Country  
 Dance Festival in June brought        
 together 35 schools this year and over
 900 children danced on the Green.     
   Villagers exercise their dogs there.</content>
