		<content> St. Winifred's Church is believed to  
 have Saxon origins.In the Chancel is a
 13th century 'Y' shaped lancet window.
 In the Nave, the choir stalls are 19th
 century.The picina behind the organ   
 suggests there were altars on either  
 side of the Chancel opening.The series
 of 18th century memorials to various  
 local families contains excellent     
 examples of lettering. The 15th       
 century font was possibly repaired    
 after being damaged by Puritans. The  
 South Chapel is possibly 14th century 
 because of the windows of the         
 Decorated period. The Register Box of 
 1813 is fine cast-iron. The 15th      
 century Tower is in Perpendicular     
 style. The original studded oak door  
 to the newell staircase leads to the  
 belfry. The Altar is dated 1791, the  
 black oak Lectern 1870 and the Organ  
 1907.                                 </content>
