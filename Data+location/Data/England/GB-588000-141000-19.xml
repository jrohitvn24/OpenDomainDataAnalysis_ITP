		<title>19Smarden - Old Age</title>
		<content> Like most country regions, Smarden has
 many elderly folk, especially widows, 
 living alone. Tough and independent,  
 they are supported by neighbours and  
 families. The council has built small 
 but convenient bungalows much         
 appreciated by the old people who live
 in them. The Old Rectory, a State home
 housing 26, was once a rambling house 
 with large rooms which has been       
 converted and enlarged for people who 
 cannot live alone. When death finally 
 comes, parishoners may be interred in 
 the burial ground bought by the parish
 council when the churchyard became    
 full. Its situation next to the sewage
 works is by no means ideal, but       
 attempts have been made to beautify   
 it. Cremation is now very common and  
 the parish church has set aside an    
 area for the interment of ashes.
