		<content>The Cheadle &amp; Tean Times is the local  
Newspaper. It is known as 'The Stunner'
&amp; is published weekly on Thursdays for 
delivery on Fridays.Nicky Clarke       
collected the following information-   
On Friday we went to The Cheadle &amp;     
Tean Times Office for the Domesday     
Project.We saw the Editorial Room      
&amp; asked Mr.Campbell some questions.    
The paper is printed on Thursdays      
&amp; has a circulation of 26,000.The      
presses are very old.They came from    
India,where they used to print the     
'Bombay Times',that is why the quality 
is not always too good.They would cost 
75,000 to replace.We met the           
Advertising Manager &amp; he explained the 
importance of Adverts to the paper.We  
saw the Computers &amp; Decoding Machine   
&amp; finally the Dark Room.We had our     
photos taken &amp; returned to School.
