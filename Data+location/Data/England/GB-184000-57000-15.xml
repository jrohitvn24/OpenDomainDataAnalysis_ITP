		<title>15      FARM VISIT</title>
		<content>  Some of the class and I went and     
 visited Trerice 2 near Newlyn East.   
 The farm is owned by Mr Burt who got  
 it because Trerice Manor had a lot of 
 land which was sold because of        
 financial problems.Most was sold to   
 demobbed soldiers,so Mr Burt's father 
 bought it off a soldier and Mr Burt   
 inherited it.                         
  He has a Hereford bull,28 cows in    
 milk,which are Jerseys and Friesians, 
 17 year old followers,which are also  
 Jerseys and Friesians,150 ducks and   
 chickens and for game birds he has 20 
 pheasants.                            
  There are 12 farm buildings.For      
 implements he has a grass cutter, hay 
 turner, cattle feeder, vibrater,      
 slurry tanker and a Massey Ferguson   
 tractor.
