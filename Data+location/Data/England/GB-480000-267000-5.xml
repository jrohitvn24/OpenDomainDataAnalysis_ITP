		<content>I am 8 years old. On weekdays, I wake  
up at 7.30 and put on my uniform and   
get ready for school. I have cornflakes
and toast for breakfast and then I     
help with the washing-up -most of my   
friends have dishwashers. I walk to    
school with Mum, my 2 sisters and dog. 
School starts at 8.55. We go to our    
classrooms. First my teacher takes the 
register, then we book in for dinner   
at the secretary's office. After       
assembly, we do Maths and English      
until dinner time. I have hot          
dinners. At lunch time we play ball or 
running games. In the afternoon we do  
topic, Games and have a story. We go   
home at 3.30. When I get home, I       
change. On Wednesday I go to swimming  
classes. I also go to cubs. I like     
Saturday best when I go to work with   
my Dad. I wear overalls and help with  
the JCBs. I help in the garden too.    </content>
