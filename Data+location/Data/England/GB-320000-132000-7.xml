		<content> Born at Fyne Court, Broomfield in 1784
 He went to school in Bristol and then 
 to Brasenose College, Oxford. He came 
 back to live at Fyne Court. While     
 still young he became interested in   
 electrical science and technology and 
 studied electricity, chemistry and    
 mineralogy.                           
        In 1807 he experimented with   
 crystals and electricity and put up   
 1.25 miles of insulated copper wire   
 for other experiments.                
                    In 1836 at a       
 meeting of the British Association in 
 Bristol he met scientists and talked  
 about his experiments with batteries. 
 He became recognised as an important  
 scientist himself. Later he discovered
 that insects seemed to be formed in   
 experiments, which made him unpopular 
 and gave a novelist the idea of       
 FRANKENSTEIN.                         </content>
