		<content> Both Church and village are often     
 described as "a mother hen with her   
 chicks." Aerial photographs certainly 
 confirm this description, but         
 Shillington is more than just that.   
 Its 'Ends' stretch out to the borders 
 of the surrounding villages. Apsley   
 End, Bury End, Upton End, Hillfoot    
 End and Hanscombe End are to be found 
 today; others such as Duck End and    
 Frogmore End have disappeared.        
                                       
 These outlying areas incorporate the  
 agricultural aspect of village life;  
 farmers from old village families like
 the Simkins and the Jepps whose       
 grandfathers and great-grandfathers   
 have ploughed Shillington's heavy clay
 soil before them.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
