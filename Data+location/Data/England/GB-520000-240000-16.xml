		<content> HOUSING.The survey area is lightly    
 populated by a highly varied housing  
 stock. Some houses are several hundred
 years old, others are less than fif-  
 teen. Most have been built individual-
 ly, with just a few rows of identical 
 farm cottages and local authority     
 houses and even some of these are     
 privately owned. The majority of the  
 houses are stone or brick built with  
 three bedrooms, all have kitchens and 
 bathrooms and many have garages too.  
 All houses have gardens of good size. 
 ENERGY.Homes and farms in the area now
 take electricity for granted and it is
 used for everything from lighting to  
 cooking and heating since there is no 
 gas.Some homes use oil, coal, wood or 
 bottled gas particularly for heating  
 since electricity is rather expensive.
 Some people still possess the old Agas
 which use oil or wood for cooking on. </content>
