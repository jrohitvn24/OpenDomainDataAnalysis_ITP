		<title>09KING'S FRUIT FM. CONT.</title>
		<content> There are three permanent members of  
 staff but casual labour is employed   
 for pruning and fruit picking.        
   The farm has had an orchard since   
 1948 when Mr. Marvin's father moved   
 in. The trees have a fruiting life of 
 about 20 years.They are replaced on a 
 five year cycle. He buys new stock    
 rather than taking cuttings to keep   
 the plants disease free.              
    Mr. Marvin also sells conifers that
 are grown from cuttings. They are sold
 at three years old.
