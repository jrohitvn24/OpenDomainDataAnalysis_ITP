		<title>07Blackdown Wood</title>
		<content>    This{wood}belongs to{Dr. Katherine 
{Wyndham.  }It is 20 hectares.   I     
 found a piece of wood that was shaped 
 like a sea shell and I found a rotten 
 piece of wood with holes in it.   I   
 also found an eaten fir cone.   We    
 went to see the{Giants Cave}and we    
 went under an arch.   There are over  
 a{thousand new trees being planted}at 
 about a hectare a year. Dr. Katherine 
 Wyndham is chopping down old          
 tress.                                
     I saw a spider eating a little bug
 the bug had been caught in the cobweb.
 I found a pheasants feather.          
    The new trees are mostly{oak and  }
{ash,}and the trees she is cutting down
 are mostly{beech trees.   }           
 The new trees have plastic tubes round
 them to protect them.   We all did    
 bark rubbings.
