		<title>10A VISIT FROM THE MAYOR</title>
		<content>                                       
     Mr Porter came to our school on   
 Tuesday to answer some questions for  
 the Domesday project.                 
     Mr Porter has been mayor three    
 times,twice when Andover had its own  
 mayor and once mayor of Test Valley.  
     Test Valley was formed in 1974.   
     To become mayor you have to be    
 voted for by the citizens then        
 selected by the council.              
     Mr Porter told us the town badge  
 is a lion infront of an oak tree      
 because that was the badge of the Earl
 of Leicester.                         
     The Earl could grant Andover      
 anything by asking the queen.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
