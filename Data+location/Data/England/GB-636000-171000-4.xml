		<content>    The coastline is more or less      
 straight and faces north.It is backed 
 by fifteen metre high white chalk     
 cliffs with the only access by two    
 roadways, two sets of steps and one   
 lift. There is a line of sand but at  
 low tide the sea can only be reached  
 across flat rocks. At high tide the   
 sea reaches the sea defence wall which
 forms a cliff-foot promanade. This is 
 used in the summer by more than 200   
 bathing huts and three council owned  
 cafes and ice-cream parlours.         
    A bathing pool provides swimming at
 low tide. Palm Bay is very popular    
 with inshore fishermen because of its 
 access and parking.Despite being open 
 to the north sea storms, very little  
 damage has been done here. During the 
 stronger south west gales small ships 
 may be seen sheltering close inshore.
