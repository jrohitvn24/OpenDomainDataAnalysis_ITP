		<title>07Housing in Five Oak Green</title>
		<content>  uring the last 20 years our village  
buildings and population has changed.  
Most of the land was farmland,with farm
houses,cottages and post war council   
housing.                               
A new estate off Oak Road, built by    
Sunley Homes and a Gough Cooper estate,
off Sychem Lane,were built about 20    
year ago.                              
The value of these houses has risen    
from 4950 pounds to 38000 pounds       
upwards.                               
To accommodate the increased population
the Victorian school was extended and  
modernised.                            
A Community Centre was built.There was 
much argument about the centre.People  
thought there would be a lot of noise. 
Now it is fully used for community     
activities.                            
There are many converted oasts ,they   
became redundant as farm buildings.    </content>
