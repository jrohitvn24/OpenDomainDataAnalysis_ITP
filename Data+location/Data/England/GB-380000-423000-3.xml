		<content> Crawshawbooth County Primary School is
 situated on the main Rawtenstall to   
 Burnley road (A56), between           
 Crawshawbooth and Loveclough. The     
 school building is semi-open plan with
 separate playgrounds for junior and   
 infant children, a large playing field
 and an open outlook to the rear.      
 The school has 307 children on role,  
 split into 10 junior and infant       
 classes. There are 12 full-time and 2 
 part-time teaching staff. The number  
 of children at the school is          
 increasing due to recently developed  
 housing estates at Loveclough and     
 Reedsholme, catering for many families
 with children of primary school age.  
 School begins at 9.00 a.m. and ends at
 3.30 p.m., with a 20 minute morning   
 break and 75 minutes lunch break.     
 School meals are prepared on the      
 premises for those who require them.  </content>
