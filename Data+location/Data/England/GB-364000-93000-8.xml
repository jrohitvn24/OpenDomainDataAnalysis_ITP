		<title>08Employment in Stratton</title>
		<content> Of the 250 adults who live in         
 Stratton, Ash Hill, Grimstone and     
 Wrackleford, thirty are retired, and  
 ten of these live alone. Farming      
 supports five farmworkers, a manager, 
 gamekeeper and the two estate owners  
 and their respective families.        
 Herrison Hospital employs thirteen,   
 including administrators, nurses and  
 occupational therapists.  Six work far
 afield, twelve in Dorchester, ranging 
 from shop assistants to two librarians
 and a policeman.  There is small      
 settled core of families,but the      
 majority of households change every   
 four or five years.  There are only   
 three self-employed: a book binder    
 running his own firm, a motorbike     
 specialist and an antique car         
 restorer, but only the latter works in
 the village. There is no craft or     
 employment  apart from farmwork, here.</content>
