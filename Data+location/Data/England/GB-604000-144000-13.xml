		<title>13The museum in Brook</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The museum in Brook is in a tithe barn
 which was built in the fourteenth     
 century.  It was uised originally to  
 store crops.  Every farmer had to give
 one tenth of his crops to the monks of
 Canterbury who owned this barn and    
 these were stored here.               
 Nowadays the barn is full of old      
 agricultural machinery, mostly        
 Victorian.  The most interesting      
 things are the old farm waggons.      
 There is a Kent Waggon which is blue  
 and a Thanet waggon and a Sussex      
 waggon.                               
 At the back of the barn is a          
 nineteenth century oast house.  This  
 is part of the museum and also  has   
 lots of old tools and rat traps in it.
