		<title>17Business Computers in Maltby</title>
		<content> A number of shops in Maltby use       
 computers to help their business. Our 
 local newsagent has installed a       
 computer to help him with stock       
 control and to sort out monthly wages 
 as well as organising his paper       
 rounds.The computer also helps by     
 printing out the customers' bills.    
 The computer is also a cash register  
 and contains the takings for the day. 
 It cost over Â£4000. The discs cost Â£40
 for 10.                               
 The chemist's shop in Maltby High     
 Street also uses a computer. In this  
 shop, it is used to print out the     
 labels on prescriptions. The computer 
 will soon be used to re-order drugs   
 etc: by telephone line which will make
 the system much quicker.              
 Many other companies in Maltby use    
 computers to make their business more 
 efficient.                            </content>
