		<content> Mr and Mrs J Black are arable farmers.
 They used to keep pigs, cows and a    
 bull. They originally lived in        
 Scotland.  20 years ago they grew     
 sugar beet, potatoes and barley.  Now 
 they grow oil seed rape and wheat.    
 They own a lot of machines - two      
 combines, eight tractors, one plough, 
 one draining machine, harrows,        
 rollers, seed drills, fertilizer      
 sreader, digger, hedge cutter,        
 trailers and an old lorry which is    
 used to cart grain.  The land is very 
 heavy clay.  The farm belonged to St. 
 Bartholmew's hospital in 1840 and it  
 was 158 acres.  Now it is 1300 acres. 
 Mr. Black, his two sons, two full-time
 workers and a student do the work.    
 In 1959 nine men did the work.  The   
 farm was much smaller then.  The house
 is  about 150 years old.  They have   
 lived here since 1959.                </content>
