		<title>13THE VILLAGE OF WALMER BRIDGE</title>
		<content>     Walmer Bridge is a small community
 of modern houses. Most of these have  
 been built since 1960. There is a     
 small unit of shops with flats over,  
 and a Co-op which sells groceries and 
 has an off-licence                    
{    A village Hall}has been built by  
 local fund raising and grants from    
 Local Authorities. This is now used   
 for disco's and meetings. An antique  
 fair is held there regularly on       
 Sundays.                              
     Some of the older houses have     
 land which is used for{nurseries}where
 plants are grown on the moss, many of 
 the seeds are started under glass.    
     One unusual business in the very  
 heart of the village, is a{mushroom   
{farm.}The mushrooms are grown in a    
 dark shed on horse manure, which is   
 readily available here.
