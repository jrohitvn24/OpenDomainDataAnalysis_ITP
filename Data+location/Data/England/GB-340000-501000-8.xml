		<content> Every year in November the traditional
 Hunt Week takes place. The Coniston   
 foxhounds are temporarily kenneled at 
 one of the local farms and two or     
 three hunts are held during the week. 
 A hunt 'ball' with supper is held at  
 the Institute and up to 100 people may
 come. It is a major social event for  
 the community.                        
 Shepherd's Meet takes place on one of 
 the days. Its origins stretch back    
 many years to the days when it was the
 time for collecting and distributing  
 sheep which had strayed in earlier    
 months. Today it is dealt with by Land
 Rover and trailer as it happens, but  
 the tradition is kept alive by making 
 a pen at the Queen's Head for stray   
 sheep brought in for sorting. Hounds  
 and harriers meet, hot pot is served  
 all day and there is a sing-song after
 the hunt.                             </content>
