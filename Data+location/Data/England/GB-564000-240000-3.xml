		<title>03The Splash,a Village Ford.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Suffolk name for a ford is{splash.
 People usually drive straight through 
 the splash but on the{20th June 1984  
 there was a freak storm.The splash    
 rose to four feet and flooded the     
 village.Some people tried to drive    
 through.One van with a diesel engine  
 got through but the rest broke down.  
 The splash is at the end of{Church    
{Street}at the junction with{Water     
{Lane.}The river that flows through    
 the village is called the Bumpstead   
 Brook.Near to the splash is{Broadgate 
{House}where{A.A. Milne}used to live.  
 Perhaps watching children play at the 
 splash gave him the idea of the game  
 of Pooh sticks. Children of the       
 village still play the game here and  
 at the Claywall Bridge. We would like 
 to think it was thought of here.      
 People wash their cars in the splash. </content>
