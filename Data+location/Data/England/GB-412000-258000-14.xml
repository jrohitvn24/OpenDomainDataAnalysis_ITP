 the past 45 years,The greatest of     
 which being the closure of the railway
 which used to run through Great Alne  
 until 1951 or 1952.

 Cantlow but that closed down.         
    The Boot Inn on The Mill road was  
 closed in 1961 and has been made into 
 three houses.

 been built over the past 45 years,some

 taken down.Also towards Little Alne a 
 power sub-station has been built.A

 grubbed out the hedges to enlarge     
 their fields.
