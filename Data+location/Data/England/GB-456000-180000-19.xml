		<title>19THE "TWINNING" OF GORING</title>
		<content>                                       
      The principle of{twinning}is to  
 help promote friendship and           
 understanding between different       
 countries.  For these reasons Goring  
 Parish Council decided in 1977-78 to  
 "twin" with a French town and applied 
 to the British Council for a suitable 
 twin town.                            
      Of those offered,{Belleme}in     
 Normandy was chosen because it is of a
 comparable size to Goring, is also in 
 an agricultural area and is relatively
 near the Channel which facilitates    
 visits.  In 1979 there were official  
 ceremonies in both towns to celebrate 
 the twinning of Goring and Belleme.   
      Membership of the{Goring-on-     
{Thames Twinning Association,}which is 
 run by an elected Management          
 Committee, is open free to the entire 
 population of Goring and area around. </content>
