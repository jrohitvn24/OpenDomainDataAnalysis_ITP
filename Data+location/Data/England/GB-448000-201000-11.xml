		<title>11 Observer Corps-Boars Hill</title>
		<content>    A Royal Observer Corps post is     
situated on Boars Hill and is manned by
local volunteers. The Royal Observer   
Corps is part of the United Kingdom    
Warning and Monitoring Organisation.   
Its function would be to issue warnings
to the public of pending air attacks on
this country, to plot the position of  
explosions caused by nuclear weapons   
and to monitor resultant radio-active  
fall-out produced by such weapons.     
Warning of approaching fall-out would  
be issued to the public by means of    
maroons so that people could take cover
in prepared fall-out shelters. Everyone
realises that a nuclear war would be   
catastrophic for the whole world but   
the threat remains and provides one of 
the fears of our lives in the 80's
