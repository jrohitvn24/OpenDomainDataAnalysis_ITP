		<content> Our parish is called{Worthen}parish.  
 It is divided into three wards which  
 are called Heath, Hope and Worthen.   
 Our ward is Heath ward. There are{1697
 people in our parish and{1371}are over
 18. We have 16 parish councillors, 5  
 for Heath and Hope and 6 for Worthen. 
 They have elections every four years. 
 At present the parish council have a  
 lot of work involving{footpaths}and   
{bridle-ways.}                         
 The last mapping of these was done in 
{1908}but now they are reviewing it and
 checking to see if they are passable. 
 Wealthy people left money to the      
 parish council, this was put in the   
 bank and the interest is given to the 
 poor. Filled graveyards are the parish
 councils responsibility. They get     
 money for road mending from the rates.
 The clerk doesn't get paid much. Money
 for schools comes from the rates.     </content>
