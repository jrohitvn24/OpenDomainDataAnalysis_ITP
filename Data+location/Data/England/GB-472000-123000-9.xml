		<title>09CHURCH OF ST.PETER</title>
		<content> St. Peter's stands in the centre of   
 the town near the Square. There was a 
 building on the site soon after the   
 time of the Domesday Book, but it was 
 altered and extended in later times.  
 The North and South doors of the      
 church were built in Norman times and 
 have the rounded arches which the     
 Normans were good at building.        
 Since the starting of the Parish      
 Communion Service in the 1960s this   
 has become the most popular act of    
 worship. The Alternative Services Book
 1980 is used mostly, but the Book of  
 Common Prayer has not been abandoned. 
 There are services in the church most 
 days of the week.  Relationships with 
 other Christian denominations in the  
 town are good, and United Services are
 held several times a year. The Good   
 Friday Act of Witness in the Square is
 one of the most important.            </content>
