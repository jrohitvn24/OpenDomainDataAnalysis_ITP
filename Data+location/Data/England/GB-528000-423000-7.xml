		<content>{WHITE HALL AT WINESTEAD}              
                                       
 White Hall was built in 1815 at a cost
 of Â£14,000.00  It is a Grade II listed
 building occupying 100 acres of land. 
 There are 22 rooms, the library being 
 of great interest with its three walls
 of very old books with four corner    
 sections reminiscent of the Brighton  
 Pavilion.  This room has not been     
 decorated since 1870.                 
 There are two lodges connected with   
 White Hall named as the Main Lodge and
 Lane Lodge.                           
 There are only two part-time staff    
 employed now.                         
 Close by the house are Ilix trees     
 which is unusual as these are not     
 normally found so far North.          
 Four hundred Elm trees have had to be 
 destroyed because of Dutch Elm        
 disease.                              </content>
