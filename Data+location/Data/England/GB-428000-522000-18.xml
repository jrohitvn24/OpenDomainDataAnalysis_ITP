		<title>18Aycliffe Village-Buildings</title>
		<content> The village is built on limestone and 
 dates back before 700 A.D. The early  
 buildings were mud and wattle.Present 
 lay-out of the village is defensive   
 medieval with narrow entrances for    
 protection.Many of the older houses   
 are built of stone but more recently  
 brick has been used for a Council     
 estate and for private homes as the   
 village becomes a dormitory area for  
 Newton Aycliffe,Darlington &amp; Teesside.
 Although quarrying &amp; farming have been
 the main forms of employment for      
 centuries,at one time weaving was a   
 major industry &amp; the houses on the    
 East side of the Green had huge lofts 
 used as weaving sheds.The Church which
 was the centre of village life was cut
 off when the A1(now A167)was          
 built.Stories exist about tunnels from
 the Church to Monks End and Aycliffe  
 House,now the site of South Grove.    </content>
