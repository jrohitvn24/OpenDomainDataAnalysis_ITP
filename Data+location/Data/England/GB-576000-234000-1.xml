		<content>{ Castle Hedingham}is a very compact   
 village although there are lots of    
 large arable farms growing mainly     
 wheat, barley, beans and sugar        
 beet.                                 
  The village is really centred around 
 the Norman Keep. At the west side of  
 the village is the main road, the     
 A604. Running parallel to the A604 is 
 a steam railway which had been        
 demolished but is now being rebuilt as
 a railway museum.                     
  The buildings that small businesses  
 use were not always used for that     
 purpose.                              
  There are 900 people on the electoral
 roll and 52 children under 5, 128     
 children from 5-11 and 72 from        
 11-18. There are two new estates      
 which were built in 1965 and 1974.
