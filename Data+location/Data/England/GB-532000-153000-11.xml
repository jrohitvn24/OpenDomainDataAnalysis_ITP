		<content>{CHURCH OF THE SACRED HEART}           
  The Roman Catholic parish of Caterham
 was re-formed in 1879 when Fr.Roe was 
 appointed resident priest. The stone- 
 built church was opened in 1881. A    
 spire was planned but money ran so it 
 has a spiral staircase going nowhere! 
  When the church was being built      
 workmen took a{BARREL OF BEER}from    
 outside the Blacksmiths Arms. When the
 police were called the barrel was     
 hidden in the church foundations and  
 concreted over. In 1930 a north aisle 
 and new porch were added.             
  In the 106 years of the parish's life
 there have only been 5 parish priests.
 In the first 100 years there were only
 3, Canon Francis Roe, Canon Walter    
 Cooksey and Fr. Cyril Scarborough.    
  To celebrate the{CENTENARY}of the    
 parish a new Parish Centre was built  
 in 1979.                              </content>
