{College, Tollerton.                   
 In June 1984 Geoff Dakin and Keith    
 Brewes acquired the use of the lake in
 the college grounds. Since 1700 the   
 four and a half acre lake has reduced 
 to 9640 square metres. In preparation 
 for farming, they removed 30,000 tons 
 of silt. By the early months of 1985  
 there were 3000 fish (American Brook  
 Trout-a rare fast maturing fish-one   
 year from fry to table). Planned      
 expansion includes units for cutting, 
 freezing and smoking the fish. The    
 fresh fish is to be supplied directly 
 to restaurants and frozen to          
 Nottingham market. The imminent sale  
 of the Hall following the close down  
 of St. Hugh's College puts this       
 enterprise at risk.
