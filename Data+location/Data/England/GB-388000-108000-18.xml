		<title>18Blandford Bypass.  Pimperne.</title>
		<content> Blandford Bypass was opened in May    
 this year.It has taken three years to 
 build.It will stop many cars          
 and heavy lorries from going through  
 Blandford and also prevent the queues 
 of traffic in the summer.It has been  
 impossible to get into Blandford from 
 Pimperne at week ends because of the  
 queue of cars from Blandford traffic  
 lights.                               
 Already many local people feel that   
 cars are going too fast on the bypass.
 They say that the roundabouts are too 
 small,that cars do not slow down to go
 round them but try to beat others     
 coming in from the left.
