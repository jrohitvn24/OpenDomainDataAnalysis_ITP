		<title>05HUNT BROTHERS FOUNDRY</title>
		<content>  Hunt Brothers was established in     
 Oldbury over 100 years ago and employs
 150 people. The foundry is involved   
 in the latest developments of casting 
 technology, producing all metal       
 products such as counter weights for  
 fork lift trucks and even train       
 engines. The metals used include grey 
 iron, alloy nickel, chrome and        
 haematite. These have a weight range  
 from a few pounds to 50 tons. The     
 scrap iron is melted down to a liquid 
 and poured into moulds. When the      
 liquid is poured into the casting it  
 has a temperature of between 1300 and 
 1400 degrees. Moulds and cores are    
 made using air setting sand systems.  
 250 tons of sand are used each week to
 produce castings from old or existing 
 patterns. The pattern workshop is     
 capable of producing all patterns     
 needed in wood.                       </content>
