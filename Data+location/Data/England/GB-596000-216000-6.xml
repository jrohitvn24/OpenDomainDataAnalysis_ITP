 Like the village of{Peldon,}the church
 of{St. Mary the Virgin}has its origins
 in the 11th century and is mentioned  
 in the {Domesday Book.}It was probably
 an{Anglo-Saxon}building.              
 The present church is{Norman}and the  
 Nave dates back to the 12th century.  
 The{Tower }was added in the 14th      
 century, and the{Nave buttresses, roof
 and{Clerestory}were added in the 16th 
 century.                              
 The modern church is flourishing,     
 which reflects the fact that though   
 Peldon is a very old village, it is   
 still living and growing.
