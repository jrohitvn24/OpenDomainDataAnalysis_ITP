		<content>There are many animals kept at Astley  
Bridge Farm.These include ducks that   
live near the river during the summer  
and in sheds near the duck pool in the 
winter.They also have cows and calves  
Some of the calves have been bought at 
local markets.They are kept in sheds   
while the cows go out into the fields. 
The cattle are sold for beef at a live 
market and are often sent abroad for   
food.The farm has 650 lambs and about  
400 sheep.The sheep are dipped in a    
mixture of water and disinfectent      
twice a year and they are sheared in   
the summer.They have twelve sheep dogs 
and four pups.Mr Calcutt keeps the     
dogs as a hobby.
