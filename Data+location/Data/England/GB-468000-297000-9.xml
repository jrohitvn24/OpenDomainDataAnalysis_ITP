		<title>09Illston -The Fernie Hunt</title>
		<content> Fox hunting still thrives in this     
 area.  The hunt meets twice a week on 
 Wednesdays and Saturdays from October 
 to March.  The season begins with     
 cubbing in which the hounds split the 
 young cubs away from their family     
 groups and so disperse the fox        
 population throughout the area.  The  
 hunt is well supported and anything   
 from 100 to 150 horses and riders     
 usually take part.  The kennels for   
 the hounds are at Great Bowden and    
 about 30 beagles (called 15 couples)  
 usually take part in a hunt.  Most of 
 the hunting people are working farmers
 and their families. There is a growing
 concern about fox hunting and it is   
 seen by some people to be a cruel     
 blood sport.  Some landowners will not
 allow the hunt on their property.
