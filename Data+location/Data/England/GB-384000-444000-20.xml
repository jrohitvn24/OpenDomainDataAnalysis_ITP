		<content>I am Carl Omerod I am 9 years old.I    
 ive at Rainhall Road.This is my       
family, I have one sister she is Lydia 
Omerod,and she is 6 years old. My mum  
is called Caroline,she is 26 years old.
My  dad works all week,he is far away  
so he does not come home and I miss him
a lot.We go to bed at 9 oclock.I have a
bunk bed . My sister sleeps in another 
bed in another room. We get up at 8.00 
and have our breakfast and come to     
school.                                
                                       
At home I always watch the  televison  
until 5.0 clock because then it is     
time   for tea.We bought a new cooker  
a month ago because the old cooker blew
up, now we have better food. I don't   
have my tea until 5.00 because my mum  
does night shift work and she doesnÂ£t  
get up until 5.00 oclock.              
                                       </content>
