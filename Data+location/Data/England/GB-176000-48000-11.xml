		<title>11ROADSIDE SALES, ALLET,TRURO.</title>
		<content> In addition to Allet garden shop,     
 several farms including Hillview Farm 
 sell produce from the gate &amp; a green- 
 grocer's van calls regularly.  Many   
 farmers grow vegetables for themselves
 &amp; as animal food,&amp; to sell direct from
 the farm.Swedes,locally called turnips
 are 15p.each;broccoli or cauliflowers,
 25p.each: these are normally left by  
 the gate with a container for money;  
 there seems to be no problem with     
 "shoplifting".                        
 One acre can grow about 15 tons of    
 potatoes &amp; no quota is needed for this
 small amount but they cannot be sold  
 to the Potato Marketing Board. Typical
 prices at the moment for 25kg.bags are
   _second early, eg. Maris Peer,Â£1.60;
   _maincrop, eg.Desiree,Pentland Dell,
   Â£1.90.  (October, 1985).            
 Sales are steady,to regular customers 
 &amp;passing trade.Quality is mostly good.</content>
