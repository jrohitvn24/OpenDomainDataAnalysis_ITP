		<content> It was a glorious sight leaving the   
 town and walking through the fields of
 barley where poppies grew at the edge.
  We saw sparrows, swifts and starlings
 flying low looking for lunch.         
 Some cows were grazing in one field   
 and a pony came up to the fence to    
 greet us.  There were two alsatian    
 dogs guarding the yard of Giddygate   
 farm.  Moss and wallflowers were      
 growing over the old walls. In the    
 canal we saw ducks, some dead roach   
 and one dead barn owl.  We have our   
 own pond and sanctuary arena at school
 and a tree nursery for young oak and  
 chestnut trees that we have grown from
 seeds.   In the pond are newts, frogs,
 a toad, some roach, tench and crucian 
 carp.  There are yellow iris, reeds,  
 water lilies, pondweed, duckweed,     
 snails and waterboatmen.   Many garden
 birds come to feed from the bird table</content>
