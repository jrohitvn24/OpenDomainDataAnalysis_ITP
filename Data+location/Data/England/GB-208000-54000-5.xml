		<content> In the {afternoons}we have{all sorts  
{of lessons,}so I will tell you about  
 them.                                 
 We have lessons like History,         
 Geography or Topic. This term we have 
 had two topics,{The Domesday Project} 
 and {Life in the 1800's.}We visited   
 Morwellham to see a mining village so 
 we could imagine what Tywardreath was 
 like.                                 
 In summer we go{swimming}three times a
 week. We have our own pool. It is     
 indoors and heated but not very deep. 
 I enjoy{music.}I play descant and     
 treble recorders and guitar. Most     
 groups are after school. In winter we 
 have P.E. and Netball or Football and 
 in the summer swimming and athletics. 
 I play{Netball}for the school. Netball
 and Football teams practise twice a   
 week after school. We have 2 netball  
 courts and 2 football pitches.        </content>
