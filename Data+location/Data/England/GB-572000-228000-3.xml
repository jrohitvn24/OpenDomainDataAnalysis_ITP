		<content>      There was one large room, ie two 
 classrooms back to back.There were    
 separate playgrounds and cloakrooms   
 for boys and girls.                   
      The children did reading, writing
 and arithmetic. Girls did knitting and
 boys gardening. Teeth and hair were   
 checked monthly by{"Nitty Norah".     
      Children bought sandwiches for   
 lunch, usually dripping, jam or egg.  
 Cocoa was sold at \d a cup when the   
 kettle was put on the fire.There was  
 no electricity so a tortoise stove and
 open fire heated the rooms.           
      Water was fetched from a pump.   
 Later, mains water was connected to a 
 tap over a sink.                      
      The toilets were buckets. Twice a
 week a man dug a hole in the ground   
 and emptied them. For toilet paper,   
 newspaper squares were used. These    
 were cut by children as a punishment. </content>
