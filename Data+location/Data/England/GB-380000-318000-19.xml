		<content>  There are many clubs and activities  
for children and adults in Gnosall.    
  I belong to the cubs and I belong to 
the Dragon Pack. At the moment we are  
doing first aid. Last Wednesday we     
played rounders against Lion Pack and  
we won. At cubs we make all sorts of   
things, knots, dragons for St. George's
Day, bird boxes.                       
  The Gnosall Division of the St.      
John's Ambulance meets on Monday nights
for cadets and juniors. Adults meet on 
Thursdays. You learn first aid and     
nursing and how to cope in an          
emergency. You provide first aid cover 
at local functions.                    
  Women's Institute meetings are held  
once a month in the village hall. There
may be a guest speaker, a bring and buy
stall and a competion. Members take it 
in turns to serve tea and biscuits at  
the monthly meetings.                  </content>
