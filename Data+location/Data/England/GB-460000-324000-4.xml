		<content> In July 1978 a number of parents of   
 children at Willoughby Primary School 
 formed a group and called themselves  
 the{Friends of Willoughby School.}It  
 was formed to provide funds for       
 improving facilities at the school    
 and to help keep the school open      
 when the number on roll was low.Most  
 years the Friends of Willoughby School
 hold a family Bar_b_que and Disco, a  
 christmas Dance and they have         
 previovsly held a Donkey Derby and a  
 Car Rally.The money raised has been   
 used to provide the school with the   
 cabin,which provides extra            
 classroom space, an overhead projector
 and screen, a television set and      
 sports equipment.The functions        
 organised are attended by many people 
 from the village especially the       
 parents of the pupils at the school.
