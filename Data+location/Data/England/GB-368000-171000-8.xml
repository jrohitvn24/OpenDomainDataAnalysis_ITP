		<content> The{Stone Masons}is situated near     
{Redfield Edge}which is a primary      
 school near to{S.B.L.}It is owned by a
 man called Alan Tancock and has had   
 the buisness now for fourteen years   
 and he also lives on the premises. The
 kind of things they make are          
 Ornaments, Paving Slabs and walling   
 blocks and they are all sold to the   
 public or buisness contractors as far 
 away as Worcester. The number of staff
 he employs depends on the             
 steason; most of the year he employs  
 one or two, but in April to September 
 he will employ as many as six men.    
    There also is a very old building  
 on the premises which is said to have 
 been a cobblers shop nearly 100 years 
 ago.
