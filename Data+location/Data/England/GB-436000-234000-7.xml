		<content> MR.D.K.TAYLOR HAS LIVED AT LOWER NILL 
 FARM SINCE 1943. HE RAISES ARABLE     
 CROPS (250 ACRES OF WHEAT OIL-SEED    
 RAPE AND BARLEY)  AND CHICKENS. HE HAS
 A PROBLEM WITH GRASSWEEDS AND ALSO    
 WITH CROPS BEING SPOILT BY THE WIND   
 AND HEAVY RAIN. THE GRAIN FOM THE     
 CROPS IS WASHED, DRESSED AND DRIED    
 SO IT CAN BE USED FOR SEED PLANTING   
 THE NEXT YEAR. THE REST IS SOLD OFF   
 FOR FODDER. HE HAS 6 CHICKEN HOUSES   
 WHICH CONTAIN 30,000 ROSS AND COBB    
 CHICKENS.  THE RAISING OF THE CHICKENS
 IS DONE IN A 7 WEEK CYCLE UNTIL THEY  
 ARE FAT ENOUGH TO SELL.  ON OUR FIRST 
 VISIT TO THE FARM THEY WERE ALMOST    
 READY TO BE SOLD AND THE CHICKEN      
 HOUSES WERE VERY NOISY,SMELLY &amp; FULL. 
 OUR 2ND VISIT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF 
 THE CYCLE AND THE CHICKENS WERE TINY  
 BUT EVEN THEN THEY WERE WORTH OVER Â£1 
 EACH. A VERY LARGE &amp; IMPRESSIVE FARM. </content>
