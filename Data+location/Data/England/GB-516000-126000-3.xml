		<title>03Ghyll House Farm</title>
		<content> Some of us went to visit Ghyll House  
 Farm which is owned by Mr T. Phillips.
 The main{tools}that they use are grass
 cutters and ploughs.Mr Phillips owns  
 about 300 acres and{employs}2 people  
 to look after the land and seasonal   
 workers.The busiest time of the year  
 for them is hay making season as they 
 only grow grass for the{cattle}to     
 graze on.Their farm is a meat breeding
 farm. They own about 26  cows, which  
 costs Â£500 each to keep for one year  
 Each  cow is sold from Â£400 to Â£600.  
 They own 6 rams,6 dogs,800{pheasants, 
 chickens and ducks.All the land that  
 they own is mostly clay,and some land 
 is easy to plough,but some land isn't.
 Two of their dogs are alsatians and   
 they are guard dogs.
