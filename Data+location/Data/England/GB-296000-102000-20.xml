 pool whereas the juniors travel to    
 Clyst Hydon pool.Many children enjoy  
{athletics}and win certificates.Some   
 also play{cricket and rounders.}Boys  
 are particularly keen on{BMX bicycles 
 and break_dancing.Several girls enjoy 
{cricket, volleyball}and going to      
 discos.                               
     Television remains a favourite    
 pastime as does playing games on      
{computers. Chess}has been popular and 
 younger children play chase, sticky   
 glue, Shirley Temple and stringers. It
 is true that hopscotch remains an     
 interest.                             
      It is probably true that children
 walk less than they did and also that 
 they have not really become involved  
 in the{Cullompton Sports Centre.}Many 
 organisations cater for their needs.  </content>
