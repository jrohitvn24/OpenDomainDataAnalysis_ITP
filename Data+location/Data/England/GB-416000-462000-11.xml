		<title>11GLASSHOUSES SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Metcalfe Family opened the the    
 school in the Mill in 1840 in order   
 that the children who worked at the   
 Mill could be educated at the same    
 time. It cost each child 2d per       
 week. In 1860 the school moved into a 
 newly-built schoolhouse across the    
 road from the Mill and at that time   
 there were about 160 pupils, all part-
 time and it was not until 1895 that   
 the Schools Board took over the       
 school.                               
 Today the school has 42 pupils, who   
 are housed in an enlarged school      
 (about 1913) which has a room for the 
 infants, one for the juniors, and a   
 third for the teachers; they also have
 indoor toilets and a cloakroom; they  
 may have school dinners or take packed
 lunches and they spend their playtimes
 in the two playgrounds and gardens    
 surrounding the school.               </content>
