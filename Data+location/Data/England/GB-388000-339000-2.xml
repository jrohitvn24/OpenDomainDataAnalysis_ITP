The area that we visited was a pleasant
walk. We started at Brookhouse along   
Barlaston Old Road and walked towards  
Wedgwoods. On the way we saw many      
points of interest such as the sewage  
works.                                 
We saw rough grazing land along        
Barlaston Road, and farm houses, but   
we occasionally saw houses in groups   
of ten. After crossing the road        
leading up to Wedgwoods we came to a   
field which we had to cross to get to  
the canal.                             
The field was used for rough grazing   
and we had to watch our step as there  
were cowpats all over the place. When  
we reached the canal we went under the 
fence and on to the towpath. We saw    
lots of interesting things, but found  
that there were mainly houses by it.
