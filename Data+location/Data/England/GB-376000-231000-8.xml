		<title>08M.50 Motorway</title>
		<content> Mrs Jones has worked here since 1955  
 and the motorway was started 4.5 years
 after in 1959 and was finished in 1976
 17 years later.Mrs Jones and another  
 teacher went to see the cavalcade.They
 walked down the motorway and it is    
 now called the M50.The motorway is    
 around 50 to 60 meters away.We can    
 hear cars and lorries all day         
 mostly.Some days its not so loud.     
              The other side of the    
 motorway is a house.People used to go 
 to the house down a lane, next to the 
 school. Now they have to go over a    
 bridge, and up a road, and down a     
 passway.To get on the motorway you    
 need to go to Tewkesbury or Ledbury as
 that is where the nearest junctions   
 are situated.
