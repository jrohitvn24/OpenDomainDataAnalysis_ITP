		<content> In this rural area there is not a lot 
 of industry.Most of the land is for   
 agriculture use.People in this area,  
 men and women,travel to large towns   
 and cities to work but at one time    
 most of the people worked in the      
 villages.The area was traditionally a 
 mining area,with four mines with many 
 seams in Hunwick alone.The Pipe works 
 and the Brick works were built because
 there was a large supply of clay.The  
 biggest single industrial company in  
 our area is Dyson Refractories in the 
 village of Hunwick.Also there is a    
 ready mix concrete works near         
 Beechburn on the edge of our area.
