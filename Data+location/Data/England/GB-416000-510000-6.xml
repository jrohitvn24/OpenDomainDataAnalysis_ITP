		<content>   There  are  no  public  bus services
 which pass through this block. Chidren
 who  attend  primary school  are taken
 to/from  Aldbrough St. John  daily  by
 taxi whilst any  secondary school aged
 children  are  picked up by a  private
 bus which also  serves other  villages
 between   here  and   Richmond.   Most
 households  now  have a car and as the
 nearest  shop  and  post office  is at
 least  one mile  away, at  Eppleby  or
 Aldbrough, a car is almost a necessity
 for members of this isolated area.    
                                       
   There  is  no  village hall,  public
 house or any  social group within this
 community. A public mains water supply
 came to   Stanwick  and  Carlton  only
 within  the  past  10 years  or so and
 there is still no mains sewage system,
 a  septic  tank  serves  each separate
 dwelling.                             </content>
