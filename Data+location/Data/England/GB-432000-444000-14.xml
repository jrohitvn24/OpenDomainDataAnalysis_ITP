 WAS BUILT IN 1810.THERE ARE 20 LETTING
 BEDROOMS AND THE HOTEL IS OPEN TO     
 NON-RESIDENTS.DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS
 IT IS BUSY WITH TOURISTS,AND DURING   
 THE WINTER MONTHS IS USED BY          
 BUSINESSMEN.IN THE COURTYARD AT THE   
 BACK YOU CAN SEE STABLES WHERE 40     
 HORSES COULD HAVE BEEN KEPT.100 YEARS 
 AGO UP TO 22 COACHES A DAY CALLED AT  
 THE ARMS BUT BY 1859 THIS WAS REDUCED 
 TO 1 WITH THE COMING OF THE RAILWAYS. 
 A BLACKSMITH IN THE VILLAGE HAS BEEN  
 REPLACED BY A GARAGE SELLING PETROL.

 REFURBISHED.
