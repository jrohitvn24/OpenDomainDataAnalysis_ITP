		<content> The doctor's surgery is in another    
 village about a mile and a quarter    
 distant and is staffed by three       
 practitioners who are on duty         
 alternately.   For those who cannot   
 attend the surgery by appointment one 
 or other of the doctors does a        
 visiting round.   Prescriptions are   
 dispensed from the doctor's surgery   
 and a chiropodist attends at the      
 surgery weekly.                       
 A District Nurse lives in Cattistock  
 in a house provided by the Health     
 Authority for such a nurse.           
 The nearest hospital is about nine    
 miles away in Dorchester and has a    
 Maternity Unit but no Casualty        
 Department.   The nearest Casualty    
 Department is about 12 miles away at  
 Yeovil.   A Home Help Service and     
 Meals on Wheels are also available.
