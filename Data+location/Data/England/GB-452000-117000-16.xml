		<title>16DOCTORS' SURGERY</title>
		<content>   The new doctors' surgery in Lower   
 Lane was built on the site of an old  
 Congregational Church and was         
 completed in 1981. There are{five     
{doctors}in the practice (all with     
 their own room) and other staff       
 including three{district nurses,}a    
 district{midwife,}two{health visitors,
 as well as several receptionists.     
   Patients live within a{five mile    
{radius}of Bishops Waltham. The doctors
 work in the surgery and go out to     
 calls on a rota system. Nowadays      
 there is an{appointment system}at the 
 surgery and usually patients can be   
 seen by one of the doctors the same   
 day they ring in. Various{clinics}are 
 held there such as the Ante-natal     
 Clinic.
