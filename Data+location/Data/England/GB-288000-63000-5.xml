		<content> I belong to a Brownie Club in Shiphay.
 I go to it on Mondays from 6:00 to    
 7:30pm. We do badge work. The badges  
 we get have little pictures according 
 to the activity. We have a Tawny Owl, 
 a Brown Owl and a Snowy Owl who are   
 our leaders. The Brown Owl is the most
 important person because she is in    
 charge. We have four groups called    
 sixes: Sprites, Pixies, Elves and     
 Gnomes. I am the sixer (leader) of the
 Gnomes. When little children join     
 Brownies we have a rolling up session.
 Here we have a mirror and a child goes
 round the mirror saying "Twist me and 
 turn me and show me the owl, I looked 
 in the water and there stood myself." 
 I promise that I will do my best, to  
 do my duty to God, to serve the Queen 
 to help other people and to keep the  
 Brownie Guide Law.
