 Hemsford was a mixed live-stock farm  
 until 4 years ago when it was         
 converted to a holiday centre.  There 
 are 11 two-storey holiday cottages and
 4 one-storey cottages.  Hemsford has  
 fishing amenities in its own pond.    
 There is a coin operated laundry, a   
 daily milk and paper delivery and shop
 for "topping-up" on essentials.  Pets 
 are not allowed at Hemsford.  The     
 cottages have a colour TV, two        
 bedrooms, and lounge and a kitchen.   
 Hemsford provides riding for the      
 visitors and public.  They have an    
 outdoor school, they also take rides  
 round the lanes for the complete      
 beginner, novice and expert.  There is
 also a heated indoor swimming pool, a 
 sauna, solarium, gym, tennis court and
 9-hole approach golf-course, and a    
 play area for residents.              </content>
