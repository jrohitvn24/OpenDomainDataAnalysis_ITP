		<title>06NATIONAL TRUST NATURE TRAIL</title>
		<content>     From Blackdown you can see to the 
 South the chalk South Down, and       
 Chanctonbury Ring. On a clear day you 
 can see the sea.                      
     On the Nature trail there are some
 areas of interest. There are some dew 
 ponds or bog pools. The bog mosses    
 grow in loose tussocks and can take in
 large amounts of water. In World War I
 they were collected and used in       
 dressings.                            
     A small path, known as Pen Y Bos  
 (an old Celtic name) is an ancient    
 track. Earlier still, Mesolithic Man  
 lived here about 6000 BC.             
     Another place of interest is      
 called the Temple of the Winds, a     
 group of trees at the Southern end of 
 Blackdown much loved by Lord Tennyson.
 In the 17th Century there was a beacon
 here, and in the 18th Century a       
 telegraph.                            </content>
