		<content>Our area covers the NW and mid-central 
section of Corby, with Rockingham      
Estate farmland to the West, and       
Cottingham village. The urban area is  
post-war (1945) Council housing, built 
when Corby was a booming steel town    
1933-7. Over half the population is    
Scottish (Glaswegian). Closure of      
quarries and iron-steel making plants  
made 7000 of the 12000 work force      
redundant (Tube Works now import steel 
strip). Council plus Government/EEC    
grants created new industrial areas    
reducing 24% unemployment to 18%. Rural
Northants considers Corby socially and 
culturally down-market, for this 2nd   
biggest town still carries its early,  
but not now deserved, rough working-   
class image. It is a town slowly       
changing its image. Its people are     
friendly and proud of Corby.
