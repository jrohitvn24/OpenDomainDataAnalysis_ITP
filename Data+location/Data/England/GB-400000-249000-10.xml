		<content>     The only church in this           
 area is All Saints. A church on this  
 site was mentioned in the original    
 Domesday Book. It was replaced by a   
 Norman church. The fourteenth century 
 tower with pinnacles is included in   
 the national list of "buildings of    
 architectural interest". One of the   
 original bells, No.5,still calls the  
 congregation to worship. It has the   
 inscription "GEVEF THANKS TO GOD" and 
 is also inscribed wih the names of the
 churchwardens in 1600.                
    The churchyard is very welcoming   
 and local people have generously given
 their time and skill to preserve the  
 fabric of the building and surrounds. 
    The average Sunday morning         
 congregation is 45. There is a full   
 range of study groups for all ages.   
    Atch Lench has a Baptist Church    
 built in 1820.                        </content>
