		<title>17THE ARNCLIFFE ESTATE</title>
		<content>   The Lindley Park estate, more       
 commonly known as the{Arncliffe       
{Estate,}is just a few steps away from 
 the busy New Hey Road. It was begun to
 be built in the mid 1970's and        
 finished in 1981, although the latest 
 addition was completed in 1984.       
  To one side of the estate is Low     
 Hills Field which is owned by a farmer
 who lives in{The Gatehouse,}an old    
 house which is about 200 years old.   
 There is a network of blocked wells,  
 all connected by tunnels which lead to
 a small marshy pond in the centre of  
 the field.                            
  The other side of the estate is more 
 industrial; there is{Highfield Funeral
{Services}factory where coffins are    
 manufactured and further down the road
 is the{Wellington Cloth Mill,}opened  
 in the 1800's.
