		<content>  One out of four people thought that  
 Longfield shops did not serve their   
 needs but all 4 people went into the  
 nearest town to buy cloths.Out of     
 these people 2 came twice a week 1    
 came 4 times a week and the other came
 every day.On average 1 out of 5 people
 that came to the shop were men,mostly 
 it was women coming to do shopping for
 food.All the people that came to these
 shops came from Longfield hill and    
 lived only a few houses away 3 out of 
 4 people lived near enough to the     
 shops for their journey to take two   
 minutes but the other persons journey 
 took 5 minutes.All the people we asked
 had walked to the shops so perhaps the
 families did not have a car and so    
 therefore probably took the bus,from  
 Meopham or Longfield to the town.
