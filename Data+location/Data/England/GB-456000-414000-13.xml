		<title>13THE WILDLIFE AROUND FENWICK</title>
		<content> This area is flat{farmland.}There are 
 few woods and many hedgerows have been
 taken out. Therefore the{animals}have 
 few places to hide. The animals found 
 in this area are, rabbits, hares,     
 pheasants, partridges, voles and all  
 kinds of mice.{Swifts}can be seen near
 the lake and the remaining wetland. In
 one dyke there is the only remaning   
 bed of{yellow irises}to be found in   
 the area. The ruined brickworks are   
 turning into a haven for many{wild    
{flowers}as well as owls and bats in   
 the ruined chimneys. Along the verges 
 of the narrow country roads poppies   
 and ox-eye daisies can still be seen.
