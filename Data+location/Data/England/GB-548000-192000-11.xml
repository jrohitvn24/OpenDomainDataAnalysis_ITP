		<title>11Our Journey.</title>
		<content> We left school at about 1.15 pm and   
 walked towards Lower Park Farm.We     
 turned into an area of wasteland and  
 saw lots of Hawthorn trees.           
 Lots of us stroked the foal but were  
 told to stop in case we were attacked 
 by the mare.                          
                                       
 We then walked toward Havering Country
 Park.The forest was hugh and before we
 entered it we sketched the view.      
                                       
 The forest floor was very rough and   
 dusty.There were lots of different    
 trees and a variety of wild flowers.  
                                       
 We arrived at the village half an hour
 later and looked around the graveyard 
 and bell tower.
