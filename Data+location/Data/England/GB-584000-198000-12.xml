 In talking with Mrs Smith,who is in   
 charge of the Post office,we found out
 that it is 35 years old and that she  
 had been there for 20 of those years, 
 having moved from London to Cold      
 Norton.She also said that she enjoyed 
 running the post office.Before 1950   
 the post office used to be situated a 
 few yards away at what is now a       
 private house.                        
{What We Use the Post Office For.}     
 or the most part we use the Post      
 Office for sending letters and parcels
 or for buying stamps and Postal       
 Orders.Older people in the village are
 able to claim their pensions at the   
 Post Office once a week. The Post     
 Office also operates as a shop and    
 sells vasrious sweets and stationery  
 items.                                
                                       </content>
