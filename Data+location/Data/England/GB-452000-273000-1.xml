		<title>01Rugby Radio Station</title>
		<content>   Rugby Radio Station was designed and
 built by engineers of the Wireless    
 Section of the Post Office Engineering
 Department in the 1920s. Regular      
 transmission began on January 1st when
 messages were broadcast in morse code.
 It made history. As well as the G.B.R.
 call sign it also broadcast the       
 Greenwich Time Signal at certain times
 of the day.                           
                                       
   In war time, both were heard by     
 British vessels from warship to       
 submarine. On January 7th 1927 the    
 telephone service opened to give the  
 first long distance radio telephone   
 service in the world and connected    
 ordinary public telephone users. The  
 tallest radio mast is 820 ft.
