		<title>12THE FOSSWAY NEAR CRUDWELL</title>
		<content> The Fossway was{a Roman road.}It was  
 called the Fossway because of the{deep
{fossae or ditches}next to the road    
 from which the building materials were
 dug.The Romans usually built their    
 roads straight but if they came to a  
 hill or mountain they would build     
 round it.In this area the Fossway is  
{now a public footpath.}It runs        
 diagonally through the area for about 
 2\ miles.The public are allowed to    
 walk along the Fossway and there are  
 several places where it is possible to
 have a{picnic.}There are lots of{wild 
{flowers}such as bluebells and cowslips
 and many{wild animals}live there.You  
 may ride along the old road on        
{horseback.}The Fossway is rough in    
 some places and after rain it is very 
 muddy.{Walking along the Fossway is   
{very enjoyable.
