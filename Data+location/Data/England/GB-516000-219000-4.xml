		<content> WATERCRESS BEDS cont.                 
  The watercress takes from seed eight 
 weeks to grow and the colour of the   
 seed is brown and orange.             
  At the springs we lifted the lid up  
 which had a brick over it and there   
 was water flowing.Then we walked along
 a track and pushed the trolley and saw
 Mr.Sansom and asked him what he was   
 doing and he was clearing weed out of 
 the water.After that we walked through
 the clean water back to the house.They
 said that the temperature of the water
 was the same all the year round.      
  We asked them if they liked the hours
 they work and they said they work     
 eleven hours a day and it was hard    
 work but gave great satisfaction.
