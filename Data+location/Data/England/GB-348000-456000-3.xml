		<content> When this farmer started farming 50   
 years ago he had 70 acres and now he  
 has 119 acres. Originally he had no   
 electricity but the cable was laid in 
 1930. Their water was all from natural
 springs but now they are on the main  
 water supply.50 years ago cattle were 
 milked by hand in sheds now machines  
 in milking parlours are used. The     
 increase in milk yield over the last  
 30 years is 200 gallons per cow pa.   
 This farmer still bottles his own     
 milk. This is unusual as most farmers 
 have their milk collected each day by 
 tanker &amp; bottled in a central dairy in
 Lancaster.50 years ago they took hay  
 from the fields but now use silage.   
 Recreation 50 years ago was church    
 meetings &amp; occasional visits to the   
 picture houses. He now has 5 tractors 
 not 1, and lives in a modern          
 bungalow not the old stone farmhouse. </content>
