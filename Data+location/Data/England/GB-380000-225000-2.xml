		<title>02ARTS AND CRAFTS:ASHLEWORTH</title>
		<content> Many crafts  are to be found in the   
 area of our survey.Younger folk seem  
 more interested in{television }and    
 outdoor pursuits than art and craft.  
 However there is evidence that once   
 people are married they become more   
 resourceful &amp; develop an interest     
 in creative pursuits. Locally these   
 include:                              
         Painting    Wood Carving      
         Knitting    Crochet           
         Dressmaking Flower Arranging  
         Pottery     Embroidery        
         Cookery     Jewellery Making  
         Flower pressing Enamelling    
         Wine Making Photography       
 Patchwork Quilts have been very       
 popular.The{Women's Institute}has made
 several and the{School}also made one  
 which was sold to raise money for     
 school funds.
