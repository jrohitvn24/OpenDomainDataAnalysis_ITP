		<title>02SHUGBOROUGH HALL</title>
		<content>  Shugborough Estate was bought by     
William Anson in 1623.  Thomas Anson   
later built on the flanking pavillions.
  The National Trust has owned         
Shugborough since 1960.  There are 18  
acres of formal gardens around the     
house which are a major tourist        
attraction in this area.  Over 80,000  
people visit Shugborough each year.    
  The Queen and other members of the   
Royal Family,as well as many pop-stars 
have visited the house.  We wonder if  
any of them have met Lady Harriet,the  
family ghost.                          
  Shugborough has approximately 130    
rooms,many are in the cellar.  Lord    
Lichfield's family have 45 rooms in    
their private quarters.                
  In the 9 rooms open to the public    
there are priceless antiques which give
a clear view of the life-style of      
wealthy people in Georgian times.      </content>
