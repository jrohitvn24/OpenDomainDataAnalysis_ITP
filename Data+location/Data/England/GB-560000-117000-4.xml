		<title>04Occupations in Warbleton</title>
		<content> Although Warbleton is a rural area    
 only a small minority of families     
 depend on the land, as farmers, game- 
 keepers or horticulturalists, for     
 their livelihood. These are often the 
 ones whose families have lived in the 
 area for many generations. Warbleton  
 has become a residential area for     
 people with a wide range of           
 occupations. Some are unskilled       
 workers, but there are several self-  
 employed skilled workers such as      
 plumbers, builders or sweeps. In      
 addition there are businessmen, social
 workers, teachers, professors, doctors
 and surgeons. Many travel some        
 distance to work, a few even as far as
 London. Unemployment is not a problem 
 in this area but it is a home for many
 retired people.
