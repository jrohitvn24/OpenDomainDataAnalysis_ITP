		<title>18LOCAL ISSUES: EDUCATION.</title>
		<content> The local issue which caused the most 
 public interest in June 1985 concerned
 the future of the William Farr        
 Comprehensive School. Due to falling  
 pupil rolls and Central Government    
 spending cut-backs the Lincolnshire   
 Education Committee has formed a 'Task
 Group' which is visiting all schools  
 in the County to gather infomation and
 allow local people to make suggestions
 for the future of Education within    
 their local areas. These suggestions  
 will then be made into a report which 
 will be put before the Council for    
 action.                               
 For this purpose, the William Farr    
 School and Cherry Willingham School   
 were looked at together - this created
 fears that the two schools were to be 
 joined in some way either by          
 'Federation' or a split site school;  
 both deemed to be unsatisfactory.     </content>
