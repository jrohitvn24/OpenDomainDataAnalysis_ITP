		<title>03Tilwick Meadow</title>
		<content> Near the ruined Manor House at Tilwick
 there is a medieval meadow which the  
 farmer is not allowed to plough.In    
 April the meadow looks very beautiful 
 for there are lots of yellow cowslips 
 in bloom.Later on in June rare orchids
 flower.In the fields nearby some      
 interesting archeological discoveries 
 have been made.Pottery and iron slag  
 have been found.The Roman pottery     
 ranges from the 1st to the 4th        
 centuries.It is mostly beige and it is
 not glazed.The medieval pottery dates 
 from the 11th to the 14th centuries   
 and has a jade green glaze.We know    
 that there were iron works here in    
 Roman times because lumps of spongey  
 slag and tap slag have been found.The 
 iron ore was brought here from        
 Northamptonshire because there were   
 many woodlands here to provide fuel   
 for smelting.                         </content>
