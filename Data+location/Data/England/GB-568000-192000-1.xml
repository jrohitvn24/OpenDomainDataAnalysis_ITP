		<content> Our area has four distinct regions    
 each with shops, a church, school, and
 public houses.It is a pleasant place  
 to live because it is surrounded by   
 farmland and woods, yet is close to   
 London and the coast. The older houses
 have large gardens and the housing    
 estates are well set out, with open   
 spaces and trees. The council owned   
 properties were built after the second
 world war for families from London.   
 The nearest railway is Billericay with
 frequent fast services to Liverpool   
 Street and Southend and conections to 
 East Anglia. The M.25 is twenty       
 minutes drive away. Most people work  
 outside the area. Primary school      
 children find plenty to do, with      
 scouting organisations, sports clubs  
 and fields and woods to play in.      
 Teenagers complain, that there is     
 nothing to do but visit pubs.         </content>
