		<content>{Bucks Hill House,}two miles east of   
 Sarratt, is the West Hertfordshire    
 Agricultural Management Centre, part  
 of Watford College Management Studies 
 Department. It was opened on October 9
 1968 by John Davies, then head of the 
 C.B.I. It is used for short courses on
 agricultural topics. Formerly it was a
 turkey farm owned by a Mrs Bell. In   
 the grounds there used to be some     
 stables and a shelter for coach and   
 horses. The latter is now a garage.   
 A giant redwood tree once stood in the
 grounds and could be seen from        
 Sarratt. It was sadly struck down by  
 lightning. There is a horsechestnut   
 tree in the grounds which has been    
 grafted and now produces pink AND     
 white blossom through the spring and  
 summer.
