		<content> To the North East of Copplestone area 
 lies the village of Newbuildings. In  
 this year 1985 there are roughly 70   
 people and 27 houses in the           
 Newbuildings square.  There are two   
 garages and no shops.  Four years ago 
 there was a shop which sold a few     
 things but now is closed.  There      
 is a playground with swings, a        
 roundabout and a football pitch. There
 is also a church which is used once a 
 month.  The service is held by        
 Charles Edwards.  The church used to  
 be a school.  In 1773 a Mr.John Ham   
 following the will of his brother     
 Reverent Robert Ham who died in       
 1770, paid one pound ten shillings    
 to a school master to teach the poor  
 children of Newbuildings. The present 
 building dates back to 1875, but was  
 closed down as a school a few years   
 ago.                                  </content>
