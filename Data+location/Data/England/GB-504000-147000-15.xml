		<title>15LOCAL EVENTS IN SHERE</title>
		<content>   There are several annual events in  
 which many villagers take part each   
 year.                                 
   On Palm Sunday we go to Church to   
 sing and a donkey comes. The year     
 before Belinda,the donkey,was getting 
 very fat,she was going to have a baby.
 We go around the village singing and  
 Belinda leads the way with some one   
 riding her.                           
   Every year in Shere we have a Pram  
 Race. It has been going on for 12     
 years. There is a prize for the best  
 dressed and a prize for the winning   
 team. They go through the ford,over   
 the stile and through another ford and
 through the woods and back to Shere.  
 There are six in a team, five push and
 one goes in the pram. The teams are   
 sponsored and the money goes to       
 Charity.
