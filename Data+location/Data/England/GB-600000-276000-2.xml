		<content>The area is predominantly flat with    
slight undulations, lying between 48   
and 24 metres above sea-level. Being   
mainly arable farmland, the fields are 
mostly large and open with very few    
trees or hedges. Apart from a few      
solitary trees with preservation orders
on them, what trees and hedges there   
are, are mainly around the houses and  
their enclosed meadows. There is one   
stretch of fenland adjoining the small 
river Ouse which supports some small   
trees as well as shrubs and some       
wildlife. This area of fen, which is a 
mixture of wet land and sandy soil is  
common land. Just in this block on the 
Northern edge stands Thelnetham        
windmill, an old post mill which has   
recently been renovated, and is now    
again grinding corn, using wind power.
