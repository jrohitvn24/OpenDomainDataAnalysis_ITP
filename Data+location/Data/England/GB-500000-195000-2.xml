		<title>02A Day at the Russell School</title>
		<content>   At 7:45 on Thursday 23rd May 1985 I 
woke up for a school day. First I got  
into my uniform. After which I had a   
wash and some breakfast. Then I checked
that I had everything for school. 08:30
I was driven from Chalfont St Giles to 
Chorleywood Russell School. 09:30 The  
whistle was blown and all classes lined
up to be called in. 09:05 The register 
was called. My first lesson was        
Needlework where I was being taught to 
hem a tray cloth. 10:40 At breaktime   
my friends and I went on the field.    
10:55 I went to line up ready for      
swimming. When the coach arrived we got
on it to go to Amersham to take my gold
survival. 11:10 We travelled back to   
school and I ate my sandwiches. 12:40 I
went onto the field until 13:10. For   
the rest of the afternoon we rehearsed 
for the school performance "THE MIKADO"
which will be performed in July.       </content>
