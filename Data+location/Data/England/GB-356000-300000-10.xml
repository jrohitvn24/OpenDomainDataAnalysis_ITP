		<title>10     HARNAGE GRANGE</title>
		<content>   Harnage Grange is a very large      
 working farm owned by Mr.Scott.  Monks
 associated with Buildwas Abbey        
 originally had the farm.  Now the farm
 involves work with both crops and     
 animals.  The main animals kept are   
 sheep, cows, pheasants and bees.      
 Pheasants are bred for food and for   
 sport, this being one of Mr. Scott's  
 hobbies.  Rings are kept on the bird's
 beaks in order to prevent them from   
 pecking out their feathers.  Electric 
 lamps are used to keep the chicks     
 warm.                                 
   Two varieties of honey from bees fed
 entirely on rape seed flowers. This   
 honey solidifies rapidly if not       
 collected at the earliest opportunity.
  The rape honey was tasted and found  
 to be very palatable.
