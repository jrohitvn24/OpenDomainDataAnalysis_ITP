		<content> Dunscar Fold Farm is the oldest       
 building  in the area and was built in
 the 1600's during the reign of James  
 I.It was built from local sandstone   
 from the local Cox Green quarries,    
 along with other cottages in the      
 area.Tongfields has some weavers      
 cottages built in 1797.Local weavers  
 worked on their looms in the cellars. 
 In the 1800's houses were built along 
 Darwen Rd,at that time,the main Bolton
 to Blackburn road.Mainly,the terraced 
 cottages were made from sandstone and 
 with slated  roofs.There was very     
 little housing development until the  
 1960's and many different housing     
 estates have been built of bungalows  
 made from brick or wooden structures. 
 The last of the housing was completed 
 in 1984.
