		<title>12TRANSPORT - HEDINGHAM</title>
		<content>   There is little public transport, no
 trains within a 10-mile radius, and a 
 limited local bus service. This       
 provides buses to local market towns  
 daily and some services in the early  
 morning in time for work. There is    
 also a service called the Country Car 
 which runs by appointment in the      
 evenings to nearby towns. There are   
 two daily long-distance services which
 go through the villages, one to London
 from Sudbury and one from Clacton to  
 Cambridge.                            
   There is a private hire mini-bus    
 firm in the village which employs 18  
 people and has 12 vehicles for hire.  
 The firm caters mainly for regular    
 contract work for schools and local   
 industry all over Essex and Suffolk.
