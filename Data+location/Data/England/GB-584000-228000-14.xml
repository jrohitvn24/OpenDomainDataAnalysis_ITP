		<title>14FARMING IN EARLS COLNE</title>
		<content> Earls Colne has a large amount of     
 farmland in and around it.The farmland
 is mainly used to grow cereal crops,  
 like oats,wheat and barley.The fields 
 that are used as cereal crops are big 
 but not massive.There is also quite a 
 lot of land used as pasture but not a 
 lot of livestock farming.             
             Mr Bull is one of the few 
 dairy farmers in Earls Colne.His herd 
 consists of about fifty Friesian      
 cattle.He also has a herd of about    
 thirty Canborough Blue sows.He has    
 about 120 acres of land,half is used  
 for pasture land and the remainder    
 for cereal crops.
