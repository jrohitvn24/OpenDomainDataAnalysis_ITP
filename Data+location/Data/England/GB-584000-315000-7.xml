		<content>  There is a lack of{communications}as 
 the vast majority of this area has no 
 bus service at all.People have to     
 travel out of the block to find any   
 form of public{transport. }Because of 
 this,a high proportion of families who
 reside in this area run their own     
 car.For those who do not rural        
 isolation is an acute problem         
 affecting their{life styles}          
 especially, during the winter         
 months.School children from the       
 Lexhams are bussed daily,into and out 
 of Litcham which is the{education }   
 centre for the Lexhams.Those from the 
 edge of Great Dunham are near enough  
 to walk to their primary school,or    
 catch a school bus to Litcham High    
 School.
