		<title>13Arable Farm 2:The Deverills</title>
		<content> There are four peak periods in the    
 farming year at{Woodcombe Farm.}In the
 autumn the farmer ploughs and sows the
 winter wheat, in the winter he sows   
 the spring barley. Early summer is    
 busy with silage-making, a first and  
 usually a second cut, and the busiest 
 time of all, harvest-time. Throughout 
 the year the farmer top dresses the   
 crops and grass ley with nitrogen.    
 Woodcombe Farm is an old farmhouse,   
 built around 175O, with large modern  
 barns and the most up-to-date farming 
 equipment. The farm is very mechanised
 with four tractors, and all its own   
 equipment, from combine-harvester to  
 silage trailers.Twenty years ago the  
 farm grew 80-100 acres of corn, the   
 acreage of cereals has increased ,and 
 also the yield per acre due to the    
 greater use of chemicals to control   
 weeds and fertilise crops.            </content>
