 Two{schools}in these villages, and an 
 old Chapel have been converted into   
 houses.The{oldest}house in the area is
{Hankerton Manor Farm}which is in the  
 original Domesday Book.Like the Church
 and the old vicarage ,it is said to be
 haunted. In Hankerton there is an     
 estate of 36 modern houses.           
       Three years ago money was       
 raised to build the{new village hall  
 in Charlton. It was built on the site 
 leased by Lord Suffolk in return for  
 a{peppercorn rent of Â£1 p.a..         
 The site includes a large             
 recreational area which is used by    
 cricket,football and rugger teams     
 and also provides a play area for     
 younger children.
