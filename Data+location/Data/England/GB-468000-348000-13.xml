		<title>13REASONS FOR LIVING LOCALLY</title>
		<content>  With most work being outside the     
 villages,what brought the people here 
 and how long ago?                     
   Using the small sample of the       
 families of a class of children it is 
 surprising that only 4 out of 26 have 
 been here more than 19 years and 18   
 have been here less than 15 years.For 
 the vast majority of households these 
 are{dormitory villages.}              
   The{wage earner's job}is the unsur- 
 prising reason for most villagers     
 moving into the area.                 
   But why especially{Thurgarton}and{  
{Bleasby?}5 said they liked the village
 and 4 said they liked the house.6     
 liked the house and the village whilst
 3 came for the house and the job      
 (including the vicar!)                
   2 came to be near relatives whilst 1
 came in to buy a pig farm and another 
 to convert a barn into a house.       </content>
