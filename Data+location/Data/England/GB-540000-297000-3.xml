		<title>03Types of Housing in March.</title>
		<content>  By the{River}Nene,in{West End,}there}
 is a{modern detached house}built in   
 the{Dutch style,}and also a Dutch     
 style cottage called{Vandermoyden     
{Cottage}which has the{date MDCXCV}    
 (1695) on it. This is probably the    
 oldest house in our 'block'.We feel   
 this is a clear reminder of the       
 draining of the Fens by the{Dutch     
{engineers.                            
  There is a{hostel for mentally       
{handicapped people in Elm Road, which 
 is a modern building.                 
  There are some{bungalows}called Swan 
 Court,which are for{elderly people.   
 There was once a maternity home in    
 March,but it is now a home for elderly
 people.Also for old people were some  
{flats}which we discovered in{St.John's
{Chase.                                
  We even have well-established{caravan
{homes}in{Robingoodfellows Lane.       </content>
