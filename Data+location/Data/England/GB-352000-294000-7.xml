		<title>07A FARMER'S WIFE IN PLAISH</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
    Many older farmers believe that    
 farmer's sons should marry farmer's   
 daughters. Not fitting into this      
 category, I often think they may be   
 right. As a family business it has    
 it's ups and downs and money is short 
 as it is all ploughed back into the   
 business. It can also be very lonely, 
 that is when I'm not inundated with   
 temporary work-hands demanding meals, 
 or piles of sandwiches and cups of    
 tea. Shopping is also rather a chore  
 and requires a little planning as the 
 nearest shop is 8 miles away.         
    It is truly a rare occasion when we
 go out together for the day, but      
 despite all of this we would not swap 
 the fresh air and sunny days we enjoy 
 for anything else.
