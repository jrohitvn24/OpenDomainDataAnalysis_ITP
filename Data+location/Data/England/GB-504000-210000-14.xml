		<content> In Grovehill there is a BMX track.    
 BMX stands for{Bicycle Motor Cross.   
 There is a starting gate at the top of
 the ramp.  The starter calls "This    
 time!", "Riders ready!", "Pedals      
 ready!" "Go!".  You race round a      
 track, over jumps and into ditches.   
    There are{different types of jumps 
  ie. Speed jump, whoops (which are two
 bumps together), a burm, a bomb hole  
 (which is a ditch) and a table top.

   Members are charged 50 pence (non-  
 members 75 pence) to take part in a   
 race meeting.  A BMX bicycle can cost 
 from around Â£60 to Â£700.  You need    
 protective gear to race, including    
 helmets, padded trousers and top.     
   There are monthly race meetings on  
 Sundays which are open to everyone.   
 People come from all over London and  
 the Midlands.                         </content>
