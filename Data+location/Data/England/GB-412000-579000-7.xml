		<content> Originally spelt Linn Law which means 
 hill of water (there are 5 natural    
 springs on the farm) it is now owned  
 by Bob and Rita Forsyth who bought the
 farm in l979. It extends to 200 acres 
 of which 110 acres are arable growing 
 winter barley,oats and turnips. The   
 remainder being used for pasture and  
 hay. This year they produced 3,000    
 bales of hay for winter feed. There   
 are 150 Suffolk X ewes, 3 rams and 100
 black-face hogs being fattened for    
 market. There are also 70-80 Charolais
 -Hereford stirks which are bought in  
 at 3-6months and sent to market at    
 10-12months.The farm is run by Bob and
 his son with casual help at harvest   
 time. They own 3 tractors and a       
 combine-harvester. Dutch elm disease  
 has killed 16 trees on the farm but   
 there are no immediate plans to       
 replace them.                         </content>
