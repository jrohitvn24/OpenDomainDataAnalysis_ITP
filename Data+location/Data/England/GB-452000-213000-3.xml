Although only part of Otmoor is covered
in the area of the 12 map squares it   
will be treated as a whole.Within      
living memory it was still a fen,but   
much of it has now been drained by the 
farmers and sown with cereals.There is 
still a wild area in the danger area of
the Rifle Range and parts of it are    
designated as sites of special         
scientific interest.It is for instance 
the habitat of one of the few remaining
colonies of the Marsh Fritillary       
butterfly.It still supports a good     
wildlife population and a bird species 
count made recently compares favourably
with one made 50 years ago.In 1830     
there were riots over the              
enclosures.Yeomanry sent to quell the  
riots marched their prisoners through  
St Giles's Fair where they were        
promptly freed by the populace!        </content>
