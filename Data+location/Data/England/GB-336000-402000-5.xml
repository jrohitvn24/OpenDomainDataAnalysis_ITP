		<title>05The Canal Today</title>
		<content> Sefton Council has a plan to develop  
 the canal and its towpaths as a local 
 amenity.In conjunction with a         
 government urban aid programme the    
 concil and British Waterways are      
 investigating schemes to improve canal
 side buildings and to landscape the   
 towpaths.Work has already begun near  
 the bridge at Bells Lane,Lydiate.     
         The canal is already well used
 by narrowboat enthusiasts and there is
 a boating club in Lydiate.During the  
 fishing season the towpaths  are      
 crowded by local enthusiasts and many 
 others from the surrounding area.Kenny
 Madine,a 2nd year pupil at Maghull    
 High School,describes the trials and  
 tribulations of canal fishing on the  
 following page.
