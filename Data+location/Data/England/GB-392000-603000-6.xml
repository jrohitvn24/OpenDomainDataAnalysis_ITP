		<content> Harbottle Castle                      
                                       
 Harbottle Castle is now in ruins.     
 The only parts that are clearly seen  
 are the keep and some of the walls.   
   It is now about 1000 years old. The 
 first castle would probably be of wood
 with a fence round it.Then it would be
 made of stone.                        
       During the 17th and 18th        
 Centuries the old castle was taken    
 down and the stone used to build the  
 new castle which still exists,but     
 added to over the years.              
       The castle is now in a dangerous
 state and is not open to the public   
 like many other famous castles. It is 
 on private land.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
