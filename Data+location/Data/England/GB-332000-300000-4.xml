In the summer members can enjoy        
rounders,cricket and football in the   
adjacent school field.                 
Outings are organised throughout the   
year.Ice skating in Telford is a       
favourite, along with roller skating   
and visits to a safari park and of     
course a pantomime visit at Christmas.
