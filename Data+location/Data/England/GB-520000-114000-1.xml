		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>   The village of Henfield lies on a   
 low greensand ridge.It does not rise  
 more than 150feet above sea-level.It  
 is a fertile ridge with plenty of     
 springs but the area is well drained. 
 The sandy soil makes it a good area   
 for growing so there are farms and    
 market gardens.There are some lovely  
 views of the South Downs.             
   The village is constantly growing.  
 New residential areas blend with the  
 older historic houses.                
   There is a Primary School, library, 
 Health Centre and a Dentist.There are 
 several places of worship, a historic 
 C.of E. Church, a modern R.C. Church, 
 a Free Evangelical Church and a       
 Rehobath Baptist Chapel.              
   There are plenty of Clubs and       
 Societies to join  for both adults and
 children. The area is administered by 
 the Henfield Parish Council.          </content>
