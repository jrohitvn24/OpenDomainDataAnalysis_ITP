		<content>   The first recorded church of        
 Wroughton was in 956 AD. It was       
 dedicated to St.Helena who became     
 popular in the middle ages, because   
 she was reputed to find Christ's cross
 at Calvary.                           
    The North aisle and tower were     
 built in 1380 AD along with the       
 chancel. The tower was built in 3     
 stages. The first stage supports the  
 other stages with angled butteresses. 
   There are two animal gargoyles      
 either side of the church below the   
 tower battlements. The tower is sixty 
 feet tall and the internal dimemsions 
 are 17'5" x 15'5". In 1905 the North  
 tower was completely restored and in  
 1906 a new piece of masonry was added 
 under the battlements on the West side
 of the church.
