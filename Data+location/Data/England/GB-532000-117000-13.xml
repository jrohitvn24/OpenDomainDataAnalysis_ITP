		<title>13Keymer Brick Works Bur. Hill</title>
		<content> This is marked on the Ordnance Survey 
 Map as a brickworks but makes only    
 tiles now. The clay is dug up from the
 pits which are next to the works and  
 comes to the mill on a conveyor belt. 
 Here the clay goes into a mixing pan  
 where it is mixed with water. Next it 
 goes into a machine that makes it into
 'bats', which are bits of clay that   
 are cut up into strips.  These are put
 into a room to be dried. When they are
 nearly solid they are 'biddled', which
 means they are hit with pieces of wood
 to put them into their proper shape.  
 Then the tiles are put into a small   
 room with a fan that dries them       
 completely.  They are then put into a 
 kiln which is where they are baked    
 until they are solid. There has       
 recently been debate about whether to 
 make old clay pits into rubbish dumps 
 or a golf course.                     </content>
