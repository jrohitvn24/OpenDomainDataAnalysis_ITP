		<title>18Morwenstow - A Child's Day</title>
		<content> I woke at 7:30, had a wash and cleaned
 my teeth. Then I had breakfast and got
 dressed.                              
 I walked  down  to  Emma's  place  and
 waited for the  car that  takes  me to
 school. On the way I saw a pheasant in
 the hedge; it was so bright!          
 At school I talked to my friends for a
 while then at 9:00 the  bell rang  and
 we started  lessons.                  
 My  first  lesson was  Maths and I had
 to make some pyramids.                
 Break was at 10:45. I ate my lunch and
 played football with my friends. After
 break I had English,a good story about
 climbing Everset. After dinner I play-
 football and then had Nature Study in 
 the shrubbery. There was another play-
 time in the  afternoon.  Afterwards  I
 swam in the  school  pool  and  then I
 went home at 3:30.
