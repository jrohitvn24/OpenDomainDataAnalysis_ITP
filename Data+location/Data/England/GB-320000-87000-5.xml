		<title>05BEER QUARRY CAVES AND MUSEUM</title>
		<content>{Beer Quarry Caves}have recently       
 reopened. Thousands of people come to 
 have a look at the famous limestone.  
 The quarries are said to be nearly    
 two thousand years old ,dating from   
 Roman times.                          
 The cave is supported  by limestone   
 pillars.                              
 The stone was used for churches like  
 ST.Pauls cathedral and Exeter         
 Cathedral and Norwich Roman Catholic  
 Cathedral. It has also been used for  
 some famous houses. The masons        
 preferred Beer stone because it was   
 easy to cut and when air got to it,it 
 hardened up. The colour of the stone  
 is a creamy white. Beer Quarry caves  
 were carved and dug out by hand and   
 then the large blocks of stone were   
 transported by horse and cart.
