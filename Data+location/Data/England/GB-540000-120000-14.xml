		<title>14MY SCHOOL DAY Part 2</title>
		<content> In the afternoon, we do topic work    
 which I love. We find out about all   
 sorts of things. We see films, go on  
 visits, have people come to talk to   
 us, use computer programs and books to
 do this work. Some afternoons we do   
 games or P.E. and usually do some art 
 work. We go home at 3.45 p.m.         
 When I get home I like to play outside
 with my friends until dinner is ready.
 One evening a week I go to guides     
 where we play games and do work for   
 badges. If I stay at home, I watch the
 television, play on my computer or    
 read a book. Sometimes I play a card  
 game with my brother.                 
 At 9.00 p.m. I have a drink and go up 
 to bed. I have my own room which I    
 have decorated with lots of pictures  
 of the pop group Wham! I usually read 
 for a while before I go to sleep.
