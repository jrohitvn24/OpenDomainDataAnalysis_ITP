		<title>11STOPSLEY JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The age range is from 2 to 11 years   
 and most of the children walk to      
 school as they live in the Stopsley   
 area. Some parents held a jewellery   
 party and raised enough money for     
 tracksuits and netball kit. Sports    
 equipment costs Â£150 p.a. and crash   
 mats cost Â£50 each. The school has a  
 small field for sports and also uses  
 the nearby Regional Sports Centre for 
 football. The school has ten teachers 
 plus the headmaster. Two of the       
 teachers are supply teachers. There   
 are nine classrooms in the school     
 altogether. There are just over two   
 hundred pupils in the school which is 
 a mixed school.
