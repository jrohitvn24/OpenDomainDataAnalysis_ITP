 enabling people to meet socially &amp;    
 often as the only local source of     
 entertainment. Dennington has a Sports
 Club with its own sports field, an    
 Over 60's Club, a Children's Church   
 Club &amp; a Women's Institute. Badingham 
 village hall is the meeting place for 
 their Women's Institute, the Youth    
 Club, Brownies, Autumn Leaves &amp;       
 fortnightly whist drives. A bowls club
 adjoins the White Horse. Most adults  
 in Badingham belong to Badingham      
 Community Council &amp; elect an Executive
 Committee annually. They run regular  
 events such as the Harvest Supper,    
 Summer Fete, Bonfire &amp; children's     
 Christmas parties and finance &amp;       
 distribute free to all residents a    
 bi-monthly magazine "Badingham Echo". 
 They organise a community bus service.
