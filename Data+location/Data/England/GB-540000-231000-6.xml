 Once a year, on the nearest Sunday to 
 St. Swithun's Day, the village holds  
 its Fair.The Fair is the highlight of 
 the community's year and is held on   
 the nearest Sunday to St. Swithun's   
 Day.The money raised goes to support  
 the Church,the school and other causes
 around the village.The Fair first     
 started in the Middle Ages and was    
 held on Cheapside.This is how         
 Cheapside got its name.The Fair was   
 restarted in 1978 by the Reverand     
 Roger Tamplin.                        
 At the Fair you can play games,buy    
 things,eat and drink,win prizes,see
