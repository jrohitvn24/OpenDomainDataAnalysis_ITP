		<content> We went to Loraine to interview       
 her about the Domesday  project. We   
 asked her some questions about the    
 Guides.                               
 She  first started Guides when she was
 asked because someone was ill.Then    
 someone asked her to join so she      
 joined . She has been doing Brownies  
 for 7 years but she is doing Guides   
 now. She has been running Guides for 6
 months. We asked her how many girls   
 were in the Guides. She said that     
 there were 7.It is run on a Monday    
 from 6.00 to 7.00 p.m.
