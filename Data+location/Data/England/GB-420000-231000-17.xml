		<title>17A DAY IN THE LIFE OF-MORETON</title>
		<content> We interviewed a{cashier}at a local   
 bank. She described her day. She gets 
 up at 07:00. Before breakfast she has 
 a bath. She meets her friends and gets
 to work at 09:00. When the bank opens 
 at 09:30 she deals with foreign       
 currency, cashes cheques and tells    
 customers their balances. Sometimes   
 she goes shopping at lunch time. When 
 the bank closes at 15:00 she takes the
 post to postbox and she leaves for    
 home at 17:00. At home she relaxes and
 in her spare time she plays badminton.
 Next we saw a{policeman.}He starts    
 work at 08:00. First he checks the    
 post and the night messages. Then he  
 walks or drives around the town. After
 lunch he goes to see people. Then he  
 drives round again. He finishes at    
 16:00. Sometimes he works a night     
 shift. He can see his family thirteen 
 weekends a year.                      </content>
