		<title>03PIANO LESSONS AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Mrs.Frost, our piano teacher, comes   
 into school to give us piano lessons  
 twice a week. We learn in groups of   
 mainly 4 or 5 people. In the lessons  
 we take it in turn to play on the     
 piano, and the rest of us play on     
 plastic keyboards. We have our exams  
 in Torquay. We take it in turns to go 
 into a room and play to the examiner. 
 We get our results in about a month   
 from the exam. We have to get 100 or  
 more marks to pass. Sometimes we go to
 Festivals, where we have to play on a 
 stage in front of lots of people. The 
 adjudicator chooses a winner out of   
 the different age groups. If we win we
 sometimes get a cup which we have for 
 a year but the trophies we keep. I've 
 had some auditions at "CHETHAMS SCHOOL
 OF MUSIC." I heard a while ago that I 
 shall be going there. CLARE SELBY.
