		<title>11Senior Citizens in Calbourne</title>
		<content>  As a{SENIOR CITIZEN}living in a small
 village community, life is quiet but  
 far from dull.  A sewing group meets  
 every fortnight where handicrafts are 
 made for the annual village Sale on   
 the Green.  We help with Fetes, Flower
 Festivals and Coffee mornings for our 
 local church.  We have a very active  
 Womens Institute, which meets once a  
 month, there is also an Institute     
 Choir.  Our well-stocked village shop 
 is supported by the elderly, who also 
 collect their pensions from the Post  
 Office.  Several senior citizens visit
 local urban areas to participate in   
 Bingo. Meals on wheels are available  
 should they be required by the older  
 members of the community.
