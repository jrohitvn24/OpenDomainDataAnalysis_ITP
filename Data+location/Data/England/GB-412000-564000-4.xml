		<title>04LOCAL HISTORY, RYTON.</title>
		<content>    On Friday, 28 June, 1985,          
 Councillor Cowans came to talk to us  
 about the history of our village,     
  yton.                                
    He told us about the  "Tumulus"    
 which is thought to contain the body  
 of a chieftain. During the 1926       
 General Strike local people had to dig
 for their own coal. Whilst digging,a  
 canoe from 8-9000 BC was found.It is  
 now in the Blackgate Museum,          
 Newcastle.                            
    The{pinfold}is the oldest relic in 
 Ryton Village.Stray animals were kept 
 in here. The pinfold is known in other
 areas as a penfold or pound. The man  
 who looked after the animals was      
 called the pounder. In the{Boldon Buke
 both the pinfold and the mill in Ryton
 are mentioned. About twenty years ago 
 the original mill stones were used as 
 foundations for a road.               </content>
