		<content>  Shortly before his death  in{1760 Wm.
{Cockin of Melsonby} set  up a{trust}by
 giving land in the form of a {12\ acre
{field }known  as {'Woodhill'} to  this
 parish.  This land was to be rented to
 the highest bidder and the{income from
{rent}was to be {used to educate 6 poor
{children}of the parish. Thus began the
 first  recorded school in the village.
  Some  time later, a{second field,}now
 referred  to  by  its  Ordnance Survey
 number {0.S.21} and sited on Gatherley
 Moor was added.                       
  This  trust was reorganised  in  1905
 and  again in {1978,}when it became an
{officially  registered  charity} under
 the title of {Wm. Cockin's Educational
{Foundation.}                          
  Money from  this fund is given by the
 trustees for such things as:- swimming
 lessons &amp; transport, sports &amp; micro-  
 computer equipment used in school etc.</content>
