		<title>04LANHYDROCK HOUSE</title>
		<content> Lanhydrock House and Estate have been 
 part of the {Local History}of Bodmin  
 since 1651 when the house was         
 completed by the second Lord          
 Robartes.  Since then the house has   
 been almost totally rebuilt after a   
 disastrous fire in 1881, when only the
 gatehouse and the north wing survived.
 The architecture is, therefore, mainly
 Victorian.  The house and land        
 remained in the hands of the Robartes 
 family until 1953 when the house and  
 400 acres were given to the National  
 Trust.                                
                                       
 The National Trust was founded in 1895
 to acquire for the nation ownership of
 land and buildings worthy of permanent
 preservation.  Their wish was to give 
 people access to areas of natural or  
 historic interest. The Trust is part  
 of {Tourism}in Great Britain.         </content>
