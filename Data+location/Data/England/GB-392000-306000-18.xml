		<title>18LEISURE - RIDING SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>Shareshill is fortunate in having two  
riding schools in the village,the      
oldest of which opened 2l years ago.It 
caters for pupils of all ages from a   
very wide area.It is home for 25 horses
including some livery,which are brought
in to the stables each day from nearby 
fields which are rented for grazing.The
school concentrates on teaching with   
great emphasis on safety.All rides in  
the surrounding lanes are escorted by  
trained riders.During school holidays  
two- and three-day courses are held on 
horse and stable management.The school 
always provides ponies for the church  
fete and other charitable events.Fred  
the donkey - believed to be over 3O -  
is a well-loved village character and  
likes to be taken for a walk by the    
village children.
