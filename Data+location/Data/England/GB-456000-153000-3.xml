		<content>  We interviewed a farmer who manages  
 Worting Wood Farm,which is part       
 of Many Down Company.He grows barley  
 potatoes wheat,tomatoes and beans.He  
 has over 300 animals which includes   
 donkeys,chickens and goats.The females
 are crossbreeds which are Herefords   
 and Friesians.There are two breeds of 
 bull which are Charolais and          
 Limousins.His cattle are not named    
 instead they identified with freeze   
 brand numbers.The calves have ear     
 tags.When harvesting comes the winter 
 barley comes first(middle to end of   
 July).There are 16 full  time people  
 who work on the farm which includes   
 two in the workshop,and two involved  
 with stock and maintenance. If they   
 have got too much straw and it is     
 unwanted they burn it carefully.
