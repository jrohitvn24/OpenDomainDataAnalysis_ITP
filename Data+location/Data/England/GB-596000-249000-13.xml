		<title>13Bildeston School Children</title>
		<content>I Pulled the curtains and had my break-
fast. I had one egg and a piece of     
bread and butter. I dressed and cleaned
my teeth with Blue Minty Gel.I went to 
the bus stop until the bus came and sat
with William.After a few minuted we got
off the bus and came straight into     
school and did ten spellings and the   
five times table.                      
Raun counted the children and chose    
David to do the weather.I went into the
hall with all the other children. We   
sang some songs and had a story about  
'The Ugly Duckling'.We came back and   
did sums,then it was apple playtime. We
played 'Star Wars' until the bell rang.
Some of us did sums or our work folders
I did my topic work until it was nearly
dinner time when we had to wash for    
lunch and say our prayers.             
At dinner time we had chips and baked  
beans.For afters we had banana custard.</content>
