 for worship in the following faiths:

 Reform and Wesley

 section of Haslington villagers the   
 following information was gleaned:the 
 majority of inhabitants of the area   
 were Church of England by faith and   
 many of those interviewed did not     
 attend a church on a regular basis    
 although many used to attend more     
 frequently in the past.
