		<content>{THE WATERCRESS WOMAN}is believed to be
 an old gypsy woman who scratched a    
 meagre existence by selling watercress
 from Pinnock stream. Somehow she spilt
 gin on to her shawl and a spark fell  
 from her pipe and the shawl caught    
 alight with the result that she burned
 to death.                             
{THE SCREAMING MAN }is yet another of  
 the Pluckley ghosts. It is impossible 
 to pinpoint the exact spot where this 
 unfortunates life was brought to its  
 sudden and tragic end. He was a worker
 at the Pluckley brickworks who fell to
 his untimely death in one of the clay 
 holes on the site. His piercing       
 screams can still be heard around this
 area.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
