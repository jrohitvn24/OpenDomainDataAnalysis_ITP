		<content> In Skelton village there is a small   
 Methodist chapel which is still in    
 use, the Methodist congregation goes  
 to the Chapel the first Sunday in     
 every month. There is also the        
 neglected and disused St Helen's      
 Chapel which is falling into serious  
 disrepair. Skelton has a lerge church 
 built to replace St Helen's but it is 
 not in our area.                      
 Marton Le Moor has two chapels, one a 
 Methodist, one a Church of England.   
 The Methodist chapel.is no longer in  
 use, it is in fact a house now. The   
 Church of England Church is still in  
 use, having monthly services taken by 
 the clergy at Ripon Cathedral.        
 For details of Kirby Hill Church which
 is part of the same benefice as       
 Skelton please see page 13.
