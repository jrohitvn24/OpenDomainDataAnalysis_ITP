 Brian has a big build and is tall.He  
 comes from Bristol and has a Bristol

 home.It was quite dark inside his     
 house but it was cosy.Charlotte and I 
 sat on the floor and Brian sat on a   
 stool.Brian is talking about fishing  
 around the coast from Dartmouth to    
 Redlap.                               
 "I have my own Charter Vessel I take  
 anglers out. They come from all over  
 the country,that's how I make my      
 living.I have a Mitchelle 31,it's     
 licensed for 10 anglers.It's fully    
 equipped with radar,radio,VHF,echo-   
 sounder and fish-finder.That's a lot  
 of expensive equipment,but you've got 
 to to give the best day's fishing,also
 for safety and my license."           </content>
