		<title>16Nether Stowey:Fire Service</title>
		<content> In 1969 the Somerset Fire Service     
 opened the village station. Fourteen  
 part time firemen living close by give
 a 24 hour service. After a 999 call   
 the main control station sends a radio
 frequency signal to a special receiver
 at our fire station. This activates   
 all personal alerters which the       
 firemen carry at all times. Some      
 people think that the siren was best  
 for alerting the whole village and    
 clearing the streets of traffic. The  
 siren now belongs to the Ministry of  
 Defence. The station also has a       
 monitor for radiation leaks into the  
 atmosphere (NB proximity of nuclear   
 power station).A large water tender,  
 with a 13.5m ladder, holds 1800 litres
 of water. A special Landrover carrying
 a 250 litre water bag and pump has    
 easier access to remote hill areas.70-
 80 fires,mostly domestic/farm, a year.</content>
