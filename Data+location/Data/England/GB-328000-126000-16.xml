		<title>16OUR TAUNTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Our school,Lyngford Park County      
 Primary,was built fifteen years ago.It
 is in the middle of a housing estate. 
 The age range is from 5_11 and there  
 are 250 children.The school has a     
 headmistress,eight teachers and two   
 school assistants.A few parents come  
 in to help with practical activities. 
  The school is built in four separate,
 one_storey blocks around a courtyard. 
 We have two tarmac playgrounds and a  
 large playing field.Parents helped to 
 raise the money to build a covered,   
 unheated swimming pool.               
  We are at school from 9.00am to      
 3.30pm,forty weeks of the year.We use 
 television,videos,tape recorders and  
 computers to help with our lessons.   
  We think we come to school to learn  
 to read,write,do sums and get on with 
 other people.                         
  School's pretty good on the whole.   </content>
