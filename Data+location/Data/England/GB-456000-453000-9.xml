		<title>09Bad Egg : A Game</title>
		<content>   Not many people like this game      
 because it is rough. The person on    
 picks a subject like cars. The others 
 choose a name of a car then all say   
 the cars chosen. The person on throws 
 a ball up and shouts a car name.      
 Whoever chose that car runs for the   
 ball and shouts "stop." All players   
 stand still and the one with the ball 
 takes 3 fairy steps, 3 strides, 3     
 jumps and 3 spits forward. He throws  
 the ball at the nearest person. If the
 person is hit he gets a bad egg and   
 he's on. If the ball misses the       
 thrower is on again and gets a bad    
 egg. This is repeated until someone   
 has three bad eggs. The person who    
 loses gets hit with a ball by each    
 person playing.
