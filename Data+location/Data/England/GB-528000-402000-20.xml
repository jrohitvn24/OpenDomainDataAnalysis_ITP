		<title>20A SUMMARY OF HOLTON-LE CLAY</title>
		<content>  During the last 40 years the         
 population of Holton-le-Clay has grown
 rapidly. This is mainly due to        
 Industry on the Humber Bank, North Sea
 Oil and British Gas Terminals. The    
 average price of property is one of   
 the lowest in the country.            
 Another contributing factor is        
 the low rates compared to             
 neighbouring Humberside over the      
 last eleven years. Many families stay 
 in the area only a short time because 
 of change of occupation or because of 
 lack of amenities in the village.
