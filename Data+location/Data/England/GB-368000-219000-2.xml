		<title>02Local History of MayHill</title>
		<content>{MayHill}is formed of sandstone &amp; its  
 summit is reached on footpaths which  
 mark the area .MayHill was originally 
 known as{Yartleton}Hill,being owned by
 people from several parishes,but      
 became known as MayHill because by    
 custom people gathered on May 1st to  
 fight for possession of the hill.The  
 local Morris Men come to greet MayDay 
 by dancing at dawn on MayHill.{Legend}
 says there are only 99 trees in the   
 clump at the summit but in reality    
 there are over 200 trees having been  
 planted in their present clump to     
 celebrate{Queen Victoria's Golden  }  
{Jubilee}.The area around the summit   
 now                                   
 belongs to Longhope Parish Council    
 while the surrounding land is the     
 property of the National Trust.
