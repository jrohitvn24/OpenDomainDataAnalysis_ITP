		<title>03N.CAVE CHURCH FUND RAISING</title>
		<content>      Hello!  I am a reporter for the  
 local paper and I am writing an       
 article on All Saints' Church, North  
 Cave.    I am finding out about the   
 fund-raising events and what they were
 for.                                  
                                       
      In l978 there was a country      
 festival lasting a weekend to raise   
 money to renew the lead on the church 
 roof.   In l980 money was collected   
 around the village at coffee mornings,
 garden fetes and sales of work,etc.   
 The church was repainted, rewired and 
 was treated for woodworm.    In l985  
 there was a marquee dinner which      
 produced Â£2000 towards repainting the 
 church clock and other expenses.      
 Money has been given in the village   
 for heating and new lights too.       
 Whenever the church has needed        
 financial aid it has always been found</content>
