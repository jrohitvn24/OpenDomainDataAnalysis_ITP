		<content>   Now huge lorries and tankers come   
 down village lanes which are only just
 wide enough for two cars to pass.     
  The result is that the banks         
 retaining the fields are being broken 
 down and cottagers are having to place
 stone blocks to protect their homes   
 from damage.                          
  The greatest fear in the village is  
 that our ancient bridge will collapse 
 under the excessive stress, that      
 homes will be shaken to pieces or that
 our children might suffer serious     
 injury from the ever increasing volume
 of traffic passing through Culmstock.
