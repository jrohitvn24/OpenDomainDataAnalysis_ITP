		<title>01Holmcroft's Area.</title>
		<content>The area covered by our School included
the northern part of Stafford,known as 
the "North End" and a large rural area 
on the North-north west of Stafford.   
Although three quarters of our area is 
rural,it included Doxey Marshes, a     
wildlife reserve, and the M6 junction  
No.14.The urban area consists of an    
Industrial Revolution type zone with   
houses and old shoe factories built    
about 1870,which has expanded over the 
years to the north of Stafford town as 
more houses were built and are still   
being built.
