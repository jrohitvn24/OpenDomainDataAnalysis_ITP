		<content>   The only industry, besides farming, 
 in this area is a small chocolate     
 factory on the outskirts of Rangemore 
 village. It has been in operation for 
 only{18 months.}The building was once 
 a tank house for watering the         
 greenhouses of Rangemore Hall. Now it 
 has been converted and two men produce
{Crown Royale Chocolates.}             
   Half a ton of special Belgian       
 chocolate is filled with unsalted     
 sweet cream butter made into 18       
 different flavours. The most popular  
 are strawberry, apricot, coffee, rum, 
 praline, butterscotch and lemon.      
   The chocolates are sold in the      
 largest{department stores}and are     
{exported}to many parts of the world   
 including Japan, Canada, India and    
 America.
