		<content> TRANSPORT THROUGH SILVERDALE          
                                       
 Silverdale is served by both rail and 
 bus connections to towns and villages 
 to north, south, east and west. The   
 railway station, which is situated    
 over one mile from the village centre,
 is on the Carnforth to Barrow line.   
 About a dozen trains per day in each  
 direction provide a convenient means  
 of transport for commuters, mainly to 
 Lancaster and Preston, but also across
 the Bay to Grange and beyond.         
 The Ribble bus service which passes   
 through the village centre provides a 
 slower means of transport to Lancaster
 and Kendal, passing through many small
 settlements on the way.
