		<title>01The Area West Of Widdrington</title>
		<content> Lying in the coastal plain, the       
 landscape is mostly flat then rises   
 gently to a height of 300ft at its    
 western edge.   A rich agricultural   
 area where the land cover is almost   
 equally half arable and half grass,   
 with a number of woodlands featuring  
 prominently.   Within this rural      
 setting lies a section of the main    
 east coast railway line, an open cast 
 mining site and a brick works.   The  
 largest number of local people are    
 employed on the eight farms covering  
 the area, followed by the brick works 
 and the open cast site, with British  
 Rail employing only two locals at     
 Felton Land level crossing and        
 Chevington signal box.   There are few
 houses the largest groups comprising  
 farm workers cottages with a few      
 farm houses and railway cottages.     
 There are no public transport         </content>
