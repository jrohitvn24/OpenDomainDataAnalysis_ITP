		<title>20ECOLOGY OF BUTTERTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 Butterton has its own small village,  
surrounded by greenery. I found that   
the hedges at the roads have densely   
overgrown with marsh marrigolds,       
nettles and tall grass. The roads are  
about 4 metres wide, because hardly any
cars use it. There are several fishing 
ponds in the area. There are many types
of birds, including swallows and       
lapwings. This is because of the swamps
around the area. The air is very clean,
but when you go past the farms you can 
hardly breathe because of the smell of 
pig manure. Butterton is a beautiful   
piece of countryside and I hope it     
will stay like that.
