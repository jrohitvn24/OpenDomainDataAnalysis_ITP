		<content> On 26th June Mr F. Luddington visited 
 us at school to answer our questions  
 about changes in the area.He was born 
 in 1898 and lived at College Farm on  
 Adams Lane.There were about 70 houses 
 in Great Paxton at the beginning of   
 the century,and Paxton Place was then 
 the Vicarage.The school was one hall  
 built in 1856 and a house for the     
 headmistress,Miss Etchells.The other  
 teachers were Miss Judd and Miss      
 King.The 80 pupils sat on wooden      
 benches to do                         
 reading,writing,arithmetic,woodwork   
 and sewing.Everyone went home for     
 lunch from 12:00 to 2:00pm.The village
 was very quiet,perhaps only one or two
 horses and carts passing each         
 day.There were two pubs,The Bell and  
 The Black Bull and one shop.Nearly    
 everyone worked in the village.
