		<content> Ilfracombe is situated on a rocky     
 coast in North Devon.Every year       
 tourists come in large numbers for    
 their holidays and enjoy the beaches  
 and beautiful country side.There are  
 two harbours where boats are moored,  
 one at Ilfracombe and the other at    
 Watermouth.There are three main hills 
 in Ilfracombe which you can see       
 clearly,one is called Capstone the    
 other is called Hillsborough,which was
 once an Iron Age Hill Fort,the other  
 is called Lantern Hill, which has had 
 a light on it to guide ships away from
 danger since the eleventh century.In  
 our D block there is a little village 
 called Hele.It has an old water mill  
 which still grinds corn today.Most of 
 the farmland is rough grazing for     
 sheep,but at Watermouth there are     
 llamas.
