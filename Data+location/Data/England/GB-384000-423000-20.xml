		<title>20Shopping in Water</title>
		<content> Bacup has its own shopping centre with
 many sorts of varied shops but Water  
 in the North West of the block is     
 totally different. In the past there  
 were many shops, some selling         
 groceries, some clothes,it even had   
 its own Co-operative branch. Now there
 are only two-a general foodstore for  
 those items people need quickly, and a
 newsagents.                           
    Nowadays, many residents do a large
 weekly shop at the nearest big        
 supermarket which is Asda, 5 miles    
 away in Rawtenstall. For a family of  
 two adults and two children this      
 weekly bill can reach Â£80.00 and could
 well include clothes and toys as well 
 as food. For other items people travel
 to Burnley, the nearest big town, 5   
 miles North West.
