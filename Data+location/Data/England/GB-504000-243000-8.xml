		<content> INTERVIEW WITH THE SITE MANAGER       
   The depot covers an area of 450     
 acres. Before the first World War the 
 site was all farmland and then during 
 the second World War the site was used
 as a bomb and shell filling factory.  
 After the war the factory was closed. 
 In july of 1969 the Central           
 Electricity Generating Board bought   
 the site with a view to building a    
 power station which however did not   
 materialise. The buildings on the site
 are now let for a variety of uses by  
 the C.E.G.B.
