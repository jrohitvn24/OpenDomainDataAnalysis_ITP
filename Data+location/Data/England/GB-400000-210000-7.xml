		<content>In this area of scattered population,  
the majority of farmers had combine    
harvesters of their own.Only one hired 
or contracted out the harvest work.Most
farmers had between 3 &amp; 5 tractors     
which were used to undertake the many  
tasks on the farm,using such items of  
equipment as ploughs,balers,silage     
cutters etc. Some farmers had dairy    
herds and all of the associated milking
equipment.This was housed in dairy     
parlours and included such items as the
milking harnesses to attach to the cows
udders,glass measuring flasks,etc.Also 
on each farm there was a refrigeration 
tank in which the milk was collected   
and stored until collection by road    
tanker each day.                       
    There has been a considerable      
increase in the amount of equipment    
used on farms since 1950 at the expense
of the employment of a manual workforce</content>
