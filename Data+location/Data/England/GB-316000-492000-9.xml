		<title>09Ulpha C.E School</title>
		<content> Our shool is in Ulpha and some        
 children come five miles to school. It
 had a new extension built in 1967 and 
 we have lovely views.I measured the   
 playground and the width 13 metres.We 
 have three big rooms all about six    
 metres square.It is safe to  play     
 outside because the school is 100     
 metres from the road.Everyone stays   
 for dinner.The dinner comes from Black
 Combe School Millom and Mr Fletcher   
 brings it in containers Mrs Trenouth  
 helps.Today we had mince and dumplings
 and jacket potatoes or hot dogs and a 
 bun,yoghurt or ice cream.
