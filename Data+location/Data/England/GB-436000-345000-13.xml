 Written by an 11_year_old child       
 In the morning we split into groups to
 find out different things about the   
 Sports Centre. The group I was in were
 finding out things about the Sports   
 Hall and Gymnasium. I was very        
 surprised at the size of the Sports   
 Hall. It must have been the biggest   
 place I have ever been in. I was      
 surprised to find that the Sports Hall
 could have 400 people dancing in it   
 but only 10 playing football. I also  
 found out that it is quite possible to
 get a broken leg on the trampoline and
 if that isnt much to be surprised at I
 also found that the goal_posts are    
 quite often vandalised. After that I  
 had dinner and tried to hit a ball    
 with a bat all afternoon (I think I   
 missed it more times than I hit it).
