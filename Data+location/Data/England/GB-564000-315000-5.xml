		<content>  The area is traversed from West to   
 East by the{A47}trunk road which is   
 the main route from the Midlands to   
 Great Yarmouth. It is heavily used but
 is single carriageway although there  
 are campaigns currently to have it    
 enlarged to dual carriageway.         
  The A47 passes through the middle    
 of Middleton with a 40 m.p.h. speed   
 limit.Crossing the road can be a real 
 problem for the villagers.            
{ Buses}are few and mainly confined to 
 the main road. North Runcton people   
 have at least a half mile walk to the 
 bus route. Old people that we spoke to
 said that they wished there were more 
 buses.                                
  Most people living in the villages   
 rely upon{private cars}for transport. 
 There are real trsansport difficulties
 for children and old people.
