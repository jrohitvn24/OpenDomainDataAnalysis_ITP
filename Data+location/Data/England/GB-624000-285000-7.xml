		<content>{Family Life in Alburgh                
 The extended family is an important   
 feature in the way of life of rural   
 Norfolk.There are many instances of   
 families living in the same area as   
 grand parents, great grand parents and
 aunts, uncles and  cousins.  With     
 support from relatives such as these  
 these living close at hand the local  
 family tends to be  very  self        
 contained, needing little extra social
 life. The ownership of farms is pasted
 on from gereration to gereration with 
 the children growing up in the        
 knowlefge that their future will be in
 the farm.                             
 In many families both parents are wage
 earners. This is made posible by the  
 number of electical machines used in  
 the home such as washing machines,dish
 washers,vacum cleaners,freezers and   
 microwave ovens.                      </content>
