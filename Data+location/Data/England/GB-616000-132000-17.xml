		<title>17Public Houses</title>
		<content>  As long as the soldiers were in the  
 town, Hythe had many public houses but
 when the army left many closed but    
 there are still plenty left from the  
 smallest, the{Three Mariners,}to the  
 large{Red Lion.} One of the oldest is 
{The Bell,}probably the ancient harbour
 pub but the only proof are smugglers  
 tales. Beneath the floor is a tunnel; 
 a legendary hiding place for casks of 
 Brandy. In the attic is a hook that   
 was used to hoist them out.           
  Several of the pubs in the High      
 Street are first heard of in the      
 sixteenth century.{The Swan,}built in 
 1506 was an eighteenth century posting
 inn with a milestone set in the front 
 wall.{The White Hart}has a seventeenth
 century exterior but looks older      
 inside. There are no cellars which    
 could mean it was once on the water   
 front.                                </content>
