		<title>10A day in the life of Sarah</title>
		<content> My name is Sarah.I get up at 7 o'clock
 in the morning.I get washed and       
 dressed and I go downstairs for       
 breakfast.Then I clean my teeth.I read
 or go out to play before school.At ten
 to nine I put my coat and get my      
 books.I walk to school with my brother
 Ian.At school the teacher marks the   
 register and then we go to assembly.In
 class I do writing and sums and have  
 my milk.At playtime I play with Helen 
 and Lindsey and Karen and we play     
 catchy with Craig and Wesley.Lunchtime
 I have dinner at school and then I    
 play with Victoria.When I come home I 
 have my tea and afterwards I go       
 outside to play.Tonight I am going to 
 a club.When I come home I get washed  
 and I have supper.Then I go to bed at 
 8 o'clock.
