		<content>   Whaddon Way is the main road through
 Bletchley.It used to be just a narrow 
 country road with fields around       
 it.Bletchley was a nice farming town  
 with only a few roads and not very    
 busy.                                 
   Not long ago the population was was 
 8,000 but it is now 28,000.Only a     
 quarter of the people who now live in 
 Bletchley came before the 1980's.     
   Bletchley Park was used to decode   
 German messages during the war.The    
 Brickworks was the main place of      
 enployment.                           
   During the war a Womans Land Army   
 hostel was in Church Green Road.They  
 worked on the land when their husbands
 were at war.                          
   The Cattle Market stood where       
 Sainsbury's is now.
