		<title>10FARMING part 1.</title>
		<content> The area is mainly of small hill farms
 most of which are owned by the farmer,
 though some of the farmers are        
 tennants of the Milburn Estates or    
 other smaller landowners.             
 Many farms have sheep. These are      
 mainly Scottish Blackface, Swaledale, 
 Leicester Blueface and Suffolk. Many  
 of the sheep graze mainly on the moor.
 Dairy Farming,in which the milk is    
 sold to the Milk Marketing Board and  
 is collected daily from the farm by a 
 Tanker.The Dairy cows are mainly      
 Friesan,Hereford,Charolais and Black  
 Angus.An Ayrshire Herd also sells milk
 locally.                              
 Some farmers keep grant aided suckler 
 cow herds. A grant is given to farmers
 running suckler cows on poor quality  
 high ground.These produce calves      
 which are later sold for beef.
