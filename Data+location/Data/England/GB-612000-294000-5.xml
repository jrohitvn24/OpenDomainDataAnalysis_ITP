		<content>{Fundenhall is truly rural.}Planning   
 regulations ban new residential       
 buildings unless for agricultural     
 occupancy, therefore houses are mostly
 old cottages &amp; farms.Land is either   
 under a non-grass crop or managed     
 grassland for the 300 head Manor Farm 
 dairy herd or the Hunter horses of    
 Fundenhall Grange.There are many      
 man-made ponds called pits.A few lanes
 cross the area and 1 B class road part
 of which is still called the Turnpike,
 a relic of toll collecting days.Brick 
 Kiln Lane is known locally as Bricky  
 Lane.                                 
 The Post Office is in a private house 
 but the school is long closed. St.    
 Nicholas Church has a fortnightly     
 service with more parishioners        
 attending its special services.
