		<title>18THE FONABY SACK</title>
		<content>    Originally this stone sack stood   
 upright in the middle of the field,   
 but years ago it was moved to the base
 of the hedge to help ploughing. Now   
 all that remains are the two separate 
 pieces of grey stone peering out of   
 the ground.                           
    Every summer brings a number of    
 people who are interested in the      
 stone and its curse and at least one  
 farmworker still respects the landmark
 and its secrets.                      
    A well known local figure has      
 worked the land around the {Stone Sack
 for these past thirty years from a    
 farm at Fonaby Top (which is a matter 
 of yards from the fabled field and its
 mystic contents). The field is        
 actually named {Stone Sack Field.}He  
 said, 'This stone has stopped in the  
 middle of the field for donkey's years
 and then somebody decided to move it. </content>
