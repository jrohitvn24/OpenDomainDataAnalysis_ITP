		<title>15A NEW HOUSING ESTATE part 1</title>
		<content>      There are several new housing    
 estates being built in Heaton         
 Mersey.We visited Barrat's new        
 development on Kingsleigh Road.We     
 spoke to the site manager and sales   
 representative.They told us that they 
 chose this area because South         
 Manchester is very popular.However    
 there is a shortage of land so it is  
 very expensive.                       
      First they had to submit plans to
 the Town Hall and get planning        
 permission.Then they did a land       
 survey.If the land is suitable they   
 start to build roads and put in       
 services such as water, gas,          
 electricity and sewage.Then they build
 the foundations which are one metre   
 deep.It then takes about twelve weeks 
 to complete a large house before the  
 buyer can move in.
