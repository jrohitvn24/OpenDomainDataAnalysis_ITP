		<title>02WORCESTER,BIRMINGHAM CANAL</title>
		<content>   The canal has boats going along it  
 from Birmingham to Worcester.These    
 boats are dangerous to fish.The       
 noise of the boat scares fish away and
 the fish sometimes die of fright or   
 are killed by the boats themselves.   
 At the bottom of the canal there is   
 mud.This mud gets there because people
 throw it in or the rain washes it     
 in.The canal is used for fishing.A lot
 of people go fishing down the canal.On
 the canal there are locks these locks 
 are for the boats,they stop the water 
 from rushing in to the open canal.The 
 canal  is  dangerous  for little      
 children to be by.People have drowned 
 in the canal because people fell in   
 and the mud dragged them down.The     
 water of the canals is always dirty.
