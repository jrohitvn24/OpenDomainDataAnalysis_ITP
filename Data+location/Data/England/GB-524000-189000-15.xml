		<title>15FINCHLEY MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Finchley Manor House is today a   
 centre for Judaism and has a synagogue
 and houses the Akiva Primary School.  
 The house was built in 1723 by Thomas 
 Allen. The top floor is an addition of
 the 1920's. At the foot of the rear   
 garden there is one arm of a deeply   
 cut moat,now dry and much overgrown.  
 There are very early references to a  
 moated Manor House in Finchley and it 
 is usually assumed that earlier       
 buildings stood on this same site.    
 Inside the house has an excellent main
 staircase and notable chimney pieces, 
 panelling and decorative plaster.     
 Opposite the Manor House is Manor     
 View, built following the filling-in  
 of a stretch of water with an island  
 in the middle, usually referred to as 
 "the Moat", which may have been the   
 digging site for clay bricks for the  
 Manor House.                          </content>
