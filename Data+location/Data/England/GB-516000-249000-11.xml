		<title>11LIVING IN SANDY</title>
		<content>  I HAVE ONLY LIVED IN SANDY SINCE     
 NOVEMBER 1984, BUT I THINK IT IS A    
 GREAT PLACE TO LIVE.                  
  SIX O'CLOCK AND IT'S TIME TO GET UP, 
 GET DRESSED AND THEN GO WITH MUM TO   
 DRIVE DAD TO WORK. WHEN WE GET BACK   
 ABOUT HALF PAST SIX CHARLIE THE BREAD 
 MAN COMES. I HELP MUM PACK THE BREAD  
 ON THE SHOP SHELVES. I LIVE ABOVE THE 
 CAFE AND SHOP.                        
  WHEN ANNIE ONE OF THE SHOP ASSISTANTS
 ARRIVES I HELP MUM MAKE THE DELIVERIES
 TO THE FACTORIES. AS SOON AS WE GET   
 BACK I PACK UP MY LUNCH AND MUM TAKES 
 ME TO SCHOOL.                         
  WE START SCHOOL AT NINE O'CLOCK AND  
 FINISH AT 3.30PM. I ENJOY SCHOOL AND  
 PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS. WHEN I GET   
 HOME I WATCH SOME TELEVISION UNTIL    
 DINNERTIME. ON TUESDAYS I GO TO CUBS  
 WHICH IS GREAT FUN. I HAVE JUST BEEN  
 INVESTED.I LIKE LIVING IN SANDY.      </content>
