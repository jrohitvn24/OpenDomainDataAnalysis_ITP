		<title>02THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are 24 children in the school.  
 They are divided into two classes,    
 one junior and one infant.   There are
 two teachers.   We start school at    
 9.15.   The infants finish at 3.15 and
 the juniors finish at 3.45.   We all  
 stay at school for dinner.   The      
 school is an old brick building on the
 edge of the village.   Children start 
 school in the term when they are five 
 and transfer to the secondary school  
 when they are eleven years old.   We  
 have lessons in language, mathematics,
 topic, which is a mixture of          
 geography, history and science, and   
 other things like music and physical  
 education.                            
 Most of the pages in this survey are  
 about the family life and activities  
 of the children in this school.
