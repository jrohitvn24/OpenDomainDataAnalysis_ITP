{History.                              
 One of the houses a group visited had 
 been converted from the old Post      
 Office and shop, with the old bakery  
 at the back made into a grandparents  
 annexe.                               
{The oldest house}we visited, is called
 Chalton Priory. A very large flint    
 building abutting onto the church. It 
 used to be the rectory owned by the   
 Abbess of Nuneaton.                   
 Another house was the old Board       
 School. The new owners have put in a  
 bathroom and inside loos. The old     
 Schoolroom, about 10 metres by 20     
 metres has been turned into a sitting 
 room.                                 
 A barn had been converted into a      
 house.                                
 One new house was being built.
