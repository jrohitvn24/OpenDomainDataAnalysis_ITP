 black and white half timbered house,  
 built in the 16th centuary.{Hoolgrave 
{Manor}dates back to the same time but 
 is red brick{Red Hall}is part Georgian
 and Victorian but a former house is   
 now a barn.In between the old and the 
 new is a moat, perhaps the site of a  
 former house{Eardswick Hall}also has a
 moat where a clay and wattle house    
 once stood.The outbuildings are half_ 
 timbered in black and white.The house 
 has the small hexagonal window panes  
 typical of many estate houses in South
 Cheshire.
