		<content> Housing in Woodley and Whistley Green 
 shows great variety. Some is quite old
 one even has no electricity. Many     
 business people have moved into the   
 area to live. Houses are expensive _  
 from Â£40,000 upwards. There are very  
 few council houses. Most of the houses
 are semi_detached/detached. There are 
 3 private housing estates and one     
 council estate. The council estate    
 borders on Sonning and the private    
 estates are:_ between Western Ave and 
 Butts Hill Rd; the area surrounding   
 Willowbank School and finally, an area
 south of Twyford which includes Swans 
 Crescent, Mallard Close, Woodpecker   
 Close and Kingfisher Crescent. In     
 contrast Whistley Green has no new    
 housing development of any size, being
 surrounded by farmland. Hinton House  
 is of historic interest and is now in 
 use as a private school.              </content>
