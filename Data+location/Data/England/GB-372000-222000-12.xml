		<content> MOAT FARM (CONT PAGE 11)              
 To maximize the output from the farm  
 Mr. Keene uses fertilizers and        
 pesticides. These are very expensive, 
 a 750 Kg bag of fertilizer costs Â£75. 
 They are in a powder form and are     
 applied to the crops by spray from a  
 tractor. They have to careful when    
 they do spray the crops so that the   
 powder is not washed away by the rain 
 to pollute the streams.               
 The farm loses some of its crop to    
 small animals, rabbits, rats, mice and
 birds but no special precautions are  
 taken against these pests.            
 The main crop at Moat Farm is barley  
 which is sold to a local farming      
 co-operative for animal feed. The farm
 does have 200 acres set aside for     
 horticulture and a few acres for      
 gooseberries and blackcurrants.
