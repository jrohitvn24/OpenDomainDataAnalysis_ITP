		<title>11STAMFORD GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> Stamford Golf Club is an 18 hole      
 private members club situated at      
 Oakfield House, Heyheads, Stalybridge,
 Cheshire. Since its foundation in 1900
 the course has seen many changes      
 especially in the way the holes have  
 been laid out over the years. New     
 layouts have been made as a result of 
 building developments both private and
 council which changed the character of
 the course. Holes were lost as a      
 result of 'Dig for Victory' during the
 Second World War leaving only 13 holes
 until Jubilee Year 1977 when extra    
 land was leased from Stamford Estates 
 to once more give the course 18 holes.
 Stamford is ringed by hills, Bucton   
 and Harridge to the east and Luzley to
 the west. To the south looking towards
 Stalybridge is Hartshead Power Station
 which is soon to be demolished.
