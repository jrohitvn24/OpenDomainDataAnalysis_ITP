		<title>15HOTHFIELD CHURCH (1)</title>
		<content> The area within the square is mainly  
 farmland with a small area of woodland
 consisting of decidious trees.        
                                       
{Hothfield Church,}which is some       
 distance from the village, dates from 
 the{13th century.}Adjacent to the     
 church is{Hothfield Manor}which is now
 a private residential home for the    
 elderly, also dates from the 13th     
 century, the original house became    
 unsafe and was largely rebuilt during 
 WW II.                                
                                       
 Another feature of the square is a    
 small Wood turning factory, a family  
 business specialising in furniture    
 components. Some of the machinery is  
 over 100 years old and still in good  
 working order.
