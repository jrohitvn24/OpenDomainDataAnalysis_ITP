		<content> Our family read books,go fishing  and 
 go on holidays. We play games with    
 cards,watch television,go riding or   
 garden. Sometimes we play snooker and 
 go for walks. I go riding and garden  
 with my mum. I also collect horse     
 brasses,stamps,china horses and china 
 rabbits. My eighteen year old sister  
 collects hat pins and thimbles, as    
 well as postcards. My sixteen year old
 brother collects beer bottles and     
 records. My parents collect Victorian 
 pictures and glass fruit bowls.       
    People under 25 go to discos, watch
 television, play with toys or go      
 swimming. If the person is eighteen or
 over they can go to a pub and drink   
 alchohol. People over 50 do spare time
 activites like: gardening,sewing,     
 reading and flower arranging.
