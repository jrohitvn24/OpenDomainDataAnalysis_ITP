		<title>01Introduction to Kinoulton</title>
		<content>    Our{Domesday Area}is made up of    
{farmland}and small patches of{wood-   
{land.It}includes most of the village  
 of{Kinoulton,}which has its origins in
{Saxon}times,and is bisected in a North
 South direction by the{Fosseway,}a    
 Roman road.The now disused{Grantham   
{Canal}also runs through our area.     
    Kinoulton is on the edge of the    
 picturesque{Vale of Belvoir}with a    
 distant view of{Belvoir Castle.       
    Although the landscape is dominated
 by farmland very few farm workers are 
 needed and so present-day Kinoulton is
 largely a{commuter village}for people 
 working in Nottingham, Leicester and  
 other large towns in the Midlands.
