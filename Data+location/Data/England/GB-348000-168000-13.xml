		<title>13TEENAGERS IN BACKWELL</title>
		<content>   Backwell has only a few activities  
 for teenagers. They consist of Youth  
 Clubs, Guides, Scouts and Rangers .   
   At weekends many teenagers go out of
 Backwell for their entertainment,but  
 some prefer to stay and go to Backwell
 Leisure Centre,swimming ,playing      
 Squash, Badminton and Tennis.         
   In school holidays Backwell holds a 
 Summer Festival.Every June there is an
 event at Backwell Lake called the     
 Ponderama.                            
   You have a disadvantage if you live 
 in the centre of Backwell .           
   There is not a lot of things for    
 teenagers to do in the evening .Very  
 rarely the W.I holds a disco . There  
 are four churches in Backwell,in which
 some teenagers attend.                
   There aren't any clothes shops in   
 Backwell so a lot of people leave     
 Backwell to shop elsewhere .          </content>
