{Dairy Farming }is the most important  
 type locally.Friesian cows are the mos
 -t common though some Jersey cows are 
 kept.Farms are no longer concentrated 
 round the farm house.Using modern meth
 -ods and equipment,a few men can run m
 ore than one farm.The average sized fa
 rm is 181 acres,the ratio of men to ac
 reage is 1:61 and the average herd siz
 ed is 200.Thanks to Common Market rule
 s the emphasis is gradually changing a
 nd more{mixed farming}is being introdu
 ced.Many farmers are now keeping beef 
 cattle calves,goats,sheep,pigs,chicken
 s and turkeys.One farm rears 20,000 tu
 rkeys.Charollais and other breeds have
 been introduced,usually for cross bree
 ding as they provide the bulk lacking 
 in the Friesians.Most breeding is done
 by artificial insemination but some br
 eeding bulls are kept.                </content>
