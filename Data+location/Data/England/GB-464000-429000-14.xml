		<content> I attend Hemingbrough Primary School.I
 get up for 8-00am, get dressed in my  
 school uniform which is grey with a   
 blue and gold striped tie,then I go   
 down and have breakfast of toast and  
 milk. At 8-30am I arrive at school on 
 my bike.School opens at 9-00 when we  
 have Assembly. Afterwards we have     
 lessons until 10-30 when we have a    
 break.Lessons continue until noon when
 I go home for my dinner.Most children 
 stay at school.After dinner we play   
 until 1-00pm when we have a different 
 teacher. School ends at 3-30 and then 
 we take part in activities.Sometimes  
 after school I go fishing, sometimes I
 go to the playing field.My favourite  
 meal is meat, potatoes, carrots and   
 gravy followed by rice pudding.       
 Sometimes I go back to school at night
 for a Disco. Then I go to bed at      
 9-30pm after having milk and biscuits.</content>
