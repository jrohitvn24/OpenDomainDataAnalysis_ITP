		<title>19BLACKMORE VALE  SUMMARY</title>
		<content> Naturally endowed with good deep soil 
 and a reliable rainfall this land     
 yields vast quantities of tuberculin  
 tested milk which is collected from   
 the farms by tankers,treated,then     
 distibuted over a wide area.          
 Sturminster cheese factory produces   
 quantities of prize winning cheddar   
 cheese and some cream and yoghurt.    
 Besides a steady monthly milk cheque  
 coming in the farmers can supplement  
 their income by selling unwanted      
 calves in the local market or by      
 fattening calves for beef.            
 The farmers do have problems.Many have
 had to sell milking cows to conform   
 with the quota system and this reduces
 the number of calves available and the
 amount of silage needed in winter.    
 Overall the farmer,who has to milk    
 twice a day every day of the year,wins
 a fair return for his labour and skill</content>
