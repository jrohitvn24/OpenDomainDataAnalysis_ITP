		<content> Merebrow is a small village. The      
 countryside surrounding it is mostly  
 flat, except for a hill down 'Marshes 
 Lane'. 'Mere' means lake and 'brow'   
 means hill. From that we know that in 
 Merebrow there used to be a lake that 
 stopped at the hill. The farms of     
 Holmes, the oldest area, are on the   
 highest part which was also an island 
 in this lake area. Some of Merebrow is
 deciduous wood land .                 
   The soil is rich and when it is     
 turned over it is very black. It is   
 used for growing vegetables and cereal
 crops. Most of the land is owned by   
 Lord Lilford. On part of the area many
 people  enjoy a day out at the Leisure
 Lakes. Here you can fish, sail boats, 
 wind surf, fly model planes canoe and 
 camp. In this part there is also a    
 Fruit Farm where people come to pick  
 soft fruit and vegetables.            </content>
