		<title>06Changing times in Strensall</title>
		<content> There have been many changes in       
 Strensall over the last{fifty years.  
 Now there is a health centre with six 
 doctors. The nearest doctor was at    
 Flaxton, four miles away. And he      
 travelled by horse to his patients.   
 There were more shops in the village  
 fifty years ago including two         
 blacksmiths,two joiners,a baker,a     
 cobbler,a tailor,a dressmaker and two 
 grocers. There was also a post office 
 and two public houses. In those days  
 the grocers made the bread to sell in 
 the shop. They bought butter and eggs 
 from the local farmers.  They often   
{exchanged}these for flour and other   
 groceries that the farmers needed.    
 The{children}were able to play in the 
 streets because there was very little 
 traffic. The{army band}often marched  
 through the village of Strensall.
