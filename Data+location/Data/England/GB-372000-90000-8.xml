		<content>  {Reading Beds:}being largely sand are
 of little use for agriculture and in  
 the past grew little but scrubby trees
 and firs. But does provide good       
 builders sand.                        
  {Alluvium:}surrounding the course of 
 the R.Frome gives virtually flat and  
 valuable agricultural land. The area  
 south of Islington had a very         
 sophisticated system of drainage. The 
 object of this system was to enable   
 grass to be grown earlier in the      
 spring.These systems have been        
 abandoned because of the large amounts
 of skilled labour required to keep    
 them working.                         
  {Gravel:}are of little agricultural  
 use and are covered by heathlands.    
  {Chalk:}is usually used for sheep    
 grazing.
