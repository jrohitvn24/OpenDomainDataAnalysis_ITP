		<title>06FARMING IN WOOLSTON/THELWALL</title>
		<content>   There is very little useful farmland
 in this area.                         
                                       
   What useful land there is lies      
 either at the North Eastern or South  
 Eastern edges of the block. The best  
 land is found in the former area. Both
 root crops and cereals can be found   
 growing on land bordering the road    
 from Warrington to Manchester.        
                                       
   In the South the land can best be   
 described as{rough pasture.}A number  
 of fields are given over to grazing   
 for horses. In fact there are a couple
 of Riding Schools in this area.       
                                       
   As has been stated before the       
 majority of undeveloped land in this  
 block is of little or no agricultural 
 use.                                  
                                       </content>
