		<content> St.Joseph's first school is situated  
 about 200m. along the road from the   
 middle school.It is a{Roman Catholic} 
 first school and has about 50 pupils. 
 Most of the children transfer to      
 Brockhurst Middle School at the age of
 8 years along with the other children 
 from the first schools at{Harborough  
{Magna}and{Brinklow.                   
  St.Joseph's school has two full time 
 teachers and two part time helpers,   
 one of which also helps out at the    
 middle school.Of the three first      
 schools St.Joseph's,due to its        
 proximity,has probably formed the     
 closest links with the middle school, 
 taking part in joint services at      
 Christmas and other times of the year 
 as well as sports and fund raising    
 functions.
