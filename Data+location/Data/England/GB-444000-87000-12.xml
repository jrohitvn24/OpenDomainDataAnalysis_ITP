		<title>12Change around Park Cross.</title>
		<content> In Norman times this area was a royal 
 hunting park and the word{'park'      
 continues  to exist in many of the    
 place names.Today it is almost        
 entirely{farmland}and it is likely to 
 remain so.In recent times several     
 farms have increased in size as some  
 of the smaller farms have ceased      
 farming and their fields have been    
 sold.It is likely that this trend     
 towards larger farms will continue.   
 Employment in the area suffered when  
 the cigarette lighter factory on the  
 Dixon's site finally closed in 1983   
 and it remains vacant.There has been  
 some new housing development on the   
 site of an old brickworks at Gunville 
 but large scale development is        
 unlkely.Although the railway closed in
 1953 public transport remains fairly  
 good as the area is served by the bus 
 routes to the West Wight.             </content>
