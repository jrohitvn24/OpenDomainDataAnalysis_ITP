		<title>12HOUSING IN BURNHAM MARKET 1</title>
		<content>     Burnham Market has 145 council    
 houses and all of them are in this    
 survey block. Most are on the Sutton  
 Estate: this includes Croft's Close   
 (attractive new terraced houses) and  
 Sutton Lea (17 warden controlled      
 bungalows for the elderly).           
                                       
    There are demands from some people 
 in the village for more council       
 housing to be built as young people   
 from local families cannot afford to  
 compete with purchasers of "holiday   
 cottages". However, the borough       
 council has only two families on the  
 waiting list for council houses in the
 village, regards the village as       
 well-provided with council houses and 
 cannot afford to build any more. Some 
 families have bought their houses from
 the council.
