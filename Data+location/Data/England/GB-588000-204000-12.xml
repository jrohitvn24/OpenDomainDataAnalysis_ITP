		<title>12TRANSPORT ON THE BLACKWATER</title>
		<content> Hundreds of years ago the Blackwater, 
 which is deep enough to take big ships
 was very important to the prosperity  
 of the area.In 1796 a canal was built 
 which allowed goods to be transported 
 by barge to Chelmsford. Coal,timber   
 and fertilizer were transported into  
 the area while hay and other farm     
 produce was transported out.Barges    
 used to collect grain from the farms  
 in Mundon and deliver it to the mills 
 along the river.                      
   At Iltney farm there is a disused   
 canal which was built by Marriages to 
 enable barges to collect the grain    
 they needed from the local farmers.   
    When the railway was built water   
 transport lost its importance. The    
 railway is now closed but the river   
 has not benefited. Now farm produce is
 transported by road hauliers.
