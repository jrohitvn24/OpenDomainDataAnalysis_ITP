		<title>20My Village.</title>
		<content> I like my village because my friends  
 and family live here.It is a nice     
 little village and has a very         
 interesting history.When I was small I
 lived in East Anglia,but when Iwas    
 three years old I moved to Esh        
 Winning.                              
   The things I like about the village 
 are the people as they are friendly   
 and kind.There are many woods and     
 forests to visit and explore.There are
 also many farms and hills to walk     
 around and lots of places to go sight 
 seeing.                               
    The things I dislike are the       
 vandalism and the robberies.Many      
 shrubs have been planted ,but there is
 a lot of graffiti.                    
      I would like to see a leisure    
 centre in our village with a swimming 
 pool,ski slope,gym,ice rink and roller
 rink.                                 </content>
