		<content> Mr Wilks has owned this LOCAL INDUSTRY
 for the last 5 yrs, but only uses half
 the 12.5 acres, as a sitting tenant is
 on the other half. Originally the     
 area was a watercress bed connected to
 the River Gade and the soil contains  
 fertile silt. Mr Wilks was attracted  
 by the countryside and nearby lake.   
 Of the 11 EMPLOYEES at the centre     
 most have been trained at High        
 Wycombe and those who work with the   
 plants have all been to Agricultural  
 College.                              
 Customers come from a 20 mile radius  
 to buy the PLANTS and SHRUBS, half of 
 which were originally grown at the    
 nursery but are now bought from other 
 centres or imported from Europe.      
 Plants and shrubs are sold on a       
 seasonal basis. 2 years ago the main  
 building was extended and planning    
 permission granted to develop the lake</content>
