		<title>13LIFE IN LIFTON</title>
		<content> I have lived in{LIFTON}for fourteen   
 years. We live in a council house     
 which we are now buying. The council  
 estate was built to{RE-HOUSE}people   
 who lived in the main street. The     
 main street was very narrow and they  
 knocked down the houses to widen the  
 road. Since then two more estates have
 have been built, {CHURCHLANDS }and{   
{ARUNDELL GARDENS.                     
{LIFTON}has many {CLUBS}for people to  
 enjoy. I belong to{LIFTON BADMINTON   
{CLUB,}of which i am {CHAIRMAN.}I enjoy
 walking. There are many walks around{ 
{LIFTON}and along the{RIVER BANKS.}    
   Altogether{LIFTON}is a very nice    
 place to live in.                     
   We hope to be moving to the         
 country-side next year.
