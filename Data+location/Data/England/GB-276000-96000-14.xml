		<content> When we went silaging at{Shortacombe  
{Farm}we got there by mini bus. First  
 we looked at the silage pit or clamp. 
 Then we looked at the forage harvester
 and we were told how it worked. It    
 picks up grass, then it is chopped up 
 and comes out as a spout and goes into
 a trailer which is hitched behind.    
 When the trailer is full a tractor and
 empty trailer comes and the empty     
 trailer takes the place of the full   
 trailer. The tractor and full trailer 
 go to the pit to empty. When the      
 trailer is emptied the buck rake      
 pushes the grass into the pit. The    
 empty trailer goes to the forage      
 harvester and it happens all over     
 again. The mower conditioner cuts the 
 grass and snaps it and squeezes some  
 of the sap out. The silage is used to 
 feed cows, bullocks and bulls in the  
 winter time.                          </content>
