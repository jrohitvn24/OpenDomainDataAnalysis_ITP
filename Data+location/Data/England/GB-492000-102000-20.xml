 Bognor Regis.Barnham has become       
 increasingly more popular.Barnham     
 railway station is a major junction   
 for trains from London and the South  
 Coast.The area consists of mainly very
 flat farmland.St.Philip Howard High   
 School is becoming very popular with  
 an increasing number of pupils.Also in
 the area are two primary schools      
 called Barnham and Aldingbourne       
 Junior.There are two main historic    
 monuments here.St.Mary's Church which 
 is about 900 years old.The old        
 canal was built in 1840 but was unused
 due to the construction of the        
 railway.Other features include 8      
 nurseries,3 caravan parks and 2 pig   
 farms.The Water works is situated     
 South of the canal and the sewage
