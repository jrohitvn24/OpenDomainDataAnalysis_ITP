		<content>Mr Smith told us that the road which   
leads to Arncott was not there when he 
came here,it was built in 1942\3 &amp; his 
garage was built in 1950.It used to be 
a Shell station but is now a National  
station.He also owns Bicester Plant    
Hire employing 22 people &amp; 11 at the   
garage.The petrol comes in lorries from
Thame &amp; he sells about 800gallons a day
This year he sold 28 Renault cars.He   
has2 cars of his own &amp; mends 9or10 cars
a day.There are 10 cars for sale.When  
he bought the garage 35 years ago it   
didn't have a porch at the front &amp; was 
very unmodern.   (VICTORIA STUBBS).    
 WORKING AT THE GARAGE. First you have 
to clock in then you get your overalls 
on,then you decide which job you're    
going to do.You have to service cars &amp; 
mend broken cars.Then you go &amp; test to 
make sure there is nothing wrong with  
them.You go home at 5pm. (J WOODHOUSE).</content>
