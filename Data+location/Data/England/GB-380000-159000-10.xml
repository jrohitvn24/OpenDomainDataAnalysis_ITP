		<content>  Most children start their education  
 at one of the many small private      
 pre-school playgroups in the town.    
 Children transfer to the large        
 comprehensive school at the age of    
 eleven and can leave at sixteen though
 many stay on until the age of         
 eighteen. Many adults continue their  
 education by following part time      
 courses and the new Mount Pleasant    
 Community Centre is used for day      
 classes whilst schools are used for   
 evening classes. Courses in yoga,     
 physical fitness and dance seem       
 popular at present. Parents take a    
 very keen interest in their children's
 education and parent/teacher          
 association activities are very well  
 supported.
