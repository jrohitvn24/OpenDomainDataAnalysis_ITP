		<title>09CAISTOR MARKET PLACE TOILETS</title>
		<content>  Public toilets were erected in       
 Caistor market place in 1961 after a  
 long debate concerning their location.
  Vandalism of the toilets has got     
 progressively worse since they became 
 the meeting place for groups of       
 youths,and many local people consider 
 the toilet block an eyesore in an     
 otherwise quaint market square.       
  Campaigns for their removal led by   
{The Caistor Society, Mrs.M.Drakes and 
 Mr.A. Baker, secretary{Caistor Labour 
{Party}has been going on since 1979.The
 issue was raised at{West Lindsey      
{District Council}who suggested the    
 toilets should be locked after 4.30pm.
 After a Labour Party petition was     
 presented,the District Council        
 relented and agreed to their          
 demolition and relocation,probably    
 behind the magistrates court.         
 The block was demolished in July 1985.</content>
