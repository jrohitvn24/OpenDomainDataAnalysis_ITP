		<content>   This main road crosses the survey   
 block east-west.Periodic improvements 
 over the last 15 years have made it   
 into a dual carriageway which can only
 be crossed or joined in one place.Its 
 function within the national transport
 infrastructure is to carry people and 
 goods speedily between London and the 
 South West.Its effect however on this 
 locale has been to act as a barrier   
 both physically and mentally.To the   
 north goods and services are centred  
 on North Cadbury and Castle Cary while
 to the south Sherborne and Wincanton  
 are the focal centres.The division    
 north-south is also reflected in      
 social activities.North Cadbury with  
 its village hall and church provides a
 centre for bazaars,whist drives,flower
 festivals and amatuer dramatics for   
 Woolston whereas Maperton is the      
 centre for such events south of A303. </content>
