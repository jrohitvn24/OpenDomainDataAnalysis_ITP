		<content>    l overslept and was woken at 9pm + 
 rushed to get to church by 9.45am. l  
 am in the choir and my sisters go to  
 Sunday School. The service went well  
 with good hymns and the Vicar's sermon
 was on community care being an        
 important witness. Daddy did not come 
 to Church but sat in the garden with  
 Grandma.                              
   Mummy prepared lunch and I went to  
 my room to do College work. Lunch was 
 my favourite - roast chicken, potatoes
 stuffing and vegetables followed      
 by lemon cheesecake.                  
   My sister and l avoided washing up  
 by taking the dog for a long walk to  
 Bolderford Bridge. Then I finished my 
 College work while my sisters made    
 rock buns for tea which we ate in the 
 garden. We played in the garden until 
 dusk and then watched TV until about  
 10p.m. - Bedtime.                     </content>
