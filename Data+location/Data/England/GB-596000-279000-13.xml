		<title>13HARVEST, RIDDLESWORTH</title>
		<content> Our Harvest Festival took place on    
 Monday 7th October, l985 at Riddles-  
 worth Church sponsored by Band Aid, a 
 pop group who are raising money to    
 help starving people in the Third     
 World.  Riddlesworth School gave split
 peas, lentils, flour, sugar and rice. 
 We carried it into the church and     
 packed it into sacks to be taken by   
 road and then ship to Africa, thence  
 to Ethiopia, Sudan and other poor     
 countries.  The church was packed as  
 people contribted food for the poor.  
 As the rector walked in to start the  
 service, we sang a harvest hymn,said a
 short prayer and then heard a reading 
 about the loaves and fishes.  The     
 service was held to help those who are
 not so well off as we are.  This was  
 our chance to help those poor starving
 adults and children and give them a   
 really good Christmas.                </content>
