		<title>13CHANGING TIMES</title>
		<content> By{1925}things had begun to change.   
 There was still a shop but the        
 pubs had closed down because the      
 miners left the area. The schools     
 in Crowan were now closed but a new   
 one had been built in Praze for       
 boys and girls from the age of five   
 to fourteen years. This school is     
 still used today. Crowan still had    
 no mains water, it still came from    
 a spring. There was still no          
 electricity. People cooked on         
{cornish ranges}and used oil lamps.    
 A few people still did mining but     
 most people were involved in farming. 
 People still travelled in horse and   
 carts and jingles. People took jugs   
 to a farm to get the milk. The        
 village was about the same size as    
 it is now. The mill still worked and  
 the blacksmith was still overworked.
