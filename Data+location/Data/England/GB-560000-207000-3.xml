		<title>03TYE HALL &amp; ELMS FARM,ROXWELL</title>
		<content>     The farm is jointly owned by      
 three people. It covers about 400     
 acres of land. Until recently they had
 a herd of dairy cows but these have   
 been sold because too much milk has   
 been produced in this country. There  
 are still fifty beef animals. This    
 year the farmer is growing 230 acres  
 of wheat 90 acres of barley 30 acres  
 of potatoes and 60 acres of vining    
 peas. Contractors bring their own     
 machinery to cut the peas.            
     There is a lot of machinery on the
 farm including a combine harvester,   
 seven tractors , four ploughs and     
 seven trailers. They grow willow trees
 to make cricket and rounders bats.    
     Sweet chestnut,Silver Birch and   
 Rowan trees have been planted because 
 the elm trees have died. The barns and
 sheds are painted and well cared for.
