   The Leeds-Liverpool Canal is one of 
the main features of this D-Block. Just
over four miles of this 127 mile       
waterway winds its way through the     
block linking Clayton-le-Moors, Church 
and Rishton, passing through farmland  
an industrial areas.  A walk along the 
towpath shows that the prosperity of   
the 'Canal Age' is long gone.          
Buildings, once hives of activity, lie 
silent, falling into disrepair - some  
with the decaying machinery still      
inside.  There are however signs that  
the canal is waking up again.  Fish are
now to be found in the once polluted   
water.  Cruisers and converted barges  
ply their way with clutches of canoes. 
Old buildings are slowly giving way to 
new indutries and housing, injecting a 
fresh life to a much neglected area.
