Orchestra have included works by       
Sibelius and Tchaikovsky in this year's
repertoire.                            
Many concerts are organised throughout 
the year,{Birmingham Town Hall}being a 
popular venue. The Concert Orchestra   
did extremely well in a{Youth Festival}

orchestras. Birmingham is very         
fortunate in it's opportunities for    
music making.                          </content>
