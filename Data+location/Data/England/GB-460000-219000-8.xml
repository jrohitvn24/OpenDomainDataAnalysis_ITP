will go to a Secondary School until I'm

which is how it got its name.Our school
buildings are split into 2 departments:
four Infants' classes for the 5\7      
year-olds &amp; 6 Junior classes for the   
8\11yr-olds.We arrive at 8.55am &amp;leave

morning,except Friday when we go swim- 
ming in Bicester Pool, we have Assembly

sing hymns in the 2 Halls.On Wednesdays
have games in the hall or on the field.
On Thursdays we haveArt &amp; Craft when we
