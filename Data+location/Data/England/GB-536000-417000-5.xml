		<title>05FISHING IN THE HUMBER</title>
		<content>{ FISHING}At Skeffling fishermen       
 put their nets out onto the mudflats  
 of the River Humber known as Spurn    
 Bight                                 
{ METHOD}The nets are placed about half
 a mile out in the river at low tide.  
 They  are about eight metres long with
 buoys or floats tied to them.         
   The fishermen put down nets and wait
 for the tide to come back in and with 
 it the fish. Then the fish swim       
 into the net and get stuck. When the  
 tide goes out again the fishermen can 
 go back and bring in the nets and     
 fish.Then they wash the fish in the   
 nearby drain,put them into boxes      
 and take them home.                   
{ FISH CAUGHT}The kinds of fish they   
 catch are plaice,eels,flatfish and    
 some shellfish.
