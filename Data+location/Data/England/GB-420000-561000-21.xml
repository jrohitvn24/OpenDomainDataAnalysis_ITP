<title>21Dunston redevelopment</title>
<content>

The sports and leisure centre referred to in the 1986 article is still doing well as the Dunston Activity Centre, still providing things for local people to do. The Derwent Tower (the "Rocket") was unpopular then and still remains unpopular despite being an easily recognised local landmark, visible from miles around. Dunston's future will be "rocket-less" though as demolition is underway to redevelop the tower and its surrounding housing. Dunston has many homes built over many years from the 1800s, all pretty much still providing good quality housing for local people. It's a shame that the bright new concrete future foreseen during the 1960s has failed to survive into this century.   &lt;br />
