		<title>07The Orlit Estate Great Lever</title>
		<content> The Orlit prefab houses were built by 
 the council in the late l940's. Over  
 the years there have been complaints  
 about dampness, cold and condensation.
 2 years ago a{Tenants' Association}was
 formed to deal with problems affecting
 the community e.g. housing and street 
 repairs,lack of play facilities, glue 
 sniffing etc.{Street Leaders}were     
 appointed to visit and help their     
 neighbours. They also collect 20p per 
 week from the residents, subscriptions
 which pay for events such as childrens
 parties &amp; day trips to Blackpool, fun 
 days during the holidays, dances for  
 old people, fancy-dress football etc. 
 A{Cub Pack}was started for boys aged  
 7-10 and weekly meetings are held at  
 Lever Edge County Primary School.
