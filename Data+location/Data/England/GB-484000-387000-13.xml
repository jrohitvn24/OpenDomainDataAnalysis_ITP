		<title>13Village Life. Robert Winters</title>
		<content>  The second person who we went to     
 visit as part of our Domesday Survey  
 was Robert Winters a boy who lives at 
 Heapham a village in our area.        
  He has always lived in the same      
 bungalow with his father, mother and  
 older brother. He is nine years old   
 and his birthday is on 21st. January. 
 He goes to school in Corringham which 
 is two and a half miles away. On      
 school days he gets up at half past   
 seven and eats cereals for breakfast. 
 When he is ready for school he catches
 the bus at half past eight and it     
 takes him fifteen minutes to get to   
 school. This gives him enough time to 
 play games before school starts at a  
 quarter past nine. His best friend is 
 Daniel Burgess and he lives in        
 Corringham. This means it is difficult
 for them to see each other outside of 
 school.                {See next page.</content>
