		<title>20MY LIFE BY CLAIRE WALLER</title>
		<content> In my life I like to play with my     
 friends and watch TV. On Monday I go  
 to school and I do recorder lessons   
 with Mrs. Coslett.  We go home at     
 quarter past three and I play with    
 Joanna Clark next door and we go over 
 to the pond and to the church yard and
 I play in my room and I play football 
 with my brother sometimes.            
 On Tuesday I have games and I go to   
 Brownies on Tuesday at half past six  
 and we go home at 7.3O pm.            
 On Wednesday we go swimming and if    
 it's sunny I go in the garden and play
 with my brother sometimes.            
 On Thursday Father Floate comes and we
 sing songs and do games or country    
 dancing.
