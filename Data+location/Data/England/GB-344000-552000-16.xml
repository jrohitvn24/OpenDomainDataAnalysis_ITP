		<title>16A talk with some of our mums</title>
		<content>   On Saturday my mum normally has a   
 long lie in bed. Dad some times does  
 too, but very often he gets up and    
 makes the breakfast.When my mum       
 eventually gets up she does some of   
 the little jobs round the house that  
 need doing then she makes lunch. We   
 have a light lunch on Saturdays.      
   In the afternoon mum sometimes taks 
 us out with dad but most times we just
 stay at home.Mum and dad enjoy playing
 with us in the garden and they also   
 take us for walks. there are some     
 lovely walks along the banks of the   
 River Eden.Mum loves gardening, she is
 always doing something like weeding or
 sowing seeds or just poking about.    
   In the middle of the week mum goes  
 to "Keep Fit."At the weekend she      
 sometimes goes out for a meal or a    
 drink or goes to a party with my dad.
