		<content> She has lived in Portchester for      
 twenty three years.  She sees her main
 problem in life as worrying about her 
 children and what the future holds for
 them.                                 
 To her, the main national problem is  
 that many people expect to be kept by 
 the State instead of standing on their
 own two feet.  To solve this she would
 introduce benefit reforms ie cease    
 Child Benefit payments, reduce        
 Supplementary Benefits and create     
 community jobs for the unemployed     
 instead of giving them benefit        
 payments.                             
 The main local issues are housing and 
 recreational facilities.  She would   
 like to see more retirement homes and 
 better recreational facilities.       
 She hopes for a peaceful world        
 community and more respect from abroad
 which we have lost in her life time.  </content>
