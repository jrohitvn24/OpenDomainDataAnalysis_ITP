		<content> a){The Blacksmith's Forge}unused for  
 many years, now produces artistic     
 metal work. This is mainly for        
 individual commissions for            
 customers from all over the country.  
 b){Many small farms}in the area have  
 become part of a Company with a       
 manager in each main unit.            
 c){A 600 yard section of the Hereford 
{and Gloucester Canal,}unused for 100  
 years, has been dug out and filled by 
 electric pump with water from the     
 nearby River Leadon, assistance having
 been given by the local Water         
 Authority. Three ponds have been      
 stocked with trout for{fly-fishing    
 and three with{coarse fish.}Regular   
 clients pay daily to fish and later on
 local clubs will hire the coarse fish 
 ponds for fishing matches. When the   
 new bungalow is built on site, a trout
 hatchery will be developed.           </content>
