		<title>05BLAGDON VILLAGE CLUB.</title>
		<content>    FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS BLAGDON 
 HAS HAD A VILLAGE CLUB. THE CLUBHOUSE 
 IS ON THE BATH ROAD GOING THROUGH     
 BLAGDON.IT WAS BUILT BECAUSE THE      
 VILLAGERS NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO MEET AND
 TO RELAX. VILLAGE MEETINGS ARE HELD   
 THERE OTHER WEEK.                     
    IN THE GAMES ROOM YOU CAN PLAY     
 SNOOKER, AMERICAN POOL AND TABLE      
 TENNIS. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS STOPPING BY 
 FOR A GAME OF SNOOKER. THE PEOPLE WHO 
 RUN THE CLUB ARE CALLED MR. AND MRS   
 BROWN. THEY ARE VERY NICE AND THEY    
 RUN IT WELL. EVERY YEAR THEY HOLD A   
 DISCO.                                
    THE CLUB HAS CHANGED A LOT OVER THE
 YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, A PATIO HAS JUST  
 BEEN BUILT FOR PEOPLE TO SIT IN THE   
 SUN. IT LOOKS VERY NICE NOW WITH      
 FLOWERS ALL AROUND IT. BLAGDON VILLAGE
 CLUB IS USED A LOT.I ALWAYS ENJOY IT  
 WHEN I GO TO THE CLUB.                </content>
