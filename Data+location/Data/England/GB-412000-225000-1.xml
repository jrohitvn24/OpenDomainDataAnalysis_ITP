		<title>01Country near Condicote Lane</title>
		<content> This rural area is situated between   
 165-235 metres up near Stow on the    
 Wold on the Oolitic Limestone of the  
 North Cotswold in the county of       
 Gloucestershire. Quarrying that       
 limestone is the only industry.       
 Arable farming by affluent landowners 
 is the main land coverage. Some       
 animals are also kept. There are 5    
 farmhouses with workers' cottages.    
 Houses no longer required for         
 agricultural workers are now tenanted 
 or let.                               
 Population is sparse and isolated. The
 Heythrop Foxhounds hunt over this     
 country.                              
 Roads are narrow country lanes except 
 for 2 km of the B4077.                
 The ancient track running N-S is known
 as Condicote Lane. Tumuli and long    
 barrows show evidence of man's        
 previous occupation of the area.      </content>
