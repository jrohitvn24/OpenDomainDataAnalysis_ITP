		<title>01REVIEW OF BAYSTON HILL</title>
		<content>    The block is predominately         
 agricultural and crossed by several   
 minor roads that pass through the     
 villages of Hook-a-gate, Annscroft,   
 Longden and Bayston Hill and serve    
 outlying farms and houses.            
    Bayston Hill is now a suburb of    
 Shrewsbury.The development of the     
 village has taken place on the        
 opposite side of the A49 from the     
 original village leaving it isolated. 
 It is a commuter village with most    
 people working in Shrewsbury.         
    Lyth Hill is a local beauty spot   
 offering a superb  panorama of the    
 surrounding area.                     
    Farming is mainly arable with wheat
 as the main crop.There is very little 
 permanent pasture.                    
    The few business concerns other    
 than shops are outside our area.
