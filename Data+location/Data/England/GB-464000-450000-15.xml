		<content>   Animal auctions are held at York    
 Livestock Centre. It was for many     
 years just outside the York city walls
 but when that area was re-developed,  
 in 1971, the centre was moved to its  
 present position 3 miles East of York 
 near to the by-pass, giving easy      
 access.                               
    Farmers  have attended auctions    
 from as far away as Lincolnshire,     
 Cheshire and Middlesbrough. An average
 attendance is 2000 farmers.           
    Monday auctions are for slaughter  
 and Thursday for store animals.       
 Dalgety Meat's abattoir is near-by.   
 The maximum number of cattle each week
 is about 1000 though it usually about 
 600, with 2500 pigs and 1000 sheep.   
    The maximum price paid was Â£8400   
 for a pedigree cow and calf.          
    On sale days 3 banks open, and 6   
 shops of agricultural needs and a bar.</content>
