     There has been a school on the    
 present site since before the war. We 
 found that many older local people    
 went to the school. They and the local
 shop-keepers are very kind to us and  
 are pleased to help us when we have   
 jumble sales, summer fairs and so on. 
                                       
     At school we have many different  
 sorts of assemblies. In November we   
 have a Divali assembly when we        
 remember the story of Rama and Sita   
 and the festival of light. We make    
 little lights with candles. In        
 December we enjoy the story of the    
 birth of Jesus, and we have parties.  
 At the end of Ramadhan we celebrate   
 Eid.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
