		<title>17THE CHURCHES OF WARMINSTER</title>
		<content> Warminster has 8 churches. Canon      
 Johnson, Vicar of the largest church, 
 St Denys, runs 10 services a week and 
 sees an average Sunday attendance of  
 105-135. Among his special services in
 1984 were 20 weddings, 40 funerals, 45
 christenings and 20 confirmations. The
 congregations include all ages: the   
 old outnumber the young but many young
 people take part in Sunday Schools and
 Church Youth Clubs. Warminster has    
 several choirs, and Churches run many 
 other activities, from women's groups 
 to bell ringing. Ministers go into    
 schools, visit the sick and play an   
 active part in the community. Recently
 the local United Reformed Church had  
 to amalgamate with the Methodists due 
 to a declining congregation, but Canon
 Johnson, speaking from 17 years'      
 experience as Vicar,believes that the 
 Churches have a flourishing future.   </content>
