		<content>   I (Amy) live on a farm.We have pigs,
 chickens,cows,beef cattle and a goose.
 We have 80 sows,5 boars, and approx.  
 650 fattening pigs.The sows farrow 2  
 and half times a year and rear 22-23  
 piglets a year.The piglets are weaned 
 from their mothers at three weeks and 
 they are put into pens of 20-25 pigs. 
 They are fed dry meal consisting of   
 ground barley and protein concentrate.
 When they are 4 months old they weigh 
 about 63 kg and are then sent for     
 slaughter.As pork they produce a      
 carcase of 50 Kg.The weaned sows are  
 put with boars and should be served   
 within a week;the gestation period is 
 about  4 months.We have 2 house       
 cows,served by a beef bull.They rear  
 their own calves and a bought in calf.
 They give us milk for the house and   
 baby pigs. We have 8 chickens which   
 supply us with eggs.                  </content>
