		<content> Hyde and Denton are small market towns
 to the East of Manchester.They are    
 separated by the River Tame which once
 separated Lancashire from Cheshire and
 now gives its name to the whole area  
 of Tameside.They owe their initial    
 growth to the,once thriving hatting   
 and cotton industries.These have      
 seriously declined.In addition to the 
 industrial premises,large  and small, 
 there are shops, several large super- 
 markets and two town markets. The     
 periferal areas are residential.The   
 last decade has seen the improvement  
 of our linear park,the{Tame Valley    
 as a recreational area.Much new       
 planting has been done, paths laid,   
 trails clearly marked and picnic areas
 provided. The enjoyment of these,     
 however, is dependant  upon the       
 cleaning of the highly polluted River 
 Tame.{                                </content>
