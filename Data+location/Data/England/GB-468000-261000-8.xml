		<content>                                       
 Anglian Water Board own the 1 1/2     
acre site on  which the 60 feet high   
water tower stands. It is made of      
reinforced concrete &amp; is 35 years old. 
                                       
The water travels from Pitsford        
Reservoir, where it has been filtered  
&amp; chlorinated, in a 700 mm pipe. Close 
to the water tower some water is       
diverted from this main pipe into a    
400 mm pipe which fills the water      
tower. The pure water is stored for    
normally 24 hours &amp; is then used to    
supply Harpole and some of Duston. The 
tower stores 250,000 gallons of water. 
                                       
 The area surrounding the water tower  
is made secure by high fencing.        
Inside, on ground floor level, it is   
used for storage.
