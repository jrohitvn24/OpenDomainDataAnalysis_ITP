		<title>14POPULATION IN CHELWOOD GATE</title>
		<content> The population in Chelwood Gate is    
 700-800 people of all ages. Most of   
 the people live in the Beaconsfield   
 Road area. There are families who have
 lived in the area for generations,    
 either on small holdings or tied      
 cottages. There are manual workers,   
 casual workers and people working in  
 local shops, pubs and hotel, profes-  
 sionals, industrialists, businessmen, 
 office workers, servicemen and a few  
 titled people and landowners. Some re-
 tired people remain in their own      
 homes, others can go to the Beacon Old
 Peole's Home and some have to go to   
 hospital or homes outside the village.
 There is a burial ground in Dane Hill 
 which serves the two villages, or else
 cremation takes place outside the     
 area.
