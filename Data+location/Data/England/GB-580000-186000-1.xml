		<title>01Landscape:Drainage &amp; Relief.</title>
		<content>   Hadleigh and North-West Leigh-on-Sea
 lie on a{plateau}60m. above sea-level 
 which slopes gently to the east.      
   This plateau is drained by the      
{Prittle Brook,}which rises near West  
 Wood and flows eastwards. Once in     
 Leigh it becomes a concrete-lined     
 conduit for much of its course through
 Southend-on-Sea until it joins the    
 River Roach at Rochford. The brook has
 cut a shallow valley which gives a    
 slight relief to the otherwise almost 
 flat plateau surface.                 
   To the south of Hadleigh, sloping   
 down to the Thames Estuary are the    
{Hadleigh Downs.}From this degraded    
 cliff-line of the River Thames, there 
 is a sweeping view across the estuary 
 to Kent. Local people, especially dog 
 owners,like to walk along these downs.
