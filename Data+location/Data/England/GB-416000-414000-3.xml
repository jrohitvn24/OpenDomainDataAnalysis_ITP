		<content>    The{Molly Carr Wood Sing}was       
 started in l9OO by Zion Methodists.   
 On Whit Sunday mornings, people walk  
 through the bluebells in the wood, and
 sing hymns.  A count is taken and     
 breakfast is served after the sing.   
{Local dialect}                        
    People say the Yorkshire dialect   
 is dying out. Only the old ones still 
 know many dialect words.  These words 
 go back hundreds of years, before     
 modern English was spoken.  Here are  
 just a few we know (we have not seen  
 them written down, so the spelling is 
 based on the sound): addle - to earn; 
 agait - doing, going; baht - without; 
 brass - money; fettle - to clean (n.  
 in good condition);  happen - perhaps;
 lake - to play; mither - to bother;   
 oss -to move, to try; poise - to      
 kick.
