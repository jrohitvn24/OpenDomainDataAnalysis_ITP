 For breakfast I have Rice Crispies    
 followed by yoghurt.When I am ready it
 is about 8.30.I arrive at school about
 8.40.Then we have various lessons like
 maths,english or unfinished work.We go
 to assembly every day except Thursday 
 when we have radio assembly.Afterwards
 we go out for break and play football 
 unless we have wet play when I        
 draw.Then we do maths or english.We   
 have lunch at 12.00.After lunch we    
 have break but some people go to      
 Computer Club.Play ends at 1.25 and we
 do various things such as topic,art or
 games.For games we play soccer        
 depending on the time of year.At 3.30 
 we go home.After school I do my       
 homework and play with my friend Gye  
 on bikes.At about 9.00 I go to bed.
