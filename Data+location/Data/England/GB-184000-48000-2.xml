		<title>02HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was opened in St Erme in   
 1878 following the 1870 education act.
 Four years later a small extention was
 added as there was know_where for them
 to hang and dry their coats.At the    
 opening there were fifty children on  
 roll.It was common for children to    
 bring pasties to school for their     
 dinner.These would be placed on top of
 the coal burning stove to be heated   
 during the morning.                   
 The numbers in school varied but by   
 the middle 1970's had dropped below   
 30.Then some development began and    
 numbers rose.In 1980 a mobile         
 classroom was added,to be followed by 
 another in 1983.The following year a  
 field was purchased as the site of a  
 new school,but cut backs in spending  
 mean this will not be built in the    
 near future.A mobile office was added 
 in 1985.The roll will soon excede 100.</content>
