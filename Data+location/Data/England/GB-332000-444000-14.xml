		<title>14FLEETWOOD FISHING INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Since the Icelandic cod wars,         
 Fleetwood has declined.Another reason 
 for the decline of this industry is   
 the closure of the Icelandic fishing  
 ground.The unloading of trawlers was  
 originally done by baskets,winches and
 trestels now the modern method is to  
 use pumps and conveyerbelts.          
   Fleetwood fishes off the west coast 
 of Scotland catching hake.When this   
 became scarce they depended on cod and
 plaice.                               
  The transport has changed over the   
 years,it was originally transported by
 rail,now it is transported by road    
 around the country. Merchants have    
 changed from wholesale to retail.The  
  catch of fish is: 15 KIT = 1 TONNE   
 Ice land back at sea 1200 KIT         
 Home water 15 days   750  KIT         
 Inshore 6 days       100  KIT         
 Small inshore 24hours 10  KIT         </content>
