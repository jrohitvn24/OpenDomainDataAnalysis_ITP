      Every year we have a school fete.
                                       
      This year was a very good fete.  
 Like always we have a cake stall and  
 this year we had some Jersey cows at  
 the fete, but we had some other good  
 things as well like a tug of war and a
 fancy dress cometition.               
                                       
      We had the computer this year to 
 play different games on and guess the 
 teachers knees that was very hard.    
                                       
      We had toffee apples, home made  
 sweets and popcorn.                   
                                       
      There was a game where you had to
 get the ball into the jar and then you
 won a fish.
