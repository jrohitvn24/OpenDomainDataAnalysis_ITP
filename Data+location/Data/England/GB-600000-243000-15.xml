		<title>15HADLEIGH BYPASS</title>
		<content>  The Hadleigh Bypass was designed by  
the Suffolk County Council as part of a
programme of road improvements to      
relieve towns and villages of heavey   
traffic.It is approximately 4km long   
and extends from Coram Street Farm to  
Lady Lane on the A1071.                
  Work began September 1982 and lasted 
for about 15 months.It was built by    
J.Breheny Contractors Ltd.of Needham   
Market and cost about 1.4 million      
pounds to build                        
  During the works 220,000 cubic       
metres of earth were moved and 42,000  
square metres of new road surface was  
laid.Two large culverts had to be      
placed under the embankments where the 
road crosses the River Brett.          
  The Hadleigh Bypass has made the town
alot quieter because all the heavy     
vehicles are directed away from the    
narrow and busy High Street.           </content>
