		<content>   The farmhouses are not only isolated
 geographically but also in terms of   
 public services and amenities.Most now
 have mains electricity,though not     
 all;the odd one or two still have     
 their own generators.They all need    
 their own private water supply and    
 sewage system.Until quite recent times
 hand pumps were still in operation,   
 pumping water from old wells.Today    
 some farms have their own boreholes   
 sunk into the sand stone, to a depth  
 of up to two hundred feet,and the     
 water is pumped up electrically into  
 the farm houses.Some, however, still  
 use the wells that have been in       
 existence since the house was erected,
 which more often than not, was over   
 two hundred years ago.There is no gas 
 at all in the area.
