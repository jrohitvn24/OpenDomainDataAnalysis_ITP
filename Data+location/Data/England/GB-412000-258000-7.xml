		<content>    Mr.Bullock was a tennant for 45    
 years then decided to buy the 84 acre 
 farm two years ago.He has 30 acres of 
 arable and 50 acres of grass.He now   
 has 20 beef steers (which are 18      
 months old,)49 ewes,2 rams,66 lambs   
 and 1 sheep dog.He also has a pony    
 which he keeps for his daughter.      
    Mr.Bullock also grows crops like   
 barley and oats.                      
    The most common disease for sheep  
 is sheep scab.Mr.Bullock has to dip   
 the sheep twice a year.Sometimes a man
 comes to check to see if the sheep dip
 is clean after dipping the sheep. Mr. 
 Bullock usually gets up about 07:00   
 and goes to bed between 10 and 11     
 0,clock.Sheep are very profitable but 
 cows are not.Limousin and Friesian are
 the most common cows on that farm.
