		<title>19BUILDING MATERIALS</title>
		<content> Building materials used in the area   
 of Low Worsall,Low Middleton and the  
 surrounding farming communities follow
 much the same pattern throughout the  
 ages. A mixture of bricks,stone,timber
 and slate has been used. The older    
 properties were largely constructed   
 from 2 inch bricks and clay pantiles  
 or sometimes a little slate was       
 used.Both the bricks and pantiles     
 originated from Holland. Perhaps this 
 is evidence of the influence of       
 Piersburg Port of Low Worsall. In     
 contrast,modern buildings use a brick 
 8 by two and a half                   
 inches,wood,overlapping flat clay     
 tiles and a greater use is made of    
 glass and plastic.
