		<title>17WARD'S NURSERY/THE OLD FORGE</title>
		<content> The Ward family has been connected    
 with Sarrat for many years,with       
 woodland being planned and planted by 
 Frederick Ward early in this Century. 
 Ward's Nursery was previously a       
 chicken farm,but its use was changed  
 in 1933. The nursery now occupies 10  
 acres of land.                        
 Trees and shrubs form the greater     
 percentage of sales,with women forming
 the larger fraction of customers. The 
 busiest days at the nursery are at the
 weekend.                              
 THE OLD FORGE: On the wall outside the
 Old Forge,it has the date 1663. But   
 this has nothing to do with the house,
 as it was built in 1500. The Forge was
 extended in the 1920's. At the bottom 
 of the field belonging to the Forge   
 was a building which was used by a    
 witches' covern,this was burnt down by
 the villagers,early in this century.  </content>
