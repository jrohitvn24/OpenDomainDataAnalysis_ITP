		<content> Organised recreation is centred on    
 Halvergate. The village owns a sports 
 field which has a pavilion and a      
 licensed club room. This is a recent  
 aquisition. The main league sports are
 football, cricket, bowls and table    
 tennis. Tennis courts are being       
 developed.                            
 There is also a model aircraft club   
 with a predominantly adult membership.
 At the Public House in Halvergate,    
 darts, snooker, pool and cribbage are 
 regularly played. The primary school  
 at Halvergate involves children in    
 netball, football and rounders.       
 Gardening is popular in the area, as  
 is horse riding.
