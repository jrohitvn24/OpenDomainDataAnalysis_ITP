		<year>1986</year>
		<title>12         Employment</title>
		<content> These statistics are for May 1985 and 
 are based on a travel to work pattern.
 Whitstable has 90 job vacancies,(part 
 time work included).The unemployment  
 figures are 1029,(849 males &amp; 380     
 females),an increase of 10 from April.
 The figures have remained steady for  
 the past 4 years, but with Amphenol   
 making 90 people redundant this       
 balance will be upset. Tesco's Hyper- 
 market opening in 1986 may restore the
 balance. The present unemployment     
 figure averages at 12.5% which is the 
 National average.Most advertised      
 vacancies were for skilled workers and
 many were part time jobs.There were   
 vacancies for catering,office and     
 community workers.17 training courses 
 were advertised in the Job Centre.Many
 local people work in small factories  
 or service industries.A number commute
 to London and Canterbury.             </content>
