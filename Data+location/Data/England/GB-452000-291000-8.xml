		<content> Mr Evans is the principal of          
 Countesthorpe College.He is not only  
 in charge of 14_18 year old students, 
 but about 3000 other people.His       
 favourite part of his job is being    
 busy.1100 students attend the college.
 They usually gain more than they      
 lose,but 4th year areas are fuller    
 than 5th,because most 5th year        
 students leave after their exams.     
 There is not strict discipline at     
 Countesthorpe in the sense that they  
 don't have a lot of rules.There are no
 school colours because adults use the 
 school and they can't be told to wear 
 uniform. The students have the same   
 teachers for each subject.They are    
 divided into small schools.The staff  
 and pupils have a good relationship.  
 The pupils call staff by christian    
 names.The exam pass rate differs at   
 Countesthorpe.                        </content>
