<title>21Life on a Rock Ferry Estate</title>
<content>

Life on the estate hasnt changed much since 1986. Unemployment is still high as is poverty, but the people are happy and always will be come what may. The shop is still there and still run by the same family, the chip shop has changed ownership now for the better. The betting shop has now gone. Not sure if the candy floss man still comes round now and then, the ice cream man does. The houses have changed and now have double glazing, central heating and new kitchens, they still have a front and back garden. The park is at the back of the centre, which is two houses converted for use by the community and the park isnt as good as it used to be. The spirit of community is still alive and well.     &lt;br />
