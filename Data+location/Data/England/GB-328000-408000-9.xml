		<content> The busy{electric train}carrying      
 commuters, shoppers and summer        
 visitors stops at{Freshfield}on its   
 way between Liverpool and Southport.  
 Each train has three carriages and    
 during the rush hours, 7.00am-9.30am  
 and 4.00pm-6.00pm, they put on an     
 extra three. On average 170 people    
 travel on each carriage each day. The 
 engines are 507's and 508's. In the   
 winter a train puts down de-icer on   
 the live rail, and in the summer weed-
 killer. The reason for the weedkiller 
 is that the weeds have oil in them    
 which causes the train to slide past  
 the station. The biggest problem is   
 summer vandalism, this being one of   
 the reasons why there are no toilet   
 facilities at{Freshfield station.}Five
 people work here. Merseyside Passenger
 Transport Executive organizes the     
 trains.                               </content>
