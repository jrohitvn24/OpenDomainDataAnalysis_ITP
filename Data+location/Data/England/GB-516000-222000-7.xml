 House,Preston,in 1754.The house stood 
 on the site of Dinsley Castle,a 10th  
 century stronghold.After his retire_  
 ment from the army in 1763 Captain    
 Hinde settled in Preston and began to 
 convert the mansion into a castle,com_
 plete with turrets , portcullises and 
 battlements.Guns guarded the entrance 
 and fortifications were dug in the    
 grounds.The house was renamed Preston 
 Castle.Captain Hinde,the "General",   
 dressed his 17 children and other     
 village children in scarlet uniforms  
 and would lead his "army" into Hitchin
 on special occasions,assembling in the
 market place.Captain Hinde died in    
 1786 and Preston Castle was never oc_ 
 cupied again.It was demolished and    
 only Castle Farm,north of the village,
 remains as a reminder of the "General"
