		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My  name is Andrew Watts.I wake up at 
 8 o'clock.I look in my diary and I    
 say"Ace,its Thursday!" I like         
 Thursdays because the papers come.I   
 get out of bed,put my dressing gown on
 and slide down the bannisters.I pick  
 up the papers and I look at the"Your  
 Village News"section in the Wilts     
 Gazette and Herald and the "Kooky     
 Clown" section in the Devizes News.I  
 look for competitions and news about  
 my friends and relations.I then set   
 out the breakfast table and dad comes 
 in and says that I have forgotten the 
 margarine.After breakfast I race      
 upstairs and wake my sister           
 Catherine.At five to nine I start off 
 for school.At school everyone is      
 playing football except me.Miss       
 Preston comes out and lines us up and 
 we then go in and Mr.Jenkins does the 
 register.Then he tells us what we are </content>
