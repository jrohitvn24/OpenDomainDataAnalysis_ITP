		<title>18PARISH COUNCIL,WIVELISCOMBE</title>
		<content>     We went to see Mr Jones,a parish  
 councillor, to find out the concerns  
 of this area. He told us that the     
 parish councillor has the advantage of
 knowing the area, the people and their
 problems.                             
     One of the present concerns is the
 reduced car parking  in the centre of 
 Wiveliscombe since  London House, in  
 the Square, has been renovated,and    
 the appearance of the whole Square    
 enhanced. Local traders felt it was   
 affecting trade.                      
     He felt that transport in the area
 was meagre and expensive; of course   
 there have not been trains for many   
 years.Younger families have moved out 
 to Wellington, and elsewhere, for work
 and transport, while the number of    
 older people is growing.What would be 
 the future age balance in the         
 community? Would it affect schools?   </content>
