 Scouting is a world wide organisation 
 with over 17 million members.  Here   
 in the Bailiwick of Guernsey we have  
 13 Scout Groups in various parts of   
 the Island, with approximately 1000   
 Scouts and 134 leaders.  Scouting is  
 led in the Island by the Bailiwick    
 Commissioner, who is appointed by the 
 Chief Scout.                          
 We have a very fine Island Band and   
 good archery facilities.The sea scouts
 have over 50 boats to call on and the 
 air scouts have the cockpit of a      
 Monitor jet at their Island H.Q.      
 The Island Scouts are very lucky to   
 own a very fine H.Q. in the Vale which
 has 50 vergees of land,and a          
 farmhouse hostel with residential     
 facilities.
