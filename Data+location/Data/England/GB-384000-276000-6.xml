 them under glass,{plants and

 markets in Birmingham &amp; Wolverhampton.
      Kidney beans,broad               
 beans,lettuce,Dahlias and Sweet       
 Williams are grown outside while the  
 main crop inside is chrysanthemums,   
 400,000 annually,as well as 8,000     
 boxes of bedding plants.              
      Originally walled greenhouses 16 
 feet high were used to grow large     
 ferns but these wooden framed         
 buildings were completely destroyed by
 severe gales in January 1956.         
      Still on site is a 100 year old  
 steam engine used for steam

 Winter months.                        </content>
