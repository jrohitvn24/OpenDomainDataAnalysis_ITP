		<title>17Sport in Luddington</title>
		<content> Sport has always played a big part in 
 Luddington life.Presently there are   
 two football teams in the Scunthorpe  
 and District Saturday League and one  
 in the Sunday League,all playing their
 home fixtures by  the old church yard.
   Three years ago Luddington won the  
 Saturday League Challenge Cup while   
 the Sunday team,'Duffy's              
 Dynamos',formed only two seasons      
 ago,have won both the sixth and this  
 season the fifth division             
 championships.                        
   The Cricket Club has done equally as
 well,winning the Norman Axe Cup in    
 1983 and tying for top place in the   
 Isle of Axholme Evening League Trophy 
 last season.However they have a big   
 problem in that they have no home     
 pitch.Unfortunately the soccer breaks 
 up the only playing field so much that
 a wicket square cannot be levelled out</content>
