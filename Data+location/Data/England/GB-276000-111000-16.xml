		<title>16A CHILD'S DAY IN WORLINGTON</title>
		<content>{ BY SARAH                             
                                       
 I am 9 and live at Glebe Farm. I get  
 up at 6.30 and go outside to feed the 
 pigs and let the calves suck their    
 mums before I have breakfast. After   
 breakfast I go back to work cleaning  
 the yard and going to see the sheep   
 and bullocks. I have dinner then do   
 anything else that needs doing.If it  
 is school,I go to school after        
 breakfast.When my school day ends,I   
 go home and do some farm work while   
 mum and dad milk the cows.Then we all 
 have tea. After tea,I watch T.V. or go
 outside to help dad, then help mum to 
 get the goslings in. On weekdays, I go
 to bed about 8.pm. but on Saturdays I 
 go to bed at 9.pm. If it is lambing   
 season,dad gets up at midnight to     
 check the lambs.
