		<title>11Churchyard Poem.</title>
		<content> The churchyard is a dormant garden.   
 The graves show that man has been     
 here.                                 
 It reminds me of a different world,   
 Gives me a feeling of lonliness.      
 Really there are people surrounding   
 you,everywhere.                       
 You're not alone,the graves are there,
 For the remembrance of others,        
 And they are very close to you.       
                                       
 There are dark colours that make you  
 feel that all the world has lost its  
 brightness.                           
 Its like a wood with only a few trees,
 All the graves bending and twisting.  
 It gives me the feelings of a planet, 
 Far away from us,not an alien world,  
 But a place where our kind live.      
 A strangely lived existence,full of   
 mishappenings and dark futures.
