		<content>                                       
     At St. Elizabeths Church Sunday   
 ch we choose a Rose Queen each year.  
This year has been my turn. I was      
 crowned in August 1984 at the church  
gard. My dress was white satin with    
lace top and blue bows on the skirt. I 
hroyal blue velvet cloak with fur round
ge. Before I was crowned I wore a      
tiara. I had seven attendants and I    
bougll a present. When I had been      
crowned I had to make a speech.        
     During the year I have visited    
other queens and taken part in         
carnivals and processions.In March I   
held a Queens At Home at Aspull High   
School. About 150 people attended and a
sum of money was raised.This money     
went towards the church funds. My name 
is Ruth Atherton, and this has been an 
enjoyable year I shall always remember.
