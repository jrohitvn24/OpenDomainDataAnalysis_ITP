		<title>09SHOPPING IN OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> The children in our class have been   
 out doing a survey of the shops in our
 D-Block. We walked all the way along  
 Newchurch Road through Stacksteads    
 doing a tally of the different types  
 of shops. Nearly all of the shops in  
 Stacksteads are along the main road   
 and they are all quite small shops.   
 They are mostly food shops and there  
 are a few clothing shops and others   
 which sell everyday essentials. If    
 people want to do alot of shopping or 
 go to large stores or supermarkets    
 they go to Burnley or one of the big  
 towns. Bacup is very similar but with 
 a bit more choice and there is a small
 supermarket. There is also Woolworths,
 but this is closing down soon. Bacup  
 has a poor image and finds it         
 difficult to attract people and the   
 shops do not do very well.
