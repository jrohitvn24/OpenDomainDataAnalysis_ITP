 really enjoys his work.               
 He has various duties including;      
 re-making signs and fences,caring for 
 trees,shrubs and footpaths,picking up 
 litter and cleaning the toilets,taking
 school and coach parties on nature    
 tours,collecting money from the car   
 park pay boxes and running the park's 
 imformation centre.                   
     He works a forty hour week but    
 sometimes gets called out at the      
 weekend, particularly during the      
 summer. Although Mr Gorman likes his  
 work he is faced with many problems.  
 Some are natural,for example the two  
 hundred and fifty year old beech trees
 are so large many of the thick branch-
 es are breaking off under the strain.
