		<title>17COAL MINING</title>
		<content>{Coal}was discovered in the area around
 1226,when surface outcrops began to be
 mined simply by digging up the coal   
 out of the ground.Over the centuries  
 pits proliferated &amp; prospered mainly  
 due to the fact that the{coal seams   
{lay very close to the surface,}making 
 good quality hard coal easily         
 recoverable.Demand increased with the 
 coming of the industrial revolution,  
 although mechanisation was slow in    
 coming to{S.Derbyshire,}and it was the
 second quarter of the C.20th. before  
 modern mining methods were introduced.
 Coal mining has dominated both lives &amp;
 landscape in Swadlincote for well over
 a century,and gives employment to     
 thousands of local inhabitants.Some   
 people did not benefit from the mining
 being forced to evacuate their homes  
 due to subsidence.{Only 2 pits &amp; 2    
{open cast mines now remain.           </content>
