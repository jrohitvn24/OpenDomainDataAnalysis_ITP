		<content> The Police Training College trains    
 Policemen over a period of time.  They
 have a residential fourteen week      
 course.  The course includes learning 
 to swim and physical fitness.  The    
 policemen have an inspection to keep  
 them up to standard.  They have to    
 polish their toe caps until they can  
 see their faces in it.  In the main   
 building they have a museum.  They    
 have badges and police hats dating    
 from 1902.  They had gasmasks and     
 uniforms from the second world war.   
 The helicopter is flown by civilian   
 pilots and is used for security and   
 surveillance.  They have a close      
 circuit television centre for security
 and making safety films.  These films 
 are sent to the schools.  Local school
 children are used in the films along  
 with policemen from the college.
