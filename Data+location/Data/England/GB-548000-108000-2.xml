		<content>      There is a need to provide       
 entertainment in the area and the     
 countrymen have hunting shooting and  
 fishing. The local hunt meets         
 regularly throughout the Winter . Then
 there is the younger set, or pony     
 club. The Club organises lectures and 
 pony management classes culminating in
 the yealy Pony Club camp. This is a   
 great test of endurance for the       
 riders, their parents, camp officers  
 and last but not least, the ponies.   
      In the Summer the horse shows    
 take place. They cater for every      
 category of rider from toddlers being 
 escorted round the ring by Mums  to   
 full scale Showjumping. Also included 
 in the shows are driving ponies and   
 donkeys. Driving Horses and carts is  
 popular in the area because it is flat
 and the roads are quiet.              
     Dog shows are also very popular.  </content>
