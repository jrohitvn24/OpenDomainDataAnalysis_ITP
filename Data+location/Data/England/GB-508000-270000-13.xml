		<title>13GOVERNMENT IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>    The parliamentary constituency of  
 Huntingdon, to which the area belongs,
 is traditionally a safe Conservative  
 seat; but in parish council elections 
 personalities are more important than 
 party politics.                       
                                       
    Local government is in the control 
 of Cambridgeshire County Council and  
 Huntingdonshire District Council, but 
 local matters are handled by the five 
 parish councils of Catworth, Tilbrook,
 Spaldwick, Kimbolton and Stow Longa.  
                                       
    Amenities include a weekly refuse  
 collection, except at Little Catworth,
 and mains sewerage throughout the     
 area, apart from Stow Longa. Residents
 of Stow Longa enjoy the bonus of a    
 fortnightly visit from the mobile     
 library van.
