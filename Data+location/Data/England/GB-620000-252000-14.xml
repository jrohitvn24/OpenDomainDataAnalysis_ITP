		<title>14CLOPTONS SOCIAL LIFE</title>
		<content> Clopton has no social clubs for adults
 or children. Children wishing to join 
 cubs, scouts or brownies etc., must   
 travel to Grundisburgh. Likewise the  
 ladies wishing to join a club or      
 Womens Institute can join Grundisburgh
 W.I. or one of the villages' clubs.   
 For evening or adult education classes
 there are good schools at Kesgrave    
 Adult centre or Suffolk College of    
 F.H.E. There are no sports or         
 recreational facilities in the        
 village, however there is a Bowls Club
 at nearby Otley with its own Bowling  
 Green. Some children also have their  
 own horses stabled locally. Clopton   
 does have a public house called The   
 Clopton Crown.
