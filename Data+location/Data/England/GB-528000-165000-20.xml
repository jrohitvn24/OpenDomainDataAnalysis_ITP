		<title>20TRANSPORT IN WALLINGTON</title>
		<content>     In the Beddington area there is a 
large area of open ground around which 
are "A" and "B" roads forming the skel-
eton of the road transport of the area.
Branches off these roads lead to the   
built-up area. The Croydon Road, which 
passes through the south of Beddington,
is the main link between Croydon and   
Sutton. Between these two towns a bus  
service provides a link for shoppers,  
the buses being the 408 and 403. There 
are also other bus routes such as the  
127 between Hackbridge and Selsdon.    
     There was a proposal in about 1976
to continue the M23(to Brighton) to the
centre of London, which would have run 
through the old Queen Elizabeth's Woods
and then through the sewage farm, but  
the idea was abandoned.                
     There are three British Rail stat-
ions in the area which provide an imp- 
ortant commuter link with London.      </content>
