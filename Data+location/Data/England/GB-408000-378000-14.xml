		<content>  {The rock in our area is limestone   
 and can be seen in rocky outcrops,old 
 quarries and in the{dry stone walls   
 that are everywhere.                  
  Rivers often run underground and     
 there are{caves and potholes}nearby.  
  Limestone is the main{building stone 
 and is also quarried for the          
 production of cement,lime,roadstone   
 and chippings.                        
 Galena and fluorspar are often found  
 in limestone and there are remains    
 of{old lead mines}with sometimes      
 dangerous shafts exposed.             
 As limestone drains well, there are   
 few natural ponds and many farms      
 have concrete{dewponds}-some of these 
 have been filled in recently  which   
 has cut down the number of breeding   
 places for frogs and other amphibians.
