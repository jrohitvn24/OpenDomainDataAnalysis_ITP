		<title>13Jobs in Burtle</title>
		<content>  When I went around the village of    
 Burtle.I did a survey on what jobs    
 people did for a living.I asked 39    
 people and most of them were House    
 wives.                                
       The second most common are the  
 farmers.They all own a lot of arable  
 land and some had cows for milking.   
 There were about five or more people  
 who works for our  school.Some of the 
 older people were retired.A man who   
 works at  the village is called Mr    
 Richards.                             
 There are two Pubs in the village.    
 There is one member of the village    
 which is in the R.A.F and he is a man 
 who works on a aeroplane.There is some
 people who make there own ciders and  
 sell it.There is one man who is a     
 plasterer in {Street}.
