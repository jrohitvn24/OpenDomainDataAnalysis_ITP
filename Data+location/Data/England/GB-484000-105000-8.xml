		<title>08GOODWOOD AIRFIELD SITE.</title>
		<content>  The  site  of  what  is now {Goodwood
{Airfield and Motor Circuit }originally
 formed part of  Woodcote Farm  on the 
{Goodwood}Estate.At the outbreak of war
 in  1939  it was  requisitioned by the
 Air Ministry  for  use as a  satellite
 aerodrome  for {R.A.F. Tangmere.}     
 It was known as{Westhampnett Airfield.
 Spitfires  &amp;  Typhoons were based here
 &amp; flown by wartime heroes like{Douglas
{Bader.} Following the war, plans  were
 made  to  use  the  2.4 mile  long    
 perimeter road  as  a  motor  racing  
 track. The first race was held in{1948
 and  racing  continued until it closed
 in{ 1966.}Famous  drivers  have  raced
 here, including{Stirling Moss}and{Mike
{Hawthorn.}In 1958 two aircraft landing
 strips  for  small  aircraft  were    
 prepared in the centre of the circuit.
 This was the beginning of the airfield
 development  which  continues  today. </content>
