		<title>08BLUEGATES DAIRY SITE</title>
		<content>  Blugates Dairy farm was built on the 
 site of an orchard. Farms used to keep
 all kinds of animals and grow all     
 kinds of crops. They needed to feed   
 all the workmen and their families.   
 What was left was sold to the village.
 Farmers don't usually do this now they
 grow fewer crops. The villagers go to 
 shops to buy food, they tend to go    
 further and further to larger shops. A
 general store in the village has      
 just closed down.There are fewer      
 farmworkers others live in the        
 cottages. Some however are not in a   
 convenient place for commuters, like  
 the one next to the mud and smell of  
 the new dairy buildings.These are just
 left to fall down. Others are much    
 modified and become very desirable    
 residences. Some older farm buildings 
 are not kept in good repair but       
 are used temporarilly for storeage.   </content>
