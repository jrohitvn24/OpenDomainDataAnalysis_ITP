		<title>01GAZETTEER OF SALTBURN AREA</title>
		<content> Saltburn, Skelton and Marske are small
 towns in the Borough of Langbaurgh on 
 the North East Coast in Cleveland     
 County. The communities are surrounded
 by open fields, woods and farmlands   
 but are closely situated to large     
 industrial works on Teeside where many
 people find employment. Each town has 
 developed from small villages over the
 last 120 years. Saltburn,the only town
 that lies wholly within the grid, has 
 a population of over 6000. This semi- 
 rural locality has added attractions  
 including cliffs, beaches and wooded  
 valleys. Within 8 miles are the North 
 Yorks Moors. Residential housing      
 estates have been built to house those
 working at ICI and British Steel. With
 the decline in industry in recent     
 years unemployment has risen sharply. 
 Each community has retained its own   
 characteristics and independence.     </content>
