		<title>18THE RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content> At the end of Feverills Road in Little
 Clacton,there is a little riding      
 school.Every Saturday and sometimes on
 a week day I go down there for        
 lessons.Its really good fun because we
 don't just ride but we help out there 
 too.We do things like grooming,tacking
 up,sweeping the yard and in the summer
 I do mucking out.In the yard where we 
 ride,they have laid a new surface made
 out of ash.                           
 We use four ponies whose names are    
 Crystal,Snowy,Twilight and Peanuts.   
 Twilight is our favourite because she 
 is easy to ride and has got a comfy   
 saddle.At the moment we are praticing 
 at cantering and jumping in a large   
 field,and the owner puts them up 2 or 
 3 holes from the ground. Crystal can  
 jump the highest.                     
 One day I hope to work in, or own a   
 stable of my own.                     </content>
