		<content>My mum likes to be alone and to read a 
book or sometimes she likes to do a bit
of weeding.She most likes to watch     
T.V.when my brother and I arenÂ£t       
around.My dad likes to listen to       
classical records or he reads a book.  
Also sometimes he likes to do a bit    
of gardening or he likes to do some of 
his work for the colliery.He mostly    
likes to have a game of golf at        
Lakeside Country Club.My brother likes 
to draw things or occasionally he has a
swim in our swimming pool in the       
Summer.I like  to play with my Space   
Lego and I often  have a swim in the   
Summer.I also like to pretend making   
army guns and bombs,and my brother and 
I play on our computer.
