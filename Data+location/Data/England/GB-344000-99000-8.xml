		<title>08EVENTS IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> Events take place annually, any       
 profits usually going to local        
 charities.  Most popular are Street   
 Fairs, Flower Shows and the weekend   
 when private gardens are opened for   
 public viewing.  Flower Festivals are 
 held in the churches which are        
 beautifully decorated, often by flower
 arrangers, some of whom come from a   
 distance.  Craft displays are         
 sometimes included when demonstrations
 of spinning, weaving, wood turning,   
 potting, thatching can be seen        
 together with pictures displayed by   
 artists from the area.  On Shrove     
 Tuesday a pancake race is held at     
 Netherbury.  Pancakes must be tossed  
 several times along a course of some  
 100 yds. they are not eaten!  Harvest 
 Suppers are held in all villages, the 
 produce being autioned or distributed 
 to the sick and elderly.              </content>
