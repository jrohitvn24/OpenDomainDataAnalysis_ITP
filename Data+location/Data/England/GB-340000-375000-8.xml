		<title>08The Manchester Ship Canal</title>
		<content> In recent years the volume of traffic 
 on the Manchester Ship Canal has been 
 in decline. This is largely due to the
 closure of docks to the east of       
 Stanlow, and in particular the closure
 of Salford docks.                     
 However, sea going vessels still use  
 the Cawoods container dock,which has a
 regular trade with Eastern Europe. The
 Ship Canal is also used by smaller oil
 tankers making their way to and from  
 Stanlow Oil Refinery. The number of   
 vessels continuing this trade has     
 fallen dramatically in the last 20    
 years as greater use is now made of   
 pipelins to deeper offshore anchorage 
 points.
