		<title>08The Mitre</title>
		<content>      The Mitre is over 400 years old  
 but several extensions and alterations
 have been made over the 11 years Mr   
 Ibbottson has been there. Originally  
 there was a cottage on the far left of
 the pub, in which people were living  
 until the 1940's. This part is now    
 part of the saloon bar.               
      The fireplace has been knocked   
 out and several items of interest were
 found behind it. Clay pipes, newspaper
 cuttings and an old envelope which had
 two postmarks on it:-Stevenage-3rd    
 July and Witham-4th July. 50 miles in 
 a day! An extension to the kitchen has
 been made, apart from that the        
 majority of the timbers are original. 
      Major tasks, like laying tarmac  
 and painting the outside, are done by 
 the brewery, while decorating the     
 inside is done by Mr Ibbottson. He    
 employs sixteen people.               </content>
