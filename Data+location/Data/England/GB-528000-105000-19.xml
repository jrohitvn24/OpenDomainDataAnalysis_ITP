		<title>19St. Bartholemews</title>
		<content> St Bartholemews Church is situated to 
 the west of the London Road, shopping 
 centre. It was opened on September    
 8th, 1874 and is so large that it     
 dominates the skyline. People say that
 it was built to the dimensions of     
 Noah's Ark, which it looks like if you
 imagine it upside down. The stained   
 glass windows are fascinating. They   
 are set very high in the side walls   
 and each tell a different story. the  
 great circular window is also very    
 beautiful. Above the main door is a   
 small figure of St Bartholemew. In his
 hand he holds a model of the church.
