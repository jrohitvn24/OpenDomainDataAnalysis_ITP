		<title>05FARMING NEAR PETERSFIELD</title>
		<content> Most of the farms near Petersfield are
 about 60 acres in size. This is quite 
 small, as we found in a news item in  
 the TIMES newspaper recently that the 
 average size for farms in Britain is  
 63 hectares.(2 1/2 acres = 1 hectare).
                                       
 All the farmers grow some grass on    
 their land, and for most of them it is
 their main crop.  The grass is cut for
 hay or silage and fed to the animals. 
 The most important animals in the area
 are cattle. Several of the farms      
 produce beef. They sell their animals 
 at the markets in Winchester or       
 Guildford. One farmer takes his       
 animals to Chichester market. The     
 cattle market at Petersfield stopped  
 during the 1960s. Dairy farming is    
 done on a few farms, and pigs and     
 chickens are also raised.
