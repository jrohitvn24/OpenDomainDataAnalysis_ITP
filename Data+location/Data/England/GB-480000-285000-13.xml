		<content>  This wood has deciduous trees. They  
are mainly  Ash, Hazel, Oak, Hawthorn  
and Elderberry. On the Eastern side    
of the wood is a Medieval bank. There  
are four main paths through the wood   
which are called rides. The rides      
divide the wood into quarters. There   
are 9 quarters in the wood. Rockingham 
Estates own the wood but it is looked  
after by Mr and Mrs. Champion of Park  
Farm. They also look after Walter Wood.
Throughout the woods there are feeding 
shelters for pheasants and there is a  
wire enclosure for breeding them. When 
they are older the pheasants are       
released into the woods. Open spaces   
are cut to allow the birds to sun      
themselves. The Hazel trees are        
coppiced by the master thatchers of    
Rutland. The Hazel spars are used in   
thatched roofs of Northamptonshire,    
Leicestershire and Rutland.            </content>
