		<title>14Smarden W. - Marley Farm</title>
		<content> Marley Farm is a classic example of   
 change of use. Marley Farm house dates
 back to 1558 and doubtless the land   
 has been farmed since before that date
 but now the land is leased out and the
 house flanked by light industrial     
 units. In 1955 it was a cider factory 
 but by 1962 it had changed to a large 
 peanut packaging plant; this was a    
 flourishing business until 1968 when  
 the owner retired, business plummeted 
 and various buildings were leased to  
 other firms. There are now 7 separate 
 concerns. A food processing and       
 packaging plant, the largest, employs 
 about 50 people; a frozen food store  
 and warehouse 20; a cardboard carton  
 manufacturer 16 and a plastic coatings
 firm 9. In smaller units a double     
 glazing enterprise employs 6 and a    
 joinery doing loft conversions 4.
