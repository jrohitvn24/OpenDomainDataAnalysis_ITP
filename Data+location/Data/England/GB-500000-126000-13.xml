 kestrels which are birds of prey,     
 snipe,lesser spotted woodpeckers,and  
 green woodpeckers,hares,and rabbits.  
 Mink are pests,and eat fish and       
 poultry. Otterhounds now hunt them as 
 there are no longer any otters left in
 the area.Nightingales have been seen  
 as well as stoats and weasels.Some    
 people in this area enjoy fox-hunting.
 Hunting is for conservation, as foxes 
 need woodland and hedges for cover,   
 and hedges hold mice, voles and       
 rabbits which foxes eat.
