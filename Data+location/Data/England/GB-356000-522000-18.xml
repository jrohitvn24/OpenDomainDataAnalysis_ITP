		<content>    Watching television, live or with  
 video recordings,is the main form of  
 entertainment in the area, and most   
 people's set seem to be on permanently
 from teatime until bedtime. BBC and   
 Border are the two most popular       
 channels.                             
    The cinema in Penrith is used      
 rarely and only when a major or well  
 publicized film is shown and very few 
 people travel to other centres to see 
 films.                                
   'Going for a drink' with perhaps a  
 bar meal is a popular evening out     
 withlocal inns competing for trade.   
 The Crown and Kings Arms at Morland   
 and the Golden Pheasant at Cliburn    
 have a small group of regulars who    
 play darts,pool and dominoes.         
    The village hall,church and school 
 provide a small but well supported    
 programme of activities for all ages. </content>
