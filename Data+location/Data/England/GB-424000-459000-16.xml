		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF VANESSA</title>
		<content> I get up at seven-thirty am., get     
 washed at seven forty am., get dressed
 then go downstairs. I have my         
 breakfast of cereal and toast then I  
 get in the car and come to school.    
 School starts at nine am. When we get 
 to school we have an assembly then we 
 do English. at playtime I play with   
 Becky and Helen. After play we do     
 maths. We have lunch at twelve noon   
 the we play out again. After play we  
 finish off things we have not yet     
 finished. Usually we do activities in 
 the afternoon. After the third play we
 have story or play games outside. In  
 the summer we go in the swimming pool.
 Before we go home at three-thirty we  
 say a prayer. When I get home I get my
 homework done then I go outside to    
 play. At eight- thirty I go to bed.
