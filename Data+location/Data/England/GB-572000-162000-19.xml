		<title>19OPINIONS ABOUT WALDERSLADE</title>
		<content>{2.HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAVE LIVED HERE?  
      Less than a year.......... 8     
      More than a year but             
         less than 5 years...... 7     
      Between  5-10 years.......16     
      Between 10-20 years.......17     
      More than  20 years.......13     
 We decided people seemed to stay in   
 the area once they came here as 46    
 out of 61 had lived here 5-20+years.  
 As most of the houses are less than   
 30yrs old they couldn'live here much  
 longer so it looks as if they like it.
 To make sure we asked:                
{3.DO YOU LIKE LIVING IN WALDERSLADE? }
      Very much.................18     
      Quite a lot...............12     
      It's o.k. ................14     
      Not very much.............09     
      Not at all................08     
 We're right,they(44 out of 61) and 16 
 from other places like Walderslade.   </content>
