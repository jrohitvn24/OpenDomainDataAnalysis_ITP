		<title>07  Dairy Farm, near Wootton.</title>
		<content>   The farm, which is rented from the  
local authority, is in two parts for   
administrative reasons and is run by   
two parts of the same family. It       
mainly concentrates on milk production 
on its 150 acres but there is also a   
riding school with horses kept in      
stables on the farm.                   
   In the modern milking parlour about 
70 cows are milked twice a day in one  
and a half hours by two men. There is a
computerised system for giving         
individual amounts of food to the cows 
as they are being milked. Milk from    
from both parts of the farm is stored  
separately in two cooled tanks and is  
collected every morning by tanker.     
   The equipment includes five         
tractors, a combine harvester,         
a Landrover, ploughs,  trailers  and   
a forage harvester.
