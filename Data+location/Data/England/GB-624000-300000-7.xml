		<content> Basically a 3 tier system where       
 Poringland Parish council operates    
 under S.Norfolk District Council,     
 which is operates under NCC.Parish    
 council is non-political,dealing      
 mainly with small scale planning,     
 footpaths and open spaces and social  
 events.Its 11 members are elected     
 every 4 years and meets monthly in the
 village hall.                         
 POLITICS: Most of Poringland voted    
 Tory in the last general election.It  
 is generally felt the goverment spends
 too much on defence,but local Tories  
 seem otherwise satisfied with both the
 NCC and the parish council, but many  
 have little interest or involvement   
 with the latter.                      
 SOCIAL: Poringland offers a wide      
 selection of shops, amenities,        
 organisations which attract and keep  
 residents content.                    </content>
