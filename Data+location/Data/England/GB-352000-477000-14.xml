 ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO THERE WAS A MURDER 
 IN HOLME DOWN A LANE.TWO PEOPLE HAD   
 STABBED A MAN TO DEATH AND WRAPPED HIM
 IN A SLEEPING BAG. THEY STOPPED ON THE
 MOTORWAY AND DUMPED HIM,THEN DROVE    
 OFF.                                  
 THAT NIGHT OUR SECRETARY'S HUSBAND WAS
 WALKING HIS DOG DOWN THE LANE AND HE  
 SAW THE BODY AND PHONED THE POLICE.   
 THE NEXT DAY THERE WERE POLICE CARS   
 AND T.V CAMERAS ALL OVER.THAT NIGHT   
 THEY SHOWED IT ON THE NEWS.EVENTUALLY 
 THEY FOUND OUT WHO IT WAS.IT WAS A MAN
 AND A WOMAN FROM MANCHESTER WHO WERE  
 TRYING TO MAKE AN INSURANCE FIRM THINK
 THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO LOOKED LIKE THE 
 WOMAN'S HUSBAND HAD DIED, SO THAT THEY
 COULD CLAIM A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS.
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
