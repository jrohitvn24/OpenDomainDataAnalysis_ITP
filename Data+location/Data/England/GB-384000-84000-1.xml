		<title>01The Village,Wool</title>
		<content> Wool has everything a village needs;a 
 little stream,pleasant streets with   
 thatched cottages,modern amenities and
 friendly people who enjoy living in   
 the countryside,yet who can take the  
 train to London for a day out if they 
 choose.                               
 Ducks roam the High Street,sometimes  
 holding up the traffic.The stream,    
 rising from a spring at the watercress
 beds,flows quietly on to Wareham and  
 Poole Harbour.                        
 Over the past few years housing       
 estates have been built and the       
 population has grown.                 
 A new doctors' surgery has been built 
 and a village hall.                   
 Wool Church of England School is      
 taking part in the Domesday Project.We
 hope that in 900 years time Wool will 
 still be a nice place in which to     
 live.                                 </content>
