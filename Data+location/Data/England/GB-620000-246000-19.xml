		<content> The villages are served by post office
 stores, one in Plyford, one in Great  
 Bealings (slide).  These shops sstock 
 a range of products covering general  
 household needs but choice is limited.
  They are a lifeline to the non-car   
 owner but prices are higher than in   
 towns.  Slogan about such stores is   
 'Use it or lose it'.  The majority of 
 shopping is done in Ipswich or        
 Woodbridge or further afield, one     
 reason for the high car ownership in  
 the area.  A mobile shop with         
 groceries and bread visits the        
 villages regularly, also a fish-seller
 from Lowes estoft parks at certain    
 places and set times once a week.     
 Ipswich co-operative Society's        
 butchery van tours the area once a    
 week, a boon to the housebound.  The  
 milkman calls most days and sells a   
 small range of groceries.             </content>
