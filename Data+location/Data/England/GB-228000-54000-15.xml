		<content> There is little provision or storage  
 of water in the block.All mains water 
 comes by diverse routes from the      
 headwaters of the river Fowey near    
 Sibleyback.Formerly wells,springs and 
 small reservoirs were common;now only 
 retained on isolated farms.Normally   
 water supplies are good but pressure  
 can drop at summer peak when demand   
 doubles.                              
 Where possible sewage is put untreated
 into the sea.There are two outfalls   
 neither of which has a macerator.     
 Despite this,conventional wisdom      
 suggests that no health risk          
 ensues.Farms and Hamlets and isolated 
 houses need and have septic           
 tanks.These are emptied frequently    
 into a mobile bowser.For sometime the 
 inadequate sewage system has caused a 
 restraint/embargo on some development
