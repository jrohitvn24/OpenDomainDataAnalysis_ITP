		<content> In and around Hazelton there are      
 little country lanes where lots of    
 wild flowers grow.  The commonest     
 one we saw was Cow Parsley.   The     
 least common was Red Campion.   The   
 rudest flower was called Bloody       
 Cranesbill. A dandelion has a nice    
 yellow flower with nice green leaves. 
 When it dies it turns into a dandelion
 clock you can blow.   The seeds float 
 down and grow into dandelions again.  
 The smallest flower was the speedwell.
 In amongst the long grass we found    
 some vetch plants climbing up to the  
 sunlight.  We think wild flowers are  
 very pretty and should not be covered 
 by chemicals.   The farmers should not
 spray the fields by helicopter        
 because the wind can blow the chemical
 droplets onto our wild flowers.
