		<content> These are popular games for children  
 in the 1980's. "Forty,Forty," is a    
 game for many people. One person is,  
 "On," whilst the others go and hide.  
 The person who is, "On," counts to 100
 and when he's finished, he goes       
 to,look for them. If he finds them, he
 runs back to his base and says        
 ,"Forty,Forty,see you." If someone    
 gets home, they say,                  
 "Forty,Forty,home."                   
   In the Circle game, you get into a  
 circle and one person touches someone 
 on the back. They have to come after  
 you. You run around twice to get,     
 "Home."
