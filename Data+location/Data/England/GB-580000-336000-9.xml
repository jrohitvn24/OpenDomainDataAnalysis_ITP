		<content> Being relatively close to a coast     
 renowned for its wildlife, sailing and
 attractive beaches, the area has      
 recently seen the growth of           
 tourist-based activities.  The most   
 obvious has been the opening of three 
 privately owned sites for touring     
 caravans.  There are also about twelve
 holiday cottages, some used by their  
 owners, some let to visitors.  This is
 not a wholly good thing for it means  
 empty houses in wintertime which can  
 lead to depopulation.  In the season  
 pleasure is given to tourists by the  
 tranquil scene around the pond and the
 feeding of the many ducks there.      
 Visiting artists too make a pleasant  
 summer sight.  Prominent here is the  
 Village Sign on its plinth of         
 flintstones, depicting the shadowy    
 founder of the village.
