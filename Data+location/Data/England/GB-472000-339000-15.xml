		<content> The Aslockton , Whatton and           
 Scarrington area is not a poor area   
 but it is not a rich area. Most people
 work at jobs like teaching or office  
 work.  Alot of people work at the     
 detention centre as teachers or as    
 prison officers.  Many people work in 
 Nottingham and they travel every day  
 on the train to work.  They are called
 commuters. Other people work in and   
 around the villages at different      
 things.  Some work on the farms, some 
 work in the village shops. Many people
 have their own businesses like        
 plumbing or electricians. When the    
 teenagers leave the nearby            
 coprehensive school very few of them  
 find jobs near home. They either get  
 jobs in Nottingham, Newark or Grantham
 some get jobs in Bingham, which is    
 only afew miles away.
