   Somerby School is very old. It was  
built in 1878. It is a Victorian       
building.                              
   It used to have toilets in the      
playground but a few years ago they    
had a modern block joined onto the     
school,also on the south east wall     
there used to be a window which had to 
bricked up when the new toilets where  
built.                                 
   The school is heated by an          
oil fired boiler.                      
   The school has an old piano and we  
have a visiting music teacher one      
afternoon a week, we also have an art  
teacher on every wednesday afternoon.  
   The school is group 1 and has two   
teachers a teaching head who has the   
junior class and an infant teacher.
