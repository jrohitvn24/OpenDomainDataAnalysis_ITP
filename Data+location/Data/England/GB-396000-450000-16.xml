		<content>  Aireville Swimming Baths is situated 
 in Aireville Park, Skipton. It was    
 opened by{Anita Longbough M.B.E.}on   
 the{14th May 1964.}It costs 30 pence  
 for an unlimited amount of time.      
      Just off the entrance foyer there
 is a cafe which over looks a shallow  
 learner's pool. There are two changing
 rooms next to each other. One for     
 ladies, and one for Men. In the       
 changing rooms you collect a basket to
 put your clothes in then find a       
 cubicle to chang in. When you hand    
 your clothes in an attendant takes    
 them and gives you a band to put on   
 your arm or leg to identify your      
 basket. The pool is{1.0 metres}deep at
 the litte end and{3.5 metres}at the   
 deep end. There is a{diving bord}and a
{spring bord.}
