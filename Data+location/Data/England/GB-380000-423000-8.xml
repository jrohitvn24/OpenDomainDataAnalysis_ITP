		<title>08SKI ROSSENDALE</title>
		<content> First ideas for a ski complex were    
 brought before Rawtenstall Borough    
 Council in 1969. Ski Rossendale was   
 opened in Autumn 1973 at a cost of    
 Â£60,000, Â£7,500 of which came from the
 Sports Council.                       
 In October 1979, an idea for a        
 Regional Ski Centre at Ski Rossendale 
 was suggested to the Rossendale       
 Borough Council. Improvements would   
 include extending the main ski slope  
 to 210m, a new ski tow, extra         
 floodlighting and the conversion and  
 extension of a barn to provide        
 accomodation and 'apres ski'          
 activities.                           
 The present ski slope is about 150m   
 long and 11m wide. Vertical drop is   
 35m. There are two nursery slopes     
 about 20m by 12m. The matting is      
 Dendix Snowslope and the tow is a     
 button drag lift.                     </content>
