     I get up around 6 o'clock every   
morning, rain or shine.  Before        
breakfast I fetch the cows from the    
field on the hill.  When my son has    
milked them, I bottle the milk - we    
have green tops to denote unpateurised 
milk.  After having my breakfast, I    
deliver our milk to houses around      
Ecton and Warslow.                     
     When I return from my milk round, 
around 12 o'clock, I prepare and eat   
my dinner and feed the cats, hens etc. 
     During the afternoon I do my      
housework, until about half past five  
when I have my tea.                    
     After tea I wash and sterilise    
the milk bottles ready for the next    
day.  I then can relax watching        
television.  I go to bed at about      
half past ten, after a busy day.
