 LOCAL HISTORY                         
 65 years ago the children at Bentworth
 school started at 9:00 am,they went   
 home at 12:00 pm for lunch &amp; came back
 at 1:00 pm.They went home at 3:45 pm, 
 there was a bell in the roof that rang
 at these times.The boys playground was
 separate from the girls playground.Our
 School field in Mrs Knight,s time was 
 owned by Mr Talbot &amp; the children were
 not allowed on it.They washed from a  
 bucket just containing water.They went
 to the loo in a bucket with a wooden  
 seat over it.Mrs Knight always went   
 home because she lived over the road  
 where Mrs Gilmor lives now.They had no
 sports at school but they had a Sunday
 School sports day.They joined in with 
 the harvest in school time bringing in
 the corn.
