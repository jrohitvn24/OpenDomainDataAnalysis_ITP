		<title>20Truro - Cornwall's Centre 2</title>
		<content> Cornwall's major private schools are  
 in Truro, Truro School and the High   
 School for Girls, these take boarders 
 from all over the world. In recent    
 years the shopping centre has been    
 transformed by rebuilding and the     
 arrival of some major chain stores as 
 well as many smaller shops. Car       
 parking unfortunately has not kept    
 pace with the development, and there  
 are often queues at peak periods, but 
 there is a Park and Ride scheme. The  
 Community Health Council has recently 
 moved to St Austell, because of the   
 parking problem. The Wednesday Cattle 
 Market attracts many people, it has   
 just moved to a new site outside the  
 town, after outgrowing its old site on
 Castle Hill. A new BBC Local Radio    
 station, Radio Cornwall, is based in  
 the City, because of Truro's new and  
 increasing importance in the County.  </content>
