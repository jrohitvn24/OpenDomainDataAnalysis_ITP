		<content> SOME OF THE MAIN BREEDS IN OUR AREA   
 ARE POL DORSETS, HORN DORSETS, MULES, 
 TEXTEL AND MASHAMS. THE EWES BREED FOR
 ABOUT 6 YEARS AND ARE SLAUGHTERED AT  
 7. THE FARMERS HOPE FOR 2 LAMBS PER   
 EWE PER YEAR BUT THE AVERAGE IS 1.6.  
 MOST LAMBING IS IN APRIL ALTHOUGH ON A
 FEW FARMS IT TAKES PLACE IN NOVEMBER. 
 NOVEMBER LAMBING MEANS THE LAMBS HAVE 
 TO BE KEPT INDOORS IN WINTER. A BIG   
 PROBLEM IN WINTER IS THE FREEZING OF  
 STREAM WATER AND THE FARMER HAS TO    
 CARRY BUCKETS OF WATER TO THE SHEEP   
 HIMSELF. OTHER PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE   
 DISEASE ORF WHICH CAUSES SCABS AROUND 
 AND IN THE MOUTH, WHICH MAKES FEEDING 
 DIFFICULT. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF A FARM 
 IS 58 HECTARES AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER 
 OF SHEEP IS 150. LAMBS ARE SLAUGHTERED
 3 TO 4 MONTHS AFTER BIRTH. AT PRESENT 
 SHEEP FARMING IS MORE PROFITABLE THAN 
 ANY OTHER TYPE OF STOCK FARMING.      </content>
