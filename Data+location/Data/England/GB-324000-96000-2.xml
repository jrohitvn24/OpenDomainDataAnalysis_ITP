		<content> The breed of cow is a Friesian,       
 but they cost more.   An average      
 price would be Â£500 each for a        
 Friesian.   While milking the cow,    
 it has cake.   In the summer the      
 cow eats grass.   In the winter the   
 cow eats silage.   The best age to buy
 a cow is when it has only had one     
 calf.   A  cow lives up to 11 or 12.  
 The cow is 8years when it has all its 
 teeth.   It only has 8 teeth.         
 We store the oats, barley and wheat in
 big bins.   When we want it, we auger 
 it out of the bin and crush it up.    
 The cattle like silage, fodder beet   
 and maize indoors.   In a pit         
 put 100 loads of silage or  maize.    
 The calfs you can get in this area are
 hereford,jersey,friesian,belgian blues
 some people have them,limousins,and   
 charolais. One farmer sells his milk, 
 all the other farmers a milkman comes.</content>
