		<content> Flat dwelling area, mainly highrise   
 buildings of 20 storeys or so. Some   
 building development of smaller       
 houses. Have cleared dockyard area    
 close to school and built a small     
 estate of some houses and maisonettes 
 and 3 storey flats. Large barracks    
 being cleared off Francis Street -    
 houses being built. The aim seems to  
 be to get families into houses rather 
 than high rises. Now developed an     
 aquatic centre by the old dockyard.   
 A recreation centre has a youth club, 
 community centre, nursery playgroup   
 for young children. The facilities are
 open to the general public and not    
 just those from the dockyard area. The
 old clock house, an attractive        
 building, has been retained and is now
 used as a community centre.           
 A lot of effort is being made to      
 improve quality of life in the area.  </content>
