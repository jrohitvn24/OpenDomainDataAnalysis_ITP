		<title>05Aythorpe Roding Mill</title>
		<content> The mill was built in 1760,then the   
 brick bottom was not there. The whole 
 windmill was held up by a massive     
 pole. The windmill is the oldest one  
 of its kind. Now the bottom is round, 
 made of brick and is called a Round   
 House. Something called the "Boss"    
 holds the sails together in the       
 middle. There is a lightning conductor
 on the end of all the sails. A spider 
 cuffing opens and closes the shutters 
 on the sails which are 64 feet long.  
 The round house is only for protection
  to the quarter bars, cross bars and  
 of course the main bar. There is a    
 massive brake which stops the sails.  
 The flour drops onto a kind of        
 propellor and is sorted into best     
 flour, second best flour and bran,    
 where once again it drops down, this  
 time to different bins and is         
 shovelled into sacks and sold.        </content>
