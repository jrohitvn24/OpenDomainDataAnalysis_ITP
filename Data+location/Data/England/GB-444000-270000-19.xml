		<title>19THURLASTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>The church was built in 1849. It was a 
school until 1919 when it was licensed 
for public worship.A church before this
called St.Edmunds was licensed in      
1360 A.D. It is a chapel of ease and   
part of the parish church of           
Dunchurch. It holds 120 people. The    
average is 20 people for communion and 
30 on Sundays. For special events it   
has more. There is no graveyard.       
Babies are baptised in the church.     
Marriages are by special arrangement.  
There is a village fete in Church Lane 
and a ladies club which meets once a   
week. One lady in particular,          
regularly attends church and helps in  
many ways. We were shown sixties       
photographs when the fete was being    
held near the church.
