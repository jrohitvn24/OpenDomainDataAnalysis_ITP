		<title>10TARDIS POTTERY,HOOKWAY.</title>
		<content>   Mrs Rives-Roberts is the owner of   
 Tardis Pottery in Hookway{(housed in a
{garden shed}hidden away in this       
 hamlet.)She uses plaster of paris     
 moulds to produce some of her pieces  
 and{fettling tools}and other things to
 make impressions in the clay.If she   
 were using a wheel she would need     
 different tools.To make impressions   
 in the pots she uses clone tools.     
{ The potter gets her casting clay from
{America because she can't find any in 
{England of the quality she wants.}    
   When decorating an article she can  
 either use glazes or stains.          
   She sells most of her pottery to    
 three main shops,but shows her work   
 at craft exhibitions and the library. 
  Most potters have a style of their   
 own and so does Mrs Rives-Roberts.She 
{concentrates on mugs,jugs and  small  
{animals.                              </content>
