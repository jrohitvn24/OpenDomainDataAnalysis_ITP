		<content> Our grandparents remember that there  
 used to be 2 railway stations in the  
 town. There was a Thursday cattle     
 market which sold cows and chickens.  
 There were 2 schools (the Queen's Road
 School - now the Juniors - and a      
 Methodist school), 4 harness makers'  
 shops, 2 stone masons, 3 blacksmiths, 
 2 hotels and a horse drawn cab that   
 met the trains and took the visitors  
 to the hotels. There was a flour mill 
 in Bridge Street. Most people were    
 employed at the printing works or on  
 the land. The Police Station used to  
 be in Gladstone Road. The street lamps
 ran on gas. The Public Library used to
 be in a special building in the       
 grounds of the Queen's Road school.   
 The building was later used as a      
 classroom and then knocked down. There
 was a big horse trough in the market  
 square. There were 2 Picture Houses.  </content>
