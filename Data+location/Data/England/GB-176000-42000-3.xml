		<title>03Growth of Threemilestone.</title>
		<content>{Threemilestone}started off as fields, 
 then some houses were built. A small  
 school was built which had only two   
 classrooms and was called{Chyvealah.} 
 As the village grew the school was too
 small so it was knocked down and{     
{Threemilestone C.P School}was built.  
 Threemilestone School has just ten    
 class rooms and a{Library}and a{      
{Resources room.}With the money from   
 the fete we are going to build two    
 small{Adventure Playgrounds.}Wimpy has
 just built about 200 houses and they  
 are planning to build 500 more. That  
 will mean that the school will be too 
 small. Threemilestone has just built a
 new shop by the{Mini Market}but we do 
 not know what it is going to be used  
 for.
