		<title>10American Forces Families(2)</title>
		<content> When we asked what they found hard to 
 get used to they mentioned driving on 
 the left, the light mornings (due to  
 British summer-time) and small fridges
 and freezers!                         
                                       
 To live in the{R.A.F. Married Quarters
 they have to pay about{Â£300 a month.  
 However, they are very pleased with   
 the house and think it is worth it.   
                                       
 They will probably be in this country 
 for 4 years before going back to      
 America. This was one of the reasons  
 why they believed more Americans did  
 not send their children to British    
 schools. That is because of the       
 difference in spelling certain words, 
 the use of different scales of        
 measurement and so on would all have  
 to be re-learned on returning to the  
 U.S.A.                                </content>
