		<title>06The Beacon Hill Kiwi</title>
		<content> On the slope of Beacon Hill above     
 Bulford Camp a Kiwi is cut out of the 
 chalk. It stands 128 metres high by 36
 metres wide.A month before the        
 Armistice at the end of the 1st World 
 War, Major Metcalfe, a New Zealander, 
 asked the War Office if his men might 
 cut a Kiwi out of the chalk in the    
 style of the ancient Wiltshire white  
 horses.                               
  The Kiwi was drawn by Percy          
 Blenkcarne, a fellow New Zealander and
 one of the education staff, from a    
 picture in the British Museum. The New
 Zealand Canterbury Battalion and some 
 engineers laid out the design with    
 tape and cut away the gorse and turfs 
 to produce the Kiwi.                  
   During the 2nd World War the Kiwi   
 was covered with earth but it was     
 later restored and is now kept in good
 repair by 249 Signals Squadron.       </content>
