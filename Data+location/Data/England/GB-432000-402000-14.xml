		<title>14WORSBROUGH VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The oldest residential part of the    
 district of Worsbrough is{Worsbrough  
{Village}.It is competely separate from
 the rest of Worsbrough both           
 geographically and architecturally.It 
 stands at the top of a steep wooded   
 hillside.It was in saxon times        
 called{Wircesburg}and was a fortified 
 settlement.Since that time the        
 spelling has changed many times.For   
 many years the name was spelt         
 "{Worsborough}",and many older people 
 still refer to it as such.The name    
 was officially changed on 1st February
 1956 to the present spelling of       
{Worsbrough}.This was done at the      
 instigation of Mr.A.O.Elmhirst whose  
 reseach showed the word{Brough}to mean
 a fortified settlement which is what  
 Worsbrough originally was.
