		<title>10BOXTED PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> St.Peter's church Boxted was built in 
 the 12th century and was just a simple
 nave.A north and South aisle were     
 added in 14th century and the roof was
 raised.Two dormer type windows were   
 added to the south wall which give a  
 cottage style look to the outside of  
 the church.                           
   The present rector is Douglas       
 Lancashire M.A.,B.D., who lives at    
 Langham and serves both Langham and   
 Boxted Churches.There are usually two 
 services each Sunday but times vary to
 fit in with the Langham Church.Four   
 Holy Communion Services,two Evensong  
 ,one Morning Prayer and one Family    
 Service are held each month. There is 
 a good relationship with the Methodist
 Church and a joint service is held in 
 the Village Hall on the fourth Sunday 
 of each month.The church roof and the 
 heating need repairing.               </content>
