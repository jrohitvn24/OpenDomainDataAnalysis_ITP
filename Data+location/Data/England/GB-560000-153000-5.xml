		<title>05The village of PLAXTOL</title>
		<content> The village of Plaxtol has a{         
{population}of about 1200 people.  It  
 is situated on the western slopes of  
 the Bourne Valley, 5 km north of the  
 town of{Tonbridge}in Kent.            
                                       
 Half a dozen shops, a pub and a       
 restaurant form the centre of the     
 village.  Its houses have been build  
 along the lanes which criss-cross the 
 hillside.                             
                                       
 Plaxtol is in the middle of an area of
 mixed farming and many of the people  
 who lived here before World War 2     
 worked either on the land or in       
 service at one of several large houses
 to be found in the area.  In 1985,    
 most of Plaxtol's working{population} 
 are either employed in nearby towns   
 or commute daily to London.
