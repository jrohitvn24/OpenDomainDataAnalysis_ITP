		<title>12RECREATION - quarry walks</title>
		<content> A favourite walk from the town of     
 Hartlepool is to the disused quarry   
 which lies beside Brierton Farms. The 
 quarry is privately owned and has not 
 been used as a quarry for a number of 
 years. It should still be entered only
 with permission but sadly it has      
 become something of a tip. The father 
 of one pupil had visited the quarry   
 now and then for twenty three years   
 and told us two things he remembered  
 about it. First he recalled a time    
 when the quarry had quite deep pools  
 and was the home for newts , frogs,   
 tadpoles and toads. Now the quarry is 
 mostly dry. Second he remembered      
 seeing there a small inhabited        
 building which has now disappeared.   
 Today the quarry is used most by      
 budding trials riders on bikes.
