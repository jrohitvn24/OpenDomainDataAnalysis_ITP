		<content> Many people recall that Denholme,{    
{50 years ago}was a busy village with{ 
{Fosters mill}still employing many     
 people and regular{train}and{bus}     
 services. {Chapels,churches}and the{  
{Mechanics Institute}were flourishing. 
                                       
 A local historian, {Mrs. Clem Heap,}  
 whose family has lived in Denholme for
 over 200 years, celebrated her{90th   
{birthday}this year.  Interested in    
{local dialect}she recalls a phrase,   
 used in the Bronte novels, {"tha't a  
{nowt"}meaning wicked. Other language;{
{flayed ter dee-ath"}(frightened) and {
{"laiking"}(playing) are still in use  
 by older people today.  She supports  
 the work of the {Yorkshire Dialect    
{Society}and asserts that{dialect}like{
{Yorkshire pudding}has flavour and     
 quality.                              
                                       </content>
