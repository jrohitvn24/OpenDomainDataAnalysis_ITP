		<title>19Our day at Bodenham Primary</title>
		<content> We arrive at school between 8.50 and  
 9.10. Some come on the bus, some walk,
 some ride bicycles but most come in   
 our parents cars. School starts at    
 9.15. After registration we go into   
 assembly.Lessons begin at 9.30. We    
 have a wide variety of lessons in the 
 morning. Playtime is 11.00 to 11.15   
 and we all go out to the play ground. 
 The infants play at one end and we    
 play at the other. We play lots of    
 games especially football. Dinner time
 is 12.00 for the infants and 12.10 for
 the juniors. Mrs Clarke, a parent,    
 makes the dinners. They are really    
 good. A favourite is baked potatoes,  
 coleslaw, and quiche. We eat in family
 groups at tables of 8. After play at  
 1.15 we have lessons. These include   
 art, craft, needlework, games, topics,
 and music. We have guitar, recorders, 
 and choir clubs. The day ends at 3.30.</content>
