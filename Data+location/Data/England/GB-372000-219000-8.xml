		<title>08Still Working At Eighty-Two!</title>
		<content>     Emma Burlow's great great uncle   
 Frank was recently presented with a   
 silver bar and trophy at the Three    
 Counties Show by Princess Margaret    
 (sister of the Queen) for working     
{sixty years}with the House family who 
 are local farmers.                    
     It is remarkable that this man at 
 eighty-two years old,still works a    
 five day week and even overtime when  
 needed.He remembers the horses in the 
 old days and the changing over to     
 machinery on the farm.                
    Frank lived in Pauntley for twenty 
 three years but is now living in      
 Taynton.His house used to be the old  
 Post Office and two families shared   
 the house.In the wartime he kept some 
 pigs and some sheep which he sold.Now 
 he just has a cat and a goldfish.
