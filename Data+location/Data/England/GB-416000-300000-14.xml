		<title>14CHURCH:DRAYTON BASSETT</title>
		<content>The Parish Church of St. Peter's       
dominates Drayton Bassett village.     
Built of local sandstone in Gothic     
style with nave, chancel and 15th      
century tower.  A church was built here
in early 14th century by Sir Ralph     
Bassett, replacing an earlier building.
The Bassett family was associated with 
the village for 300 years until 1390.  
The origonal medieval church, decayed  
by 1793, was rebuilt by Robert Peel    
(1750-1830).  He and his son, Sir      
Robert Peel (1788-1850) Prime Minister 
are buried in the church.  The church  
was enlarged and improved in 1854.     
Stained glass windows and an organ were
added by another Peel benefactor       
(1875).  Outside is the old church     
school (now Post Office) and large     
church yard with yew trees still in    
use.  Services are held every Sunday.  
The congregation is small.             </content>
