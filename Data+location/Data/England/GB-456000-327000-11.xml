		<title>11BALDWIN'S BRICKWORKS BUNNY</title>
		<content> Bricks have been made in Bunny for    
 hundreds of years. In 1936 a{kiln}was 
 built in the brickyard by{H.J.Baldwin 
{Ltd.,}and since then they have made a 
 good number of bricks. The clay they  
 use is called{keuper marl}and it is   
 quarried from Bunny Hill. They mix the
 clay with water to make the substance 
 for bricks, and put it into moulds.   
 The bricks are taken out of the moulds
 and stacked in the kiln to dry for 9  
 days. Then they fire the bricks, the  
 oven has to be{980'C}and the bricks   
 stay in for 3 days. Then the kiln is  
 switched off and the bricks are left  
 for 6 days to cool. Baldwins also make
 cable covers in 5 different sizes and 
 concrete slabs.{Imperial}sizes are    
 made for home and export. The last lot
 of goods was cable covers which they  
 sold to the{SUDAN.}There are 3 workers
 in the quarry and 37 in the brickyard.</content>
