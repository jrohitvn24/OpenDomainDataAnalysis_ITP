		<content> In Ingst there is no church. The      
 nearest churches and chapels are in   
 Olveston, Tockington, Aust, Elberton  
 and Pilning. There is a dissused      
 church in Northwick the tower of which
 is very interesting. There have been  
 several churches on that spot. The    
 first of which was built in the 12th  
 century by the Normans.               
 There have been several churches on   
 that spot because the foundations sank
 and the churches fell to the ground.  
 The church which is standing now is St
 Thomas's church.                      
  Another building of interest is the  
 ESPERANZA  it is the oldest in Aust.  
 Some people say that some of the      
 timbers were from the boat{ESPERANZA  
  which sank  in the river Severn.     
 In Aust there is also a pub which is  
 over 200 years old.
