		<title>16AN ADULT'S DAY AT HOME</title>
		<content>   My name is John. I am 34 years old. 
 I get up in the morning at 7.00 am. I 
 have a wash, a shave and get dressed  
 and go downstairs at about 7.20 am. I 
 put on the kettle in the kitchen to   
 make a pot of tea and then I take the 
 dog out for her morning walk.         
   I return at about 7.45 am. and eat  
 breakfast, usually cereal, which my   
 wife has prepared. At 8.00 am. I leave
 home to drive to work.                
   I return home from work at about    
 5.00 pm. and wash and change in time  
 for dinner which is usually at about  
 6.00 pm. After dinner I usually read  
 the paper for an hour and then do any 
 work which is necessary. This might be
 gardening or work connected with my   
 job. Later in the evening I might go  
 out with my wife to the local public  
 house or I might stay at home and     
 watch the television.                 </content>
