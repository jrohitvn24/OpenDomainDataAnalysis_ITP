		<title>01EYDON - A VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Eydon is built on an inusual box shape
 - with four roads or lanes enclosing a
 central block containing most of the  
 older properties. It is on a ridge    
 with a high water table and away from 
 main roads. Access can be difficult in
 Winter. Farmland surrounds the village
 and the main farmhouses are to be     
 found in the village itself with the  
 land stretching away behind them. Most
 people work in industry in the nearby 
 towns, there being very little        
 employment in Eydon itself, the farms 
 being worked by their owners. there is
 a good general shop, post office,     
 public house, church and chapel,      
 village hall, several visiting        
 butchers, bakers and a fishman. Also a
 good bus service to Banbury. Eydon is 
 rapidly becoming a dormitory as the   
 old people die the young people move  
 away, not being able to compete with  </content>
