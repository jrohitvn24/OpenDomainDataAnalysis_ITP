		<title>02LANDSCAPE Longton District</title>
		<content>{    }Longton Moss is the name and     
 nature of this district , which is    
 part of the WEST LANCASHIRE plain. The
 land is very wet, and is artificially 
 drained. It is good for potatoes,     
 carrots and roses with glasshouses to 
 grow lettuce and tomatoes, and some   
 grain is grown here now.{             
   The Western area is mainly pasture  
 and the East is arable. Much of the   
 land is used by horses; there are two 
 riding schools, one horse trainer and 
 one racing stable within the plot. {  
{   }The soil is basically{clay}and    
 until recently this was excavated to  
 make bricks. The derelict site became 
 a nature reserve with{tern}using the  
 flooded pits. This year the owners    
 decided to fill in some of the pits   
 and houses will be built on the site.
