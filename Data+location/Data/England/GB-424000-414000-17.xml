   Churches in this area are either    
 Anglican or Methodist. There is a     
 parish church at Flockton and         
 St.Luke's Parish church at Overton.   
 The Methodist Churches at Netherton,  
 Middlestown and Flockton are part of  
 the Horbury and Ossett Circuit, but   
 that at Midgely is a Barnsley Circuit.
 There was a Methodist Church at       
 Overton but this closed through lack  
 of support.                           
   St.Luke's Church used to be in      
 Middlestown but a new building was    
 erected at Overton. There have also   
 been extensive additions to the Sunday
 School at Netherton Trinity Methodist 
 Church, Over Â£20,000 being spent on   
 the extentions ( new classroom,       
 improvement of Kitchen and toilet     
 facilities and relaying the car park).
