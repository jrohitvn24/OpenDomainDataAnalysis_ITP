		<title>14A Typical Day in my Life</title>
		<content> 1         GROUP EFFORT.               
 Most mornings I get up between 7.30   
 and 8.00a.m. and after I help my mum  
 with the breakfast we all sit down to 
 eat and watch Breakfast T.V. until its
 time for me to go to school.          
 I start school at 9.00a.m. and we work
 till 12.00 with a quarter of an hour  
 break for play. I have a school dinner
 but some of my friends bring          
 sandwiches. We work for another two   
 hours in the afternoon and leave      
 school at 3.00p.m. Some of us go home 
 by bus or car while a few walk. After 
 I have done my homework I watch the   
 children's programmes on T.V. before  
 sitting down to an evening meal.      
 Before I go to bed I enjoy doing some 
 of my hobbies which include playing   
 the piano, going to cubs or using my  
 micro computer. I always take a book  
 to read before I go to sleep.         </content>
