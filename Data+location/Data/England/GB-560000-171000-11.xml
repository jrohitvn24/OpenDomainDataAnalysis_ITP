 come 2-3 times a week.They go on day  
 outings to places like Aylesford      
 Priory.The elderly people travel to   
 and from the centre by a minibus.There
 is also entertainment at the centre.  
 They have bingo,raffles,brass bands   
 and parties.They hold a clinic for    
 foot care,and they have a hair        
 salon.They have meals there too,hot   
 and cold,and they have a tuck shop,   
 which is a trolley which is taken     
 around the centre and on it can be    
 found sweets,tea,coffee and tinned
