		<title>14JOHN PAUL JONES.</title>
		<content> John Paul Jones,an American privateer,
 arrived on the east coast of          
 Northumberland during 1812. His       
 appearance here was a great surprise, 
 and he caught a sloop. He arrived on  
 the east coast a few days before the  
 Duke of Northumberland's Audit held at
 the castle. The whole payment of rents
 (mostly paid in gold) were brought    
 there. This would be a grand prize for
 the pirate, if he had known about it. 
 The Bailiff of the castle thought that
 Jones knew of the Audit, and had come 
 to take it, as he had already done at 
 Lord Selkirk's in Scotland, so the    
 Militia was called out. However Jones 
 decided to bombard Alnmouth instead   
 and hit Wooden Farm. Now in 1985, the 
 marks at the side of Wooden Farm left 
 by the cannon, can still be seen.
