		<title>15THE LOCAL LIBRARY</title>
		<content>   The local library in the village of 
 Jacksdale is a small building on the  
 main road which runs alongside the    
 village.                              
   A library is a place where books can
 be borrowed without charge. The       
 library has two sections: one         
 containing children's books and one   
 for adult books. Each member of the   
 library has a number of tickets (a    
 child has two). When the person has   
 selected the books he/she wishes to   
 borrow they are taken to the          
 librarian. The librarian removes a    
 ticket from inside the book and places
 it with the borrowers ticket. The     
 librarian then stamps a date inside   
 the book. This is the date by which   
 the book has to be returned. It is    
 usually 3 weeks. If the book is not   
 returned by the date shown the        
 borrower is fined a small amount.     </content>
