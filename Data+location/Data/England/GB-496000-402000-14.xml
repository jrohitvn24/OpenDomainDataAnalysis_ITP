		<title>14The Old Mill</title>
		<content> The mill is several hundred years old.
 The base is made of stone.The later   
 additions were made of brick to       
 support the sails.When it was working 
 two or three men were needed to run   
 it.This mill is unusual because it was
 both sail and wind powered,and later  
 by an engine.The bottom layer had many
 rooms that were last occupied in 1860.
 The present owner is Mr Reeson.Born in
 the village although his father and   
 grandfather were millers in Kirton nr.
 Boston.In 1912 the sails and water    
 wheel were removed and the engine     
 house was built.Now even this has gone
 .In 1965 the mill closed through lack 
  of trade ( farmers ground their own  
  meal). Today the mill is in a poor   
 condition.The stone is crumbling,the  
 wooden window frames and doors are    
 rotting.There are no plans to renovate
 although its the only one of its kind.</content>
