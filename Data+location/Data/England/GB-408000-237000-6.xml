		<title>06VILLAGE LIFE IN BROADWAY.</title>
		<content> If you drive along the main street of 
{Broadway}on a weekday evening it      
 appears to be a typical, quiet, sleepy
{Cotswold village.}You would not       
 imagine much happens, but come        
 daytime, especially at holiday time   
 and weekends it is as full of visitors
 as a seaside resort, but these        
 visitors are from all over the world. 
 Many premises cater for them including
 gift shops and businesses specialising
 in locally made food and crafts.      
 Residential premises abound, from 'Bed
 and Breakfast' to large hotels. Apart 
 from their busy daily routines the    
 residents of{Broadway}lead active     
 social lives.  There are a great many 
 clubs and societies ranging from Cubs,
 Brownies, Guides and a Youth Club for 
 teenagers to a thriving local Football
 Team, Young Farmers, Toc H, Women's   
 Institute and Darby and Joan.         </content>
