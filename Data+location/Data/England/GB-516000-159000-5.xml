 This area is well served by roads     
 having the main A24 from London and   
 Epsom to Leatherhead and then by way  
 of the Mole Gap (A valley cut by the  
 River Mole through the chalk of the   
 North Downs) to Dorking and beyond.   
 The A243 also crosses from North to   
 South carrying a great deal of traffic
 from Kingston (and also London) to    
 join up with the A24 at Leatherhead.  
                                       
 Smaller road cross from East to West  
 giving the area easy access to these  
 major roads and also the M25 motorway 
 that circles London.                  
                                       
 The common has several car parks so   
 that people can easily enjoy the wild 
 life and walks to be found there.
