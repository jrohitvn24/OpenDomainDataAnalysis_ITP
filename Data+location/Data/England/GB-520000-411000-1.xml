		<content> Stallingborough is a village situated 
 on heavy land some six miles north of 
 Grimsby and three miles south of      
 Immingham. The parish stretches       
 north-east to the Humber Bank, but the
 village itself is built along the one 
 road, with two main clusters of houses
 those in Church Lane and on a small   
 new estate - Leggott Way. It is now   
 mainly a dormitory village, with      
 most of the workers travelling out to 
 Immingham or Grimsby. The farmland    
 which is mostly to the east of our    
 area is worked by two farmers. The    
 village is served by two shops, and   
 hourly bus and train services are     
 available to Grimsby, the trains also 
 connecting with buses over the Humber 
 Bridge to Hull. There is a junior     
 school, a parish church, a Methodist  
 Chapel and a public house.
