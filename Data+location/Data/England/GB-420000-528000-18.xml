		<title>18LEGEND OF BISHOP AUCKLAND-1</title>
		<content> Once a fierce wild boar so terrorized 
 the land about Bishop Auckland that   
 the Bishop offered a huge reward for  
 its capture.                          
 No-one was brave enough except a young
 man named Pollard who decided to try  
 his luck. He decided that the boar was
 too fierce to be beaten by strength,  
 so he followed it for many days and   
 found where and when it ate.          
 One day he hid in a tree where it fed 
 and when it had filled itself it went 
 to sleep. He promptly attacked it and 
 a fierce battle followed. He at last  
 killed the boar but was so tired that 
 he simply cut out its tongue as proff 
 of his victory.                       
 Whilst he slept, a stranger found the 
 boar dead and, not seeing Pollard, cut
 off its head and took it to the Bishop
 to claim the reward.
