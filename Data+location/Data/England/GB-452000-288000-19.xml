		<title>19INTERVIEW WITH FARMER</title>
		<content> Mr Bettle farms 150 acres, has one 15 
 yr old small tractor which was Â£500   
 and a larger 5 yr old tractor which   
 was Â£3000, both being second-hand. The
 dairy farm is over 100 yrs old. Mr    
 Bettle has had it for 7 yrs. Rent per 
 acre: 1920 was Â£20, 1985 is Â£70, now  
 totalling Â£10,500 annually. Every day 
 he starts milking his cows at 6:30am, 
 at 8:30am has breakfast, cleans the   
 yard and supervise jobs until 4:00pm, 
 when cows are milked again. After     
 supper at 6:30pm he does office work. 
 Cows are kept inside October/January, 
 graze outside in April, repairs done  
 in May, silage for winter feed is cut 
 in June/August, and calves are born   
 and reared from July/October. Farmers'
 winter problems are keeping cattle fed
 and clearing snow from the drive      
 enabling lorries to collect milk.
