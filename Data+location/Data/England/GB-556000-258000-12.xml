		<title>12FARMING AND THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content>    The farmer at{Chalk Farm}often does
 straw-baling for other people as there
 has been a lot of public concern about
 setting fire to the waste straw after 
 combining. He sells the straw as      
 animal bedding, often to the racing   
 stables at Newmarket, but sometimes to
 far-away areas such as Wales. There   
 is not a very regular market for      
 straw.                                
    Some of the harvest from each      
 year's crop is kept for seed. Other   
 seed is bought from a local merchant  
 at Swaffham Bulbeck who also buys in  
 some of the farm's produce. The farm  
 also buys fertilisers, diesel fuel,   
 wire and string.
