   I live in East Anglia in the town of
Ipswich.  I live  in  Goring  Road,  at
number 61.  I have a garden  but at the
end of my road is a recreation site and
I  play  there.   It  has  two  sets of
swings, one round-about, a log  fort, a
slide, a  climbing frame  and  toilets.
                                       
   My  house  is  a semi-detached house
with   a  living  room,   dining  room,
kitchen, three bedrooms and a bathroom.
In my bedroom  is a chest  of  drawers,
two shelves,  a work desk  and  a  bed.
There  is  a  vegetable  patch  in  the
garden  and a lawn,  a flower border, a
yard  for  my dog, a  shed and a green-
house.   We  have  a  garage  as  well.
                                       
   Goring Road is a long straight road.
It is not  very  busy  but it is always
alive.                                 </content>
