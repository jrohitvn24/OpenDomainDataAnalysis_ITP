 and a Spire the clock chimes every    
 half hour but has no face you can go  
 into the Clock tower.While the War was
 on the church got hit by a land mine  
 the left wing got Destroyed and had to
 be rebuilt.They had the organ put in  
 an organ loft and a cross suspended   
 above the entrance to the chancel.    
 They had to close the church now      
 because of vandalism.There was a bell
