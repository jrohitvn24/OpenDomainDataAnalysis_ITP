		<content>{WILLOW FARM LEGBOURNE                 
 Mr.Clarey runs his 140 acre pig farm  
 alone apart from one extra worker     
 during harvest.700 pigs including 3   
 boars and 65 sows are reared indoors. 
 The Large White/Landacre crossbred    
 sows on average produce 22 piglets per
 year.The piglets are fattened up on   
 home produced meal of wheat and barley
 plus protein additive and soya beans  
 in 22 weeks.When the pig leaves the   
 farm its weight is 80kgs and 60kgs    
 when slaughtered. The pigs are bedded 
 on straw wuth automatic feeding and   
 watering systems which minimise       
 labour.20sows and a boar run outside  
 in a grass field for 6 weeks whilst   
 repairs are made to the farm          
 buildings. Every fortnight 50 pigs are
 collected and taken to the abattoir in
 Essex to be slaughtered for pork and  
 bacon.                                </content>
