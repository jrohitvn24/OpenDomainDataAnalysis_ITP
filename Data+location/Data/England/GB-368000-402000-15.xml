		<content>     Competitions such as bingo        
 are used by the Journal to maintain   
 reader interest during times of       
 reduced circulation due to competition
 or price increase.                    
     The{qualities of a good reporter  
{include,}asking questions, listening, 
 a good command of English and         
 impartiality.   'News' for the paper  
 comes from reporters, public meetings,
 the general public and the police,    
 fire and ambulance services.          
    {The issues that concern the people
{of Little Hulton,}essentially a large 
 council housing estate, are increased 
 council rents, poor housing           
 maintenance and increased petty crime 
 like mugging and thefts.              
     Despite an uncertain future the   
 Journal claims to be the best         
 detailed historical record of the     
 people and events in this area.       </content>
