		<content> One of the chief features in our area 
 is the M.25 construction being        
 undertaken by Balfour Beatty          
 Construction Ltd. They are working on 
 contract 4 which is due for completion
 in the Autumn of 1986. It covers a    
 5.4.km section of the M.25. Most of   
 the work is done in the months when   
 the weather is dryer but even in      
 winter, earth moving plants are at    
 work excavating sites &amp; changing the  
 landscape. Contract 4 follows the old 
 A.6. and by-passes Potters Bar. It is 
 a difficult section to build because  
 of the large amount of traffic it     
 carries daily. This has meant         
 seventeen traffic diversions and the  
 building of temporary roads and       
 bridges.It's most impressive feature  
 is the access point at bignell's      
 corner where the motorway crosses over
 the A.1.                              </content>
