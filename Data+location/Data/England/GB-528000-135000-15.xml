		<content> Worthlodge Forest is on the road from 
 Worth to Balcombe. It consists of     
 mixed coniferous and deciduous trees. 
 Worthlodge Forest is crossed by public
 footpaths, tractor tracks and         
 bridleways. Because of the clay soil  
 and not much sunlight there are few   
 flowers, but the ones that are there  
 are Buttercups, Celendines, Foxgloves 
 and Nipperwort. In Spring, Bluebells  
 cover the floor. The forest is covered
 in fern. The main coniferous trees are
 Pine, Larch and Norwegian Spruce and  
 the decidious trees are Lime, Oak and 
 Sweet Chestnut. There are wild deer,  
 rabbits and squirrels. The pine is    
 used as timber and the Norwegian      
 Spruces are sold as Christmas trees.  
 The forest belongs to the Trustees of 
 Paddock Hurst. The only buildings were
 a small pig farm and a run-down       
 farmhouse.                            </content>
