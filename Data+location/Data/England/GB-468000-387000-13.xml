		<title>13The Priory Now</title>
		<content> The priory, 1 mile away from the      
 village of Mattersey is in the care of
 the Ministry of Works. It is in ruins 
 but it has kept well. The grassland   
 and the old stone walls are well cared
 for. There are three arches still     
 intact and one arch door in the small 
 church. There is a small kitchen with 
 a serving hatch. The cloisters are not
 very large and there is a small pillar
 in a wall. The wall has protected it  
 from the wind and bad weather. Where  
 there are no walls left, there are    
 neatly kept paths which show where the
 walls should be. the river flows along
 the north eastern edge of the priory. 
 There are still some old steps going  
 up to a different level. The church   
 still has some sort of tower. On the  
 nothern edge of the perimiter fence   
 there is an old farmhouse built with  
 stones from the priory.               </content>
