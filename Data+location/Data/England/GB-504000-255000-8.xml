		<content> On weekdays after school I have ballet
 lessons on Tuesdays, swimming and     
 horse riding on Wednesdays and I go to
 Brownies on Thursdays. The game that  
 we play most at Brownies is Captain's 
 Coming. It is my favourite game. Brown
 Owl tells us what we have to do like  
 "scrub the deck". When she says "scrub
 the deck" we have to kneel down on the
 floor and scrub the floor. The last   
 Brownie to do the action is out of the
 game.                                 
 Saturdays and Sundays are different.  
 On Saturdays I play the violin at     
 Junior Strings in Bedford and on      
 Sundays I have a free day.
