		<title>11FISHING IN THE CUT</title>
		<content> The "Cut" is the Bridgewater Canal.   
 This was built in the eighteenth      
 century by the Duke of Bridgewater to 
 carry coal from his mines at Worsley  
 to the River Mersey at Runcorn.       
 Now it is only used for recreation.   
 Many people have canal barges which   
 chug through Lymm and Grappenhall     
 along the "Cut".  Some people live on 
 the boats all the time and many of the
 boats are brightly painted.           
 Fishing is also very popular along the
 canal.  A large variety of fish can be
 caught including carp, rudd, perch,   
 tench and roach.  The best time to    
 fish in the summer is between 8 and 1O
 pm when the fish are feeding.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
