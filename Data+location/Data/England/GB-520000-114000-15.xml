		<title>15THE VILLAGE HALL HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>   The Village Hall was finished in    
 1974.  It replaced the Old Assembly   
 Rooms.  These are now shops.  It is   
 off the High Street and has its own   
 car park.  It has a stage, a small    
 hall, committee room, kitchen and     
 houses the Parish Council Office and  
 Museum.                               
   The Village Hall is very important  
 and handy because you can hire it for 
 all kinds of things.  The W. I. go    
 there for meetings.  At Christmas     
 people give parties and perform       
 pantomimes.  I go there for gymnastics
 and we have a good time.  The B. P.   
 Guild meet here.  Ballet and Judo     
 classes are held.  It can be used for 
 receptions.  All sorts of Clubs use   
 the Hall including the Badminton and  
 Flower Group.  I think it is a very   
 useful and good place.  It is the     
 centre of our entertainments.         </content>
