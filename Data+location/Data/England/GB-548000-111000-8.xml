		<title>08ROAD SAFETY AROUND LAUGHTON</title>
		<content> Road safety is an important matter in 
 Laughton, especially for young        
 children. Most of the roads around the
 village are best described as lanes:  
 they are narrow, usually with hedges  
 on both sides. In many places it is   
 difficult for two cars to pass each   
 other; indeed a mother taking her     
 children to school recently drove into
 a ditch as she tried to avoid a cattle
 wagon.                                
 Perhaps the worst problem is the lack 
 of traffic in the lanes. Children may 
 well see more horses (mostly from the 
 nearby stud farm) than cars on the    
 lanes. This can breed complacency. In 
 an attempt to counteract this the     
 school ran a Cycle Proficiency course 
 this year.                            
 Few people live by the B2124, the main
 road through Laughton. A 30mph speed  
 applies, but not all drivers obey it. </content>
