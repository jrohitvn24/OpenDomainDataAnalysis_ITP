		<title>09QUARRY/REFUSE TIP GREENSIDE</title>
		<content> The quarry at Greenside has been in   
 use since 1935. Five trucks work 8    
 hours a day throughout the year. They 
 extract 1000 to 2000 tonnes of sand   
 per day which is mainly used for      
 building purposes. The deep holes     
 made by digging out sand are now being
 filled with refuse from Newcastle and 
 Gateshead. They have been using the   
 site for 15 years. 2000 tonnes of     
 refuse are tipped there every week.   
 100 - 150 lorries go there and they   
 are not small lorries as each one can 
 hold 12 tonnes of refuse. Green nets  
 cover the lorries as they are driving 
 to the tip. Bulldozers flatten the    
 rubbish.When one hole is filled a     
 layer of soil  is put on top and grass
 seed is sown. As soon as the grass is 
 established framers can use the land  
 for grazing. After 21 years  building 
 procedures can be taken.              </content>
