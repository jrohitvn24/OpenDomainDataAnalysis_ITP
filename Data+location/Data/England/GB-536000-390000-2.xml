		<title>02AN ORDINARY DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> It is 7a.m. on Friday May 19th 1985   
 and my mum has just wakened me up.    
 I was quite tired so I had just five  
 more minutes in bed.My younger brother
 Matthew is still fast asleep.Without  
 waking him I get out of bed and get   
 dressed and get my training shoes and 
 shorts ready for school.              
 When I get downstairs Igo to the      
 toilet and then get washed.It is      
 difficult to get the toothpaste out of
 the tube because there is not much    
 left.                                 
 I go into the kitchen to see mum.She  
 asks me to feed the bantams and stoke 
 the boiler.When I have done these     
 jobs,breakfast is ready and Matthew   
 starts to emerge from the bedroom in  
 his pyjamas.We have breakfast and the 
 time is about 8a.m.                   
 Now I go upstairs to make my bed and  
 get my things ready for school.       </content>
