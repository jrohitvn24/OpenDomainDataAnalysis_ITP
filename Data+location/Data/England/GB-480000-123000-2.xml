		<content>    Much of the surrounding terrain is 
 undulating land used for arable       
 farming for such crops as wheat, oats 
 and barley. Trees, however cover a    
 large portion of the land.A mixture of
 evergreens and deciduous they provide 
 much of the local small industry      
 hidden away in the woods where it is  
 cut, dried and stored. Whole patches  
 are cut for coppicing to be used in   
 fencing. One man we heard of spent his
 entire day working alone just         
 coppicing his patch quite content     
 among the stumps without anyone to    
 talk to.                              
    The woods are  also used for horse 
 training. There are at least two      
 cleared areas set out as dressage     
 rings and much evidence of horse      
 exercise on the footpaths. A rich     
 middle eastern gentleman  owns one    
 such school.                          </content>
