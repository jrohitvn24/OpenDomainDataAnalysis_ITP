		<content> The Hill between Laverstock and Cockey
 Down is known locally as{'Panda Hill'.
 Cut deep into the chalk side is the   
 outline of the face of a Panda. This  
 quite mysteriously appeared one night 
 during the early '70s. The owner of   
 the land, living at Coombe Bissett,   
 was not aware of its presence at all  
 for a while. Over the years, it{has   
{become a popular,albeit illegal, local
{landmark.}There have been several     
 attempts to keep it restored by local 
 groups, but so far these have been    
 firmly resisted. Most recently the    
 local Parish Council are attempting to
 persuade the owner to relent to allow 
 proper restoration. It was that on one
 night during the autumn of 1972, some 
 eager, over zealous students from the 
 University of North Wales, Bangor, had
 carved a 7-10metre  representation of 
 the Student Union emblem, in the turf.</content>
