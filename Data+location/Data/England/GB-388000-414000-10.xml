		<title>10WARDLEWORTH</title>
		<content> .I live in Wardleworth.My street is   
 Rothwell St.next to Park Road.I like  
 my next door neighbours because they  
 are not noisy and don't shout.There is
 a library nearby and you can choose   
 four books.                           
  There is a big park nearby and we    
 play on the swings and slides.I live  
 near a good chip shop and the lady who
 owns it is Scottish.Next door to the  
 chip shop lives my friend Azra.Near   
 Azra's house is a fruit and vegetable 
 shop which also sells general         
 groceries.Nearby there are some new   
 houses being built.They are very      
 beautiful and have gardens.I think    
 that Wardleworth is a good place to   
 live in but if I could change it I    
 would like to see more grass and trees
 and less roads and pavements.
