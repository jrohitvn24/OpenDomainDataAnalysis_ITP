		<content>   THE CONURBATION OF POOLE,           
 BOURNEMOUTH AND CHRISTCHURCH IS, BY   
 FAR, THE LARGEST BUILT-UP AREA IN     
 DORSET AND THIS BLOCK IS SITUATED IN  
 THE SOUTH-EAST CORNER OF BOTH THE     
 CONURBATION AND THE COUNTY.  THE      
 BLOCK INCLUDES THE CENTRE OF          
 CHRISTCHURCH AND THE BOURNEMOUTH      
 DISTRICTS OF POKESDOWN AND            
 SOUTHBOURNE. THESE WELL-ESTABLISHED   
 RESIDENTIAL AREAS HAVE GOOD LOCAL     
 SHOPPING CENTRES AND THERE ARE SEVERAL
 OTHER SMALLER SHOPPING AREAS SUCH AS  
 TUCKTON.                              
   RUNNING WEST-EAST ACROSS THE  BLOCK 
 IS THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND.  THERE 
 ARE CLIFFS AND SANDY BEACHES WHICH    
 ATTRACT MANY VISITORS AND LOCAL PEOPLE
 IN THE SUMMER. THOUGH THERE ARE       
 HOTELS, GUEST HOUSES AND SERVICE      
 INDUSTRIES IN THIS BLOCK THERE ARE NOT
 AS MANY AS IN THE TOWN CENTRE.        </content>
