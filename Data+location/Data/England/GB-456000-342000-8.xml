		<content> In Arnot Hill Park is a big house,    
 built for Hawksley the owner of a     
 textile mill,built in the park.After  
 several changes of owners,it was used 
 as a hospital in 1918.In 1921 Arnold  
 Borough Council(now Gedling)bought it 
 for their new Council Offices.At      
 present,at a cost of 1600000 pounds,  
 the new Council offices are being     
 built.Now the house is surrounded by a
 variety of trees,with an ornamental   
 pond with a lot of wild fowl and a    
 fountain.The park contains a Fire     
 Station and the road works depot.Also 
 there are a war memorial,swings,pond,a
 lodge and an aviary.There is also the 
 remains of a railway,converted to a   
 path along a little cutting.The head  
 gardener sleeps in a room in the house
 when he wishes,as a guard.
