		<title>02Staplehurst Village</title>
		<content>   The village of Staplehurst,"staple" 
 meaning a wooden post or marker and   
 "hurst" a forest or wood, is dominated
 by its 975 year old church which is   
 situated on a hill. Although there are
 many Tudor houses (fine old Loddenden 
 Manor being one of them) a number of  
 new housing estates surround the      
 village which now has a population of 
 about 6000. One of the reasons for    
 this is the good rail links with the  
 capital. There are also good links    
 with the coast and with the county    
 town of Maidstone. In the centre of   
 the village is a small shopping parade
 which includes a supermarket and two  
 banks.If needed there are three       
 doctors and two dentists on hand.For  
 recreation we have six public houses  
 or for younger people such diverse    
 organisations as cub scouts and a     
 marching band.                        </content>
