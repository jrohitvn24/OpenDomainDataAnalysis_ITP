		<title>18IRON ORE, RAILWAY, COTTAGES</title>
		<content> The iron ore industry was once very   
 important in the area and this can be 
 seen in the place names e.g. Cinder   
 Banks, Kiln Wood, and Burnt Place. The
 railway goes through Cinder Banks     
 which is a charcoal burning site. The 
 Tunnel cottages were first built for  
 the people who, in the 1800s, built   
 the Balcombe Tunnel. Railway workers  
 still live there. One of the present  
 occupants is an ex railway employee.  
 Near the houses is an air shaft. In   
 the winter the tunnel caused the      
 London to Brighton Line to be closed  
 because there were icicles falling    
 from the shaft. The people who live   
 in a house called Wagon Wheels said   
 that when they moved in 25 years ago  
 there was very little traffic along   
 the road but now the High Street is a 
 dangerous and busy road. There are no 
 local shops and no bus service.       </content>
