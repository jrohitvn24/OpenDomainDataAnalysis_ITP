		<title>03WEDNESDAY CATTLE MARKET LEEK</title>
		<content>The Cattle Market was originally where 
Smithfield shopping centre and the     
Monument are today moving to Junction  
road out of the town centre in 1955.It 
is owned by the Leek auctions.         
The auctioneer stands in the middle of 
the pen to receive the bids.There are 3
pens,one is for dairy cows,the second  
is for sheep and the odd pig and the   
last pen is for cows for slaughter.Also
in the last pen are cows for rearing   
and then to be taken back when they    
can't produce milk and slaughtered.    
Farmers come to this sale from as far  
away as Sheffield and Derby.There are  
complaints sometimes about the pens and
facilities and some farmers feel that  
Leek Cattle Market is too small.Many   
hill farmers however regard Leek Cattle
Market with great affection.
