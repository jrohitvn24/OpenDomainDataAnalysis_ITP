		<content> Mount Wellington was operational{ corn
{mill} well  into this century.   Mill-
 leat,  3  cottages  &amp;  farm  buildings
 remain,   but  grain  not  now grown  
 locally.   Another cornmill existed on
 site  of  Greeta House and 2 cottages.
 In  1849  a factory, mill house and  4
 cottages  were  here.   Thomas &amp; Henry
 Smithies began the {cotton mill}c.1760
 and it was  sold on  Richard Smithies'
 death  in  1840.  The  new owner, Levi
 Towler, came from Colne.  In 1896 Ford
 Ayrton's,  silk-spinners, Low Bentham,
 rented the premises  but  the mill was
 closed in 1904. Thomas Coates used the
 mill - race  to  power   his   pottery
 machinery for  a time.  Present sewage
 field  was  the site of his  clay-pans
 and  his  engine bed  can  be found on
 Greta  Heath.  Traces  of  a weir also
 exist.
