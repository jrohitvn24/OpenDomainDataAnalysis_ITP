		<title>17A FARMWORKER'S YEAR</title>
		<content> The morning starts by herding the cows
 to the milking parlour to be milked by
 the machine.After that they are taken 
 to the field.The same worker will     
 either cut the grass or turn it so    
 that the sun dries it and makes hay.  
 Most of the summer is spent in the    
 fields making hay and silage.In the   
 Autumn the harvest will begin and the 
 ground will be fertilised.If the land 
 has been used for crops they will then
 plough.In Winter the cows are kept in 
 stalls and the farmworker has to fill 
 the feeding troughs every day with    
 silage and hay.The cows are bedded on 
 straw which is kept in a big barn.To  
 clean the yard the cows are herded to 
 one end then a small tractor with a   
 scraper scapes up the muck, which is  
 then stored in a slurry pit for use   
 later.
