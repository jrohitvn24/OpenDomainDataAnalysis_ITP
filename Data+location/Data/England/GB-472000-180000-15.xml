		<title>15Valley Road Primary School</title>
		<content>Valley Road Primary school, Henley-on- 
Thames was built in 1970. It was built 
for 200 children. The school was built 
in this area because lots of houses    
were being built around this area. At  
first the school had eight teachers.   
Before the school was built, there were
fields. The school is mainly built of  
bricks, glass and wood. It has had two 
head teachers since, Mrs. Nisbet and   
Mrs. Ruffell. There were two terepin   
buildings. John Humphries, Nick Spargo 
and H.E.Todd have visited the school   
which is open plan in design.
