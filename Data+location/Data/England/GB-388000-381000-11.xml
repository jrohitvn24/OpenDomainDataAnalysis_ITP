		<title>11A day in my life</title>
		<content> We go out of the halland go back to   
 our classrooms where we do some       
 work.We usually start by taking out   
 our maths books.I sit next to James   
 and Mark and so I work with them.At   
 10.25 we go out to play.We either play
 football or throwing.Occasionally we  
 are allowed to play on the field.We   
 only have twenty minutes for playtime 
 and it goes very quickly.We continue  
 with maths for about another ten      
 minutes and then we finish.Next we get
 out our English books and continue    
 with some aspect of English until     
 dinnertime at 12 noon.                
  At noon we go to the hall to eat our 
 dinner.My friends and I all bring     
 packed lunch for dinner.It only takes 
 us a short time to eat our dinner and 
 so we go out to play for the rest of  
 the time.After what seems a short time
 it it time for the juniors to go in.  </content>
