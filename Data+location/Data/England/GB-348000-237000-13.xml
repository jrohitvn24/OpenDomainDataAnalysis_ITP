		<content> Interview with local shopkeeper       
 conducted by two 6 year olds.(Extract)
{ Q:-What are the most popular foods?  
  A:-In this area many people live     
 alone and cook for themselves so we   
 sell many oven-ready meals,also milk, 
 bread,crisps and sweets.              
{ Q:-Do you sell local fruit and veg.? 
  A:-Yes, I should think half the      
 fruit and vegetables we sell comes    
 from private people around here. From 
 a local firm I buy more exotic fruits.
{ Q:-Is there a need for a local shop? 
  A:- Two years ago this shop was      
 closed. We reopened it and if there   
 was no need, we wouldn't be doing as  
 well as we are.                       
{ Q:-Might you sell anything else?     
  A:-I've been thinking of selling     
 flowers as the hospital is nearby and 
 the visitors could buy them.
