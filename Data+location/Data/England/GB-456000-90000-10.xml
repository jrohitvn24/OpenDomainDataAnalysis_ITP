		<title>10Houses in Ryde</title>
		<content>   In{Ryde}most of the{roads are       
{straight}and the houses are mostly    
{Victorian houses.}My house is one     
 hundred and thirty nine years         
 old.There are many kinds of houses in 
 Ryde and many of the Victorian houses 
 are built of{yellow brick.}Builders   
 today use{red bricks}because they are 
 cheaper.                              
   When builders start a house ,they   
 dig{deep foundations}especially as    
 Ryde has a{clay soil.}Builders use    
 bricks, cement, timber, tiles and     
 glass to build a house.Tarred felt is 
 used to damproof and on the roof.     
   In Ryde the large Victorian houses  
 are nearly all{converted into flats or
{hotels.                               
   The{majority of homes are privately 
{owned}but there are council estates   
 which are mostly rented.
