		<content>   As our school (Earley St.Peter's    
 C.E. School) is a Church of England   
 one it is not surprising that 74% of  
 the children are of that religion.    
   14% of the children are             
 Non-Conformist (Christians), 9% Roman 
 Catholic and 3% are Islam, Sikh,      
 Bahai or Jewish.  Although the school 
 is Church of England there are no     
 problems between different sects.     
   The disappointing discovery in this 
 section is that only 28% of our       
 children are regular church attenders!
 This 28% is made up mainly of the non-
 conformists and the Sikhs.  25% attend
 church on the "odd" weekend and 47% do
 not attend at all.  Of that 47% a     
 considerable number said they went if 
 they had to with the school! Some said
 "Christmas only" and others said "If  
 we are up in time".
