		<title>10TYPICAL DAY FOR THE TEACHER</title>
		<content>{                                      
  I live fairly close to school, so I  
 do not have to get up too early;      
 usually at 7.30. I arrive in school at
 8.25 and start by going to my class   
 then to the staff-room. There are     
 usually some children already in      
 class, since they fetch the computer, 
 and they start to work immediately. I 
 start properly at 8.55, when the      
 majority of the children come into    
 school. The children have each planned
 their work (either as pairs or groups)
 so they start their work immediately. 
 I am on hand to discuss and offer any 
 suggestions I might think neccessary. 
 My day is therefore spent talking to  
 the children and helping or ensuring  
 that their needs are met. I spent my  
 free time running clubs of various    
 sorts, and preparing work. I mark work
 with the children.                    </content>
