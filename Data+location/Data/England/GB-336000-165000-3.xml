		<content> The low_lying nature of the landscape 
  means that it is in constant danger  
 of flooding from surface land water   
 and sea water at times of high tide   
 and storm.In both villages the surface
 water drains into the rhines which in 
 turn flow into the Congresbury Yeo and
 thence into the sea .The flow is      
 governed by a series of sluices,      
 operated electronically, managed by   
 the Wessex Water Board.The sluices    
 allow the fresh water to escape when  
 necessary but prevent the salt tidal  
 water from getting into the waterways 
 to the detriment of plants and        
 wildlife. When ditches are filled in  
 for road widening or building great   
 care is taken to pipe them adequately 
 to ensure the proper flow of water.   
 Experience has shown that the         
 original rhine diggers were wise men  
 who understood the nature of the land.</content>
