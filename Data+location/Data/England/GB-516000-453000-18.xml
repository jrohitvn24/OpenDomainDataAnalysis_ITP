		<title>18CASTLE  HILL  2985 AD</title>
		<content> I am standing on top of Castle Hill.  
 The castle has been rebuilt and it is 
 a big tourist attraction in this      
 area.It is sunny today and lots of    
 families are just landing at the Heli-
 -park in their Heli-cars.The children 
 with their green, spiky hair are      
 shouting with excitement.Some families
 are arriving on the National Roller   
 Coaster Train and others are mooring  
 their Hover-marans in the Marina.Over 
 on Flamborough Head I can see the     
 ruins of the old lighthouse alongside 
 the Nuclear Power Station.Everything  
 is robot-controlled now so as usual   
 it seems to be running very smoothly. 
 A party is going to look round the old
 school.Children don't go to school    
 now of course.Ive never seen a real   
 school before so I'll just switch on  
 my jet pack and go for a look around.
