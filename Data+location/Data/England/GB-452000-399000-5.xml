		<content> THE DONCASTER STAR                    
 The{Doncaster Star}publishes 303      
 newspapers a year.  About 40 letters a
 week are sent to the Star.  The Star  
 has been running for two years.  They 
 took over from the{Doncaster Evening  
{Post}who went out of business.  Each  
 newspaper costs 16p.  The Star has 10 
 computers, and 1 main computer, which 
 costs Â£5 000 000.  The Star employs 35
 people but employs 1000 all over South
 Yorkshire.  Journalists usually work  
 about 9 hours a day, but can work up  
 to 18 hours a day.  An important issue
 in Warmsworth this year was the       
 excessive noise from a youth club     
 which annoyed neighbours.  The        
 newspaper is sold and published 6 days
 a week.  200 shops in the Doncaster   
 area order newspapers from the        
 Doncaster Star.
