		<title>14The Green Belt.</title>
		<content>   A problem that the children of All  
 Soul's Primary School found was the   
 protection of the {Green Belt}        
 surrounding Heywood. They are situated
 close to that part which separates    
 Heywood from Rochdale, and they found 
 that the increasing control of the    
 town's affairs, either by Rochdale    
 Metropolitan Borough Council, or      
 Greater Manchester Council, would     
 threaten that area. They conducted a  
 small survey near the school and found
 that people wanted to preserve the    
 Belt.If it was to be used at all, then
 it should be for Industry, to create  
 jobs, but not for Housing. They       
 visited {Farms} in the Belt and found 
 that farmers wanted to keep the land  
 for agricultural use and that they    
 were not prepared to sell it. This    
 whole situation may change after the  
 abolition of G.M.C. in 1986.          </content>
