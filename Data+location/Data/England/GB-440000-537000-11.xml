		<title>11FARMING NEAR PETERLEE</title>
		<content> Some farms are just crop farms.The    
 farm I live on is mixed-animals and   
 crops.We grow barley,oats,potatoes and
 turnips.My grandparents own the farm  
 and it is called Great Coop House     
 Farm.The animals which we keep are    
 cows,sheep,hens,horses,dogs and       
 cats.We keep the eggs and milk for    
 ourselves.The horses graze in the     
 fields.We have two collie dogs,seven  
 cats and two rabbits.                 
 My Dad goes out about 8o'clock in the 
 morning then milks the cows at about  
 8.15.My grandad takes some of the milk
 to feed the calves.They have their    
 breakfast next and sometimes they then
 fetch some hay to feed the calves.All 
 the work is done by my Dad and        
 Grandad.There are two tractors,one is 
 an old one and the other a new one.   
 I do not normally work on the farm.I  
 play with the animals.                </content>
