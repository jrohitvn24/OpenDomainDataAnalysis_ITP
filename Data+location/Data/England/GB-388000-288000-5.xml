		<title>05FARMING IN KINGSWINFORD</title>
		<content> In our area there are only two working
 farms, Park Farm which is normally    
 known as{Home Farm}and{Ketley Farm    
 which is just off Ketley Road in      
 Kingswinford.                         
{Home Farm}used to belong to the Earl  
 of Dudley and was part of the{Himley  
{Hall Estate.}In 1948 it was bought by 
 Mr. Knott whose family still own it.  
 The farm is mainly arable although    
 they keep cattle for grazing and also 
 breed pigs. The farm covers 150 acres 
 and is divided into fields, some of   
 which keep their original names such  
 as Black Barley, Drive and Church     
 Fields.                               
{Ketley Farm}is a rented farm and      
 covers 36 acres. It was built in 1813 
 and is a dairy farm with 27 cows.     
 There are also various fields in our  
 area kept for grazing horses; horse   
 riding being a popular pastime.       </content>
