		<title>17EDUCATION IN GRETTON</title>

   In the 1850's, a school situated    
next to the Parish Church was opened.  
It was a Church of England School and  
was owned by the Earl of Winchelsea,   
the Lord of the Manor of Gretton. In   
1870, it was extended because it was   
too small. The new building had three  
classrooms, two large and one small.   
                                       
   In 1909, this school closed, and a  
new one, the Gretton National School,  
opened at the other end of the village.
This school took children from the age 
of 5 until they started work. The name 
changed later to the Gretton County    
Primary School, and now takes children 
from 4 to 11 years of age, when they   
are taken by bus to a Comprehensive    
School in Corby five miles away.
