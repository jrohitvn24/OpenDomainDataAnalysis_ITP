		<content> A thousand years of occupation stamps 
 the landscape,Rigg and Furrow are in  
 evidence,also an old sunken road,now  
 used as a modern way.On the grassy    
 banks of this road and around the     
 village daffodils have been           
 planted.The two village greens        
 remain unchanged except for the tree  
 planting during the last ten years.   
 Two places of worship remain,the 800  
 year od church at East End,a new      
 chapel at West End replacing one biult
 in 1794.The village school,biult in   
 1961,replaced the old board school,now
 a private house,and the methodist     
 school,now a Christian youth centre.  
 Two public houses,now modernised,are  
 well used;they also serve food.Streets
 are lit by eletric lights.A derelict  
 wooden Memorial Hall,no longer in use,
 was replaced in 1984 by a new village 
 hall.                                 </content>
