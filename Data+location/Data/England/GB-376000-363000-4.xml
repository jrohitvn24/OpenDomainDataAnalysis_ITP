 mixed farms with cattle,cereal and    
 potato production and a few sheep.Most
 of them vary in size from approx,100  
 to 250 acres.                         
 The predominant enterprize is{dairying
 and without exception all the milk is 
 produced from the dairy cow.The       
 average herd size is about 100 cows.  
 Beef cattle are reared on some farms  
 to use the home-grown barley.         
{Potatoes}are a popular crop on about  
 one third of the farms with farmers   
 growing between 10 to 30 acres. Second
 earlies and maincrop potatoes are the 
 most common with one farmer producing 
 a quantity for crisps.

 the farmer either for lambing and     
 fattening or are just bought in for   
 finishing.Some are hill-sheep grazed  
 in the area and returned in the Spring</content>
