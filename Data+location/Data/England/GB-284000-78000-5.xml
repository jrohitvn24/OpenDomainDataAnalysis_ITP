		<title>05Law and order in Chudleigh</title>
		<content> The community policeman is a member of
 a team of 6 full-time police, one     
 Inspector and a sergeant who cover the
 area between Chudleigh and Mortonhamp-
 stead and Bovey Tracey.  There is one 
 car on the road at any time and a car 
 at Mortonhampstead.  There is not much
 crime in this "sleeply little hollow" 
 which used to be busy before the      
 motorway opened ten years ago, much to
 the relief of the locals.  Police work
 involves investigation of accidents,  
 thefts from vehicles, especially in   
 the summertime on Dartmoor, and the   
 odd burglary of outlying houses. There
 was a murder in Chudleigh Knighton    
 recently.  "There is the usual cross  
 section of crime but it is not on the 
 scale of the cities."
