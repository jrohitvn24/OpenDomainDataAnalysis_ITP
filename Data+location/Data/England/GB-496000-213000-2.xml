		<content>  The woodland around Little Gaddesden 
 is mostly deciduous trees like Beech  
 and Oak .Nearly all the woods belong  
 to Ashridge or the National Trust.    
 There are many different flowers and  
 plants scattered about the woods. In  
 Spring there are bluebells,primroses  
 and violets. In Summer there are      
 strawberries and blackberries. The    
 woods are also a perfect home for     
 birds like pheasants,woodpeckers and  
 smaller birds like the wren and robin.
 Around Ashridge you see a lot of      
 different kinds of deer which include 
 muntjack and fallow and a white deer  
 has been seen. Apart from deer there  
 are animals like rabbits and foxes.   
  Where there is no woodland there are 
 fields which mostly contain crops like
 wheat, corn or else cattle. There are 
 open spaces used for recreation.
