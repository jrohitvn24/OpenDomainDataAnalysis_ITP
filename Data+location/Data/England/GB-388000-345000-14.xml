		<title>14FENTON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>The Fenton or"Berry-Hill"Industrial    
Estate was built on reclaimed land.    
There used to be a colliery,brickworks 
and pot-bank here.The pit called"Top   
Pits"was opened in 1863 and closed down
in 1960. The reclamation took place    
between 1967-71. The ground now is very
flat. When we walked around the estate 
we saw factories and warehouses.The    
factories are very modern,many of them 
are large and are of various types.For 
example there is an ice cream factory  
and a concrete works.There is a cash   
and carry warehouse and a large        
distribution depot for steel.There are 
a lot of new developments around and in
the Industrial Estate and many parts   
have very nice landscaping.The         
environment is better than it used to  
be.The estate lies next to Victoria    
Road,the A50,an important transport    
route and a railway runs through it.   </content>
