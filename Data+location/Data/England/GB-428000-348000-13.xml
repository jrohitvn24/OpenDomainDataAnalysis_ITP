 Idridgehay is an old timber-framed    
 house called South Sitch. It is       
 Elizabethan in age it has beautiful   
 surroundings. It is a timber-framed   
 thatched roof building with plaster   
 filling in the spaces that are        
  between the timber-frames. Inside    
 South Sitch it is very grand and      
 complicated but in all it is a very   
 homely place. The Mellor family built 
 South Sitch in the sixteen            
 hundreds.The Mellor family added a    
 brick addition in eighteen forty. Some
 Cromwell weapons have been found in   
 the thatch of South Sitch and they are
 very valuable.In the grounds there are
 a few pools that were used to keep    
 fish in, and also there is an ice     
 house that was used to keep meat.
