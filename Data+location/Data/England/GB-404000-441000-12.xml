		<title>12KEIGHLEY NEWS</title>
		<content>    The "KEIGHLEY NEWS" is our local   
 newspaper.  It comes out every week.  
 It first came out on 5th Ajpril 1862, 
 priced 1 penny.  The first "Keighley  
 News" had just 4 pages, and the first 
 Editor was Mr. William Byles from     
 Bradford. For the first "Keighley     
 News" there were adverts on the front 
 page, the news was inside, with the   
 sports news mixed in.  There was a    
 village news section, although  a lot 
 of the news was actually world news.  
    Today the "Keighley Newa" is drawn 
 up in the office in Keighley; the     
 people who work on the news or        
 editorial section are:-
