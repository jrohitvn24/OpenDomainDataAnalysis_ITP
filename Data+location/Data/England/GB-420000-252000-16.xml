		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SARAH</title>
		<content> My clock radio wakes me at 7.00am to  
 Mike Read on Radio 1.I have Rice      
 Krispies for my breakfast but my      
 sister has Shreddies.At 8.30am I get  
 my school bag ready and set off for   
 school.My mum is getting Andy's       
 breakfast, he is our student who stays
 with us for a year.As soon as we get  
 into the classroom we go to our desks 
 and get our reading books out.I am    
 reading "Little Women"by Louisa May   
 Alcott.We have our first lesson which 
 is maths.At playtime the boys play    
 football and I sometimes practice     
 disco dancing with Anne_Marie.After   
 playtime our next lesson is English.We
 had to write a story about a magic    
 ring.Most people have sandwiches at   
 lunch time but I have school          
 dinners.They aren't very nice.After   
 dinner we do our project work.Home    
 time is at 3.30pm .                   </content>
