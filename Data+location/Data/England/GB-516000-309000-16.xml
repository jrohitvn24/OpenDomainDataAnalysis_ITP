		<title>16DEEPING ST.JAMES'WATCH'</title>
		<content>    Watch is a club especially for     
 people up to the age of 18,but anyone 
 is welcome.The aim of Watch is to pro-
 tect wildlife,and get people interest-
 ed in it.                             
    Our whole school is a member,so any
 child or their parents can go to the  
 meetings that are held from time to   
 time.                                 
    The sort of places we go to are    
 nature reserves,like Hills and Hollows
 in Barnack,where we have seen plants  
 such as bluebells,cow parsley,prim-   
 roses,pasque flower and hawthorn.     
    When we went to Ferry Meadows at   
 Nene Park,Peterborough,we went bird-  
 watching.The sort of birds we saw from
 the hides were lapwings,black-headed  
 gulls,and greenshank.                 
    While we were there we also went   
 pond-dipping,and caught pond-skaters, 
 leeches and great diving beetles.     </content>
