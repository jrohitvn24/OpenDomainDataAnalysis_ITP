		<title>15A TYPICAL FAMILY SUNDAY</title>
		<content> "We wake up at about 9.30 a.m.and go  
 downstairs to have some breakfast.We  
 then get dressed and possibly go to   
 church or go out for the morning. When
 we get back we usually sit down and   
 watch some T.V.and have a cup of tea  
 or coffee.After coffee we get the     
 lunch ready and sit in the garden.In  
 the summer we often have a Bar-B-Q    
 which is cooked by my Dad.This is     
 usually made up of 2 sausages,1 beef- 
 burger,1 piece of steak and a jacket  
 potato and some salad.After dinner we 
 go out with the band-"Runnymede Brass"
 in which all of our family play i.e.  
 Keith(Dad),Jean(Mum),Adele(Sister)and 
 myself(aged 12).We usually play from 3
 p.m. to 5p.m. and then go home.We have
 several places where the band play    
 including Thorpe Park,Windsor Safari  
 Park and the Rose and Crown in Thorpe 
 Village".   Gary Taylor aged 12 years.</content>
