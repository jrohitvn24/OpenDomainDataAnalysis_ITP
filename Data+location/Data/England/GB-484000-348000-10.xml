		<title>10FARMING-HOLME FARM,CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>       My father is a farmer. He has   
 been at Holme Farm all his life.      
       Holme Farm is a beef and arable 
 farm and has 350 acres. On the farm he
 has 200 cattle. He grows barley,reject
 vegetables that go to the cows, wheat,
 oil seed rape and grass. He employs   
 one farm worker.                      
       My father said he has a full    
 range of machinery for his crops.     
 These include a combine harvester, a  
 hay and straw baler, three tractors   
 with wheels for cultivation, ploughs, 
 disc harrows, power harrows, a        
 chemical sprayer and a fertiliser and 
 manure spreader.                      
       He starts work at 7 o'clock and 
 comes home at about 5.30. He has his  
 dinner at home. During harvest he is  
 up soon after dawn and does not come  
 home until dark.
