		<content> The{gas works}come from the North Sea 
 and it goes to Easington and after it 
 goes to Easington it goes through     
 Paull and after it has been through   
 Paull it goes to Hull and Beverley.The
{gas works}look like alot of pipes and 
 tubes.The pipes are long and round.   
 The{gas}is underground in the pipes to
 Hull and Beverley. All the other      
 places where it goes are small sites. 
 The{gas works}are near the farm. Lakes
 farm is the farm where the{gas mains }
 go through.                           
  The reason we don't have{gas}in      
 Paull is because the pressure of the  
 gas is too high for us.It would cost  
 hundreds and thousands of pounds to   
 get the gas down to the right pressure
 for the people of Paull to use.       
  Twenty people take it in turns to    
 come out to the terminal to check on  
 the{gas.                              </content>
