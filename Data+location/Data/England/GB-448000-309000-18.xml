		<title>18LANDSCAPE QUARRIES MARKFIELD</title>
		<content> HILL HOLE                             
 Hill Hole is a big disused quarry     
 which is full of water. It is about   
 150 ft. deep and supposed to have a 6 
 ft. pike in it which many fishers have
 failed to catch. It has steps going   
 down to a pump which pumps water into 
 the quarry.Divers use it for practice 
 but you are not supposed to swim in   
 it.It is very dangerous. There are    
 danger signs on Hill Lane but none on 
 Hillside.Betty Pegg is a high rock    
 beside the quarry. It was named after 
 a woman named Betty Pegg who committed
 suicide from there. It is about 200   
 ft. high and rockclimbers use it for  
 practice.Now the fishing season has   
 started people go to fish there and in
 the brickyard by Ratby Lane.There is a
 doorway in the middle of the rock. I  
 think it was a doorway for the workers
 when it was used.                     </content>
