		<title>06THE SEWAGE WORKS, EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> On Tuesday 18th of June we interviewed
 a man at the sewage works.            
 He was cleaning out one of the big    
 tanks.He said they had to be cleaned  
 out once a week.There were 3 tanks all
 10 foot deep.                         
 The sewage after its processed goes   
 into the sea by Straight Point. It    
 attracts fish, gulls and fishermen.   
 The man said he likes his job.        
 The tank is round. A bridge revolves  
 around it. It has brushes attached and
 they sweep the bottom as the bridge   
 goes round. The bridge is run by      
 electric. Also there is a big water   
 fall in the middle.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
