		<title>07The Community</title>
		<content>   There are two main settlements that 
 provide the focus of community life   
 in this area.The village of Gweek     
 which lies to the south of the grid   
 area and the village of Trewennack on 
 the eastern border.                   
   Gweek has a larger population than  
 Trewennack and a more extended        
 community network.i.e. a brass band,  
 football club, playgroup, dramatic    
 society, whereas Trewennack is now    
 without a shop of any kind and the    
 only focus of this large hamlet rather
 than vilage is the methodist chapel.As
 a consequence 'Trewennackers' tend to 
 link more closely with the nearby town
 of Helston.                           
   The common element shared by these  
 two groups is the primary school      
 placed at an equal distance between   
 the two as a result of historical     
 rather than educational developments. </content>
