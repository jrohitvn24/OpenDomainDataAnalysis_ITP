		<content> All together the G.E.C Research Centre
 takes up 45 acres of land and 1,071   
 people work there.The buildings have  
 been there since 1939.The 365 foot    
 mast on the site was used during the  
 war for communications and to track   
 down the German Luftwaffe,but today it
 is more of a hazard to aircraft as    
 there are no warning lights. The      
 Centre makes software and electronic  
 equipment.It makes parts for ships,   
 satellites and antennae.The parts are 
 bought by many different countries.   
 There is also a department for robots 
 and factory automation.They make      
 lasers.If you put your hand in front  
 of a laser,it would cut it off.When   
 they make a microchip,they have to    
 make it in a very clean room.If one   
 bit of dust gets into the works,it    
 would not function.
