		<content>  A game I enjoy is an intellectual    
 spelling game called 'Scrabble'which  
 can be played by two, three or four   
 players. Each player picks up seven   
 small plastic letters and then in turn
 each tries to make up words by putting
 them down on the board.Every letter   
 has a value and the object of the game
 is to try and score as many points as 
 possible by adding points won in each 
 word.The board itself has various     
 parts which allow the player to double
 the word score or treble the letter   
 score.                                
  Players take it in turns to try and  
 make words by using their letters as  
 they use up their initial seven they  
 replace them from the central         
 store,until such time as they are all 
 gone.Play continues until players have
 made all possible words then the final
 points total is found.                </content>
