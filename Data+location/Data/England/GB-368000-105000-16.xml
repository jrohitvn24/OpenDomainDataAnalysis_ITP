		<title>16BUCKLAND NEWTON IN 1945</title>
		<content> Employment was good in 1945.The jobs  
 were more or less the same as today.  
 The fuel used was coal, wood,         
 electricity and paraffin lamps. One   
 kind of lamp was a tilly lamp. The    
 entertainment was very different.     
 Instead of T.V. and computers, there  
 were dances.Farming has also changed. 
 Instead of tractors there were horses.
 The houses were much smaller,with only
 2 bedrooms upstairs and a kitchen and 
 washing room downstairs.Some houses   
 had no electricity.The fashion was    
 mid-calf dresses and skirts.The men   
 wore turn- up trousers.Older people   
 wore shawls and hats.Transport was    
 bus,bikes and walking.The village     
 hasn't changed much.There were two    
 small shops but one has been closed   
 down now.At school the children had   
 milk.It was warmed in the Winter.
