		<content> In south Warwickshire there is a      
 selection of schools at 11 years of   
 age.All children transfer to a senior 
 school but the choice of school to    
 some degree is based on an examination
 called the 11 plus .Those children    
 with the highest intelligence         
 quotients are offered places at King  
 Edward V1 Grammer school ,Stratford   
 _Upon_Avon(boys) or The Stratford     
 Grammer School for Girls at Shottery  
 Manor.The majority will transfer to a 
 High School in the area.The one for   
 this area is Kineton High School(1275 
 on roll).There are senior schools in  
 Leamington,Stratford and Warwick if   
 places are available.Transport is not 
 provided to schools outside the       
 catchment area.Two colleges of Further
 Education,one in Stratford_upon_Avon  
 ,the other in Leamington Spa,are      
 available for vocational courses.     </content>
