		<content>  We interviewed Mrs Bown, the         
 organiser and part-founder of a 'good 
 neighbour' scheme called{FISH.}The aim
 of the scheme is to help plug some    
 gaps in the official provision of care
 by the Social Services. In an         
 emergency, she can find volunteers to 
 provide transport to clinics and      
 hospitals, collect pensions, shop     
 etc.for people who are housebound and 
 helpless.                             
  The scheme was started 22 years ago  
 by a group of Christians from the     
 Parish as a deliberate effort to live 
 their christianity in the community.  
 It was the second in Britain, and the 
 first ecumenical one, involving all   
 the Christian churches of the parish. 
  Mrs Bown herself is well aware of    
 the problems ill health can bring: she
 suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and is
 confined to a wheelchair.             </content>
