		<title>12Infant Views on Farming</title>
		<content>{The}farm beside my house has corn and 
 oil seed rape and there is a very big 
 barn, where they keep all the combine 
 harvesters and sprayers.  There are   
 two alsatian dogs guarding the        
 machinery.  At the bottom of the field
 there is a little old bridge.  There  
 were some sheep in the field, but now 
 it is going to have crops.  It has got
 a damson orchard and a potato field.  
                                       
{On}my farm, I have got crops, cows,   
 calves, ducks, geese, chickens and a  
 horse.  Some nights, I go down with my
 Grandad on the farm, and I help my    
 Grandad milk the cows.  Our neighbour 
 has some sheep.                       
                                       
{When}I climb over the fence, I find   
 myself in the sheep field.  In the    
 next field, we've got our old friends 
 the horses, by the windmill.          </content>
