		<content> Acreage: 200 acres + 100 acres of     
 Southleigh Forest.                    
 There is a Farm Manager in charge     
 here, as the owner has other farms in 
 the area. The land is all put down to 
 grass to provide pasture for the      
 pedigree herd of Simmental cattle they
 breed for beef production.90 acres is 
 let out for the use of a herd of      
 pedigree Friesian cattle.             
 They are self sufficient in providing 
 food for their cattle during the      
 winter, and to this end they cut      
 silage and hay from the land. The     
 cattle are kept in covered yards      
 during the winter, and sheep are      
 imported from other parts of the      
 country to crop the grass during that 
 season.                               
 The Lavant streams run through this   
 area, and although the land is quite  
 well drained, the farm gets very damp.</content>
