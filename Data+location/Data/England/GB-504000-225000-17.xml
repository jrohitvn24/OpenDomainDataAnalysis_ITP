		<content> The area under study is a mixture of  
 rural and urban settlement and        
 displays a wide variety of housing    
 styles. There were very few buildings 
 in the village of Lower Sundon and    
 only one or two houses. The buildings 
 were old cottage style compared with  
 the larger village of Upper Sundon    
 which has some newer style houses.The 
 road slopes gently upwards from Lower 
 to Upper Sundon. Upper Sundon is more 
 modernised than Lower Sundon with the 
 better services such as post office / 
 general store and a park. On the      
 corner opposite "The Crown" stands a  
 war memorial. The two farms in the    
 area have 19 buildings between them.  
 Along MAnor road in Lower Sundon      
 stands "Mead House" and "Aubers Farm" 
 which are the two major buildings in  
 the village.                          
                                       </content>
