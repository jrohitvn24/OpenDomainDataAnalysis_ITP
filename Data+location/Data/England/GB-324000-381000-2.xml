		<title>02HOW PENSBY HAS CHANGED-CONT</title>
		<content>    There was no motorised transport   
 either.They could either walk or ride 
 bikes.The children had to walk to the 
 school in Barnston because there was  
 no school in Pensby.They took a bucket
 to school and they collected water    
 from the Well near by on their way    
 home.On Fishers Lane there was a      
 farmhouse,a few pig sheds and acres of
 fields full of corn. A bullfight would
 take place every year on Fishers      
 Lane.Now there is only one field and  
 many houses and shops.                
   The streets have changed too.       
 Electric lamps have been installed and
 the roads improved for motor traffic. 
 Where as years ago the people had to  
 walk everywhere, they can now use many
 different forms of transport.         
   The old folk say that Pensby has    
 changed to the better especially as   
 they can get around more easily.      </content>
