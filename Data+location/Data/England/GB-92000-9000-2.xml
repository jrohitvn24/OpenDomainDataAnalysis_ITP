		<content>     The farms in this area are small, 
 the largest being 56 acres. They      
 mainly grow flowers(early daffodils,  
 narcissi and soleil d'or being        
 specialities) and potatoes. The fields
 are small in strips protected from the
 strong winds and winter gales by tall 
 hedges of pittisporam and escallonia. 
 There are some dairy and beef cows    
 along with a few pigs, goats and      
 poultry. As the sea surrounds this    
 area there are several small lobster, 
 crawfish and crab fishermen. There are
 three or four small local trawlers    
 which catch hake,whiting,plaice,turbot
 dogfish,monkfish,skate,ray and        
 gurnard. In recent years, some of the 
 Cornish trawlers have come in search  
 of fish.
