		<content>    There are 10{Meetings}a year, one a
 month, the exceptions being August and
 September.   Meetings are held in the 
 Parish Hall from 7.10pm.              
    The{Members}of the Council are Mr  
 Babey, Mr Baker, Hrs Hollands, Mr     
 Mills, Mrs Penny, Mrs Reeves, Mr      
 Thomas and Dr. Wainwright.            
    There was no{Election}needed as    
 only 7 people put up for 9 places.    
 The Council advertised for 2 more     
 members.                              
 The Council has succeeded in getting a
 lollipop lady; lights under the       
 Motorwaybridge and prescriptions to be
 made up at the Post Office in the     
 mornings.   They are still fighting   
 for speed limits on the roads and to  
 stop too many planned extensions to   
 forest cottages.Rural bus services    
 were also something which was needed  
 but little used.                      </content>
