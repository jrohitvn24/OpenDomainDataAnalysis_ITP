		<title>16POLICE IN IRONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>    The little police unit in          
 Ironbridge was opened in 1970. PC     
 Cavendish, the local policeman, has   
 been with the police force for  12    
 years. When he is on his rounds his   
 orders come from the police station at
 Malinsgate, Telford Town Centre.      
    In this area police help the public
 find their lost dogs or by telling    
 them where to find certain places,they
 also help in accidents such as crashes
 where they have to find out whose     
 fault it was. PC Cavendish is mainly  
 on foot or bicycle, but if there is a 
 shortage of policemen, he drives a    
 panda car.                            
     The main problem in Ironbridge is 
 traffic especially on Bank Holidays.  
 In the past few years there have been 
 two fatal accidents killing five      
 people and injuring eight.
