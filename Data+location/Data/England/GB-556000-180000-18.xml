		<title>18Belhus Mansion.</title>
		<content> Belhus Mansion lies in the parish of  
 Aveley and was the seat of the Barrett
 family from the 14th century to 1644  
 when Edward Barrett died and it passed
 into the Lennard family.              
     The original house was extensively
 altered in the mid_18th century by    
 Lord Dacre,who also made the park     
 resemble a medieval deer park.The     
 famous gardener Capability Brown      
 helped him in this.                   
     At the end of the war Belhus      
 Mansion was sold and its contents     
 auctioned.After some years as a       
 private residence it was occupied by  
 troops in the Second World War,became 
 dilapitatedand was finally demolished 
 in 1957.                              
     Although the name of Belhus lives 
 on in the area ,only the foundations  
 of the once great house,together with 
 its ice tower remain.                 </content>
