		<title>03MINERAL EXTRACTION AYLESFORD</title>
		<content> Over the last 100 yrs minerals have   
 been extracted for industry.Between   
 Aylesford and Eccles sand and gravel  
 are worked.Aylesford Sand Co have 300 
 acres in our block.Half of the area   
 known as the "Southern Pits" has been 
 dug.Much of this has become filled    
 with water because of working below   
 the water table.Some of the banks     
 around the lake have very steep sides,
 the water is very deep and dangerous. 
 There are approximately 40acres of    
 water.The sand is used in building    
 ,road construction and glass making.  
 Sand is processed at Rochester Road   
 sand pit and taken all over SE        
 England.When they have taken out all  
 the sand the company will turn the    
 area,including the lakes in to a      
 sports ground with special facilities 
 for water sports.
