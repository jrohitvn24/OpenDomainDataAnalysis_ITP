		<title>10WINTERINGHAM OLD SCHOOL 1845</title>
		<content> Mr. Bell, who has lived in the village
 all  his life, started at the national
 school  in  1920.  There were only two
 classrooms,one for the infants and the
 other for children  up  to  14. In the
 infant room the seats  were  raised in
 steps. The room had a coal fire and an
 oil lamp.  There  were  no toys. There
 were three  classes  in the large room
 each doing  different  lessons. Pupils
 sat  on  long  forms at sloping desks.
 They  wrote  on  slates.  If  you were
 naughty you got  the  cane.  Only  one
 little  stove  heated this large room.
 The toilets,  wooden  seats  with pans
 underneath, were in the yard.  A lorry
 came  to  empty  them. There  were  no
 school dinners. Boys went each week to
 play football on a nearby field.      
 Mr.Bell was one of the first pupils at
 the new school opened in 1928.
