		<content> OTHER OLD PROPERTIES WITHIN THE       
 VILLAGE INCLUDE FARM BUILDINGS,WITH   
 ONE BARN DATING BACK TO 1789,A MILL   
 LATER CONVERTED TO A BAKERY AND AN OLD
 SCHOOL. THE LATTER WAS ESTABLISHED IN 
 1826 AND SERVED THE CHILDREN OF THE   
 AREA FOR OVER 150 YEARES UNTIL THE    
 PRESENT BUILDING WAS OPENED IN 1981.  
 HAYTON, THE OTHER SETTLEMENT OF ANY   
 SIZE WITHIN THE GRID,RUNS ALONGSIDE   
 THE CHESTERFIELD CANAL. THE CHURCH IS 
 AN OLD ESTABLISHED BUILDING DATING    
 BACK TO THE 13TH CENTURY. THE REST OF 
 THE VILLAGE IS OF MORE RECENT ORIGIN. 
 THERE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A CASTLE AT
 HAYTON BUT THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF THIS  
 IS IN THE NAME OF A FARM OUTSIDE THE  
 VILLAGE.
