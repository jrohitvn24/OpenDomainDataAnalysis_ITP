		<content>  Many people had only lived in the    
 area a short time, though many had    
 lived here for at least 5 years. We   
 asked what people liked to do in their
 spare time and the most popular       
 activety was reading. Second was      
 playing sports and third was          
 gardening. We also asked what they    
 liked most about the area. They       
 replied that they thought it was a    
 quiet and peaceful place. They liked  
 all the open spaces and they thought  
 that all the people were very         
 friendly.                             
  We wanted to know where people did   
 their shopping, and we discovered that
 most people went to a supermarket for 
 a lot of their food, but they still   
 went to other shops regularly. Bakers 
 and greengrocers were the most        
 popular.
