		<title>08ST.JAMES STREET STATION.</title>
		<content> Walthamstow is a good location for    
 travel facilities. There are various  
 ways of getting to places by using    
 trains,buses and taxis.               
 St.James Street Station is at the     
 beginning of the High Street but it is
 not the only one in our area.         
 The busiest time in the station is on 
 a Monday morning when up to a thousand
 people pass through to use the trains.
 There are five people working as      
 ticket collectors etc.They always try 
 to keep the trains on time. People at 
 the station are friendly and will help
 you if you need it.The Ticket         
 Collector is very polite and          
 helpful.He works almost 8 hours a day 
 and 39 hours a week. He said his job  
 is very interesting because it        
 involved meeting and talking to other 
 people.
