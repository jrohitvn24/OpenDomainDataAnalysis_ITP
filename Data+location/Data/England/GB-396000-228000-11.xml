		<title>11Adult Societies,Gotherington</title>
		<content> In Gotherington there are lots of     
 activities for adults.One of them is  
 called The Recreational Club.The      
 Recreational Club organise all village
 things like fetes,sports-days and     
 horse shows.They raise money for the  
 village.  The Tritons Club sometimes  
 put on plays or pantomimes which are  
 chosen by the members.Everyone says   
 what they think would be a suitable   
 play to act.They rehearse for about   
 two months and then they perform it on
 the Village Hall's stage.It is usually
 very good.Another club is called      
 Winemakers. Winemakers make wine and  
 they go away to lots of places but    
 they don't do anything really         
 exciting.One activity for ladies is   
 called Wives.At Wives they arrange    
 things like baby sitters for people   
 who are going out,they also have a lot
 of jumble sales.                      </content>
