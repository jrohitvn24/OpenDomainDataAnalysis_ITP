		<content>On the 12th June we went to Cheadle    
Police Station to meet some of the     
70 people who work there.First we went 
to the Mess Room &amp; waited for Mr       
Tierney.When he came we went to where  
they take photographs &amp; fingerprints.  
It is called the Interview Room.After  
that we went to the Cell Block,where   
the prisoners are kept.They were dull  
&amp; only had a mattress &amp; a wooden       
pillow,on top of the wooden pillow was 
a softer one &amp; a sheet.We went to look 
at the Police Cars.They were Ford      
Patrol Cars.They had two way radios    
&amp; flashing blue lights and a two tone  
siren.We saw the Lockers where the     
Police men keep their belongings       
before we returned to School. It was   
hard to imagine that long ago the      
Police Station was a Doctor's Surgery.
