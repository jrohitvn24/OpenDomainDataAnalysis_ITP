		<title>02CHANGING TIMES IN EGGINTON</title>
		<content> In the past Egginton hall was the most
 important building in the village     
 because the local gentry lived in it. 
 The Everys owned most of the buildings
 in Egginton and most of the land and  
 property. Since then Egginton has     
 changed alot.The population is greater
 and barns are being converted into    
 houses.A new estate has been built    
 which has enlarged the population of  
 the school.Now most people have cars  
 and so people have jobs outside       
 Egginton where as before people were  
 servants at Egginton hall,farmers or  
 farm labourers.Now most people work at
 Burton,Derby or East Midlands         
 airport.
