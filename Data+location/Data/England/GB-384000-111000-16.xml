		<title>16EMPLOYMENT IN SHROTON</title>
		<content>  SHROTON STILL PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT FOR
 A FEW PEOPLE. MOST OF THE FARMERS NOW 
 OWN THEIR LAND AND THEY HAVE TO BE    
 VERY WELL ORGANISED BUSINESS MEN TO   
 CONTROL A LARGE ACREAGE WITH ONLY A   
 FEW WORKERS. THEY USE COMPUTERS TO    
 PLAN SUCH THINGS AS FEEDING PROGRAMMES
 FOR THEIR COWS AND THE FORWARD        
 PLANNING OF THEIR CROPS IN EACH FIELD.
 A SMALL NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS ARE 
 FARM MANAGERS AND SECRETARIES. THERE  
 IS ALSO A HERDSMAN AND SOME           
 AGRICULTURE WORKERS. THERE ARE WARDENS
 WHO SUPERVISE THE BUNGALOWS FOR THE   
 ELDERLY AND THE FLATS IN THE RECTORY. 
 ONE WOMAN RUNS A GUEST HOUSE AND THERE
 IS A SELF-EMPLOYED BUILDER. A FEW     
 DOMESTIC JOBS STILL EXIST - THERE IS A
 COOK FOR RANSTON HOUSE WHO HAS HER    
 COTTAGE PROVIDED. THERE ARE ALSO SOME 
 GARDENERS.                            
  THERE IS LITTLE UNEMPLOYMENT.        </content>
