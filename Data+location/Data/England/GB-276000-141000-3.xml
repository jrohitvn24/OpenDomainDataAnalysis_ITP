     A well known landmark on Exmoor is
 Brendon Two Gates.                    
                                       
     Today, traffic passes freely      
 across the moor over a cattle grid.   
 One hundred years ago the two gate    
 system gave its name to this spot.    
                                       
     This system had two gates hung on 
 one post so that both fell inwards.   
 The winds could not blow both gates   
 open and farmers on horseback could   
 pass through without dismounting. They
 did this by pulling back one gate and 
 the horse, walking forward, pushed    
 open the other. There are no signs of 
 these gates today.                    
                                       
     From this spot there are large,   
 panoramic views of Exmoor.
