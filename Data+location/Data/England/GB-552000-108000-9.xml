		<title>09Dicker Day- a Carnival.</title>
		<content>  Upper  Dicker Day started in the 60's
 then it vanished for at least twenty  
 years . Then one summer they had a    
 carnival and retitled it Dicker Day.  
 It is held in July on the village     
 field.In the morning the floats go to 
 Michelham Priory to be judged. When   
 the floats are judged they are driven 
 to the village field. On the village  
 field there are lots of stalls like   
 book stalls, white elephant stalls,   
 refreshment stalls ect. Later in the  
 afternoon there is a dressing up      
 competition and the winner gets       
 his/her picture taken, and you get a  
 rosette. For the side shows they had  
 mini  rollercoaster, bouncing castle, 
 smash the crockery, lunar lander,     
 treasure island, fish the bottle, and 
 tombola.There are lots of children's  
 events like sack race, egg and spoon  
 race, piggy back race and running     </content>
