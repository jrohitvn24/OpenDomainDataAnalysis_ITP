 We talked to a lady who had lived in  
Finedon for 72years.She told us about  
life in 1945.Food was rationed,Old     
Joe's Cough Drops,from the market,were 
the only unrationed sweets.When her    
daughter was given a banana she didn't 
know how to eat it.                    
 In 1945 most houses did not have a    
bathroom and so you had an "up and     
downer" instead i.e. you washed        
yourself all over top-to-toe from a    
bowl.Floors were covered in linoleum   
and rag rugs.There was no running hot  
water and few inside lavatories.       
 In Finedon there used to be 4 schools,
now there are only 2, as secondary     
children go out of town and the junior 
schools have amalgamated.              
 Her first T.V was bought in 1953 for  
the Queen's coronation.It showed black 
and white pictures on a 9 inch screen. </content>
