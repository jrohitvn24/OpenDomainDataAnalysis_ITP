		<title>09DR. WILLIAM CAREY, MINISTER</title>
		<content>Carey was born in Northamptonshire on  
August 17th 1761. He was the eldest    
son of 5 children of a weaver, who     
later became a parish clerk. When Carey
left school he worked as a farm        
labourer, but a painful skin disease   
caused by exposure to the sun made him 
look for an inside job. Carey was      
apprenticed to a cordvainer (a         
craftsman who made shoes)named Clark   
Nicholls. Clake helped Carey with his  
studies of Greek out of a New Testament
Commentary book in Greek. On 10th June 
1781, just before Carey was 20, he     
married Dorothy Plackett. In 1785 Carey
moved to Moulton with his family. In   
1786 he was appointed Baptist Pastor in
Moulton. In 1789 he was made Pastor of 
Harvey Lane Chapel in Leicester. Now   
Carey lead a busy life of shoemaking,  
continuing Bible studies and preaching 
in the village churches.               </content>
