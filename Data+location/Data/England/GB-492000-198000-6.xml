		<title>06Shooting</title>
		<content>   One of my favourite hobbies is      
 shooting. I have a 20 bore shotgun and
 my father has always been careful with
 guns. My shotgun cost about Â£328 and  
 with that price the man gave me a     
 cleaning kit and a cover for the gun, 
 and also a box of cartridges which are
 Â£3.00 for 25. I find that people that 
 brag aren't usually very good at      
 shooting. Sometimes I wait in my hide 
 (A hide is a small space of ground    
 where you are camouflaged and you can 
 see the birds but they can't see you) 
 for hours upon end and I don't get    
 discouraged at all. I say better luck 
 next time. A good hide need be no     
 expense at all. All it takes is a bit 
 of time. I shoot at my grandma's where
 it overlooks the river. I find that   
 clay pigeon shoting is more fun than  
 actually shooting birds. You need a   
 machine to fire the clay pigeons from.</content>
