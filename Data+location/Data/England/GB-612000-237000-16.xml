    MY name is Sarah Chinn. I live in  
Tattingstone Village and go to         
Tattingstone School.A typical day for  
me starts at 8 o'clock when I get up.  
I go downstairs and have breakfast of  
marmite toast and cereal and a drink   
orange juice.I get washed and brush my 
teeth. Then I go back upstairs and get 
dressed and brush my hair.I play with  
Oliver,my dog,and then put his lead on 
and walk to school.I talk to my friends
until Mr Riley comes out and tells us  
to line up.We go and hang our bags and 
coats up and then we have assembly.    
    After assembly Mrs Williams takes  
out the 1st and 2nd years to do Indian 
topic work.Sometimes she takes the 3rd 
and 4th years for poetry workshop.If we
stay with Mr Riley we do English until 
break at 10.30 and then Maths from     
10.45 until dinner time at 12.00.      </content>
