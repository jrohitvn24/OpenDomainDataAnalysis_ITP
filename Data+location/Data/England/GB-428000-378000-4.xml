		<content> If you go down Chapel Lane you will   
 find a private residence which used to
 be the old village Methodist Chapel.  
 Totley Rise Methodist Church at the   
 bottom of the hill has a Sunday       
 School, Youth Group, and meets the    
 needs of the more mature too.Not far  
 away in Totley Brook Road is Dore &amp;   
 Totley U.R.C. Church, another lively  
 church with extensive premises.All    
 Saints' C. of E. Church in the older  
 part of the village has a beautiful   
 building with an unusual short tower  
 which has a pitched roof.             
 All Saints'C.of E. Primary School is  
 closely linked to this church and     
 holds school services in it on        
 festival days and at other times.     
 The R. C. Chapel of Ease of the       
 English Martyrs is on Baslow Road,next
 to the Green and the old pump.
