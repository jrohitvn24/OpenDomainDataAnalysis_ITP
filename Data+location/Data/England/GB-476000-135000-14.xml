		<title>14HEALTH IN BORDON</title>
		<content>   There are ten health centres in     
 Bordon.  The Elizabeth Dibbin Health  
 Clinic was opened in 1985 by Mrs      
 Elizabeth Dibbin.  It is the main base
 of the Health Visitors and District   
 Nurses of this area.  There is speech 
 therapy, physiotherapy, a chiropody   
 clinic, family planning and child     
 health clinic held there.  Also on    
 Forest Road is the Forest Surgery, the
 Pine Hill Surgery and Woolmer Surgery.
 The Pine Hill Surgery and Woolmer     
 Surgery were also opened in 1985.     
 There are two Dental Surgeries on     
 Chalet Hill and one in Park Street    
 where the Community House Social      
 Services are held. As Bordon is       
 growing into a small town a hospital  
 is being planned in Forest Road. For  
 accidents Aldershot is the nearest    
 hospital.
