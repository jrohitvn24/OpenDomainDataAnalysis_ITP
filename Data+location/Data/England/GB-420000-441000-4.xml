 things to play on - a big and a little
 climbing frame,some baby and some big 
 swings,a rocket and a boat for us to  
 climb and some monkey bars.There are  
 2 football pitches.My dad plays foot- 
 ball there for the Regent pub.There   
 is a tennis court and a bowling green 
 for the old people.Families can go for
 walks round the gardens.By{MATTHEW}

 The tarn is a big lake and people go  
 sailing there.Round the tarn there are
 trees and rocks.Some people take pic- 
 -nics in summer.The tarn has an island
 in the middle and sometimes people    
 swim out to it.There are ducks on the 
 tarn and children feed them.There     
 is also a B.M.X track and a park with 
 swings and slides for the little chi- 
 ldren to play on.By{ADAM ESCREET AND
