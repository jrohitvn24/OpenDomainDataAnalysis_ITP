		<content>An account of family life by a girl    
aged 11.                               
         A LAZY WEEKEND IN THE SUMMER  
                                       
I wake up at about 9.30am and lie in   
bed until about 10.00am. I get up,get  
washed and then get dressed.When I go  
downstairs I usually play on the organ 
and then have breakfast which is       
Weetabix with a lot of milk.When I have
finished, my older sister comes down   
for her breakfast. I go out and play on
the hog-swing in the garden(and get    
very dizzy). Mum and Dad and my sister 
come out into the garden and we all    
sunbathe until 12.30pm when we have    
some lunch.We relax and play throughout
the afternoon then come in and prepare 
for dinner time.After dinner we watch  
some television and then wash and go to
bed after a lovely lazy day!
