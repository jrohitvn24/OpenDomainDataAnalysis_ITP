		<title>10FARMING ON THE DOWNS</title>
		<content>                                       
      The area of the Downs within the 
 D-block is largely undulating{ chalk  
{hills,}most of which is owned and     
 farmed by several land owners.        
      We interviewed Mr. McCulloch who 
 farms at Thurle Grange. He owns 300   
 acres of land, but he farms 500 acres.
 The soil is chalky so the rain water  
 drains well. Mr. McCulloch grows      
{wheat, barley and triticale.}Triticale
 is a hybrid of wheat and rye which is 
 used to feed animals.                 
      The farmer owns 250{Friesian     
{bulls.}They are fattened for beef and 
 then sold.  He has{a flock of sheep   
 and{17 horses}as well as running a    
 livery yard.                          
      He employs 5 staff who use       
 machinery to help them. There is 1    
 combine and many tractors.            
                                       </content>
