  After assembly we start work. I have 
 18 children in my class, varying in   
 age from 4 to 7. The children are     
 divided in groups for work and the    
 work is integrated. At break the two  
 of staff share playground duty. The   
 children                              
 can play all round the school and on  
 the garden.                           
   We all have lunch together in the   
 hall. The parents cook the lunches on 
 a rota system, and they are delicious.
   After lunch during my dinner break I
 make telephone calls and sign the     
 letters the secretary has left for me.
  In the afternoon we have P E and     
 games. Then we have a story before we 
 go home. I am usually at school until 
 about 4.30 unless I have a meeting.   
 Then I take the paperwork home to do. </content>
