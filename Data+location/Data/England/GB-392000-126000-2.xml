		<title>02WARDOUR CHAPEL</title>
		<content>{Wardour Chapel}was built in{1776. }It 
 is called the{Church of All Saints.}It
 is a very beautiful church because a  
 very rich man (called{Lord Arundell}) 
 built it.At that time it was the only 
{Catholic Church}outside{London.}The   
 priest who generally says the Mass at 
{Wardour}belongs to the{Jesuit}order.{ 
 The{Jesuits}have served in Wardour    
 since{1640}with only short breaks.    
 The congregation comes from up to{20  
 miles away to hear Mass.{150 to 200   
 people hear Mass in the{summer,}but   
 there are less people in the{winter.  
 People used to walk{5 miles}50 years  
 ago to get to Mass.Cars make it more  
 possible to get to church from farther
 away.There is one Mass on{Sunday,}and 
{three}during the week including the   
{children's Mass}on{Friday .
