		<content> Approximately one third of this area  
 is sea. The sand dunes are for ever   
 encroaching upon the Gwithian area.   
 These, the good beaches and surfing   
 encourage tourism and there are       
 several caravan parks. Unfortunatley  
 'Red River' runs into the sea from the
 mining area of Redruth/Camborne       
 between the beach and Churchtown Road.
 Gwithian is a quiet, picturesque      
 village. Whilst Connor Downs has      
 expanded residentially there has been 
 no industrial development and the     
 passing tourist has now been diverted 
 from the old A30 road onto the new    
 bypass to Penzance. Bed and breakfast 
 houses are said to have suffered.  The
 1981 census shows that Connor Downs   
 has 261 dwellings whilst Gwithian has 
 299, with an estimated population of  
 850 which increases in the holiday    
 seasons.                              </content>
