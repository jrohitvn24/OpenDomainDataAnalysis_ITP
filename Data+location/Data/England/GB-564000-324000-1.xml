 This is the main heart of the 2       
 villages of North Wootton and Castle  
 Rising which are divided by an area of
 woodland nown as Ling Common.         
 Castle Rising is dominated by the     
 Norman Castle and is a conservation   
 area with very limited housing        
 development.                          
 north Wootton is a village with large 
 private housing estates which have    
 developed since the late 1960's. Most 
 of the people living in the area      
 travel the short distance into the    
 town of Kings Lynn to work.  Both     
 villages have attractive centres with 
 a village green etc. Babingly in the  
 North east is a very small farming    
 community.
