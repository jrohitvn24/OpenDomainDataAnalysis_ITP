		<title>15Sheep Dipping</title>
		<content>   A mobile sheep dip was used for the 
 first time at Fieldlands this year. In
 previous years the sheep have been    
 taken to other farms to be dipped, but
 with an increase in the size of the   
 flock, it became worthwhile calling in
 the mobile dipping contractors.       
   Sheep dipping is required by law    
 twice a year as part of the Sheep Scab
 Eradication Scheme. It is a time-     
 consuming exercise with each animal   
 having to be immersed for 1 minute.   
   The farmer, Mr Corp, was pleased    
 with the method and pronounced it     
 quick and efficient. The sheep are now
 well and truly free from scab, and    
 so is the dog and probably all the    
 helpers too.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
