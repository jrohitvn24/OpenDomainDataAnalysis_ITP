		<title>15Land Ownership, and Sapiston</title>
		<content>Much land locally is owned by the Duke 
of Grafton, based at Euston Hall, a few
miles up the road. It is mainly        
farmland, with some residential        
property.                              
Much of the rest of the land is owned  
by the local charity, formerly the     
Churchwardens of the Parish. Some      
fields, allotments, and a playing field
are available for use.                 
                                       
The village of Sapiston is separated   
from Honington by the Black Bourn,     
over a narrow hump-backed bridge, with 
a new footbridge adjoining. Sapiston   
has mainly residential property with a 
village hall, used by residents of both
villages, for a youth club, Over 60s,  
and Women's Institute.
