		<title>08SCHOOL CLOSURES, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Following falling school rolls, the   
 closure of Aelfgar Comprehensive      
 School was announced in 1984 to take  
 effect from September, 1985. The first
 year pupils in 1985 were divided      
 between the 2 other secondary schools.
 After closure, Aelfgar will become a  
 sixth form college. The school playing
 fields were to be sold for housing but
 it seems that at least part is held in
 trust for recreational purposes. In   
 contrast, the Chancel Infants School  
 was to close in September 1984 but    
 following strong representations by   
 the parents' action committee up to   
 the Secretary of State for Education, 
 the closure proposal was withdrawn. If
 closed, there would be no primary     
 school in the older part of the town. 
 School closures are proposed in       
 neighbouring communities and school   
 catchment areas have been changed.    </content>
