		<title>17LINGCROFT POOL PLEALEY</title>
		<content> Lingcroft and the surrounding area has
 an abundance of wildlife.  On the     
 north-east side of the pool there is a
 squirrel's nest just next to a dam    
 which drains into a smaller pool,     
 which then drains off into a third    
 larger pool.  Altogether there are    
 three pools in the district of        
 Lingcroft.  The owner gives out       
 permits for fishing.Fish include      
 perch,rudd,tench and some carp.The    
 common frog and toad are also         
 abundant.  The pool seems to be quite 
 old, considering the surrounding      
 area.The north and south slopes have  
 been planted with spruce trees and the
 remainder of the vegetation is        
 natural. Birds seen come into three   
 groups:  feeding visitors, residents  
 and water fowl.  Of the plants there  
 are between 10 and 25 varieties of    
 trees, shrubs, flowers and grasses.   </content>
