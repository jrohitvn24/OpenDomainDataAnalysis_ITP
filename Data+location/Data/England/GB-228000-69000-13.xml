		<title>13Penharget Farm.</title>
		<content>{Penharget Farm}was mentioned in the   
 first Domesday Book. Then it had 30   
 acres with 1 plough, 3 cows, 2 pigs,  
 30 sheep and 6 goats. Six villagers   
 and their families lived there.       
 Today it is owned by Mr. David Tucker 
 as part of a family business with his 
 father and brother, who have another  
 farm just a few miles away. He has 252
{Longwool sheep}and 185 lambs which are
 kept for meat and wool. He has 136    
{Friesian cattle.}The steers go for    
 beef and the heifers for milking at   
 the other farm. Each year he cuts     
 grass for making{hay}and{silage}and he
 grows about 60 acres of{barley}for    
 feeding to his animals. He grows      
 several acres of{potatoes}which are   
 mostly sold to farmers in West        
 Cornwall for seed.                    
 Nowadays only three men work on the   
 farm.                                 </content>
