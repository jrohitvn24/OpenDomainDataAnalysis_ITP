		<title>15MARSHSIDE FARMING</title>
		<content> I live in Marshside and there are a   
 lot of dykes and there is thick mud   
 and the water is very deep. The banks 
 are slippery.  There are a lot of     
 farms and the farms have lots of      
 tractors on them.  There are a lot of 
 animals on the farms.  Soon they will 
 be baling the hay and also they will  
 cut the other fields.  Then they will 
 collect the bales.  They make silage  
 for the animals on the farm.  The corn
 is for making into flour for the bread
 then they sell it to the shops.
