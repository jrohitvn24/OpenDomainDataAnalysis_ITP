		<content> Most of the houses and farms in this  
 section are privately owned, some     
 farms have tied cottages for their    
 workers which go with the job. There  
 are 4 houses owned by the North       
 Wiltshire District Council and let,   
 they are at present being renovated   
 (09/85). All of the houses in this    
 section have mains water and          
 electricity but none have got gas     
 although some bottled gas is used for 
 cooking. The houses in Pavenhill have 
 mains drainage but the rest have to   
 rely on septic tanks. There is no     
 major building project planned, the   
 policy at present is to allow only    
 infilling of any spaces within the    
 Purton boundary.
