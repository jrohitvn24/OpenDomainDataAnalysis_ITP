		<title>16TOURISM IN BISHOPS FROME</title>
		<content> There are hardly any signs of real    
 tourists here. this is working, not   
 rambling, countryside, and in spite of
 breathtaking views to the Welsh hills 
 25 miles away, no fields are turned   
 over the caravans or campers, and 1   
 inn has accommodation. Footpaths are  
 hardly marked and often impassable,   
 and one cannot walk on the river      
 banks. Two features attract visitors: 
 Bishops Frome is known 40 miles away  
 for its pub with real ale, and the    
 church in Bishops Frome has a crusader
 tomb and family tombstones going back 
 to 17th century - the visitors book in
 the past year has signatures from     
 Spain, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
 USA and Malawi.
