		<title>10  Friars Court Farm</title>
		<content> This is a mixed farm of 550 acres to  
the south of Clanfield,the River Thames
forms the farm's southern boundary. The
imposing farmhouse has a moat on two   
sides and lies on the site of a        
building of the Knights Hospitallers.  
 The milking shed has recently been    
modernised and has herringbone shaped  
milking stalls.The corn store can hold 
650 tons, has a dryer, and a cleaner   
to remove weeds from corn sold for     
seed. As far as is known,this year,1985
the farmer was the first in England to 
install a solar powered system for     
grain drying. He is still experimenting
but already finds it more efficient    
than traditional methods.              
 To save both time and energy (fuel),  
this year the farmer installed a C.B.  
system to communicate between the farm 
office and the workers in the fields.
