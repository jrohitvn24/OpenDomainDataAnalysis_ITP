		<content>  Architecture in the area varies from 
 older,{terraced}properties having two 
 bedrooms and an{outside W.C.,}to      
 today's styles, mainly{semi-detached. 
 The latter almost always have garages 
 and in the main consist of 3 bedrooms,
 lounge, dining area and kitchen. All  
 are made from brick with tiled roofs. 
  The two types of property are to be  
 found side by side in many roads, such
 as{Granby Road}where the old gives way
 to the new within a few metres. Many  
 of the new windows are{double glazed  
 picture windows giving good views     
 rather than appearing attractive.     
  Most homes have{central heating      
 though a lot of the older properties  
 still have{coal fires.                
  Most modern houses have a garden,    
 front and rear, whereas the terraced  
 often have only a yard or small lawn  
 at the rear and no garden at the front</content>
