		<content> This is an area of gently undulating  
 land under cultivation.  it consists  
 roughly equally of good quality       
 grazing land and mixed crop growing.  
 Stock is mainly sheep, but there are  
 some beef and dairy cattle.  The land 
 apears to be farmed with respect for  
 conservation.  Dry stone walls are in 
 good condition, and well maintained   
 hedgerows and wind-breaks of large    
 deciduous trees provide habitat for   
 wildlie and give the area scenic      
 beauty.  Population is sparse and     
 amenities are few, consisting of pub, 
 chapel and village hall in the tiny   
 village of middleton.
