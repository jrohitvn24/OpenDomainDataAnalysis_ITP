 nine churches:- Unitarian, St. Paul's,
 St.Georges, Holy Trinity and and      
 Christ Church, St. Matthew's Mission, 
 St.Peter's, Methodist, Baptist and    
 Congregational. There is a great      
 variety of Christian churches, and    
 also groups of Muslims and Hindus.    
 At Holy Trinity C.E. the congregation 
 averages about 200, but can be more or
 less according to Special events.     
 There are two Services on Sunday, at  
 10.30 a.m. and at 6.30 p.m., and all  
 are different. Some are formal, some  
 informal, with guitars and            
 tambourines. In the middle of the     
 week, there is a Praise Service, and  
 an informal communion service, when   
 all sit in a circle and say their own 
 open prayers. For Young People there  
 is a Sunday School; Pathfinders, which
 is a Bible Class; CYFA, for teenagers </content>
