		<title>13COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content> Communications between the inner &amp;    
 outer areas of the villages concerned 
 are primarily by telephone which most 
 homes have.Vandalism has spelt the    
 demise of the public call box; the    
 only one remaining is in Hothfield &amp;  
 this one has had to be moved &amp; has    
 been threatened with complete removal 
 for economic reasons due very much to 
 vandalism.Private &amp; business people,  
 advertisers &amp; mail order catalogues   
 make good use of the postal services. 
 Free space is available in local      
 papers for area news &amp; events &amp; also  
 for items below Â£30.00.Free adverising
 papers are also delivered as are      
 others to order.Parish,church &amp;       
 village magazines/news-letters are    
 also informative.County,national,local
 &amp; citizens band radio &amp; television    
 bring local,national &amp; worldwide news.
