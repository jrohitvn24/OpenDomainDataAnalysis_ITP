St Catherine's Hospice first belonged  
 o the Dewhurst family,  who also owned
the cotton mill in Lostock Lane. In    
l92l they gave the house to Preston    
Royal Infirmary as a convalescent      
hospital.  It was opened in 1922.  In  
the out buildings they grew vegetables 
also kept pigs and hens.  The profits  
went to the hospital funds.  They also 
kept guinea pigs which were used in the
laboratory.  During the 1930s they held
a concert every Saturday night. In July
1948, the National Health Act was      
passed, and many years later it stopped
taking children till finally only      
ladies were accepted.  Dame Cecily     
Saund decided to buy the Hospice. Now  
eighteen personnel work there          
attending to the needs of terminally   
sick, twenty four in all.
