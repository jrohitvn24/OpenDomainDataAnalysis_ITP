There is an old lady who lives at Four 
Acres,Lower Weald, Calverton.She has   
lived there for 34 years. She is a     
widow of 75 years of age and her       
family have grown up and left          
home. She has decided to sell her house
because she finds it too difficult to  
cope with the large garden and the     
house.She is moving to an old peoples  
bungalow in Newport Pagnell.           
    There is a newcomer to the village 
she lives in Middle Weald Calverton.She
moved into her cottage 6 months ago.   
She use to live in Newport Pagnell a   
busy town with a lot of traffic and    
noise.She wanted to live in the        
country because it is quiet and        
peaceful and where there was open      
space for her to walk her dog and      
fresh air for her twin daughters.
