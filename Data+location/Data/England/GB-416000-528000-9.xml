		<title>09POLLARD'S MONSTER - 1</title>
		<content> Pollard's land (part of which is the  
 site of Barrington school) was aquired
 as the result of Pollard slaying a    
 'monstrous boar or serpent'.  In early
 times the hills and denes were thick  
 and dense with many wild animals.     
 Local people feared them and the      
 monster had killed several villagers  
 and knights. Both the King and the    
 Bishop offered rewards to get rid of  
 the 'dreadful monster'.               
    Pollard, the long looked for       
 champion, tracked the beast to its    
 lair in Etherly Dene and climbing a   
 large Beech tree waited, knowing that 
 the tree was its favorite delicacy.   
 After the Beast had gorged itself     
 Pollard mounted a fierce attack.  The 
 combat waged 'long and deadly' and the
 sun had set before he could sever the 
 beast's head.  He cut out the tongue  
 placed it in his wallet and slept.    </content>
