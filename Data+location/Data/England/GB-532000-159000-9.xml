		<title>09THE GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content> I like to play a game called French   
 Elastic. It is a good game. You get a 
 fairly long piece of elastic, you need
 3 or more people to play it. Two      
 people put their ankles in the        
 elastic. The other people have to get 
 inside the elastic and then put one   
 foot out and then both feet out. Then 
 you put the other foot in and then put
 both feet out. The aim is to get the  
 elastic as high up your body as       
 possible. If you touch the elastic    
 with your leg you are out. It is      
 exciting because you don't know if you
 are going to be out or not. We play it
 at school at playtime.
