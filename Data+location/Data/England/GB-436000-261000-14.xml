		<title>14The Ufton Flower Festival.</title>
		<content>                                       
  This festival takes place annually on
one day usually in early July.Private  
gardens and the church are open to the 
public.                                
  From the bottom of some of the       
gardens along the escarpment is a      
magnificient view of the surrounding   
countryside.A lot of flowers and       
vegetables are grown in the gardens.   
Some of the gardens have small         
aviaries in them.Also,a lot of trees   
are grown and the gardens are          
imacculately kept.Most of the gardens  
have paths in them but one particular  
garden has no proper paths but has     
worn down narrow tracks in the         
old cottage style.   Approximately two 
or three gardens have ponds.Older      
properties tend to have kitchen        
gardens whilst newer homes have a      
recreational function.                 </content>
