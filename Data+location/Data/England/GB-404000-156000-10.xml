 My dad works for Moffats in Devizes.He
 takes a van round the southern part of
 England .Not so far as Somerset and   
 Southampton .He sometimes goes to     
 Bristol .He goes round filling up     
 cigarette machines in small shops and 
 parks.He also takes the money out of  
 them and counts it up .He is usually  
 out of the house before I get up .He  
 takes his van into Devizes loads it up
 with cigarettes and then starts his   
 journey.He knows where to go because  
 he is given his route at the beging of
 the week .When my mum had a job she   
 worked at Moffats doing typeing .Now  
 she doesnt work there .But does some  
 house work on Wednesdays,Mondays,and  
 Fridays .At two houses in             
 Wedhampton.She goes about 9:00 am and 
 comes home about 1:00 pm.             </content>
