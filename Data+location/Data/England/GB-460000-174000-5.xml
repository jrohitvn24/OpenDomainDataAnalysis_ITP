		<content> and Westbury Farm measures 134 acres  
 divided into 72 acres for winter      
 wheat, 50 acres of winter barley and  
 12 acres of grass.                    
 There are 234 cows (Friesian/Holstein)
 and 2 bulls.  The average yield per   
 cow per year is 5440 litres of milk.  
 The young stock consists of 118 heifer
 calves, 30 limousin calves and 2      
 friesian steers kept due to illness as
 all friesian bull calves are normally 
 sold at 3 weeks old.  In winter the   
 cows are kept in a big barn consisting
 of cubicles capable of holding 200-300
 cows at a time.  The 9 employees on   
 the farm are: 1 manager, 1 secretary, 
 3 tractor drivers, 3 herdsmen and 1   
 calf rearer.                          
 The cows are fed on maize in winter;  
 it is made into silage in the same way
 as the grass.  The straw fed to the   
 cattle is treated with caustic soda in</content>
