		<title>06A LOCAL NET FACTORY</title>
		<content>    There are two small family-owned   
 net factories in Porthleven. One      
 belongs to Russell Cowls and his wife,
 who acts as secretary. The business   
 goes back four generations. His       
 machinery is obsolete dating from the 
 sixties, but cannot be replaced       
 because of the cost of new equipment. 
 There are three machines making square
 meshes. The diamond meshes have to be 
 made by several ladies upstairs who   
 pin the nets on the walls and use     
 wooden needles. The building is very  
 old. One of the walls is bolstered    
 with timber. The rooms are small and  
 narrow. Many different nets are made. 
 The main ones are fishing nets, which 
 are sent to Newlyn to be made into    
 trawl nets, cray fish nets, crab pot  
 nets, gardening nets and sports nets. 
 Occasionally nets are exported. Many  
 of his materials are imported.        </content>
