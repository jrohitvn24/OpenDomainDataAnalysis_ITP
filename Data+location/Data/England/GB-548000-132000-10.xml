		<content> This{area}is on Ashdown{Forest}which  
 includes common land 'owned by Lord   
 Buckhurst. Commoners still have a     
 right to the customary uses of the    
 forest reflecting{traditions}dating   
 from Saxon times. Commoners could     
 collect windfall wood but not trees   
 torn up by the roots as these belonged
 to the King. This timber could only be
 gathered between Hockday and          
 Michaelmas. Brushwood, furze and broom
 could be collected for fuel or burnt  
 to to create fresh pasture and it     
 became tradition to fire the gorse for
 this purpose in Spring. Stock could   
 graze on the forest except between    
 Michaelmas and Martinmas. Swine could 
 forage all year except during 'fence' 
 month., the fawning time of the{deer. 
 Commoners would put hay out for deer  
 in winter and claim a couple of beech 
 trees in return.                      </content>
