		<title>01REVIEW OF TYWARDREATH AREA</title>
		<content> Our area can be split into three      
 sections: the village of{Tywardreath} 
 itself, outlying scattered {farms}and 
 small groups of{housing}at Castle     
 Dore, Treesmill, Kilhallon and St.    
 Winnow.                               
 The name Tywardreath means{"House on  
{the Sand"}and the sea did once come as
 far as the village.{Daphne du Maurier}
 who lives near by used characters and 
 places from the area as part of her   
 book,"House on the Strand". The       
 village itself is situated on top of a
 hill overlooking St. Austell Bay and  
 has the mild,soft climate associated  
 with the south coast of Cornwall.     
 Although not in our area, it is       
 impossible to talk about the region   
 without mentioning the {China Clay    
 works around St. Austell and the Clay 
 Docks at the neighbouring village of  
 Par.                                  </content>
