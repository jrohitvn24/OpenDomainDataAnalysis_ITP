 D-BLOCK but there are two public      
 playing fields.Most people travel to  
 Yarborough sports centre and swimming 
 pool in Lincoln.A very popular pastime
 is bird-watching or walking.A lot of  
 people go cycling which is an         
 increasingly popular sport.Football is
 played on the playing field in        
 Langworth and is quite popular.Flower 
 arranging is enjoyed by old and young 
 alike.There is a 'Women's Institute'  
 group in Scothern and another meets at
 Langworth.The 'National Housewives    
 Register' mainly meets in             
 Sudbrooke.There are two Brownie packs 
 in our area but no Guides.Cubs and    
 Scouts have to travel to Nettleham to 
 meet at the Scout hut.The Scout
