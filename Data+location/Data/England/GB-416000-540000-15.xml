		<content> Last Tuesday we went to Aykley Heads  
 Police Headquarters it was a very     
 interesting visit. At l.3O p.m. we got
 on Mr Rayners bus and we arrived at   
 Aykley Heads at l.45 p.m. We had to   
 wait for P.C. Kinghorn to show us     
 around. First we went to the control  
 centre where they take messages and   
 send policeman to different places.   
 There is a large map of the motorway  
 in Co. Durham which shows where cars  
 have broken down. There are also six  
 computers. Next we went to see the    
 police cars and motor bikes, they use 
 Ford Grenadas, Rover, Honda motor-    
 cycles and Triumph Bonnevilles. Then  
 we went to the museum to see the old  
 police uniforms, also there were bits 
 of skulls and things from murders.    
 After this we waited for the bus and  
 got back to school at 4.3O p.m.
