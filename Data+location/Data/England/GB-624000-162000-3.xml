		<content> Apart from the{Alluvium}(marshes where
 the Wantsum Channel once ran) there   
 are two kinds of high ground in the   
 Stourmouth area. Firstly, the ground  
 at{Stourmouth}rises only a few feet   
 above the marsh, it is composed of    
 brickearth and gravel over chalk.     
 Although the rise in level is very    
 subtle it is made obvious by the      
 change in vegetation. There are large 
 trees and all flora is adapted to dry 
 conditions. Across the marsh to the   
 north is part of the{Isle of Thanet.  
 Here the Upper Chalk rises steeply    
 (over 20m in less than 500m) to become
 Downland. The soil is a rendsina and  
 very fertile, forming part what has   
 become know as Thanet's "cabbage      
 prairie". Fields on the marsh{flood}in
 the winter making Stourmouth appear an
 island.
