		<title>13Shopping patterns</title>
		<content> We asked at home about where most of  
 the shopping is done.This was divided 
 into 4 types of shopping;             
 1.The weekly or monthly groceries     
 2.Clothes,shoes,toys etc              
 3.Large items eg.furniture,T.V.,car   
 4.Casual shopping                     
 Most of the weekly shopping was done  
 in one of the nearby towns where there
 are supermarkets and cash and carry   
 facilities.Things in the second       
 section came from the same nearby     
 towns and also largely from the city  
 of Plymouth 20 miles away.The pattern 
 for the third section was the most    
 varied with Plymouth taking the most. 
 Local garages did well for cars and   
 two nearby discount stores near       
 Liskeard did well for furniture.Coads 
 Green Sub Post Office and shop was    
 only used for odd items that had been 
 forgotten because it was too dear.    </content>
