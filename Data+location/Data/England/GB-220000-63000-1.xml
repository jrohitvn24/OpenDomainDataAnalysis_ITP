		<content> DOBWALLS AND TREVELMOND ARE THE MAIN  
 AREAS OF SETTLEMENT IN A BLOCK THAT   
 LIES BENEATH THE BODMIN MOOR AND      
 BETWEEN LISKEARD AND THE GLYNN VALLEY.
 THE REST OF THE AREA IS SPARSELY      
 POPULATED.                            
  THE AREA IS SERVED BY THE A38(T) AND 
 THE PENZANCE TO PADDINGTON RAILWAY    
 LINE WITH A STATION AT LISKEARD.      
 MOST OF THE OTHER ROADS ARE MINOR.    
  PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS BLOCK DO A     
 VARIETY OF JOBS. AGRICULTURE IS THE   
 TRADITIONAL WORK OF THE AREA BUT WITH 
 CHANGES ON THE LAND HAVE COME CHANGES 
 IN THE WAY OF LIFE.                   
  THIS BLOCK IS NOT WELL SUPPLIED WITH 
 AMENITIES. RURAL AREAS HAVE ALWAYS HAD
 TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT.HOWEVER THE AREA
 IS CHANGING RAPIDLY AS ARE ITS NEEDS, 
 MAKING THIS AN INTERESTING PLACE IN   
 WHICH TO LIVE.                        
                                       </content>
