		<title>05Shakespeare at Wychnor Park</title>
		<content>Since 1983 Wychnor Park has seen open- 
air performances of three Shakespearian
comedies.  Behind the Hall, through the
rhododendron wood, there is a natural  
amphitheatre on a promontory over-     
looking the Trent and Swarbourne flood 
plain.  Dominating the clearing is an  
ancient giant oak, which acts as a     
focus and canopy for the acting area.  
Thickets on either side give cover for 
entries and exits.  Between them, the  
ground slopes gently up towards the    
wood; a space terraced for the         
performance with straw bales for an    
audience of 300.  Tall scaffolding     
towers house the lighting and the sound
crew.                                  
The first production was A MIDSUMMER   
NIGHT'S DREAM.  This was followed by   
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR and in 1985 
TWELFTH NIGHT.  The event is in aid of 
Alrewas Church funds.                  </content>
