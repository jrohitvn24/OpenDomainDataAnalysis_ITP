		<content>    Our class divided into 4 groups of 
 5 or 6 with an adult and each group   
 had 3 streets to examine.My group left
 school at 9.30.a.m. We carried a      
 board, a tally sheet for each street  
 and a list of reference numbers. We   
 took turns to mark off the use of     
 each building.We went through the     
 subway and saw the tiles marking the  
 line of the ancient City Ditch.       
   We looked at{Aubrey St.,Berrington  
{St.}and{Little Berrington St.}We saw  
 almshouses, hotels, shops, offices,   
 garages and carparks. We entered them 
 on the tally sheet and checked the    
 list for the number. It took an hour. 
 Then we walked up{Victoria St.}to look
 at the cannonball in the City wall.   
   Back at school we added the totals  
 for all the streets together to enter 
 them into the computer.
