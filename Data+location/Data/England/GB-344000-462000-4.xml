		<title>04P.C. Parkin 1.</title>
		<content> P.C.  George Parkin is a local        
 bobby. He lives in the area and is    
 well known to many of the children at 
 our school. Not because he has had to 
 arrest them but because he is a       
 friendly policeman. He came to our    
 school recently to tell us about his  
 job. He told us to call him George and
 said he had been a policeman for 20   
 years, thirteen of them in Morecambe. 
 He enjoys his work and although it is 
 sometimes dangerous he wouldn't want  
 to have a different job because it is 
 in the main interesting work. George  
 works different shifts and on the day 
 he came to see us he had started work 
 at ten past five in the morning.      
 Policemen must always be smart and at 
 5.30 they were inspected before going 
 out on patrol. They must also catch up
 with what happened the previous day.
