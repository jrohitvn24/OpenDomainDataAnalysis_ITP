		<content> A lot of our block is covered by      
 farmland.About an eighth of it belongs
 to Cattlegate Farm.Cattlegate's farm  
 buildings are not in our block, but   
 most of their land is. They have about
 320acres of wheat in our area.In June 
 Cattlegate open their strawberry      
 fields to the public,who pick their   
 own for purchase.A lot of farmland in 
 the area is grazing land for          
 cattle.The majority of the farms are  
 mixed. There are some beef rearers.On 
 Brook Farm where I live we keep cattle
 for beef and dairy products.In the    
 summer, my father,Mr. Thomas, takes   
 the 120 cows across the A121 to graze.
 Brook Farm has 230acres,about 40 of   
 which are grain.We also make a lot of 
 silage for winter.Nyn Manor Farm has a
 large herd of Charolais Cattle and    
 they also make a certain amount of hay
 for winter feed. by GARETH THOMAS.    </content>
