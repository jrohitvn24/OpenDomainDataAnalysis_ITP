		<title>02GAMEKEEPING IN HASELOR.WARKS</title>
		<content> We went to interveiw Mr.Steele about  
 gamekeeping. He said that has changed 
 a lot because now you have to train   
 but when Mr.Steele started he did not 
 have to train.He started as an        
 underkeeper(a deputy gamekeeper) who  
 just helps out.His busiest time of the
 year are the summer months.He has most
 poachers on Sunday morning and when he
 catches them he prosecutes them. He   
 does not work regular hours because if
 he did the poachers would know when to
 come.He enjoys rearing grey partridge 
 because they have a good temperament  
 and they're so natural. He rears about
 2000 pheasants a year. He says that on
 some Estates people shoot that number 
 a day. They do not shoot right through
 the year just October to February.His 
 greatest enemies are rats although    
 foxes are menaces. He catches rabbits 
 by netting,shooting,snaring or ferrets</content>
