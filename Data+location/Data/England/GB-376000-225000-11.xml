 anything to do with towns such as     
 urban studies.There are no ethnic     
 minorities at this school.There never 
 has been a child from another race    
 attending this school.

 scouts,women's institute,British      
 Legion,cricket and football teams,    
 tennis club,a playgroup,toddler group,
