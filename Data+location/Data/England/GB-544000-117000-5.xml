		<title>05Isfield Mill:Corn Merchants.</title>
		<content>   The Mill was{built}about 100 years  
 ago. Water power was used until 1904  
 when electricity was installed.{Animal
{food}is made from grains bought from  
 local farms. Fish &amp; soya bean meals   
 are also used &amp; Vitamins are added.   
 Dairy foods are mainly produced with  
 some for pig &amp; poultry. About{100 tons
 are produced each week.               
   They are sold to farms which could  
 be as far away as 25 miles. There are 
 2 bulk delivery lorries which also    
 collect corn from the farms.          
   In addition to food products{fertil-
{izer}is bought from a dealer in Horsh-
 ham to be sold to local farmers.      
   Ten full time workers are{employed}&amp;
 2 part time people. They come from the
 Uckfield area. In winter a few more   
 workers may be employed because the   
 demand for food is greater as many    
 animals have to be kept inside.       </content>
