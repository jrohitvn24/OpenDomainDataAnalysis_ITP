		<content> Approx one third of the total         
 population are in paid employment with
 an unusually high proportion (25%)    
 being employed in agriculture.There   
 are three working farms in the village
 of Kynnersley itself with two more    
 outlying farms in the parish.Over 70% 
 of the working population are employed
 in the tertiary sector with clerical  
 secretarial,retail and education      
 occupations being well represented.   
 In the village there is a plumbing    
 firm,a joiner and vehicle bodybuilder 
 and a nursing home.Many of the        
 workforce commute to work in nearby   
 Towns.Commuters travel by private     
 transport,over 80% by car as the bus  
 service only goes to Wellington and is
 too infrequent.Most agricultural      
 workers walk or cycle to work.A full  
 time Gamekeeper is employed by Eyton  
 Estates.                              </content>
