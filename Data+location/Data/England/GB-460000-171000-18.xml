		<title>18ENGLEFIELD HOUSE</title>
		<content> Englefield House is the largest       
 building in the sector. It has a late 
 Elizabethan E-plan and its three      
 storied facade has flint patternings. 
 Parts of the long gallery date to the 
 1550's, but much of the house and park
 which can still be seen were built in 
 about 1600. Further building work took
 place from the 1770's. The east front 
 has a Victorian ashlar-faced tower and
 a porch which is large enough to allow
 a coach and horse to enter. In the    
 1820's tall, square turrets, many of  
 them disguising chimney stacks, were  
 built. The front gates were built in  
 1862 to commemorate the marriage of   
 the owner, Richard Fellowes Benyon, to
 Elizabeth Clutterbuck and there have  
 been no radical additions or          
 alterations since. At present the     
 building is in an excellent state of  
 repair.                               </content>
