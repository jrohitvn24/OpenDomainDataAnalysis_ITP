		<title>07Wingate-V Bomber Crash 1971</title>
		<content>    On Friday January 8th 1971, Wingate
 suffered the{disaster that never was. 
 A Royal Air Force Vulcan bomber had   
 got into difficulties over            
 Northumberland and was attempting to  
 reach an airfield in Yorkshire.       
    The aircraft was first spotted by  
 children in the playground having     
 their morning break. They saw         
 parachutes leave the plane. Seconds   
 later the teacher on duty saw the     
 aircraft begin to dive. It was heading
 for the school. The roar of the       
 engines was fantastic. It was no more 
 than a couple of hundred feet up when 
 the nose lifted and the plane eased   
 away from the school and crashed about
 400 metres away from the school. It   
 appeared that someone had deliberately
 steered the aircraft away.            
    It crashed in a tiny field among   
 many houses. No-one was hurt.         </content>
