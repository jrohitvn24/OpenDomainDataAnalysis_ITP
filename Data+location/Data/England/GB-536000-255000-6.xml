		<content> Farming takes place in this area. "The
 Old Farm" Toft has 500 acres,mostly   
 used for wheat, the most profitable   
 crop to grow here.A fractional amount 
 of oil seed rape and maize are also   
 produced. There are 4 dogs and many   
 beef cattle and sheep. Machinery is   
 very expensive to buy and maintain.   
 E.g. a harvester costs Â£50 000 and a  
 crawler tractor is Â£36 000. There are 
 2 employees and 8 tractors.           
 "Highfield Farm" Comberton covers 82  
 acres. The farmer owns lots of        
 machinery.8 acres are taken up by the 
 campsite which holds upto 120 tents   
 and caravans. On average people stay  
 2_3 nights.They also own a shop       
 selling things from postcards to      
 ice_creams.The farmer gets up at 7.30 
 a.m. and spends his day working       
 extremely hard until 12.30 the next   
 morning.                              </content>
