		<content> Farming is the principal industry of  
 the area. Farm acreages range from 40 
 upwards, with field sizes from 5 to 50
 acres. Few farmers have contiguous    
 land boundaries, and some travel in   
 from neighbouring villages to reach   
 their land.                           
                                       
 Citizens band radio keeps isolated    
 households in touch with their        
 families working on the land. Farms   
 are well mechanised with tractors,    
 combines etc. Crops grown are wheat,  
 barley oats, sugar beet, potatoes,    
 carrots, feed beans, rape and a little
 maize. Only one farmer keeps cattle   
 and pigs, and there is no dairy       
 farming. Shooting interests vary from 
 the large landowner with gamekeeper to
 smallholds with rough shooting.
