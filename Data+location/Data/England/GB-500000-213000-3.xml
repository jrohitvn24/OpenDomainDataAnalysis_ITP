		<content> Studham Voluntary Controlled Lower    
 School was built in 1959 and extended 
 in 1969. The school is next to the    
 original building now a private       
 residence. Heating is by oil          
 and electricity as there is no gas in 
 the village. Facilities include an    
 open air swimming pool(unheated),     
 climbing frame(erected over a safety  
 surface), playground,greenhouse,2     
 aviaries,and an animal shelter. A pond
 provides scope for environmental work.
 The school serves Studham and         
 Whipsnade villages but accepts        
 children from further afield if there 
 are places available and their parents
 can transport them.The majority of    
 children travel to school by coach,   
 some by car and a few walk.           
 Children may start school as rising   
 5's and leave for Middle School at 9+.
