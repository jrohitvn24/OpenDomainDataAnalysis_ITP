		<title>16THE SAW-MILL</title>
		<content>   The Saw-mill in the Park has been a 
 commercial concern since 1930.  Seven 
 men are employed there to deal with   
 hard and soft wood from the 8,000     
 acres of near-by forest.              
   Hard wood, mainly oak, which thrives
 on the areas of London clay, is used  
 for making into fences, park benches  
 and garden furniture.  Some wood is   
 sold for rustic poles while other     
 large beams are in demand for         
 conserving and making reproduction    
 Tudor buildings.  Architects like the 
 "green" wood straight from the mill,  
 preferably with a fungus disease which
 will make the wood look black quickly.
 Mostly the mill sells planks of wood  
 to the general public.                
   Soft wood from the area of Bagshot  
 Sand is brought to the park from the  
 other saw-mill near Ascot for         
 treatment.                            </content>
