		<title>07 St Peters Church Gt Haseley</title>
		<content>  St Peters Church is the largest in   
the diocese apart from Dorchester      
Abbey.The tower is an important and    
predominent feature.It contains a      
bell-tower and a clock facing the      
village.It is said that the tower      
resembles a castle and that in olden   
times was a form of defence for the    
villagers.                             
  The church has a pipe organ that was 
installed last year (1984).The organ   
was purchased second hand and it came  
from a redundant chapel in Scotland.   
Years ago the church had an orchestra  
in the manner of village churches.The  
last instrument was stolen from the    
church recently.Similarly lead was     
removed from the roof by thieves,now   
replaced with copper sheet.            
  Holy Communion is celebrated each    
Sunday.
