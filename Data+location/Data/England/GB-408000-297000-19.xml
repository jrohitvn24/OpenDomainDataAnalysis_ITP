		<content> A report in the Sutton Coldfield News,
 May 1985 states that Four Oaks school 
 girl,Catherine Taylor,won a BMX       
 bicycle in a draw organised by the    
 British Rail's Railriders Club.The six
 year old scooped the prize when her   
 membership number was chosen from     
 thousands nationwide.The draw is made 
 every other month for members of the  
 club which is for young train         
 enthusiasts.Catherine has been a      
 member for fifteen months.Her interest
 in trains runs in the family according
 to her father,who is a great fan of   
 steam travel."We have been on the     
 Severn Valley Railway and some of the 
 narrow gauge railways in Wales,"said  
 Mr.Taylor,"a BMX has a lot of appeal  
 now she will spend her time rushing   
 around on that."Catherine was the envy
 of all her friends at Four Oaks First 
 School.                               </content>
