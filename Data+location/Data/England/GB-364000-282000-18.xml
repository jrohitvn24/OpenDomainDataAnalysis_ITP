		<content>{Clare &amp; I have lunch}(wholemeal cheese
 sandwiches soup &amp; yogurt), then I put 
 her to bed for a rest.I do some more  
 housework (eg. mopping floors) until  
 she wakes, about 3.00., but if the    
 weather is fine I spend this time in  
 the garden, weeding or cutting the    
 grass with our petrol mower. When     
 Clare wakes I change her nappy, give  
 her a drink &amp; play until 3.30 when    
{Michael comes home}to a cup of tea &amp; a
 biscuit. The children play &amp; watch TV 
 until their dinner at 5pm. Their      
 favourite is chips, sausage &amp; beans   
 followed by ice cream. Next I prepare 
 our evening meal,ready for my         
{husband's arrival}at 7.30, though this
 time may vary by an hour or more      
 depending on traffic &amp; his workload. I
 put the children to bed at 8.15 then  
 we talk, watch TV &amp; read before       
 retiring to bed at about 10.15p.m.    </content>
