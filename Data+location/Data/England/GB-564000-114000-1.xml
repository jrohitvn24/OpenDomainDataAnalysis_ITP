		<title>01A BRIEF INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Rural describes our area - 65 miles   
 from London and 15 miles north of     
 Eastbourne. Nearest market town is    
 Hailsham, 7 miles away.Our hamlets are
 Bodle Street or Bodle Street Green in 
 the west of the area, Ponts Green and 
 Brownbread Street in the east,part of 
 the straggling village of Ashbounham. 
 The main road pattern is from north to
 south.  The land rises and falls in   
 every directon and probably the thing 
 shared by every person here is a      
 splendid view over miles of open      
 country.                              
 In summer, everywhere you look there  
 are trees,not extensive woodlands, but
 thick hedges and clumps of trees      
 surrounding ponds and thin straggling 
 woods following the courses of the    
 steeply sided streams. The soil,mostly
 clay,but odd patches of sand and      
 sandstone.                            </content>
