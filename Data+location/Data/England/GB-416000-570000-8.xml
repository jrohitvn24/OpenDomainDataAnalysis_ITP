		<content>  When I was at the Sports Centre,a    
 man showed us around.His name was     
 Mr.Atkinson.The man said that they    
 play rugby,football and ride          
 horses.There is a shop where you can  
 buy shuttles,tenns balls and          
 rackets.The Sports Centre was opened  
 in 1967 and alterations were made in  
 1972.It is busy all year round rather 
 than now and again.We asked him what  
 the worst injury had been.He said that
 there had been broken limbs and       
 sprains.He said that in the future    
 they were wanting outside tennis      
 courts and 2,2 air rifle shooting. The
 prices are Â£6 for adults, Â£3 a child  
 to join for a year.They are open every
 day except Christmas Day.The man said 
 that volleyball is popular.The opening
 time of the sports centre is 9.00am   
 and the closing time is 11.00pm.
