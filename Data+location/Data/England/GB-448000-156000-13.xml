		<content> ALTHOUGH CURRENT USE OF CHEMICALS IN  
 FARMING HAS HAD A DRASTIC EFFECT ON   
 WILD LIFE OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES,  
 SCABIOUS ARE STILL FOUND ALONG THE    
 ROAD SIDES AND COWSLIPS HAVE RETURNED 
 DURING RECENT SUMMERS ON THE REMAINING
 GRASS AREAS OF DOWNLAND. THERE ARE    
 ALSO MARBLED WHITE BUTTERFLIES IN     
 THE WEST OF THE AREA. JUST BELOW      
 NUTHANGER FARM, TO THE NORTH, IS A    
 BADGER SETT TUCKED INTO THE WOODED    
 HILLSIDE. FOXES ARE HUNTED EVERY      
 WINTER, AND LAST WINTER DEER HAD TO BE
 CULLED BECAUSE OF DAMAGE TO TREES.    
 RABBITS ARE MORE PLENTIFUL THAN HARES.
 MANY FOOTPATHS ARE OVERGROWN AND MANY 
 HEDGEROWS ARE LOST; THE ELM HAS GONE  
 COMPLETELY (DUTCH ELM DISEASE) AND THE
 BEECH TREES ON WATERSHIP DOWN ARE     
 DYING. TREES ARE BEING PLANTED AGAIN  
 IN SOME PLACES.                       
                                       </content>
