		<title>12Employment</title>
		<content>The employment in this area of the Cots
olds is almost entirely based upon     
farming,there being no village         
communities with their associated shops
etc.Likewise there is no industry in   
this area and no office employment.    
 As one might expect,on the farms the  
employment is associated with milking, 
livestock keeping and general farmwork 
ie tractor driving etc.
