		<content> We went to visit 90 year old Mr.Alf   
 Fuller and his wife. He has lived all 
 his life in Newick, as did his father 
 and generations before him. Alf, his  
 father and his grandfather had all    
 been plumbers and their old plumbers  
 shop is at this moment being          
 re-erected at the Weald and Downland  
 Open Air Museum at Singleton. His     
 father installed the pump on the Green
 in 1897 to provide drinking water for 
 the villagers. Alf remembers the days 
 when they only had candles and oil    
 lamps for lighting, when cooking was  
 done on open'ranges' and when his wife
 drove the horse-driven milk float to  
 the creamery at Sheffield Park.       
 Mr Fuller's Aunt Elizabeth ran a      
 private school for boys and girls,    
 charging a shilling a week. She ran   
 the school single-handed and was also 
 Church organist for 50 years.         </content>
