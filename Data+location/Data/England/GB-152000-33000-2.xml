		<content>     {   St. Erth C.P. School}         
      The village school caters for    
 approximately 70 boys and girls (ages 
 4 to 11) from the village and         
 surrounds. The school comprises of    
 three teachers, with Mr.M.Garland as  
 Headteacher taking the older children.
      The school was built from granite
 stone from a now disused local quarry 
 in 1922 when the Church of England and
 Methodist Schools in the village      
 closed and the "new" school opened. At
 that time the school provided the     
 education for children aged 4 to 14 - 
 it was an "all age " school.          
      In the war it had evacuees from  
 Plymouth and London. In the mid-50s,  
 when all-age schools were being       
 replaced by separate Primary and      
 Secondary Schools, the school became  
 the Infant and Junior that it is      
 today.                                </content>
