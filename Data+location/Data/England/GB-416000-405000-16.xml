		<content> We asked people where they bought odd 
 items of food,their main food shopping
 ,clothes and large electrical goods.  
 Most people buy their odd items of    
 food in Holmfirth (5km away). Nearly  
 as many buy them from the village shop
 in Hepworth.A few people shop in      
 Jackson Bridge and Scholes. Most      
 people do their main food shopping    
 at supermarkets like Asda,Hillards    
 and Sainsburys in Huddersfield (11km  
 away)but some people go to Holmfirth. 
 Huddersfield is the main place where  
 people buy their clothes although some
 people buy them from Holmfirth.Quite a
 few people make their own clothes.Most
 people buy their electrical goods from
 electrical chain stores in            
 Huddersfield.A few buy them from      
 Holmfirth or Leeds (20km ).Some people
 find it easier and cheaper to shop at 
 the village shop.                     </content>
