		<content> Clevedon is situated in the hundred(a 
 subdivision of a county with its own  
 court)of Portbury.It is on the coast  
 of the Bristol Channel,in the County  
 of Avon,open to the Atlantic Ocean.   
 The name Clevedon is derived from     
 "Clivedone"...clive = cliff...and     
 done = valley.It was under this name  
 that it was mentioned in the Domesday 
 Book of 1086. The D_block which we    
 surveyed contained most of the old    
 part of Clevedon,from Hangstone Hill  
 to Walton St. Mary and East Clevedon. 
 We also included Walton_in_Gordano,   
 Walton Moor,Norton's Wood and Land    
 Yeo. The M5,a motorway of three lanes 
 each way,crosses the D_block.This has 
 been of crucial importance to the     
 development of Clevedon.There is now  
 easy (and quick) access to Bristol,and
 the M4,to the north.Clevedon is on the
 main holiday route to the south_west. </content>
