		<title>10A DAY AT SHREWTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The bell rang at 8.55 a.m. We lined up
 and then led into school. Mr. England 
 our teacher called the register, then 
 it was time for assembly in the hall. 
 Our first lesson was English, and I   
 wrote about our visit to H.M.S.       
 Victory at Portsmouth.  At break time 
 I had my bottle of milk, then went out
 to play in the playground.            
 The bell went and our class went into 
 the Library for our Maths lesson with 
 the Headmaster.                       
 At 12 O'clock it was lunch time. We   
 had roast pork, potatoes, cabbage and 
 carrots, followed by lemon meringue   
 pie.                                  
 At 1 O'clock back in our classroom, I 
 started my project and did some       
 drawings for my folder. After play it 
 was our Music lesson with Mrs. Annetts
 The school day finished at 3.10 p.m., 
 and I caught the school bus home.     </content>
