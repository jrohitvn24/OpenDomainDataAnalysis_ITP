		<content>    In order to help us write these    
 pages questionnaires were sent out to 
 the 48 houses in our 12 sq.km area. We
 received 32 of these back at school.  
                                       
    The most popular hobby by far was  
{gardening,}but as might be expected in
 such a beautiful area other outdoor   
 pursuits were well represented,       
 including{fishing, shooting, walking, 
{horse riding, beekeeping, sailing,    
{photography and studying wildlife. }  
                                       
    Indoor pastimes included{sewing,   
{reading, wine making and woodwork.}   
 There are several{folk musicians}     
 living locally who sing and play such 
 diverse instruments as accordian,     
 fiddle, mandoline, appalachian        
 dulcimer, penny whistle and several   
 guitars. There is a very popular folk 
 evening each Thursday at Oxen Park.   </content>
