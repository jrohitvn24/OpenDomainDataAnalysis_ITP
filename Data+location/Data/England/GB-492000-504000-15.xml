		<content> LOCAL BUSES. In Summer, four buses    
 from Whitby pass our School each      
 morning, calling at Robin Hoods Bay   
 shelter, Fylingthorpe Stores and      
 Fylingthorpe Old School on their way  
 to Scarborough. Another bus runs as   
 far as Fylingthorpe and returns to    
 Whitby.                               
 In the afternoon there are five more  
 buses. Altogether 20 buses go past our
 School.                               
 If you miss a bus you will have to    
 wait over two hours for another.      
 In Winter there are fewer buses from  
 Scarborough and Whitby.               
 You can catch a bus from Scarborough  
 to Malton and York and from Whitby to 
 Guisborough and Middlesbrough.        
 All the public transport in           
 Fylingdales and for miles around is   
 owned by the United Bus Company.
