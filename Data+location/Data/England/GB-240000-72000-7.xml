		<title>07The Brewery at Horsebridge</title>
		<content>   In 1480, a nunnery was converted in 
 to a{public house}called{The Black    
{Horse.}This later changed to The Pack 
 Horse Inn until the Civil War. Then   
 King Charles 1st visited the inn and  
 his seal remains in the front porch.  
 Since that time, it has been called   
{The Royal.}Locals, holiday-makers and 
 passers-by use the pub which{brews its
{own beer, the ingredients}coming in   
 the main,{from Ashburton,}Devon.{35   
{gallons}are brewed at a time and the  
 length of the fermentation process    
 depends on the strength of the brew,  
{approximately 4 days.}The brews are   
 known as the{Tamar, the Horsebridge   
{Best}and the{Heller.}The prices are   
 competitive with other name brands.   
 An extension of the brewery is planned
 for the future.
