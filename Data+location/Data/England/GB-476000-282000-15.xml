		<title>15The Village Fete</title>
		<content>The village fete was held on 22nd June 
in Mrs.Underwood's garden in the centre
of the village.It started with normal  
games and stalls including Groceries,  
Bottles,Raffle and the Wheel of        
Fortune.Later on Punch and Judy came   
and whilst this was happening some of  
our class was getting ready to do some 
Morris Dancing.After the Punch and Judy
had finished we did the Morris Dancing,
it all went well.After this I went to  
watch Tim Pepper in the stocks being   
soaked.I had two goes on the Lucky Dip 
and three goes on the Wheel of Fortune.
Earlier on we had the prizes for the   
pub sign competition.I came third and  
won 25p.Soon I had to go home and I had
enjoyed myself a lot.The money raised  
goes towards paying for things in the  
village.      Johnathan Gillespie.
