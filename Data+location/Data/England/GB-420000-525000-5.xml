		<title>05ALL SAINTS' SCHOOL FAIR</title>
		<content> On{11th July 1985}we had our{school}  
{fair.}There were all kinds of         
 stalls.There was a game in which you  
 had to pick out a whole egg from a    
 tray of sand with lots of hidden      
 broken egg shells.If you found the    
 whole egg you won Â£1.The other stalls 
 were selling toys, books, flowers,    
 plants,games,tins of food and         
 cakes.There was a raffle and one of   
 the prizes was a huge basket of fruit 
 given by{Geests}who are banana and    
 general fruit wholesalers based in    
 Shildon.The Police came to the Fair to
 show the police dogs and give a       
 display.One of the policemen put on a 
 leather arm protector and pretended   
 that he was a criminal.The police dog 
 chased him and bit through the        
 protector,piercing the policeman's arm
 with his teeth.We raised over{Â£250}for
 our{School Fund.}                     </content>
