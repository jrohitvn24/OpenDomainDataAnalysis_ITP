		<title>06 The Ambulance Station</title>
		<content>  We visited the ambulance station on  
 Birch St. and went in all sorts of    
 ambulances. We saw the equipment in   
 the ambulances. The station officer   
 said that the station was the Division
 headquarters and all the meetings take
 place there with some chiefs coming   
 from as far away as Glossop.          
                                       
 The station is the main repair place  
 for all the ambulances in the Division
 . There were 24 ambulances in from a  
 small four wheel drive Range Rover    
 they use on hills and narrow roads to 
 the big emergency ones they use at    
 motorway pile ups.
