		<title>14HISTORIC HOME MINCHINHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Rose Cottage, Amberley, is wrongly    
 thought to be the home of{Mrs. Craik} 
 who wrote{John Halifax, Gentleman}- a 
 novel published in 1856, which was    
 produced as a television series in    
 the 1970's. The true facts are        
 that years before her marriage to Mr  
 George Craik in 1864, Mrs.Craik, who  
 was then Miss Mulock, had stayed with 
 friends in the Stroud area - perhaps  
 at Rose Cottage. In the book she      
 describes Rose Cottage, and it is an  
 important house in the story. It was  
 where John Halifax spent some of his  
 early married life. He built up a     
 succesful weaving business at Dunkirk 
 Mills and finally died nearby.
