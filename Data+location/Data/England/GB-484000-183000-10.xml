		<title>10RIDING AT PINKNEY'S STABLES.</title>
		<content> My name is Rebecca Hall.  On Saturday 
 mornings I go riding at Pinkney's     
 Green Stables.                        
   When I get there the horses are just
 being groomed. Then they have to be   
 tacked up, that means putting on their
 saddles, harnesses and reins. We all  
 choose the pony that we want to ride, 
 and go up into the nearby woods. We   
 stay out for about an hour. While we  
 are out we make the ponies trot, jump,
 and do lots of different exercises.   
 When we get back to the stables, we   
 have to un-tack the ponies, and then  
 let them run in the field. They like  
 to have a drink and some hay.         
   There are 19 ponies at the stables, 
 which is owned by Meg Stanton. It     
 costs Â£3.50 per person to ride. Some  
 of my favourite ponies are: Smudge,   
 Jasper, Tammy and Banner.
