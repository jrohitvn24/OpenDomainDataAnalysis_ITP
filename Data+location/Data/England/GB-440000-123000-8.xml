		<title>08ALL SAINTS CHURCH HURSLEY</title>
		<content>    The Church of All Saints is an     
 attractive building with a traditional
 old spire.It stands in the church_yard
 which is full of,in spring,snowdrops, 
 crocuses and daffodils.               
   {The Reverend John Keble}who lived  
 in the 19th century and was one of    
 Hursley's most famous occupants,being 
 a good poet,is buried inn the         
 Churchyard.                           
    The present church is the third on 
 the site,following 12th century and   
 18th century buildings dating from    
 1884.The{tower}is original and        
 considering its age it is a very well 
 preserved building.The interior is    
 spacious,airy and dignified,and has   
 magic and romance which is partly why 
 the Church of All Saints appeals to so
 many people.
