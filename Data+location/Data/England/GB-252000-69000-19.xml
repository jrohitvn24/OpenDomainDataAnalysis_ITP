		<content> There are not many{jobs}in this area, 
 except for jobs serving other people, 
 such as postmen, small shopkeepers, a 
 Citroen garage in Walkhampton and a   
 Morris Minor specialty garage on the  
 B3121 between the railway line and    
 Dousland. The garages probably cater  
 for people who drive into the area.   
  Most people{commute}to work          
 elsewhere, especially Tavistock and   
 Plymouth. Children over 11 commute to 
 Tavistock Comprehensive School.       
  Very few people travel in to work in 
 this area - some teachers and pupils  
 at Walkhampton School - and the{vicar.
 He is also the vicar of Meavy and runs
 both churches. He lives at Meavy. Some
 work is provided by the{Forestry   }  
 Commission and{SWWA}around Burrator.  
  Some people commute through the area 
 -eg. teachers and prison officers     
 travelling to Princetown.             </content>
