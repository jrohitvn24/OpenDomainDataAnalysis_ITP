		<content> Those still active in Estate work and 
 those whose lives were spent in its   
 service, make up the bulk of the      
 population, about 400. As in most     
 villages there is a proportion of     
 retired people. In order to keep the  
 vitality of the village it is policy  
 to let homes to families with young   
 children, so there is a better age mix
 than in many such communities.        
 People from all walks of life and from
 different parts of the country have   
 settled here furing the past twenty   
 years and the commuting population is 
 growing.  Although a close community, 
 newcomers are readily accepted.
