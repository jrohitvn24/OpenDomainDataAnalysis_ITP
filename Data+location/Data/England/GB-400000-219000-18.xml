		<content>   Andoversford school is in the       
 village along the Old Gloucester      
 Road.It was built fifty years ago in  
 1933.There are 150 pupils who live in 
 surrounding areas.There are four full 
 time teachers and one part time       
 teacher.                              
   Many of the pupils at the school did
 not mind going because they can see   
 their friends at playtime.In the games
 lessons thet also have a lot of       
 freedom.                              
   Even though the school is in the    
 country the pupils do not do much work
 outside.                              
   The pupils thought that there were  
 many advantages of the school because 
 it is nearer and smaller but with a   
 large play area.
