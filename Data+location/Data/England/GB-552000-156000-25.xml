<title>25Farming in Kemsing</title>
<content>

In our area the predominant agricultural land use is pastureland and rapeseed, with very small areas grain crops and no commercial orchards. &lt;br />&lt;br />The grazing areas are of rough pasture in fields which vary in size from approximately 750sq.m. to 2000sq.m.  This is permanent grassland used on a rotational basis with neighbouring fields for sheep (mainly crossbreeds, rather than Kents) and horses. &lt;br />&lt;br />These fields are largely separated by hedges of hawthorn, hazel and oak, with blackberry, dog-rose and convolvulus mingling amongst them, though barbed wire fences thread through the hedges to close gaps where the original hedge has died. &lt;br />&lt;br />The orchards in this area are small patches of apple orchard, and any fields of grain crops are very small.   &lt;br /> &lt;br />
