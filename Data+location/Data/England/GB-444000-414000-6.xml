 TRANSPORT IN THORPE AUDLIN            
  Thorpe Audlin is a very small village
 therefore,it does not have much public
 transport.The village has transport   
 from the Metro and also the South     
 Yokshire Bus Company.                 
  The Metro service has a bus running  
 from Pontefract to Barnsley which on  
 its route, passes through Thorpe      
 Audlin and many other villages.       
  The South Yorkshire Service has a bus
 which runs from Leeds to Doncaster.The
 bus does not pass through the middle  
 of Thorpe Audlin but travels on the   
 outskirts of the village.             
  To travel by any other means of      
 transport such as air or rail, people 
 from Thorpe Audlin must travel first  
 to bigger towns with these facilities.
