		<title>10HISTORY-KILMERSDON-CHARLTON</title>
		<content> "Chenemersdone" in the Domesday book  
 l086. The word meant "mere-stone" or  
 boundary. Kilmersdon in the l9C - The 
 Barracks - Built in l800, is now      
 converted into three dwellings.       
 Originally a workhouse and got its    
 name when troops were quartered there 
 during the Napoleonic Wars. On the 3rd
 floor the pauper children were taught 
 to weave. The blind house - a square, 
 stone, windowless little building with
 a stone conical roof. Once a lock-up, 
 it is now used as a bus shelter.      
 "White Gates" - Charlton. A           
 mid-Victorian gate-screen, of         
 classical Greek style, once formed the
 entrance to Charlton House, a Jolliffe
 residence demolished c. l950.         
 A detailed survey of the manor of     
 Kilmersdon was made in 1571 (reference
 should be made to this in studying the
 history of Kilmersdon).               </content>
