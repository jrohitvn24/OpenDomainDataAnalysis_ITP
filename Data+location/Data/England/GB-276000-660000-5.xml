		<content>  The second of the two farms which we 
 looked at in Chapelhall was Gartness, 
 with 15 acres which were all owned.   
                                       
  Gartness did not really operate as a 
 farm more as a hobby. The people who  
 owned it had other means of           
 employment.                           
                                       
 Nevertheless the farm was arable and  
 most of the land was rented out for   
 growing grass for silage.             
                                       
  The type of soil was clay and the    
 farm employed no workers.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
