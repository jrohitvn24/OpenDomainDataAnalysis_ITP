		<content> CHILDREN'S HOBBIES WEST WIGHT         
                                       
 My hobbies in the 1980's              
                                       
 My first hobbie is cooking because you
 can get your family to eat it with    
 you.  My next hobbie is reading       
 because when you read a story you feel
 like you are in the story.  I choose  
 books from my school library which is 
 quite good.  My next hobbie is looking
 after my cat.  I comb my cat, feed my 
 cat and cuddle my cat, too.  Cats are 
 very clever like my cat sits on my    
 dads lap and he pulls his glasses off.
 My cat eats like a dog it must be very
 hungry.  My next hobbie is bike riding
 every night I go for a bike ride, its 
 very interesting going past all the   
 houses and trees.  Sometimes it can be
 boring but normally it is fun.        
 Unfortunately it has a puncture.      </content>
