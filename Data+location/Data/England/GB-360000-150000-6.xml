		<content> The 700 year old church is now        
 redundant but a service was held there
 on Palm Sunday in 1985.  The          
 Churchyard is still used for burials. 
 In the floor of the sanctuary there is
 a stone memorial to two small children
 who died in 1700 bearing the words:   
 "Thee pretty babes for long did play  
 before the Lord called them away."    
 There is also in the same floor a     
 memorial to three small children of   
 one family who died a few years later.
  The Font is Norman and there is a    
 gallery at the West end supported on  
 oak pillars.  Extensive views fo the  
 surrounding countryside can be enjoyed
 from the North doorway of the Church.
