		<content> A small proportion of the village     
 people use the local bus service.     
 This leaves the village at 9.45am and 
 returnes 12.45pm on Wednesday and     
 Saturday.  This means just 2 hours    
 shopping time in Dorchester and many  
 find that it is inadequate for their  
 needs.  It is a regret that there are 
 no evening buses.  Most people would  
 like transport to Dorchester, half as 
 many to Yeovil and others to Maiden   
 Newton.                               
 Transport is needed for shopping,     
 entertainment, work and evening       
 classes.  The majority off households 
 have a car and there is a high number 
 of 2 car families.  Nearly half of the
 households of the village  have no car
 available  during the working day.    
 Many people feel that a community     
 minibus would be nan asset to the     
 village.                              </content>
