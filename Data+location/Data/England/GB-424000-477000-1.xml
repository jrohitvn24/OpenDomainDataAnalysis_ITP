		<content> THE VILLAGE OF WEST TANFIELD IS       
 SITUATED ON THE NORTH BANK OF THE     
 RIVER URE, SIX MILES FROM THE CITY OF 
 RIPON ON THE A6108.  THE VILLAGE HAS  
 GROWN UP ON THE HIGHER GROUND ABOVE   
 THE RIVER URE WHICH OCCASIONALLY      
 FLOODED THE SURROUNDING LAND.  THE    
 VILLAGE IS APPROACHED FROM THE SOUTH  
 ACROSS A GRACEFUL THREE ARCHED STONE  
 BRIDGE.  THE AREA IS BASICALLY        
 AGRICULTURAL, A LARGE PROPORTION OF   
 THE LAND GIVEN OVER TO ARABLE         
 CULTIVATION, THE MAIN CROPS BEING     
 BARLEY, WHEAT AND POTATOES.  FORAGE   
 CROPS OF HAY AND SILAGE ARE GROWN IN  
 EARLY SUMMER FOR THE WINTERING OF     
 SHEEP, DAIRY COWS AND FAT CATTLE.  THE
 AREA WAS HEAVILY GLACIATED IN THE ICE 
 AGE AND THIS HAS RESULTED IN GOOD     
 DEPOSITS OF GRAVEL WHICH IS NOW       
 QUARRIED FOR INDUSTRIAL USE.
