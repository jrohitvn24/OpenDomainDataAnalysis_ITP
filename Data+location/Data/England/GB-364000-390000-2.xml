 pitches and changing rooms.The High   
 School has an excellent range of      
 indoor and outdoor sports facilities  
 as well as rooms in the school and    
 library available for community use.  
 Some facilities are only available out

 community rooms are available during  
 the school day.Community rooms are    
 mainly used for old peoples groups and
