		<title>07RIDGEWAY PATH, RISBOROUGH</title>
		<content>There are several ancient trackways in 
this area, the upper &amp; lower icknield  
ways being the best known. In place    
they are still just footpaths and      
bridleway, but like many other ancient 
tracks, in parts they have become      
modernh highways.                      
Several years ago, sketches of the     
upper icknield way and other lenghs    
of footpaths in the area become part of
the ridgeway path, one of the modern   
long distance footpaths in britain. It 
runs from Ivinghoe Beacon in the east  
of the county of Aylesbury in          
Wiltshire. As its name implies, it     
follows the ridge of the Chilterns and 
other chalk downlands for much of the  
length. However it is foced to come    
down from its ridge to cross the many  
gaps which were probably breached in   
the Chilterns by meltwater at the end  
of the last ice age.                   </content>
