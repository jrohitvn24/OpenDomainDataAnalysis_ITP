		<title>11Employment in Normanby</title>
		<content> In Normanby more than half the        
 population are either involved in full
 time or part time employment.In the   
 village only one person is not        
 employed who would like to be.15      
 people travel to work by car,2 by bus,
 2 walk,1 by motor cycle,1 cycled and 1
 person said he travelled by various   
 kinds of transport.The average daily  
 mileage for travelling to work from   
 Normanby is 10 miles.17 people travel 
 0-5 miles,12 travel 6-15 miles and    
 just 2 people travel over 15 miles.The
 reason that some people only travel   
 0-5 miles is probably because a lot of
 them might work on the estate.The     
 total population of Normanby is 58    
 people 3 of whom are retired.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
