 Papercourt Farm has 200 acres of land 
 mostly consisting of water meadows.   
 Cattle graze on this land and         
 occasionally hay and silage are made  
 on the drier fields. There are 10000  
 laying hens and 5000 rearing pullets  
 all houses in battery cages. When hens
 are 76 weeksold they are sent for     
 slaughter. Little is known about the  
 history of the farm, but the present  
 farmers have been there for 28 years.
