 The Church of St.James, Brassington is
 built of stone.    The tower, with its
 unique feature of two buttresses on   
 the South side, parts of the porch and
 the South aisle are all Norman; so it 
 the font.                             
 Inside the West wall of the tower is  
 "the oldest inhabitant"of Brassington;
 this is a stone about 30x20cms., built
 into the wall, on which is carved in  
 high relief the 3/4 naked figure of a 
 man with his hand on his heart.   This
 is thought to be older than the tower 
 itself.                               
 Marble from Ashford-in-the-Water was  
 used for the column of the Arches     
 between the nave and the new North    
 aisle which was added in the 19th     
 Century. The chancel, parts of which  
 are decorated 14th century work, was  
 lengthened.                           </content>
