		<content> From January to March all mechanical  
 and outside repair work is completed. 
 Middle of March the sheep commence    
 lambing which necessitates attention  
 day and night for some weeks.The      
 arable crops are sprayed to deter     
 weeds or with fertiliser.             
 Early June the grass is made into     
 silage and stacked in clamps closely  
 followed by haymaking which is        
 stacked in barns. There are many      
 intermittent tasks to be fitted in    
 with seasonal work, sheep are shorn,  
 dipped, followed by lambing, weaning, 
 and sale. Ground is prepared and      
 planted with kale for winter forage.  
 In July winter barley is ready for    
 harvesting, cereal harvest is         
 completed by September, ploughing and 
 reseeding follows. September cows     
 commence calving. The autumn brings   
 the culling of all stock.             </content>
