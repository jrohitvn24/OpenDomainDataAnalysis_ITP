		<title>14the Graveyard</title>
		<content> This is a simple one, walled in with  
 the church, and by an overgrown tarn  
 which must have been full of water    
 flowers in the summer. The gravestones
 are simple in design and the newest   
 one made of slate is very similar in  
 design to the rest beside it. Some    
 graves are just mounds but it is a    
 cared for place and well kept, with   
 clear and well painted noticeboard. It
 is quoted in a newly published        
 Bartholomews Guide as an attractive   
 church "because of its tranquility    
 rather than its antiquity". there are 
 names of folk from many countries in  
 the church book, so it would appear   
 that it si well known in church and   
 tourist circles.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
