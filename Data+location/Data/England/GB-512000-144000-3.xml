 This block is within commuting        
 distance of London yet is             
 unspoilt,quiet and beautiful, and is  
 largely occupied by the moderately    
 wealthy, as agricultural labour has   
 been superseded by the machine.       
 Only three working farms now exist.   
 Farm houses and cottages are now      
 homes for professional or retired     
 people.                               
                                       
 Approximately 90% of homes are        
 owner-occupied, and of the l00 - 200  
 year old cottage style, partly built  
 of local sandstone and brick, with    
 tile hanging, well modernised with    
 lovingly tended gardens.  Some l0%    
 of owner-occupied homes are large     
 enough to require domestic staff.     
 There is little new building (post
