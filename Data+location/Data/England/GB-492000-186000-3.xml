		<title>03DROPMORE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Dropmore School occupies a building   
 dating back to the 17th century when  
 the Fortesque family owned it.They    
 opened the school for the children of 
 their gardener(he had 13              
 children).Since then two more         
 buildings have been added one in      
 Victorian times and the other in the  
 early seventies.                      
 The school log books go back quite    
 some time.Some of these extracts tell 
 us how many children attended school  
 at various times.For example in 1874  
 fifty-six children were at school.The 
 school achieved its highest roll      
 during the second world war due mainly
 to evacuees from London.
