		<content> When you leave Matlock on the         
 Chesterfield road, you pass a large   
 forest.This is called Matlock         
 Forest.The trees are planted very     
 close together but every now and then 
 a wide pathway runs between them.     
 The pathway is called a ride and it   
 would help to stop forest fires if    
 they broke out.                       
 In the middle of the forest there are 
 many coniferous trees like pine and   
 spruce but round the edges some       
 deciduous trees have been planted to  
 protect the other trees.              
 When the trees are fully grown they   
 will be cut down and made into        
 telegraph poles and fences.I take my  
 dog, Bob, for a walk in the forest.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
