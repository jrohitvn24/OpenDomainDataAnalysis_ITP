		<title>12A Manor House in Jersey</title>
		<content>      Trinity Manor was bought in 1909 
 by the present Seigneur's family. The 
 family undertook extensive            
 alterations, the style of the         
 buildings becoming more French than   
 English.                              
      The grounds of the manor are     
 extensive. They include a working farm
 which grows crops such as potatoes and
 daffodils as well as having fields for
 grazing.                              
      The manor is the home of the only
 pack of hunting hounds in the island. 
 They formerly used to hunt real prey  
 such as foxes, but have long since    
 followed a false trail. The present   
 Seigneur is the Master of the Hunt.   
      The position of the Seigneur     
 nowadays is very different from       
 ancient times. The Seigneur has no    
 power over the local people and can   
 expect no dues.                       </content>
