		<title>12Life of an Eckington person.</title>
		<content> Mrs. Gill told us that there weren't  
 many girls in Eckington between 1945  
 and 1955. Everyone was glad  when a   
 baby girl was born. The main jobs in  
 1950 were filling trucks with coal,   
 working on the land and working on the
 railways. The roads weren't busy, but 
 train travel was cheap so it was very 
 busy. The shops in Eckington were The 
 Corner shop, Post Office and The Well.
 The Bell, Crown and Anchor were, and  
 still are, the pubs. The hot water was
 put in in 1955. The villagers kept    
 cats, pigs and chickens. The cats     
 stopped the rats and mice getting to  
 the corn, which was fed to the other  
 animals. Sometimes the floods in      
 Eckington came right up to Boon       
 street, and "Once the flood was about 
 2ft deep outside my house" Mrs. Gill  
 said. Villagers made lots of Home-made
 wines like plum and damson wine.      </content>
