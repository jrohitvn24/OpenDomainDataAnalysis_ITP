		<title>13SHEEP SHEARING,Yeoford.</title>
		<content> At{Shortacombe Farm}we went to watch  
 the sheep shearing.We got the sheep in
 early ready for the sheep shearer, we 
 put the sheep into a bullock shed.We  
 put some sheep into a separate pen and
 they were the ones that were going to 
 be sheared first. The farmer and his  
 brother took it in turns to catch the 
 sheep for the sheep shearer who lives 
 at{Woodland Head.}When they caught the
 sheep,he held the sheep by its knees. 
 He started from the tummy and worked  
 from there downwards, he then did the 
 sheep's legs, then he did one of the  
 sheep's sides, then the back and other
 side.It was then marked with a "C" for
 the farmer. All the fleeces were      
 rolled up and put in a pile and then  
 when there was time the fleeces would 
 be taken to the wool factory in North 
 Tawton. We then took the sheep back to
 the field.                            </content>
