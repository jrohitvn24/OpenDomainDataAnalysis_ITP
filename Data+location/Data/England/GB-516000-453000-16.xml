		<title>16OUR SCHOOL TRIP  1985</title>
		<content>  On July 11th, we went on a class trip
 to Pickering.When we reached Pickering
 we split up into two groups. 15 of the
 older pupils went with Mr Nettleship  
 to a Museum at Hutton Le Hole.The     
 museum was full of interesting objects
 which showed what it was like to live 
 in a country village about 100 years  
 ago.After that,the group went up to   
 the forest.Some went pony trekking    
 there whilst the better riders went on
 to ride in Pickering.While all this   
 was going on,the other children were  
 travelling by train from Pickering to 
 Grosmont.After eating their lunch and 
 having a paddle in a stream,the       
 children had a look around Grosmont.  
 The return trip to Pickering was on a 
 steam train.At 2.30 the groups met    
 together again to drive by coach to   
 Scarboro'.All the pupils went to the  
 Swimming Pool then we went home.      </content>
