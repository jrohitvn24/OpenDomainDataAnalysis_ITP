Adbaston School opened in 1843. It is  
now administered by Staffordshire      
County Council.  It has 2 full-time    
teachers; 1 part-time peripatetic music
teacher and an ancillary lady. This    
lady supervises the children daily     
during the lunch hour. 19 of 30 pupils 
bring their own lunch, the remainder   
have school dinners (1 pupil receives  
a free school meal).                   
Of the 30 pupils there are 21 boys and 
9 girls, all white.  Most leave to     
attend Eccleshall Middle School        
although some do go to Private Schools.
There are 2 classes in separate rooms; 
5 to 6.5 yrs. and 6.5 to 9 yrs.        
The catchment area is that part of     
Adbaston parish outside Shropshire,    
also the villages of Shebdon and Doley.
