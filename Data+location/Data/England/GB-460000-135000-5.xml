		<content> The increased accessability by road   
 today has had two main effects.  House
 property has increased greatly in     
 value, often beyond the means of local
 people to rent or buy, and is sold    
 largly to developers or "newcomers"   
 who work at a distance.               
 The growth of buit-up arears, New     
 Towns etc. have forced up the price of
 good agriculturial land from its 1946 
 price of Â£100 an acre in Hampshire to 
 between Â£1,800 and Â£2,500.            
 The new generation of villagers must  
 now find work in nearby towns, and    
 small village schools have closed and 
 must send their children elsewhere by 
 bus. These changes have also brought  
 great improvements in sanitation and  
 living conditions to country people   
 and far wider opportunitiefor sport,  
 education and social life.
