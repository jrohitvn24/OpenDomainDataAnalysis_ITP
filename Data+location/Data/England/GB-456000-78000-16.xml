		<content>{The Landslip}is between{Shanklin}and{ 
{Bonchurch.}It is near a place called  
{Luccombe}.It is very hilly.There is   
 are places called{Devils Chimney,     
{Criss-cross cottage}and there is a    
{castle.}You can see for a long        
 way out to sea.{Devils Chimney}is a   
 big rock that has split over the      
 years.  Some men put some steps in it,
 and it is very steep and narrow. The  
 walls were very crumbly. It is stony  
 and very damp and there are bars to   
 hold on to.There are lots of trees and
 there are ivy bushs,sycamore and holly
 and twigs and blue-bells elder, fern, 
 nettles and hawthorn and cow-parsley. 
 It is called the{Landslip}because the 
 whole area is slowly slipping         
 downwards into the sea,it is          
 constantly on the move.
