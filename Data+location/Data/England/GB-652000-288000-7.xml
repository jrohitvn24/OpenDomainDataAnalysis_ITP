		<content>To the east of the holiday camp is a   
cleft in the cliff at G.R. 537 885     
known locally as 'Crazy Mary's Hole'.  
Mary was a love-sick girl who gave her 
heart to a sailor. He never returned   
from sea and she spent her short life  
pining on the sea shore. Eventually    
she died and her body was found on the 
beach. The story is told in            
{'Folktales and Legends of Suffolk'}   
by G. M. Dixon, (Minimax Books).       
On nearby Bloodmoor Hill at G.R. 520   
895 it is said that a fierce {battle}  
was fought between the Romano-British  
settlers and the invading Saxons.      
Implements, coins and a few remains of 
horse harness from the period have been
discovered at the site. This is        
recorded in 'Flinten History' by Rev.  
Canon Stather-Hunt.
