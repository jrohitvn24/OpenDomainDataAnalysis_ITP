		<content> THE VILLAGE OF BATTLE CONTAINS A LOT  
 OF{SHOPS}WHICH ARE USED MAINLY BY     
 LOCAL PEOPLE RATHER THAN TOURISTS.    
 MOST OF THE FOOD SHOPS ARE LOCATED ON 
 THE HIGH STREET. THESE INCLUDE A SMALL
 SUPERMARKET, A BAKERS, SEVERAL        
 BUTCHERS AND GREENGROCERS, AND A      
 DELICATESSEN. THERE IS NOT A GREAT    
 DEAL OF COMPETITION BETWEEN THE SHOPS 
 SO PRICES TEND TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER  
 THAN IN LARGE SUPERMARKETS. MOST OF   
 THE SHOPKEEPERS HAVE THEIR REGULAR    
 CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE SHOPPED THERE FOR  
 YEARS AND WHOM THEY KNOW BY NAME.MANY 
 SHOPPERS TOLD US THAT THEY DID NOT    
 MIND THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICES       
 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE THE BUSY    
 SHOPS IN HASTINGS, RESENTED           
 TRAVELLING, AND FOUND BATTLE          
 SHOPKEEPERS TRUSTWORTHY AND RELIABLE.
