		<content> The main noticeable change in home    
 life over the past 20 years is that   
 both husband and wife now go out to   
 work when work is available. This     
 places far more responsibility on the 
 children in the home. In our survey it
 was found that 30% of parents had left
 home for work before the children in  
 the morning and 20% of the children   
 went home to an empty house or to     
 neighbours in the evening. Traditional
 eating habits are still maintained    
 i.e. good breakfast, packed lunch for 
 all the family, dinner at night.      
 Convenience foods are now widely used 
 and well liked by the children. Every 
 home has a television and half have   
 access to a video recorder. In lots of
 homes continental quilts have replaced
 sheets and blankets. Most homes now   
 have an automatic washing machine,    
 fridge &amp; freezer, 25% have a microwave</content>
