		<title>04THE SHOP IN L. STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> The General Store and {Post Office}is 
 on the road which runs through Little 
 Staughton. It has a wide range of     
 groceries and bread. It sells a good  
 selection of fresh vegetables and     
 fruit some of which are grown         
 locally.It is also licensed to sell   
 alcohol.Newspapers and magazines are  
 sold and there is a noticeboard for   
 people to advertise goods for sale.The
 store has been modernised recently.The
{Post Office}is very important in a    
 village because people can buy stamps 
 and post their letters and parcels    
 locally. State benefits are also paid 
 out at the Post Office. The older     
 villagers cannot always get to the    
 shop in bad weather so the shopkeeper 
 delivers orders to their homes.There  
 is a dry cleaning and shoe repair     
 service. The{Parish Council           
{noticeboard}is outside the shop.      </content>
