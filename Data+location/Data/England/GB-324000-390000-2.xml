		<content>   Cadbury's in Moreton opened in 1953,
 just after the 2nd World War because  
 they thought that after rationing     
 everyone would want sweets. They have 
 three different factories on the site 
 :- tea, Smash (instant potato),       
 chocolate biscuits and cakes.         
   They employ 2500 people, but the    
 amount rises in summer to make things 
 ready for Christmas, making 5 million 
 chocolate fingers a day. 60% of the   
 workforce are women, and they make    
 better packers, having nimble fingers.
   The potatoes come from America and  
 Holland, cocoa from Africa, tea from  
 Sri Lanka and India. Security is      
 difficult because many people use the 
 sports facilities at weekends. They   
 plan to build a high fence and have   
 video cameras.The site covers 70 acres
 and is almost a metre below sea level.
 Sea breezes helps set the chocolate.  </content>
