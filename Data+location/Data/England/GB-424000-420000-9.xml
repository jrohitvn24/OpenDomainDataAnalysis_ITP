		<content> My name is Richard and I go to        
 Chickenley Middle School Dewsbury,    
 which starts at 8.55am and and closes 
 at 3.55pm. We go to school five days a
 week. There are 12 rooms in the school
 including a music room and  a library.
 There are 11 teachers including the   
 headmaster,and about 220 pupils.Among 
 the lessons we take are History,      
 Geography, English, Maths, Science and
 Music.My favourite lesson is History. 
 The school has a stereo, video and    
 colour TV as well as a computer,      
 printer and photocopier.              
 Among the games we play are football, 
 rounders, cricket and netball.        
 Most people stay for school dinners,  
 some pay and others get them free.    
 Occasionally we go on school trips and
 visits.We have holidays at Summer,    
 Christmas, Easter and Spring Bank.
