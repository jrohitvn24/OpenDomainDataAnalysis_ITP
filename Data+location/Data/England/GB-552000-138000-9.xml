		<content> Langton Green and Fordcome both have a
 number of clubs or societies where    
 people with similar interests meet,   
 often in the village halls. There are 
 local branches of the Women's         
 Institute and Young Wives as well as a
 group called The Langton Ladies. The  
 "Over 60's" mainly supported by       
 retired Pensioners is very popular.   
 The younger generation may join a     
 Guide or Scout Pack or its younger    
 counterpart and there is a Youth Club 
 for teen-agers. Creative activities   
 include Horticulture, Art and Flower  
 Arranging. There are Football,        
 Cricket, Badminton and Stoolball      
 clubs which play clubs elsewhere and a
 Keep Fit group. Beside meeting for    
 pleasure members of the British Legion
 help ex-service people. Both villages 
 have Preservation Societies to monitor
 any proposed building development.    </content>
