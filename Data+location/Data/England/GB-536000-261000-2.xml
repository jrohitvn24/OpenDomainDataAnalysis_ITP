		<title>02BAR HILL</title>
		<content>    Bar Hill is a "new village",built  
 on a green field site,and,we believe, 
 totally unique in this country.       
 Building started about eighteen years 
 ago and is now only just nearing      
 completion.The total population is    
 expected to be about five thousand.   
 The village is self-contained with its
 own industrial/commercial centre,     
 shopping centre - which includes a    
 Tesco Superstore -,school,social and  
 sporting facilities,public house,     
 church,allotments,parish council and  
 housing - both council and private.   
   The village is generally well laid  
 out,with plenty play areas,open space,
 trees and attractive landscaping.The  
 houses have been built in groups or   
 small estates that extend from the    
 perimeter road in towards the centre.
