		<content>     Surfleet is a small village  4    
 miles north of{Spalding}in the heart  
 of prime fenland agricultural land.   
 The parish is made up more than 93% of
 arable crop fields with horticultural 
 smallholdings containing glasshouses  
 and intensively-grown salad crops.    
 The orchards have been reduced to a   
 tiny area.  Main cash crops are sugar 
 beet,tulip and daffodil bulbs,brassica
 crops,wheat and barley.  Cucumbers and
 tomatoes are important horticultural  
 crops.                                
     The parish is divided in two by   
 the{A 16}road running north from      
 Spalding to Boston.  The southern     
 boundary is the{River Glen,}a fisher_ 
 man's stream where waterbirds abound. 
     The village has grown recently    
 with the building of new homes in     
 several locations.
