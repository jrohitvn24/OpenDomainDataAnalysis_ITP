		<title>05MORETON SCHOOL BADGE&amp;UNIFORM</title>
		<content> The school badge is shaped like a     
 shield. It is in 3 sections. In one of
 the sections there is a cross.This is 
 because we are a Church of England    
 School. In another section there are  
 three scimitars that stand for the    
 county of Essex.In the third section  
 there are the initials of the school  
 M.P.S.                                
 We do have a uniform, but more        
 children wear it in winter than in    
 summer. The school colours are        
 blue/grey and maroon. The uniform for 
 the boys is a pair of grey or black   
 trousers, white shirt and school      
 tie,and for the girls is a grey skirt 
 and a white blouse and tie. In the    
 summer the girls can wear a pink or   
 blue gingham dress.                   
 Over half the children usually wear   
 uniform, and others sometimes do.
