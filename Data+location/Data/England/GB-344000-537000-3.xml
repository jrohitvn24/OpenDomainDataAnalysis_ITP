		<content> Our area survey indicates that 88% of 
 families/homes own and use a car, 12% 
 also operate motorcycles, and all     
 homes possess at least one bicycle.   
                                       
 In order to live reasonably in a rural
 area such as this, some means of      
 independent transport would seem      
 essential for most people.  There are 
 no bus services in the area, and those
 who are elderly, infirm or handicapped
 are dependent on good will of         
 neighbours or organisations.          
                                       
 Our team lists family outings,        
 shopping, visiting relatives and      
 holidays as reasons for owning a car. 
 Our team's parents might want to add  
 to this that running a car is         
 essential for getting to and from     
 work.
