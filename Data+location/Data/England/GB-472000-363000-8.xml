		<title>08RELIGION IN OSSINGTON (1)</title>
		<content>    The{18th century Church of the Holy
{Rood}at{Ossington}is set in beautiful 
 rural countryside. It is part of the  
{Worldwide Anglican Communion}and      
 services are still held regularly     
 every Sunday with an average          
 congregation of fourteen. Looking at  
 the Church register for the last{five 
{years}there have been{five baptisms,  
{three funerals}and{one wedding.       
    The Church is part of the group of 
 parishes of{Norwell, Ossington}and    
{Cromwell}formed into a{United Benefice
 in{1983.}This group in turn is part of
 the{Rural Deanery}of{Tuxford/Norwell  
 which is part of{Southwell Diocese.   
    There are six Church bells which   
 are regularly rung by a team of local 
{campanologists.}The Church is reached 
 by passing through a large iron       
 gateway originally leading to         
{Ossington Hall, now demolished.       </content>
