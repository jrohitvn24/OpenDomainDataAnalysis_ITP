     The Barnard family gave the       
 vestry, stained glass window and the  
 tower clock. They also built a tunnel 
 from the castle to the church for the 
 family and their servants to go to    
 Sunday prayers.                       
    On two of the pillars in the nave  
 are the letters RW and WW. They stand 
 for Richard Washington and William    
 Washington. They were thought to be   
 ancestors of George Washington, the   
 first President of America.           
    The altar table was given by Dr.   
 Storrs Fox and his brothers in memory 
 of their parents. In York Minster     
 there is a silver cup from our church,
 it has the Hull hallmark and is dated 
 1640. In 1850 the church got an       
 organ.In the tower there are three    
 bells made by Sellers of York.
