		<content> Our particular area is mainly         
 agricultural farmland,with a few areas
 of deciduos woodland.To the North     
 West, in the valley of the river Pang,
 lies part of the village of Compton   
 with a population of approximately    
 2,500.Here there is a primary school  
 and a small comprehensive school      
 serving all the local villages.Close  
 by the primary school can be seen the 
 route of the railway which once ran   
 from Didcot to Southampton.In the     
 North East lies Aldworth,a small rural
 village of approximately 500          
 people.The rest of the area has a     
 scatterd population.                  
   Race horses are trained on some of  
 the many  cart_tracks crossing the    
 chalk downland.                       
   Other places of interest include    
 an old second world war airfield,two  
 old churches and two playing fields.  </content>
