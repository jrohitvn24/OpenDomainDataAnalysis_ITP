		<title>18PLANTLIFE AROUND GRASSMOOR.</title>
		<content> The whole area has little clumps of   
 trees and the hedges around the fields
 have not been disturbed except where  
 the pit tips are being removed.       
 The most common trees are ash, oak,   
 beech, sycamore and chestnuts. The    
 hedges are mostly hawthorn with some  
 elder, willow and holly in between    
 them. A wide variety of wild flowers  
 and grasses share the hedgerows. There
 are hardly any evergreen trees.       
 The elm trees have been attacked by   
 Dutch Elm disease and a large number  
 in the area have died or been cut down
 Two have been taken from Grassmoor    
 School grounds and four more from the 
 park opposite.                        
 The children favour the chestnut tree 
 which in the autumn provides them with
 fruit for their 'conker' competitions.
