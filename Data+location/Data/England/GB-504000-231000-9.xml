		<content>  When asked about holidays most people
 replied that they had taken at least  
 one during the last year.More people  
 had travelled in Great Britain than   
 abroad. The areas in this country were
 very varied, from Scotland in the     
 north to Bournemouth in the south, and
 from Wales and Cornwall in the west to
 Yarmouth and Kent in the east.        
  Most holidays abroad were to Europe, 
 but America and Greece also featured.
