The River Nene flows close to the      
village and the wide valley was formed 
by a glacier.In many places between    
Northampton and Peterborough there are 
gravel workings.The ones in Ringstead  
began in 1969. Here the gravel is about
five feet below the surface and has an 
average depth of 10 feet.              
The first area to be dug was a pool,   
near the grading plant, to provide     
water to wash the gravel.Then Ringstead
Trout Lake was started. It took two and
a  half years and produced one and a   
half million tons of gravel.About ten  
people work on the ARC site and new    
sites are still being excavated.On the 
site of the lake there used to be an   
old hand-worked sand pit for the people
building cottages long ago.
