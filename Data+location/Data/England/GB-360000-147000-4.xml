		<content> There are 20 farms in our area.Most   
 of them are small and they farm up to 
 90 cattle,about 3/4 of them are dairy 
 cattle for milking and the others are 
 calves or beef cattle.Land is         
 used for silage and haymaking as well 
 as grazing. Farms average around      
 100-150acres and this year a 165      
 acres farm produced 30 acres of hay   
 and 103 acres of silage from two      
 cuttings which weighed 42 tons.There  
 is one pig farm.It has got more than  
 100 pigs.They stay for about four     
 weeks or die before that.There are 2  
 intensive chicken farms one in Oakhill
 and one in Binegar.There are 5,000 in 
 the one at Binegar.They come in at one
 day old from the hatchery and go out  
 at about six weeks old.Then catchers  
 come and take them back to a factory  
 were they are then killed.
