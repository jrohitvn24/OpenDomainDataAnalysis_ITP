		<content> The 4 women volunteers who compiled   
 this survey are all active middle-aged
 members of Cheriton Bishop Women's    
 Institute, and between them they have 
 10 grown-up children; 7 boys and 3    
 girls. All the children have had to   
 leave home because of lack of         
 employment opportunities in the area. 
 None of us has a paid full-time job; 3
 drive cars. The most popular hobby is 
 gardening, followed by reading,       
 writing, entertaining, sewing,        
 knitting, spinning and wine-making.   
 Other pastimes include theatre-going, 
 eating out in local pubs, day outings 
 and holidays both at home and abroad, 
 genealogy, singins, walking and       
 researching local history.

 Steadman and Hazel Wilson.
