		<title>18The Supernatural</title>
		<content>There are many stories connecting old  
buildings in Cranbrook with the        
supernatural.The best example is the   
Pest house,built in 1369.It was first  
used as a hospital for plague victims. 
Many were buried beneath the cellars.  
An occupant of the house Robert Newman 
 claims he saw the ghost of Theresa    
Benenden who lived there in the 16th   
century.Two brothers William and Edward
Deane are also said to have seen ghosts
there.Tape recordings have been made of
strange noises.Another building where a
ghost has been recorded is Broadcloth  
next to the old studio.A ghost seen by 
Mrs Davey a teacher at Angley school,is
that of a young girl who died when the 
house was a weavers cottage.The pest   
house is well known to Cranbrook       
people,although many appear unsure as  
to whether stories of ghosts are real  
or just myths.                         </content>
