		<content> Then one of the people said that      
 newcomers were snobbish. When we got  
 back to school we talked about why    
 some people thought that newcomers    
 were snobbish. We decided that people 
 who came into our area from outside   
 mostly had the best houses so they    
 probably have better jobs and more    
 money than those people who have lived
 in the village all their lives. So    
 we think that jealousy has something  
 to do with it. We also thought        
 that people who have always lived     
 here do not want the area to change.  
 Most people  said that newcomers      
 were alright. One lady said that the  
 majority of newcomers work all day so 
 she never met them. We went to one    
 door and a woman said "I don't want to
 be on a computer", but her husband    
 said he would try to help us. Some    
 people would not even answer the door.</content>
