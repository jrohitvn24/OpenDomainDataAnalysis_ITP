		<content>{MINCINGFIELD FARM, DURLEY (G.R. SU    
{527165) Owner: Mr. E. Bastian         
 This farm is run in conjunction with a
 second farm owned by the Bastian      
 family, but outside this study area:  
 Berrywood Farm at West End (G.R. SU   
 487152) The description here therefore
 explains how both farms are managed.  
 The whole complex totals about 800    
 acres, only 50 of which are at        
 Mincinfield. The bulk of the land is  
 dedicated to permanent pasture.       
 Maize, hay and grass for silage are   
 the main crops of the farms, all      
 geared towards the fattening of       
 cattle. However there are about 200   
 ewes kept on the farms because they   
 help to keep the paddocks tidy and    
 improve the pasture. Cattle are       
 allocated on a system of about 1 head 
 per acre, so about 50 are kept at     
 Mincinfield                           </content>
