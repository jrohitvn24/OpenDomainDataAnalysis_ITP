		<title>15CEMETERY AND CREMATORIUM</title>
		<content> The cemetery is a large place taking  
 up 25% of a kilometre square. The 4   
 boundaries of the cemetery are the{A5}
 or{Roman Road,}a footpath, the railway
 and the{Longden Road.}The cemetery has
 been enlarged twice over the years the
 last extension being in l9O9. Pictures
 in the local studies library show a   
 judge watching the{Bishop of Lichfield
 signing the opening of the extension, 
 others show how large the cemetery and
 chapel are.{Mary Webb,}a local poet is
 buried there. The whole cemetery can  
 be seen from the{A5}railway bridge.   
 Three miles from the cemetery to the  
 east of{Shrewsbury}is situated the    
 crematorium on the{London Road.}It is 
 about 25 years old and is very much   
 smaller than the cemetery. However, it
 is used far more now than the cemetery
 as cremation is preferred to burial by
 most people in this area.             </content>
