		<title>19The Old Schoolroom</title>
		<content> Known originally as Church House and  
 situated at the entrance to the       
 churchyard, the Old Schoolroom was    
 built at the end of the 15th          
 century for use as an ale house. Beer 
 was brewed in the huge fireplace and  
 sold to raise money for church        
 maintenance. Later the upper floor was
 used as a schoolroom and the lower    
 floor was a workhouse from about      
 1700.The old and sick were given      
 simple tasks to perform and provided  
 with food and shelter. There was also 
 a small room for use as an overnight  
 jail. Nowadays the Old Schoolroom is  
 used for all sorts of activities such 
 as yoga, ballet, Brownies, Guides,W.I.
 meetings and playgroup. The Old       
 Schoolroom is a beautiful building,   
 tastefully restored and possibly the  
 only building of its type in the      
 country.                              </content>
