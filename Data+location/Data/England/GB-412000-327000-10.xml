		<content> The block  is split into 3 areas _    
 lowland, woodland and the upper land. 
                                       
 The upper and lower lands are both    
 very flat with very heavy clay soil,  
 the village is well named _ Draycott  
 in the{Clay.}                         
                                       
 The woodland is very old and is now   
 almost equally deciduous/coniferous,  
 although most of the coniferous areas 
 have been planted fairly recently.    
 Some of the mature hardwoods e.g.{oak 
{and ash}were planted 150 years ago.   
                                       
 Over the last few years{Dutch Elm     
{Disease}has wiped out 2-3000 elms, but
 it is hoped that the remaining 30 or  
 so elms will now be immune from it.   
                                       
 The forest timber is used mainly for  
 furniture, pallets and fencing.       </content>
