		<content>As most of our block is grassland, the 
main source of occupation is farming.  
The bulk of the farm animals are sheep 
and cattle, hens and chickens.         
The cattle are reared for dairy        
farming, whilst the sheep and poultry  
are reared to provide food in the form 
of meat and eggs. These animals graze  
on enclosed rough grazing land.        
Other land consists of intensively     
managed grassland,providing sileage.   
There are four silos situated in the   
near vicinity of our school. Two of    
our photographs for the Domesday       
Project were taken from the top of a   
silo.
