		<title>10THE OLD SCHOOL CAPEL</title>
		<content>   The old village school was opened in
 1911.With the closure of first Hougham
 and then Alkham schools a new school  
 was constructed in Capel and opened in
 1972.                                 
   The Old School is now a residential 
 centre for Kent schoolchildren.When we
 visited the centre there was a group  
 of 25 Secondary school  children in   
 residence.One of the original         
 classrooms has been divided into two  
 dormitories,one for boys and one for  
 girls.The headmistress's study is now 
 a staff bedroom.A new kitchen and     
 showers have been built.The 'modern'  
 mobile classroom, built in 1967 ,is   
 now a lecture and recreation room.The 
 other original classroom is now a     
 combined canteen and T.V. room.       
   Groups usually spend 4 to 5 days at 
 the centre,exploring and studying the 
 local area.                           </content>
