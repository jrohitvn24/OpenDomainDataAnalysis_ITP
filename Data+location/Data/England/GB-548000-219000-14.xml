		<title>14USE OF THE RIVER STORT IN 85</title>
		<content> One of the things the rivewr is used  
 for today is canoeing.The canoe club  
 store their canoeing equipment in the 
 farmers Southmill lock-keepers        
 cottage. The old lock is still in     
 working order. It has been painted    
 black and white and their is a badge  
 to show when the lock was last        
 repaired. They have made a special    
 plank to slide the canoes down into   
 the water. In our school there were 19
 children that had been fishing in the 
 Stort. One boy was trying to get a    
 licence to fish. There were 32        
 children who went horse riding by the 
 river and 32 children had beenon a    
 boat on the river. A company called   
 Elliots have just started building    
 houses there because it is such a     
 lovely place. There will be problems  
 with the cars because of the parking. 
 The fumes may destroy the flowers.    </content>
