		<title>09INDUSTRY IN HITCHIN</title>
		<content>   There are 2 main industrial estates 
 in Hitchin. Both are situated to the  
 north of the town.                    
   Bury Mead estate is the smaller.    
 Just over 100 years ago there was a   
 sewage farm here. This developed into 
 the fully automatic sewage treatment  
 works that dominates one side of the  
 estate. It serves a total of 36,000   
 people and treats 2.25 million gallons
 of sewage a day. The other side of the
 estate has many new electronics firms.
   Several of the older firms have     
 closed down. K.I.R. Gloves is an      
 exception, having been on the estate  
 for over 50 years.                    
   The Cadwell Lane estate has a wide  
 cross section of businesses,ranging   
 from high technology firms to a dairy.
 There are two other industries worthy 
 of note:Russell's (leather) and       
 Ransom's (chemical manufacturers).    </content>
