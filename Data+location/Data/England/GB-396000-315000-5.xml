		<title>05Recreation on the Chase.</title>
		<content>    There are lots of narrow paths and 
wider tracks across the hills and      
valleys of our survey block. These are 
ideal for walkers or those on          
horseback, and they are also used for  
practice by joggers and runners.       
    There are many public rights of    
way through the forest, and easy to    
follow way-marked trails cross both    
heath and forest areas.                
    The Chase is popular too for       
orienteering events.                   
    Many people just sit by their cars 
and enjoy the views. Many take a       
picnic to enjoy in the fresh air.
