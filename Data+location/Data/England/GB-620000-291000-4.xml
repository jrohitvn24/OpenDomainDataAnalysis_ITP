		<content>    At Shelton School{42 pupils}are    
 taught in a Victorian style buiding   
 with very large and high windows. The 
 brick building is crowned with a bell 
 tower and is surrounded by a small    
 playground and there is a games field 
 on the other side of the road. It is  
 one if the few schools remaining in   
 South Norfolk with outside toilets.  {
{   Pupils are drawn from the villages 
{of Shelton, Hardwick and Fritton.}The 
 day begins at 9.00am with a lesson of 
 English or Mathematics. There is a 15 
 minute break in the morning and this  
 is usually followed by a period of    
 creative writing. After a lunch break 
 of one hour the pupils are usually    
 engaged on projects in History,       
 Geography or Science. Infants and     
 juniors work together and a           
 headteacher with one assistant        
 preside. The day ends with a story.   </content>
