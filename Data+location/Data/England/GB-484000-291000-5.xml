Great Easton is the one village in the 
area that actually showed signs of     
growth. As well as the old stone houses
in the middle of the village there are 
also one or two new housing areas.The  
village does have two shops,a garage   
and a pub. Running through the centre  
ofthe village is a small brook. Life is
very quiet here, most people in the    
village are either connected with      
farming or else commute to nearby      
towns.
