		<title>16Fishpond Lock</title>
		<content>      On the way to{Fishpond Lock}the  
 road was stony and the area around it 
 was mostly waste land, with weeds and 
 rubbish. There were many wild flowers.
 We also passed an old{railway bridge  
 which was used for carrying rubbish to
 the waste land.                       
      We then met the{lock keeper.}He  
 was in an office where he operated the
 lock. We saw a few boats go through   
 the lock and then we asked him some   
 questions. We asked him which boats   
 went down the lock and he told us he  
 gets 600 ton{tankers,}belonging       
 to Petrofina and Elf, which bring     
 petrol from the{River Humber}to       
 storage depots at{Knostrop.}The other 
 boats that go down are pleasure boats 
 and barges. The locks are operated by 
{electronic and hydraulic power.
