    Wigmore is a small village situated
 about 10 miles N.W of Leominster on   
 the A4110 four miles south of         
 Leintwardine.It was once a very       
 important town.There is a castle just 
 outside the village which was first   
 built by order of King Edward in      
 921A.D.                               
 It was later replaced by a Norman     
 castle which housed the Mortimer      
 family.It was very important in Norman
 times.The village has several         
 buisnesses and still boosts a Norman  
 church in the shadow  of the castle   
 from which breathtaking views over the
 Wigmore basin can be observed
