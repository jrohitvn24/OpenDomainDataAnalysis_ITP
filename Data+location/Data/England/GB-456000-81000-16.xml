		<title>16VICTORIAN SHANKLIN</title>
		<content> During Victoria's reign, Shanklin grew
 from a small village to a prosperous  
 holiday resort.The first tourists were
 weathy people who built villas on top 
 of the cliff and atthe edge of the old
 village.They were attracted to the    
 island by Queen Victorias choice of   
 Osborne House as her hoilday          
 retreat.When the railway line came to 
 Shanklin in 1864, it opened the way   
 for ordinary people to hoilday        
 there,and photographs taken in late   
 Victorian times show that they came in
 their thousands,bathing from bathing  
 machines and strolling along the pier.
 Because of the chalybeate springs,    
 Shanklin also attracted members of the
 aristocracy and minor royalty.
