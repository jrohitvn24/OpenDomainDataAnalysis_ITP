   Most people in Soham are satisfied  
 with the range of clubs and leisure   
 activities available, but the most    
 common complaint was the lack of a    
 public swimming pool. Many people     
 would also enjoy a cinema, and also   
 felt that more entertainment for      
 teenagers would be beneficial.
