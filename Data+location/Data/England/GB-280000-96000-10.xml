		<title>10POSBURY CLUMP</title>
		<content> Posbury Clump is an eerie,spooky      
 place.It is very overgrown with many  
 wild flowers,ivies and stinging       
 nettles.There are cowslips,wild       
 orchids and we heard a woodpecker at  
 work.It is the site of an old,deserted
 quarry.The quarry was formed by an    
 isolated outcrop of volcanic 'trap'   
 rising about 300 feet above the two   
 river valleys.We saw some of the rock 
 that was once quarried - Red Sandstone
 which is very common in the Crediton  
 area.We have very red,clay soil.The   
 trees have grown very tall.We also    
 found gun cartridges so we know that  
 some creatures are hunted(probably    
 rabbits or pigeons).The Clump is about
 250 million years old.It is quite a   
 well known landmark and is easily     
 visible from all round the area.Some  
 of the stone was used to build part of
 Crediton Parish Church,about 1900 +.  </content>
