		<title>12Bookham Churches</title>
		<content> There are a number of well attended   
 churches in the area. 2 are Anglican; 
 St.Nicolas at Bookham &amp; St.Marys at   
 Fetcham. Both churches date back to   
 Saxon times but have modern church    
 halls and recently a new rectory has  
 been built in Bookham.                
                                       
 There are also 2 Catholic Churches at 
 Effingham &amp; Fetcham, a Baptist Church 
 in the centre of Bookham and a United 
 Reformed Church. All the churches     
 support their own clergy.             
                                       
 On an average Sunday, St.Nicolas can  
 have 300-400 in the congregation. This
 suggests that the churches have a fair
 influence on Bookham life. Each year  
 there are occasions for ecumenical    
 worship, either in the Barn Hall or as
 the climax to Village Week, an open   
 air service in St.Nicolas churchyard. </content>
