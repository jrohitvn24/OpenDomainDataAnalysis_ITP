 go inside and do some maths and things
 like that. Then we have assembly in   
 the hall.After we go back to class    
 our teacher tells us we can go out to 
 play. If we want, we can have a       
 biscuit and a milkshake. Then we go   
 out to play.{Playtime finishes}at     
 quarter to eleven. I do language or   
 finish other work before my group go  
 swimming, then I read until mid-day.
