		<content> Stonegate School was founded in 1842. 
 The school was built and financed by  
 the Courthope family.                 
                                       
 The original building has been        
 extended to provide suitable          
 accommodation for children of primary 
 school age.In 1985 a new playground is
 being constructed and plans are being 
 prepared for further necessary        
 modifications.                        
                                       
 95 children aged from 5 to 11 years   
 attend the school.They are organised  
 into four classes.All aspects of the  
 curriculum are taught,and the school  
 strives to foster a happy,instructive 
 environment for its pupils.The        
 highlight of 1985 has been the        
 residential visit to the Snowdonia    
 National Park.
