		<content>    The Rector, Rev R Moorsom kindly   
 took us on a tour of the Church.      
    This is the second Anglican Church 
 built in Lulworth.The first,built in  
 Norman times,was pulled down in 1869  
 and the stone used to build the new   
 one on a different site in 1870."Early
 Geometrical Gothic",it was built to   
 seat 300 and there are painted texts  
 over the nave arches.The font and     
 pulpit are made of Purbeck stone and  
 the lectern is carved in the shape of 
 an eagle.                             
    Of particular interest, is the     
 Communion Table made from the beams of
 the old church, behind this is a      
 beautiful wooden screen brought from  
 OBERAMMERGAU in Germany.It has 4      
 carved panels depicting, The Nativity 
 of Jesus, His Baptism,The Crucifixion 
 and the Breaking of Bread after the   
 walk to Emmaus.                       </content>
