		<title>18TRANSPORT HURN AIRPORT BUSES</title>
		<content> Near{Ferndown}there is a small airport
 called{Bournemouth Hurn Airport.}It is
 very busy, especially in summer. There
 are scheduled services to and from    
 the Channel Islands, domestic flights,
 and flights for package holidays      
 abroad. Flowers, fruit and vegetables 
 are flown in and taken quickly to the 
 shops to be sold. On many occasions,  
 when other airports are closed because
 of bad weather, passenger aircraft are
 diverted to Hurn from the major       
 airports. My Dad runs a helicopter    
 charter service from Hurn.            
                                       
 There are many regular{bus services   
 through Ferndown to towns nearby. For 
 children who live further away from   
 school, there is a special school bus 
 service. It is half fare for children 
 under 14. There are single and        
 double-decker buses.                  </content>
