		<title>08ST.PAUL'S DOVE HOLES.</title>
		<content> The Rev.D Burnett became vicar of Dove
 Holes in l985.Previously he was only  
 curate.Born in Truro,Cornwall,he lived
 at Bristol before coming to Dove Holes
 The church is l07 years old &amp; was     
 built as a chapel of ease to Chapel   
 Parish Church.It is no longer in that 
 parish,the change taking place on     
 March 20th l985 partly because Chapel 
 has expanded &amp; partly to encourage the
 smaller churches to integrate. The    
 parish which measures l0 miles across 
 is made up of Dove Holes,Peak Forest, 
 Wormhill &amp; Peak Dale.The vicar's home 
 is being altered to bring it up to    
 standard for a parish vicarage.The    
 yearly running cost of the church is  
 Â£5000-Â£6000.On Sunday there is one    
 main service followed by Sunday School
 soon to be called the "Adventurers".
