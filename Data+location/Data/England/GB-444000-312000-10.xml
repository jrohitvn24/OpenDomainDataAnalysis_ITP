		<title>10Employment in the Quarry</title>
		<content>  There are many{dangers}in the quarry 
 such as slurry pits, lorries, falling 
 stones, machinery and heaps of gravel.
 My grandad worked in the quarry for 30
 years. He saw a workmate killed by    
 falling rock. Two firemen have been   
 killed but overall the quarry has a   
 good{safety}record. When new employees
 come to the quarry they are given a   
 helmet and boots with metal toecaps.  
 My dad has worked in the quarry for 21
 years and my mum works in the offices.
 At one time most fathers would have   
 worked in the quarry but I did a      
 survey around the school and I found  
 out that out of about 50 families only
 7 fathers and 2 mothers work in the   
 Quarry.There is a{tar plant}which     
 produces tarmacadam for roads.There   
 are about 40 men on the tarmac gang.
