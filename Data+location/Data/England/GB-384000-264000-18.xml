		<title>18FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content> The Parish Council had{complaints}    
 from farmers and ramblers about the   
 footpaths. They formed a footpath sub-
 committee. It asked the advice of the 
 M.P. the county council, the ramblers 
 and the National Union of Farmers.They
 decided to realign some footpaths. The
{problem}was that people were going    
 through fields destroying crops and   
 through farmyards. Previously         
 footpaths had been{used}for going to  
 church and to work but now they are   
 being used as a leisure activity by   
 people from the towns. The            
 sub-committee had visited 42 farmers  
 in this area. The farmers have to pay 
 for the legal process of{changing}the 
 route of the footpaths but the walkers
 do not have to pay.Local{footpaths}may
 be overgrown, bridges and stiles are  
 broken or missing, paths may be       
 obstructed by mud or barbed wire.     </content>
