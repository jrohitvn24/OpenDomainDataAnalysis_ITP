		<content>    This whole area is within the      
 Braydon Forest area of "high          
 ecological value", as in the 1983     
 Draft of Wiltshire Landscape Plan.    
 (Wiltshire County Council).           
    Geology - mainly Oxford Clay with  
 small areas of undifferentiated       
 Glacial Drift.                        
    Vegetation/Habitats-mixture of     
 woodland &amp; pasture with little arable 
 and a few streams.                    
    Pasture-not yet surveyed by Conserv
 ationists, but probably a mixture of  
 hay, silage and permanent pasture     
 which has been agriculturally improved
 Some unimproved, neutral grassland may
 still exist, probably of a slightly   
 acidic type. The wild flowers Betony  
 and Meadow Thistle grow in such areas.
    Hedges-likely to be species-rich.  
    Streams-ecological value unknown   
 but good flora on edges.              </content>
