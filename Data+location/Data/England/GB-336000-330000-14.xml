		<title>14Pastimes around Hordley</title>
		<content>  People have to travel at least as far
 as Ellesmere to join formal societies.
 People in our area belong to a variety
 of  clubs  ranging from  drama  to the
 motor  club.  Frankton  and  Ellesmere
 have branches of both W.I. and Mothers
 Union  but it is difficult  for ladies
 to  get  to  these  traditional  rural
 pastimes. Gardening  is  popular, with
 most houses sporting attractive flower
 gardens  and  having  large  vegetable
 patches. Indoor activities  range from
 Open University to commercial knitting
 where  one lady  spins  her  own  wool
 using a spinning wheel. A local artist
 paints  landscapes  and  boats while a
 lady paints decorated  eggs. Outdoors,
 the canal is popular for fishing  with
 youngsters,and some farmers  are  keen
 shots. Pigeon fancying is found in the
 area  while more energetic play squash
 at nearby Ellesmere College.          </content>
