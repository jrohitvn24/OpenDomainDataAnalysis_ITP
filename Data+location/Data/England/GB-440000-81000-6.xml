		<title>06BRIGHSTONE PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>  We spoke to a resident of Brighstone 
 about her duties as a pariah          
 councillor. She told us that she and  
 seven others represented the 1500_1600
 people living in the parish.In her 23 
 years of service the population has   
 doubled.                              
  Every month they meet to discuss     
 matters ranging from footpaths to     
 tidiness!They also raise money and put
 this to a variety of amenities. For   
 example they have bought a recreation 
 ground and a permanent library for the
 village.(This is instead of the mobile
 library that used to serve the        
 village.)                             
  It is the job of the parish council  
 to take complaints to the county      
 council in Newport. A common one is   
 about the roads! The councillor we    
 spoke to combined this chore with her 
 weekly shopping trip to Newport.      </content>
