		<title>19ALL ABOUT ME FROM CLAYPOLE</title>
		<content>       My name is Richard White and I  
 live in Claypole. My birthday is on   
 February 13th and I am eight years    
 old. My mum's name is Josie and dad's 
 is Paul. I have two brothers, David   
 and Christopher. My best friend is    
 Marc Tollerton.                       
       I live on Cleveland Farm in     
 Claypole. The best time is harvest    
 because we can play on the bales.     
       I have a rabbit and a dog called
 Judy. My pet cow is called Buttercup  
 and my pet sheep I have named Domino  
 because he is black and white. I also 
 have a budgerigar.                    
       I collect teddy bears and so    
 far have thee hundred. China animals I
 also collect and I have sixty.My      
 favourite toy is a game called Jungle 
 Fever. If you have the right card you 
 have to make the animal's noise and   
 others have to guess it.              </content>
