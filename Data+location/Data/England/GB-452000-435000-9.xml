		<title>09Traffic in the south of area</title>
		<content> Traffic has increased along the B1222 
 Sherburn-in-Elmet to Cawood road since
 the development of the Selby Coalfield
 Four buses per shift take miners from 
 West Yorkshire to the Wistow pit.     
 Cawood Bridge has a weight limit of   
 6tons but many drivers prefer this    
 river crossing to the toll bridge in  
 Selby,so it is a popular through route
 from West Yorkshire to York and the   
 east.                                 
  Much of the area traffic is local-   
 private cars,agricultural vehicles, or
 delivery vans.The more remote and less
 populated areas such as Brackenhill   
 Lane,Little Fenton and Biggin are     
 poorly served by bread vans etc.which 
 visit Nanny Lane/Broad Lane regularly.
 In all areas milk is delivered on     
 alternate days only.Therefore, a car  
 and a freezer are considered necessary
 by many residents.                    </content>
