		<title>07The Shah Jehan Mosque,Woking</title>
		<content>  The Mosque was built in 1889 by Dr.  
 Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner. It was the  
 first mosque to be built in England   
 and served the Asian community in     
 London as well as local Muslims. It is
 situated in Oriental Road.            
  The building is made from Bath and   
 Bargate stone and the design came from
 other Oriental mosques. It has an     
 onion shaped green dome.              
  The Indian Muslims worship there. The
 Imam preaches and teaches the Muslims 
 from the Koran, their Holy Book.      
  There are about seven hundred Muslims
 in Woking, most of whom live in the   
 Maybury area. It is very common to see
 whole families in their national      
 dress. Many of the men work as        
 shop-keepers or in local factories.
