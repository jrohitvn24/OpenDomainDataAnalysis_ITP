		<title>12Changing Times in W Wickham</title>
		<content>   There are many more families with   
two cars than there were. Therefore    
more cars are parked in the road. More 
people now live in W Wickham and the   
shops have had to change to allow for  
this. Many shoppers come from outside W
Wickham. In 1964 there were no restau- 
rants in the High Street, but now there
are six. e chemist's is built where W  
Wickham's cinema used to be. The parks,
gardens and even roundabouts are better
looked after now, with more flowers be-
ing planted.

   Changing needs are shown by the de- 
molition last year of the house by the 
station to make way for old people's   
flats. The swimming bath, built in the 
mid-1960's, is a major local amenity.
