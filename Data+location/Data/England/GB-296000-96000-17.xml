		<content> The disadvantages of modern houses is 
 that you are crowded because they are 
 next to each other and the neighbours 
 are always looking at you.The new     
 houses look like white boxes in rows. 
 Flats are like little boxes on top of 
 each other.The advantages of a new    
 house is that you have two toilets.   
 They are easier to clean because there
 are less rooms.There is a middle size 
 kitchen which has a built_in cooker   
 and cupboards plus work_surfaces. They
 are better designed and it is lighter 
 inside and easier to sell because of  
 these reasons. Another thing is that  
 you live closer to all of your        
 friends.
