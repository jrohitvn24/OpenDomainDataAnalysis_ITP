		<title>17FARMING NEAR NEWTON.</title>
		<content> Until 2 years ago this estate land was
 tenanted by 4 farmers.At next Lady Day
 only 2 will remain for a large farming
 company is taking over.The 2 remaining
 tenants are near retirement and then  
 their land also will go to the        
 company.The change is making a large  
 complex of farm buildings in the      
 centre of Newton redundant for farming
 purposes.What will happen to it is a  
 cause of concern to Newton villagers. 
 The company is highly mechanised and  
 concerned largely with arable farming,
 growing crops such as wheat,barley and
 rape.It does have a large sheep flock 
 which is still sometimes pastured on  
 the former village sheepwalk.The      
 smaller farmers tend to concentrate on
 fattening cattle and have little      
 arable land.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
