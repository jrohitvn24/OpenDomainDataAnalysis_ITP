		<content>{CRESSBROOK AND WARDLOW AREA}          
 This is an area in the Peak District  
 National Park comprised of Carbonif-  
 erous limestone covered by rough      
 pasture, river meadow, moorland and   
 deciduous woods. The River Wye creates
 the deep dales, Upper Monsal and      
 Cressbrook. The land rises from 235 to
 391 metres on Longstone Moor and      
 Wardlow Hay Top. The B6465 road from  
 Wardlow, a small agricultural village,
 runs South to Monsal Head. Minor roads
 go to Cressbrook (a mill village in   
 the Wye Valley), to Litton and Litton 
 Mill. Fluorspar is mined, but lead    
 workings are abandoned. Rambling,     
 fishing,and the glorious scenery      
 attract visitors, thus creating       
 employment. Buildings are of local    
 limestone. Farms with small stone     
 walled fields support dairy cows, beef
 and sheep. Population is of all ages. </content>
