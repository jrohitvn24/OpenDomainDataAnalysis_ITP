		<content>  FARMING AND TOURISM ARE THE MOST     
 IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES OF THE WOOKEY    
 HOLE AREA, BUT TECHNOLOGY AND ART HAVE
 RECENTLY BEEN INTRODUCED.             
  MOST OF THE FARMING IS MIXED OR DAIRY
 FARMING;THE NUMBER OF COWS TENDING TO 
 DECREASE AS PASTURE IS USED HIGHER UP 
 THE SLOPES OF THE MENDIP HILLS.       
  CATERING FOR THE NEEDS OF TOURISTS OR
 CAMPERS IS A PRIORITY, AND ALL THE    
 ATTRACTIONS OF THE CAVES,NOW RUN BY   
 MADAME TUSSAUD'S,ARE OFFERED FOR THE  
 ADMISSION CHARGE.                     
  A LARGE AREA OF THE CAVES'MAIN CAR   
 PARK IS NOW PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED BY   
 EMPLOYEES OF THORN E.M.I. HOUSED IN   
 PART OF THE OLD PAPER MILL.           
  THE FORMER METHODIST CHAPEL IN WOOKEY
 HOLE IS NOW A STUDIO WHERE SCULTURES  
 OF NATURAL HISTORY, USING MODERN AND  
 TRADITIONAL MATERIALS, ARE MADE.
