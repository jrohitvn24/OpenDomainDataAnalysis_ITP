		<content> Most parents,when they cook a meal at 
 home,make sure that there is a mixture
 of vegetables,meat and fruit.Now we   
 seem to be eating not so much meat.In 
 Falmer School Canteen,there is a large
 selection,from salads to cakes,and    
 snacks to hot dinners.Most people     
 nowadays choose their own balanced    
 diet from shops and cafes without even
 realising it,like eating a grapefruit 
 for breakfast,like quite a few people 
 do now,will give you vitamin C for the
 whole day.Chips and hamburgers are    
 very popular in quite a few           
 countries,but in Brighton,so many     
 people visit here,so thousands of     
 chips and fatty foods will get eaten  
 in one year.All of my family like to  
 have some cakes,biscuits,chocolates or
 sweets once in a while,but too many   
 could damage your health. By D.Torch
