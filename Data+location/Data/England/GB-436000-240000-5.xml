		<title>05Alkerton Rectory</title>
		<content> At the old rectory there is a         
 remarkable door which is hinged in    
 such a way that only half of it can be
 opened at a time. In 1665, the year of
 the plague the door was moved from the
 south side to the north. This it is   
 said prevented the germs of the       
 plague, which were coming from the    
 south entering the house when the door
 was open. When the rectory was built  
 there were 2 rooms downstairs, 2 rooms
 upstairs and 2 more rooms in the apex.
 The rectory may not be famous but the 
 man who had it built was. Thomas      
 Lydiatt was born at Alkerton where he 
 lived for 30 years. When Prince Henry,
 son of James I, to whom Thomas was    
 tutor died he came back to Alkerton to
 be rector of the parish. In 1945 more 
 rooms were added &amp; later a coal cellar
 &amp; kitchen. There was an inglenook     
 fireplace in the lounge circa 1626.   </content>
