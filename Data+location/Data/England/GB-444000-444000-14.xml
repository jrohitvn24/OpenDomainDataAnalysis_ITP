		<title>14  BUYWELL SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content>      Buywell shopping centre is most  
 unusual as most of the shops are      
 underground bunkers that were once    
 munition factories in the last war.The
 centre is not near any major town.    
 Each shop has its own parking lot.    
 Most of the shops are sell domestic   
 items. They do not sell food. There   
 are two cafes one brand new and the   
 other one old. The new one packs up   
 picnic baskets for between Â£1-Â£2.     
                                       
      The shops are sited mostly in    
 pairs. It is like an avenue of        
 houses. There are also some new       
 toilets which are spotlessly clean and
 a special mother's room.              
                                       
      There are nine shop bunkers but  
 some of the shops are let to two or   
 three businesses.  People come from   
 miles around to shop here.            </content>
