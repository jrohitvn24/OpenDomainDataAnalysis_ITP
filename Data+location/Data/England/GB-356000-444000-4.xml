		<title>04ANCIENT CIRCLE, BLEASDALE</title>
		<content> Bleasdale Circle was a very important 
 discovery.It dates from Bronze Age    
 times and is about 2000 years old.It  
 was composed of an outer and inner    
 circle of oak logs.Around the inner   
 circle was a ditch the floor of which 
 was lined with parallel poles.        
                                       
 In the centre of the inner circle were
 buried two funeral urns which         
 contained burnt human bones.Inside one
 of the urns was a small pigmy cup.    
 The circle lies in the centre of a    
 peat moss known as Edmarsh or Admarsh.
                                       
 It was discovered in 1896 by a farmer,
 Thomas Kelsall.                       
                                       
 Some of the oak posts and the urns are
 in the Harris Museum,Preston.         
 The positions of the posts are now    
 marked by concrete posts.             </content>
