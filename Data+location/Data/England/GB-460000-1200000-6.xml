		<title>06The seasons in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> Autumn is called Hairst in Shetland,it
 means the harvest and it is a short   
 season.AS there are few trees,Autumn  
 is not very noticeable.Spring is      
 called Voar and it follows a long,dark
 Winter and it comes late.Suddenly     
 everyone is out of doors.During the   
 Summer the days are long and at       
 Mid-Summer it is the time of the      
 Simmer Dim.This is the twilight of a  
 Shetland Summer night when it remains 
 light for almost all the 24 hours of  
 the day and night.                    
   I like Summer best because you can  
 go fishing and sail model boats and go
 hunting for rabbits and rats.It stays 
 light all the time and in the school  
 holidays and at weekends you can stay 
 up late and have barbeques.
