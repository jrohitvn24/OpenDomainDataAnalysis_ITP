		<content> In this area we speak with a North    
 Country accent.We also have a{dialect 
 which means we use words which people 
 from other areas don't use or         
 understand.Sometimes we are lazy and  
 just don't pronounce {words}properly  
 e.g. we miss out the letter 't'-water 
 becomes waher.We say seen instead of  
 saw and done instead of did.Here are  
 some of our words:-bairn-child,spuggy-
 sparrow,laggy band-elastic band,hiya- 
 hello,howay-come on,beck-stream,safter
 -this afternoon. We also have some    
 sayings in our local{language}which   
 may not be used elsewhere:-to play war
 with-to tell off,get wrong-get into   
 trouble,brag of you-telltales about   
 you,feed your face-eat greedily.      
 Our language is simple and            
 uncomplicated and sometimes is not    
 appreciated by people from other      
 areas.                                </content>
