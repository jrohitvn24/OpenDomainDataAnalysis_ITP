		<content> Tnhis is an area of undulting         
 farmland, scattered farm houses and   
 buildings an small pockets of         
 woodland.  The two main areas of      
 settlement are the villages of        
 Bishopswood and buckland St Mary.     
 Dairy farming is important to this    
 area.  There are also some sheep.     
 fields are generally separated by     
 hedges.  The A303 passes through this 
 area and is very busy in summer.  the 
 rest of the area is served largely by 
 narrow, winding country lanes.  The   
 river yartly flows through the area   
 and there are many small streams and  
 springs.
