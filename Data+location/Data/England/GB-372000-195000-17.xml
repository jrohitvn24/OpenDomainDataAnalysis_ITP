		<content> There is only one major company in    
 this area using and selling computers,
 CAM systems.CAM stands for Computer   
 Aided Marketing.CAM systems sell a    
 wide range of computers including     
 Apple,IBM,Apricot,Zues and Cygnet.All 
 of these are supported by a large     
 range of Hard/Software,printers as    
 well as disc-drives and monitors.CAM  
 employ only 6 full-time staff,though  
 more are brought in when needed.The   
 company is trying to expand by gaining
 contracts abroad,in particular the    
 USA.Most of their computers are sold  
 to the motor trade for robot control  
 and book-keeping.No small businesses  
 in this area,eg.Post Office,newsagent,
 DIY shops,use computers.A survey in   
 Nibley indicated that computers are   
 still something of a mystery for many 
 adults and are thought of as games for
 children.                             </content>
