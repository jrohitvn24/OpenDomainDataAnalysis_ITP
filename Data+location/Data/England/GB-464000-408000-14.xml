 for training greyhounds,before that it
 was marshland.The land is now drained 
 by dykes and maintained by the        
 drainage board.At present the land is 
 used for grazing and growing hay but  
 they have had pigs,beef cattle and    
 chickens.When Millers bought the farm 
 there were no buildings now they have 
 a house,workshops,Dutch barn,livery,  
 stables and pigeon lofts.One store is 
 rented for storing waste paper.The 18 
 stables are also rented.Machinery on
