		<content> Many people enjoy country pursuits    
 such as riding, hunting and shooting, 
 both game and vermin. Bird watching   
 and nature study are encouraged at    
 school and a pony club appeals to     
 young riders. Many households have    
 dogs and walking is popular over the  
 many footpaths and bridleways. Rabbits
 are increasing and there are badgers, 
 foxes, stoats and other wild fauna.   
 Wild flowers have decreased with the  
 ploughing up and improvement of       
 downland, but bluebells and cowslips  
 survive. Elms are dead, but beech, oak
 and sycamore survive on the clay tops.
 Cherries, plums, sloes, blackberries  
 and mushrooms can be had from the     
 hedgerows. The balance between        
 conservation, agriculture and new     
 development is much discussed, part-  
 icularly where new building or tree   
 felling is proposed                   </content>
