		<title>13Law and Order in Bingley</title>
		<content> Bingley has its own police station and
 Magistrates' Court. There are four    
 cells at the station where people are 
 detained for questioning or awaiting  
 trial.                                
 11 police officers drive the patrol   
 cars and there are two dog handlers   
 who work with trained dogs. The dogs  
 are used mainly for tracking down     
 criminals or for sniffing out drugs.  
 The Magistrates' Court has two        
 courtrooms, one used for adults and   
 one for juveniles under sixteen. The  
 court sits each day during the week.  
 Usually three magistrates sit at each 
 session and are advised on points of  
 law by the Clerk to the Court. The    
 crime rate in Bingley is about the    
 same as the national average.         
 The most common offence is theft.
