		<content> The area has long been dominated by   
 the Tufton family. They are no longer 
 resident.Their family home, Hothfield 
 Place, visited by Queen Elizabeth 1st 
 was used by the military during World 
 War 2, was subsequently demolished by 
 the family for economic reasons &amp; most
 of the estate sold. When the railway  
 came to Ashford the Tufton's had a    
 station/halt built (now disused except
 for siding to Tarmac works).The       
 connecting Rd between Hothfield &amp;     
 Westwell is thus known as Station Rd. 
 Highwaymen operated from Foxenhill    
 Toll &amp; a gibbet was conveniently      
 placed at a nearby crossroad. Cade Rd.
 was named after Jack Cade reputed to  
 have been in hiding here.
