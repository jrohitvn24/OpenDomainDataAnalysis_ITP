		<content>  Pitchcombe is a village off the      
 Stroud-Gloucester road.With the hills 
 above thickly wooded,it is the most   
 attractive village in the whole area. 
 A castle,which used to stand in the   
 village but was demolished as long ago
 as 1155,may have connections with     
 Wragg castle which is a fine old stone
 house,previously known as Ragged      
 Castle Farm.Resthaven House of Healing
 was founded by Miss Maud Caruthers    
 Little and dedicated in 1938.         
  Pitchcombe is one of the sleepy      
 hollow villages.In 1983 when gales    
 left a trail of damage,fallen trees   
 blocked the roads and brought down    
 power lines,but services were restored
 whithin hours.The well-kept road-side 
 Church,made new in the last century,is
 still ringing the same bell which was 
 rung centuries ago and yew trees guard
 the church's entrance.                </content>
