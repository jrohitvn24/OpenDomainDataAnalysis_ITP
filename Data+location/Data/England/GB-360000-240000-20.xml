		<title>20CONCLUSION</title>
		<content>   This project has been useful and    
 one which it is hoped will be of use  
 to forthcoming generations.           
   The exercise has given children an  
 insight into many aspects of learning,
 it has broadened their use of maps    
 and reference materials,insomuch as it
 deals with their area,and people.     
   They tried in the time available to 
 set out facts and ideas about this    
 part of Hereford,in the footsteps of  
 the compilers of the original Domeday 
 Book,where Tarrington was mentioned.  
   When you read this in the future try
 to picture a small group of children  
 who have worked hard and long to put  
 onto a disc those facts which were    
 relevant at the time.
