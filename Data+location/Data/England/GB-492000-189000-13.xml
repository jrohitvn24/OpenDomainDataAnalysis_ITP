		<content> Beaconsfield has two main shopping    
areas -the Old and New Towns-with a    
smaller parade of shops in Holtspur.The
New Town is dominated by Waitrose,a new
supermarket,with its own carpark.This  
large site was obtained by demolishing 
a public house.Apart from food         
shops,there is a range of goods,       
including several boutiques, but no    
department stores.The shopping         
facilities are used by local residents 
and those from nearby villages and     
small towns.Regular shoppers in the Old
Town are local residents who shop here 
for their everyday needs.There are     
also several specialist shops in       
the Old Town that attract customers    
from a wide area. These include shops  
selling musical instruments, silk      
flowers, a saddler, antique and fine   
reproduction furniture.Holtspur shops  
serve the local community.             </content>
