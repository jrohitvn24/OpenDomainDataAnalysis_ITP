		<title>03Farming in Horton</title>
		<content> There were once 22 farms in this area 
 but now there are only eight.  All use
 family labour and casual workers when 
 necessary.  This has meant a great    
 reduction in the number of farm       
 workers.  New asbestos buildings are  
 gradually replacing the traditional   
 stone barns to meet the needs of      
 modern methods.  Heavy farm work is   
 done by tractors, each farm having two
 or three.  Other machinery includes   
 loading forks, mowers, balers, slurry 
 and muck spreaders.  Land-rovers and  
 trailers are used to transport animals
 to and from market.  Some farms use   
 motor-bikes for shepherding.          
                                       
 Farmers in 1985 are often restricted  
 by committees who see this area as a  
 playground for visitors as this is    
 part of the Dales National Park.
