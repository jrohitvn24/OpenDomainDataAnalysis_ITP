		<title>13ANNUAL VILLAGE FETE</title>
		<content> The annual village fete is now held on
 Rectory Field - part of Fitzjohns Farm
 on the 1st Saturday in July.          
 Originally organised by the Church    
 Council to raise funds for Church     
 restoration, it is now jointly run by 
 the Great Canfield Society and the    
 Church Council.                       
 The Fete consists of side shows,      
 competitive stalls, competitions such 
 as bowling for a turkey, tossing the  
 hay bale and children's races.        
 Afternoon teas and ices are served.   
 The fete is often followed by a       
 village barbecue in the evening.      
 The event usually raises about Â£400.
