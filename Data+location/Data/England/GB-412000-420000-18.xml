		<title>18THE POWER STATION</title>
		<content> When the power station burns coal, oil
 or gas, it produces hot steam. The hot
 steam turns the steam turbine, which  
 turns the generator, which produces   
 electricity. Meanwhile the steam gets 
 cooled by water from the river nearby.
 The water drips down on the rising    
 steam and then the water, which cooled
 the steam, is returned to the river.  
 The electricity is sent everywhere on 
 cables carried by pylons and sometimes
 underground.                          
 Electricity is sent to houses, shops, 
 offices and factories. It is very     
 important. It makes televisions,      
 videos, radios, computers and many    
 more things work. Electricity is very 
 important. Life would be very         
 different without it.
