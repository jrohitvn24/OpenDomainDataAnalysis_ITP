		<content> Running diagonally from North to East 
is the A646 Trunk road carrying traffic
from much of North East Lancashire to  
Todmorden and West Yorkshire. Many     
vehicles also use this road to by-pass 
Burnley town centre.                   
                                       
 Running from North to South is the A56
Trunk road running from Skipton and    
North Yorkshire, through the centre of 
Burnley and intersecting with the A646 
in the top right hand quarter of our   
area. It then proceeds to run          
southwards across the moors to         
Rawtenstall and eventually Manchester. 
Until early in 1985 this was an        
extremely busy road, but a lot of      
traffic has now been diverted to the   
newly opened motorway M65.
