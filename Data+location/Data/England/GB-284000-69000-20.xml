		<content>{East Ogwell}is on the outskirts of    
 Newton Abbot. Nearby are low rolling  
 hills and the small fields are mostly 
 permanent pasture, where cattle graze.
 In just a few places small patches of 
 woodland break up the{farming         
{landscape.}From here you can see the  
 village of{Denbury}beneath its        
 hillfort, and{Haytor}on the western   
 edge of{Dartmoor.}Narrow winding lanes
 have tall hedges on both sides which  
 makes driving hazardous. Bungalows    
 built in the 1960's,with large gardens
 are on the outskirts of East Ogwell. A
 large new{development}near the main   
 Newton Abbot to Totnes road has two   
 storey houses of various styles with  
 small gardens.Opposite is an old stone
 quarry used today as a depot by a firm
 of forklift truck makers.Several large
 farms houses with outbuildings and    
 barns are spread throughout the area. </content>
