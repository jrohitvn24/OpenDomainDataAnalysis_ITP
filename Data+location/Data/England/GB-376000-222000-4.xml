		<content> The original Hartpury Chapel was built
 in 1828, being replaced by the        
 existing Chapel with Schoolroom       
 beneath in 1887. It is unusual in     
 having a Burial Ground. From 1875     
 until his death in 1930, Mr. C. Morris
 ran the Sunday School and there were  
 large congregations. In the 1950's    
 numbers grew very small and the Chapel
 was faced with closure, but Mr. A.    
 Finch acted as lay preacher.          
 Presently, the Chapel has 24 members. 
 The Minister is Rev. P. Muff who also 
 serves two Chapels in Gloucester. Two 
 services are held each Sunday at 11.00
 a.m. and 6.30 p.m ( 3.30 p.m. in the  
 winter months ). A Sunday School is   
 held each Sunday morning with 12      
 children. Fund_raising events and a   
 monthly Fellowship meeting are held.  
 Highleadon Chapel closed in 1983.
