		<title>12Industry in Wootton Bassett</title>
		<content>        {The St.Ivel Creamery}         
 This is the largest factory in Wootton
 Bassett. The dairy has been in Wootton
 Bassett since 1913. Recent investment 
 of Â£25 million has expanded the       
 factory and doubled employment to 520 
 people producng yogurt(250,000 pots   
 per day),cottage cheese,cream,desserts
 and bottled milk. Farmers in a 20 mile
 radius send a total of 100,000 gallons
 of milk daily to be processed. This   
 involves tankers visiting about 350   
 farms. Dairy products are distributed 
 by road and Wootton Bassett's nearness
 to the M4 &amp; M5 motorways is one reason
 why St.Ivel have expanded in the town.
 Ten years ago almost all the workforce
 lived in Wootton Bassett but now about
 half commute from the Swindon area.   
 Most of the workers are female. The   
 factory has a shift system and works  
 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.     </content>
