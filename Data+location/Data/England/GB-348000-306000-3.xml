		<title>03Norton Sand Quarry,Condover.</title>
		<content>    The Norton Sand Quarry was taken   
 over by the Amey Road Stone Corp. in  
 1982 and is expected to be worked out 
 in about 18-20 years time,when it may 
 become a fishing or boating pool.In   
 order to obtain planning permission   
 ARC had to agree to screening.The     
 earth was dug up into great big mounds
 all the way round the quarry,so that  
 nobody can see the buildings.At the   
 moment it covers about 10 acres.      
    They cannot drain it,as the water  
 authority have a bore hole nearby,and 
 if the water was pumped out the bore  
 hole would dry up .There are eight    
 people who work there.The sand and    
 gravel is extracted from a pool ten   
 metres deep by a grab on a pontoon    
 (See photo C).It is then sorted into  
 three grades of gravel and two of     
 sand.
