		<title>04KNIVETON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Kniveton School is not very big.At the
 moment there are 33 children in       
 school,17 of those being Infants and  
 the others juniors.                   
 The children who come to the school   
 live mainly in the village but some of
 them come quite a long way from       
 different farms,and one or two are    
 brought in from other areas by their  
 parents.                              
 There are two full time teachers and  
 one part-time teacher who comes for   
 two half-days.There is a secretary who
 works for two mornings,an ancillary   
 worker who comes in for two afternoons
 to help with the very young children. 
 There is also a cook who prepares the 
 meals,and a midday supervisor.There is
 also a part-time caretaker who comes  
 in every morning and evening.
