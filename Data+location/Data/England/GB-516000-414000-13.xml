		<title>13A Day at School</title>
		<content> When I wake each morning I put on     
 my nightcoat and go downstairs for my 
 breakfast.At 8.30 I leave for school  
 with  my little sister.She goes to the
 Infants and I go to the juniors       
 where I wait for my best friend at    
 the gate. When Mr.Simpson has blown   
 the whistle I go inside and change my 
 shoes then I rush to get out the hymn 
 books for assembly.                   
 After assembly we have our lessons    
 until playtime (10.30) and after 20   
 minutes we come into the class again  
 until 12.00 and then we have our      
 lunch. Some people go home, some bring
 sandwiches but most stay for a school 
 dinner. Playtime in the afternoon is  
 from 2.30 until 2.45 and at 3.45 we go
 home.l go to bed at about 8.00 each   
 evening.
