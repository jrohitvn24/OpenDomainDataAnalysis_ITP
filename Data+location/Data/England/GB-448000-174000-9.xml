		<title>09Entertainment:World's End</title>
		<content> There is not much chance of           
 entertainment in this area as it is   
 essentially a rural area where farming
 prevails. From the World's End area it
 is about 5 miles to Newbury,and 15-20 
 miles to Reading. These are the       
 nearest places of entertainment. There
 is a "Friendship Circle" which takes  
 old people to places of interest. The 
 church in Hampstead Norreys is quite  
 well known and is well supported by   
 fetes. There used to be Guides and    
 Scouts in the area but there are now  
 only Cubs.                            
   There are two pubs in the area. They
 are both on the old A34 and have an   
 area for children.                    
    However for proper entertainment   
 one must journey outside the area.
