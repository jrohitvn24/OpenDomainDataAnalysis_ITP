		<content> As in most villages entertainment is  
 provided by the villagers.            
 The main event is the "pantomime".    
 Every year a group of enthusiastic    
 villagers get together and perform a  
 pantomime on a Friday evening and     
 Saturday afternoon and evening after  
 Christmas at the Eileen Wade School   
 and it is immensely enjoyed by        
 participants and audience. It seems   
 that each year key people move away,  
 but other enthusiastic newcomers are  
 encouraged to join in.                
 Many of the village clubs organise    
 events, mainly for fund raising but   
 also as social gatherings. The cricket
 club hold a monthly whist drive in the
 winter which is very popular. There   
 are occasional concerts in the church,
 using local talent.                   
 The Harvest Supper is a well supported
 social event.                         </content>
