		<title>04MURSTON LAKES</title>
		<content> Murston lakes originated from the     
 excavation of brick earth which was   
 used by the nearby brickworks. The    
 three freshwater lakes are an         
 important area for leisure for the    
 residents of Sittingbourne. They are  
 maintained as fishing lakes but they  
 support a wide variety of wildlife.   
 The surrounding area consists of a    
 small wood which is coppiced, many    
 bushes, scattered trees and reedbeds. 
 This provides dense cover for birds   
 and animals. Murston is an important  
 area for migrating birds which often  
 stop to feed. It also has a large     
 population of breeding birds both     
 resident and migratory. The           
 undergrowth is of great variety and   
 provides breeding places for many     
 butterflies. It is hoped that this    
 important area will be preserved for  
 future generations to enjoy.          </content>
