		<title>03FARM WORK IN 1985</title>
		<content>   Farm labourers work very hard and   
 for long hours without earning very   
 much money.  Many live in houses which
 belong to the farm so they cannot     
 change jobs or homes very easily.     
 Farm workers have to be able to handle
 complicated machinery such as sprayers
 for fertilisers and weed killers as   
 well as the huge combine harvesters.  
   Last year a new vegetable planter   
 was introduced.  This has cups like   
 ice-cream cornets which go round in a 
 clockwise direction.  As a cup passes 
 him, the man handling the machine puts
 in a young plant, which is then placed
 firmly in the ground.  There are four 
 sets of cups to each machine which is 
 pulled by a tractor.                  
   Potato and sugar beet harvesting is 
 also highly mechanised.  A scoop lifts
 the vegetables, tops them and loads   
 them onto conveyor belts for sorting. </content>
