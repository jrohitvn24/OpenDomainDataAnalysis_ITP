		<content>{Coastguard Service-}This is an        
 auxillary service and 20 men are      
 responsible for safety at sea along   
 the coast from St.Catherine's         
 Lighthouse to Atherfield.In           
 emergencies they co-ordinate the      
 following services-{1 Air Sea Rescue}-
 the helicopters from{Lee-on-Solent}   
 take approx 11mins to reach this      
 stretch of coast.{2 Yarmouth Lifeboat}
 - which takes approx 18mins to be in  
 operation here.100yrs ago there were 7
 full time coastguards but from 1975 it
 has been an auxillary service.When    
 there is an emergency the man on duty 
 at{The Needles}phones one auxillary   
 member who then phones another and in 
 this way the message is passed on.    
 Bleepers similar to those used by the 
 Fire Service will be introduced in the
 near future.
