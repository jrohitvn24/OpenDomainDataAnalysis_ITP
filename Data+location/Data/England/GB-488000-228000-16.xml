		<content> In{Stockgrove Park}most of the trees  
 are Deciduous such as Oak, Ash, Beech,
 etc. There are quite a lot of conifers
 as well. There is a lake there with a 
 stream flowing to Stockgrove Park     
 lake.{Shire Oak}was a big tree in the 
 middle of Map Ref.91,28. It was used  
 for separating the boundaries between 
 Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire and  
 in the past it was used as a meeting  
 place for local grievances. On the    
 24th-27th May 1985 the Shire Oak      
 was blown down in a gale.The animals  
 that live in the woodland are Grey    
 Squirrels,Rabbits,Deer,Fox,Mice,Woodpe
 cker,Owl and other birds.There are    
 lots of Fox and Rabbit holes. The     
 ground is mostly hilly but some is    
 flat. Most of the ground is           
 covered with bracken and different    
 kinds of grasses.
