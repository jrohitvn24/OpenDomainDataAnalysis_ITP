		<title>08THE O.K. CAFE'S DAY.</title>
		<content> The owner of the O.K. Cafe gets up at 
 5:45 a.m.and starts serving customers 
 at 6:30 a.m,finishing at 9:30 a.m.She 
 has been doing this job for four and a
 half years.The food is always fresh   
 and includes eggs,bacon,sausages,and  
 bubble and squeak.At 11:30 a.m  she   
 starts serving dinner;items such as   
 meat pie,sausages,vegetables and      
 casseroles.She does a lot of cooking  
 in the morning; making pastry,        
 cakes,flans, etc she uses a big heavy 
 duty electric mixer for pastry.Dinners
 are served until half past two and    
 then she looks after her little       
 girl.The menu will always be varied   
 for customers.If somebody wants  beans
 instead of sausages for example,then  
 this is arranged .All the vegetables  
 are cooked in the morning and then the
 meals are put in the microwave oven as
 they are required.                    </content>
