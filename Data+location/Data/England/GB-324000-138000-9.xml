		<content> I belong to a music club in           
 Cannington. It is called the          
 Cannington Children's Orchestra.It is 
 run by two music teachers.One is a    
 piano teacher and the other teaches   
 the violin.Here is a list of the      
 instruments in the orchestra:         
 Flute,Clarinet,different              
 sizes of Recorders,Violins,Chime Bars 
 and Piano.We meet on a Thursday at    
 school at 5.30pm for one hour.Our     
 latest piece is called "Winter".My    
 favourite piece is called "The Old    
 Woman and the Pedlar".In October we   
 are playing in the Taunton Music      
 Festival.Then nearer to Christmas we  
 are playing to people at school for   
 the Parent Teacher Association.
