		<content>{06.30}The baby wakes up for a feed.   
{07.00}Wash and prepare the breakfast. 
 Give the baby his cereal. Wash up the 
 dishes and get dressed.               
{08.30}Make the beds &amp; take the girls  
 to school. Collect Family Allowance.  
{09.00}Go and pick up my friend to shop
 in Crowborough &amp; have a cup of coffee.
{10.50}Go home &amp; unpack the food. The  
 baby sleeps while I prepare lunch.    
 Usually I get something from the free-
 zer. If it's sunny I sit outside and  
 knit until the baby wakes. Feed him   
 then 'whisk' the vacuum cleaner round.
{14.45}Watch the girls swim at school. 
{15.50}Home from school. We have a cup 
 of tea and biscuits.

{17.50}Organise Weds. dinner. Put load 
 of washing in machine before watching 
 T.V. after children are in bed.
