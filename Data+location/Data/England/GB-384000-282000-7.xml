    Each year, on a Saturday in May,   
the High Street of Kinver is closed to 
all vehicles for the country fayre.    
All the traders and organisations in   
the village put up stalls.             
     Many stalls sell food. The school 
parents association made pancakes.     
Others are side shows where you can try
your luck to win a prize.              
     There are bands and morris        
dancers. This year there was a display 
of old bicycles. The fire brigade bring
their engine for children to sit in.   
     Visitors come to the Fayre from   
all over the West Midlands.
