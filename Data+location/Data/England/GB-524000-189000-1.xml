		<title>01FINCHLEY IN GENERAL</title>
		<content> This area is easily identifiable by   
 three place names, North Finchley,    
 East Finchley and Finchley Central    
 (formerly Church End).                
 The block as a whole contains many    
 interesting places, many of historical
 significance. Despite no mention in   
 the original Domesday Book, there is  
 evidence of a Norman Church in the    
 area. In days gone by the area was    
 able to boast numerous celebrated     
 persons in the area especially from   
 the court of the riegning monarch.    
 Today Finchley's claim to fame is     
 probably the sitting MP, Mrs Margaret 
 Thatcher the first Lady Prime         
 Minister.                             
 There are currently many changes      
 occurring in the area both people and 
 building wise, and there is the usual 
 degree of controversy within the area 
 over such changes                     </content>
