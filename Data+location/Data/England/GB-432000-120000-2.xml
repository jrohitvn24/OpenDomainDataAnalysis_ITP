		<title>02BROADLANDS - ROMSEY</title>
		<content> The present house at Broadlands is a  
 fine 18th century palladian mansion   
 begun in 1767 by the 1st Viscount     
 Palmerston.  The work of landscaping  
 the 400 acres site was started by     
 William Kent and later Capability     
 Brown under the direction of the 2nd  
 Viscount Palmerston.  The old Jacobean
 Manor house was encased in white brick
 with fine porticos and entrance hall  
 designed by Henry Holland.  Robert    
 Adam supervised much of the interior  
 of the house.  The late Edwina Ashley 
 married the late Earl Mountbatten and 
 Broadlands became their family home   
 where they entertained many Royal     
 visitors.  The house was opened to the
 public in 1979 and after Earl         
 Mountbatten's assassination in the    
 same year, the present owners are Lord
 and Lady Romsey.
