		<title>20Brizlincote Valley * Credits</title>
		<content>     Near our school is a small valley 
through which runs the Brizlincote     
Brook.   At the moment many houses are 
being built where the fields were.     
Some of the children at our school live
in them.   People who live in the area 
tried to stop the building, but        
although not so many houses are now    
going to be built, there are still     
going to be a lot.   People have to    
live somewhere, but do they have to    
build houses in one of the most        
pleasant parts of Burton.
