		<content>  Our block is well provided for in    
 the form of parks and recreation      
 grounds, having a park, a country     
 park and a number of recreation       
 grounds.                              
 The Golf Course is in the north west  
 of our block off Manchester Road. The 
 club has 470 members on its books     
 which includes 60 juniors. The land   
 used to be owned by Lord Derby. The   
 professional in 1920 was Harry Varden 
 and he was the only person ever to win
 the British Open Championship six     
 times.                                
 The Bowling Green is off Hollins Lane 
 and is very popular with the locals.
