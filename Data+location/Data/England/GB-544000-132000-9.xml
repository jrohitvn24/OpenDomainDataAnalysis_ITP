		<title>09LEISURE IN ASHDOWN FOREST</title>
		<content>   Ashdown Forest provides a lovely    
 setting for rambles, birdwatching and 
 all activities associated with nature.
   For the energetic there is Coleman's
 Hatch Cricket Club and the Bowls Club.
 Both grounds are on the Forest, in    
 beautiful surroundings.               
   The Horticultural and Sports Society
 holds a yearly show, with races and   
 entertainment for children, and       
 showing of flowers and vegetables, and
 raising of money for charity.         
   The Hartfield Singers practice in   
 the Church Hall, giving concerts twice
 yearly.                               
   Bell ringing flourishes, as does the
 Mother's Union and Womens Institute,  
 taking keen interest in countrywide   
 affairs.  A yearly gymkhana is held   
 and the History Group regularly brings
 the past to life. Anything you want to
 do is possible in this community.     </content>
