		<title>08BIRDS IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> The most common birds in The Sampfords
 are the Sparrows and the Woodpigeons.A
 Kingfisher has been seen every year by
 the River Pant but it has not been    
 seen this year yet.The most beautiful 
 birds in The Sampfords are the        
 Kingfisher,the Mallard Drake and the  
 Cock Pheasant.The biggest bird is the 
 Grey Heron.In Gt. Howe Wood there are 
 lots of little owls and some Tawny    
 owls.Barn owls are quite rare but     
 there are some in the district.Also in
 Gt. Howe Wood there is a              
 Nightingale.This was heard by some    
 village people.On our school bird     
 table we have had two rare            
 visitors.These are the Reed Bunting   
 and the Coal Tit.They came for the    
 food that we put out daily.
