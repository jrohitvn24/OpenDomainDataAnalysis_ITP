		<content>In Collingtree the 22nd of June we had 
an Antique Fair and a Fish and Chip    
Disco.Some of the children were helping
 the games.The games we ran were: The  
Treasure Hunt,Car Game,Money in the    
Pot,Guess the Sweets in a jar,Throw the
Welly! and Knocking down the can.in    
Milton there was a May Day.            
  A May Day celebration is a wooden    
pole with colourful ribbons on it.Then 
children skip round the pole weaving   
the ribbons.The children skip round one
way to weave it and the otherway to    
unweave it.Also there was a procession 
had bands and floats.The Guides and the
Brownies dress up as funny characters. 
The people who watch the procession    
sometimes thron money for charity.All  
the money which is collected might go  
towards the "SAVE THE CHILDREN" fund or
an old peoples home.
