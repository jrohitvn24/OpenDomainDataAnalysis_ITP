		<content> The local farms depend largely on     
 wheat and barley, although the steeper
 slopes in the valleys, which cannot be
 cultivated, support dairy cattle and  
 some sheep.                           
 The monoculture of cereals occurs     
 despite the thin and stoney soils on  
 the Cotswold limestone and depends on 
 artificial fertilisers to maintain    
 soil fertility. Such is the           
 predominance of cereals that the      
 massive fields on the dip slope can   
 create a rather monotonous landscape. 
 Certainly this is the appearance of   
 the area from the Ermin Way.          
 Within the small valleys, however, the
 landscape is more varied and therefore
 more attractive. Here there are many  
 patches of woodland, both natural and 
 artificial, the largest of which is   
 Shewel Wood, S.E. of Elkstone.
