		<title>16Farming in our 'D' block</title>
		<content>  Most of the farming in our area is   
 arable and also a little dairy        
 farming.                              
  The  crops  grown are mostly cereals.
 Cereal crops are wheat, barley and    
 oats.We have seen all these.In the    
 spring some of the fields are bright  
 yellow with oil seed rape.            
  We have eight farms in our area.They 
 are the following:-Bullsland Farm     
 (sq.2),Ashwells Farm(sq.5),Longlane   
 Farm and Woodoaks Farm(sq.8),Skippings
 Farm(sq.9),Brawlings Farm,Roberts Farm
 and Tubbs Farm(sq.10).The remaining   
 squares(1,3,4,6,7,11&amp;12)have no farms.
  When the{M25}was built in the area   
 some farmers lost some fields to let  
 the Motorway through.                 
  Most of the animals in our area are  
 cows but some farmers also own horses,
 sheep and goats.                      
                                       </content>
