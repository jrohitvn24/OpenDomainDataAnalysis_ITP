		<title>19BAKER'S HOLE</title>
		<content> Baker's Hole is a dis-used quarry,    
 consisting of 30.35 hectares. It is   
 being filled in with industrial and   
 domestic waste. It will take          
 approximately 7 years to fill and a   
 further 2 or 3 years to restore to a  
 natural setting.                      
 The machines used on this project are:
 compactors; tracked loading shovels,  
 and dumper trucks. It has cost half a 
 million pounds for this machinery and 
 Â£200,000 per annum for their fuel.    
 In an effort to keep pests away, the  
 area is sprayed, whilst birds of prey.
 Rats are controlled by poisoned baits 
 put down by a contractor.To eliminate 
 smells the dump has to be covered     
 every day with at least 6 inches of   
 sand &amp; soil.                          
 The rubbish comes from Dartford,      
 Gravesend, and Sevenoaks.
