		<content> Galloway  Street  Leisure  Gardens are
 located in an  area  of  old, terraced
 houses. Originally the site had empty,
 derelict houses on it.  They were very
 frequently vandalised and often nearby
 tenants had to be evacuated in case of
 fire.  In 1977 the Council knocked the
 houses down, but then  the site became
 a dumping ground for rubbish.         
 Some local residents, with the support
 of their M.P.,  Mr David Alton,  asked
 for the land to be used as allotments.
 After two  or three years the  Council
 granted  permission  for  the  Gardens
 to be built  for  the benefit  of  the
 community.                            
 The  land  is  divided into twenty-one
 plots,  each with a licence  renewable
 yearly. Fruit and vegetables are grown
 for home use or to give away.  Flowers
 are grown and given to the old people,
 who also visit the Gardens.           </content>
