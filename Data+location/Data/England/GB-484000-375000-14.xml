		<title>14Arable Farming Hardwick area</title>
		<content> There is a variety in size and output 
 in the majority of farms in this area.
 Two of the main farms have areas of   
 285 and 600 acres including buildings,
 woods and homestead. The smaller one  
 has one permanent employee beside the 
 farmer. Casual labour is taken on as  
 needed i.e. for harvesting, lambing   
 and dipping. The larger farm has four 
 permanent employees. Cereals and sugar
 beet are the major crops on the clay  
 areas with some rape (for rapeseed    
 production), potatoes and peas. Soft  
 fruit often occupies a small area of  
 the farm, strawberries and raspberries
 growing well on the sandy soil. Some  
 farmers grow vegetables for people to 
 buy direct, after the Pick-your-Own   
 fruit season. Courgettes, peppers,    
 tomatoes, cucumbers, root, tuber      
 and brassica vegetables are popular.
