		<title>07FARMING KING'S NYMPTON</title>
		<content> The land is used for {mixed farming.  
{Cattle}and{sheep}are kept and a small 
 number of  pigs.The chief crop in this
 area is {hay }and{silage}which is used
 for winter feeding.Dairy and beef     
 cattle are reared. Recent E.E.C. milk 
 quota regulations have led to a       
 reduction in the number of dairy      
 cows.Cereal crops are grown, much of  
 it being stored in a large grain store
 in a neighbouring parish.Feeding      
 methods for cows at Great Lightleigh  
 Farm are linked with a computer system
 -each milking cow wears a neckband    
 with a transponder.As the cow enters  
 the feeding stall thetransponder emits
 signals which identify her.These are  
 relayed to the computer which controls
 the feeding supply in relation to the 
 milk yield. Farming is highly         
 mechanised and this has led to a      
 reduction of farm workers' jobs.      </content>
