		<title>15  Farm Work at Trevathan</title>
		<content> The work at the farm is done by the   
 farmer and his oldest son who         
{recently}left school.Most days start  
 with a walk around the farm{checking, 
 feeding and giving the animals water. 
 During the course of the day they go  
 into each field to check for any      
{disease}that is damaging the crops.   
 Then they go about maintaining the    
 farm.One of the two house cows is in  
 calf so their other cow is{hand-milked
 .Work is finished at any time in the  
 evening and starts at 7 to 8.00am.In  
 autumn the fields are ploughed. They  
 then prepare the ground and drill     
 it. Spraying and{fertilizing}comes    
 later. All the machines are housed to 
 save them from rusting.When needed the
 hedges are{rebuilt,}new gates are     
 fitted and ditches are cleaned out to 
 help fields drain properly.
