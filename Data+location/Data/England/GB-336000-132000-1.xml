		<content> The block is largely agricultural with
 the village of Middlezoy the main     
 residential area. Middlezoy is in the 
 County of Somerset and is 14 miles    
 from the County Town of Taunton. Other
 nearby towns are Bridgwater (6 miles) 
 and Street (8 miles).                 
 The name 'Middlezoy' derives from two 
 words, 'Middle' and 'Sowi'. 'Sowi'    
 means island in the marshland. This is
 a reminder that it is only recently   
 that this part of Somerset has been   
 made passable all the year round. In  
 times past, winter flooding almost cut
 off this area from the rest of the    
 country. The village is on the only   
 high ground and much of the           
 surrounding countryside is at or even 
 below sea level. This land is drained 
 by means of drainage ditches known as 
 'rhines' which criss-cross the land   
 and act as boundaries to fields.      </content>
