		<title>10NEW SHOPPING PRECINCT</title>
		<content> Swan walk is our local shopping       
 precinct. We interviewed some people  
 there. Most people shop for food at   
 Tescos and thought there was a good   
 variety of shops in the centre.       
 However, many thought it difficult to 
 use pushchairs because many shops are 
 too small. Marks and Spencer is a new 
 store in the precinct. Ms Sandra      
 Merlin, the assistant staff manageress
 said it took 18 months to build. The  
 site previously housed the local      
 theatre and there was much argument   
 about what should be in the precinct. 
 Marks and Spencer donated money       
 towards a new Arts Centre, which we   
 now have. Before coming to the town   
 the company researched the type of    
 shop people in the Horsham area       
 wanted. The store created 120 jobs.
