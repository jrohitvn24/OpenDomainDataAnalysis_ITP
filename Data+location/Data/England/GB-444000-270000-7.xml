		<title>07HOUSING IN THURLASTON</title>
		<content>Our area is fairly prosperous with a   
mixture of the old and new.The new     
houses,mainly privately owned,range    
from six to seven hundred years        
old.Many are quite large,with garages  
and gardens and are made of brick.Most 
are well established and looked        
after.Many have names instead of       
numbers.In Thurlaston,Cawston and Toft 
older buildings have often been        
reconverted from practical village use 
to residential dwellings.Malt House is 
one which also has a cob wall.Farm     
buildings are scattered through        
the area,a few are desolate but most   
have out houses and some farming       
activity.People seem to settle in the  
area rather than moving on.
