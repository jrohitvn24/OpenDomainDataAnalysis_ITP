		<content> This is a{Rudolf Steiner Home School  
 for{emotionally disturbed}children of 
 6-19 years of age and an IQ of 75-95. 
 The aim is to develop their human     
 qualities and to lead a normal life as
 far as possible. The children often   
 have no parents, are slightly retarded
 and suffering mental disorders, but   
 have the ability to function in a     
 classroom situation.                  
   A class teacher has a child for the 
 first eight years trying to bring its 
 nature into harmony by the            
 co-ordinating of head, heart and hands
 in all subjects. Religion, arts and   
 crafts, music, drama, games etc. are  
 all important. A small farm with a    
 variety of animals and horses for     
 riding provides work experience. A    
 centre for 16-19 year olds provides   
 further education and training before 
 they take their place in society.     </content>
