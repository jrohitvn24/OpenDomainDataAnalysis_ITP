		<content> people today.The novels elevate the   
 role of women and stress the need for 
 education.The present church is{104}  
 years old,rebuilt since the {Brontes'}
 time but they would recognise the {   
{Services of 1662 Prayer Book}still in 
 use and many hymns.Some of their poems
 are now used as hymns.A normal Sunday 
 morning congregation would be 140 but 
 for special occasions like the{Bronte 
{Society}annual service would rise to  
 300.The{Rector}receives many          
 letters,complaints,requests for access
 to parish records which go back to{   
{1640,}and acts as a figurehead for the
 village as there is now no parish     
 council.The church is involved in much
 charity work but its main aim is still
 to go out in a loving and caring way  
 to bring the good news to the         
 community.
