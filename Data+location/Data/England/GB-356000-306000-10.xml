		<content>  There is no doctor in the area so    
 people have to go to the{GENERAL      
{PRACTICE}practice in Cressage which is
 1 mile away. Because it is in the     
 countryside the Doctor has to give out
 the medicines from his{DISPENSARY.}   
 This means acting as the chemist.     
  The nearest{HOSPITAL}is the one at   
 Wellington  or there is a causalty    
 department at Much Wenlock. For bad   
 accident's the main hospital is at    
 Shrewsbury which is 7-8 miles away.   
 The nearest{DENTIST}for people in the 
 area is at Telford although some      
 people travel to Shrewsbury.          
  In this block there are no centres   
 for health care so people have to     
 travel to the nearby towns to use the 
 services of the Shrpshire Area Heath  
 Authority.
