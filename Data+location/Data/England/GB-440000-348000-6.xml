		<content>  Lots of children know rhymes for     
 skipping, clapping, dipping and ball  
 games.(Dipping means deciding who is  
 "on" next or who is to be the next    
 chaser.) Here is one 1980's rhyme:    
     {Each Peach Pear Plum             
     {Out goes your very last chum.    
{                                      
{Skipping Rhymes                       
  Children often skip on their own or  
 in small groups. Here is an example of
 a skipping game. (The rhyme is said by
 the children while turning the rope.) 
{     All is together girls            
{     This is fine weather girls       
{     When it's your birthday          
{     Please jump in.                  
  (The children turning the rope say   
 the months of the year starting with  
 January and jump out on their         
 birthday)                             
                                       </content>
