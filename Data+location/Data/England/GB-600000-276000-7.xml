		<content>There are very few amenities and       
services in the area. However one      
amenity which crops up TWICE in this   
block, but which DOES NOT fit into any 
category in the amenity list, is a     
Village Hall! There is one in square 2 
and one in square 11. These village    
halls are used as meeting places for   
any club or organisation that wishes   
to  hire them; for parish and Parish   
Council meetings, for dances, discos,  
wedding receptions and any other events
taking place in the parish! The bus    
services counted passing through       
Hinderclay as 2, are 2 services per    
week, one to Diss and one to Bury St.  
Edmunds, on  each town's respective    
Market Day. With such restricted public
transport, most families have their own
transport in the form of a car.
