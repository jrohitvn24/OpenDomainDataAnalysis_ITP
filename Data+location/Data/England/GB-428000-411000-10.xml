		<title>10Bretton Country Park.</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 8th May eight of us went 
 to Bretton Park.We went in two cars   
 and followed a map.At Bretton Park we 
 met the warden and went into the      
 Information Centre. We looked at the  
 stuffed animals and the warden told us
 about them. Then we went on the nature
 trail, following the yellow arrows.The
 first thing we saw was a grey squirrel
 running across the path. It had a baby
 in it's mouth. Then we saw a tree with
 metal pieces in it.There were cows in 
 a field and cattle pen at the side of 
 the track. I could not stop looking   
 through the binoculars and I think I  
 spotted an old mine shaft in the      
 distance. Before we came to the end of
 the trail we saw an old chapel.
