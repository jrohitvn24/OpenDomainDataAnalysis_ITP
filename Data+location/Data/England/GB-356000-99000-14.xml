		<title>14Wild Flowers in Cattistock</title>
		<content> Wild flowers abound;  in springtime   
 snowdrops are massed in the woods,    
 followed by bluebells, which form a   
 carpet under the trees.  Primroses are
 increasing, cowslips are decreasing   
 and stunted;  violets, aconites and   
 wood anemones are scarce.  In early   
 summer road sides are white with cow  
 parsley, yarrow and meadowsweet.  Wild
 iris and marsh marigolds grow in the  
 boggy areas near the river.  On the   
 chalk downland rare orchids are       
 regularly seen.                       
 The many species of wild flowers - and
 garden flowers - support a great      
 variety of butterflies.  As well as   
 the more common Peacocks,             
 Tortoiseshells and Red Admirals, 1985 
 has been  a good year for the         
 Common Blue and Chalkhill Blue        
 butterflies.  The Cinnabar Moth is    
 also very common in the area.         </content>
