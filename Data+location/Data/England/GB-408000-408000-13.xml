		<title>13Housing in Meltham</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Meltham were    
 built of stone.The village spread with
 the rapid expansion of{David Brown's} 
 in the sixties when the large estate  
 at{Thick Hollins}was built.These newer
 type houses being of{brick and        
{pebbledash}differ somewhat from the   
 characteristic{Yorkshire stone}of the 
 village and the pre-war solid houses  
 of the{Calmlands and Wetlands}areas.  
 The majority of the people questioned 
 lived in semi-detached accommodation  
 with terraced houses a close second.  
 There were few bungalows in the area. 
 Detached housing appeared to be on    
 the increase with the large new       
 development at{Durker Roods.}Here the 
 building in{Yorkshire stone}continues 
 in keeping with the general character 
 of the district.
