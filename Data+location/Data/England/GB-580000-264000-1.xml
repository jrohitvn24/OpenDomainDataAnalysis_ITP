		<content>N.W. Bury St. Edmunds and District.    
This block is mainly arable, consisting
of large fields intensively cultivated.
More land is covered by a golf course. 
  The eastern part of the village of   
Risby is included. Once a small        
community round a green, it has        
increasingly become a dormitory.       
Westley, a village  with a population  
of 150 is also included. Here, round   
St. Mary's Church some very expensive  
houses have been built.                
  Northwest Bury St. Edmunds consists  
largely of post-1960 houses in         
tree-lined roads with grass verges and 
a good deal of open space. There are   
two trading estates with warehouses and
some light manufacturing. The block is 
bisected by the A45 trunk road and the 
railway.
