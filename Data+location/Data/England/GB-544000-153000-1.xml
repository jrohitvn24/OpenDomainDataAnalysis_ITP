		<title>01 ALL ABOUT OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is situated in the Vale of   
 Holmsdale and just to the South of the
 North Downs.The scource of the River  
 Darent which runs into the Thames near
 Dartford is around Westerham.         
   The area is mainly intensively      
 managed farmland with both arable     
 fields and dairy herds.There is also a
 lot of downland which provides good   
 walking country.                      
   The population is mainly centred on 
 Westerham but smaller communities live
 in both Brasted and Sundridge.Many    
 tourists visit the area not only to   
 see Chartwell and Quebec House but to 
 browse through the many antique shops 
 which now fill much of                
 Brasted,Westerham and Sundridge.      
  The building of the M25 has meant the
 area is less bothered by through      
 traffic.When the orbital motorway is  
 complete,it should be even less busy. </content>
