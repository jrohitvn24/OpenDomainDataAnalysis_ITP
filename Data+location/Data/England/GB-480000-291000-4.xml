		<content> The area is traditionally a fox       
 hunting country with certain hedges,  
 fences, fields and copses maintained  
 to facilitate the passage of hounds   
 and huntsmen and provide cover for the
 foxes.  The Fernie Hunt meet regularly
 in the area during the winter and the 
 Westerby Bassett meet to hunt the     
 hare. Medbourne maintains it's        
 customary summer church fete and a    
 party is held every Christmas time for
 the children of Drayton Parish at     
 their village hall. This topic would  
 not be complete without a mention of  
 the 'Bottle Kicking' which dates back 
 at least 500 years.This takes place in
 the fields between Medbourne and      
 Hallaton with combatants from the two 
 villages, plus helpers, scrambling to 
 carry a small keg of ale over their   
 own boundary line, usually emboldened 
 by a considerable consumption of ale. </content>
