		<title>03Tourism - Poldark Mine</title>
		<content>  Poldark mine was a prosperous tin    
 mine in the 1730s. The whole family   
 worked at the mine. The men who worked
 down the mine earned Â£1.40, the women 
 who hammered the tin to pieces earned 
 37p and the girls a bit less and the  
 boys who pushed wheelbarrows full of  
 tin earned 25p a month.               
         The mine stopped working      
 because of money problems and was     
 found again when Mr Young (the owner) 
 had workmen digging a place for a     
 compressor. They started digging a pit
 because they thought that it wouldn't 
 make as much noise if it was put in a 
 pit. When they were digging they      
 suddenly found the shaft and Mr Young 
 decided he would dig it out. When it  
 was dug out he decided to open it to  
 the public and now you can go down    
 through the mine, which is very       
 interesting.                          </content>
