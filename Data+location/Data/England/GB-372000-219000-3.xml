 Mr.Akerman owns 89.06 hectares of land
 which are covered with different kinds
 of fruit trees. Here are some names of
 fruit which he grows;                 
 Apples-Discovery,Worcester,Sunset,Spar
 tan,Egremont,Laxton's Fortune.        
 Plums- Blaisdon and Marjorie Seedling.
 Blackcurrants- Baldwin and Benlomond. 
   Blackcurrants are now picked by     
 machines.They are picked when matured 
 (end of July)and then stored.         
     Most of the fruit goes to markets 
 in the U.K.,but there are about 50    
 tons of blackcurrants surplus.        
    When they pick apples they put they
 put them in a bag which hangs down the
 front of the picker.18 years ago the  
 wages for a lady was 3 shillings 4    
 pence for a day's work.Nowadays       
 people are paid more.The fruit trees  
 are pruned after Christmas.           </content>
