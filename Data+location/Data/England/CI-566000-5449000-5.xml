		<content>   Jersey's population has almost      
{doubled}since 1939 to almost 80000 and
 this has brought major problems for   
 the major services.  The{water supply}
 in the early 1970s came from          
{reservoirs}supplemented in the height 
 of summer and the tourist season from 
 the{Desalination Plant}near La        
 Corbiere. There are only a limited    
 number of valleys in an island the    
 size of Jersey and some of the        
 remaining valleys were particularly   
 unspoilt in an increasingly built-up  
 environment.                          
                                       
   In 1975, the{Waterworks Company }   
 (then completely private but now with 
 some public representation) proposed  
 to flood a valley in the east of the  
 island.  As if to bear out the need   
 for this, the major{drought of 1976}  
 emphasized the summer supply problem. </content>
