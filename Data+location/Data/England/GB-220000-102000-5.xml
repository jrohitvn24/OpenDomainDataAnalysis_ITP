		<content> The facts that we have discovered are 
 that farms need to be large by local  
 standards-100-200acres,probably run in
 conjunction with a brother or some    
 relative,so not much labour is        
 employed:the owner and the family not 
 being included in this                
 category.However much machinery is    
 used or shared between family farms,so
 a variety of skills is necessary for  
 anyone working in agriculture:-skills 
 with machines,feed,crops and stock.   
    Generally farms were mixed emphasis
 being on dairy,beef and sheep;all     
 products sold through the usual       
 monopolies:-Milk Marketing Board,     
 local market or abbattoir and Wool    
 Marketing Board.
