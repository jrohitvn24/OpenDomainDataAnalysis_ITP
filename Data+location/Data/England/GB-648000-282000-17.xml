		<title>17Gymnastics Club</title>
		<content> Gymnastics is a popular sport for both
 girls and boys. I go to a gym club and
 our leotard is green and blue. Some   
 people start gym at only 3 years of   
 age and you can continue until you are
 about 25.                             
   At Wembley the medals are big but at
 clubs they are small.                 
   The floor mats are very soft so you 
 don't hurt yourself on hard things.The
 vault is difficult and you need a lot 
 of spring to do it properly.          
   In competitions you are normally    
 nervous and a bit worried in case you 
 fall off.                             
   The boys vault differently from the 
 girls. In gym training you have to do 
 press-ups, sit-ups, squat-thrusts and 
 other things.On the bar you do other  
 things. Gym is a good sport.
