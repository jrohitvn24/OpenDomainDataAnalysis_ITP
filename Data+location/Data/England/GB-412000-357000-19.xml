  {Wolfscote Grange}was originally used
 by{monks.}The latest part of the house
 was built in{1649.                    
                                       
   To avoid window tax many of the     
 windows were blocked up.  However, the
 present owners are in the process of  
{restoring the Grange}to its former    
 glory, which includes unblocking the  
{stone-mullioned windows,}and exposing 
 the{original oak lintels.             
                                       
   Because of its age and setting, and 
 because there are no telegraph poles  
 or electricity pylons to spoil the    
 view, the{Grange is now used in       
{historical television productions.}For
 instance 'The Mallens'and 'All for    
 Love'were both filmed at the Grange.  
   It is also a working farm.
