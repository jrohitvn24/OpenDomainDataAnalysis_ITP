		<title>18Farming in our Block</title>
		<content> Being a very rural block,farming plays
 a very important part in the          
 community.                            
 Most of the farms are on the small    
 side. There are a variety of types of 
 farming. The predominant one is dairy 
 and beef farming. The grass in our    
 area is very lush and is good for     
 grazing.                              
 After cows, sheep are the most popular
 livestock farmed in our area. Crops   
 are also grown,for example,potatoes,  
 mangles,swedes and turnips.           
 Most of the farmers are               
 conventional,using chemical           
 fertilisers and insecticides. However,
 the area does include one organic farm
 where none of these chemicals is used.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
