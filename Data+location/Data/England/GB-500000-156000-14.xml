 went to the Woking Leisure Centre, to 
 interview the Deputy Manager. I       
 discovered the following information: 
   The most popular sports are squash  
 and badminton. The age group that uses
 the Centre the most is the 25-35 years
 group. Probably women use the Centre  
 more than men, mainly because of the  
 big keep fit classes and aerobics.    
 Roughly 3500 people use the Centre    
 each month.                           
   Many famous sportspeople and        
 celebrities have been to the Centre,  
 such as Willie Thorn, Cliff Thorburn, 
 Jimmy White, who are all snooker      
 players. Also the world champion      
 squash player Jahangir Karn and       
 celebrities like Tommy Steel and      
 Jasper Carrot have visited the Centre.
 The Centre has been the venue for both
