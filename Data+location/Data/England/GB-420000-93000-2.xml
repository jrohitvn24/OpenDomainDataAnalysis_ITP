		<content>    This area is popular with tourists 
 and they stay at Naish Farm, Cobb's   
 Camp or in guest houses. In the summer
 time the roads are packed with holiday
 makers coming to see the tourist      
 attractions.                          
    Beaches are great tourist          
 attractions in this area, most popular
 is Highcliffe Castle beach, which gets
 very crowded during the height of     
 summer. Unfortunately most of our     
 beaches have weaver fish living on    
 them. Another unfortunate thing is    
 that the cliffs all along the coast   
 keep eroding and there is less sand.  
    The New Forest is only a few miles 
 away and tourists go to see the       
 ponies.                               
    The Sammy Miller Motor-Cycle Museum
 in New Milton is Europe's largest.
