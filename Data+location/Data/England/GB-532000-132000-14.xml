		<title>14FLORA IN THE HIGH WEALD</title>
		<content> In spite of intensive grassland fields
 common meadow and woodland flowers    
 abound in their season on uncultivated
 patches. In the spring hedgerows are  
 often bottomed by{anemones, primroses 
 and{bluebells,}woodland flowers which 
 have remained after the land was      
 cleared for farming. These are later  
 replaced by{hedge parsley, foxgloves, 
{honeysuckle}and{wild roses.           
   Moist acid soil and open glades in  
 woodlands consisting of deep rooted   
 trees like{oak,}are ideal sites for   
 rhododendrons. The mauve or lilac     
{rhododendron ponticum}introduced into 
 this country from Armenia and Asia has
 become well naturalised and is now    
 considered a weed nuisance in forestry
 plantations. Other species and{azaleas
 have now been extensively planted for 
 ornament in many of the gardens of the
 large houses.                         </content>
