		<content> ..introduced by Watt and the two blend
 well.                                 
      Speke Hall is full of interesting
 features  such  as  the  moulded  17th
 century ceiling of the great  parlour,
 priest     holes,     tapestries   and
 interesting furniture.  An Elizabethan
 stone bridge leads to the   "black and
 white" house and the courtyard.       
  The National Trust took over the hall
 in 1942, and it is administered by the
 Merseyside County Museums.Although the
 hall is still  surrounded by trees and
 parkland open to the public,    it now
 stands   on  the  edge  of   Liverpool
 Airport which causes some concern with
 the vibration of 'planes.  It is close
 to Speke Industrial Estate,as the city
 of  Liverpool has expanded towards the
 hall.
