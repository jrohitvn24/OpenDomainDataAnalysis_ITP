 idea of Ian Porteus.It was put into   
 action by Mathematical Education on   
 Merseyide in conjunction with Royal   
 Insurance.                            
   It consists of  7 different rounds,2
 are where you are given individul     
 questions,2 are where the first       
 person to buzz &amp; give the correct     
 answer gets 2 points;if they answer   
 it wrongly the other team can either  
 take a point or have a go for the 2   
 points themselves.There are also 2    
 music rounds,&amp; a round where you must 
 answer as many questions as you can in
 a minute.

 are recorded.This year our team took
