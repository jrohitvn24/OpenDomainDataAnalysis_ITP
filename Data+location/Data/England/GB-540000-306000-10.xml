		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PAUL</title>
		<content> The day begins with dad getting up at 
 6.15a.m. He wakes my brother Andrew   
 who delivers the village newspapers.  
 At 6.50a.m. dad takes mum a cup of tea
 and then she gets up. Mum does a few  
 household chores, then wakes me up. I 
 have breakfast and get ready for      
 school. Dad goes to work at 7.30a.m., 
 he works at Perkins a factory in      
 Peterborough. Mum goes to work at     
 8.40a.m., she is a homehelp to senior 
 citizens who are unable to help       
 themselves in their homes.            
 My brother and I return home at about 
 4.00p.m. and have a hot meal. We then 
 go to our different places of sport.  
 Andrew enjoys cricket and I enjoy     
 athletics and music. Dad returns home 
 at 6.30p.m. and at about 8.30p.m. we  
 all meet for a short chat and hot     
 drink before we go to bed.
