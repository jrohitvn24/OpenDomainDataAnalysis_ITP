		<content> In our "BLOCK" there is only St.James 
 Church at Thorpe Thewles.This is a    
 Church of England Church, run by a    
 vicar with three churches in his      
 parish. As well as Anglicans there are
 many Non-Conformists, particularly    
 Methodists and some Catholics.There is
 no sign of Asian{religions}owing to   
 the lack of Asiatic or Eastern people.
 It is apparent that only few people   
 attend church regularly and these are 
 mainly middle aged and elderly. Of    
 these several travel to the           
 neighbouring towns of Norton,Stockton 
 or Billingham to attend church. Young 
 people,between eleven to twenty, seem 
 to have no real religious{beliefs}and 
 the vast majority do not attend       
 church.
