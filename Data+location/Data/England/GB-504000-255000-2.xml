		<title>02Tilwick Manor</title>
		<content> To see Tilwick Manor you will have to 
 walk along footpaths through open     
 fields planted with wheat and rape.   
 Sheltering on the edge of Tilwick Wood
 is the ruined Manor House. We do not  
 know exactly how old it is, but it was
 definitely built before 1694. The     
 walls are made of wattle and daub and 
 through the ages they have been       
 repaired with cement and bricks. The  
 Manor House has a thatched roof with  
 lots of black beams to support it. It 
 has two red brick chimneys. One is    
 enormous.                             
 Inside the house the floorboards are  
 not very safe and the walls are       
 crumbling. There are two very small   
 outside doors. The house has not been 
 occupied since the 1960's. Outside    
 parts of the old moat can still be    
 seen.
