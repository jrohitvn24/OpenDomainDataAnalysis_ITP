		<title>12LAND RECLAMATION</title>
		<content> At Bulwer Avenue in St.Sampson's a    
 large reclamation project has taken   
 place in recent years.Land has been   
{reclaimed from the sea}as a means of  
 providing more industrial sites.  A   
 large baling plant was set up behind  
 the fuel tanks, and from July 1982    
 until Spring of 1985{household refuse 
 was baled and used to infill an area  
 enclosed by a 460 metre long wall.    
 Approximately 210,000 lorry loads of  
 household refuse was baled, and       
 a total of 100,000 tons of stone was  
 used. It is hoped to use this         
 reclaimed area for the{ship building  
 industry as they hope to install a    
 slipway there to launch the new boats 
 straight into the sea from the        
 factory.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
