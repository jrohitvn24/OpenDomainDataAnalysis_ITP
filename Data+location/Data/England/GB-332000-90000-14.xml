		<title>14WOODROFFE BOARDING AT LYME</title>
		<content> There are three boarding houses at    
 Woodroffe school.                     
 All the girls who board live at Rhode 
 Hill, an old manor house. Rhode Hill  
 is about 1.7 miles from the school.   
 The girls walk to and from school.    
 The boys in years 1 to 4 live at      
 Harcombe House. They travel by coach  
 to and from school. Harcombe used to  
 be the girls residence until 1969.    
 The senior boys, in years 5-7, live at
 St.Andrews, which is very close to the
 school.                               
 Each House Master is a teacher at the 
 school and at least 8 staff from      
 school either live at or work at the  
 boarding houses as boarding house     
 staff. There are 150-200 boarders at  
 this state comprehensive school.
