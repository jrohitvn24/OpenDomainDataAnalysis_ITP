 girl from Whipton Barton Middle       
 School.6.30 Wake up.8.55 Get up! Have 
 breakfast with the family.We do not go
 to Church because Mum and Dad have too
 much to do.I play with my cat, bounce 
 my balls or read until 1.00 when it is
 dinner time.We had roast turkey,      
 yorkshire pudding,potatoes and        
 peas.Watched a farming programme on   
 T.V.Mum washes up while I play a game 
 or watch 'Eastenders' on T.V.We all   
 wash and change and pack into the     
 car to visit Grandma at Pathfinder    
 Village. We sit in the garden by her  
 mobile home and watch the pigeon with 
 a broken wing.He'd had a fight!After  
 tea of Tuna,bread and butter, cheese  
 and cake I doze in a chair. 9.00 Time 
 to go home. After a drink and a wash I
 am in bed by 9.30. Goodnight!
