		<title>02MY HOUSE</title>
		<content> My house is about 200 years old.It    
 used to be two semi-detached houses   
 but when the owners of one of the     
 houses died it was turned into a farm 
 which kept cows and pigs.The pigshed  
 is now used for storing wood.We still 
 have plenty of our own pets.          
 Our house has got twelve rooms which  
 are all in use.Some people say that   
 our house was once a{pub.}Next to our 
 house there is a hill named {BULL HILL
 .It was once used as a sand pit,but   
 now it has been left to grow wild.Cows
 and Sheep now graze there.            
   My Dad works for{British Telecom}in 
{Ashbourne}and my Mum works in the     
 house.
