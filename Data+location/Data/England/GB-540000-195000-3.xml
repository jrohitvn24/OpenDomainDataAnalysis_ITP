		<content> A survey of 12 yr. old pupils revealed
 the following features about the      
 development of the{community.}The vast
 majority, about 85%, were born        
 locally: most at St.Margaret's        
 Hospital, Epping, and a few at home or
 in Harlow.{Parents}generally were born
 in the East End of London with a      
 smaller proportion from North London. 
{Grandparents}were drawn from a much   
 wider area, but with a prepoderance   
 from the London region. This migration
 over three generations, suggests      
 increasing{affluence}coupled with     
 accessibility to London, and the      
 surviving connection, albeit now      
 tenuous, with the East End.All replies
 noted the development of supermarkets,
 and a significant number noted the    
 library/swimming pool complex. Local  
 celebrities again reflect affluence   
 and the proximity to London.          </content>
