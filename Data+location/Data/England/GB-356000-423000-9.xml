		<content> MY DAD, MR BARNES, WORKS AT PAUL'S    
 AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL FEED AT WALTON    
 SUMMIT. HE STARTS WORK AS A LORRY     
 DRIVER AT 6.30AM IN THE MORNING, BY   
 LOADING HIS LORRY AND SETTING HIS     
 TACHOGRAPH, WHICH RECORDS HOW LONG HE 
 DRIVES, THE SPEED OF THE LORRY AND ANY
 STOPS HE MAKES. THIS IS REQUIRED BY   
 LAW. HE DELIVERS ANIMAL FOODS TO MANY 
 AREAS INCLUDING CUMBRIA,DUMFRIES AND  
 PENRITH AS WELL AS FAIRLY LOCALLY. HIS
 LORRY IS KNOWN AS A "SUCKER-BLOWER"   
 WHICH MEANS THAT IT CAN SUCK IN FEED  
 AND ALSO BLOW IT OUT AT THE DELIVERY  
 POINT. HE CARRIES A WIDE VARIETY OF   
 ANIMAL FEEDS FOR BOTH CATTLE AND      
 POULTRY. WHEN HE ARRIVES BACK AT THE  
 MILL HE GIVES HIS MILEAGE READING TO  
 THE OFFICE AND THEN, IF HE HAS THE    
 TIME, LOADS HIS LORRY FOR THE NEXT    
 DAY'S WORK.I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH  
 HIM WHEN I AM OLDER.                  </content>
