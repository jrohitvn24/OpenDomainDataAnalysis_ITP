		<title>15MOBBERLEY OLD HALL</title>
		<content>      This fine old house was built in 
 1612 by Robert Robinson a clothier of 
 Manchester but the distinctive and    
 numerous outbuildings were not        
 completed until 1686.  The house has  
 mullioned windows, and three rooms are
 panelled in oak.  The main staircase  
 is of oak, and there are five         
 staircases in the house and no        
 passages, most of the rooms lead out  
 of each other.                        
      The well and pump are still by   
 the house and were used till a public 
 water supply came to Mobberley in the 
 1920's.                               
      Mr. Ernest Leycester owned and   
 lived at the Old Hall for 20 years    
 until 1914.  He planted many trees and
 designed the bowling green and        
 surrounded the garden with yew hedges.
 The hall is now owned by Manchester   
 University.                           </content>
