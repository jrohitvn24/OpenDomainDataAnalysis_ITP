		<content> The open landscape has been described 
 as "arable desert".Although a line of 
 ancient oak and ash woods (including  
 Hanger, Astey, Kempston and Ransom's  
 woods) do remain,trees have been lost 
 in the area through enlargement of    
 fields and removal of hedgerows and   
 roadside trees.Elm was the most common
 hedgerow tree but has been lost       
 through disease.The oak and ash       
 remaining suffer "die-back" due to    
 farming pracices of cultivating too   
 near the roots,drainage, chemicals and
 straw burning.                        
 Remaining trees are important and many
 trees around Stagsden West End have   
 Tree Preservation Orders.Some         
 replanting has occured;the County     
 Council and private landowners have   
 planted some trees e.g.at Ducksworth  
 (to replace those lost due to road    
 improvements)and Stagsden West End.   </content>
