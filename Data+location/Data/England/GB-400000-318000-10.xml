		<title>10Our Area 40 Years Ago.</title>
		<content>40 years ago our school was farmland   
owned by the farms, one at the top and 
one at the bottom. There were a few    
houses in Green Lane. There was Lisa's 
street called Jubilee Street and       
Sarah's street called Park View        
Terrace. There was a footpath starting 
at Wolseley Road going through the     
fields to Fortescue Lane. There were a 
few houses going down Wolseley Road.   
The sewage works was a Prisoner of War 
Camp for the Italians. After the war it
was a Resettlement Camp for people from
other countries. Etching Hill was      
nearly all farmland. The Wolseley Arms 
Inn was called the Roebuck Inn. The    
canal bridge at Wolseley Bridge was a  
hump backed bridge. The main A51 road  
was not so busy and traffic did not    
travel so fast. The railway trains were
all pulled by steam locomotives and    
there were working boats on the canal. </content>
