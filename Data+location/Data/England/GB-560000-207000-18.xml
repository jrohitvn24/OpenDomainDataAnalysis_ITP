		<title>18NEWLAND HALL,ROXWELL</title>
		<content>     Newland Hall belonged to King     
 Harold.                               
     The house, which is very large,   
 stands by the left of the road which  
 leads from Boyton Cross into          
 Margaret-Roding about a mile from     
 Roxwell Church.                       
    Newland Hall was built early in the
 16th century. It was owned, in 1519,  
 by Margaret Gedge but half of it was  
 owned by Thomasine Gedge. On January  
 16th 1538 George Gifford had licence  
 to transfer one moiety to another man 
 called Richard Hales and later in 15th
 January 1540 to transfer a moiety to  
 Thomas Arnndell. But the estate still 
 remained in the Gedge family because  
 James Gedge had 3 daughters named Mary
 then 14, Joanne 13 and another Joanne 
 aged 10. In 1748 William Taylor was   
 the owner of Newland Hall and he was  
 later named William Taylor Howe.      </content>
