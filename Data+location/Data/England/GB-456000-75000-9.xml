 Burt's Brewery has belonged to the    
 Philips family since 1906. The present
 brewery was built after the original  
 was bombed during the War. Local      
 spring water provides the liquor for  
 the beer-making process. Malted barley
 comes from Stowmarket, Suffolk. The   
 liquid sugar comes from Manchester and
 the hops come from Kent. Yeast is the 
 other ingredient. In the summer about 
 7,200 gallons are brewed a week. The  
 beer is kept in vats for 5 days. 12   
 people work at the brewery and they   
 start work at 6 am. They make 2 kinds 
 of draught beer and 4 kinds of bottled
 beer. The brewery owns 11 public      
 houses and 2 shops. They have about   
 200 other customers including 3 on the
 mainland. The brewery won awards in   
 the 1960's and recently featured on   
 the T.V. programme 'The Islanders'.   </content>
