		<content> Princess Helena College was the first 
 academic school for girls.It was both 
 a day and boarding school and was     
 founded in 1820 to educate daughters  
 of Naval and Military officers who had
 died in the Napoleonic wars.The girls 
 were admitted at 14 and stayed until  
 they were 21.In 1879 Princess Helena, 
 third daughter of Queen Victoria,be-  
 stowed upon the school its present    
 title.A Royal Charter of Incorporation
 followed in 1886,the Queen declaring  
 it her will and pleasure that the     
 reigning monarch should ever be its   
 Patron.Princess Helena was associated 
 with the college from 1868 until her  
 death in 1923.In 1935,when the        
 premises in London grew too small, the
 governors bought Temple Dinsley,  an  
 18th century country house in Preston.
