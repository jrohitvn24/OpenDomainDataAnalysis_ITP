		<title>19The Community Policeman</title>
		<content> Our community Policeman has a beat in 
 the King's Wood area of High Wycombe.A
 beat is the area that he guards.He    
 often comes to school to see us and to
 tell us about dangers to look out for.
 His uniform is a black suit and blue  
 shirt. He has two kinds of hat - a    
 tall one and a flat one. The tall one 
 is so that people can easily see him  
 in a crowd.It is also hard so that it 
 protects his head.The flat hat is for 
 wearing in the car.He has a radio so  
 that he can communicate with the      
 police station.He has handcuffs to put
 round the wrists of bad people and he 
 has a truncheon to defend himself.He  
 carries a notebook to write down      
 evidence so that he can remember it   
 many months later. He told us that he 
 is a friend to all children and we    
 must always go to him if we need help.
