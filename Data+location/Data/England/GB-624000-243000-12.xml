a group of christians who came from    
Newbourne. The building is situated a  
mile and a half from waldringfield and 
is beside the Martlesham to Newbourne  
Road.  The Church serves the villages  
of Waldringfield, Bucklesham,Newbourne,
Brightwell and Martlesham. Regular     
services on a Sunday include Family    
Worship at 11am and 2.30pm.and a Sunday
School called "Discoverers" at 10.15am.
About 35 people attend regularly on a  
Sunday. Mid-week services include a    
Prayer and Bible Study on Thursdays and
a Fellowship of Youth for children and 
teenagers on a Friday.                 
The present Pastor lives at Kesgrave,  
about 4 miles away and apart from      
preaching at the main services he      
spends much of his time in preparation 
and visiting people in their homes or  
at the hospitals.                      </content>
