		<title>02STANWICK CAMP &amp; EARTHWORKS</title>
		<content>  Much  of  the    {ancient  earthworks
 forming  the {defence  system}  of the
{Brigante  tribe}who lived in this area
 between the{Roman invasions}of{55 B.C.
 and {43 A.D.} remain  clearly visible.
 They are extensive  and  the resulting
 enclosure  is  thought  to  have  been
 capable of  holding  the  entire tribe
 estimated at between {80 &amp; 100,000} in
 number.                               
  The length of the outward ramparts is
 8,070yards, of the outward works 3,183
 and of the internal works 2,334. Today
 parts stand up to 20feet in height and
 with the erosion caused through nearly
 2,000years of exposure to the weather,
 must originally have been much higher.
{ Excavation}work  {c.1848} revealed  a
 large number of horse trappings; metal
 bowls;bronze axes and spear heads;some
 embossed bronzes, one of which,a{water
{clock,}is now in the{British Museum.} </content>
