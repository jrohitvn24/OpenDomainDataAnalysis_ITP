		<content> The area surveyed by Class 4 of Saint 
 Philip's R.C.Primary School Uckfield  
 contained a variety of landscapes,    
 including woodland,farmland ,urban and
 rural.                                
    At the time of writing some of this
 farmland and woodland is soon to be   
 lost to major housing and industrial  
 development.Naturally many of the     
 local inhabitants are angry about     
 this. They are worried about          
 over_development and erosion of       
 greenbelt areas.                      
    Apart from fringe housing estates  
 of Uckfield the only residential area 
 surveyed was the village of Framfield 
 situated some 5km fromthe town of     
 Uckfield. Framfield is a pleasnt rural
 village that has successfully mixed   
 old world charm with a modern housing 
 estate. It seems particularly popular 
 with retired couples.                 </content>
