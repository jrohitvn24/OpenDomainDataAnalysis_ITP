		<content>      We prepared a questionaire and   
 using it intervewied a total of{25    
 people. We visited 4 seperate places, 
 in order to obtain a varied           
 cross-section of the people living in 
 the area.                             
      We first asked how often the     
 people used the Cornish Leisure World 
 at Carlyon Bay. 10 people said the    
 have never used it, 9 people used it  
 less than once every 6 months. 1      
 person said they went there about once
 every month, and another once every 2 
 weeks. 4 people went more often than  
 once every 2 weeks.                   
      The area does seem to be very    
 popular; 24 people said they liked the
 area; only 1 person said they did not,
 out of the people we asked.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
