		<title>15Ancient Churches and Plague</title>
		<content> The{Anglican church}in{West Kingsdown 
 sits in the middle of a heavily wooded
 area, some distance from the nearest  
 houses.  It is part{Norman}and clearly
 pre-dates all the housing for miles   
 around.  The major housing areas      
 within the village are all a way      
 removed from the church.              
                                       
 This feature is not uncommon in       
 villages in this part of Kent (see    
 Fawkham and Hartley to the north).  It
 is attributed to the effects of the   
{Black Death}or{plague,}wiping out the 
 original village clustered round the  
 church.  Where houses were unaffected 
 they were generally some way from the 
 church and thus from other habitation.
 When the village started up again it  
 was around those houses whose         
 occupants had survived.
