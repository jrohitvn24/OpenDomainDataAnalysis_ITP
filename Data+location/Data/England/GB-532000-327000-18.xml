		<title>18Working round Holbeach Bank</title>
		<content> A survey was conducted to find out    
 about employment around Holbeach Bank.
 It was found that most people are     
 involved in processing or growing food
 as this is a farming area. A lot      
 of vegetables are prepacked to be     
 sold in big shops. Out of 45 parents: 
          13 are food processors       
          6 are farmers                
          8 are housewives             
          2 are food merchants         
          2 are shops assistants       
          5 are builders               
          2 are lorry drivers          
          4 are teachers               
 One father is retired and there is a  
 vicar and a market stallholder. Not   
 many people are unemployed because    
 there are lots of jobs to be done on  
 the land. Gangs of workers go out to  
 do the work that cannot be done by    
 machines.                             </content>
