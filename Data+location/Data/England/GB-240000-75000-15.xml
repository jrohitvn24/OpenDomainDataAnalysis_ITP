		<content> Most of the area is farmed for dairy  
 and beefstock cattle but there are    
 many pockets of currently unmanaged   
 woodland and coppice, old mine work-  
 ings, steep river valleys, and miles  
 of Devon banks and hedgerow which     
 gives an abundance of undisturbed     
 habitat in which wild life can        
 flourish. The mild, wet climate and   
 lack of severe winters also encourages
 the growth of both animal and plant   
 life. Over the survey area, rabbits,  
 foxes,squirrels,weasels,stoats and the
 different varieties of rats,mice,voles
 and shrews can be found in larger     
 numbers. The shyer hedgehogs and      
 moles can also be seen and there is   
 reasonable badger population and      
 occasional feral mink.                
 Frogs, toads and newts use the quieter
 streams.
