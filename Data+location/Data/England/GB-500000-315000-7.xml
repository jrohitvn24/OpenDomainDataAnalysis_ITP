		<content> There are two Friesian milking herds  
 in our area (see next page), one on a 
 farm -largely outside our block- which
 also keeps pigs; several farms fatten 
 up one or two dozen beef cattle.      
  Three farms keep{Sheep.}One, with    
 about 370 crossbred "mule" ewes, a few
 pure Suffolk ewes, and 12 tups, prod- 
 uces 600 lambs for meat. The ewes are 
 tupped in October; lambs are born in  
 February and March and go to market   
 from the end of May onwards. Sheep,   
 dipped twice a year for scab and foot 
 rot, are sheared in June. Turnips are 
 grown to supplement their winter diet.
  Another farm has about 150 mules, a  
 few Suffolk/Border Leicester ewes and 
 5 Suffolk tups. About 260 lambs, born 
 in March/April, are sold in autumn.   
 The farm also rears 30-40 beef cattle,
 Hereford/Friesian cross or Charolais. 
  The third has a few Welsh Blacks.    </content>
