		<content>{ NUNWELL HOUSE }is a stately home     
 owned by Colonel and Mrs Aylmer.It was
 purchased from the Oglander family in 
 1982.It has 65 rooms,but only 34 are  
 in use.Mrs Mary Oglander has moved    
 into the renovated coachhouse.        
  Living in a stately home today is    
 very hard.Every year the house uses   
 Â£2000 of heat.The Aylmer family do a  
 lot of the house work themselves.3    
 mornings a week a cleaner comes to the
 house and 2 gardeners each come one   
 day a week.In the winter the Aylmer   
 family and guests have to wear coats  
 when having dinner,because it is very{
 cold.                                 
  To help with costs the house is open 
 to visitors and there is a cafe for   
 light refreshments.{King Charles}slept
 here on his last night before being   
 imprisoned.His equerry's room still   
 has the original panelling. {         </content>
