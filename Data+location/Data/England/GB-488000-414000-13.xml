		<content> Our questionnaires asked the people of
 Normanby what electrical appliances   
 there were in their homes.Out of 23   
 questionnaires returned everyone had a
 refrigerator and most people had a    
 washing machine.Not many people in    
 Normanby had a microwave or stereo    
 equipment.One house in Normanby had   
 everything,a refrigerator,video,      
 microwave,dishwasher,stereo equipment,
 colour T.V. and washing machine but no
 dishwasher.Only 3 people out of 22    
 sheets returned had a micro computer. 
 One of the families who had a computer
 had a BBC the other two have Commodore
 Vic 20 and Spectrum 48K. The three    
 people use educational programs more  
 than games. The children use the      
 computers the most. Everybody who     
 returned their sheets in Normanby does
 their main shopping in Scunthorpe.
