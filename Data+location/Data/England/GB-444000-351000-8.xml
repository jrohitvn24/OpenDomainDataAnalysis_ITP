		<content>  {HOT CHOCOLATE}- the best number of  
 players for this game is 10. One of   
 the 10 is chosen to be 'on'. He/she   
 has to stand with his/her face against
 a wall. The other players stand in a  
 line parallel to the wall about 20    
 feet away. These people have to try to
 get to the wall and touch it without  
 being seen by the person who is 'on'. 
   The person facing the wall can turn 
 round at will. When he/she does so,   
 the other players must stand perfectly
 still. If they are caught moving at   
 all then they must come and stand at  
 the wall and form a chain. This chain 
 can be released from the wall by a    
 touch on the last hand by any player  
 who is free.                          
   The game ends when all players are  
 captured and made part of the chain or
 when the person facing the wall       
 becomes tired of the game.            </content>
