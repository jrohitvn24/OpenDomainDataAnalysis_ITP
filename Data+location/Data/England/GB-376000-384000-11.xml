		<title>11RELIGION IN HALE BARNS.</title>
		<content>   Of all the places of worship in this
 Survey area it is peculiar that those 
 of Hale Barns are situated so close   
 together; typical of the ecumenical   
 spirit of the age. One group decided  
 to find out about the oldest          
 foundation ; that of{Hale Unitarian   
{Chapel}in Chapel Lane. The caretaker  
 told them that it was built in l723 as
{"The Presbyterian Meeting House"}to   
 house the dissenting congregation that
 was dispossesed of their occupancy of 
 Ringway Chapel. The chapel is notable 
 for its box pews and its fine pulpit  
 with sounding board. The congregation 
 pioneered education in the district   
 and provided its first day school in  
 l740. This building is on Hale Road   
 adjacent to the Unicorn Hotel. These  
 old, listed, buildings add character  
 to the suburb and are a proud symbol  
 of an active congregation.            </content>
