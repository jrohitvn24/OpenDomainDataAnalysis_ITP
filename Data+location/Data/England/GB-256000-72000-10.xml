		<title>10Dartmoor Prison Farm</title>
		<content> From our classroom window we have a   
 lovely view  across the prison farm.  
 It was started about a hundred years  
 ago to occupy the prisoners and to-day
 it covers about 1600 acres. On the    
 farm they have 800 ewes,300 beef cows,
 110 dairy cows,900 lambs and 3 horses.
  To look after all these animals and  
 to do all the other jobs about the    
 farm about  60 prisoners are employed 
 daily with 12 civilians and 9 or 10   
 prison officers. Once every year, in  
 October, they sell the livestock at a 
 market which is held on the farm. You 
 can hear the cattle mooing all night  
 at sale time. The beef cows are Blue  
 Greys and Galloways and the dairy cows
 are Friesians. The main produce from  
 the farm is beef and milk and they get
 about 300 gallons of milk a day. 223  
 gallons go to Ambrosia for milk       
 puddings, 50 gallons is used...cont'd </content>
