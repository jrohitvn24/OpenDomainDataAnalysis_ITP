		<content> Good community relations ensure that  
 there is never anyone in need of      
 transport.                            
 At least one car per family.          
 Nearest garage is 5 miles.            
 Bus Service - mainly school: one bus  
 to Richmond in morning and one bus    
 from Richmond in late afternoon, calls
 in at Marske village on weekdays only.

 running between Richmond and either   
 Leyburn or Gunnerside on the A6108
