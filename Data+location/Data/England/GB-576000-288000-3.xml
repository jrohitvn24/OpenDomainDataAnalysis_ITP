		<title>03WEETING VILLAGE  2</title>
		<content> Despite the mix of the population     
 there are several well supported clubs
 such as football, cricket and darts.  
 The fine village hall is the venue for
 the W.I., art exhibitions and disco   
 dances etc. The Bowls Club has its own
 green and pavilion. There are no med- 
 ical facilities, the nearest being in 
 Brandon and the nearest hospital in   
 Bury St. Edmunds. There is no library 
 but a mobile van calls regularly.There
 is a small local taxi service but as  
 usual the public transport is poor.The
 nearest railway station is at Brandon,
 otherwise bus services are catered for
 by private local firms. The old school
 house by the green is supplemented by 
 modern cabin classrooms for nursery   
 and primary schooling, older pupils   
 are bussed to Methwold.
