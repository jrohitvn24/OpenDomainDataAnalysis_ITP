		<content> Lodge Mill closed in its capacity as a
 textile mill in the early 1960's and  
 has since been sub-let as private     
 units for a range of service          
 industries. Of particular interest is 
 a firm making mainly lamp-stands, ash 
 trays etc. using onyx as a raw        
 material. This industry has grown from
 one man's interest and appreciation of
 the beauty of onyx from a holiday in  
 Italy, to a highly successful family  
 business.                             
    The owner travels to Pakistan in   
 order to select his onyx, which       
 normally arrives as 6 tonne           
 blocks. Imports also come from Mexico,
 via the port of Hull.                 
    The local 'soft' water is purified 
 using a tower and filler system but   
 the owner has also bought geese and   
 ducks to help keep the water clean.
