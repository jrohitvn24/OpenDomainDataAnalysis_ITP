		<content> When the town of Coalville grew up    
 around two coal mines,the area to     
 the NE remained as farmland with just 
 a few large houses.The ground in this 
 area is granite and there are no coal 
 seams.Because of mining subsidence in 
 the town people began building on the 
 granite.Houses have been built here by
 the Council,the East Midlands Housing 
 Association and by private builders.  
 There are a few small shops here,but  
 mostly people do their shopping in    
 Coalville.The service industries are  
 also in the town.There are plenty of  
 leisure activities in the area.The    
 three Churches have clubs for all age 
 groups;there are Scout and Guide      
 groups,two Youth Clubs and King Edward
 VII Community College which has a     
 swimming pool,playing fields and      
 evening classes for the local people.
