		<title>06POLING VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Poling is central for the Poling      
 Hundred.  In the Domesday Book this is
 called the Hundred of Rieberge        
 or Risberg. The name Pollinges first  
 appeared in 1166.                     
                                       
 Poling today is a village situated    
 south of the A27.  It grew as part of 
 Angmering, but did not exist as early 
 as the last Domesday in 1085.  In 1861
 the population was 203 and now it is  
 180.  Poling's name is typical of this
 area, being Saxon.  It has an acreage 
 of 923.                               
                                       
 The main characteristics of the       
 village are: nurseries, Perry Barn,   
 Westlands copse and a small Post      
 Office.  There was an old scholl which
 was built in 1866.  It is now used as 
 a house.
