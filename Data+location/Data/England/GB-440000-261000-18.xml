		<title>18Southam's Places of Interest</title>
		<content>  Two of Southam's most interesting    
 buildings have connections with the   
{Civil War.}These are the{Old Mint}and 
 the{Chemist's Shop.}The Old Mint is   
 now a public house and many visitors  
 are attracted to it because of its    
 antiquated appearance. It gets its    
 name from the fact that coins were    
 once minted there. Local tradition    
 suggests that Charles I had silver    
 cast into coins there after the{Battle
{of Edgehill.                          
  The Chemist's Shop used to be a Manor
 House where Charles I once slept. It  
 is an attractive half-timbered house  
 with an overhanging upper storey.     
  Outside the town is{Stoneythorpe Hall
 which has belonged to the same family 
 for over 300 years. In 1625 it was    
 rebuilt after a fire. The present     
 house has 18 rooms. Dutch elm disease 
 has destroyed the tree lined driveway.</content>
