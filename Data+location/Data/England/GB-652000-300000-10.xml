		<content> There were paddle steamers which were 
 used for pleasure trips. One called   
 the "United Service" travelled out to 
 sea in the summer &amp; during the winter 
 was used as a mud dredger.            
   Other pleasure boats took passengers
 from Gorleston to Great Yarmouth for  
 the fare of 6d (2.5p.) Small boys     
 would run along the shore trying to   
 catch them up &amp; when the journey had  
 finished they held out their hands for
 money from the passenages.            
    In the autumn there would be       
 hundreds of steam herring drifters    
 moored in either side of the river up 
 to the hourbours mouth. The Gorleston 
 lifeboat called the "Elizabeth        
 Simpson" saved over 500 lives &amp; never 
 capsized or lost any of her crew.
