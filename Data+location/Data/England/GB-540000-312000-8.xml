		<title>08DRAINAGE OF THE FENS</title>
		<content> In the early days, the{fens}were wild 
 and windswept,with some{farming}but a 
 lot more{wildfowling.}Newton's most   
 famous family from the past, the      
{Colviles,}helped to re-claim the area 
 from the sea. Sir Geoffrey was the    
 first Colvile to be appointed as a    
 commissioner of the sewers in 1314.   
 His responsibility was to continue the
 drainage work that nature had begun by
 providing deep rivers. Sir John       
 Colvile, who fought at the Battle of  
 Crecy, also became a commissioner.In  
 1335 he had to make some hasty repairs
 to the sea banks.Richard Colvile,     
 Simon Wood and others employed  Henry 
 Dereham of London to drain their lands
 so that a depth of one foot was dry.  
 In return for this work, Dereham was  
 awarded two-fifths of the land.
