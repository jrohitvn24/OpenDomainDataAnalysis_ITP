		<title>19WHITBOURNE SCHOOL TODAY</title>
		<content>{Whitbourne School}was built as a      
 charity school in the early 1800's.   
 Life in the school today is very      
 different from what is was a hundred  
 uears ago.Unlike other village        
 schools,our school is still growing.  
   In{mathematics}lessons we are       
 encouraged to do lots of practical    
 work using a variety of equipment.We  
 are helped in understanding the       
 subject rather than learning it by    
 heart.                                
  {Reading and writing}are more        
 interesting.Books are more colourful  
 and stories more exciting.            
   We do{science}in the primary school 
 today.This term some children have    
 been learning about spiders.First of  
 all they had to know where to find    
 them and go and look for them.Then the
 spiders were brought back to school   
 and the children looked at them       </content>
