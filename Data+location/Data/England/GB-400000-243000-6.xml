		<content>    I belong to quite a lot of{clubs.}I
 go to{Brownies, choir}and after school
 on Wednesday I do{Gym Club at School.}
 At Brownies it's good, we work for    
 badges I have got eight of them. The  
 favourite things at Brownies I like   
 are swimming and playing the games. At
 choir there is a Monday practice for  
 all of us. I like going to the junior 
 practice the best. We have wages twice
 a year; we have 1.5O the first time  
 and the same money the second time. If
 we go to a wedding to sing we get 5Op;
 that's why I like going to them.{
