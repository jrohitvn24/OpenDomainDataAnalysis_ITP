		<title>18Traffic counts in Stoke</title>
		<content>On 24th. May 1985 we went to make      
traffic counts on 5 roads in our area. 
We chose a dual carriageway and 4 main 
roads.We counted for 15 minutes.       
  The A500 was very busy.In 15 minutes 
540 cars,179 lorries and vans,5 buses  
and coaches and 16 bikes passed by.The 
road was so busy it was hard to keep   
the count!                             
  Of the other 4 roads London Road was 
the busiest with 130 cars,22 lorries   
and vans,2 buses and coaches and 12    
bikes.London Road is so busy because it
links Stoke with Trent Vale and        
Hanford.It is also a main bus route.   
There are a number of danger spots     
along the road,so there are 2 sets of  
pelican crossings and a zebra crossing.
  The quietest road was Trent Valley   
Road.Only 36 vehicles passed during the
15 minutes.                            
                                       </content>
