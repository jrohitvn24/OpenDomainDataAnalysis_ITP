		<title>08ARGUMENTS FOR THE COALMINE</title>
		<content>In 11 years there will be a coalmine in
Kenilworth.It will be the largest in   
Britain. People say it will produce    
more jobs for teenagers and people     
living near by. The new mine will      
probably mean a great growth in        
industry so both industrial estates    
will prosper. Hopefully with the sudden
growth in population there will be     
better facilites for the public.A new  
sports centre is being built which     
might be expanded in the future. The   
old railway in Crackley Woods which    
will be near the mine will probably be 
opened to ship coal to nearby power    
stations. If the railway were to be    
opened it would mean an easier link to 
larger cities. New roads would have to 
be built as well, which will be slip   
roads around Kenilworth.Over all we    
think that the mine will be a good     
thing for Kenilworth.                  </content>
