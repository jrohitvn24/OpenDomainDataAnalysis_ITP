		<content> There are three main denominations:   
{Church of England: }St John the       
 Evangelist is the CE church and is    
 situated next to the school at the top
 of Church Wood. Built of stone in the 
 l860's it is small but well cared for 
 by the worshippers.  The churchyard is
 used by people of other denominations 
 and is entered by a lych gate.  There 
 are at least two services each Sunday 
 as well as other regular functions    
 during the week such as the           
 Mothers'Union.  On the first Sunday   
 each month there is a family communion
 service and this is usually followed  
 by refreshments in the school.        
 The Vicar no longer lives at the      
 nearby vicarage but about 7 miles away
 at the village of Scorton where he has
 another church.
