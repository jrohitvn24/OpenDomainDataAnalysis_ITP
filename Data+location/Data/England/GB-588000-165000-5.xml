		<content> Iwade and Kemsley have most of the    
 clubs and activities - people from    
 Milton and Bobbing seem to use        
 Sittingbourne amenities. Iwade is     
 fortunate in having two halls. Scouts 
 Cubs, Brownies and a church based     
 Lamplighters groups meet in the school
 hall. While a Youth club (which       
 disbands and reforms as leaders appear
 or have had enough), Womens institute,
 Evergreen club, Keep Fit, Playgroup   
 and Toddlers clubs meet in the village
 hall. Kemsley have a Youth club, a    
 Majorettes Troop, Playgroup and Cubs  
 which meet in their hall. While a Keep
 Fit group meet at Bobbing village hall
 Clubs connected with Milton church    
 meet at a hall in the centre of Milton
 clearly the existance of clubs depend 
 on suitable meeting places being      
 available and dedicated people to     
 organise and run them.                </content>
