		<title>06A NOTTINGHAM PRISON OFFICER</title>
		<content> We went to Nottingham Prison to talk  
 to Mr Martingell,a Prison Officer,who 
 has been in the service for 30yrs.He  
 likes working in Nottingham because it
 is a nice,comfortable and quiet prison
 He gets up at 5.00am.and comes off    
 duty at 8.30pm.He tries to train the  
 prisoners to behave themselves.The    
 Officers try to work on a personality 
 basis rather than a show of force.He  
 has occasionally been assaulted and   
 has felt angry at the time,but only   
 later has he worried and realised what
 might have happened.In his 11yrs at   
 Nottingham he has noticed that the    
 degree of crime,especially violent,   
 among the prisoners,has become        
 steadily worse.He thought this trend  
 would continue unless something could 
 be done to make people see the need to
 respect each other and each other's   
 views.                                </content>
