{       }At Ulley there was a school   
 for all the local children.The school 
 closed when the numbers of children   
 attending grew smaller and smaller.The
 school bell still hangs from the      
 roof.The bell was used to call the    
 children to school.The playground is  
 gradually being overgrown by weeds and
 grass.                                
      The building is now used as a    
 community centre for the              
 villagers.Ulley Youth Club meet in the
 hall regularly. Old-time dances are   
 held for the old folk each week.      
      Sunday School meets in the       
 building every week and after services
 in the church the congregation meet   
 for coffee.
