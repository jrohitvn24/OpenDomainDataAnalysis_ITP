		<title>04Housing in Bridport</title>
		<content>      In the centre of Bridport there  
 are many old houses dating from the   
 eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  
 On the main roads most of these houses
 have brick fronts while the back walls
 are stone. Behind the main streets are
 a number of narrow alleyways leading  
 to small terraced houses. This old    
 part of the town is sited on the      
 raised area between the rivers Brit   
 and Asker.                            
      To the South-East and South-West 
 of the old centre are areas of newer  
 housing.To the South-West Skilling    
 consists mainly of council houses and 
 flats.To the South-East the new       
 private housing developments of       
 Bothenhampton and Wanderwell have     
 virtually surrounded the old village  
 of Bothenhampton.
