<title>23Coton Manor</title>
<content>

Coton Manor is surrounded by a charming old English garden, beautifully laid out and enhanced by a collection of waterfowl. The house is of 17th century stone dating back to 1662. It was built on the site of a previous manor house mentioned in the Domesday Book which was razed to the ground after the Battle of Naseby by Cromwell supporters.&lt;br />&lt;br />The ten acres of garden originally laid out in 1925 by the grandparents of the present owner, encloses a series of smaller gardens providing interest and variety throughout. &lt;br />&lt;br />The gardens have been renovated and replanted in recent years and are now maintained to the highest standard. Luxuriant borders of delight the plant enthusiast while everyone enjoys the charm and special atmosphere of the garden, with colour and interest maintained throughout the season. Other aspects to enjoy at Coton are the extensive nursery, a cafe serving homemade lunches and teas and a Garden School which covers a variety of horticultural topics presented by well known lecturers. &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
