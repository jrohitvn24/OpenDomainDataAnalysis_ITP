		<title>06TREDINGTON CHURCH</title>
		<content> It is often said that there is a      
 tombstone in{Tredington Churchyard    
 with the words below.  There might    
 have been in the past, for a good many
 of the old stones were removed many   
 years ago.                            
 "Dirty Tredington, wooden steeple     
  Funny parson, wicked people"         
 Another version has as the second line
 ..."wicked parson, funny people"      
                                       
 The present{wooden tower at Tredington
 (which looks as though it belongs to  
 the Tudor era) was built in 1936.     
 This replaced one, built in 1902 in   
 the same style, which had collapsed.  
 Before that time the wooden tower     
 (hardly deserves the word steeple,    
 though it has a weathercock on it)    
 was an ordinary square affair as seen 
 on paintings in the church.
