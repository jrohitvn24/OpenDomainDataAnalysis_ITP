		<content>In Northampton we have several         
hospitals and an excellent system of   
health care. The new General Hospital  
ha only recently been opened and is an 
extension of the old General Hospital  
situated near Becket's Park not far    
from the town centre. The Manfield     
Hospital is an orthopaedic hospital.   
St.Edmunds Hospital on the             
Wellingborough Road was once the old   
Northampton Workhouse. It also served  
as a maternity unit but is now mainly  
for old people. There are also several 
private hospitals including St. Andrews
St. Matthews and the new Three Shires  
Hospital built in the grounds of St.   
Andrews' Hospital. As Northampton is   
close to the M1 motorway the main      
General Hospital has become an         
important centre for accident and      
emergency treatment.
