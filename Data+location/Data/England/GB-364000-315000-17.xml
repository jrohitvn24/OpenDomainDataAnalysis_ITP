		<content> Kynnersley Manor House,which was      
 largely rebuilt in the Duke of        
 Sutherland style in 1860 has a        
 panneled room that used to be the     
 local court room.Until 1840 villagers 
 were tried in this room and if        
 convicted of such crimes as sheep     
 stealing were hanged from the Oak tree
 on the Whym,which is a triangular     
 piece of raised ground just outside   
 the Manor House.It is thought that the
 bodies were then buried in a piece of 
 ground at the side of Whym cottage,the
 ground is now incorporated into Whym  
 cottages garden.A most interesting    
 ancient site is the remains of        
 extensive earthworks enclosing over 20
 acres and surrounding the buildings of
 Wall Farm.The embankment is of stones 
 and earth and about 20 feet           
 wide.
