		<title>02MY VILLAGE    by Tom Clegg</title>
		<content> Crawshawbooth is a good place to walk 
 in the countryside.Once ortwice a week
 I go on a walk with my dog.I live on  
 Goodshaw Lane opposite a church,      
 called St.Mary's and All Saints.      
 My house used to be a pub called the  
 White Horse.Near my house is a stream 
 and when I go for walks I normally    
 walk down by the stream.              
 In the village thers is a post office 
 a fish and chip shop,a newsagents,a   
 doctors,and a chemists.               
 I go to Crawshawbooth C.P.School which
 is on Burnley Road.                   
 From my bedroom window I can see some 
 of the houses on the next estate up at
 Loveclough.Next to me there is a farm.
 The farmer keeps hens,cows,some sheep 
 and a goat.                           
 There are some flats quite near to the
 church,which are mainly occupied by   
 old aged pensioners.                  </content>
