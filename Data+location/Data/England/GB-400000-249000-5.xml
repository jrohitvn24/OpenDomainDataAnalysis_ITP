   There are few hedges particularly in
 the East and often of poor quality    
 with few hedgerow trees.The loss of   
 the elms through Dutch Elm disease has
 left a serious gap but there is       
 evidence of replanting of other       
 deciduous trees in isolated spots.    
 There is a deeply tree-lined approach 
 to Sherriffs Lench and some tree      
 clumps in the other villages. The     
 only exotic trees are in Sheriffs     
 Lench and Church Lench .              
    The dominant topographical feature 
 is the S-shaped tree covered ridge    
 known as Bishampton Bank. There are   
 deciduous trees at the top and a      
 cultivated escarpment facing West.
