		<content> This trout stream flows into the River
 Tyne.It is in a fine valley which     
 gives shelter to badgers, foxes,      
 squirrels, owls, kingfishers, stoats, 
 weasels and many rabbits.There is a   
 pheasant farm on its banks at         
 Standalone.In the{Nineteenth Century} 
 it was an important{industrial}valley.
{Lead ore &amp; Iron ore}were worked, and  
{stone}was{quarried.}The burn still    
 feeds a reservoir which once supplied 
 water to the{Langley Barony lead mines
 Near Woodbine Cottage a weir was built
 and a{water-wheel}installed so that   
 water could be pumped to five farm -  
 houses. The remains of all these      
 workings can still be seen. We have   
 found that many nearby houses were    
 inhabited by miners &amp; masons in the   
 1851 Census. They now house farmers,  
 a teacher, an Estate agent, a         
 barrister and a gamekeeper.           </content>
