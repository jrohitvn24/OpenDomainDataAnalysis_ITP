 factory were given a{house}by Levers. 
 These houses were mostly in Tudor     
 design, there are a number of         
 continental designs too.  The         
 building's were built between 1888 and
 1930.  There were seven houses to an  
 acre which  cost Â£200 each.{ Church

 parents did not work for Levers were  
 refused entry to the school. {The Lady
