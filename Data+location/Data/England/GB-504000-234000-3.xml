 "The vital function of Parish Councils
 is to voice "grass-roots" opinion     
 within local government"              
 Pulloxhill Parish Council comprises 7 
 members, elected by popular ballot    
 every 4 years. It elects a Chairman   
 and Vice Chairman internally. It      
 employs a part-time Clerk for routine 
 administration. The Council's function
 is mainly advisory, with very little  
 executive power. The County and       
 District Councils consult its opinion 
 on many matters, the commonest being  
 planning. The Council's direct        
 responsibilities are streetlighting   
 and grasscutting; it maintains The    
 Shelter,a small building owned by the 
 Parish; provides a Recreation Ground  
 and elects one school governor. Expend
 iture is approx. Â£2000 p.a.obtained   
 through the Rates by Parish Precept.  </content>
