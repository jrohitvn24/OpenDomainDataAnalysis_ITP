		<title>17Interview with the Rector</title>
		<content> The rector of St.Nicholas' Church,    
 Ashchurch, is Rev.K.Corless. His job  
 is to look after the church and visit 
 people who need help.He also visits   
 schools to talk about Jesus and God.  
 These are a few of his answers to     
 some of our questions.We asked him how
 long he had been working in the church
 and he answered 24 years but only 16  
 years at Ashchurch.Another question   
 was do you have any spare time? He    
 said very little but when I have I do 
 model engineering,art and collecting  
 match boxes.We also asked him have you
 ever seen a ghost? The reply was:'No  
 I haven't'.(The rector keeps an open  
 mind about ghosts and he feels if     
 ghosts exist, they are probably nice).
 The church costs Â£1200 to run a year. 
 The rector said his favourite story   
 out of the bible is Joshua and the    
 walls of Jericho.                     </content>
