		<title>04THE GOATSHEAD INN</title>
		<content> The Goatshead was built in 1573.It    
 used to be the village's Town Hall. It
 has a stable at the back and is now   
 used as a public house.There is a     
 legend that Dick Turpin once stayed   
 there for a night and in the morning  
 he went to Rugeley to steal "Black    
 Bess".                                
 The Goatshead has a secret passage    
 under it, which leads to the church   
 and Manor Farm.The passage is now     
 blocked off, but part of it is used as
 the cellars where the beer is kept.   
 The building is made of a timber frame
 with wattle and daub infill. The      
 present landlord keeps an aviary      
 and a hen run in the back garden.They 
 have 9 hens,3 pheasants and 4 quails.
