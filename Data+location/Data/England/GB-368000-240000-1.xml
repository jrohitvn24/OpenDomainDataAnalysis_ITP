		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW.</title>
		<content> This area consists mainly of highly   
 mechanised{arable farmland}with some  
 cattle grazing and two small, mainly  
 coniferous plantations. Most of the   
 farms were run by managers who were,  
 as a rule, rather reticent.           
 There is one village with extensive   
{new housing}and two small hamlets -   
 one with a{Saxon Church}- little      
 changed over the centuries. Otherwise 
 housing, apart from a block of 4      
 council houses, consists of scattered 
 old cottages and several{listed       
{farmhouses.                           
 There is a thriving{PYO fruit farm,}a 
 growing{leisure fishing}enterprise,   
 and there are many{social activities  
 in the village hall and the Pub.The   
 facilities are negligible and the     
 resididents mostly{commute to work.   
{Ecology and Conservation}are important
 considerations.                       </content>
