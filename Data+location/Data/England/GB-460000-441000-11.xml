		<title>11Education in Escrick.</title>
		<content> We have two schools in our area.One,  
 Queen Margaret's School is an         
 independent girls'school,the other,a  
 Church of England primary school is   
 run by the local education authority. 
 Escrick Primary School has about 80   
 pupils,but numbers are decreasing     
 annually as the birth_rate declines.  
 The school is in 2 parts,separated by 
 a playing field.The infants,aged 4-7  
 years are in a modern block which has 
 29 children in 2 classes.The 2 junior 
 classes with pupils aged 7-11 years   
 are housed in the old building which  
 used to be a barn for Escrick Estate, 
 but which has been used as a school   
 for over 100 years.The infants'       
 building was to be extended to        
 incorporate the juniors but financial 
 cutbacks and falling roles stopped    
 further building.Pupils aged 11+      
 travel daily to Fulford Comprehensive.</content>
