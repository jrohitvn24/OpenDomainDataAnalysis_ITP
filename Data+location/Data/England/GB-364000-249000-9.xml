		<title>09Local Entertainment</title>
		<content> For most part of their entertainment  
 people have to travel to the          
 surrounding areas: many patronise the 
 theatre in Bromyard where the local   
 amateur group produce two or three    
 plays a year.  Also at the Bromyard   
 theatre it is possible to see films   
 shown on behalf of organisations such 
 as the Nature Trust and film society. 
 Local entertainment consists of       
 membership of the Young Farmers Club, 
 floral clubs. and others. Three people
 listed their chief entertainment as   
 visiting the public house.  The Holly 
 Bush in Munderfield has musical       
 evenings which are very popular.      
 Bromyard Gala is held each year in the
 last week in June in the neighbouring 
 parish of Stoke Lacy, and a very      
 successful folk festival is held in   
 Bromyard every autumn.
