		<content>{A Day in the Life of Mrs Hennah}      
                                       
 Mrs Hennah is one of our teachers. She
 went to school in Stanwell but lives  
 in Ashford now. She went to the Girls 
 School but that is flats now.         
                                       
 She gets up at 7 o'clock and gets     
 breakfast for her three sons and her  
 husband. Then she makes the sandwiches
 for her husband to take to work. Then 
 she goes to work herself. She teaches 
 in our nursery class. She tells       
 stories and plays the piano for       
 singing.                              
                                       
 When she gets home, sometimes one of  
 her sons make a cup of tea for her    
 before she cooks the dinner.          
 When her sons are asleep she likes to 
 read.
