		<content>   The presence of a number of wealthy 
 country houses in the village is      
 probably explained by the fact that   
 the principal Manor in Much Hadham    
 belonged to the Bishops of London from
 before the Norman Conquest until 1888,
 when it was sold by the Ecclesiastical
 Commissioners.                        
   Just where the River Ash bends round
 Bush Hill is The Palace.Here began    
 the Tudor Dynasty,for Henry V's widow 
 gave birth in this place to Edmund    
 Tudor,whose son Harry won the throne  
 on Bosworth Field.The building has    
 changed since then and today it is    
 mainly 16th century,with an outer     
 casing of 17th century brick. A floor 
 cuts in half the fine old hall with   
 its gabled windows and mighty oak     
 girders but there is an elegant       
 staircase and 17th century panelling.
