		<title>09The Talbot Hotel</title>
		<content>There are 39 bedrooms and 38 people who
work in the hotel.   The front of the  
hotel is very old.   On the stairs is  
the mark of the ring of Mary Queen of  
Scots.  It is thought that the         
staircase came from Fotheringhay Castle
when it was knocked down.  There is a  
picture of Mary Queen of the Scots on  
the wall. She had a black dress with   
eyes on it when she was executed.      
There are five conference rooms.  The  
bedrooms are very nice and they have a 
radio and T.V. and private bathroom    
and there are notices that you can put 
on your bedroom door saying what time  
you want your breakfast.
