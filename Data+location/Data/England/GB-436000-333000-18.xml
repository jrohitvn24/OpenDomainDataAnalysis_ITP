		<title>18BOULTON INFANT SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The name of our school is Boulton   
 Infant School.It is on Wyndham Street 
 Alvaston, Derby,and is 53 years old.  
                                       
   The school was built with brown     
 bricks and has white wooden window    
 frames.The canteen where we have our  
 dinner is separate, and was built from
 brown bricks too,but has metal window 
 frames.                               
                                       
   At the front of our school is a     
 small wall,with iron railings and iron
 gates.                                
   We have two playgrounds and two     
 gardens.In the gardens are trees,     
 flowers, and bushes.There is a playing
 field at the back of the building.    
                                       
   The Junior school is joined to the  
 Infant building,which makes it one    
 building,but we are separate schools. </content>
