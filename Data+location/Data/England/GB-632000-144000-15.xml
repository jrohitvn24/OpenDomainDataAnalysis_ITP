		<title>15RAILWAY TRAFFIC</title>
		<content> In common with most other routes in   
 South-East England,traffic has been   
 mainly passenger. There has always    
 been a through service to London      
 (Charing Cross) which was not very    
 frequent in the days of steam,but     
 which became 2 trains per hour when   
 electrified in 1961. Today there are  
 24 services a day in each direction   
 between London and Sandwich. All these
 stop at Martin Mill. There has been   
 some general goods traffic and the    
 development of the Kent coalfield led 
 to some of the coal from Betteshanger 
 colliery using the line to Dover docks
 and London. With the recent decline   
 of coal less freight is carried.      
 During the Second World War a 13.5    
 inch railway gun ,named Gladiator,and 
 one of three in the area was stationed
 at Martin Mill. It hid from enemy fire
 in Guston Tunnel.                     </content>
