		<content>{Yeoford Trinity Church}is just across 
 the road from{Yeoford School. Yeoford 
{Church}is called{Holy Trinity,}which  
 means that it is dedicated to the     
 Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. It   
 was built in 1891, and the site was   
 given by Sir John Shelley of Shobrooke
 park. The foundation stone was laid on
 November 26th 1891 by Lady Audrey     
 Buller of Downs House Crediton. It was
 closed down in about 1971, because of 
 the lack of attendance. It was        
 reopened in 1984 because someone      
 thought it would be nice to have      
 church services again. The first      
 service after the Church was reopened 
 was a Christmas Service, and as there 
 was no electricity, they had a        
 candlelight service. The service was  
 held on 16th December 1984. They have 
 one service a month, and hope to      
 increase it by the Autumn.            </content>
