		<title>07Children's names</title>
		<content> We did a study on the boys and girls  
 names in our school.We asked some     
 children what their mums and grandmas'
 names are.The most unusual grandmas'  
 names are Gwendoline, Muriel and      
 Irene.The most unusual mums' names are
 Vivienne,Rita and Brenda.The mums' and
 grandmas' names are different from the
 childrens' names in our school today. 
 The most unusual girls' names in our  
 school are Thomasina,Jacqueline,Nina  
 and Mellisa.The most popular girls'   
 names in our school are Claire,Lisa,  
 Rachel,Nicola and Tracy.We found that 
 the most popular boys' names were     
 Paul,David,Mark and Wayne.In our      
 school there are eight Marks,eleven   
 Pauls,nine Davids,and five Waynes.We  
 have three sets of identical twins in 
 one school.Children are often named   
 after famous people,such as           
 footballers,or television  stars.     </content>
