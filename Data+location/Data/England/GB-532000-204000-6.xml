		<content>   As part of the survey into the areas
 of Brookmans Park and Welham wenoted  
 houses which particularily caught our 
 attention. One such house was in      
 Brookmans Avenue. The house was 50    
 years old and made of ship's timbers  
 In the front garden was an ornamental 
 well and parked on the drive was a    
 Triumph Stag and aTriumph Accord. The 
 back garden is very lovely and leads  
 on to the golf course. Inside the     
 house there were exposed beams of oak 
 which measured 10 inches thick.The    
 fire was in a small inglenook which   
 had been reduced from its original    
 size.The stairs were also made of oak.
 Each of the windows had jewelled      
 handles and the doors were covered    
 with leather guards.In each room was a
 bell for servants although there were 
 no longer any servants.They used to   
 listen to the main kitchen signal box.</content>
