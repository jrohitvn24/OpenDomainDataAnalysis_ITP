		<title>05The Parish Church Choir.</title>
		<content>   In the church choir there are twelve
 children and sixteen adults.The age   
 range is from seven to over eighty.We 
 have to wear a blue or black cassock  
 and white surplice and ruff.These are 
 put on in the vestry. We have two     
 organs,a small one in the vestry and  
 the main organ next to the choir      
 stalls.Miss Smith plays the organ.The 
 main services which are the ones that 
 the choir sing,are on Sunday mornings.
 At the family service the junior choir
 sit in the front pews and at Eucharist
 they go up to receive communion.Some  
 sundays we have Mattins which involves
 singing a lot of psalms.On Friday at  
 seven o'clock the children have their 
 choir practice taken by Mr.Smith.We   
 have about fifty weddings a year for  
 which we are paid 50p. On special     
 occasions we sing an anthem and at    
 weddings we often sing Crimmond.      </content>
