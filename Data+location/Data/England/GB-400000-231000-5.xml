		<content>   Our square contains the older part  
 of the village of Toddington centred  
 around the church and Toddington      
 Manor.                                
   The church of St. Andrew is the     
 third on the site, the earliest dating
 from the Middle Ages. The present     
 church was built in 1723.             
   The church, Manor and village are   
 connected with the Tracy family,      
 descendants of Edward 11. The Manor is
 now closed having been used most      
 recently as a school for foreign      
 students. The present Manor is        
 Victorian and is typically ornate. The
 remains of the original Manor can be  
 seen by the church.                   
   Toddington, like most villages in   
 the area, has changed from a farming  
 community to a dormitory village with 
 residents working in nearby towns,    
 notably Cheltenham.                   </content>
