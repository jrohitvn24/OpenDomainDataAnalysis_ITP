   Our area includes the villages of   
 Jump, and part of Hemingfield and the 
 town of Hoyland. Hoyland itself is    
 made up of Elsecar, Hoyland Common,   
 Platts Common. It is part of the      
 Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley      
 being in the County of South          
 Yorkshire. Jump and Hemingfield being 
 small villages orientate themselves   
 towards the town of Wombwell. Hoyland 
 today is a busy small town with a {   
{population}of approximately 16,000    
 people and covering 1,999 acres.  The 
 name Hoyland means highland because   
 the town is built on top of a hill.   
 It appears in the{Domesday Book}as    
 Hoiland and the land was once owned by
 King Harold.  The town grew up around 
 iron works and coalmines but the      
 ironworks died out in 1880 and the    
 coalmine at Elsecar closed in 1982.   </content>
