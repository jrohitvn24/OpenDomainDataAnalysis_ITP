		<title>19  Changes in Monks Kirby.</title>
		<content>  Mrs.Hopkins,who runs the Post Office 
 has seen changes she has liked and    
 some she has not.In the 49 years she  
 has lived in Monks Kirby she has      
 witnessed the building of many new    
 houses which in turn have brought new 
 faces into the village.The increase in
 traffic to and from the school has    
 made life quite difficult along the   
 narrow lanes of the village at times. 
  Mrs.Tennant and Mrs.Leech recent     
 occupants of some of the new houses   
 think the village is very nice as it  
 is because it is small enough to know 
 every one and although they miss the  
 closeness of amenities such as        
 theatres and libraries they consider  
 that,for the children,the privilage of
 living and growing up in the          
 country side is more than adequate    
 compensation.
