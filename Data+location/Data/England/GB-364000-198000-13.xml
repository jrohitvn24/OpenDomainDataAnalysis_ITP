		<title>13THE MILL, BERKELEY VALE (2)</title>
		<content> The mill, known as Englands Mills,    
 uses{wheat}grown in the surrounding   
 counties, such as Gloucestershire and 
 Herefordshire, and Canadian wheat. The
 two are{mixed}to give a{good quality  
{flour.}This summer though, was a bad  
 one for wheat harvests so supplies    
 were obtained from France and Germany 
 (poorer quality wheat), Australia (an 
 expensive source) and America (also   
 costly). The demand for{stoneground   
{flour}is actually{increasing,}so these
 supply difficulties will mean higher  
 flour prices.                         
 Due to{EEC prices,}bread and flour are
 to get a price increase anyway, so all
 looks gloomy for the consumer.        
 As the market for the mill's products 
 does look good, the future of the mill
 seems fairly secure. Success has only 
 come for the mill by its own efforts; 
 the Government has given no cash help.</content>
