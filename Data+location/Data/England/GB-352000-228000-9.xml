		<content> Mr.and Mrs. Hurley own a bed and      
 breakfast guesthouse in Hoarwithy.    
 About 100 people stay there in one    
 year excluding Christmas. Apart from  
 owning a guesthouse Mr.and Mrs. Hurley
 hold wine tasting weekends when people
 come and taste wines from all over the
 world.The wines are not blended wines.
 They are each made from one particular
 grape vine. The largest number of     
 people that have stayed at Upper      
 Orchard is 25 (including campers in   
 the garden). Mrs. Hurley says that the
 most they can have staying in the     
 house, including young children and   
 babies, is 15. Mrs. Hurley likes      
 walking and says that there are 14    
 footpaths in Hoarwithy. Some are      
 obstructed by wire including Mrs.     
 Hurley's favourite walk. The longest  
 footpath starts in the village of     
 Hoarwithy and goes to Harewood End.   </content>
