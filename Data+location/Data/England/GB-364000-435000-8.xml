		<title>08Old Buildings in Ribchester</title>
		<content>Much of the present parish church was  
built in the Thirteenth century and    
later. It has been altered a great     
deal since then. The nave and chancel  
are Early English. There are  lancet   
Windows in the east gable of the       
chancel &amp; the severel smaller ones in  
other parts of the church especially in
the South wall of the chancel.The old  
carved doorway has a later porch built 
on to it . The porch used to be two    
storys high, the upper floor           
containing a library. The pillars      
supporting the White Bull came from a  
Roman Temple and were found in the     
River Ribble . There is a mounting     
block outside the front door.And an old
stable at the side. Dutton Hall, built 
in the reign of Charles II by the      
Townley family contains a judges box   
and court room. Near by is a barn with 
an unusual dove-cote.                  </content>
