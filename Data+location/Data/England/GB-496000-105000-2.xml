		<content> In the block are two state village    
 schools _ Walberton and Binsted C.of  
 E. Primary School and Slindon Primary 
 School.  There is also a Nursery      
 School on the Walberton site which    
 takes 24 pre_school children four     
 mornings a week.  This school has a   
 waiting list.                         
 The Walberton school in the last eight
 years has seen its numbers vary from  
 160+ to less than 120, due to a       
 national fall in birthrate, then back 
 to 170+ by 1986.  The recovery is not 
 due to a sudden fertility rise in the 
 village but because of a recent influx
 of children from outside the village  
 as the school is enjoying a good      
 reputation locally.  Its strengths are
 its academic standards, music         
 teaching, drama performances, computer
 use and particularly involvement of   
 parents.                              </content>
