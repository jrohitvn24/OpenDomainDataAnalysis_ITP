		<title>13Sparham Industry (1)</title>
		<content> Although a small village, there is no 
 lack of private enterprise in Sparham.
 There are two coalyards, one owned by 
 Mr G.A. Egmore, who buys coal from the
 E. Midlands and Wales and delivers in 
 a 10 mile radius round Sparham. The   
 second coal- and wood-yard deals in   
 wood collected from Norfolk and       
 Lincolnshire, this is cut into pit    
 props for coal mines in Mansfield,    
 Leicestershire and Yorkshire.         
 "Travelwide" coaches operate 1 minibus
 and 6 coaches for private hire; routes
 range from transporting children in   
 the district to schools in Lyng and   
 Reepham, workers to Matthews turkey   
 factory and trips to the continent.   
 "One-man" industries include a painter
 and decorator, and the owner of a JCB 
 digger whose work includes drainage   
 digging and excavating the footings   
 for houses.                           </content>
