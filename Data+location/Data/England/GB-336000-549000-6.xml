		<title>06The Dalston Gala</title>
		<content> Every year in Dalston we have a  gala 
 day. It is normally in June.It lasts  
 for one day. The people that go can   
 enter races, some people enter little 
 things like the treasure hunt. In the 
 treasure hunt little sticks are put   
 into the ground to tell you where     
 the treasure is. If you won any of the
 races or the fancy dress for yourself 
 or your bike then you got a load of   
 sweets and money. It is free to get in
 and the children get afree tea. It is 
 organised by Dalston Parish Council.  
 There are shows like the magician and 
 the puppets. There was a fire engine  
 display and a B.M.X track. There was  
 also a 'bat the mouse', roll the ball 
 on the pound, a golf competition and a
 kick the ball through the frame       
 competition. I think it was very      
 enjoyable. May be you'll come one day.
