		<title>13Grandad: Durham Councillor</title>
		<content>       In 1975 my grandad,{Councillor  
{Joe Paterson,}was elected{Mayor of    
{Darlington. }He has been elected many 
 times by the voters of Eastbourne     
 Ward, Darlington.  During elections I 
 help to collect numbers, mark a       
 register and give out leaflets.       
       In 1983 my grandad was elected  
 Vice-chairman of the{Durham County    
{Council}and this year, following the  
 elections he was made Chairman.       
       At important meetings my family 
 and I sit in the public gallery of the
 council chamber.  There we see many of
 the chief officials.  Near the Vice-  
 Chairman are three lights.  When the  
 white one shines the speaker may      
 continue; orange shows half his time  
 has gone, but when the red one shines 
 he must stop.
