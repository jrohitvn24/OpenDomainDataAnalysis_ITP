		<content> To some the hub of village life is the
 shop, to others it is the school, but 
 to many others it is the 2 pubs. The  
{Swan Inn}has had the same landlady for
 many years, it is very popular because
 of its homely atmosphere. It was      
 originally the smithy.                
 The{Roebuck Inn}was once a coaching   
 house between Lichfield and Ashbourne,
 it is one of our oldest buildings and 
 was once in the village centre.       
                                       
 When the Victorians built new houses  
 and a school, for the Gypsum mine     
 workers, the village centre migrated  
 to its present position. Draycott's   
 Post Office/shop was recently awarded 
 second place for best village shop in 
 Staffordshire. The village also has a 
 garage which is a landmark for many   
 motorists as they travel along the    
 "main" road.                          </content>
