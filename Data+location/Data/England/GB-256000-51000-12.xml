		<title>12Yealmpton Cider Press</title>
		<content> In recent years{the old cider press}at
 Bowden Farm was restored by the       
 Amenity Society and cider was once    
 more produced. Bowden Farm is now     
 being redeveloped to provide housing ,
 using as much as possible of the old  
 farm buildings. The developer has     
 offered the cider press to the village
 with the proviso that a permenant home
 will be found for it in the village.  
 It is hoped that it will eventually be
 placed at the new community centre.   
 On a Monday in June the press was     
 detatched from it's base and lifted on
 to a transporter and removed to       
 temporary accomodation at the farm of 
 Mr.Cross.                             
{New England Quarry.}Quarry extracts a 
 volcanic rock called dolerite.This    
 quarry was started in 1930 and at     
 present employs 15 men and processes  
 approx 150,000 tonnes per year.       </content>
