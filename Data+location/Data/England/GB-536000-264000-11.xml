		<content> My day starts by getting ready for    
 school. I have a small breakfast of   
 cereal, and then leave for school.    
   School begins with a short service  
 in the Hall for the older children.   
 We meet for a hymn and a short prayer.
 Then we do some work in our classroom 
 with our own teacher, in the mornings 
 usually maths and language work.      
   At noon we have a long break, and I 
 have a school dinner. The afternoon   
 begins with some music to listen to,  
 and a poem, and then we do some       
 Project or general interest work.     
 Often we finish with our class story  
 or with a time when we can read to    
 ourselves.At 3.30 we all go home. I   
 then get changed and play with my     
 friends. After tea I play out again,  
 or perhaps watch television.I go to   
 bed at about eight o'clock.
