    Generally, the area suffers        
 very little from pollution.  There    
 are, however, potential sources of    
 river pollution.  The main one is     
 silage effluent.  This is controlled  
 fairly well; although the river here  
 is not entirely free from it, little, 
 if any, enters the river in the area  
 itself.  A smaller source of          
 agricultural pollution are nitrates,  
 used on a small scale on the valley   
 floor, where a little barley is grown.
   There is no problem caused by sewage
 effluent as this goes to a sewage     
 treatment works, which returns pure   
 water to the River Esk.  The main     
 tributary in the area is Iburndale    
 Beck, which contains good quality     
 water, flowing from pastoral fields   
 and woodland.                         </content>
