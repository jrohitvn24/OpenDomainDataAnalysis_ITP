		<content>  Knights Hospitallers                 
 The Knights Hospitallers wore black   
 cloaks with a white cross on the left 
 breast and were also known as the     
 order of St John of Jerusalem.  They  
 probably abandoned Godsfield  at the  
 time of the Black Death for their     
 other Hampshire chapel at North       
 Baddesley.                            
 In Early Mediaeval England pilgrims   
 would be flocking to the shrine of St 
 Swithun in Winchester.  It was the    
 custome and fashion to visite  such   
 shrines and pilgrims would boast of   
 their pilgrimages by wearing little   
 lead badges.
