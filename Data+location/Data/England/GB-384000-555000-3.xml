		<title>03A NEW HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content> We did a survey about the new housing 
 estate at{Forstersteads}in Allendale. 
 The firm building this estate was   { 
 Newmans.We interviewed six people     
 altogether, the first person was the  
 foreman on the site. These are our    
 results. The wood that was used to    
 build the houses was{spruce,}they used
{tiles}on the roof. They have steetly  
 bricks which they get from{Throckley} 
{Brickworks.}They use half a tonne of  
 cement in one day, they use sand which
 they get from{Corbridge.}About one    
 thousand gallons of water is used in  
 the building of one house.            
 The houses cost around forty thousand 
 pounds. But of course it depends on   
 the size. There will only be twenty   
 builders on the site at any one time, 
 they work nine hours a day. It takes  
 about ten weeks to build one house,   
 there will be{thirty-two}houses       </content>
