		<content> At the{CLEANAWAY SITE}there is lots of
 wildlife. They have SEAGULLS,BADGERS, 
 MOLES,FOXES,HARES,RABBITS and lots    
 more.To catch seagulls they have 4    
 canons attached to a net.They have{25 
 grams of gunpowder in it.When the     
 seagulls are settled on the rubbish   
 men fire the canon and the net goes up
 in the air and then  falls down on the
 seagulls.They take the net off and put
 them in a sack.None of them are       
 harmed or killed.They put rings on    
 them and let them go.If they come back
 they look up the number and see if it 
 has been before. Five nesting boxes   
 for kestrels are also on the site.    
 Seagulls have been found from the site
 in{RUSSIA}and other countries. Injured
 seagulls and animals are looked after 
 at the site.
