		<title>11LEISURE IN RODNEY STOKE</title>
		<content> Rodney Stoke is a small, quiet village
 and most people are satisfied with the
 evenings entertainment on television. 
 Day trips to Wells or Weston, usually 
 combined with a visit for shopping in 
 the car, are also common. Individual  
 hobbies abound and gardening is       
 popular amongst older people. The     
 younger generation are keener to      
 travel to places with more evening    
 activity, such as 'disco dances' or   
 pubs outside the village. Nevertheless
 home computers can make a teenager    
 hide away happily in a quiet village  
 and one young man was found to be     
 repairing his motor bike in his       
 bedroom!. The June 'Strawberry Fayre' 
 at Draycott and local Gymkhanas are   
 other attractions for the whole       
 community whilst the Rodney Stoke Inn 
 is popular as the local hostelry with 
 its skittle alley in regular use.     </content>
