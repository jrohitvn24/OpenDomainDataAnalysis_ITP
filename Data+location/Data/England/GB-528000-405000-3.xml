		<content>   There is a recently built Roman     
 Catholic First and Middle School in   
 the north of the block (St.Joseph's). 
 The school draws children from all    
 parts of Grimsby and Cleethorpes.     
   One of the main problems for the    
 people in the north-eastern area of   
 the block is the proposed development 
 of a 'fun park' around the boating    
 lake. The residents object to the     
 development because of the increased  
 noise it will generate.               
   Problems have already been          
 experienced by residents of the south 
 of the resort due to the noise from a 
 stockcar stadium and car-parking      
 problems generated by a Sunday market.
   After severe high tides and flooding
 demolished the old bathing pool a new 
 leisure centre was opened on the same 
 site.This development offers many new 
 facilities for locals and tourists.   </content>
