		<title>04FARMING IN THE LEWES AREA</title>
		<content>      Mr.Robinson's Rise Farm, south of
 Lewes, is the only working farm left  
 in our block. It is typical of the    
 area. Stephen, Jamie, Martin and Lee  
 went to visit the farm. {"We found out
{that the farm is a mixed farm. It     
{produces 2000 litres of milk a day.   
{The farm had 60 cows but it doubled   
{its stock to l20. They own 487 acres  
{of land. Mr.Robinson bought the farm  
{in l929 for 2/6d per acre, and today  
{he would pay Â£2000 per acre.          
{                                      
{    The river used to overflow and lap
{against the cottage doors. To solve   
{this problem, he dug a ditch in every 
{field. It has worked ever since. His  
{products go as far afield as France,  
{and he buys his equipment from        
{Culverwells in Lewes."
