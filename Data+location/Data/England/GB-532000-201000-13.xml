		<content>     Most of the farms in this area are
 small dairy farms.They vary in size,  
 one of the larger being Burnt Farm    
 which is 300 acres.It has a barn      
 which is over 300 years old and is    
 also a listed building.Because most of
 the farms are small they employ very  
 few people.Most of the workers seem to
 be the families of the farmers.       
     There are also many nurseries and 
 market gardens here.One of the        
 nurseries is "East View".It sells a   
 variety of plants and vegetables in   
 large quantities to shops and markets.
 "Brynfields",a garden centre, grows   
 and sells to the public,unlike "East  
 View". Some market gardens grow just a
 few varieties of crops in large       
 amounts to sell to markets.Even though
 it seems we live out in the country we
 are only 12.25 miles from central     
 London.                               </content>
