		<content> Plover Scar light is unmanned and lit 
 by Calor gas.  Cockersand lighthouse  
 was built in 1847 and is lit by       
 electricity. There are sinking sands  
 in the estuary: training walls were   
 built in 1860/62.  There are seven    
 buoys all lit because of increaing    
 numbers of pleasurecraft.  They are   
 pontoon buoys - more stable.  There is
 a lighted Perch.  There are two river 
 pilots, one based at Glasson Dock and 
 one at Sunderland Point.  A submarine 
 pipeline is now disused.  The river   
 and navigational aids are maintained  
 by Lancaster Port Commissioners.
