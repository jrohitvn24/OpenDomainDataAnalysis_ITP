   resort when {Sir Richard Hotham}came
   at the end of the 18th century.He   
 built grand houses to impress rich    
 people and they would come and stay.In
 1876 the railway was built and this   
 presented an easier way to travel to  
 Bognor.In 1960 Butlins was built.It   
 has a theatre,swimming pools and      
 chalets to stay in.It was an enormous 
 tourist attraction.3,000,000 people   
 have stayed there since it was        
 built and it has 1600 chalets.Butlins 
 has recently been refurbished at a    
 cost of Â£1 million.There are also a   
 great number of camping and caravan   
 sites around{Bognor.
