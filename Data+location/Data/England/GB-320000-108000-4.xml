		<title>04Farms,Upper Otter:General</title>
		<content> Farms are not large.In the 9 square   
 kilometers of the valley there are    
 some 27 of them,mostly worked by the  
 farmer and his  family. Up on the high
 ground,though,they are larger and run 
 on more sophisticated and up-to-date  
 lines.                                
 Some of the buildings marked on the   
 O.S.map with their old farm-names are 
 in fact no longer working farms and   
 the surrounding fields no longer      
 belong to them.The house and barns    
 have been converted into much         
 sought-after country homes for people 
 whose work lies elsewhere.            
 Mostly,however,the farms are in the   
 hands of families who have worked in  
 the valley for several generations.
