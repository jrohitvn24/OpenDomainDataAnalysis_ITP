 an inglenook fireplace with an oven, a
 quarry_tiled floor, a scrubbed_topped 
 table and wooden chairs. Warming pans 
 of red_hot coals heated beds. Water   
 came from wells. Rainwater, collected 
 in a barrel, was used for the family  
 wash which was done in a copper heated

 annually, was a hole in the ground    
 with a seat. Families with 12 children
 were common. Vegetables and wheat were
 grown by each family. In{1985}houses

 televisions, stereo equipment, radios 
 and telephones. Beds have electric    
 blankets. Water is on tap in bathrooms
