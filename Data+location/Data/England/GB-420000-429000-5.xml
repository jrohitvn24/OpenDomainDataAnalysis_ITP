		<title>05FULNECK POTTERY</title>
		<content>  Having been established twenty years,
 the{FULNECK POTTERY,}owned by{MOLLIE  
{HILLAM,}a very experienced and skilled
 potter, has seen many changes of style
 over the years.When she first started,
 she made{domestic stoneware,}whereas  
 now most items are thinly potted      
{porcelain,}incised or embossed.       
  In her range of pottery there are    
{vases, pictures and plaques,}all of   
 which show her individual style of    
 designs based on{natural forms,}e.g.  
 delicate trees cut out of porcelain.  
  She has to work fast:"When once you  
 start a piece, you have to work on it 
 at once or it loses its character."   
  Her high quality work can be seen in 
 various galleries and shops throughout
 the{United Kingdom}and is exported    
 around the world, including such      
 countries as{Norway, Japan and West   
{Germany.  }                           </content>
