		<title>13THE DISUSED RAILWAY 2</title>
		<content> Since the track of the Lewes to       
 Uckfield Railway was taken away ithas 
 become an{interesting and popular walk
 especially along the embankment where 
 there is a good view of the country-  
 side around.{Children make great use  
 of this, playing on the remains and   
 the bridges. There are many wild      
 flowers and in autumn blackberries.   
 There are{old crossing keeper's and   
{signalman's houses at Hamsey.}One has 
 been{converted and extended,}the other
 is being rebuilt at the moment.       
 In 1983 one of the small stations to  
 the north of this block at Isfeild was
 bought by the Milham family. They have
 restored it and renamed it the        
{Lavender Line. On Sundays steam       
{engines run}and the public may now    
 come and ride on a short section of   
 track for no charge.
