		<title>08Gristhorpe Village.</title>
		<content>   The village is served by doctors in 
 Filey and there is a prescription     
 service by voluntary collectors from  
 the village.Because there is not an   
 appointment system patients find it   
 both time consuming and inconvenient  
 to visit the doctors.                 
   The new by-pass has taken away from 
 the village many of the buses which   
 used to go through it.Elderly         
 residents particularly find it        
 difficult as they have to walk further
 and there is no shelter.              
   There is a village hall which is    
 available to residents for functions  
 and events.It is used by the W.I.,the 
 Youth Club and for various parties and
 brownie and cub 'camps'.              
   The cricket club supports a 1st and 
 2nd team,the ground being 'lent' by   
 Mr.Alfred Hood of Town Farm.
