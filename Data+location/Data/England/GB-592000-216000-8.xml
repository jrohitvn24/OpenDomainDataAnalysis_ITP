		<title>08THE WHITE HORSE PUB</title>
		<content>  The landlord of the White Horse Pub  
 has worked there 7 years and he is a  
 Londoner. He said that he gets local  
 customers and passing travellers. The 
 White Horse Pub is on the road going  
 between Colchester and Tiptree.       
          {Forge Cottages}             
 Originally it was 4 cottages, then    
 2, now 1 dwelling. Mr.Hunnabal bought 
 it 17 years ago. His neighbour died 14
 years ago so Mr.Hunnabal bought his   
 house and made it into one dwelling.  
 There is a brick shed on the roadside 
 which is thought to be the original   
 forge. People travelled from London   
 to Layer Marney Towers and the horses 
 were shod at the forge. Built in the  
 wall of the shed is a Victorian       
 letterbox.                            
         {  Smythe's Green }

 common land.It is not used by anybody.</content>
