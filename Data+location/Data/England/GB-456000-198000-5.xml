		<title>05THE VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content>The Village Green which at 24 acres is 
one of the largest in the country has  
remained virtually unchanged for many  
hundreds of years. 49 houses surround  
it including only 7 less than 20 years 
old; many being over 200 years old.    
Bisecting the Green is a stream which  
flows through a variety of trees, wild 
flowers and grasses. 3 farmers have the
hay rights and, historically, those who
live on the Green (commoners) enjoy    
grazing rights. Some do try to extend  
their land by encroaching on the Green,
but local vigilance ensures little     
success in this respect. By ancient law
the Green is common land, open to all. 
It includes a cricket field crossed    
near the boundary by the council road, 
the Council choosing to ignore the     
original track around the Green. Out-  
going batsmen have to cross this road  
to reach their dilapidated pavilion.   </content>
