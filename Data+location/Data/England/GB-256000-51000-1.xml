{Yealmpton}is a village situated 7     
 miles (11kms) South-east of Plymouth  
 on the A379 Plymouth to Kingsbridge   
 road.                                 
 The {River Yealm,}which rises on      
 Dartmoor passes through the village   
 and flows into the sea at Wembury Bay.
 The population has steadily grown     
 during the last 15 years because of   
 the several new housing estates and is
 approximately 2000.                   
 In addition to being a traditionaly   
 rural community supporting several    
 thriving farms,Yealmpton also supports
 a few country crafts,small businesses 
 and a little light industry.          
 In common with many other pretty      
 villages in the area, Yealmpton serves
 as a{"dormitory-village"}for many     
 Plymouth workers.                     </content>
