		<title>13CHURCH AND CHAPEL IN BEMPTON</title>
		<content>      As with most modern communities, 
 religion does not take a high priority
 with most people. In spite of this,   
 both St. Michael's Church (C of E) and
 the Methodist Chapel have regular     
 congregations.                        
      The vicar, the Rev. Hirst, is    
 also the vicar of Flamborough and the 
 Methodist minister, the Rev. Lewis, is
 also in charge of a much larger area  
 than just our parish.                 
      The first Confirmation Service   
 for over ten years was held at St.    
 Michael's during May of this year when
 thirteen people joined full membership
 of the Church. In November of last    
 year a church choir was brought into  
 being by the assistant curate the Rev.
 Artley. The Methodist Chapel has a    
 Sunday School with around six pupils.
