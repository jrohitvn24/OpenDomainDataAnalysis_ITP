 I am the proud owner of a 12.2 h.h    
 blacky-brown{pony.}She lives out at   
 day and in at night.                  
                                       
 There are about{25 ponies and horses  
 in this village and the outlying      
 farms. Most local farms have a pony or
 a horse.                              
                                       
 There is a{pony club}at{Glaisdale,    
{Lythe, Goathland}and{Robin-Hoods Bay. 
 They have quite a large membership and
 the best one is supposed to be        
{Goathland.                            
                                       
 There are lots of horses and ponies at
{Egton show}with classes such as "Tack 
 and Turn-out" and Jumping. There is   
 always a raffle for a pony and I go in
 for it.      By Jenefer Hall          </content>
