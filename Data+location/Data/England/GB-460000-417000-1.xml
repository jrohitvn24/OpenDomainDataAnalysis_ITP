		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content>  THIS IS  AN AREA OF FLAT,            
 PREDOMINANTLY ARABLE FARMLAND, IN     
 PARTS OF HUMBERSIDE, NORTH YORKSHIRE  
 AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE,  AND IN THE      
 PARISHES OF POLLINGTON, BALNE,        
 SYKEHOUSE AND FENWICK. IT IS CROSSED  
 BY THE RIVER WENT WHICH FORMS THE     
 BOUNDARY BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH      
 YORKSHIRE. TRADITIONALLY CATTLE ARE   
 GRAZED ON THE RIVER BANKS.            
  UP TO WORLD WAR II THERE WAS         
 CONSIDERABLY MORE TREE COVER, BUT     
 DURING THE WAR MUCH WAS REMOVED, USING
 LABOUR PROVIDED BY GERMAN PRISONERS OF
 WAR, MAKING MORE LAND AVAILABLE FOR   
 GROWING FOOD.                         
  THE AREA IS SPARSELY POPULATED _     
 DWELLINGS BEING MAINLY LARGE          
 FARMSTEADS, AND COTTAGES FOR          
 AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. STRICT PLANNING 
 CONTROLS HAVE MEANT THAT THERE ARE    
 ALMOST NO RECENTLY BUILT HOUSES.      </content>
