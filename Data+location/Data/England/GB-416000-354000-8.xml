		<title>08MANOR FARM AND CROSSLOW FARM</title>
		<content> We live at Manor Farm in Alsop en le  
 Dale. My dad has about 200 acres. He  
 has about 50 pigs, 252 sheep and 28   
 cows. We use all our fields for grass 
 to feed the animals. We have no help  
 on the farm, just me, my dad, my      
 brother and my mum.                   
                                       
 We take the cows and sheep to sell at 
 Bakewell market. A man comes to take  
 the pigs to Derby. The sheep have     
 their lambs in March. We keep them all
 Winter and sell them the following    
 year.                                 
                                       
 Cross Low Farm is my granddad's farm. 
 It is a dairy farm and he milks 100   
 cows. A tanker lorry comes to collect 
 the milk about 10.00a.m. every day.   
                                       
 My granddad gets up at 5.00a.m. He has
 got seven tractors, all Fords.        </content>
