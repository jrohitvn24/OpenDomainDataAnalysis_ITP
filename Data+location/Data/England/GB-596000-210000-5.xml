		<content> There  are many types of houses in the
 village.   There are some council     
 houses most of which have now been    
 bought.   There is one block of flats 
 near the swimming pool which are owner
 occupied.    There are lots of        
 semi_detached, detached, terraced and 
 a few farmhouses.   There are also    
 some houses which date back to the    
 sixteenth century and seventeenth     
 century.   There are about three      
 housing estates the biggest with about
 a hundred houses.   Over the last     
 twenty years Tollesbury has changed   
 considerably because of new           
 developments and more people moving   
 in.   There was also a lot of building
 about the nineteen hundreds when      
 Tollesbury was a fishing village.     
 here are some typical house prices in 
 the area:   Semi_detached... Â£30.000  
             detached ........Â£55.000  </content>
