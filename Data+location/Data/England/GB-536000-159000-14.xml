		<title>14Farleigh Church</title>
		<content>St Marys Church in the quiet village of
Farleigh,is set in the heart of the    
Surrey countryside.It has been standing
there for 900 years,since 1082.The     
style was brought over from France by  
the Normans.Inside there are a few     
ornaments and decorative,brass,memorial
plaques.The bell tower has only one    
bell which is rung by a rope hanging   
behind the sturdy,wooden door which    
opens into the church.The porch is not 
as old as the church.It was built only 
400 years ago.There was a fire there   
which completely ruined the original   
roof,so it was rebuilt.Inside there is 
a faint smell of dampness.There are two
electric lights and a compline service 
is lit by candles.There is a vestry    
which is on the right after the small  
organ.Left and right of the front porch
there are wooden benches.These would be
fairly new.                            </content>
