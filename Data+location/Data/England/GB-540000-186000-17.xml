		<content>   Media is the press, radio and       
 television. From these we can learn   
 about things around the world. Some of
 the national newspapers are the       
 Sun, Mirror, Guardian and The Times.We
 get free newspapers through our       
 door. They have adverts as well as    
 local news. The newspapers often have 
 a different version of the same story 
 but with still the same facts.        
 "Jackie" is a girls' magazine.It has  
 stories, a horoscope and a problem    
 page.The "Look in" is a magazine for  
 boys and girls.It has stories like the
 A-Team, Supergran, Street Hawk and    
 Cannon and Ball. Dora and Russell from
 Nightingale Primary School really     
 enjoy doing the Quick Quizzes as there
 are always prizes to be won.
