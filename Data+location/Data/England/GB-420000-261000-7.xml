 Why did you choose to live with       
 animals?{Because I've always liked    
{them.}Could you explain a bit about   
 your voluntary work with animals,how  
 you come to get them &amp; what you do    
 when you get these poor little        
 creatures.{I take in cruelty cases,   
{sometimes they are the subject of     
{prosecution,because I have the        
{facilities I am asked to take in the  
{bigger cases,i.e.goats,pigs,sheep,    
{horses,ponies,donkeys etc.,the small  
{animals are those that cross my path, 
{cats,kittens,birds,squirrels etc.What 
{I try to do is to return them to the  
{wild when they are cured I don't like 
{penning any creature...}From this lady
 the teenagers of the village also     
 benefit. She finds employment on a    
 casual basis for them,not only finding
 them something to do,interesting them.</content>
