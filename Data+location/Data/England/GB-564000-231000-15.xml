		<content> Life in a rural area can be full and  
 active.People are to be seen driving  
 into the village for meetings,art and 
 clay modelling classes and other      
 cultural activities.Or they may be en 
 route for workers educational classes 
 at Radwinter or Cambridge or adult    
 education at Saffron Walden.Walking is
 popular;and there are field sports,   
 shooting for game and,after the       
 harvest,hunting with the East/Essex.  
 Special events may be organised for   
 fun or to raise funds,such as the     
 recent sponsored cycle ride in which  
 energetic cyclists toured churches in 
 the area in support of the Friends of 
 Essex Churches.People may also belong 
 to local societies such as the        
 Sampfords Society or the Great        
 Bardfield Historical Society.Local    
 women collect wild fruits and berries 
 to delight the eye and appetite.      </content>
