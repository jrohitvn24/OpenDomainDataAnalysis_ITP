		<content> THE THREE VILLAGES EACH HAVE A POST   
 OFFICE/GENERAL STORE.                 
 THE POST OFFICES ARE  OPEN MON TO SAT 
 9.OO TO 5.30. THEY HAVE A MIXED GROUP 
 OF CUSTOMERS BUT POSSIBLY MAINLY OLDER
 PEOPLE.THURSDAY IS THEIR BUSIEST DAY  
 BECAUSE THIS IS PENSION DAY AND MANY  
 OLD PEOPLE COLLECT THEIR PENSIONS AND 
 DO SOME SHOPPING.ALLTHE POST OFFICES  
 SPECIALISE IN SELLING CARDS,          
 STATIONARY, TOYS &amp; FANCY GOODS.       
 TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WORK IN THE SHOPS.
 THE POST OFFICES IN EAST CHINNOCK AND 
 COKER GET A LOT OF PASSING TRADE ON "A
 30" BUT HARDINGTON HAS LITTLE TRADE   
 EXCEPT FROM THE VILLAGE.
