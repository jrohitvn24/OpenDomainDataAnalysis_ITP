{END OF WALNEY ISLAND.                 
 The sea around the south end of Walney
 Island is mainly used for pleasure    
 craft.Piel deepwater channel has      
 attracted the shipbuilding company of 
 Vickers Ltd. because it is an ideal   
 place in which to launch ships and    
 submarines.In the 19th century the    
 channel was used regularly by hundreds
 of iron-ore boats.This made the       
 protection provided by the Walney     
 Lighthouse especially important.      
 The majority of the pleasure craft    
 mentioned above are moored at the     
 marina/boat-club on Roa Island.       
 Surprisingly little commercial fishing
 is done in this region,however,there  
 are many pleasure-only anglers to be  
 found here every weekend.
