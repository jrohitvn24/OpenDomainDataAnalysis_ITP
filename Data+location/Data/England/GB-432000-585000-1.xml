		<content> Newbiggin Point with the church as a  
 landdmark, has been an important point
 for shipping since medieval times when
 Newbiggin was a town.Even in the early
 nineteenth century there was a harbour
 at the mouth of the Wansbeck. Grain   
 aad grindstones were exported as well 
 as coal. The Wansbeck ws much used by 
 fishing boats but recently the barier

 caused the restriction of crossing the
 baar to 2 hours only on high tide. So 
 there are now more rod fishermen. A   
 very common activity is the recoveryy 
 of sea coal in large quantities after 
 the tide has fallen. Heavy seas have

 new defences have been necessary. The 
 area has very high scenic value and   
 providdes for a variety of leisure    
 activity including
