		<content>{Crudwell village hall}used to be a    
 chapel.There are four old graves next 
 to it in the long grass.The site was  
 purchased in the 1920's by members    
 of two local families and{given to the
{villagers to use for a meeting place. 
 It is easy to find as there is a sign 
 outside which says Crudwell Village   
 Hall.Inside there are toilets, a      
 kitchen and a large hall with a stage.
 In the backyard there is a shed where 
 the cubs and scouts keep their camping
 equipment.The{playgroup}is held in the
 hall on three mornings each week.Their
 many toys are stored under the stage. 
 Other regular users include{cubs,     
{scouts,ballet and the Parish Council. 
 Sometimes the brownies hire the hall  
 for a disco or competition.Private    
 parties and discos also take place    
 from time to time.
