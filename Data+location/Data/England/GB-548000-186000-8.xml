		<content> My mum,Lynne, works at the Dolphin    
 Leisure Centre.The Dolphin has a new  
 swimming pool(with a wave machine),a  
 sauna,an aerobics centre and a        
 restaurant.It is in central Romford   
 near the market.My mum is a cashier   
 receptionist and she gives information
 about the centre.She wears a          
 uniform,which is a navy blue skirt,a  
 white blouse and a navy blue blazer   
 that has a picture of a Dolphin and   
 the word'Dolphin'printed on it.She    
 works different hours at the          
 centre,anytime from 8.3Oa.m. to 1Op.m.
          Swimming is a popular hobby  
 with children of the area.Many visit  
 local pools once or twice a           
 week.Another new pool is in Dagenham  
 at Becontree Heath.Pupils from Robert 
 Clack Comprehensive School have their 
 swimming lessons here.
