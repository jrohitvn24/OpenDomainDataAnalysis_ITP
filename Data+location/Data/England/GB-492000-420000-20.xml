		<title>20FUTURE PROSPECTS</title>
		<content> The electronic age has arrived in Win-
 teringham this year with the  install-
 ation on top of the church  tower of a
 self contained navigational  aid owned
 and operated  by the Humber Port Auth-
 ority.This may be an indication of the
 direction the future  of  Winteringham
 will take.  For  centuries much of its
 prosperity depended on the river. With
 enforced  greater  leisure time can we
 see an  increasing return to the river
 to service leisure  pursuits?  Country
 crafts abounded  in  days  gone by and
 the  village  still has more craftsmen
 both professional and amateur than its
 population today  warrants, will these
 crafts further develop  to furnish the
 know-how for the ever_nearer towns and
 cities?  As a residential area it will
 certainly flourish, new roads will en-
 sure new residents and leisure seekers
 a-plenty in the days to come.         </content>
