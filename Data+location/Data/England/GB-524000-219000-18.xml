		<title>18Stevenage New Town</title>
		<content> Stevenage is a new town.  The part    
 we have investigated is mostly housing
 but some land is used for agriculture 
 and there is an 18 hole council owned 
 golf course too.                      
 This part of Stevenage has been built 
 in the last twenty-five years and some
 parts are very recent.  Most of the   
 houses were built by the council.  It 
 is planned carefully to be as         
 attractive as possible.  There are    
 lots of open spaces and parks and the 
 council plants trees and shrubs and   
 keeps the town clean.  The town is    
 designed for safety.  Cycle tracks    
 follow most of the main roads and     
 there are many underpasses and        
 pedestrian crossings.                 
 Each neighbourhood has its own shops. 
 The shops might include a supermarket,
 chemist, newsagents, hairdressers and 
 takeaway food shops.                  </content>
