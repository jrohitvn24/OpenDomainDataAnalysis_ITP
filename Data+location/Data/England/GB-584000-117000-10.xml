		<content> Until l974 our own primary school     
 children (5_11yrs) attended our own   
 little village school.  But when the  
 roll went down to 23 the school was   
 closed down.  Now seven children go to
 the schools in Rye, 3 miles to the    
 east, and seven to Brede C.P. School, 
 3 miles to the west.  Four children go
 to private schools.  The secondary age
 children nearly all go to Thomas      
 Peacocke Comprehensive School in Rye. 
 Most leave at 16 after taking GCE 'O' 
 level or CSE exams, but about a third 
 stay on till 18 to take 'A' levels, or
 go to the Hastings College of Further 
 Education for special vocational      
 courses.  A very few go on to Univer_ 
 sity to take degrees. Four girls go to
 private boarding schools, coming home 
 at weekends. There are at present 22  
 children in this age_group.
