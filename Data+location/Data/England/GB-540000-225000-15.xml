		<content>  Rayment's Brewery was built in l860  
 although there has been a brewery in  
 the area for hundreds of years. The   
 present Brewery employs 57 people and 
 owns 20 properties in the village     
 where employees live.                 
  Green King took over the Brewery but 
 they still brew Pelham Ales on the    
 site and there is a warehouse storing 
 bottled alchohol and soft drinks.     
  The buildings comprise an office     
 block, brewery, keg store and         
 warwhouse. Water is obtained from an  
 artesian well underneath the brewery. 
  All the employees live locally even  
 the managers.                         
  There are eight large lorries and two
 small ones delivering over an area    
 which extends south as far as the     
 Thames.
