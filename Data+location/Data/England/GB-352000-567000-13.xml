 sheep and cattle. He starts work at   
 6.30am. They have a cow called Mary.  
 His farm is called Askerton Castle.   
 They have calves and hens.Mr. Robinson
 comes in and has this breakfast at    
 7.30am.For breakfast he has bacon and 
 2 eggs,tea and toast. Normally that's 
 over by  8.00 am. Then he goes back   
 to his work.He looks at the sheep and 
 cattle to see if they are all there   
 and he sees if they are lame.Sheep    
 sometimes fall over and it is called  
 "cast".If they are like that for 4    
 hours they will die.He goes in for a  
 cup of coffee at 9.45am.At 10.00 he   
 cleans ditches and mends fences.Then
