 a combined grocers and post office,the
 other an antique shop.The former      
 keeps a small stock of all the        
 necessary grocery items which are     
 mostly purchased from Carlisle by the 
 shop keeper.The postman brings        
 newspapers and comics which have been 
 previously ordered, he picks these up 
 in Penrith after they have come from  
 Carlisle by train.The post office     
 carries the usual stock of stamps and 
 cards and is responsible for Family   
 Allowance and old Age pension payments
 The Antique shop was opened in 1970   
 and is stocked from local salerooms   
 mainly small items.Trade is largely   
 with other dealers and through the    
 Antique Fairs in Cumbria.There is a   
 small tourist trade and the shop is
