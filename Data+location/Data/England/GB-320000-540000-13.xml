		<title>13Domestic Pets.</title>
		<content> At our school the most popular pet is 
 the gold fish.Dogs and cats are also  
 popular. Three people have budgerigars
 and one person has a guinea pig.      
 Recently two of the children got two  
 gerbils as pets and brought them to   
 school for us to see.One child's      
 father has a pet rat.My pet is a      
 cavalier King Charles'spaniel.I call  
 him Jody.He is tall for his age,thirty
 eight centimetres high, though he is  
 only two years old.When I get home    
 from school I get changed, have my tea
 and then go out to play. Then I take  
 my dog for a walk. I also have four   
 gold fish which I feed each day. If   
 you want to buy a pet you have to go  
 to Carlisle as there are no pet shops 
 in Fletchertown.I used to have some   
 rabbits as pets.I play with Jody until
 20.00 hours then I watch television   
 and go to bed at about 22.00 hours.   </content>
