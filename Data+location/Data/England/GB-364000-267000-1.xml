		<content> THE AREA IS BISECTED BY THE RIVER TEME
 WITH THE VALLEY FLOOR BEING           
 INTENSIVELY FARMED WITH HOPS, CORN AND
 GRASS.  THE GROUND SLOPES GENTLY UP   
 THROUGH ORCHARDS ON THE NORTH, AND    
 MORE STEEPLY WITH WOODS AND GRASSLAND,
 ON THE SOUTH. FARMS,SMALLHOLDINGS AND 
 COTTAGES ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER WITH A
 CLUSTER OF DWELLINGS AT HIGHWOOD, A   
 GROUP OF COUCIL HOUSING AT EASTHAM,   
 AND A VILLAGE AT NEWNHAM BRIDGE WITH  
 TWO PUBS,A SHOP AND POST OFFICE. IN   
 SPRING AND DURING THE HOP             
 HARVEST,CARAVAN ENCAMPMENTS OF CASUAL 
 WORKERS APPEAR,BUT MANY PEOPLE        
 RESIDENT IN THE AREA NOW WORK OUTSIDE 
 THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND COMMUTE 
 TO THE BLACK COUNTRY, OR ARE SELF     
 EMPLOYED.THE VALLEY IS VERY BEAUTIFUL,
 SCENICALLY AND ATTRACTS MANY VISITORS 
 ESPECIALLY AT BLOSSOM TIME.
