		<content>  Residents dig up oyster shells in    
 their gardens, apparently a sign of   
 Roman occupation.All but 4 families in
 the old farming community died during 
 the Black Death.Hangleton did not     
 develop until 1931,now ten thousand   
 people live there.Twenty houses are   
 being built now on the land available.
  St Helen's Church celebrated its     
 900th anniversary with a Gift Day and 
 Flower Festival.The Hangleton Project 
 is based at the Church Hall to        
 encourage local groups and runs a     
 community cafe.Hangleton Community    
 Association is looking for premises.  
  Hangleton Manor dated 1545 is the    
 oldest building in Hove.A 2 year,     
 Â£9 000 project is underway to restore 
 the dovecote.                         
  Residents enjoy free access to the   
 Downs for recreation and are worried  
 about the proposed Brighton by-pass.  </content>
