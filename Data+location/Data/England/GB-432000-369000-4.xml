		<title>04HOUSING - WEST CHESTERFIELD</title>
		<content>   {Old Brampton}is a small ribbon     
 settlement 1 mile NE of Chesterfield. 
 Some of the properties are very old.  
 The houses are very expensive, around 
 Â£80 000. The population is very stable
 and not many of the houses come up for
 sale. The main type of people who live
 here are retired folk as well as      
 commuters who travel into Sheffield.  
    The{Somersall}area has different   
 types of housing. The main tenure is  
 owner occupied. The houses at one end 
 of Somersall Lane are very large,     
 detached dwellings. They have         
 extensive gardens front and back. The 
 prices are around Â£80 000-Â£90 000. At 
 the other end of Somersall Lane the   
 houses change. These houses are much  
 smaller and are a mixture of detached 
 and semi-detached. The amount of land 
 is less and so the prices are cheaper,
 around Â£35 000.                       </content>
