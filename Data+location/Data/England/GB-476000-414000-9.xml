		<content>     As this block is primarily        
 agricultural land, there is only one  
 main road passing through it: the     
 A 161 which takes traffic from        
 Gainsborough in the South and Goole in
 the North. Although much of the       
 traffic for the docks of Goole now    
 uses the Motorway route, the road     
 still carries a lot of traffic between
 towns and villages along the '161' and
 on its way to Scunthorpe or Doncaster.
     Off the A 161 there is also a     
 network of agricultural by-roads      
 maintained by Boothferry Borough      
 Council. It provides an invaluable    
 link for the farmers between their    
 fields and the main roads and         
 transport routes(it is only three     
 miles to the M180).                   
     The railway link through this     
 block was axed in the '60s by Dr      
 Beaching.                             </content>
