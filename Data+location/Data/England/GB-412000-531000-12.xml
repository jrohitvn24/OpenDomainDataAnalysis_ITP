		<title>12An interview with the Vicar</title>
		<content>{Mr Taylor}is the {vicar}of both{      
{Howden-le-Wear}and{Witton-le-Wear}.He 
 became a vicar in{1973}.He thought God
 wanted him to become a vicar so he    
 went to college to learn about{The    
{Bible,the church and what a vicar     
{does}.After that the{Bishop of        
{Lichfield}thought it was right for him
 to become a vicar so he held an{      
{ordination}.When someone becomes a    
 vicar in the Church of England they   
 are first of all made a{deacon ,}and  
 then made a{priest}.This is done at a 
 sevice called ordination, where we    
 ask God to help the deacon or priest  
 to do their work for him. In his      
 spare time he plays with his children 
 or goes for walks, reads books and    
 listens to records.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
