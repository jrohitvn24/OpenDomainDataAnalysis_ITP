		<title>01Introduction - Horsmonden</title>
		<content>Our area consists of the village of    
Horsmonden and surrounding farms and   
countryside. It has several shops,     
three smallish factories, a primary    
school and two doctors surgeries. There
is one large housing estate and three  
smaller ones. There are three public   
houses, one of which used to be a      
Coaching inn. Horsmonden stands on the 
by-road that joins Tunbridge Wells to  
Cranbrook. The population is about     
1900. Horsmonden has three churches, a 
Roman Catholic, a Methodist and a      
Church of England. The Anglican church 
is called St Margaret's and is two     
miles South of the village. The        
village was built round the iron       
industry centred at the Furnace Pond,  
half a mile to the North-West, where   
they cooled the iron. The River Teise  
runs though our area and later joins   
the Medway.                            </content>
