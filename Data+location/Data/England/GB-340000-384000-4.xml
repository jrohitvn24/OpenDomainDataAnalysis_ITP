		<title>04Changing Times In Woolton</title>
		<content>   Since the end of the war Corporation
 estates have been built in Woolton and
 blocks of high-storey{flats.}The very 
 old village houses still remain. The  
 Woolton Village Club holds its        
 Centenary this year. The Post Office  
 remained a sub-office until 1963 when 
 the modern crown office was opened.   
   Many people remember the{trams}     
 swaying along Menlove Avenue. They    
 brought many children to Woolton Woods
 in the summer holidays. Buses replaced
 the trams in 1949. The advent of the  
 modern Washeteria is another instance 
 of change. The modern disposal motor  
 vans used by the dustmen are a great  
 change from the horsedrawn carts.     
 Woolton has also become a{smokeless   
{zone.}                                
   Sainsbury's new{shopping precinct}  
 has brought much more traffic to the  
 village.         J.E.PARRY.           </content>
