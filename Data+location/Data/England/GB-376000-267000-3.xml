		<title>03(CONT.) ASTLEY (NOT ON MAP)</title>
		<content>   The eastern boundary of Astley is   
 formed by the{RIVER SEVERN,}but as    
 the land between the B4196 and the    
 Severn is not in this block a very    
 brief description only of the area    
 must suffice. {                       
{  ASTLEY BURF}is a sizeable hamlet    
 which grew up as a result of the      
 ferry-crossing at{HAMPSTALL}and the   
{HAMSTALL INN}is still a popular venue.
 Recent building has almost doubled the
 population of The Burf and a{vineyard}
 has been established there as a       
 commercial concern.                   
   Further North up the Severn lies the
{SEVERN VALLEY SAND AND GRAVEL QUARRY }
 and the {SEVERN ARTSTONE CO.}which    
 deals in pre-cast concrete. These     
 two give employment to many local     
 people. Nearby is a system of caves   
 known as {REDSTONE CAVES,}reputedly an
{ancient Hermitage.       }            </content>
