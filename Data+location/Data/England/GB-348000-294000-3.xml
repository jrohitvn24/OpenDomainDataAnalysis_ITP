		<title>03RAISING TURKEYS AT HILLEND</title>
		<content>    September is here once more with   
 the familiar sound of turkeys chirping
 happily as they settle into their new 
 surroundings. We rear 100 each year   
 for the Christmas market.Their home   
 for the first 6 weeks, is a redundant 
 stock lorry container which protects  
 them against rats and cats. They soon 
 begin to eat a vast amount of food and
 grow very quickly. They are then moved
 to a large building up the hill.      
                                       
  Their short life ends when we begin  
 killing them,a week before Christmas. 
 This is our busiest time,the run up to
 the festive season.My husband,four    
 children and myself have to work long 
 hours,plucking,dressing and presenting
 the oven-ready turkeys to our many    
 faithful customers.
