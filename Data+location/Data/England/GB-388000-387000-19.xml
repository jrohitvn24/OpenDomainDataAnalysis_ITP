		<title>19THE DIALSTONE CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Dialstone Centre was built as a   
 school in 1934. It remained a school  
 for 49 years and then in 1983, because
 of falling rolls at the school and at 
 the neighbouring Goyt Bank            
 Comprehensive, the two schools were   
 amalgamated to form{Offerton High     
{School.}This new school occupies the  
 former Goyt Bank site. The old        
{Dialstone School}once held over 1000  
 pupils and nearly 60 staff.           
 The Centre's new main use is as a     
{Teachers' Centre}with a{Youth Club    
 being held on two weekday evenings.   
 The Sports Hall and gymnasium are     
 often booked by local clubs but there 
 are plans to further develop these    
 sports facilities and it is to be     
 designated a 'centre of excellence'   
 for gymnastics. A library may be      
 opened here in a few years time.
