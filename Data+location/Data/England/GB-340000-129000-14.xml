		<content> 100 households within the area were   
 surveyed with the following results:  
 nearly every household has at least 1 
 car, with 50% having 2 or more cars.  
 The majority of people surveyed use   
 their car for work and to go shopping.
 Bus services are limited to one bus a 
 week, on Thursday, which goes to the  
 local town, Langport, waits 2 hours   
 and then returns. Cars are an         
 essential part of village life. Many  
 families also own bicycles for        
 travelling within the local area. 2 of
 the people surveyed cycle to work and 
 3 walk. 75% of the children at the    
 Primary School come to school by car. 
 The remaining children cycle or walk  
 to school. The older children are     
 taken to and from Huish Episcopi      
 Comprehensive School by bus. There is 
 1 garage in High Ham which sells      
 petrol and offers a repair service.   </content>
