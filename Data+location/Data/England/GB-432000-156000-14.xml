 In Vernham Dean there are very        
 few self employed people as there     
 is no local work except for farm      
 workers. With the exception of one    
 self employed builder and a self      
 employed wine merchant ,the  majority 
 commute to nearby towns such as       
 Andover, Newbury,  Basingstoke or even
 London.                               
                                       
  Most families have two cars, one for 
 the working member of the family to   
 get to work, the other usually for the
 wife to either travel to work or for  
 shopping or taking children to school.
