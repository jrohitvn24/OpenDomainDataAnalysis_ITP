   Every Monday and Friday, at about   
 half past three,the baker's van comes 
 round.He sells crisps,pasties,tinned  
 vegetables,cornflakes,coffee,tea      
 and eggs ,as well as bread and        
 teacakes.                             
   On Wednesday the grocer's van       
 comes.He sells fruit, vegetables,     
 fizzy drinks and groceries.           
   The butcher comes on a Thursday     
 morning.He sells liver, beef, pork,   
 chicken, meat pies and eggs.          
   The butcher has the smallest van.It 
 is a sort of car with a raised        
 back,like a boot with shelves.You can 
 get inside the baker's van and the    
 butcher's van.                        
   It is easier for my mum to shop at  
 the vans because she can't drive, so  
 she can't get to the proper shops.
