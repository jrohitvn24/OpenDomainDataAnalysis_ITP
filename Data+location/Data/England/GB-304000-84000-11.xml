		<title>11 POPULATION IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>East Budleigh is the largest           
settlement. Its population in 1981     
was 82O. From 68O in 1931,it dropped   
as agricultural employment             
opportunities declined,but rose from   
1961 to 1971 with increasing popularity
for retirement and homes for commuters;
the latter are an increasingly mobile  
group.Now,around 5O% of the population 
are retired and our survey showed that 
46% of those questioned had lived in   
the village for only 1Oyrs or less.This
is a feature of East Devon's           
population.Yettington is a small hamlet
of some 2O houses;many are farms and   
others are being gentrified.The        
remaining people in the area live on   
scattered farms.There is a large       
temporary population with the students 
of Bicton College and summer influx of 
tourists and other students.
