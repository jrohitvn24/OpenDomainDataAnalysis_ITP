		<title>08Special Education in Medway</title>
		<content> The Bligh Tutorial Unit in west Strood
 caters for 36 children from the Medway
 area who have learning difficulties.  
 They attend the unit usually for about
 eighteen months and then are able to  
 return to their original schools.     
 Fulmar School in west Strood is for   
 children with severe learning         
 difficulties (severely mentally       
 handicapped, some of whom are also    
 physically handicapped). Nearly 100   
 children, aged 5 _ 19, attend, from   
 all over Gravesham, Medway and        
 Gillingham. Many people from the local
 area give valuable help to the school.
 The school moved into new             
 purpose-built accommodation in 1984,  
 with very many special facilities for 
 the handicapped. Most children are    
 taught individually, learning to      
 communicate and look after themselves.
