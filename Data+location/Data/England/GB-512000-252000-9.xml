 listen to a story.At 9.30 we have     
 Topic Studies.At the moment we are    
 learning about villages.Then we have  
 Bible Story for thirty minutes.After a
 break in the playground we come in and
 collect our sports bags to go to get  
 changed for games.The games change    
 with the seasons.At the moment we are 
 doing cricket.At 12.00 we have our    
 dinner.School starts again at 1.00    
 when we have a double lesson of       
 Maths.We are working on averages now. 
 In the final lesson our teacher       
 sometimes reads us a story until 3.30.
 We then line up to catch the bus home.
