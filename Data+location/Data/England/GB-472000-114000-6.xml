		<content> In the past, most inhabitants were    
 farmers or agricultural labourers.    
 Today there are three farmers but     
 because of mechanisation and the      
 number of sons, they employ only six  
 men. Other occupations are:           
 barister, brewery director, naval     
 officer, lecturer, builder, IBM       
 manager and several retired. Few of   
 the wives work. One had been the      
 cookery editress of 'Woman's Weekly'. 
                                       
 The furthest distance travelled by    
 commuters was to London; otherwise    
 people worked at home or travelled an 
 average of 12 miles.
