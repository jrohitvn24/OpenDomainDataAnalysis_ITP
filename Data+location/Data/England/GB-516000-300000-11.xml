		<title>11A STREET IN DOGSTHORPE</title>
		<content>   Dovecote Close is a small winding   
 close off a main road called Welland  
 Road. There are no shops in the       
 street, although a short distance away
 can be found a supermarket. In the    
 close there are three kinds of house: 
 detached,semi-detached and terraced.  
 The majority of the houses are        
 semi-detached and they have been built
 to two basic designs. One of the      
 designs has no entrance hall and has  
 the stairs to the bedrooms in the main
 living room. The second design enables
 you to enter the house through a door 
 that leads into the kitchen. These    
 houses also have a main living room on
 the ground floor.                     
   Both designs of house have a similar
 second floor, each having a bathroom  
 with toilet and three bedrooms.
