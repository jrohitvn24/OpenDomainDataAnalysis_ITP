		<content> Most of the houses in Ford are        
 terraced.Some houses are three storeys
 high,because they are of a different  
 sort.They are sometimes older and have
 less room for gardens.The number of   
 small shops is less but there are more
 pubs. Much of the housing is not as   
 well maintained as the smaller        
 terraced housing, possibly this is    
 because they are not as often owner   
 occupied and the landlords do not     
 make sure the are well kept..
