		<title>01Martock and Stoke area</title>
		<content>     The countryside around Martock and
 Stoke-sub-Hamdon (Stoke) is mainly    
 farmland.  Most of it is permanent    
 pasture land.  It is used for cattle  
 and some dairy.  The main crops are   
 barley, wheat and sugarbeet.  They    
 also make a lot of silage and hay.    
 Martock is a growing village as       
 several new estates have appeared in  
 the last few years.  It also has a lot
 of good amenities such as a fire      
 station, co-op, dentist, library etc. 
 Stoke is not as well equipped as      
 Martock but it has a country park     
 called Ham Hill and plenty of pubs.   
 Ham Hill is a popular walking place   
 and from the top you can see the whole
 area.  There are also a lot of Duchy  
 houses in Stoke (owned by the Prince  
 of Wales).  The A303 is a busy road.  
 It separates Stoke from Martock and   
 carries much holiday traffic.         </content>
