		<content> This block contains five reservoirs   
 covering approximately one square     
 kilometre in area. These are Digley,  
 Bilberry, Brownhill, Ramesden and part
 of Riding Wood. All are maintained and
 administered by the Yorkshire Water   
 Authority.                            
  Digley is the most recently          
 constructed and was completed in 1953.
 It is 800m long, 400m wide at its     
 widest and is approximately 45m deep  
 in places. It disperses 2,855,000     
 gallons of water each day and supplies
 much of the Huddersfield area. The    
 main pipeline is 10km long and 60cm in
 diameter. It cost Â£472,000 to build.  
 Additional work has increased this sum
 to Â£1,185,277.                        
  All of the reservoirs have woodland  
 plantations around them. All are      
 coniferous and the most common species
 are spruce and larch.                 </content>
