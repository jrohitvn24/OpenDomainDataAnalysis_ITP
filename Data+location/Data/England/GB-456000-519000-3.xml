		<title>03JOBS OR NO JOBS</title>
		<content> Most people are either unemployed and 
 looking for work or retired.Some have 
 jobs in the local I.C.I., in B.S.C.   
 Redcar,with the Electricity Board and 
 at a nearby Power Station.Most workers
 are manual,few people were            
 professional.There is no obvious work 
 for women apart from part-time jobs   
 such as cleaners and bar-maids.       
 Prospects for school-leavers are grim 
 with fewer openings for the young in  
 B.S.C. and I.C.I.Most people feel     
 strongly about unemployment and       
 expressed the views that the situation
 was deteriorating for young and old   
 and it is the governments business    
 to do something about it.Some were    
 optimistic in believing that jobs will
 come in time.There was no evidence of 
 "cottage industries" springing up as a
 response to unemployment except for   
 some small trade in allotment produce.</content>
