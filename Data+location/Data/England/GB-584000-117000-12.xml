		<content> Our main industry is farming, but     
 mechanisation  has meant that there   
 are far fewer employment opportunites 
 on the farms than there used to       
 be. A few people work in shops or     
 offices in Rye or Hastings, also in   
 the hotels and restaurants.  There is 
 usually casual work to be had picking 
 soft fruit or apples in the season.   
 Many young people, however, leave the 
 area altogether in order to seek      
 employment.  For this reason we are   
 now part of a 'Rural Development Area'
 for which government funds are to be  
 made available to help small indust_  
 ries get started.  Our old school     
 building is to be turned into craft   
 workshops.  The County Joinery, which 
 operates in the old Methodist Chapel, 
 employs four men.  It is just possible
 to commute to London to work. A few   
 men work for local building firms.    </content>
