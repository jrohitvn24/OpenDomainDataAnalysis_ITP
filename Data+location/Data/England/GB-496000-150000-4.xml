		<content>      Some of the houses in the extreme
 S.E. of the area are over 100 years   
 old. Most are much newer and houses   
 are still being built throughout the  
 area. Both the council and private    
 firms are developing waste and fringe 
 farming land. The Council has an      
 extensive modernization scheme under  
 way in their oldest estate at         
 Shepherds Hill, built in 1919. This   
 work includes providing indoor        
 toilets. Almost 8% of the housing in  
 the area is state owned.              
    There are no plans for further     
 large developments in the area as     
 building land is scarce, though the   
 vacated land at{Stoughton Barracks    
 would be an ideal site. Housing       
 throughout the area, both private and 
 state is mixed, each estate usually   
 having bungalows, semi-detached and   
 detached houses, and flats.           </content>
