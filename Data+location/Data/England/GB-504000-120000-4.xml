  The A29 main road from London to     
 Chichester crosses the block from SW  
 to NE and is almost straight. It      
 follows the course of the Roman Road  
 called Stane Street which connected   
 these towns.                          
  Whereas the resting places on the    
 Roman road were to the N and S of the 
 block, the modern staging post is the 
 Toat Cafe, which has ample parking    
 space for cars and heavy goods        
 vehicles                              
  On alternate Sundays a "car boot"    
 sale is held on the parking area which
 can develop into a small market.      
  A public house and a petrol filling  
 station cater for the thirsts of      
 modern chariots and their drivers.
