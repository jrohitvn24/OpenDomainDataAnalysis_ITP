		<title>05WENCHFORD PICNIC SITE</title>
		<content>   The Forestry Commission has provided
 a number of picnic sites in the forest
 and there is one alongside the B4431  
 road (Blakeney - Parkend) as it runs  
 up the deep valley between the Viney  
 and Blakeney Hills. It has been named 
 Wenchford by the Commission but it    
 is known locally as "The Straits".    
 Parking is provided along the         
 embankment of a former railway line   
 and between this track and the road,  
 Blackpool Brook winds its way towards 
 Blakeney. Here there are barbeques,   
 wooden picnic tables and toilet       
 facilities.                           
   Wenchford is a very pleasant place  
 to visit especially in the Autumn and 
 Spring seasons but can be rather      
 over-populated in the Summer months.  
 It as a playground for local children.
