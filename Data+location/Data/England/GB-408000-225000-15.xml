		<content> Farming is the biggest industry in the
 block we have studied.                
 Years ago the area was particularly   
 known for its sheep, but although     
 there are still a few flocks left most
 farms are now mainly arable growing   
 barley and oats for animal feed,      
 barley for malting and wheat for      
 flour. Some farms have a few fattening
 bullocks and others have turkeys which
 they feed up for Christmas.           
 Some of the farms have been in the    
 same hands for                        
 generations,particularly Home Farm at 
 Kineton and New Barn Farm in Temple   
 Guiting. Many of the ancestors of the 
 local villagers also used to work on  
 the farms before mechanisation reduced
 the numbers needed to just one or two.
