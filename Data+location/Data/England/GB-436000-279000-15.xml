		<content>  When I started cubs I was very       
 excited.I had to go for 8 weeks and   
 then had to pay Â£8.42 for a uniform   
 which was a cap,neck tie,woggle jumper
 and badges.I had to make a promise to 
 do my best,to do my duty to God and to
 the Queen,to help other people and to 
 keep the cub scout law.Each week we   
 attended cubs and worked to earn      
 badges.For my first badge I had to    
 plant 7 daffodils,4 sweet peas and 6  
 cabbages.Each week we had an          
 inspection to see who was the         
 tidiest.I earned an artists badge as  
 well.I had to draw lots of pictures.I 
 worked on getting my bronze badge.You 
 can get a bronze,silver and gold      
 badge.I had to do a lot of tests then 
 I got my bronze badge.I was very      
 pleased.
