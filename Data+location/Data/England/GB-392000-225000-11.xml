		<title>11OLDACRES,BISHOP'S CLEEVE</title>
		<content>{Oldacres}originally started the       
 business 60 years ago.They were       
 farmers who owned some of the land in 
 Bishop's Cleeve. The company which    
 W.J.Oldacre  founded,now makes animal 
 feed.They run seven mills which are   
 spread across the country.People who  
 live in Bishop's Cleeve can smell the 
 feed and hear the grinders.The large  
 mill here has six silos. It is a      
 highly automated business run by      
 computers. 85% of the feed is         
 delivered in bulk and the rest is put 
 in sacks. One room in the{Old Rectory 
{(now Oldacres}offices) has a picture  
 of Slad Valley painted on its         
 walls.The murals are in what is now   
 the boardroom where the shareholders  
 meet. Seven people work in the        
 laboratories where tests are done on  
 the feed.{Oldacres}send their experts 
 abroad to promote their skills.       </content>
