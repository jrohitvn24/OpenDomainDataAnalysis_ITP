		<title>05VILLAGE SHOP &amp; POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>  The present shop came into existence 
 14 years ago when the previous shop   
 was converted into a bungalow and the 
 barn next door was built onto to make 
 the shop.It sells general groceries   
 and wines and spirits and is also the 
 village post office. It stands north  
 of "the green" in Weasenham St Peter. 
 Outside is a post box and telephone   
 box.Thursday is pension day and the   
 busiest day in the shop.The post      
 office is very important in the       
 village.It is what encourages trade in
 the shop.The old folks are the chief  
 customers; younger people with cars   
 do the bulk of their shopping in the  
 towns.Children shop for sweets,soft   
 drinks and ice cream.Deliveries per   
 week are-groceries once,vegetables 3  
 times, bread daily.Most popular items-
 Frozen food-Fish fingers,Chips:Cereals
 Cornflakes:Biscuits Rich Tea.         </content>
