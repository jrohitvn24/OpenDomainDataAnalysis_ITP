		<content>    St. Giles' has records dating back 
 to 1540. The tower was added in the   
 14th. Century. The church was restored
 by the Victorians making the true age 
 of the church hard to trace. Six bells
 formally at Hampton in Arden &amp; cast in
 1725 were turned, tuned &amp; re-hung in a
 cast iron bell frame in St.Giles in   
 1977.The minute bell, the ancient     
 Nether Whitacre bell, was cast in     
 1612.                                 
    St. John's is thought to date from 
 the 14th. Century. The Adderley family
 moved to the Hams Estate in the early 
 17th. Century. The church &amp; Lea       
 Marston were part of the estate. This 
 remained so until the estate was sold 
 to Birmingham Corporation in 1919.    
 Many refurbishments were made during  
 the Victorian Era.                    
    The parishes of St. Giles' &amp; St.   
 John's are united under one incumbent.</content>
