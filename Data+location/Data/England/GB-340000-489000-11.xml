		<title>11Tourism Crosthwaite 'area'</title>
		<content>{Lambhowe Caravan Park}provides a 26   
 acre site for 112 privately owned     
 caravans which can be occupied from   
 March to October. The caravans have   
 electriciy which also provides street 
 lighting on site.Nowhere else in the  
 area has this facility. Cooking is by 
 Calor Gas; flush toilets are in most  
 vans; a public telephone box is       
 available and milk and eggs are sold. 
 All visitors bring most of their own  
 provisions from their own local       
 supermarkets but do make some use of  
 the two local stores in Crosthwaite   
 Village and at Bowland Bridge. There  
 is a bar on site with a room for      
 children. The site is advertised but  
 after 11 yrs. it has built up its own 
 reputation. The woodland setting      
 provides animal interest - red        
 squirrels, foxes, deer, and rabbits - 
 which town visitors find fascinating. </content>
