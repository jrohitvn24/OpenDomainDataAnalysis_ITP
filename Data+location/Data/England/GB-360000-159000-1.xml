		<title>01CLUTTON TODAY</title>
		<content>     Life in {CLUTTON }today is very   
 different to that in the days of {    
{William the Conqueror}.There were no  
 council houses then, no school and no 
 cars or lorries.   Life is now much   
 easier than 900 years ago. We have a  
 school, a church, a methodist church, 
 a village hall, a playing field and   
 lots more besides.We have a lot of    
 lorries coming through{CLUTTON }as    
 well as cars and some buses. There are
 several clubs in {CLUTTON}.They       
 include  The Old Nick Theatre  Group, 
 the Youth Club, the Womens' Institute 
 and the Cubs, Scouts, Guides and      
 Brownies. Last year we came second in 
 the Best Kept Village Competition and 
 all 1450 of us are trying to win it   
 this year. We have included in this   
 project interesting facts about       
{CLUTTON},everyday life, peoples' jobs 
 and the School.                       </content>
