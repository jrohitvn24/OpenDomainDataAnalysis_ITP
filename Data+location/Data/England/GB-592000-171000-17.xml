		<title>17OUR FAMILY WEEKEND 2</title>
		<content>  On Saturday, July 13th, 1985, we went
 to the garden centre and bought 14    
 small plants to go in our front       
 garden.Afterwards we bought a         
 chemistry set and bought Bianca's     
 friend a birthday present. We all went
 home and had our lunch and my dad had 
 to go to work. Mark had his friend    
 round so my mum and I went out to buy 
 some badminton rackets. When we got   
 home we had a barbecue and went       
 indoors. On Sunday we did not do much.
 We did some cleaning and cooking and  
 then we had our lunch. After lunch I  
 cleaned the car and then we went to   
 the beach to get some shells. When we 
 came back my dad had half a bottle of 
 champagne and we drank the rest.
