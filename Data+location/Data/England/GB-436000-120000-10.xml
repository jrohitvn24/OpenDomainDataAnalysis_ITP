		<title>10Hilliers Nursery</title>
		<content> On Thursday 13th. June, 1985 we went  
 to Hilliers Nursery, Botley Rd.Romsey.
 The manager Mr. Wickens explained that
 a nursery had been situated on the    
 site for 25 years, but it has only    
 belonged to Hilliers for five years.  
 Before this Mr. Wills owned it but    
 this nursery went bankrupt. The       
 nursery opens 9.00a.m.-5.30p.m. Mon.- 
 Sat. and 10.00a.m.-5.30p.m. Sun. The  
 nursery has an increasing number of   
 customers because gardening is a      
 popular hobby. The first plants sold  
 there wete chrysanthemums. Hilliers   
 has ten workers who do a variety of   
 jobs. Some fill shelves and look after
 the plants. Most of the people have   
 had special college training. The most
 popular outdoor plant is the rose. The
 most expensive plants are the         
 Stephanotis(Â£95) and the Bonsai(Â£105).
 There is a 5% loss to shoplifters.    </content>
