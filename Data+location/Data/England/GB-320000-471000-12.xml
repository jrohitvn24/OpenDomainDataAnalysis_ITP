		<title>12Centenary celebrations cont.</title>
		<content> For another part of the centenary     
 celebrations we had a centenary       
 historic fair.The historic fair used  
 to take place in Dalton a long time   
 ago and it was revived by the parish  
 church about 5 years ago.There were   
 lots of stalls which sold craftwork,  
 handmade articles,homemade sweets,    
 pottery,centenary souvenirs,crisps,   
  etc.Dalton Town Band were playing.   
 There was some clog dancing.Some      
 children from Dalton Church of        
 England School did maypole dancing.   
 Maypole dancing is dancing round a    
 pole which has ribbons attached to it 
 to make patterns.Some people were     
 dressed in old fashioned clothes of   
 100 years ago.The sun shone on the day
 and many people turned out out to     
 watch the activities and spend their  
 money on the stalls and raffles.
