		<content>{St. Michael's Church}was built in the 
 village in 1874. It was built because 
 the Old Church was too far to walk as 
 in those days there weren't any cars. 
 On average 60 people worship at the 11
 o'clock service which takes place in  
 the summer in the Old Church. The     
 village Church is used the rest of the
 year. The{Catholic Church}was built in
 1964. It's attended by approximately  
 40 people at each service.The         
{Methodist Chapel}was built in 1815    
 with the scool room added later. 20   
 people worship on average each week   
 membership is much greater many people
 being ill or too old to attend.The    
 Chapel runs the only{Sunday School}in 
 the village about 40 children attend  
 each week. There used to be another   
 Chapel at Carlidnack but that was     
 knocked down about 10 years ago and a 
 house is built on the site.           </content>
