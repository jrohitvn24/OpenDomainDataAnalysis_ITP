		<title>04RUISLIP GREAT BARN/COW BYRE</title>
		<content>  Ruislip has listed buildings around  
 the library area at the bottom of the 
 High Street.There are the Great Barn, 
 Little Barn,Manor Farm in the Manor   
 Farm leisure complex.The Great Barn   
 was built 1255 and is about 10m wide  
 and 40m long.It is made out of timber 
 from Ruislip Woods and is a local land
 mark.The Great Barn is used for       
 exhibitions,there are 2 art exhibi-   
 tions a year.It's used for Guide and  
 Scout jumble sales,also the barn and  
 the area around it are used for dog   
 training. The library ran a Saturday  
 market in the Great Barn to raise     
 funds for putting in some lighting.   
   The cow byre is no longer a listed  
 building because it has been rebuilt  
 after the original was burnt down. It 
 is used for regular exhibitions and   
 local events.
