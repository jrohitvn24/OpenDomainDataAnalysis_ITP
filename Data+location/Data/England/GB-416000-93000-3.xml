		<content>  Past the farm there was the Manor    
 Arms to our right and a few cottages  
 to the left. We then passed under the 
 Southampton to Bournemouth Railway and
 came to the Christchurch By-pass.     
 There was a small cross at the        
 junction and a footbridge. Directly   
 ahead lay Somerford and a Large       
 housing estate. We skirted the estate 
 to the right and arrived at Purewell  
 Cross. Turning left  into Somerford   
 Road there was a small industrial was 
 estate to our right. On our left was  
 Somerford Ambulance Station and the   
 Grange Comprehensive School. At the   
 top of the road we passed two new     
 superstores (A DIY store and a        
 furniture and carpet store). We could 
 also see the terminus for the no.20   
 yellow bus.                           
  Eventually we came to a large        
 roundabout at the start of the bypass.</content>
