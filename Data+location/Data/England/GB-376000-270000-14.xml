		<title>14CROSS COUNTRY,ARELEY ST'PORT</title>
		<content> In the winter I go training, doing    
 cross country running in Areley Wood. 
 It is great fun running around and    
 getting muddy, especially when it has 
 been raining the day before .We have  
 to run around the wood about 6 or 7   
 times.It is very difficult at first   
 but after a while you get used to     
 it.We don't do cross country running  
 in the summer,we do training in       
 Lickhill Park.I enjoy doing running in
 Areley Wood best.In the summer I look 
 forward to doing it in the winter.    
    The wood is quite small if you     
 compare with other woods in this      
 area.There are alot of hills and at   
 each end of the wood there is a       
 stream,sometimes it is quite deep.It  
 is usually sloshy and muddy and very  
 slippery.Sometimes you can hurt       
 yourself when you fall over.
