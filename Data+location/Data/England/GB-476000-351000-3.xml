		<content>    I think that Newark needs a bit    
 more entertainment for youth. The     
 sport centre has good facilities but  
 not everybody is interested in sport. 
 It would be useful to have a centre   
 where young people could get together 
 to share hobbies such as chess or     
 music and crafts. Also for the young  
 teenagers or under a weekly amusement 
 arcade or a park would be better. For 
 the shopping business there should be 
 a few more appliance shops or computer
 shops. I think that a few more        
 theatres would be appreciated, though 
 cinemas are going quite well. There   
 should be more services and clubs for 
 the elderly, or disabled because they 
 would be more happier. Another        
 important thing is road safety, a few 
 more zebra crossings or traffic lights
 because the rate of accidents is quite
 high.                                 </content>
