  In the Bagnall area the village is   
old styled cottages built of stone with
old farm building surrounding the area.
  Most of these cottages have little   
gas but mainly coal and electricity.   
  Recently the area has been an        
attraction to businessmen and there    
have appeared large expensive houses   
usually with large grounds to them     
dotted around the area.This has meant  
an increase in the commuting traffic.  
  On the other side of the area near to
Werrington a new housing estate is     
being built consisting of semi and     
detached houses in the new style.This  
has attracted a much younger type of   
couple with small families.
