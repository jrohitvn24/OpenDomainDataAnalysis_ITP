 THURSTABLE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL       
 The land for the school was purchased 
 before 1939 but it was not built until
 1957.It was called a Secondary Modern 
 School and served a wide area.In 1966 
 Essex Education Authority approved    
 plans to turn the school into a       
 Comprehensive, although this was not  
 done until 1975.                      
 The school has been added to over the 
 years and now boasts such facilities  
 as music and drama studios,large      
 sports' halls, science and technical  
 blocks and multi_purpose halls.At the 
 present time it caters for about 1,000
 children.                             
   Its name is derived from an old     
 Essex County division called          
 "Hundreds",Thurstable being the local 
 one.
