		<title>19WILDLIFE IN THE WOODLANDS</title>
		<content>  In the woodland the worst enemies to 
 the trees are{rabbits}because they eat
 the baby trees.The foresters {trap }  
 rabbits or {shoot}them to keep the    
 population down.                      
  Another pest is the{red deer}because 
 it rubs its velvet off and in doing   
 that it damages the bark and inside of
 the trees.The hunters only kill 4 or 5
{deer}a year out of a herd of about 50.
 There are also a few{roe deer}.       
   The{woodpecker}does good to the     
 trees because it eats the beetles     
 inside the trees.{Grey squirrels} live
 in the trees.Their nests are called { 
{dreys}.They eat the cones and the tops
 of trees.                             
    There are also {badgers}in the     
 woods which make large holes in the   
 ground called {setts}.Sometimes there 
 are rare birds like the{hobby}.       
                                       </content>
