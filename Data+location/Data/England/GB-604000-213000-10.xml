		<title>10BEACH LITTER IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>    A litter survey was carried out on 
 East Mersea beach.The following items 
 were found:                           
   2 empty beer bottles, several       
 pieces of burnt wood,1 fruit juice    
 carton,a broken chair,a glass         
 bottle,corks,some rope,a few pieces   
 of polystyrene,2 beach sandals of     
 different size,a sweet packet,a       
 training shoe,a cup,some barbed       
 wire,many plastic carrier bags,4      
 cans,crisp packets and a beach mat.   
   The sites of several fires          
 were evident and there was a lot      
 of driftwood on the beach. There were 
 a number of dead trees used by        
 wildlife and the exposed roots of     
 others on the cliff-face suggested    
 that these may have resulted from sea 
 erosion of the cliff.
