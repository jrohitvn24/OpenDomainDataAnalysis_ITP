  Hundon still has a considerable      
numer of ancient buildings many still  
having thatch roofs though the cost of 
replacing the thatch is causing many   
owners to replace with old tile in some
cases peg and others pantiles.         
 Probably the oldest house in the      
village is "Thatchers Hall" formerly   
known as "The Thatchers". This  is a   
fine fifteen century "Wealdon" type    
house. It is timber framed and         
plastered with the end bays jettied on 
the first storey and the roof carried  
over in line with the front of the     
jettied bays, supported on brackets.   
The original thatch has now been       
replaced by old peg tiles. The hall had
an upper storey inserted during the    
sixtth century. The original cambered  
tie beam and a good crown post.
