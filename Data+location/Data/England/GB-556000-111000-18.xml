		<title>18If I had to hide.</title>
		<content> (Based on the idea of being on the run
 in the local area).If I could I'd go  
 to{WOODS CORNER.}I would go there     
 because it would bring back happy     
 memories of when I went there for     
 picnics. I would also go there because
 it is almost invisible, hidden by     
 thick green shrubs and tall dark      
 ferns. I would hide in the old tower  
 made of grey cold stone. The tower was
 built by {Mad Jack Fuller}in the 18th 
 century. I would go right to the top  
 part of the tower where I could see   
 everything. I could even see over the 
 top of the tall, thick fens. All      
 around the tower are fields, all      
 different shades of green and brown.  
 It looked just like a patchwork quilt 
 joined together by hedges and fences. 
 I would watch the trees swaying to and
 fro in the wind and daydream.
