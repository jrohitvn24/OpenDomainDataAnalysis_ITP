		<content> Some people who live outside our      
 rectangle come into it to work.The    
 majority of those employed in the     
 rectangle however also live there.The 
 largest influence in our rectangle is 
 the golf course.Some people who play  
 golf come from as far as London and   
 some people come from as near as      
 Launceston itself.Members of the club 
 who live more than twenty five miles  
 away qualify as Country Members and   
 pay a lower subscription.The villages 
 of Langore and Tregadillett have a    
 number of residents who have moved    
 there on retirement.In Tregadillett   
 the proportion of retired persons from
 London and The Midlands is            
 approximately 40%.During the holiday  
 season thousands of people pass       
 through a small portion of our        
 rectangle.This is along the A30 road  
 between Tregadillett and Launceston.  </content>
