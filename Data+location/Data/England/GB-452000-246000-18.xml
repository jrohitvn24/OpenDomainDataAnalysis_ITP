		<title>18CULWORTH FAMILY LIFE 1</title>
		<content>There is very little organised activity
for mothers,tiny children and babies in
Culworth village.There is little need  
as families and members of the         
community support each other.Quite a   
few young mothers have relatives to    
call on for advice a short distance    
away.When the need has arisen groups of
friends have joined together to form   
self  help toddler groups.Baby sitting 
is undertaken by relatives,older       
members of the community and older     
teenagers.There is a playgroup run by  
mothers in the next village Eydon.There
is a Northamptonshire County Council   
Nursery Unit at Woodford Halse School a
few miles away.There is no longer a    
doctors surgery in Culworth but        
families registered with practices in  
Byfield,Banbury and Brackley enjoy the 
usual services.Access to private       
transport is important to get around.  </content>
