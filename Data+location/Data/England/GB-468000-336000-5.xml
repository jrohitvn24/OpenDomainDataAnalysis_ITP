		<title>05FARMING: TITHBY</title>
		<content> Most land here is farmed on the arable
 system, growing wheat, barley, rape,  
 sugar beet &amp; potatoes. Most cottages  
 are occupied by the farm workers; all 
 have been modernised and are usually  
 rent/rate free. Most farms employ 3 or
 4 men. There is a dairy farm at Tithby
 with a 200 cow milking herd and 1 or 2
 others have some sheep &amp; store cattle.
 Nearly all the land attached to the   
 dairy farm is grass &amp; lucerne which is
 grazed by cows and young stock, &amp; made
 into silage for winter feed. The cows 
 are Fresians, cost about Â£800 each &amp;  
 give 6,000 kg of milk per lactation.  
 All the milk is sold through the Milk 
 Marketing Board at 17 p/litre and is  
 collected daily by tanker. Previously 
 cheese was made at this farm but      
 demand outgrew the premises and Tithby
 Dairy is now based at Bottesford.
