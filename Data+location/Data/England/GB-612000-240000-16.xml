		<content>This is an interview with the manager- 
ess of the hotel.                      
On week days we get business people,   
and week-ends we get people for short  
holidays. We get people from all walks 
of life.                               
We've got 32 bedrooms in the hotel and 
the majority of bedrooms are full every
night.                                 
We have lots of famous people staying -
I can't tell you how many: Dr Hook,    
Imagination, Barbara Dixon, Cannon &amp;   
Ball, Hot Chocolate, Boy George. We    
also have lots of football teams, for  
example, Liverpool, Chelsea and South- 
ampton.                                
We have an a la carte menu which       
changes once every three months.       
Turnover is roughly 13 to 14 thousand  
pounds a week; it is sometimes more,   
sometimes less. So our turnover is     
about 700,000 pounds a year. Cont P17. </content>
