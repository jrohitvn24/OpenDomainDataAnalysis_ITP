		<title>11FARMING IN DALWOOD.</title>
		<content> A hundred years ago there were 37     
 farms in Dalwood. Now there are only  
 sixteen.Some with thatch were burned  
 down and some have become houses.Farm 
 land has been joined to neighbouring  
 farms and many hedges and trees have  
 disappeared.Nowadays farms average    
 100-150 acres instead of 50 acres as  
 in the past.Farms used to make        
 cider.Now most are dairy farms with   
 friesian cattle, some milkers and some
 for beef.Up until ten years ago milk  
 was collected in churns but now it is 
 pumped in to tankers.Once it took 4   
 men a day to make hay.Now one man with
 a silager can turn a field in an      
 hour.There are two poultry            
 farms.Sheep, pigs, goats and geese are
 also kept locally. On Thursdays       
 farmers can sell their animals at     
 Axminster Market.
