		<content> Although this block lies in a district
 of{intensively farmed grassland}with  
 high fertiliser usage, it is also     
 ecologically fairly rich. The major   
 feature is the{River Weaver.}Also of  
 importance are the{canal}and various  
 woods,copses and hedgerows.The Weaver 
 has recently been upgraded to a class 
 2 quality river,with reduction in the 
 the ammonia{pollution}from the sewage 
 works upstream. This means that it is 
 capable of supporting{coarse fish.}   
 Below the weir gudgeon,stone loach,   
 dace, chubb and roach are found. The  
 physical barrier of the weir has      
 delayed colonisation higher up the    
 river.The banks support a varied{flora
 and fauna. In one riverside meadow a  
 survey during May indicated 76 species
 of grasses and meadow flowers,        
 including rarities such as  a few     
 clumps of{cowslips}and{primroses.     </content>
