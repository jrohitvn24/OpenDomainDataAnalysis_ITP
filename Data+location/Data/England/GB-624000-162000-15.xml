		<content> The oldest houses at Stourmouth pre-  
 date the Tudor's. They are built of   
{Caen stone}and flints, and the walls  
 of the lower stories have a{'chequer  
{board'}appearance. Timber framed      
 buildings are common although some    
 have had an outer skin of red brick   
 added, and so look much more modern   
 than they are. There are also example 
 of Post-Tudor buildings in red brick  
 with{'Flemish Gables".}Perhaps the    
 finest buildings in the district are  
 Georgian, with one superb farmhouse.  
 Victorian and later houses and farm   
 buildings are dotted about, so that   
 during a walk through Stourmouth you  
 can see every stage in vernacular     
 architecture, from the{14th Century}to
 the present day.
