		<content> There are two cloakrooms with sinks   
 and coat pegs.                        
  Many children walk to school, but    
 some cycle and some go by car.        
  The building is made mostly of brick 
 and flint, the roof is made with      
 tiles.                                
  The school is placed on the outskirts
 of Whissonsett, along a little road   
 called Wash Lane.                     
  The playground has an apparatus which
 the children usually play on, only    
 with an adult looking after them.
