		<title>09GAITSGILL FARM</title>
		<content>   Gaitsgill Farm is a tenanted farm   
 which is rented from the church       
 commissioners. It has a total acreage 
 of 126 acres.                         
   At the moment it is a beef farm,    
 with Hereford bullocks and Hereford   
 Cross cows with Charolais calves at   
 foot. In July 1985 the farmer might go
 back to milking cows again. If so,    
 there will be between 50 and 60       
 Ayrshire cows along with about 6 or 7 
 Jersey cows.                          
   The farmer does not employ any      
 labour; he only gets help from his    
 family at nights and weekends. When it
 comes to silaging, ploughing,         
 hedge-cutting or combining the farmer 
 gets help from an agricultural        
 contractor because he can do the job  
 more easily than the farmer can and   
 he has the the right machinery to do  
 the job.                              </content>
