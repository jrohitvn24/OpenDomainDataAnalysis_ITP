		<title>19A DAIRY FARMER</title>
		<content> John Richards is a dairy farmer. He   
 milks twice a day and owns many cows. 
 He starts work at about 7.45am and    
 ends at 10.00pm in the summer. His    
 favourite job is moving the electric  
 fence, while one of his helpers really
 enjoys driving. John hates fetching   
 the cows in bad weather but generally 
 finds farming an enjoyable  job       
 although he finds the milk quota      
 system unfair for people with forty   
 cows. The hardest job is haymaking in 
 the hot summer.John believes that it  
 is harder to start a farm these days  
 and that you need more knowledge than 
 before.
