		<title>17EMPLOYMENT IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Employment in the village is found in 
 agriculture, racing stables, shop, a  
 guest house, welding, furniture       
 restoration and freelance floristry,  
 the last three being self-employment  
 only. Employment in the shop is       
 part-time and one or two ladies are   
 employed part-time as domestics in the
 village. The workforce in the area is 
 very small, numbering only forty. Of  
 these only twelve are employed in the 
 village and the rest go to London,    
 Salisbury, Bristol, Warminster or very
 locally to Dan Maid Seafoods Ltd. One 
 or two are in Her Majesty's Services  
 at nearby R.A.F. or Army bases and one
 villager is in the Royal Navy. The    
 choice of livelihood is varied; as    
 well as the Armed Forces, the law,    
 entertainment, building, engineering  
 and office work provide employment    
 outside the area.                     </content>
