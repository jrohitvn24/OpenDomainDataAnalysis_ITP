 Crops are grown intensively as we have
 some of the best land in the country. 
 Farmers are now getting very keen on  
 planting trees and hedges again, and  
 some big projects are planned for our 
 area. As a result, we now have a lot  
 of pheasants, partridges, hares and   
 even foxes.                           
 We already have a great variety of sea
 birds, some of which are winter or    
 summer visitors like the sedge warbler
 and the ringed plover.                
  Our wild flowers are mainly confined 
 to the roadsides, but many tulip      
 fields have poppies and tall daisies  
 growing amongst them in the summer.
