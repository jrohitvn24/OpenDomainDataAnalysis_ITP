		<content> The village of Gittisham is just off  
 the old Fosse way to the West of      
 Honiton. Most of the houses are       
 thatched and were originally occupied 
 by workers on the Marker Estate. About
 30 years ago the council built 4      
 houses and later 4 bungalows for old  
 age pensioners. Three of the four     
 houses are now privately owned. There 
 has been only one house built since   
 then, it was built by 'Devon Lady' a  
 local firm. At the moment a farm-yard 
 is being converted into 4 houses, 2   
 flats and some workshops.             
 Every year we organise a Guy Fawkes   
 night, the mums make the food, the    
 dads organise the fireworks, the      
 children collect rubbish for the fire 
 and make the Guy.                     
 Every Tuesday a shopping bus takes    
 people to Honiton. This is the only   
 public transport we have.             </content>
