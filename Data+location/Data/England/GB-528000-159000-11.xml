		<title>11Things to do in Coulsdon</title>
		<content>   When I get home from school I do my 
 homework and have my tea. That takes  
 me until 6.30pm.                      
   In the evening I go out with my     
 friends. There is a group of us, about
 15, we go around together. We go to   
 parties and discos, which is really   
 good fun. On some evenings we go round
 to someones house and have a          
 discussion or a general muck around.  
   On a Saturday I go to a Youth Club. 
 We play snooker, table tennis and     
 silly games. On odd days we have video
 evenings. We get out a couple of      
 videos, usually a sad and a funny one.
 People come round and watch them and  
 stay the night.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
