		<title>14ST. MARY'S CHURCH BUNNY</title>
		<content> Bunny church is called{St.Mary the    
{Virgin}or the cathedral of the Wolds  
 because it is the biggest church in   
 the area. The vicar is the Reverend C.
 Jones who comes to our school every   
 Wednesday. He holds a service at 0900 
 on Sunday in Bradmore Chapel and in   
 Bunny Church at 1830 hrs. On the great
 festivals of Christmas, Easter and    
 Ascension special services are held.  
 One unusual service is the{Christingle
 for children held after Christmas and 
 the money collected is sent to the    
 N.S.P.C.C. There has been a church in 
 Bunny since 1228. The church has six  
 bells, it is unusual because it has   
 two fonts but only the north one is   
 used for baptisms. The church is very 
 popular for weddings, when it is gaily
 decorated with flowers. Many villagers
 are buried in the churchyard and there
 is a memorial to Sir Thomas Parkyns.  </content>
