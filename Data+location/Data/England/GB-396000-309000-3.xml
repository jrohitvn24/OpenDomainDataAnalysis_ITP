   As Cannock stands on gravelly soil  
 it was in the old days very short of  
 water in summer. The facetious or     
proud boast,according to taste,was that
Cannock contained more beer than water!
 Hence a hexagonal conduit pump was    
built in the town centre in 1736 to    
bring water supply to Cannock by public
subscription.                          
 The conduit pump was built by the     
Conduit Trust and continued to supply  
water to Cannock until 1942 when       
subsidence finally put paid to the     
tubing.                                
 The Trust became a registered charity 
in 1962 and money has been put to      
other uses such as flood-lighting on   
the south side of St Luke's church.
