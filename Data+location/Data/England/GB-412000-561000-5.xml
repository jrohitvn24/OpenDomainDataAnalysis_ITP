 By the 1950's the population had      
 dropped to less than 4000. This was   
 largely due to the gradual running    
 down of the coal mines in the         
 district. However, new housing        
 development, which began in the       
 1970's, and continues in the 1980's   
 has resulted in a large increase in   
 the number of families moving into the
 area.
