 who owns Kingford Farm,keeps some     
 dairy cows,beef cattle,sheep and grows
 some crops.He employs one worker and  
 his son also helps.He keeps the dairy

 easily brought in for milking.He keeps
 the sheep and beef cattle further away
 from the farm.He goes to check his    
 livestock every day.Mr. Blowey has 42 
 dairy cows which are Friesians.He     
 sells the milk to the Ambrosia factory

 rice pudding and other milk           
 products.He gets 1100 gallons of milk 
 per cow,per year.The cows are milked  
 at 7 a.m.and 5 p.m.In winter he keeps 
 the cows in stalls.They are fed kale  
 and concentrates whilst being milked
