 fifteen people from{Shepshed}who were 
 elected by local people. It gets money
 for its work from{rates.}On average   
 each household pays 25 pence per week.
 This money should be spent on what the
 townspeople want.                     
    All parish councils are responsible
 for{parks, cemeteries, allotments,    
{litter bins, bus stops and public     
{seats.}The Shepshed parish council has
 been in existence for{three years,}and
 in that time they have tried to make  
 life in Shepshed more pleasant. They  
 are very proud of the{B.M.X. track    
 that they helped to build. They also  
 employ a{full-time road sweeper}to    
 keep the town clean. They organise a  
{community centre}to help local people,
 and their future plans include making 
 the park a safer place for children to
 play.                                 </content>
