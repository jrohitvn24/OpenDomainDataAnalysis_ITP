		<title>20LIFE IN WINGATE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> A Resident of Wingate Village was     
 asked how life had changed in the 68  
 years that he had lived there. The    
 village has expanded and yet houses   
 have been knocked down. The biggest   
 change came when the colliery closed  
 in 1976 because, of course, many men  
 lost their jobs.                      
 Transport has changed considerably. 60
 years ago the push bike and horse and 
 trap were common place. Char-a-bancs  
 began to appear at this time too.     
 People did not travel far then- the   
 main event of the year was a trip to  
 Newcastle.                            
 The houses 60 years ago had no        
 electricity or running water. The     
 toilets were outside earth toilets,   
 they had no flushing mechanism.       
 The event that remains a vivid memory 
 in this resident's mind was the Second
 World War,and the school being bombed.</content>
