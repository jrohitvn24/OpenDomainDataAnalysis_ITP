		<title>17BURWASH CHURCHYARD</title>
		<content>    Our churchyard has a winding path  
 that wends its way through the graves.
 Many gravestones are very old, some   
 are made from marble that glints in   
 the sunlight, there are other areas   
 for family plots where several        
 generations of the one family are     
 buried. It is a very quiet place      
 between the High Street and the       
 School, there is a very old Yew tree, 
 two seats in the lee of the church and
 many walks start from the edge of the 
 churchyard. There is one grave that is
 said to have a secret passageway that 
 leads to Bateman's, many of the graves
 have pretty flowers arranged on them, 
 while others have skull and crossbones
 inscribed on them, these depict the   
 graves of former smugglers. There are 
 two memorial stones that commemorate  
 the courageous soldiers that died in  
 the First and Second World Wars.      </content>
