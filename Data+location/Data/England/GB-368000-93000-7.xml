		<title>07E. CHARMINSTER - WILDLIFE 1</title>
		<content>  Such rural surroundings as are found 
 in this area support an abundance of  
 wildlife. Since there are no roads,   
 and hence no traffic noise to disturb 
 the peace, the observant walker is    
 usually well rewarded.                
  Rabbits and hares are probably the   
 most common animals and therefore most
 frequently seen; foxes, too, slinking 
 from one field to another, apparently 
 quite unconcerned at the daylight.    
  There is evidence of badger activity 
 in several places, although it has to 
 be a night-time vigil if you want to  
 watch them unobserved.                
  Large herds of deer move across the  
 area from Puddletown Woods, using the 
 copses as daylight cover and often    
 grazing along the edges of the fields.
  One farmer hires two hunters from    
 Belgium to cull the deer as and when  
 necessary.                            </content>
