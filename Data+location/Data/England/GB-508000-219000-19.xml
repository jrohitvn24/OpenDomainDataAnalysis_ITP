		<content>{Hillborough Junior School }was opened 
 ten years ago to relieve overcrowding 
 in other schools.Now Hillborough,like 
 its neighbours,has empty places       
 because of a fall in the birth rate.  
 Here are the views of some pupils aged
 9 and 10.                             
                                       
{Kathryn }liked the teachers unless she
 was told off!                         
{Caroline }enjoyed P.E.and writing.    
{Andrew }liked computer work,maths and 
 playtime.                             
{Rory }didn't like school very much,   
 especially having to get up early in  
 the mornings.                         
{Emma }looked forward to meeting her   
 friends for a good natter.            
{Barry's }dislikes were English and    
 doing historical things.
