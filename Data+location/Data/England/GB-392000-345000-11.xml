		<title>11Victorian Day</title>
		<content>Werrington Infants School were having a
Victorian Day,all the pupils and staff 
were dressed in Victorian style clothes
.The boys wore knee-length trousers,   
boots,braces and  caps.The girls wore  
longish dresses and aprons,and the     
teachers wore anklelength skirts and   
blouses.                               
  The children were taught as Victorian
children would be.The teachers were a  
lot stricter with them.They had to sit 
rows instead of a group and the boys   
couldn't sit with the girls,also the   
children couldn't talk.                
  Generally the classes have a class   
reading book but instead they had to   
read charts that were on the wall.The  
P.E. lessons were called Drill.These   
were different as well.Usually they    
played games but they had to do        
stretching exercises.The boys and girls
liked dressing up like Victorians.     </content>
