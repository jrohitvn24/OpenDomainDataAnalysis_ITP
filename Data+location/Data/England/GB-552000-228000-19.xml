		<title>19Shopping around Henham</title>
		<content> The shops people would most like in   
 Henham were Butcher Greengrocer Baker 
 D.I.Y bank.For food most people shop  
 in Bishop Stortford.Other popular     
 towns for food shopping were Harlow   
 Stansted Hertford and Henham.Bishop   
 Stortford is also most popular for    
 clothes shopping.Chelmsford,          
 Cambridge,Harlow and London were also 
 used.Henham Stores was mainly used for
 day to day shopping.Most people       
 shopping daily which surprised us.Next
 was weekly.Most people bought both    
 Fresh and Frozen food.No-one bought   
 only Frozen food,a few bought just    
 Fresh food .We were surprised that    
 most people enjoyed shopping but not  
 surprised that most found food too    
 expensive.Class 1 at our school did   
 not like shopping.
