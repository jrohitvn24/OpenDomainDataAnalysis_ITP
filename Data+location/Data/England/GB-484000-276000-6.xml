We interviewed a 108 people in the     
Newborough Centre on Friday May 10th   
1985.64 people were Kettering shoppers 
and the rest came from around the area.
Sainsbury's is the most popular        
shop.88% were in favour of covered in  
shopping   centres because it is warm  
and dry.64%  of the people were        
against Sunday trading and 36% wanted  
the shops to open on a Sunday.52% of   
the people      interviewed thought    
that the old buildings should have     
been knocked down.Some people thought  
that the old buildings should have     
been knocked down because they were in 
very bad state of  repair.Some people  
thought they shouldnt have been        
knocked down because they could have   
been redecorated or they could have    
left the old building front and built  
behind it.                             </content>
