		<content> SOME OF OUR CLASS VISITED THE CHURCH  
 IN THE VILLAGE.IT IS CALLED ALL       
 SAINTS.THE RECTOR IS LORD MILVERTON.I 
 LIKED THE KNEELERS BECAUSE THEY HAD   
 SOME INTERESTING PATTERNS ON THEM ONE 
 OF THEM HAD A PICTURE OF TWO YELLOW   
 KEYS CROSSED OVER.WE DREW SOME        
 PICTURES OF THE WARDENS POLES AND WE  
 HAD TO LOOK CAREFULLY ALL ROUNDTHE    
 CHURCH.WE FOUND SOME STRANGE MARKS ON 
 THE WALL, ONE LOOKED LIKE A SUN-THEY  
 WERE PUT THERE BY THE MASONS WHO BUILT
 THE CHURCH.ALL THE PEWS ARE MADE OF   
 WOOD AND I GUESSED 8 PEOPLE COULD SIT 
 ON EACH ONE.WE LOOKED IN THE BELL     
 TOWER ROOM BUT NO ONE RINGS THE BELLS 
 NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SAFE          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
