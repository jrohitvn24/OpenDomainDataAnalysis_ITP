		<title>16HOUSING MODERNISATION</title>
		<content> Over the last ten years, all the      
 council houses around our school have 
 been modernised. An exhibition was    
 held in our school to show the people 
 what would happen. The houses now have
 central heating, lots of electric     
 plugs, new bathrooms, and new         
 kitchens. All the people we asked     
 liked their new houses, now that they 
 have moved back, in spite of a few    
 problems.
