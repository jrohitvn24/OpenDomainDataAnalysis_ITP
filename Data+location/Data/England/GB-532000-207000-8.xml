 Cycle Rally at The Huntsman Public    
 House at Goose Green on Sunday 15th   
 Sept.85. The vehicles,parked in the   
 Beer Garden by the duckpond,were much 
 admired. All pre-1930 &amp; all lovingly  
 restored &amp; maintained by their owners:
 Bentleys,a Humber,Lagonda,Morris      
 Cowleys &amp; motor cycles too. Hamburgers
 &amp; sausages were sold at the outdoor   
 barbeque,raffle tickets too. All this 
 to raise funds for the Guide Dogs for 
 the Blind, the publican's pet charity.

 this traditional country pub in its   
 beautiful woodland setting, customers 
 have enthusiastically supported many  
 fund raising events for this Charity.

 Huntsman are on display in the oak-   
 beamed bar. After this Rally it is    
 hoped there will soon be a third!     </content>
