		<title>11Living in Stanwell</title>
		<content> Old Stanwell was not like it is now,  
 because the roads used to be only     
 tracks, but they are covered with     
 tarmac now.                           
 I like Stanwell because there are lots
 of grass and trees. I like the people 
 because they are friendly.            
 I do not like the noise of the        
 aeroplanes because they wake me up    
 when I am in bed. The airport does    
 make lots of jobs though.

 I like Stanwell because the people are
 nice. I don't like the people who     
 throw rubbish in the well, because    
 Preetpal and I had to clean it up.
