		<title>18STOBHILL-HOUSES</title>
		<content> At Stobhill there are now a lot of    
{council }houses.They were built for   
 slum clearance{.Private estates}were  
 built later.The area used to be       
{farmland }and{market gardens.}There   
 was a {rubbish tip}too.Most of the    
 older people were born in Morpeth and 
 moved into Stobhill.The{prefab houses}
 ,which are now smart {modernised      
{bungalows,}were built after the war   
 for quick housing reasons.The fare to 
 Morpeth was once only one old         
 penny,now it is 20p.The children used 
 to go to school in Morpeth,until      
 Stobhillgate school was built.The     
 houses in Stobhill estate are all     
 named after the numbers from one to   
 eleven.
