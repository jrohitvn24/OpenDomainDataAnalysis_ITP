		<title>10  **    Hop Growing   **</title>
		<content>    Throughout the growing season,     
 workers are constantly{spraying}the   
 hops to prevent diseases, moulds and  
 weeds.{                               
{   Hop_picking}lasts nearly all of    
 September and many extra workers are  
 needed on the farm, especially in the 
 hop gardens, pulling down the hop{    
{bines,}which are taken by tractor and 
 trailer to the hop picking machine.   
 There the hops are stripped off the   
 bines, separated from the leaves and  
 pass on a conveyor belt to the{oast   
{house,}where they are dried. The dried
 hops are then packed tightly into     
 seven foot sacks, which are called{   
{pockets.}The hop pockets are taken to 
 a warehouse and are later distributed 
 to brewers to be used for making{beer.
    Some of the oast houses around {   
{Lamberhurst}have been carefully       
 converted into desirable residences.  </content>
