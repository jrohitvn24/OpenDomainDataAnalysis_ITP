		<content> weather like they have always had to. 
 Better seeds and improved fertilizers 
 have helped farmers grow a lot more   
 food. Mr. Farnsworth said that "in    
 his lifetime yields had improved      
 300%". We thought that this was       
 good, but Mr. Farnsworth said that too
 much food production in the Common    
 Market is causing problems.           
   We thought that farmers worked hard 
 and Mr. Farnsworth agreed with us. He 
 said that he worked about ten hours a 
 day, depending on the weather and     
 what had to be done. His work is very 
 varied. Sometimes a farmer has to be  
 a veterinary surgeon, scientist,      
 manager or mechanic. Good machinery   
 means that nowadays he can plough     
 sixteen acres a day but years ago when
 he used horses, he could only plough  
 one acre in a whole day. Ploughing is 
 Mr. Farnsworth's most enjoyable job.  </content>
