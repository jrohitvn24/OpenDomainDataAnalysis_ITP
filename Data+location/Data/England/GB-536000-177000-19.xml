Education in our area comprises of     
nursery (3-5 years), primary (5-11     
years) and secondary school (11-16).   
Playgroups run by a variety of         
different sources (council, private)   
also exist for the under 5,s our       
school , Grinling Gibbons , runs a     
weekly mother - toddler group for      
under 3,s. Most of the school are      
controlled by the inner london         
education authority though there are   
one or two fee paying, independent     
schools in the greenwich area.
