		<content> Darlingtons, a major producer of      
 mushrooms in the UK, with an output   
 of Â£12 million per year.  Production  
 is 60,000 lbs a week. First, trays are
 filled with compost. Next they're     
 taken to the peak heat rooms. They    
 stay there for 7 days for             
 pasteurisation. Then the compost is   
 through-spawned by machines           
 on rye grains and pressed with ram    
 pressure. Next, trays are taken to    
 spawn running rooms for 10-12 days.   
 A casing of peat and chalk is put on. 
 The trays are taken to the cropping   
 house and watered and the temperature 
 and humidity can be controlled at     
 20-24c  90% humidity for about 10-12  
 days. Then lowered to 18c 80% humidity
 as mushrooms form. Trays come into    
 crop 21 days from casing. These are   
 "Blue Prince" mushrooms sold to       
 supermarkets.                         </content>
