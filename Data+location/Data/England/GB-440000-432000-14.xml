		<title>14HISTORY OF GARFORTH</title>
		<content> Although Garforth is mentioned as     
 having a church and a priest in the   
 Domesday Book, the settlement is best 
 known as a mining village from about  
 two hundred years ago. As you walk    
 round Garforth you can see tips or    
 spoil heaps where rubbish from down   
 the mines has been dumped. Coal used  
 to be carried from Garforth to        
 Aberford, about two miles away, by    
 railway. The line was called the Fly  
 Line. It has been closed for about    
 fifty years, but you can still walk   
 down the old track. The mines were    
 owned by the Gascoigne family and were
 named after them, for example, the    
 Isabella Pit. The Gascoignes used to  
 live in a large mansion in Parlington 
 Park on the edge of Garforth. The     
 house has been demolished, but there  
 is still a footpath you can use to    
 walk through the park.                </content>
