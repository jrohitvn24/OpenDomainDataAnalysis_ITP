		<content> People live in{small isolated clusters
 and generally prefer this. A car is   
 necessary as there are few amenities. 
 Most liked indoor hobbies - reading   
 and handicrafts. Nearly every adult   
 liked gardening but sports facilities 
 are several miles distant. People take
 regular shopping trips to a large town
 and go to nearer shops for occasional 
 purchases. Most families prefer{'good,
{plain' food;}home grown veg.as part of
 the diet.{Pets}are kept: cats(the most
 popular), dogs, goldfish and chickens.
 One person kept pigeons, another      
 ferrets. Only four families would     
 admit to being{superstitious.}They    
 felt that a death would follow        
 bringing hawthorn indoors. Black-     
 berries must not be eaten in October  
 when the Devil flies over them. Some  
 say the Baskerville Hounds haunt the  
 area. No ghosts were reported.        </content>
