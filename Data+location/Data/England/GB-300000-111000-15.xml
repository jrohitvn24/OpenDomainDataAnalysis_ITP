		<title>15HALBERTON MILL</title>
		<content>  We went to{Halberton Mill,}and met   
 the manager.18 years ago it was set up
 by 3 families,but today it is owned by
 Sheldon Jones PLC.They make cattle and
 poultry feeds and get grain and corn  
 from local farmers and factories.They 
 sell their products abroad and in     
 desert areas,and to local farmers.    
 There are 3 lorry drivers,6 mill      
 workers, 2 secretaries and a manager. 
   Lorries bring in raw material and   
 are weighed.Materials are put into a  
 grate and then a tank.The contents and
 the size of the pellets vary according
 to the size and the kind of animals.  
 Then it is bagged and labelled.       
   We thought the mill was smelly,     
 dusty,dirty,noisy but not so that you 
 had to put ear muffs on,and every so  
 often,there would be a shower of      
 pellets.The mill isn't very modern but
 can produce 500 bags an hour.         </content>
