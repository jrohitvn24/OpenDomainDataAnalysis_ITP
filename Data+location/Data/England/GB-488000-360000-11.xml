		<content>   {Social Concerns }Special Housing   
 --------------------------------------
             During a County Council   
 housing development in the area, some 
 eight years ago, special arrangements 
 were made for the rehousing of a      
 family with a{handicapped}teenager.   
             A special bungalow was    
 built.This enabled the teenage boy to 
 be as{independent}as possible.Toilets 
 and sinks were adapted for easy access
 and use from a{wheelchair}. When the  
 family had lived in a house this was  
 impossible.The boy had to be lifted   
 up and down stairs by his parents.    
             The boy also has a special
 motorised car. This was given to him  
 following a special fund raising      
 event.
