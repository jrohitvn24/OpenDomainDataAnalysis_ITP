 between 7 and 7.30am and get dressed  
 into school uniform, then they go and 
 have their breakfast,which usually    
 consists of cereal and toast.After    
 breakfast they wash their faces and   
 brush their teeth.Then they either    
 walk or go by car to school.While they
 are waiting for lessons to start they 
 wait in the playground.When they are  
 inside they go into assembly.The      
 school day is divided into four       
 periods,each followed by a short      
 break.After school some people go to  
 clubs and after tea they usually spend
 most of the evening watching T.V.

 later .Some people watch television   
 for a small part of the day.On{Sundays
