		<content> The traditional arts and crafts       
 practised at Church Farm are those    
 handed down from generation to        
 generation. Certainly the weavers we  
 interviewed have had more than the    
 average six months to learn their     
 hobby-cum-job. The man we interviewed 
 started to learn to weave when he was 
 about seven, although he confesses    
 that he is more of a potter than a    
 weaver. The business as well as being 
 used by tourists has also been        
 commissioned by the Society of Friends
 to make a backcloth similar to the    
 Bayeux Tapestry depicting the history 
 of the Quaker Movement.               
 The cloth is all hand-made from the   
 spinning of the fleece to the weaving 
 of the cloth. All dyes used are       
 natural and many are grown by them.   
 Cloth costs from nine to twelve pounds
 per square yard.                      </content>
