		<title>18RECREATION IN LEADENHAM</title>
		<content> Although Leadenham is only a small    
 village,there is a well maintained    
 playing field where a number of sports
 are played.There are at present about 
 twenty members of the cricket club who
 practise regularly and play an average
 of once a week. They play in the      
 Lincoln &amp; District League.The Club was
 formed about twelve years ago.The     
 Bowls Club has eighteen to twenty     
 members and also has a green at the   
 playing fields.The members play in the
 Cliff League against neighbouring     
 villages.The Tennis Club is run on a  
 voluntary basis. The 40 members and   
 the local school each have a key. They
 let themselves in to the court and    
 lock up afterwards.This is purely a   
 village club,though members from      
 nearby villages use the court.Summer  
 visitors pay by the hour.
