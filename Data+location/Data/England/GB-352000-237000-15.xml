		<title>15Hampton Bishop Area.</title>
		<content>   Hampton Bishop is traditionally a   
 farming village and a good deal of    
 agriculture is still practised.       
                                       
  In recent years more homes have been 
 built and many are now owned by people
 who are not connected with farming.   
 There is quite a high proportion of   
 old people living in the village and  
 it may be that it is becoming known as
 as a retirement village.              
                                       
  The fields are mostly used to grow   
 grass and we saw sheep , dairy cattle 
 and bullocks grazing in them.         
                                       
  Some of the fields were being used   
 for the production of hay or silage   
 for winter feeding.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
