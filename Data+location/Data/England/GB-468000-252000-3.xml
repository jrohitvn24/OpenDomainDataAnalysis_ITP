		<title>03Gayton's Shopping Problems</title>
		<content>                                       
In Gayton there is only 1 shop.        
The shop is a Post Office which was    
opened in 1984. It sells milk, eggs,   
newspapers, greetings cards and        
sweets.                                
                                       
On Wednesdays a Mobile Shop goes round 
Gayton but most people  do their       
shopping in Northampton because it     
costs less even though they have to    
pay to get there. The milkman sells    
bread as well as milk.                 
                                       
People said that if a new shop was     
opened in Gayton they would want it to 
be a general store. There used to be a 
general store, but the villagers did   
not use it so it closed down.          
It was open for 4 years.
