		<content>{ Horses}are very much part of village 
 life.None are working horses _all are 
 used for sport and recreation.        
 Fox_hunting and gymkhanas are held in 
 the area. There is a small riding     
 school on one of the farms and a small
 stud which raises and trains          
 steeplechasers.                       
{ Dogs}are very popular in the village.
 Most are household pets and some are  
 effective guard dogs. Many breeds are 
 to be found_the most popular being the
 Labrador.Some of the farms have       
 trained gun dogs which are used on    
 pheasant shoots.The kennels of the    
 South Notts Hunt are in the area to   
 the west of the village.The fox_hounds
 are often to be seen being exercised  
 through the village.
