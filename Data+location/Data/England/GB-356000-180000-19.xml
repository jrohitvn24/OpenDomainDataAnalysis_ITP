		<title>19Patchway Pensioners' Centre.</title>
		<content>   Around 1973 a group was set up, with
 Â£3.50 funds, in a room in the         
 Community Centre, making and selling  
 items.  All the proceeds went into a  
 building fund to provide a day centre 
 for old age pensioners who live on    
 their own.  They worked for 7 years.  
   The Parish Council gave the land.   
 "Help the Aged" and the Almondsbury   
 Charities contributed.  In 1980 the   
 Day Centre opened.  The Davis Trust   
 furnished the Centre.                 
   They now own their own building, run
 by three officers and ten committee,  
 all old age pensioners.  They pay all 
 their own bills and are completely    
 independent.                          
   The Centre is open from 9am to 4pm  
 on Mondays and from 9am to 12am on    
 Wednesdays and Thursdays.             
   The voluntary cook is an old age    
 pensioner.  She has two helpers.      </content>
