		<title>09A day in my life</title>
		<content> I get up at 7. I go downstairs and    
 have my breakfast. Sometimes I have   
 egg omlette and sometimes I have it   
 with beans. After my breakfast I go   
 upstairs and get dressed. At 8.45 I go
 to school. At school we get our       
 activity book out and do some work.   
 Today we wrote about going shopping.  
 We wrote about things we like doing   
 and things we don't like doing. At 12 
 we have our dinner and at 12.30 we go 
 out to play. At one we come in. In the
 afternoon we play rounders. At 2.30 we
 have playtime. At 2.45 we come in and 
 have a story. At 3.15 we go home. I   
 play out and at 7.30 I have my tea and
 then go to bed.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
