		<content>   On Wednesday 19th June 1985 seven   
 Plympton Primary schools gathered     
 together for the area sports. These   
 were held at the Ridgeway             
 Comprehensive School. The new Lord    
 Mayor presented the prizes for the    
 winning schools. For the first time in
 four years Glen Park Primary School   
 was presented with a cup. The schools 
 taking part were: Old Priory,         
 Boringdon, Plympton St Maurice,       
 Woodford, Chaddlewood, Glen Park and  
 Yealmpstone Farm.                     
   Among the races were the obstacle   
 race and flat race. Old Priory came   
 first, Chaddlewood second and Glen    
 Park third.                           
   The children of Glen Park were      
 delighted to come third. The          
 spectators gave a lot of support and  
 kept the runners going. It was an     
 exciting and enjoyable day.           </content>
