<title>24Fish Farming and Ecology</title>
<content>

The land belongs to the local Shaftesbury estate and the trout farm is now exclusively owned by the same estate. The original partner has retired but one of the workers in 1986 has become the manager. He and his wife now live on - site and have grown-up children. He has been there for thirty years. Other workers live in the cottages opposite. One family has small children under school age.&lt;br />&lt;br />All fish leave live to restock lakes and fish farms across the country. No fish is available for table as in the past.   &lt;br />
