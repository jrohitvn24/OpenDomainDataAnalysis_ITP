		<content>{ Overcombe and Bowleaze Cove}are both 
 big attractions with holidaymakers.The
 beach in particular is very popular.  
 Here people swim, water-ski, sail     
 boats, sunbathe and most of all they  
 windsurf. They come from all over the 
 South Coast to participate in this    
 activity.                             
  A cafe and ice-cream kiosk can be    
 found in both places.Bowleaze has more
 holidaymakers,because there are four  
 large caravan parks nearby. Bowleaze  
 also has a play centre, a paddle boat 
 lake,a small train,an amusement arcade
 and a trampoline. Bowleaze is also the
 start for walks over the cliffs       
 towards Osmington                     
  Near Bowleaze are the remains of a   
 Roman Temple, which can be visited.The
 hill between Bowleaze and Overcombe is
 great for flying kites.
