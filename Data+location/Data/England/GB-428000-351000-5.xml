		<content> MOST OF THE FARMS IN THE AREA ARE     
 QUITE SMALL, UNDER 50 ACRES, ALTHOUGH 
 THERE ARE TWO LARGER FARMS TOWARD     
 ALDERWASLEY THAT CONCENTRATE ON CROP  
 PRODUCTION, BARLEY, OIL SEED RAPE AND 
 WHEAT. THE REMAINDER OF THE FARMS ARE 
 MIXED; HAVING ANIMALS, BEEF CATTLE,   
 MILKING HERDS, GOATS, CHICKENS,       
 GEESE, DUCKS AND SHEEP; FIELDS THAT   
 ARE MAINLY SET ASIDE AS ROUGH PASTURE 
 OR GRASSLAND FOR THE HAY CROP WITH    
 SOME OF THE LAND USED FOR POTATOES,   
 GREEN VEGETABLES AND CORN. SOME OF THE
 HILLSIDES ARE STEEP AND HAVE BECOME   
 WOODED AND COVERED WITH GORSE.        
 THE NARROW ROADS AND TRACKS ARE KEPT  
 CLEAN AND ALTHOUGH THE FARM YARDS ARE 
 IN CONSTANT USE THEY TOO ARE WELL KEPT
 AND MAINTAINED.                       
 ONLY A FEW LOCAL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT    
 LIVE ON THE FARMS AND SMALLHOLDINGS   
 WORK ON THE LAND. FAMILY CONCERNS.    </content>
