		<content> This area, being comparatively free of
 pollution, provides a good habitat for
 flora and fauna. Farm sprays are the  
 worst problem, but these are now being
 used with more thought. The Heythrop  
 Hunt take great care of the fox       
 population, and there are many badger 
 earths.                               
 A wide variety of wild flowers can be 
 found on the Roman Road, and the      
 outskirts of the quarry also provide  
 an excellent habitat.                 
 Butterflies and birds also abound.    
 Hares and partridges are not so       
 prevalent as they were 25 years ago,  
 and this is also attributed to modern 
 farming methods.                      
 Kineton Hill land is completely       
 unfertilised and full of natural      
 flora. Nearby land has a large colony 
 of Autumn Crocus.
