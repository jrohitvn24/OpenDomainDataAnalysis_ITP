		<content> Farming occupies quite a large        
 proportion of our D. block. The names 
 of some farms are Dunkirk or Hankey's 
 farm, Longacre, Ouston Bank farm and  
 Riding Farm. The soil is mostly       
 glacial drift with poor drainage but  
 in general is quite fertile. Nearly   
 all the farmland has been affected at 
 some time by mining, open cast, clay  
 pits and subsidence. Crops grown      
 include potatoes, swede, wheat,       
 barley, kale, intensive grassland and 
 recently oil seed rape. Most farms are
 mixed and have beef cattle, some pigs 
 and sheep. Long Acre farm used to have
 1OO British Friesian cows but they    
 became ill possibly as a result of    
 pollution from a chemical works       
 nearby. Ouston Bank specializes in top
 quality bulls. Farming on the urban   
 fringe has problems eg. vandalism,    
 litter pollution nois and trespassers.</content>
