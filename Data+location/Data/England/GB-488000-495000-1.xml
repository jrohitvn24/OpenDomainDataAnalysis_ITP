		<content> Moors and forest, east of Harwood Dale
 The block is gently undulating        
 moorland with no dominant features.   
 The heather moorland in the north and 
 west is accessible by footpath and as 
 well as walkers, it may be used by    
 grouse shooting and perhaps for bee   
 keeping.                              
 Most of the block however is covered  
 in commercial forestry conifer        
 plantations.  This is a network of    
 forestry tracks for working access but
 no public roads enter the block so its
 potential for tourism is limited to   
 those who are prepared to walk. The   
 block borders on the Fylingdales early
 warning station land so access if     
 further restricted in the north west. 
 There is some rough sheep and cattle  
 grazing along the valley of the       
 Derwent which originates in this      
 block.                                </content>
