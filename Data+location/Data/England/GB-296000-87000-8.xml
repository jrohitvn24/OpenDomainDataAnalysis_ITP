		<title>08THE RIVER EXE FLOODS</title>
		<content> Sometimes when the tide is very high  
 and the weather is very wet the River 
 Exe bursts its banks and floods some  
 of the streets in Topsham. This       
 happened early in 1985 and I remember 
 it clearly. I was staying in the house
 of my friend who lives by the         
 recreation ground. We took the dogs   
 outside for a walk and found that the 
 water had come right up to the gate.  
 It was about 12 cm deep. The dogs were
 afraid of the water but we went along 
 as far as we could and saw other      
 people paddling through the water. In 
 Ferry Road some people even had a     
 small rowing boat to get about in. The
 people had put sandbags against the   
 doors of their houses to stop the     
 water coming in.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
