    The Duddon Inshore Rescue held     
 their dance on 30th March. It was a   
 great success, with Â£160 raised. They 
 are hoping to hold another dance      
 sometime in September. Plans have been
 approved for the new look-out         
 extension and work on the foundation  
 has already begun.                    
    On May 24th a Beach Barbecue was   
 held in conjuction with a disco at the
 Boathouse. Food was provided by the   
 Resident Chef,"Gilly". The money      
 raised on this occasion was donated to
 the Duddon Inshore Rescue.
