 now a first school and has 63 pupils  
 aged from 5 to 10 years ,with 3       
 teachers.Some of the children arrive  
 by bus.Lunches and milk are no longer 
 provided,so the children bring packed 
 lunches.There is a good sized games   
 field and a keen football team.       
     As the Pub was closed by the Lord 
 of the Manor,a hut with a fireplace in
 the middle was used as a meeting place
 until 1947,when the local people asked
 for a club to be built.The hut was    
 replaced by a building on church land.
 The club is run by a Steward .The     
 total membership is 450 and the annual
 subscription is 2.This year a skittle
 alley has been added. Pool,darts,     
 cribbage,dominoes and bingo are also  
 played.Having a bar weddings and      
 parties are catered for.
