		<content> BUS SERVICES: On Monday to Friday     
 there is one bus to Garstang each     
 morning for school children, returning
 in the afternoon.                     
                                       
 On Thursday there are two extra buses 
 because it is market day in Garstang. 
                                       
 On Saturday there are three buses to  
 and from Garstang, but none on Sunday 
                                       
 The fare is 70p for adults, and 35p   
 for children; journey time is 25mins. 
                                       
 There aren't many buses because most  
 people have cars and usually give     
 lifts.                                
                                       
 A TAXI can also be hired in Calder    
 Vale. This is the minibus which takes 
 children to and from Calder Vale      
 School.                               </content>
