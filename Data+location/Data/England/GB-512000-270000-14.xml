		<content> In Spaldwick there are not many houses
 built in the last ten years, only six.
 The houses on the High Street are the 
 oldest houses. Some are more then 300 
 years old.There are many council      
 houses and old peoples bungalows. Some
 people have bought their own council  
 houses. At the moment there are no    
 plans for any more building in        
 Spaldwick. In Ellington there are four
 new housing developments. Ellington is
 a popular village for people to move  
 into because it is close to the A1 and
 the station. Most of the new houses   
 are detached houses with double       
 garages. In Easton the new houses are 
 very big and expensive. There are not 
 many of them. Easton is the smallest  
 village, but it has more thatched     
 houses then Ellington or Spaldwick.
