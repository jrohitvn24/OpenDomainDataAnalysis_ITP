		<title>02A bypass for Glastonbury</title>
		<content> As far as most people are concerned   
 the town desperately needs a{bypass.  
 At present it is very dangerous for   
 children and older people to cross the
 High Street. Sometimes the cars do not
 even stop at the Zebra crossing.      
 There are often cars parked on the    
 side of the main road and with heavy  
 goods lorries and other large vehicles
 rumbling through the main thoroughfare
 there is the added aggravation of     
{noise and pollution as well as danger 
 to pedestrians. Many people feel that 
 if the High Street was turned into a  
{pedestrian precinct}with flower       
 beds,trees and benches like Bath, the 
 place would become much more          
 attractive to both residents and      
 tourists. People are worried that the 
 council is not taking enough action to
 get the scheme under way.
