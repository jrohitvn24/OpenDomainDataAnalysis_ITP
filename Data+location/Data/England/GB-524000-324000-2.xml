		<content>    { FARMING IN THE AREA - CROPS      
{     ___________________________      
    The main crops grown in the area   
 are generally high value arable crops 
 such as{Vegetables, Wheat and Barley, 
{Sugar Beet, Potatoes and Flower Bulbs.
 The reason why these crops are grown  
 here is because of the type of soil   
 and conditions found in this part of  
 England. It is some of the most       
 fertile land in Great Britain. It is  
 for this reason that these high value 
 crops, which demand deep rich soil,   
 can be grown so well.                 
    In future years it is extremely    
 unlikely that there is going to a     
 major change in the type of crops     
 being grown here. The price of land in
 this area is such that farmers cannot 
 afford to grow crops and lesser value 
 if they are to obtain a benefit from  
 their financial investment.           </content>
