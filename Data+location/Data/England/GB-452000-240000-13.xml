		<title>13Birds of the Greatworth area</title>
		<content> The ecology of the area is greatly    
 benefited by the presence of a wide   
 range of birds.A member of the Royal  
 Society for the protection of birds   
 has observed 104 different species of 
 birds over the past twelve years.Most 
 of the common birds frequent the area 
 along with............                
 kingfishers,sparrowhawks,great spotted
 and green lesser spotted woodpeckers. 
 Rare birds which visit this area are  
 the kite which was seen in 1972 and   
 the nightingale which has not been    
 seen or heard since 1971.The hobby    
 which is a rare falcon has been       
 several times each summer and is      
 thought to nest locally.              
 The R.S.P.B. member lives at the      
 Reading Room, Greatworth.She looks    
 after many injured birds and animals  
 brought to her by the children of the 
 village.                              </content>
