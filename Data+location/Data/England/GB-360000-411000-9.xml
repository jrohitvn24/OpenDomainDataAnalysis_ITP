		<title>09THE TWO SIDES OF HORWICH</title>
		<content>    The South Eastern corner of the    
 block contains the most significant   
 settlement in our area, the railway   
 town of HORWICH.                      
    Chorley Old Road climbs from Lee   
 Lane towards the Parish Church,an area
 where the Anglo-Saxon farm settlement,
 "an enclosure on the higher ground"   
 must have been". At the foot of Lee   
 Lane and the head of Scholes Bank the 
 rough stone walls and thin flagged    
 roofs indicate the remains of         
 Eighteenth Century housing. Old Road  
 itself was an early turnpike of 1787  
 with a toll recalled in the name of   
 the public house "The Toll Bar Inn".  
    The New Road was added in 1822,some
 claim to provide local unemployed with
 labour. Its main significance is that 
 in 1884 the Locomotive Works grew     
 around it,so establishing the "second"
 Horwich.                              </content>
