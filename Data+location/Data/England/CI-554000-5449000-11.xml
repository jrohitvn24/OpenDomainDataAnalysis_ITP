		<title>11Simon's Sand Pit</title>
		<content>   There are few sources of good       
{building sand}available in Jersey and 
 the major supplies come from this sand
 pit.  the pit itself is subject to    
 planning controls and, as a           
 consequence, the workings are         
 surrounded by a considerable bank of  
 vegetated sand.  Other abandoned sand 
 pits have been filled and returned to 
 sandy grassland.                      
                                       
  {Building}in the area is severely    
 restricted and the only ones along the
 coast are those that were there before
 the Second World War.  One farmhouse  
 has been replaced with a crazy golf   
 course. {German}gun emplacements and  
 other bunkers are now regarded as part
 of the historical scene and remain as 
 witness, along with the reinforced    
 concrete sea wall, to the 5 years of  
 German occupation.                    </content>
