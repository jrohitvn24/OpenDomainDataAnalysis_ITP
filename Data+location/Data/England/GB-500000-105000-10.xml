		<title>10A Day with the Deans</title>
		<content>  We are a {family}of seven; the       
 youngest are twin boys-6yrs, my next  
 brother-8,my sister-10,me-11,+Mum+Dad.
  At the weekend we all get up between 
 7.30 and 8.30am. We have breakfast    
 before watching some television. Our  
 Mum gets rather aggravated that we    
 just sit round watching the T.V., so  
 she tells us to help her tidy up the  
 house.                                
  For lunch we usually have a big meal 
 like sausage and chips. After lunch we
 go and play around outside or go to   
 the swimming.                         
  We have a dog, a golden retriever    
 that we have to take for daily walks. 
 We give him fresh water and food every
 morning.                              
  At about 5 pm we have tea, sandwiches
 etc. We then watch T.V. again while   
 Mum and Dad have their dinner and soon
 it is time for bed.                   </content>
