		<title>09My Holiday-Going To London</title>
		<content> One morning we had to wake up at half 
 past five to go to London. We went to 
 Grimsby railway station. We got on the
 train. It took us about two and a half
 hours to get to London. First we went 
 on a bus to the zoo. There were seals,
 lions, birds and all different kinds  
 of animals. After we went there, we   
 went to the waxworks. We went to St.  
 Paul's Cathedral, but it was closed.  
 I bought some gifts from London then  
 we went back on the train. We got back
 home late at night.
