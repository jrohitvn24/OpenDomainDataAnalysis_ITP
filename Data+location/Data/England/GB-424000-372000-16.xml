		<content>    St.Anne's Church has existed for   
 800 years. It has over 150 members.   
 There are 4 services each Sunday and  
 activities include the Choir, Mothers'
 Union, Men's Society, Bible Study, and
 bell ringing. Young people may attend 
 the Youth Club, the Discoverers       
 group,and sing in the Choir.The Vicar 
 is a Governor of the village C.E.     
 primary school.                       
                                       
    The original Methodist Chapel was  
 sold several years ago but the        
 existing Sunday School was extensively
 redesigned and emerged as the new     
 Chapel, which is also used for        
 meetings and coffee mornings. Close   
 links exist with St. Anne's Church and
 both run the Sunday School and Youth  
 Club. United services are held every  
 quarter and on special occasions.
