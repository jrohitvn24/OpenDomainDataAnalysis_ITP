   There has been a Baptist meeting    
place in Gretton since 1786.           
Originally people had to walk from     
Gretton to the Fuller Baptist Church in
Kettering, a distance of 13 miles.     
Some walked even further from places   
like Uppingham.  The first chapel which
was built in Gretton was called the    
Church of Christ.  In 1825 a building  
in the High Street was licensed for    
worship, which brought all the people  
from neighbouring places to Gretton.  A
Sunday School was started in 1842 with 
three meetings during the day; now     
there is one.  Unlike the Parish       
Church, there is no altar.  The Baptist
Minister lives in a large house,       
situated next to the Chapel, called    
"The Manse".
