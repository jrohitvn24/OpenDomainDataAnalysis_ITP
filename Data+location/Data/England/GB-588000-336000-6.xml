		<title>06GAMEKEEPING - EGMERE AREA</title>
		<content> The area comprises parts of the       
 Walsingham and Holkham Estates. It is 
{good shooting country.}Large fields of
 light, stony soil abound. There are   
 small woods mainly of pine planted to 
 screen the disused airfield living    
 quarters. The game is almost all truly
 wild.{Pheasant red leg and grey       
{partridge}thrive under the care of    
{gamekeepers.}They control{predators   
 such as stoats, weasels, rats and     
 corvids. The fox is rarely seen here. 
{Partridges}are shot only when the     
 weather has allowed chicks to survive 
 in numbers above a balanced breeding  
 stock.{Pheasants}are usually shot four
 times a year. An annual bag of 250    
 might be taken from this part of Wals-
 ingham Estate. The Holkham Estate is  
 shot privately by the owners and their
 guests. Walsingham shooting is leased 
 to G. Joyce Esq.                      </content>
