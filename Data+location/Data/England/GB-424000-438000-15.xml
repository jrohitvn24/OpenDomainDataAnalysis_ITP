		<title>15Attitudes</title>
		<content> There are a lot of mixed attitudes in 
 the area :most of them are to do with 
 the new council estate.Those who live 
 in the new houses like the area vrey  
 much but the others think there have  
 been too many changes.Some people are 
 disgusted with the amount of traffic  
 they receive through their village and
 the amount of pollution it causes.They
 say that a lot more suitable route    
 should be made to and from the        
 ringroad.                             
 The local residents believe that if   
 houses can be built,continuosly       
 expanding the city then some playing  
 fields could be made for local        
 schools.Others argue that if these    
 people want to stop city              
 expansion,then they should set a      
 better example.
