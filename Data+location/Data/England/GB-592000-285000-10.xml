		<content> When it is hot, we swim in the river. 
 We go to the playing field, where     
 there are swings, apparatus and goal  
 posts.  We make camps round the edge  
 of the field, or in the woods.        
 Sometimes we cycle down to Harling on 
 our bikes to buy some sweets.         
                                       
 We often have friends over for the day
 or weekend, because there are not a   
 lot of children our age in the        
 village.  Sometimes we get together   
 with other girls and boys and bike    
 somewhere, or make a camp.   We like  
 climbing trees.  Some days we watch   
 football matches on the playing field.
 When the weather is nice we go on     
 picnics, or roller skate around Risley
 Close.
