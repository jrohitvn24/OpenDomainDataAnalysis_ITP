as a signalman.He lived in Ludgershall 
before moving into the area.He likes   
Watchfield a lot and would not like it 
to be changed in any way.Mr.Curtis     
approves of the bypass and said it made
Watchfield less crowded.He also said it
made the old A420 less dangerous than  
before.Mr. Curtis said that the College
on the other side of the road has      
changed the atmosphere in a way that   
the population has increased a lot.If  
he had a choice of living anywhere else

He said that the only major disaster in
Watchfield was before he was born when 
there were two murders and one         
attempted murder.The killer was caught 
and hanged in Reading in 1893.         </content>
