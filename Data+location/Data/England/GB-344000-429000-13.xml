Over 70% of the landscape is rural; the
horizon is broken by woods, copses and 
thickets in all directions with the    
occasional farm or other isolated house
appearing. To the south it is mainly   
flat farmland.                         
INDUSTRIAL                             
The skyline is broken to the north by  
the silhouettes of the buildings of    
B.N.F.L. Salwick which is in blocks 31 
46 and 31 47.A sign of past industry is
the Clifton windmill, in 31 46 and the 
station at Salwick is on the northern  
boundary on line 32, E of 46.

N.E.of 31 44 and the N.W. of 30 45,    
there being just under 400 houses      
there.At Clifton there are just over   
200 houses; nearly all are in 30 46.
