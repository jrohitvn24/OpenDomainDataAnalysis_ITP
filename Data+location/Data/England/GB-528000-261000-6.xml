		<title>06Housing in Elsworth</title>
		<content> Elsworth has 218 houses of which two  
 are Tudor and a number are thatched   
 cottages and houses from intervening  
 periods. There has been some modern   
 development but this is restricted as 
 most of the land cannot be changed    
 from agricultural to residential.     
                                       
 Elsworth is a very desirable area and 
 house prices are high. There is little
 council housing and young families    
 find that they cannot afford the      
 houses. This is leading to a state    
 where only older people move to the   
 village with consequent social        
 implications.
