		<content> The formation of the Youth Club in    
 1983 provided a social meeting place  
 for the young who otherwise never met-
 attending different schools and       
 travelling outside Stagsden for       
 leisure activities such as Scouts and 
 Guides in Bromham, swimming and cinema
 in Bedford.The club has around 35     
 members aged 9-17 who pay  a          
 subscription of Â£1 per year and 20p   
 session fee.Further funds are raised  
 from the refreshment sales and        
 sponsored events.Activities include   
 disco's (open-air this year!)         
 barbeque,table tennis, Fun Run,       
 entering competions such as indoor    
 hockey and Superdance (4 girls reached
 the Regional finals) swimming trips to
 Bletchley, trips to the Ballet and    
 Wicksteed Park. The local pub allows  
 them the use of their mini-bus or they
 hire a coach.                         </content>
