		<content> The year's events start on Shrove     
 Tuesday with Pancake tossing, and a   
 gathering for hot pancakes and coffee 
 in the Village Hall.  On Easter Sunday
 there is Egg Rolling and a children's 
 Easter Bonnet Parade, with            
 refreshments afterwards.  In August a 
 children's Gymkhana is held, from     
 Leading Rein to Show Jumping;  this is
 in conjunction with a Fete for the    
 Village Hall.   A Flower Festival     
 takes place in the Church, the profits
 going to the Church Restoration Fund. 
 On 5th November a Bonfire, Fireworks  
 Display and a Barbeque are organised  
 on the Sports Field.  December sees   
 the annual Church Bazaar, and nearer  
 Christmas the W.I. organises a Supper 
 Party for the villagers.  Other events
 include Hunt Meets Coffee Mornings and
 Bingo Evenings.
