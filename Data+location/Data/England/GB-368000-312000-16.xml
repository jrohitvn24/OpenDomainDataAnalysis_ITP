		<title>16ANGLERS in TRENCH,TELFORD.</title>
		<content> Mr. Price is chairman of Summerfield  
 Angling Club and has Â£600 worth of    
 tackle.He fishes both Trench and      
 Middle Pools but prefers Trench Pool  
 because the fish are bigger! The      
 heaviest fish caught in Trench Pool   
 was a carp weighing 14kg.The pool is  
 well-known for its pike - the largest 
 caught weighed 10kg.The most commonly 
 used baits used here are maggots,bread
 luncheon meat and worms.Mr.Price likes
 to go fishing at dawn on a summer day.
 He often enters competitions and has  
 won 10 trophies.                      
   Mr. McLeod goes fishing once a week,
 usually for about 6 hours.He does not 
 belong to a club.He uses a fibre-glass
 rod and the same baits as Mr.Price.He 
 also enjoys fishing early on a summer 
 day but prefers to fish Middle Pool as
 there are more fish there even though 
 they are smaller!                     </content>
