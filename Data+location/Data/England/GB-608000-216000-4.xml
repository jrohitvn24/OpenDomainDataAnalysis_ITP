		<title>04Police Station contd.</title>
		<content> The new station is to open on{July    
{15th.1985.}It has been built for a    
 Sergeant and eight Constables.There   
 are two offices-one for the Sergeant  
 and one for the{C.I.D}officer as well 
 as the foyer which is the main office 
 type area for the Constables, the     
 public stop at a smart blue counter   
 just inside the front door.{The Police
{Station}is not as big as the old one  
 and all the rooms are fairly small. It
 has got a Ladies toilet, which the old
 one did not have, a rest room and a   
 kitchen for the policemen. There are  
 no cells and criminals are taken to   
{Clacton}for detention. The windows in 
 the roof have been specially designed 
 so that rain can not get in even if   
 the windows are open.
