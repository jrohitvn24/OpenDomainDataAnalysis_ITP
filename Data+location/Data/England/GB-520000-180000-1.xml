		<content>This area is part of a densely         
populated section of West London       
called North Hammersmith and College   
Park.The primary land cover is         
residential. Industry is the secondary 
land cover. The industry is split into 
areas of industrial estates, mainly    
situated in the North-West of the      
area. A smaller section of the         
industry is also in the South-East.    
The railway lines cut the area into    
three sections with a large siding and 
depot in the North. This is surrounded 
by industry and wasteland.The          
wasteland features in the centre of    
the area and is quite famous. The      
canal runs alongside the railway line. 
There are a few shops gathered togther 
in areas amongst the houses. There are 
also various assorted public buildings 
and two cemeteries.
