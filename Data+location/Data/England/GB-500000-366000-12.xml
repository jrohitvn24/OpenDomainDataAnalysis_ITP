		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN BRANSTON</title>
		<content> We asked 52 children in school what   
 their dads did for a living.Engineer  
 and mechanic were the most popular    
 jobs.With having 3 air fields near by 
 there were a lot of Service Personnel.
 Also with a lot of farms in Branston  
 there were a lot of farmworkers.Out   
 of the 52 children we asked 2 of      
 their dads were unemployed and 2 self 
 employed.We also asked 31 children    
 what their mums did for a living.Most 
 of their mums were housewives,but     
 because there are 11 shops in Branston
 a lot of their mums are shopworkers.We
 also tried to work out which jobs were
 manual and non-manual.Most jobs were  
 manual.For example,engineer,factory   
 worker,farmworker and service         
 personnel.We decided that non-manual  
 jobs were,teacher,officeworker,       
 bankworker and Insurance Agent.
