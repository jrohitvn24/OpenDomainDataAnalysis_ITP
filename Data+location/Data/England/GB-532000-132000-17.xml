		<title>17CHIDDINGLYE AND GRAVETYE</title>
		<content> The path from the{White Hart Inn}to   
{West Hoathly}goes across the valley   
 and through{Chiddinglye,}formerly the 
 estate of the{Tudor ironmasters,}the  
{Michells.}The farmhouse dates from the
 16th century with a 17th century barn.
  {Gravetye Woods,}in the care of the  
{Forestry Commission,}are well worth a 
 visit. They are part of the old forest
 of the{Weald}and were largely         
 replanted by the{famous gardener      
{William Robinson,}who lived in        
{Gravetye Manor}from 1884-1935 and also
 laid out the gardens. He planted more 
 than 120,000 trees, including many    
 unusual evergreens. There are many    
 walks and a fine viewpoint about 1km  
 from the carpark in{Vowels Lane.}The  
 Manor is now a{hotel and country club 
 but the gardens are open to the public
 on Tuesdays and Fridays from 10am to  
 5pm.                                  </content>
