		<title>08NEW BUILDINGS IN WOODHOUSE</title>
		<content>{ Our school was built in 1845 and is  
{one of the oldest public buildings in 
{Mansfield Woodhouse.}Next door is one 
 of the newest,{The Woodhouse Centre.  
 This consists mainly of the{Co-op     
{Superstore}which opened in the autumn 
 of 1984. Before it was built there was
 considerable opposition to the        
 development on{environmental grounds. 
 The store was not only to be in the   
 centre of the town but also in the    
 middle of a{Conservation Area.}The{Old
{Mansfield Woodhouse Society}played a  
 great part in the debate and although 
 the development went ahead it has been
 skillfully blended into the area.Most 
 people now see the Centre as an asset 
 to the town.The Centre includes{8 shop
{units, Building Society/Estate Agents 
{officies and T.S.B.bank.}The{Angel Inn
 was extended and all were{limestone   
 faced.           Class 4 S.E.         </content>
