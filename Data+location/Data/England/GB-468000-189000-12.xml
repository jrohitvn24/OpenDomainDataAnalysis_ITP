A Jazz Group plays at the Beehive      
Public House every second Wednesday    
evening during the winter.  The group  
consists of four semi-professional     
musicians.  Some members play two or   
three instruments, guest musicians and 
singers appear occassionally either by 
arrangement or on a casual basis.      
There is no charge for admission, but  
there is a collection during the       
evening.                               
The evenings are usually very well     
attended, people travel long distances 
to listen to the music.
