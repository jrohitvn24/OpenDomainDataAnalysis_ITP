   There are 32 children at Spreyton   
 School.We come here when we are 5     
 years old and leave when we are 11    
 years old.Because we are a village    
 school and our Mums and Dads and all  
 the people around help us a lot,we    
 asked them to join in with our        
 Domesday Project.                     
   All of us helped to do the Project  
 and we organised it as our theme,just 
 like the other themes we wrote about  
 on pages 9 and 10.                    
 When we had finished our Project we   
 had an exhibition to show the village 
 our work.We had to tell our visitors  
 all about it,like a guide showing     
 people round a castle and we served   
 coffee and we made Domesday house and 
 Domesday people biscuits.It was great 
 fun.
