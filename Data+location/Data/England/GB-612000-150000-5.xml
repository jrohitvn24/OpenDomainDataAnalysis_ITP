		<content> The village{Church}is probably the    
 only continuous link with the original
 Domesday Survey.                      
 Petham has become a sought after      
{residential area}for the retired and  
 those working in Canterbury.{Car      
{ownership}is, of necessity, high and  
 the city with its extensive facilities
 is little more than  ten minute's     
 journey away. The{small amount of     
{employment}that exists is almost      
 exclusively connected                 
 with{agriculture or horticulture.     
 Apart from this the local public      
 houses with eating facilities provide 
 some employment (part-time), as does a
 large country house converted to a    
 nursing home and the primary school.
