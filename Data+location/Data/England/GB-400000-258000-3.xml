		<title>03BUILDINGS IN HOLBERROW GREEN</title>
		<content> Most buildings are brick built and    
 serve as dwelling houses.  There is no
 church, only a chapel that was        
 converted to a house before the end of
 the 19th century. A small number of   
 out-buildings and barns are of        
 sufficient interest to be listed.     
                                       
 Houses vary in size and age, post 1945
 being in the minority.  Many of the   
 old farming cottages have been        
 extended and modernised successfully  
 blending the new and the old.
