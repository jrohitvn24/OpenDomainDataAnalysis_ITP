		<title>07A SCHOOL IN THE PEWSEY VALE</title>
		<content> Oare School is a small school. It has 
 three classrooms, a library, a music  
 room and a computer area.             
   At the start of each day there is an
 assembly. The local vicar takes this  
 service once a week. Each day we have 
 a mathematics lesson and an English   
 one. Other things we study are Topic  
 work, which includes Geography,       
 History and Science; Art, Music, R.E. 
 and Games.                            
   During lunch-times we can learn to  
 play recorders, guitars and           
 hand-bells.                           
   We play many different types of     
 games and take part in local football 
 and netball tournaments.              
   At Christmas we have a Carol Service
 which includes poetry and a short     
 play. In the summer term we have a    
 Concert consisting of a play and many 
 musical items.                        </content>
