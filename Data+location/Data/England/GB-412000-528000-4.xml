 used for grazing the sheep and the    
 cows.  In other fields the grass is   
 encouraged to grow by using high      
 nitrogen fertilizer and also farmyard 
 manure in order to get grass for      
 silage.  This crop is cut in the      
 early summer and allowed to wilt      
 overnight in the field.  It is then   
 gathered by a forage harvester which  
 cuts it into 2.5 cm pieces and blows  
 it into a trailer.  It is then taken  
 to a shed where the grass is emptied  
 into a large pile surrounded by a     
 large plastic sheet.  A tractor runs  
 up and down the pile trying to squeeze
 as much air as possible out of the    
 grass.  The pile is enclosed inside   
 the plastic sheeting and it ferments  
 to eventually become an edible winter 
 feed.                                 
    In some fields the grass is allowed</content>
