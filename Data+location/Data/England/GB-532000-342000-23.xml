<title>23McKnight Annexe-Then and Now</title>
<content>

I was surprised to find my old School on here after hearing about the rediscovered project on Radio 2 the other day. McKnight Annexe was merged with Staniland School in 1987, the old Victorian Staniland building on George Street was demolished after the merger and McKnight Annexe became the new Staniland School, i understand that extensions were built around this time to accommodate the new influx of schoolkids. When the two schools merged i was 7-i don't have many good memories of the school as i found it to be more of a strict regime, with some teachers with a surprisingly low child tolerance level, although Mrs Buckley, quoted in the original article was a lovely woman!&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
