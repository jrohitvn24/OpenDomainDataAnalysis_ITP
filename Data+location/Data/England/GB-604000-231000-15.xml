		<title>15Life in Tourist Dedham</title>
		<content> Dedham is a very beautiful village so 
 lots of people from all over the world
 come here. I live in Royal Square in a
 500yr old house between the hair _    
 dresser and the Marlborough Head. When
 we go out in our car six cars are     
 waiting for our space.  When we return
 we often have to park a long way away 
 and move the car later. Coaches are   
 worse; they take four spaces or else  
 park beside you, blocking you in.     
 If we forget to lock our door people  
 walk in and ask if we are serving     
 dinner. They are not so keen when they
 hear it is fish fingers. They even go 
 upstairs looking for the hairdressers 
 or ask if they can use the toilet.    
 Even so it is handy living in the High
 Street. If you want a Mars bar you can
 go across to the shop and get one. If 
 the shop is not full of tourists.
