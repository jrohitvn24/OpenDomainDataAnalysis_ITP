		<content> Hawk Lake is a long,narrow,{man-made  
 lake about 2miles long most of which  
 falls within our Domesday Block.The

 grounds of{Hawkstone Hall}were        
{landscaped.}The south west bank is    
{open parkland}running down to the lake
 but the the north-east bank is marked 
 by a narrow strip of{woodland,}mostly 
{alders and sycamores}planted on top of
 the{dam.}This strip is about 50 feet  
 higher than the surrounding farmland. 
 The lake is edged with{reeds}and      
{yellow iris}and{coots,ducks}and       
{moorhens}nest there.The lake is not   
 used now for boating although there is
 a disused boathouse on the south bank.
 The{angling}rights are owned by Wem   
{Anglers' Club.}The fish mostly caught 
 is{carp.}There is a small{caravan site
 at the north end of lake and a        
{footpath}along the top of the dam.    </content>
