		<title>06ARABLE FARMING/TEST VALLEY</title>
		<content>  The land on Broadlands Farm is mainly
 flat,near to the river Test.It is part
 of the floodplain and sometimes the   
 river breaks its banks and floods the 
 fields in winter.Twelve hectares are  
 marshy and ditches have been dug to   
 drain this.The rest is gently sloping,
 bar ten hectares,which are too steep  
 for farm machinery.                   
  There is silty soil in the valley    
 and gravel and sand on the slopes.Some
 soil is thin and dry,and needs        
 fertilisers.They use potash,phosphates
 and nitrates with some trace elements.
  The most important crop is wheat     
 which is sold to the millers,oil seed 
 rape,sold to the crushers,barley and  
 herbage seed,which goes to the seed   
 merchants.This year,for the first     
 time,they started growing peas,which  
 together with feed wheat,are used to  
 feed livestock on the farm.           </content>
