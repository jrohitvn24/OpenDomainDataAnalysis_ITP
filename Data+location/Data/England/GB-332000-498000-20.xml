		<content> The usual methods of communication    
 i.e. post, telephone and word of mouth
 apply to this area. As in most rural  
 areas messages are carried by the     
 grocery ven, the butcher and the      
 postman. Television is available in   
 almost all homes and reception is     
 good. There is a local, free weekly   
 paper, and the post office sells all  
 the usual daily papers plus the weekly
 Ulverston News and the Westmorland    
 Gazette. It is a singularly self      
 contained population not concerned    
 with outside issues. Life is very safe
 and very sweet and one feels that the 
 locals are closely in touch with      
 nature. This information was compiled 
 by the Rusland and District Women's   
 Institute.
