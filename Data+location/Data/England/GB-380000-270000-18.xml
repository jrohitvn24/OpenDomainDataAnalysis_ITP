		<content>   We interviewed the{chief reporter}of
 the Stourport News.She told us that   
 there is no typical day being a       
{journalist.}The day starts with the   
 opening of the post to see what is to 
 happen that day.A diary is also used  
 for this purpose.After this each      
 journalist is given their assignment  
 for the day,their time being split    
 between collecting and writing        
 stories.Their are different levels of 
 journalists from trainees to the      
 editor who controls the paper.The     
 paper is{distributed free of charge   
 throughout Stourport,Bewdley,         
 Kidderminster and the surrounding     
 villages.Working on the newspaper are 
 5 journalists,a chief reporter,deputy
