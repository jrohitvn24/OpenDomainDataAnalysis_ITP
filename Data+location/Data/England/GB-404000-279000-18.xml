		<content>My favourite toy is the Zoids Giant    
Zrk. It is a 35 cm{robot dinosaur,}is  
powered by batteries and can walk. As  
it walks its neck rises and falls.     
There are small robots inside the head 
and on the back and 3 swivel guns. At  
the end of the tail a third robot sits 
in a gun emplacement. {Zoids come as a 
kit}and the Giant Zrk took me a few    
hours to build. it cost #10.99. My     
friend's favourite is his {Helicopter  
Technical Lego Set.}It has moving      
rotors and tail, a braking system and  
movable landing gear. There are two red
seats which move and two computers in  
the front cab. It is 40 cm long, took  
two hours to build and cost about #20. 
A third favourite toy is the {Gyro     
Tennis Game}for two people. It involves
hitting a ball attached to a spiral on 
a post. It is a very exciting game but 
sometimes the string comes off the top.</content>
