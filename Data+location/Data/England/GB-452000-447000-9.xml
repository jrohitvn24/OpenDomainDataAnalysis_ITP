		<title>09A Junior Sports Meeting</title>
		<content> Once every summer ten schools take    
 part in a local sports meeting.There  
 are eleven different events.These     
 include:various length running        
 races,relays and other events like    
 skipping,wheelbarrow and sack races.  
 The schools meet on a large field with
 a running  track on which the events  
 take place.If you come first you      
 receive a red rosette,for second a    
 blue and for third a yellow one.To    
 choose our team we had heats first.The
 fastest people raced on the day.Those 
 in the 400m race were sent round the  
 field twice for training.The other    
 people practised their special events 
 on the school field.On the day we did 
 half of the events, had a break for   
 refreshments and then did the         
 others.Some people were in more than  
 one event.                            
                                       </content>
