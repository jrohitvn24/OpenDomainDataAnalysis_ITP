		<title>16Visit To Chelsfield Pottery.</title>
		<content> Chelsfield has a pottery of its own.It
is run by {Mrs.Davidson} who invited us
to have a look around.When we arrived  
Mrs.Davidson lined us up by a long     
table and showed us her kiln where she 
fires her work.When it is working it   
can reach very high temperatures       
sometimes as hot as 1300 centigrade.   
 After seeing the {kiln} we the looked 
at the special safety equipment used   
when Mrs.Davidson unloads the finished 
pots. We all had a go at making a coil 
pot and we were shown how to use our   
thumbs to mould the wet clay into      
place.  Mrs.Davidson then showed us    
some of the moulds that she uses to    
make the pot that she sells to the     
public.One of these was a model of     
{Prince Charles and Lady Diana}.       
Mrs.Davidson sells her pots in her     
shop in the village and before we left 
she gave each of us a model chess piece</content>
