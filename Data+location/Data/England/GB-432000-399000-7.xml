		<title>07The 1984-5 Miners strike.</title>
		<content> The year of the strike was a very     
 miserable one for me as a miners      
 son.At first it did not affect me     
 much,but as it dragged on the whole   
 family was affected.I did not get any 
 pocket money and had to earn 'spending
 money' by collecting poor quality coal
 from old colliery slagheaps.I used to 
 go 'coal-picking',as this was         
 called,every Saturday.As money got    
 short we were given free food which we
 collected from the Miners Welfare.    
                                       
 During the winter it was very cold in 
 our house.We burnt coal which my dad  
 and I picked,and wood from the local  
 woods.Now the strike is over we are   
 still paying off bills which we could 
 not pay then.
