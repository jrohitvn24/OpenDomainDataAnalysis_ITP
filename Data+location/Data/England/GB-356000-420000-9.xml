		<content>  {Hide and Seek:}A game for four or   
 more players. The players must choose 
 who will be 'on' and decide on a place
 to use as a base. The player who is   
 'on' must close his eyes and count to 
 100 at the base while everyone else   
 goes to hide (not more than two may   
 hide in any one place). At the end of 
 the count the person who is 'on' must 
 try to find all the other players. If 
 a player (e.g. Peter) is found the    
 person who is 'on' must run to the    
 base and say, "One two three Peter" so
 that Peter is caught. If a player     
 (e.g. Philip) thinks he can run to the
 base before the person who is on he   
 can and must say, "One two three save 
 Philip" when he gets there and then he
 will not be caught. The game goes on  
 until the last player is found. The   
 first player to be found becomes 'on' 
 and the game starts again.            </content>
