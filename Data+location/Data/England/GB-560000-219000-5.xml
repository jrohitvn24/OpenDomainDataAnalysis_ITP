		<title>05The Dunmow Bypass Road</title>
		<content>   Great Dunmow is an old town which is
 situated on a major route running to  
 the ports on the East Coast like      
 Ipswich, Harwich and Felixstowe.      
   With the increase in traffic,       
 especially of container lorries, the  
 route of the A120 through Dunmow      
 caused many problems.  Not only was   
 the town centre seriously congested   
 but there were many accidents which   
 injured people and damaged buildings. 
 As a result it was decided that a     
 bypass was needed to take most of the 
 traffic away from the town.           
   The new road was started in 1978 and
 completed in 1980 with part of its    
 route being along the course of the   
 old railway.  One junction of the     
 bypass has proved to be dangerous,    
 and a roundabout is going to be built 
 to improve safety.
