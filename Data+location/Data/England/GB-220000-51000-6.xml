{Potatoes}                             
 The ground is ploughed in late Autumn 
 or early Winter.The best,"second year 
 lay"soil on the farm is used for      
 potatoes.This ground is harrowed in   
 February and then it is covered with  
 one ton per acre of potash manure.    
 Then it is sprayed for wire worm and  
 grubs in March.Before the potatoes are
 planted,the ground is chiselled and   
 rotavated.The potatoes are planted    
 with an automatic planter.Just        
 before they break the ground,they     
 are sprayed with 'Gramoxone'to kill   
 weeds.Whilst they are growing,they    
 are sprayed against blight every      
 8to10 days.When they,are fully grown  
 the tops are burned off with          
 'Gramoxone' and the potatoes are      
 left to ripen for a fortnight.After   
 that they are harvested and stored.   </content>
