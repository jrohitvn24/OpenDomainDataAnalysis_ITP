		<content>  There are buildings in Trimley and   
Shotley left behind by the Army and the
Navy.  The buildings at H.M.S.Ganges   
are still in good condition but        
elsewhere there are ruins and derelict 
buildings.                             
  On Fagbury Cliff there is a pillbox  
for soldiers to cover the river.       
  In Cordy's Lane,near Keeper's Cottage
there are roadways and concrete        
buildings which children usually call  
"The Fort".  We explored the buildings 
and found places where guns had been   
fixed.  Most of the buildings were     
empty.  A lady who lived in the village
during World War 2 told us that there  
had been anti aircraft guns and search 
lights down there.They were meant to   
protect the motor torpedo boat and     
seaplane bases on the Orwell.
