 On the 20th July out of 15 houses     
 available in Brookmans Park 13 were   
 priced at over Â£100,000 the other two 
 were below this figure. In nearby     
 Welham Green ten houses were for sale 
 9 of which were below Â£100,000 and    
 only two above. House prices between  
 the two villages vary from Â£175,000   
 in Brookmans Park to Â£43,000 in Welham
 Green. Any new housing which is taking
 place in the aea is occurring in      
 Welham Green.                         
     With 5  houses out of 15 above    
 Â£150,000 in Brookmans Park this       
 village is well above the average for 
 the London area where a three         
 bedroomed house sells for Â£50,000 to  
 Â£60,000.This is not surprising for    
 Brookmans Park is in highly desirable 
 commuterland  with large individual   
 houses available.                     </content>
