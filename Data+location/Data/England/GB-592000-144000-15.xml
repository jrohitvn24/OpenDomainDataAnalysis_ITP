		<content> Little is known about{THE MONK}whose  
 spirit haunts the house  which was at 
 one time his home except that he      
 enjoyed a friendly relationship with a
 lady who lived nearby at Rose Court.  
 Accompanied by her pet dogs, she would
 often visit him at the house. Their   
 two ghosts walk the lanes together    
 with the shadows of her dogs close    
 behind.                               
{THE TUDOR LADY}of Rose Court kept two 
 dogs and at times her house echoes to 
 her voice calling them. Her visits    
 occur usually between 4 and 5 o'clock 
 in the afternoon, when she took her   
 own life by drinking poison made from 
 ivy berries. She was last seen looking
 towards Greystones, the home of the   
 monk, with whom she was friends.
