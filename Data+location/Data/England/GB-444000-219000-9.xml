		<content> Most children wear blue jeans and     
 tee-shirts for playing.  In the summer
 shorts are popular.  In school we wear
 a dress or a skirt and blouse.  Some  
 girls wear trousers.  When we go on to
 the Comprehensive School we have to   
 wear school uniform which is grey     
 trousers and a grey, white or blue    
 shirt for the boys and navy blue skirt
 and white or blue blouse for girls.   
 Quite a lot of girls have their ears  
 pierced and so do some of the boys.   
 They wear small gold rings or studs   
 called "sleepers" to stop the hole    
 from sealing up.  In the evenings they
 wear larger, more colourful ear-rings.
 Men who work in offices and shops     
 often go to work in suits with shirts 
 and ties.  Shoes are of leather or    
 plastic and trainers (sports shoes)   
 are very popular for casual wear.
