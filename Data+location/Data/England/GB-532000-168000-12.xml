		<content>   Some of the most common crimes of   
 the Twentieth Century are burglary,   
 theft and vandalism. In 1984 700,000  
 homes were broken into in England and 
 Wales. This disturbing trend has led  
 to the instigation of Neighbourhood   
 Watch schemes in recent years.        
  There has been greater liaison.      
 between the public and the police, who
 can advise on safeguarding homes.     
 Recommended measures are security     
 chains on doors, and such, fanlight or
 arm locks for windows. It is also     
 advisable to mark property either by  
 permanent or invisible marking.       
   In South Norwood itself,there are 40
 burglaries a week,the majority of     
 which occur between between 12 and 2am
 The Neighbourhood Watch scheme,in this
 area as in most others has proved     
 successful in acting as a deterent and
 house crime decreased dramatically.   </content>
