		<content>{COMMUNICATIONS}- Many houses have     
 door bells and burglar alarms.        
{SATELLITE DISHES}- At{Baugh Farm}we   
 saw two satellite dishes about 2m in  
 diameter in a right-angled position   
 for receiving information from        
 satellites at the speed of light.     
{VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS}- We saw many   
 different examples:{road signs,       
{buildings with advertisements}and lots
 of{posters and adverts}outside the    
 shops including{billboards}with       
 newspaper headlines. On buildings we  
 saw one or two window displays and    
 publicity for local events.           
 The{road signs}that we saw were       
 concentrated on the busier roads to   
 help prevent accidents. On the minor  
 roads there were traffic warnings and 
 junction indicators. Near schools were
 flashing yellow warnings to show      
 drivers that children were crossing.  </content>
