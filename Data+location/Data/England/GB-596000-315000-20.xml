		<content> Housing development is governed by the
 policies of the Norfolk Structure     
 Plan. Within the block this has       
 largely restricted new housing to land
 within the village guidelines of New  
 Beetley and Gressenhall.              
 During the 1960's and 70's many new   
 estates were built especially in      
 Beetley. The current village          
 guidelines allow for a much slower    
 rate of growth in both villages. New  
 estate development is likely to be    
 restricted to the completion of       
 existing unfinished estates.          
 In a survey of 57 children aged 9-11  
 it was found that 17 lived on modern  
 housing estates.
