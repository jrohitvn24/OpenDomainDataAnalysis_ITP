		<title>03LANGTON VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>    Langton has been voted one of the  
 prettiest villages in{YORKSHIRE.}It's 
 small,arched windows and fanlights,set
 in slate-roofed stone houses are made 
 from locally quarried{LIMESTONE.}They 
 stand alongside the road and around   
 the Cherry tree-lined 'Green.In the   
 1800's these were Estate worker's     
 homes.Many are still rented from the  
 Estate.The old school was just 45 sq.m
 approx!The village has been well kept 
 and has changed little since being    
 re-built between 1820 and 1840.       
    More recent buildings have been    
 made to blend with the older cottages.
{St.ANDREW'S CHURCH}remains but the old
 Chapel and Blacksmith's shop have gone
 although "CHAPEL ROW" cottages are    
 still occupied.Beech,Elm and Sycamore 
 grow in the village which now has a   
 small Primary School and,at{LANGTON   
{HALL,}a Private Preparatory school.   </content>
