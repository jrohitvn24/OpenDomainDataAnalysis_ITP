		<title>20TRANSPORT IN TERLING</title>
		<content> 1985 has seen a reduction in bus      
 services here. We now have an Eastern 
 National bus each Wednesday leaving   
 Terling at 9.34am for Braintree and   
 returning to the Rayleigh Arms at     
 1.25pm. This costs Â£1.20 return at    
 present. Boons Coaches run a bus      
 service to Witham every Thursday,     
 leaving Terling Post Office at 9.27am 
 and arriving back at 1.16pm. This     
 costs 70pence return fare. The village
 is also served by a Country Car       
 service which costs Â£1.05 return. This
 runs to Braintree and Witham every    
 Saturday.                             
   A coach takes the secondary school  
 children out of the village to Black  
 Notley School. When a survey of how   
 pupils travel to Terling school was   
 made, it was found that 28 came by    
 private car, 4 by taxi, 10 by mini    
 bus, 21 walk and 3 come by bike.      </content>
