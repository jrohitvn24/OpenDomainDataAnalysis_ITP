		<title>01ICE-SKATING</title>
		<content> Once every term, the school plans a   
 treat for the pupils of the school.   
 they take us to a local ice skating   
 rink at Peterbourogh. it costs        
 approximately Â£2.50 to go on the bus  
 and for addmittion into the rink.At   
 the rink they sell skating boots and  
 special clothing. you can also get    
 drink and a meal. there are also      
 machines there which sell sweets and  
 crisps. The rink is quite big and     
 quite crowded,but as the night goes on
 the rink soon starts to empty. At     
 about 8.30 they put a disco on,they   
 have flashing lights and some good    
 music. Later on in the night people   
 get hungry and go in the cafe to get  
 some chips or a bun. After a fun      
 packed 2 hours the bus drivers and the
 teachers are ready to leave.We get on 
 the bus and start the 45 miles journey
 home.We arrive home at 11.30.         </content>
