		<content>     Electricity is not always made in 
 the same part of the country where it 
 is used.To move the electricity from  
 where it is made to where it is used, 
 involves a system of over head power  
 cables carried on pylons linking      
 together with power stations &amp;        
 sub stations on what is often called  
 the Super grid system.                
     The flow of electricity on the    
 super grid system which feeds the main
 sub stations of which Mannington is   
 one needs to be at a high voltage in  
 order to move large amounts of        
 electricity quickly.                  
     This need for a high volume of    
 electricity can be viewed like a river
 the more channels which are at the    
 river taking the river away the       
 greater the volume of water that will 
 be required. As with electricity the  
 load at the end of the cable as to be </content>
