		<title>09Trade - Mr. Taylor</title>
		<content>Mr Taylor has lived in Wickham Market  
since 1920 and has been a shopkeeper   
since he left school. Dealing mainly in
foodstuffs he has sold milk, groceries 
and even secondhand furniture. His shop
on the hill used to have a long counter
behind which he served his customers.  
In those days things like sugar band   
flour were scooped out of a sack or    
barrel and put into brown paper bags   
before being sold. Now everything is in
packets and lies on the shelves for the
customers to help themselves. Nowadays 
he sells such things as frogs legs and 
snails, wines, spirits, many different 
cheeses as well as normal groceries.   
Many years ago Mr Taylor had to go     
round to his customers houses with an  
order book and the next day deliver on 
his bike. Competition was strong, there
were less people and more shops in     
Wickham. Most people shopped in Wickham</content>
