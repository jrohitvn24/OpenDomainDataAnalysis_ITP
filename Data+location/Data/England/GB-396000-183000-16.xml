		<title>16HEDGE SURVEY, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   We visited several areas of hedgerow
 near Little Somerford and we found out
 the following.The hedges are about 1m 
 70 cm tall and 75 cm wide.Most of the 
 hedges we looked at were made of      
 mainly hawthorn and hazel,but we also 
 identified:willow,dogrose,flowering   
 dogwood,elm,hedge maple, blackberry,  
 bluebery, cow parsley, nettle,        
 celandine, herb robert, red campion,  
 foxglove and bitter sweet.Bitter sweet
 is a poisonous plant used in medicine.
 The flowers smell rather like mice. It
 has five purple petals and a yellow   
 centre.The plant likes a damp soil.It 
 is very easy to recognise.            
   We also saw a rare butterfly called 
 a Marbled White.There were many       
 crickets and birds called White       
 Throats.We noticed a few Hoverflies   
 and lots of Ladybirds.
