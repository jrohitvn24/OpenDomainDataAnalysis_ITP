		<title>04AT HOME IN SANTON DOWNHAM</title>
		<content> Santon Downham has mains electricity  
 but no gas. Water is piped to all the 
 village from a F.C. bore_hole. Some of
 the houses are connected to the F.C.  
 sewage works which is currently being 
 improved.                             
 Most of the housing stock is of 2     
 storey, 3 bedroom small houses with   
 gardens. Many date to 1920_1930 but   
 new ones are still being built. There 
 are some much older buildings such as 
 Bridge House and the Old Rectory and  
 some, such as Dog Kennel Cottages,    
 which have been converted from        
 buildings on the old feudal estate.   
 About 90% of the housing is owned by  
 the F.C. but some of the tenants have 
 been given the option to buy the      
 houses they occupy.
