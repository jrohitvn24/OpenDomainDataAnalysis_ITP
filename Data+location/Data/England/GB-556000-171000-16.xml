		<content>{  }The Black Horse public house, once 
 The Black Horse and Fruit Cart Inn,   
 stands in Bean High Street.  The      
 landlord has been nominated Publican  
 of the Year for 1985 by a press group.
 A meeting place for locals, the pub   
 also caters for regulars from outside 
 the village who come to enjoy the real
 ale and pub food.  From a set menu,   
 the most expensive item is a 16 oz.   
 T-bone steak served with vegetables   
 for Â£6.75 with perhaps apple pie and  
 cream to follow at 90p.  An added     
 attraction is the garden where        
 barbecues are held at weekends during 
 the summer.  A pets' corner keeps the 
 children amused.  Once a week the     
 customers are entertained by a blind  
 young man who sings and plays the     
 guitar.
