		<title>09CLEANSING DEPOT: SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content>   Bernard Road is one of Sheffield's  
 largest depots. Trucks for collecting 
 refuse and cleaning streets are       
 garaged and maintained there. Opened  
 in 1975, there is an incineration     
 plant which handles about half of all 
 the refuse collected in{Sheffield.    
   Heat obtained from the incinerator  
 provides heating and hot water for    
 2,500 dwellings on the{Hyde Park      
 estate. This means burning 10 tonnes  
 of refuse every hour.                 
   The{Cleansing Department}collect    
 domestic refuse  rfrom dustbins and   
 make 'special collections' of large   
 items such as old furniture and       
 scrapped cars. Commercial refuse is   
 collected separately and there is also
 a skip hire service. Streets and      
 public toilets are cleaned regularly. 
 The Liason Section organises visits   
 and talks for interested groups.      </content>
