 Children's teeth are healthier these  
 days. The number of extractions       
 dropped dramatically with the         
 introduction of fluoride.             
 Poor hygiene, bad diet and sugar foods
 are the main causes of rotten teeth.  
 Plastic fillings seem to be successful
 but they have yet to be proved.       
 Eight dentists practises in Dursley,  
 working eight hours a day. Between 18 
 and 25 patients are treated daily.    
 The assistant's task is to prepare    
 surgery, sterilise the equipment, make
 appointments, file X-rays, write up   
 reports and lock-up harmful items at  
 the end of the day.                   
 Colgate or Crest are recommended as   
 best toothpastes.
