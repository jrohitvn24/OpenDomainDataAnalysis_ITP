		<content> Here are two reports by 11 year old   
 club members on types of Recreation   
 to be found at the Leisure Centre.    
     "I play squash.There are 4 squash 
 courts and it costs Â£1.50 for a 40    
 minute court.There is a squash ladder.
 If no one is booked after you, you    
 may play on.The lights do not go off.I
 play on Sunday mornings against Grant,
 Stephen or Dad."                      
     "S.O.A.K.meet on Thursday night at
 7pm.It is 50p for 15 min. in a canoe  
 plus an hour swimming at the side     
 which is a bit boring.It is Â£3 to join
 but you can still canoe without       
 membership.You have to join to take   
 the Star Tests.There is the One Star  
 Award,the Two Star Award,and the Three
 Star Award.In the pool you practise   
 Eskimo rolling, capsize drill, slap   
 supports, hip flips,and forward and   
 backward rowing."                     </content>
