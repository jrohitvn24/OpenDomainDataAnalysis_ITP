 community and is used by young and    
 old, Brownies, Guides, Cubs, Scouts,  
 Playgroup, Youth Club, Women's        
 Institute, Age Concern to name but a  
 few.  It is booked every night in the 
 week.                                 
 The surrounding Playing Fields are    
 used regularly by the Cricket and     
 Football Clubs and many of the other  
 groups have their own sports days.    
 Annually, there is a Mini-Marathon    
 which attracts people from all over   
 the County.                           
 The hall is also used for markets,    
 jumble sales, dances, the annual      
 flower and vegetable show, whist      
 drives, etc.  The Youth Club put on an
 annual pantomime or review.  Many of  
 these events raise a considerable     
 amount of money for local charities.
