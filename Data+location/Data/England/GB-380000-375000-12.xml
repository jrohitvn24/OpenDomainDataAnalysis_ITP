		<title>12DAVID LEWIS CENTRE cont.</title>
		<content>    Some stay at the centre all their  
 lives, others go home for holidays    
 eg. Christmas. Some live in hostel    
 houses and are self sufficient. The   
 residents are encouraged to be        
 occupied and some have jobs outside   
 but, with the current unemployment    
 situation,this is becoming            
 increasingly difficult.               
    There is a clinical unit with a    
 casualty service as the residents     
 often fall over. There are dental and 
 chiropody facilities.                 
    Some residents don't want to go on 
 outings, but many go to such places as
 Chester Zoo and Alton Towers. They are
 also encouraged to have hobbies eg.   
 model railways, billiards and sewing. 
    Many residents have regular        
 visitors and volunteers visit those   
 who are forgotten by relatives.
