		<content> In our area there are churches of many
 denominations e.g.Roman Catholic,     
 Salvation Army,Jehovah's Witnesses and
 Anglican.St.Margarets church in       
 Tanfield Village which is an Anglican 
 church is the fourth oldest church in 
 Durham.The church was built in the    
 year 900 a.d. and supposedly was      
 found by an anonymous monk from       
 Chester-Le-Street.The man that we     
 collected this information from has   
 been a vicar for only 6 months in     
 St.Margarets.So far he has held 14    
 baptisms,3 weddings and 8 funerals.The
 oldest gravestone was set there in    
 1650 and St.Cuthbert's body was       
 supposed to have disappeared here.The 
 church has 8 bells and the oldest was 
 constructed in 1920 just 2 years after
 the first World War.About 30 people   
 take communion at St.Margarets every  
 week.                                 </content>
