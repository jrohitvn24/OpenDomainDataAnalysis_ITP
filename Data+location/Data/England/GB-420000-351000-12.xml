		<content> There are{two covered reservoirs}in   
 the area, a small one about 1 1/2     
 kilometres S.S.E. of Bradbourne, and a
 larger reservoir near the B5035       
 Wirksworth/Ashbourne Road.            
 The latter is known as HOGNASTON      
 RESERVOIR.                            
 This is a square shaped tank with     
 re-inforced base and walls made of    
 concrete. The{water tank,}which is    
 covered to prevent contamination, has 
 a capacity of {150,000}galls. and is  
 on high ground in order to gravity    
 feed potable,treated water to local   
 places. The Severn Trent Water        
 Authority is proposing to extend the  
 outflow capacity of this tank, which  
 is a common type in the area . The    
 earth, dug out to construct the tank  
 was mounded up the sides to provide   
 insulation.  It is supplied from the  
 covered reservoir at Wirksworth.      </content>
