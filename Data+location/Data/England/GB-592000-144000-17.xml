		<title>17PLUCKLEY GHOSTS 6</title>
		<content>{THE MILLER'S}ghost can be seen among  
 the foundations of the ruined mill.   
 The Pluckley windmill was a tall      
 lapped wood constructure with louvred 
 sails which was struck by lightning in
 1939 and destroyed. Nothing is known  
 about the ghost and none of the mill's
 owners met unfortunate deaths.        
{THE COACH AND HORSES }tends to conjure
 up pictures of a traditional stage    
 coach drawn by horses careering along 
 country lanes at speed. Pluckley's    
 phantom has never been described in   
 any detail. Some are two wheeled      
 vehicles, others four. Sometimes the  
 horses are galloping or even headless.
 There may be more than one phantom    
 coach and horses.
