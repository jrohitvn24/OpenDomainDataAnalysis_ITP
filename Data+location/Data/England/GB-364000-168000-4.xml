		<title>04Legend of Saint Keyna.</title>
		<content>   St. Keyna was a beautiful 5th       
 Century British princess. She left her
 father's court in Wales and came to   
 England. She came to Keynsham and     
 decided that she would stay. She found
 out from a person who lived in the    
 village that there were serpents in   
 the village. Each serpent she saw she 
 turned into stone.                    
   Local people used to think that the 
 coiled-up shapes found in rocks were  
 the remains of the serpents. In fact  
 they are the fossilised remains of    
 ammonites, creatures which lived in   
 the sea about 50 million years ago.   
 The fossils were often used for       
 decoration in the walls of houses in  
 Keynsham. Some people claim that      
 Keynsham takes its name from the      
 legend of St. Keyna.
