		<title>17LOCAL CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>   May Fayre: This custom was revived  
 about five years ago in Elham. It     
 takes place in The Square,where there 
 are gaily decorated stalls selling a  
 variety of things. Local children     
 dance around the May-Pole and perform 
 sword-dancing.                        
   A very old custom that has been in  
 existance for hundreds of years,is    
 the Elham Bread Charity. A Jonas Warly
 born in Elham in 1640 left the sum    
 of Â£50, in his will, to provide bread 
 for six poor widows of Elham. In 1984 
 the children of Elham school dressed  
 as poor widows and re-enacted the     
 bread charity.They went to the church 
 and after the service received bread  
 from the vicar, Mr. Pitt.             
   Lyminge sometimes has a Fun Day with
 games, competitions and races.        
                                       
                                       </content>
