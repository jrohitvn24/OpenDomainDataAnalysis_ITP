		<title>01Hills &amp; Dales, Staintondale</title>
		<content> This block is within the North        
 Yorkshire Moors National Park which is
 renownes for its scenic beauty. Mainly
 grassland and some arable farmland,   
 natural mixed woodland and conifer    
 plantations. Hills and dales and      
 coastal cliffs. Streams running to the
 sea through wooded ravines. Usual     
 wildlife plus badgers and roe deer.   
 The people who live and work here are 
 mostly farmers. One farm open to the  
 public as country museum, also shire  
 horses, harness &amp; working implements. 
 Some farms take holidaymakers as      
 paying guests. Hounds of Staintondale 
 Hunt kept in village. Part of         
 "Cleveland Way" long distance footpath
 follows coastline. Scenic footpath    
 created from track of old railway. The
 spectacular views attract summer      
 visitors but otherwise a quiet and    
 close knit community.                 </content>
