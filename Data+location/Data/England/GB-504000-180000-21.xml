<title>21St Laurence Cowley church</title>
<content>

St Laurence Cowley is a liberal catholic Anglican church in Cowley near Uxbridge. It serves a mixed population of local residents and Brunel University students. &lt;br />&lt;br />On all Sunday mornings except the third in the month there are three church services. The 8am uses the Book of Common Prayer, the 9.15am is a sung communion service and the 11am is a more informal family service. On the third Sunday the 9.15am and the 11am combine to form a 10am service.&lt;br />&lt;br />The church has recently introduced a new form of worship in the Church Hall once a month. It is called Messy Church and is an arts and crafts based service. St Laurence's follows the Anglican ideal of being there to serve all the community regardless of their religious affiliation. It operates several community social clubs for this reason. The church school in Worcester Road is also open to people from all faith backgrounds.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 2011 social media is becoming more and more important. St Laurence's makes active use of the Internet to reach out to people.   &lt;br />
