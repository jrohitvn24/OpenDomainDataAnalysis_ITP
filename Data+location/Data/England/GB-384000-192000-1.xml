 The area around the village of        
 Beverstone is sparsely populated.The  
 main village is Beverstone and        
 although it contains an ancient castle
 and church there are no shops,schools 
 or public houses.                     
        In the south of the area is the
 tiny hamlet of Hookshouse.The housing 
 outside these two settlements consists
 almost entirely of large,prosperous   
 farmhouses.                           
        The countryside is attractive  
 rolling farmland with large fields    
 interspersed with patches of deciduous
 and coniferous woodland.The only sign 
 of non-agricultural activity in the   
 area is the remains of a wartime      
 airfield.                             
        The only main road in the area 
 -the A.4153 links the A.46 with the   
 local centre of Tetbury.              </content>
