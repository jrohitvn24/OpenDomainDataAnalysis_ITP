		<title>03Granite quarrying, St Mary 2</title>
		<content> The quarry is composed of granite.    
 Blasting happens once a week which    
 means they are left with very large   
 lumps of stone.  These are broken up  
 by a big ball on a crane.  They then  
 load it into large trucks which drop  
 the granite into the primary crusher. 
 This then results in pieces of granite
 or rock about 4-10 inches across.     
 These are then fed into a secondary   
 crusher producing finer granite.  All 
 men start at 8 am and each goes about 
 his separate job.  Ready mixed        
 concrete is carried all over the      
 island.  Concrete slabs are used for  
 patios.  Concrete blocks come in many 
 sizes, the main selling one being     
 4x9x18 inches.  Lightweight blocks are
 made of pumice from Italy.  All kinds 
 of granite products are made.  A      
 laboratory deals with concrete mixes  
 and design.                           </content>
