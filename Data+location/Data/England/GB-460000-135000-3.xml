		<title>03FARMING IN ARMSWORTH</title>
		<content> Farming in the Armsworth Valley.      
 Entering the valley one finds farmland
 on either side of the road, with high 
 ancient hedges and a wide verge.      
 Fields of winter wheat and two large  
 fields of grass grown for seed.Further
 up barley and more wheat.  By Lanham  
 Farm a large herd of cross bred cows  
 and their calves graze old permanent  
 pasture under the watchful eye of a   
 Charollais bull.                      
 After the turning to Godsfield some   
 farmworkers cottages lie back from the
 road. One pair has been converted into
 a private house.                      
 Opposite is Lower Lanham Copse part of
 which is copsed every winter.         
 Further up on either side more wheat, 
 some barley and an occasional field of
 oil seed rape, vining peas, broadbeans
 and a field of oats. Some calves      
 bought for beef and reared in barns.  </content>
