		<content> The surrounding landscape is an hist- 
 orical document. Farming has its roots
 in the Anglo-Saxon settlements and the
 Normans established the concept of    
 large rural estates, tenancy farming  
 and the rural village society. The    
 socio-economic structure of this area 
 was built on farming and today it is  
 still the principle industry. It is   
 now highly mechanised and the need for
 increased efficiency and profitability
 has greatly reduced the demand for    
 labour. Many small holdings have been 
 incorporated into larger units and,   
 except for Langham Park Farm, the     
 farms on the Bourne Estate are farmed 
 as one. A few small farms remain, some
 owned, some rented, but all less than 
 200 acres. Management of trees has    
 improved and a replanting scheme begun
 in the 1950s continues, mainly hard-  
 wood, conifer and chestnut coppice.   </content>
