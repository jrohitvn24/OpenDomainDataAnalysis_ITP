		<content> First of all we have {Maths} and at   
 half past ten we have middle playtime 
 and I have a biscuit. Middle play     
 finishes at a quarter to eleven.      
 After play we usually do {English}    
 work. At 11.50 we pack up and put away
 the tables and chairs. We go to the   
 toilet and wash our hands. Then I go  
 to the library and sit down on the    
 carpet and we practice our times table
 with our teacher.                     
 At twelve o' clock we lead into the   
 top classroom and have our dinner. I  
 have sandwiches and a cake. I have a  
 yogurt or something else afterwards.  
 Playtime finishes at one o' clock and 
 we go downstairs to the spare room and
 sing some{songs.}We go to the top room
 and do activities like drawing,       
 colouring, crayoning, painting and    
 colage.
