		<title>16CLOSURE OF PUMPING STATION</title>
		<content>  At Drellingore on the B2060 stood a  
 Victorian two storey pumping station. 
 It was demolished in October 1981 to  
 the annoyance of local industrial     
 archaeologists. The building was said 
 to be one of the finest examples of   
 industrial architecture in the area.  
 Dover Transport Museum Society tried  
 to lease the building to display      
 steam and petrol driven engines but   
 the Folkestone and District Water     
 Company rejected the idea due to fears
 that water wells underneath would     
 become polluted. A modern pumping     
 station has been built nearby and a   
 new reservoir tank erected at         
 Chalksole. Drellingore is the source  
 of the River Dour which flows through 
 Dover and legend has it that when the 
 "woe-waters" of Drellingore flood     
 Alkhams cricket pitch as in 20/01/67  
 a national disaster will occur.       </content>
