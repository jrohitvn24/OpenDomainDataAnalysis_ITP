		<title>07ST MARY MAGDALENE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   St. Mary Magdalene is the parish    
 church of East Ham. It was built by   
 the Normans about 1130, as a church,  
 and is the only Norman building n the 
 London Postal District still used as  
 such. Reverend J>Fellows is kept very 
 busy performing Christenings, weddings
 and regular services.                 
   Most of the building is the original
 Norman structure, but some parts have 
 been added. The tower was built during
 the Tudor period and the vestry in    
 more modern times.                    
   Inside, there are two Norman windows
 and the roof of the apse has the      
 original wooden supports, held in     
 place with wooden pegs, not nails. You
 can also see a window to an           
 anchorite's cell in the north         
 wall-here a man or woman would live   
 completely alone through their own    
 choice.                               </content>
