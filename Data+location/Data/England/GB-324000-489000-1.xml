		<title>01Blawith Fell &amp; Woodland</title>
		<content> This block contains 2 contrasting     
 sections. The eastern half is mainly  
 hilly, rocky moorland. The slopes of  
 the hills are covered with bracken,   
 gorse &amp; heather. The lower lying areas
 are wetland &amp; sheep may be found      
 grazing throughout. When viewed from  
 the summit of Blawith Fell (highest   
 point in block) in mid October, the   
 moorland looks a mass of greens,      
 browns, purples &amp; greys. South of     
 Blawith Fell, Beacon Tarn breaks up   
 the monotony of the hills. It is an   
 area popular with walkers &amp; the       
 Cumbria Way footpath passes by Beacon 
 Tarn &amp; crosses the summit of Blawith  
 Fell. The western half of the block is
 mainly rough grazing land, but there  
 is also a considerable amount of wood-
 land. The main occupation appears to  
 be dairy farming. The only public     
 transport in the area is a twice daily</content>
