  The colony survived and settled in   
what is now Jamestown in Virginia. So  
it is not, as is generally believed,   
true that the American nation had its  
roots with the Pilgrim Fathers, a group
of devout refugees fleeing religious   
and political persecution in 1620.     
Rather it began with a group of farmers
and tradesmen from Norfolk and Suffolk.
  In 1985 the voyage of re-enactment   
began. The current Godspeed is only 68 
ft long. At the waterline she is 48ft  
with a beam of 14ft8ins, hardly room   
for the 40-50 people who would have    
sailed in the original ship.           
  After encountering a few problems en-
route, mainly with weather conditions, 
the Godspeed safely achieved its       
objective. Proving without doubt that  
such a voyage was indeed possible.
