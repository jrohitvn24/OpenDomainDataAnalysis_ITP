<title>17Five Lamps Thornaby-on-Tees</title>
<content>

The location of the five lamps is no longer at Westbury Street. They are now located at Mitchell Avenue opposite The Roundel Public House, at the junction of Mitchell Avenue with AcklamRoad, just be fore the traffic lights. There is a certain amount of dissent from the residents of Thornaby, as to whether this is an appropriate place for them to be situated. So they could be moved again in the future!   &lt;br />
