		<title>11SCHOOL AND RELIGION</title>
		<content>                                       
 Ours is a very mixed school. We have  
 white children, most of them born in  
 West Drayton and Asians who were also 
 born in this country. This means that 
 we have many religious beliefs in the 
 school. When we asked the children    
 which church they belonged to we found
 that we had Catholic, Church of       
 England, Baptist, Methodist, Sikhs,   
 Muslims, Hindi and many who did not   
 know. This mixture gives us some very 
 interesting assemblies because we do  
 not always have stories from the      
 Christian Bible. We celebrated the    
{Festival of Light}and learned a lot   
 about the Indian Gods. We find that   
 all the religions teach the same kind 
 of thing, to be kind and caring to    
 each other. It is only the ceremonies 
 that are so very different.
