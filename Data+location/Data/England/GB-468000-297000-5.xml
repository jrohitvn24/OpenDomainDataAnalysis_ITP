		<content> The village has a hall at which       
 various social activities take place. 
 The Women's Institute hold its monthly
 meetings there.  There are also adult 
 education classes occasionally, such  
 as dressmaking.  Whist drives are a   
 regular feature.  People may hire the 
 hall for their own use, i.e. birthday 
 parites, ramblers refreshment centre, 
 etc.  A charge is levied for these    
 hirings.  The hall now boasts a fully 
 equipped kitchen and toilet           
 facilities.                           
 Illston has its own Parish Council and
 local people discuss matters affecting
 the village and its surroundings.  Mr.
 Jack Nourish is the present Chairman. 
 There is a small area set aside in the
 village which has swings for the      
 children to play.
