		<title>08The Occult in The Shelsleys</title>
		<content>   Many supernatural events take place 
 in the Teme Valley. In the principal  
 house in the area,{The Court House},  
 an older occupant, Lady Lightfoot, was
 imprisoned by her husband and subse-  
 quently murdered by him. Her ghost has
 been seen to drive a coach and four   
 around the landing, down into the hall
 and into the lake behind the house.   
  {Witchery Hole}, situated above the  
 river on the hillside, is said to be  
 the place where witches were burned in
 mediaeval times and there is a spot   
 where nothing can be grown.           
   In what is now called{Westmill      
{Cottage}, a ghostly presence is often 
 felt, usually by strangers. It is said
 to be a friendly woman and there is   
 one door in the house that cannot be  
 closed despite locks and bolts. This  
 cottage is situated directly below    
 Witchery Hole.                        </content>
