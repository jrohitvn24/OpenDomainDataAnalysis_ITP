		<title>13Grace Swan Memorial Hospital</title>
		<content>     The 'Grace Swan' was opened in    
 l902 from funds raised as a memorial  
 to Mrs. Grace Swan of Sausthorpe Hall,
 near Spilsby. A later extension to the
 hospital was added in l930 by         
 J.W.Ramsden Esq. in memory of his     
 father.                               
     Changes in treatment techniques   
 in past years has meant that the      
 maternity ward and the operating      
 theatre has closed down. Work has now 
 been completed to convert the         
 operating suite into extra ward space 
 and a patient's sitting room.         
     The hospital treats minor injuries
 such as cuts, bruises, small burns,   
 insect bites and allergies. There are 
 20 nurses and 5 domestic staff plus   
 the doctors which go there to treat   
 the patents.                          
     The hospital has various problems 
 such as large heating bills etc.      </content>
