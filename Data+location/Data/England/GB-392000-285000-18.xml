		<content> People in our area sometimes go to    
 church, the most active churches seem 
 to be the Methodist, Catholic and the 
 Church of England.  Many people claim 
 to have a religion but few of them    
 attend services except at festival    
 time.  People do get married in their 
 churches but do not always attend     
 afterwards.                           
 There is a Chatholic school in our    
 area and many churches run Sunday     
 School, all of the traditional        
 religions are represented including a 
 small temple and a Salvation Army     
 meeting house.                        
 People enjoy the religious occasions  
 of Christmas and Easter but do not    
 always remember the impliations of    
 them.                                 
 The ethnic minority religions are     
 represented but their places of       
 worship fall outside our area.        </content>
