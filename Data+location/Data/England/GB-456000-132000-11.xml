		<title>11ALRESFORD TOURISM</title>
		<content>    Alresford with its river walks     
 along the Arle and good trout fishing,
 is a picturesque country town. The    
 Watercress Railway, reopened, in 1977 
 revives memories of steam.            
    The Fulling Mill is a delightful 15
 Century thatched and half timbered    
 cottage.It stradles the river and was 
 built when the wool trade in the area 
 was important. The water was used in  
 'fulling', a complicated procedure to 
 clean wool, in which Fuller's earth   
 was used.                             
    At the bottom of Broad street is an
 old Inn, The Globe, behind which is a 
 large expanse of water. This lake was 
 originally caused by the work of      
 Bishop de Lucy in 1190, he had the    
 river dammed at this point. It is now 
 a haven for wildlife.                 
    The Studio Bookshop in Broad street
 has guides and walks around the town. </content>
