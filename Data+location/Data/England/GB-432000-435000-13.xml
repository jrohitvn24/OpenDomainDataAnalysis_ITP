		<content> For the Chinese and some of the       
 Vietnamese February is the time of the
 year for celebrations as their New    
 Year falls at this time.  The         
 celebrations usually begin on the 13th
 day of the month when the family      
 gather for a special meal, the        
 visiting of friends and relatives and 
 the exchanging of gifts of money, food
 and other presents normally occurs.   
 Children often receive their presents 
 in the form of money in red envelopes.
 For Hindus the time of celebration is 
 September or early October when the   
 hall of a local school is given over  
 to music and dancing around a central 
 display that depicts religious events.
 It lasts from early evening till      
 midnight. 10 days of celebrating take 
 place with all the family involved.   
 Shoes have to be taken off before     
 entering the hall.                    </content>
