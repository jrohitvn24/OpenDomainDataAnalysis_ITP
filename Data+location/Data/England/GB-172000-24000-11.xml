   Many of the farmhouses and buildings
 are old and traditional, some are very
 modern in design with milking parlours
 and intensive pig feeding etc. There  
 are very pretty thatched cottages at  
 Helford and  a small Anglican church  
 no longer in use. Manaccan Chapel     
 built 1867, the original was built    
 1835.                                 
   Landscape consists of fields, woods 
 and river and the small village of    
 Helford.  Generally very pleasant and 
 unspoilt.
