		<title>12HOME LIFE: POYNTINGTON (1)</title>
		<content>{Four social groups}can be identified  
 in this rural area: Farming people,   
 the Retired, Professional/Craft, Self-
 employed and a few Commuters.{Farms   
 are organised on a family basis with  
 only limited outside employees. Most  
 farmers own horses, dogs &amp; poultry    
 which tie them to a home base. Hunting
 with the Blackmore &amp; Sparkford Vale   
 Foxhounds, Point-to-Point races, Gym- 
 kanas, Pony Clubs, Young Farmers      
 Clubs, &amp; associated social gatherings 
 are{important events}in home life     
 which are also shared by non-farming  
 folk.{The church}still remains a focal
 point in a village like Poynington    
 even though not all parishoners are   
 worshippers. They like to know it's   
 there and most will help with finance 
 for maintenance of the building if    
 nothing else.
