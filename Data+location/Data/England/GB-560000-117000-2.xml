		<title>02Local History, Warbleton</title>
		<content> In lO86 Warbleton had land for two    
 ploughs, and since the Conquest had   
 fallen in value by one half. The      
 church dates back to the l3C.Meso-    
 lithic and Neolithic/Bronze-Age sites 
 have been found along the rivers and  
 from early times iron was worked      
 in bloomeries.In the mid-l6C improved 
 methods of iron working were imported 
 from the Continent. Warbleton had a   
 strong Dissenting tradition, which in 
 the late l6C led to the use of such   
 baptismal names as Bethankful, and    
 after the Restoration the Quakers had 
 a graveyard (now lost) to the north of
 Rushlake Green. After the decline of  
 the iron industry in the l7C, agri-   
 culture was carried on chiefly by     
 small yeoman farmers. After the       
 Napoleonic wars, many of the small    
 farms were swallowed up by the two    
 richest landowners-the Darbys &amp; Dunns.</content>
