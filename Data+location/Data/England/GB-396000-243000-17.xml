		<title>17Religion in the Villages</title>
		<content> The only church buildings in each     
 village belong to the{Church of       
{England}but some residents worship in 
 other churches and there is, at least 
 one family belonging to another world 
 faith.Our Vicar says "A remarkably    
 fine{Saxon Crosshead}witnesses to the 
 presence of{Christian faith}in        
{Cropthorne}long before the original   
 Domesday,"This parish,smaller now than
 it used to be,still has a parish      
 priest which it shares with Charlton, 
 though he no longer possesses the     
 freehold.He and the Parochial Church  
 Council care for an ancient building  
 with a Norman nave.Often congregations
 are small but above national average. 
 The P.C.C.is concerned,not only to    
 continue the tradition of faith,but   
 also with wider issues as varied as   
 unemployment in this country and      
 deprivation in the third world.       </content>
