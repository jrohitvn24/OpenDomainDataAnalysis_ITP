		<content> Some of the products that they sell   
 are BOLD, BOUNCE, ARIEL, CAMAY and    
 CREST.                                
                                       
 The car park of Procter and Gamble is 
 watched by a security camera. There is
 also very strict security about going 
 into the offices. We had to get a     
 special badge before we could go      
 inside.                               
                                       
 The working day is eight hours and 50%
 of the staff are women.               
                                       
 Underneath the building there is a    
 boiler room. On the first floor there 
 are directors' offices and also the   
 board room where the directors make   
 important decisions.
