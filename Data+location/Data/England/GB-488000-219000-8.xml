		<title>08Living in Mentmore</title>
		<content> Mentmore is an attractive well-kept   
 village, with many mature trees and   
 shrubberies. Within its population of 
 about 200 can be found{a variety of   
{occupations,}including 2 airline      
 pilots,a banker,an R.S.P.B. official, 
 someone in advertising and a staff    
 member of the{Tring Natural History   
{Museum,}some of whom commute from     
 nearby Cheddington station. A fete is 
 held yearly on the Green, with a Barn 
 Dance in a marquee, and a children's  
 Christmas party in the Hall, all      
 organised by the young married couples
 in the village. There are still four  
 estate pensioners, allowed to occupy  
 their cottages for life. Oddly, most  
 of the children are boys, who belong  
 to Cheddington Youth Club and Scout   
 group. They are taken by bus to Wing  
 schools, or at parents' expense to the
 smaller Marswoth school by car.       </content>
