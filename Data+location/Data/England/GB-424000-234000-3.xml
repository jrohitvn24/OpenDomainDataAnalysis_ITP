		<title>03Population of the Wolfords</title>
		<content> The distribution of population in     
 Great Wolford and Todenham shows a    
 similar pattern. About 50% are of     
 working age and 25% each below 16 and 
 above retirement age. The pattern is  
 slightly different in Little Wolford -
 66% of working age, 23% under 16 and  
 11% over 60. The villages are becoming
 popular as places of retirement, with 
 an increasingly elderly population -  
 Todenham has 13 above 75 years old out
 of a total of 173. On the other hand, 
 there has been a welcome increase in  
 the number of children in Great       
 Wolford recently - now 30, including  
 one set of Quads, making 9 children   
 under five out of a total of 145.     
 Little Wolford, with a total of 91,   
 has 3 under 5. Another feature is the 
 changing population. In Great Wolford 
 over half the households have lived   
 there for less than 10 years.         </content>
