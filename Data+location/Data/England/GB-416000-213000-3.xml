		<title>03GHOSTS OF SHERBORNE HOUSE</title>
		<content>  Like many old buildings, Sherborne   
 House (a 17th century mansion), has   
 many tales of ghosts but few of them  
 can be believed.                      
                                       
     The Grey Lady is an elusive ghost.
 She likes wandering around the house  
 undisturbed.Only one person has ever  
 seen her,but he was so scared they    
 never got a proper description of her.
                                       
     The ghost of 'Crump Dutton' roams 
 the upper floors of the house.When he 
 was alive he was a compulsive gambler.
 Once his butler had to drag him       
 screaming from the room after he      
 staked the house on another game of   
 cards.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
