In the Horsecroft we make drays,       
We play Hide-and-seek.                 
In the Summer it is long,              
In the Winter it is short,             
So it is good.                         
I made a dray,used five bales,         
It was huge I could fit five people in.
It had some cars,a gun and a toy CB,   
That's the joy of living in the country
