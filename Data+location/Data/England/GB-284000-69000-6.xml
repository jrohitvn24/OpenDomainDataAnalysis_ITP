		<content> The Newton Abbot area is lucky in the 
 different sorts of transport systems  
 that it has in or near it.We are close
 to the{M5 motorway}to travel north and
 have a good road south to Plymouth.   
{National coach services}run through   
 the town to all parts of the country. 
 There is a main line{British Rail     
 station in the town with services to  
 all parts of the country. The nearest 
{airports}are Exeter and Plymouth with 
 good services to foreign countries.   
 Plymouth, 3O miles away has a{cross   
{channel service.}In Newton Abbot the  
 traffic is a constant problem.Recently
 a new traffic system was introduced   
 but most people think it has made     
 traffic jams worse, not better and at 
 peak times there are long queues of   
 vehicles trying to get through the    
 town and it makes people angry. On    
 Summer Saturdays jams miles long form.</content>
