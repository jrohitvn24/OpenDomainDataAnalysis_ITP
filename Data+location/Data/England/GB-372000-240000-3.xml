		<title>03Colwall Shopping Facilities</title>
		<content> Colwall - or Colwall Stone - possesses
 an excellent range of shops for a     
 village. Our survey revealed two      
 grocery shops, one of which had just  
 changed hands because the previous    
 owner had found the competition from  
 Malvern and Ledbury supermarkets too  
 much. There are two butchers' shops,  
 selling largely locally produced      
 meat. A very good chemist, two        
 hairdressing salons, two banks        
 (mornings only), a hardware store,    
 and an estate agent all offer their   
 services. The newsagent's shop is     
 owned by a Magistrate. In addition    
 there is a garage, a Post Office, and 
 a public library. The village boasts a
 residential hotel - The Park Hotel -  
 and two inns, The Crown and The Horse 
 and Jockey. Finally the village is    
 still the proud possessor of a railway
 station.                              </content>
