		<content>   Low Hesket is a small village in    
 which the old houses are mostly       
 cottages and semi-detached. They are  
 built out of local stone which is     
 sandstone. As most of the villagers   
 have lived there nearly all of their  
 lives, it is a close knit community   
 and many of the occupants are middle  
 aged. The main way of heating the     
 houses is by coal or solid fuel as the
 average age of the houses is 182      
 years. The buildings tend to be owned 
 rather than rented and the prices     
 range from Â£20,000 to Â£150,000 each.  
 Even though they are old all of the   
 houses have a telephone and hot and   
 cold water. Each person we asked was  
 satisfied with their house and said   
 the reason they like living there was 
 because Carlisle and the lakes are    
 very convenient and they prefer living
 in a rural area rather than a town.   </content>
