		<title>17Travel in Southend</title>
		<content> Transport in Southend is very good,   
 there are green buses and white buses 
 which go all over the town. It is     
 never any problem to get to your      
 destination.                          
 Also there is a very good train track 
 from Southend Central to London,      
 calling at Westcliff, Chalkwell and   
 Leigh. During the rush hour the trains
 run every few minutes, the rest of the
 time there are about two an hour.     
 Many people commute to London every   
 day from our area, about half go by   
 car and half go by train. Afast train 
 from Southend Central up to London    
 takes about 50 minutes. The railway   
 runs parallel to the old London Road, 
 which is the A13 and part of the time 
 you travel along the shore.
