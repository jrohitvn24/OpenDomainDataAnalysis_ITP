<title>21Wokingham Without:  Halls and Activities</title>
<content>

St. Sebastian's Memorial Hall was built by Howard Palmer and family and is the responsibility of Wokingham Without Parish Council.  The rear of the building was originally a Working Men's Club but is now the Howard Palmer Room and is also hired out by Wokingham Without Parish Council. &lt;br />&lt;br />Both halls are available for hire at very reasonable rates, via the Parish Office.   The premises are currently home to a variety of activities, including Women's Institute, diet and exercise, martial arts, art, crafts, dog training, Scottish dancing, theatre school, ballet and Parish Council Meetings.  It's also a great venue for private events, from parties and AGM's to wedding receptions and christenings.  &lt;br />&lt;br />St Sebastian's Memorial Hall has two stained glass windows dedicated to those who lost their lives in World War I and II.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
