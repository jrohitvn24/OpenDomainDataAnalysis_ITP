		<title>02CHANGES IN FINCHLEY</title>
		<content> In recent years there have been many  
 changes in Finchley.                  
  We now have a large Tesco supermarket
 which has replaced a shoe shop and    
 Pope's Garage.Many Japanese have come 
 to live in Finchley and they have     
 opened their own special shop called  
 the J.A.Centre.This was once Hall's   
 Brothers, a haberdashery and clothes  
 store.On the corner of Lichfield Grove
 there was a Baker's shop - this is now
 a restaurant.There was a picture      
 palace called the Bohemia on the site 
 of the Council Offices. There also    
 used to be a roller skating rink. The 
 library is now where the old Council  
 Offices stood.They were bombed in     
 1940.St.May's Church Hall is in what  
 used to be the very large Rectory     
 Garden.Private houses have also been  
 built on this area of land.
