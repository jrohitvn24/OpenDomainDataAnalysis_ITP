 noted as a landslip area,reformed as a
 tourist attraction with beautiful     
 scenery.Where the cliff has given way 
 waterfalls have formed.               
  Above there is a tea garden called   
 Rylestone Gardens.                    
  In Sandown there is Battery Gardens. 
 It is a tea garden and has access to  
 the cliff path leading down to the    
 sea.Battery Gardens were used as one  
 of the Islands defences in the war.The
 tunnels can still be seen.            
  The sand in Shanklin is golden in    
 colour with few pebbles,but in Sandown
 the beach is a browny colour and has  
 many stones.The cliffs tend to slope  
 in places through erosion. They run   
 from Shanklin through to Sandown Bay.
