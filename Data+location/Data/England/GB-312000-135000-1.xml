		<content>  This 4km x 3km area, reference       
 03120135 is dissected by the main A358
 Taunton to Minehead road, and has at  
 its centre the village of Crowcombe,  
 which is some 6 kilometres south-east 
 of Williton.                          
  It is an area of outstanding natural 
 beauty, having to the north-east the  
 gentle slopes of the Quantock Hills,  
 and to the south-west the Brendon     
 Hills.                                
  Much of the land is privately owned  
 and is part of the Trollope-Bellew    
 estate.                               
  There is an interesting mixture of   
 architectural styles ranging from the 
 15th century Church House to modern   
 day houses.
