		<content> A GROUP OF CHILDREN IN OUR CLASS WENT 
 TO PRESCOTT HOUSE TO INTERVIEW THE OLD
 PEOPLE AND ASK THEM ABOUT RECREATION  
 MOST OF THEM SPENT THEIR LEISURE TIME 
 WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG PLAYING IN       
 GARDENS ON SUNNY DAYS. SOMETIMES  THEY
 EXPLORED PLACES AND MADE CAMPS THEY   
 ALSO PLAYED MARBLES AND WHIPS AND TOPS
 KNOCK AND RUN WAS THEIR FAVOURITE     
 GAME.IT IS NOW CALLED KNOCK DOWN      
 GINGER.                               
     WE ASKED THEM IF THEY KNEW ANY    
 GAMES SPECIAL TO THE MARSH BUT NONE OF
 THEM DID  SO AS THEY WERE  NEARLY ALL 
 FROM  LONDON.                         
     WE ASKED THEM WHAT THEY THINK     
 ABOUT RECREATION TODAY AND ONE PERSON 
 SAID THERE  WERE LOTS OF CLUBS, THE   
 OVER SIXTY FIVE ON MONDAYS  AND THE   
 TUESDAY CLUB WEDNESDAY IS THE WHIST   
 DRIVE AND THURSDAY AND SATURDAY IS    
 BINGO.FRIDAY IS A TEAPARTY.           </content>
