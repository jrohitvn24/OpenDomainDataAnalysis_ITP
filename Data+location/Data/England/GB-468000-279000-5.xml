		<content>  The land in this area is flat and    
rich, ideally suited for agriculture.  
There are seven farms, six of which are
both crop, and cattle and sheep        
rearing. The other specialises in the  
 raising of Hereford bulls and exports 
them all over the world. A very large  
proportion of the land is owned by Miss
Lancaster.  She rents this land out to 
the farmers.  The main crops grown in  
this area are: oil seed rape, barley,  
wheat, winter oats and seed hay.  The  
farmers are unable to leave fields     
fallow as it is not financially viable.
The machines that seem to be common on 
all farms are:3 tractors, combine      
drill, elevator, sucker blower,        
sprayer, fertiliser spreader, spring   
time harrow, mole drainer, baler,      
furrow plough and a rotary mower. The  
most common animals found are:beef &amp;   
dairy cattle,pigs,bulls,sheep,chickens.</content>
