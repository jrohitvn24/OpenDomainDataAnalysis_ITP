		<title>02THE CASTLE.</title>
		<content> One of the most impressive buildings  
 in Wisbech is the Castle.It is to be  
 found in the centre of a Georgian     
 Crescent as a building dating from    
 1816.The Castle is the home of the    
 local Teachers Centre and much of the 
 interior has been preserved as it     
 would have been in the 19th century.  
 Recently a local theatre group        
 presented "The Merry Wives of Windsor"
 in the grounds of the Castle.         
 Why then is such a building known as  
 "The Castle"?At the time of the Norman
 Conquest Wisbech commanded a vital    
 river crossing and so William the     
 Conqueror ordered a castle to be built
 in 1087.Since then it ha been         
 destroyed by flood,dismantled,the     
 prison for Gunpowder Plotters,a       
 Bishop's Palace and a mansion before  
 becoming the Regency Villa seen today.
