 There is a lot of transport           
 nowadays.Aeroplanes are a fast and    
 important part of our travel system.  
 But now they are getting more and more
 dangerous beacause hijackers are      
 getting into planes dressed as        
 civilians and when the plane takes off
 threaten the pilots with guns to take 
 the plane to a hide out.Air ports are 
 designed for planes to stop for people
 to get on and off and then take off   
 again.Cars are a growing industry.    
 There are lots of different kinds of  
 cars,but leading makes are advertised 
 on T.V.Road accidents are now common. 
 Boats are used in many different ways.
 They are used for taking people on    
 holidays, taking trops to war, radio  
 stations in the sea, and for leisure  
 pursuits. If we didn't have transport 
 life would be very different.         </content>
