		<content>  A{Playgroup}was started in the early 
 1970's for children between the ages  
 of 2\ and school age. It is held in   
 Wivelsfield Village Hall 3 mornings a 
 week and is able to cater for around  
 20 children.                          
                                       
 The children are supervised by trained
 staff and 'mother-helpers'. The       
 children develop language, confidence 
 and independence which stands them in 
 good stead for starting school.       
                                       
 They also learn to mix with others and
 are able to paint, listen to stories  
 and join in with group activities as  
 well as playing with a variety of     
 toys, sand, water, dough etc.         
                                       
 The playgroup relies on fees and      
 fund-raising to meet its costs as it  
 receives no aid form the authorities. </content>
