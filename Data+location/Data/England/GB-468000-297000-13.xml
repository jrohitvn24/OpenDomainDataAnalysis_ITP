		<content> square and round baler, haymaking and 
 silage equipment, a combine harvester,
 two muck spreaders, a forage feeder, a
 plough and cultivator disks.          
 Conservation also plays a part in his 
 role as a farmer.  He has made and    
 looks after a duck pond and has       
 planted oak, fir and ash trees to     
 enhance the countryside on his farm.  
 He tries to use natural fertilizers   
 and ploughs in the manure and straw   
 bedding from his cows.  The soil is   
 also dressed with phosphate, potash   
 and lime.  The cultivated land is     
 worked on a 3-4 year rotation.        
 The small farm is a very interesting  
 place with so many different          
 activities but the craft of the       
 independent farmer seems to be a dying
 one.
