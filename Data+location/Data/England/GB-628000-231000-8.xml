started by the Felixstowe Railway and  
Pier Act.Its promoter was Colonel Toml-
ine.A railway line 13 miles long was c-
onstructed.This transport line went fr-
om Ipswich to Felixstowe.On 1st May    
1877 was the first passenger train and 
this was followed a month later by     
the freight trains.In 1886 the dock was
opened for trade and the first commer- 
cial vessel entered. The dock          
at this time had a tidal basin that    
was 6 acres in area with a 147ft.wide  
entrance from  Harwich harbour. A      
maltings was erected on the south side 
of the dock basin for brewing barley.  
During W.W.I Felixstowe became a base  
for destroyers &amp; minesweepers, and in  
1916 additional railway sidings were   
installed for the Royal  Navy to use.
