		<title>09THE FARNHAM ROAD, SLOUGH</title>
		<content>     The Farnham Road is the most      
 important shopping area for the       
 western half of Slough,outside the    
 town centre.  It is also used by the  
 workers on the nearby Trading Estate. 
                                       
     The hours 8.0-9.0, 12.0-2.0 and   
 4.0-6.0 are rush hours on the Farnham 
 Road, causing traffic jams and        
 problems to workers, local residents  
 and shoppers.                         
                                       
     It is hard to park a car when     
 shopping because there are not enough 
 parking spaces, then people get angry 
 because they can't park on yellow     
 lines and they have to look out for   
 traffic wardens in case they get fined
 for illegal parking.  The house owners
 get annoyed because cars are sometimes
 left in front of their houses and then
 they can't put their own cars there.  </content>
