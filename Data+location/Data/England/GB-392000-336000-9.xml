		<content>A clump of sycamore trees surmounts the
sandstone quarry opposite the Green.   
There is much dramatic potential in    
this village green setting, with its   
diversity of buildings nearby and the  
narrow winding alignment of lanes      
entering the area in cuttings or       
between steep hedgerow banks .The      
variation of mood between enclosure    
and openess and the generally unspoilt 
settlement of Fulford are great assets 
to be conserved.                       
Another bulding worthy of preservation 
is Olde House Farm.This is situated    
west of the crossroads and at present  
uncluttered by adjoining buildings.    
It is one of the most important        
buildings to conserve due to its       
archictectural qualities of fine       
timber work.It is a good example of    
pre-industrial construction using local
timber.                                </content>
