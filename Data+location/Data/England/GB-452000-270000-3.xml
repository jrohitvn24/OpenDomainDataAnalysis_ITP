		<title>03The Hunthouse Restaurant</title>
		<content>   The Hunt House is owned by Jan      
 Geggie. The Hunt House got its name   
 from the hunting  lodge. The house was
 built in 1656. On average they have 25
 people a night. On Saturdays they have
 35. The Hunt House is only open at    
 night from Tuesday to Saturday. It    
 opens from 7-15 till 10-30. They      
 change the menu every month. You have 
 the choice of four dinners and        
 desserts. The food is mostly French.  
 they have been there for nine years.  
 It took a lot of money to do the      
 buildings up. They dug out a wall and 
 found an old fireplace. They also     
 found an old back door. The windows   
 were made of stone Mulleow. It costs  
 approximately Â£12 for the set four    
 course meal. The lady was very kind to
 us. It was a very interesting house.
