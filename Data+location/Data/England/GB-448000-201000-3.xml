		<title>03 Farming-Effects-Boars Hill</title>
		<content>                                       
  Farming is the dominant feature of   
the Boars Hill area. A certain amount  
of concern is expressed about the side 
effects of various sprays and chemicals
which are used by farmers. What effects
will these have on wild life?..On      
rivers and streams? What will be the   
long term effect on the land? Constant 
research is taking place to assess the 
likely results of modern intensive     
farming. Many hedgerows have been      
destroyed in order to make more land   
available for farming. What effect will
this have on wild life? Is it likely to
produce soil erosion in the future?    
Many people are worried about these    
questions.
