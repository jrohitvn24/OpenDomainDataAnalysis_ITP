		<title>06Churches in Shipton</title>
		<content>    Shipton Oliffe church is dedicated 
 to St. Oswald and was founded at the  
 end of the eleventh or beginning of   
 the twelfth century.In 1776 the       
 parishes of Shipton Oliffe and Shipton
 Sollars were united by the Bishop of  
 Gloucester.As Shipton Oliffe grew in  
 size and importance then the church   
 there became more important than      
 the church in Shipton Sollars:St.     
 Mary's,which in the nineteenth century
 was disused.Its windows were blocked  
 up and it was used as a farm store.One
 parishioner remembers sheep racks     
 being stored in it and collecting eggs
 from the hens stray nests.In 1874 the 
 church was restored under the         
 direction of the Rector,but then it   
 fell into disrepair again until       
 1930,when it was thoroughly restored  
 and refurbished.
