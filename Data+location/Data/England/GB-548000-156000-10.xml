		<title>10EMPLOYMENT-DUNTON GREEN AREA</title>
		<content> Most industry is situated in the      
 Dunton Green &amp; Riverhead area.        
 Chipstead is a quiet place. The West  
 Kent cold storage complex,Marley(roof 
 tile manufacturers),Plasmarc(plastics 
 marketing) &amp; Hodder &amp; Stoughton       
 (publishers) are the largest employers
 from 400-600 each,except Plasmarc with
 70-80. Outside these, people work in  
 small businesses e.g. shops, public   
 houses, libraries, banks and schools. 
 We conducted a survey on employment   
 among the parents &amp; learned that most 
 D.G. parents worked locally, some     
 travelled 7-8 miles, just a few go up 
 to London. People working locally     
 walked; nearly everybody else         
 travelled by car.Most people living in
 Chipstead &amp; Otford commute to London  
 to work, mostly by rail, some by car.
