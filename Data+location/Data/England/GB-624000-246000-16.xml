		<title>16 SHEEP FARM NEAR WOODBRIDGE.</title>
		<content>                                       
Overlooking the River Deben are the 350
Acres of Hill Farm. Half of the farm   
has pastureland for 900 sheep.         
 One shepherd cares for the 350 ewes 8 
rams and 542 lambs.Most of the lambs   
were born between January and March.   
Some  times the farmer or his shepherd 
stays up all night to look after the   
baby lambs.                            
 The sheep are dipped twice a year.This
is to stop them from getting the germs 
of sheep scab in their fleece. They did
not like being dipped and the shepherd 
had to shove them into the pit, then   
the farmer pushed them under the       
disinfectant.                          
 The shepherd has two dogs to help him,
 heir names are short ones {Meg and Joe
 so that the shepherd can call         
them easily.                           
                                       </content>
