 Fears:In our survey we found that most
 people feared nuclear war.Many others 
 feared the increasing violence in     
 society today.Another worry was of    
 mass starvation as a result of crop   
 faliures and the growing              
 population.Lots of people were        
 frightened of disease,especially new  
 ones such sa AIDS. Some people thought
 that too many people took drugs which 
 was a bad thing.Hopes:Most people     
 hoped that the world would become more
 peaceful,that there would be more jobs
 for the young and that cures would be 
 found for more diseases.People hoped  
 that life would be easier for their   
 children and that they could have nice
 houses and jobs.When we asked,people  
 answered that if they wone a lot of   
 money they would improve their houses 
 and invest money in the bank.         </content>
