		<title>09The Wallops</title>
		<content> Wallop is a small village in          
 Hampshire. In old Engish "Waella"     
 means stream, and "hop" means valley. 
 Now the two villages are called Over  
 Wallop and Nether Wallop, but in the  
 past they were called Wollop Inferior 
 and Wollop Superior. Wallop Brook     
 starts in a field opposite Pound Road.
 It goes down through Over Wallop and  
 Nether Wallop, through Broughton, into
 Romsey and there it joins the River   
 Test which flows down to Southampton  
 and into the sea. Over Wallop was     
 mentioned in the Domesday Book in     
 1085.There was enough land for one    
 plough.There were two villages and    
 two farms.The villages today have     
 three churchs,three village shops, one
 petrol station, three pubs, a nursing 
 home and one post office.The rest are 
 mostly houses, some are thatched and  
 some are tiled.                       </content>
