		<title>01WETHERBY (WEST) INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> The area west of Wetherby (averaging  
 between 50-80m in height) forms the   
 eastern edge of the Pennines. The main
 rock is Millstone Grit but in the east
 there is some Magnesian Limestone -   
 from which Wetherby's notoriously hard
 water is obtained (the bore-hole is at
 Grid Reference 381495). The area has  
 been glaciated and there are several  
 glacial melt-water channels trending  
 N-S to the Wharfe Valley which was    
 once a glacial lake. Most of the area 
 is agricultural: intensively managed  
 grassland for dairying and rough      
 grazing land is dominant in the west. 
 Further east arable farming becomes   
 more important (especially barley,    
 wheat, sugar-beet and potatoes).      
    As developments continue Wetherby  
 town is expanding westwards through   
 isolated farmhouses towards the       
 villages of Sicklinghall and Linton.  </content>
