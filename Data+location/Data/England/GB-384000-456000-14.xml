		<title>14Gala Queen Attendant</title>
		<content>    It was Gala Day at last. I had been
 chosen to be one of the Gala Queen's  
 attendants. Sarah Glossop was my      
 partner on the float. Our long dresses
 were white with blue flowers on them. 
    I kept tripping up over my dress   
 but managed to get on the float. It   
 was a freezing day and we shivered.   
    Soon it was time for the procession
 to go. Going down Station Road was    
 very bumpy and I nearly fell off my   
 stool.                                
    People waved at us. We waved back. 
 Everyone clapped when we arrived at   
 the back field, and the band played.  
    The page boys bowed to the Queen   
 and we held up her train as she got   
 off the float.                        
    Then came all sorts of races and   
 fun.At night there was a disco-dance. 
 I couldn't dance very well in my long 
 dress though.                         </content>
