		<title>19THE CHURCH IN SESSAY</title>
		<content>{St. Cuthbert's,}Sessay, is Church of  
 England and is attended by most of the
 villagers, though other denominations 
 are of course represented.{Chapels}   
 used to exist at Hutton Sessay and    
 Little Hutton but they are now houses.
 The Church is linked with our Primary 
 School and the children contribute to 
 the celebration of religious festivals
 by participation in services and      
 decoration of the building.  Also a   
{Sunday Club}for 3-13 year olds meets  
 each week except the first Sunday in  
 the month when they attend Family     
 Service in the Church.  At around 13  
 years young people may progress to    
 Confirmation classes.                 
 There is also a{housegroup}in Sessay -
 the 9 or 10 members of which meet in  
 private houses to pray together and   
 try to gain through discussion a      
 better understanding of the Bible.    </content>
