		<title>14DELIVERY SERVICES OF ALKHAM</title>
		<content>  With no local shop the people in the 
 Alkham area rely heavily on the       
 services of Mr. W. Wenham, a well     
 known local figure. Officially he is  
 the milkman but his services are more 
 diverse than this. For fourteen years 
 he has delivered milk every other day 
 to 234 households, charging 15p a week
 delivery because of the scattered     
 nature of his round. He also regularly
 delivers bread, free-range eggs,      
 obtained from local farms, and cheese.
 He collects his milk from Northern    
 Dairies, Folkestone and bread is left 
 for him on the roadside in South      
 Alkham. On Friday he collects 2O      
 grocery order books from pensioners   
 in the area without cars and delivers 
 all their goods the following         
 Wednesday. He also collects and       
 delivers prescriptions and undertakes 
 gardening for several residents.      </content>
