		<content> In our four square kilometres the     
 primary land cover is housing.  Most  
 of the houses are old, the dates      
 carved on some of the houses started  
 before 1900. There is a full range of 
 house styles including terraced,      
 semi-detached and detached.  There are
 many more terraced houses than any    
 other type.  These terraced houses are
 usually found on the side of the hills
 overlooking the river Don. In the     
 village of Ickles there is one public 
 house still open, and all the rows of 
 terraced houses have been turned into 
 small factories and offices. The only 
 new buildings are the seven new blocks
 of flats at Holmes and the flats and  
 old folks centre at Masborough. Many  
 houses have been demolished and we    
 found forty four derelict houses.
