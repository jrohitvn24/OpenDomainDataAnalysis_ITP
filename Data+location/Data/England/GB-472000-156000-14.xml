		<title>14Transport - Mattingley Area.</title>
		<content> Apart from the busy Hook/Reading &amp;    
 Hartley Wintney/Reading roads which   
 cross the block, the area is mainly   
 quiet rural lanes. Transport is       
 largely{private cars}going to or from 
 work, to the shops or just travelling 
 through the area. The other main form 
 of transport is the{lorry}(the        
 Hook/Reading road being an unofficial 
 link between the M3 at Hook &amp; the M4  
 at Reading!)                          
   The nearest railway stations are at 
 Hook &amp; Winchfield (both outside the   
 block).                               
   The only{bus services}are the once a
 week 206 &amp; 333 along the Hook/Reading 
 road, operated by Hampshire Bus Co. of
 Basingstoke &amp; the 411 &amp; 412 which are 
 run hourly along the Hartley          
 Wintney/Reading Road (across Hazeley  
 Heath) by the Alder Valley Bus Co. of 
 Aldershot.                            </content>
