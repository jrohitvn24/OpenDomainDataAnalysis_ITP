		<title>12FARMING - HOLBERROW GREEN</title>
		<content> This predominantly farming area       
 produces a variety of crops, wheat,   
 barley and oats for example. Grass is 
 cut and dried and provides hay as     
 winter feed for cattle, silage is also
 made.                                 
                                       
 Amongst the animals kept are dairy    
 cattle and Hereford cross Friesians   
 which are bought at a week old and    
 sold after 18 months for the beef     
 market. The ewes kept are changed     
 every 3 years, or so and the home     
 produced lambs are sold as fat lambs  
 in summer. Sometimes one lamb is kept 
 by the farmer to stock the family     
 freezer.                              
                                       
 The popular markets for buying and    
 selling of animals are Stratford upon 
 Avon and Kidderminster, the latter    
 being the main place to buy cattle.   </content>
