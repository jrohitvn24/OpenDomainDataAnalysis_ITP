Telford and Wrekin Council began a regeneration programme for Woodside in 2004.  As part of the process a new local centre was planned with a new community and business centre.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Park Lane Centre was opened in 2006 and houses a day nursery, Surestart Children’s Centre, Woodside Family Group Project, housing trust office, youth centre, training cafÃ©, pharmacy, dental practice and meeting rooms including a community hall, practical skills room and an IT suite.&lt;br />&lt;br />Park Lane Centre is a not for profit company and a registered charity whose aims include the advancement of education, the protection of health and the relief of poverty, sickness and distress&lt;br />&lt;br />Community groups such as a knitting group, Woodside Church, indoor bowling club and tea dance club use the building on a weekly basis. Yoga, Pilates and Zumba dance classes run weekly and there are two weekly slimming groups. The Centre holds a summer and Christmas comment event, and is available for parties and family celelbrations.&lt;br />&lt;br />Telford College of Arts &amp; Technology and WEA run courses for pleasure such as drawing and painting and digital photography as well as literacy and numeracy and vocational courses such as Working In A Classroom, British Sign Language and computing.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are play sessions for children under 5 every day and a weekly baby clinic.  A play scheme for younger school age children runs weekly and throughout the school holidays.&lt;br />&lt;br />Park Lane Centre is also the base for Friends of Rough Park group which is made up of local residents and others who use the green space which runs past the edge of Woodside down to Coalbrookadale for recreational purposes and who wish to preserve and improve it to provide access for everyone.   &lt;br />
