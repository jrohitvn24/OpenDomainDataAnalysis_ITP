		<content> Tom Poole was a benefactor of the     
 village and a tanner . His tannery was
 situated behind the old village school
 in what is now called The Tanyard. It 
 has been converted into a private     
 house called 'Mill House'. Tom Poole  
 paid for the building of the old      
 village school which he gave to the   
 village in 1812. It is built from     
 local red sandstone and now houses a  
 fine library and museum. Poole's Close
 is named after him.                   
 An old building in Lime Street has    
 been a smithy for over 100 years. This
 is still a working blacksmith's.      
 Opposite is a large archway where the 
 wheelwright's shop once stood and just
 up the road is the saddlery, now      
 selling leather goods and repairing   
 saddles.
