		<content>  {All Saints Church}was built about   
 1250 in the mediaeval hamlet at       
 Waterhay.  The thirteenth century     
 chancel still stands there, but in    
 1896 the nave, porch and bell-tower   
 were moved stone by stone to stand    
 beside the school, and a new chancel  
 was built. Windows are fourteenth and 
 fifteenth century with one fragment   
 of the original glass.  The bells are 
 dated 1627 and 1729 and the third,    
 inscribed Ave Matia Gracia Plena, is  
 probably Bristol-made about 1450. Some
 of the pews are seventeenth century   
 and the old font, which was found     
 broken up and scattered, has been     
 restored.                             
  Until the late l930's the parish of  
 Ashton Keynes cum Leigh was served by 
 a vicar and curate. In l985 Leigh,    
 Ashton Keynes and Minety share one    
 clergyman.                            </content>
