		<title>15SHOTTS AMBULANCE STATION</title>
		<content> The ambulance station is situated on  
 the Benhar road.                      
 It runs 9 ambulances,manned by 18     
 drivers. In the past drivers have had 
 9 weeks training,but in future they   
 will undertake a three year course.   
 The vehicles are normally single      
 manned,but when treatment is needed   
 for patients in transit a second man  
 is available.                         
 The job is stressful,especially when  
 children are involved in accidents.   
 The men have maternity training and it
 does happen that they sometimes have  
 to assist at unscheduled arrivals.    
  Older people are more appreciative of
 the service given than the younger,and
 are less likely to make unnecessary   
 demands for ambulances.Vehicles carry 
 life support equipment and Enteronox  
 analgesic gas for relief of pain.
