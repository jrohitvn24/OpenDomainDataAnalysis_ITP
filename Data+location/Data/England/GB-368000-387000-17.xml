		<content> In Meung's neighbouring town of       
 Beaugency Angling and football clubs  
 have also had an enjoyable exchanges  
 and matches.Meung is near the heart   
 of France,lying about half-way        
 between Orleans and Blois in the      
 beautifull Loire valley.It is there-  
 fore very convenient for visits to    
 many of the great chateaux of the     
 area.Meung itself is a small market   
 town.It has a population of about     
 5,000 but is far  more of a centre    
 for surroundings villages than is     
 Lymm.The major attractions of the     
 town are its position on the Loire,   
 its old church  and its chateau which 
 date in part from the eleventh        
 century.
