		<title>12Feast Week at Cottesmore</title>
		<content> One day in July it was the first      
 day of Feast Week.In Feast Week we    
 liked the roller disco best.At nine   
 o/clock I had to phone my dad up      
 because my legs were aching.I went    
 home at ten o/clock and my friend Lucy
 came with me.Then I went straight to  
 bed.On Monday there was  bingo and Mrs
 Frere organised it in the village     
 hall. On Wednesday there was a whist  
 drive which is a game of cards.The Fun
 Run was held at our village hall and  
 we had to run round and round the     
 hall.The first person out of the      
 children was Nicola,she won a can of  
 Coke and four Marathon chocolate bars.
 Out of the grown-ups the winner was   
 Windy.He won a trophy.We have 5-a-Side
 Football and Skittles on the green    
 every night.
