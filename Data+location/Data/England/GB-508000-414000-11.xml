		<content> Our school was started in l722 when   
 Thomas Richardson left his land and   
 orchards to be sold to found a school 
 in Ulceby. No one knows where the     
 first school was but in l84O a Church 
 school was built in Church Lane and   
 this was open until a few years ago.  
 When the new school was built by      
 Humberside County Council the school  
 changed from "Aided" to "Controlled"  
 and the Thomas Richardson Trust was no
 longer needed to repair the school    
 building. The Trustees now meet every 
 year and decide on a budget for the   
 school. This year we are having a     
 hundred new hymn books. The Trustees  
 also give every child a Bible when    
 they leave the school to go to        
 Baysgarth. The school Trustees own    
 land on Carr Road which is rented out.
 All the money was in Rolls Royce but  
 was taken out and put in Unit Trust.  </content>
