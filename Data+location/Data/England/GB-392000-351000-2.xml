		<title>02Endon Well Dressing.</title>
		<content>   In the village of Endon there has   
been a Well Dressing Festival for over 
a century.It is an annual festival of  
thanksgiving held on the last weekend  
in May.A girl aged 10-11,residing in   
the parish,is chosen to be the Well    
Dressing Queen.On Saturday a service of
Thanksgiving is held at Endon Parish   
Church when the sermon deals mainly    
with the gift of water.Then the Queen  
leads a procession down to the Well,   
where the water is blessed, usually by 
a visiting Clergyman.The Queen is      
crowned in a nearby field and local    
children dance around the May Pole. A  
pole is set up in the middle of a      
circle of dancers.Each dancer holds a  
long ribbon which is fastened to the   
top of a pole.During the dance the     
children weave in and out until the    
ribbons are plaited in a beautiful     
pattern around the Maypole.            </content>
