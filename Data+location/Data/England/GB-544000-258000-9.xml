		<title>09MR EDDIE COWELL - THE MAYOR</title>
		<content> MR AND MRS COWELL HAD A BUSY DAY WHEN 
 WE SPOKE TO THEM, STARTING WITH THEIR 
 VISIT TO US.  AFTER THIS, THEY WERE   
 GOING TO THE GUILDHALL TO ENTERTAIN   
 THE CITY'S CHIEF OFFICERS.  IN THE    
 AFTERNOON THE MAYOR HAD TO PRESENT    
 LONG SERVICE AWARDS TO COUNCIL WORKERS
 AND THEN HE WAS MEETING AN M.P. FOR   
 THE OPENING OF A SMALL FIRMS CENTRE.  
 IN THE EVENING THEY WERE ATTENDING THE
 PRIMARY SCHOOLS MUSIC FESTIVAL AND    
 THEN GOING ON TO THE ADULT TRAINING   
 CENTRE FOR THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED   
 FOR A SOCIAL EVENING.  MRS COWELL WAS 
 ABLE TO GO WITH THE MAYOR TO THESE    
 FUNCTIONS AS IT WAS HER DAY OFF WORK. 
   THE MAYOR HAS TO REFUSE MANY        
 INVITATIONS, BUT HE AND THE MAYORESS  
 HAVE BEEN TO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES    
 DURING THE LAST YEAR INCLUDING        
 SCHOOLS, FACTORIES AND GARDEN PARTIES.
