        The Village Hall is next door  
 to the school and every Monday        
 afternoon mothers bring pre-school    
 children to a play-group which is held
 in the Hall.                          
             Every Tuesday evening     
 between seven p.m. and nine p.m.      
 sports facilities are provided for    
 local children by Action Van - a van  
 specially adapted to take sports      
 equipment to village communities in   
 the South Hams.                       
               On Wednesday evenings a 
 Keep Fit class is held between eight  
 and nine o'clock.                     
                 Once a month the      
 Parish Council use the Hall for a     
 meeting place.                        
               The Village Hall is also
 used for wedding receptions, barn     
 dances, discos and other functions.   </content>
