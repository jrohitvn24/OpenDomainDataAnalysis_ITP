  Longfield Hill Womens Institute is a 
 club formed fifty_five years ago and  
 has a membership of seventy_one.Ages  
 range from eighty_five down to a young
 mother who brings her four year old   
 daughter. The club meets on the second
 Thursday of every month at 1:45pm in  
 the Scout Hut, Longfield Hill, which  
 is a small community on the boundary  
 of Longfield village. It boasts a     
 village green complete with old       
 mission church building, two          
 picturesque thatched cottages, an old 
 pub which was recently modernised to  
 become a popular steak house. The     
 community is sufficiently rural to    
 have a bus service only on Fridays.   
 New Barn, one and a half miles nearer 
 Longfield has been much built up over 
 the last twenty years and provides a  
 catchment area for recruitment.       </content>
