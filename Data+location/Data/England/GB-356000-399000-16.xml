		<title>16HISTORY OF THE THREE SISTERS</title>
		<content> The three sisters is a recreational   
 area , but at one time it was a large 
 area of coal spoil.The spoil was      
 created by the three shafts of        
 Garswood Hall Colliery .Three spoil   
 heaps were created, hence             
 the name of "The Three Sisters".Each  
 spoil heap was over 150feet high and  
 contained millions of tons of coal    
 spoil. Since 1970 work has been going 
 on to transform this eyesore  into an 
 amenity area.The large spoil          
 heaps have been flattened  so         
 that today , it provides an           
 arena of some 15 acres,and includes a 
 lake and a large area of farmland.Its 
 varied uses also includes an area     
 devoted to industry.
