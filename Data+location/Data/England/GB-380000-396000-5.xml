		<content> The area has{very little}housing in   
 it, as most of the land is used for   
 industry. The housing that exists is  
 of a great variety.                   
   There are only a few{private houses 
 in this area, the rest are mostly     
{council houses.}Around the Cresent    
 there is a terrace of{Georgian houses,
 these are private houses.             
   Around Regent Road there are some   
{local flats}whoch have been converted 
 to private ownership from council     
 ownership. There are also some flats  
 which are being demolished, the       
 wasteland will probably be bought for 
 more{residential homes.               
   Along Liverpool Street the houses   
 are a mixture of old and new, there   
 are a few{maisonettes,}which are quite
 old.                                  
   At the eastern end of the area,     
 there are some{multi-storey flats.    </content>
