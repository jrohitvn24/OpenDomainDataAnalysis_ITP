		<title>15EDUCATION IN BORDON</title>
		<content> Bordon County Junior School began as  
 "The Elder Children's School", in     
 Barbados House in 1907. It was run by 
 the army which appointed and paid the 
 teachers. During the Great War the    
 school building was occupied by       
 Canadian Cavalry units and in the     
 Second World War it was used as a     
 military telephone exchange. Hampshire
 County Council took over Barbados     
 House in 1953. In September 1956 it   
 was opened as a junior school.        
   From 1959-1961 all the 8-12 year    
 olds attended Barbados House. During  
 this time the present Weyford Infants 
 School became the secondary school for
 children over 11.                     
   In September 1965 the junior school 
 moved to Chalet Hill and Barbados     
 House became the Infant's School. A   
 new infant's school was opened in     
 1981 next to the junior school.       </content>
