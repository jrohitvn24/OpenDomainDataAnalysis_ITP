		<content> Most of the{town houses}along         
 Clitheroe, Bankfoot, Chapel Terrace   
 and Fairhill View were built during   
 the{19th century}and are separate     
 houses joined together and were not   
 designed as terraces.  There are a few
 detatched and semi-detatched houses.  
 The walls are made of{sandstone}but   
 some have been painted with           
 waterproofing material in white, cream
 or pale blue and some have been       
 pebble-dashed.  The roofs are{stone   
{tiles}and the houses are either two or
 three storeys high.  The Jollybeard   
 estate of{council houses}was built    
 during the l960's.  The walls are     
{brick and the roofs tiled.} They were 
 built in stepped terraces because of  
 the sloping ground.  Potters Lane     
 contains{modern bungalows}with tiled  
 roofs and pebble-dashed walls, stone  
 being used for decoration.            </content>
