		<content> The Baptist Chapel is opposite the    
school.It was built on a piece of land 
belonging to the shop and was then only
half the present size.A gale blowing at
about 90 miles an hour one Sunday      
morning made this building unsafe as it
was so narrow.Another bit was built on 
nearly 100 years ago.This accounts for 
the double roof.                       
The church was built at the end of the 
12th.century.Rectors date back as far  
as 1320.A list hangs in the church.The 
clock dates back to 1704.The vestry,a  
loftty looking place, used to have an  
upper room where clergy that visited   
would stay and have their meals before 
there was a resident rector.There have 
bn three rectorys in the village.The   
first one stood near the road between  
the Church and the Parish Hall.The next
one built 100 years ago was where Mr.  
Harlow lived,now it is a modern house. </content>
