		<title>15Shurland Hall - Eastchurch</title>
		<content>  A feature of the{local history}is,   
 Shurland Hall, ruins of a Tudor       
{mansion}situated on the outskirts     
 of Eastchurch village. It is thought  
 that there has been some sort of      
{building}on the site since Roman      
 times. The present building was built 
 by Sir Thomas Cheyne in the sixteenth 
 century. In 1532 Henry VIIIth and his 
 wife Anne Boleyn were guests at the   
 Hall.                                 
   During the{Second World War}Shurland
 Hall was occupied by the British Army 
 when part of the rear of the building 
 was destroyed following attacks by the
 Germans in the area.                  
   The last occupier of Shurland Hall  
 was a man named Alexander Till whose  
 tomb can be seen in All Saints Church,
 Eastchurch.
