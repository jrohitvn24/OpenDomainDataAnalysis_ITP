		<title>06Interview- our Policeman</title>
		<content>Timothy and I interviewed P.C.Rampley  
our first question was"How long have   
you been with the force?"I have been   
with the the force for 18 years.I first
worked in Ballam south London,it was   
alot different compared to Bloxham.    
Around Bloxham I tackle any crime from 
murder to lost children,damage is the  
most common crime.I use the general    
purpose patrol car-the panda.I would   
like a Police Station in Bloxham but if
we have one all the other villages     
would want one.There is an accident    
blackspot outside the Warriner and that
is the only one locally.Our uniform    
could be more practical than it is.    
Crime willrise in the future in the way
population rises.In Bloxham there are a
few people who take drugs or glue sniff
because they think it gives them buzz.
