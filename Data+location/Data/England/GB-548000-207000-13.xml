		<content> S.W. corner :{500090}Vast sweeping    
 fields of oil-seed rape, wheat &amp;      
 potatoes cover most of this one square
 kilometre. Tucked away behind well-   
 grown screens of mixed timber on the  
 southern boundary lie two small       
 holdings : Thrushes Bush &amp; Little     
 Bundish. Close-by to the west lies the
 only sports ground in the block. At   
 present overgrown &amp; neglected with    
 broken goalposts; a silent testimony  
 perhaps to changing tastes &amp; interests
 of young country dwellers.THE JOHN    
 BARLEYCORN :{501092}is  popular inn   
 with a small clientele of locals and a
 major motorist trade in the evenings &amp;
 at weekends. An old building with a   
 quaint interior of beams &amp; nooks, it  
 has adapted to changing needs, the    
 cow-pond is now a lily-pond stocked   
 with fish with an inviting garden as  
 background.                           </content>
