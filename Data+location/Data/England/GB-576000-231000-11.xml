		<title>11DAIRYS IN SIBLE HEDINGHAM.</title>
		<content>    On 30th April we went to visit     
{Tanner's Dairy.}They sell milk and    
 other produce as well. It took 44     
 years to build up their business.     
    They do not have their own cows.The
 milk is collected by their fleet of   
 tankers from farms all over North     
 Essex and Suffolk. The milk goes      
 through six machines before it is     
 ready to drink. Then it is delivered  
 to other{dairy's}and people's         
 doorsteps.                            
    On 23rd April we visited{Fuller's} 
{Dairy,}where they farm 60 acres. In   
 one field we saw about 70 Jersey cows,
 some calves and chickens.They do not  
 produce or sell milk but make a wide  
 selection of{Dairy Produce}such as    
 Yoghurt,Cheese Cake and Soft Cheese.  
     Both{Dairy's} are family owned and
 run businesses.                       
                                       </content>
