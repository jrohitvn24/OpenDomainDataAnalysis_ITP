		<content> My dad is silaging .He is cutting     
 grass with a forage harvester. He is  
 leading grass which means taking it to
 the silage pit. He will be finished in
 a week. He has a barrel on the front  
 of his tractor with treacle in it.It  
 is mixed into the silage. The cows    
 love it.They put the grass in the     
 silage pit. They put a sheet over. It 
 is the cows feed for the winter and   
 when they are milking they get cow    
 cake. Then he will cut the straw and  
 then he will mow it and turn it then  
 bale it and put it in the barn.
