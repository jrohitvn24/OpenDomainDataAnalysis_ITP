		<content>   Mylor is a fairly old village that  
 has  some very old houses and some    
 very new houses. We came across one   
 very old house and the man whose      
 family had lived there.He told us that
 there was a brick factory which the   
 people of Mylor used to go,to make    
 bricks to build houses.The bricks were
 made out of mud,clay and granite.The  
 family who lived in this house were   
 the Rundells.The modern houses were   
 made of blocks and cement the         
 difference is the new houses are      
 better and stronger so they should    
 stay there longer.                    
   Many of the old cottages ,made from 
 granite, had inside wall of cobb      
 (earth).The majority of windows are   
 now made in a large shed belonging to 
 the Barnicoats. Here the window frames
 are built and the glass put in.
