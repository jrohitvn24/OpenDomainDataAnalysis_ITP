		<content> Many ativities involved both adult and
 children with parents often joing in  
 withorganisation and                  
 supervision.Swimming,football,ice     
 skating,horse riding,strawberry       
 picking,shopping and watching         
 television were among the many shared 
 activities .A sense of sharing and    
 togetherness is important to the      
 community.Solitary leisure acts       
 included playing musical              
 instruments,dancing,bird              
 watching,playing with pets for the    
 children and for adults gardening, car
 repairing,decorating their homes.     
 For sheer relaxation and interest,many
 adults preferred to meet friends and  
 neighbours in a local public house in 
 the evenings-Friday and Saturday being
 the most popular meeting days.
