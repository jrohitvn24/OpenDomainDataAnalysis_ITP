    These charities were to help the   
 poor families and widows and relief of
 this kind was an important part of the
 Church's work, long before the Welfare
 State came into operation.            
    Today the Church has few secular   
 functions - certain public notices    
 still have to be displayed on the     
 Church door - but continues to be the 
 centre of the religous life of the    
 community. Baptisms,weddings and      
 funerals all take place in the Parish 
 Church,as well as the special         
 festivals such as Plough Sunday,      
 Rogation Sunday and Harvest Festival, 
 which remind us that until quite      
 recently agriculture was the main     
 occupation of the people of Barnburgh.
