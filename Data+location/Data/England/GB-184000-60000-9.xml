		<content>{TREWOLLACK FARM}was built in 1820, but
 there has been another house built    
 there more recently. The farm is owned
 by the {DUCHY OF CORNWALL} and has the
 three feathers to represent it.  The  
 farm covers 310 acres and includes    
 beef cattle but no milking cattle.    
 They have 500 sheep with lambs which  
 are sold for meat. They have 10 acres 
 of hay and other crops, but mostly    
 grass for grazing. Also there is an   
 old mine on the farm and the shaft is 
 one of the deepest in Cornwall at 600 
 feet.  Next to the old {FAIRPARK      
{SCHOOL}which is not in use anymore,   
 there are some newly built houses.    
 These are timber framed with block    
 work that is shingled on the          
 outside.Shingling is gravel thrown    
 onto the walls as a protection from   
 the weather.
