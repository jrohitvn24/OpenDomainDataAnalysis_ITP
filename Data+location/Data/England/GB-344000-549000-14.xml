		<title>14THE ROSE QUEEN,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> The Rose queen will take place on the 
 seventh of July.We have a queen and   
 some attendants.They sit on the back  
 of a trailor which is towed by a      
 tractor.The queen sits on a chair.The 
 attendants sit on the trailor but two 
 stand on either side of the queen.When
 the tractor comes into the playing    
 field the queen is crowned and the    
 attendants get off and curtsey and the
 boys bow to the queen.When that is    
 over we have fancy dress which is     
 judged in five age groups.When the    
 fancy dress is finished we have races 
 and some stalls which sell things like
 ice cream,sweets and various other    
 things.We have quite a lot of         
 races.The prizes are money for first  
 ,second and third.We have a cross     
 country which is about two miles long.
 The first girl and boy back to        
 cotehill get a trophy.                </content>
