		<title>03THE TOTLEY TUNNEL</title>
		<content> To secure a shorter rail route        
 to Manchester, the Midland Railway    
 Company planned a new line from  Dore}
 to Chinley via the Hope Valley and    
 Edale.Work began in 1888 and required 
 a 3 mile tunnel under Totley Moor.It  
 took six years to build during which  
 there were severe problems with water.
 The coming of the railway brought many
 changes to the village of Totley.     
 Evidence of some of these can still be
 seen.They include a row of cottages to
 house the tunnel workmen and several  
 spoil heaps which are now covered by  
 silver birch trees and undergrowth.   
 The line still carries passenger and  
 freight traffic to the Manchester area
 but the Dore and Totley Station is    
 closed.
