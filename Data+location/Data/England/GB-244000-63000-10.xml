		<title>10CHILDREN IN BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   Two young lads experimenting with a 
 canoe in a little creek that filled   
 with water as the tide came in - this 
 was the scene from the green by the   
 quay at Bere Ferrers.One's first      
 impression is that this area is an    
 idyllic one to grow up in, with woods 
 and space, neighbours to know you, a  
 little shop to buy sweets and ice     
 cream plus a Recreation or "Party"    
 Field with swings and climbing frames 
 for good measure. It's a small        
 village _ perhaps there's a shortage  
 of children of just the right age and 
 Mums may have to be careful that the  
 River Tavy, with its mud flats, does  
 not come unexpectedly close to their  
 offspring.                            
   There is a Toddler's Group in the   
 village and then when they are of     
 school age they are taken by 'bus     
 either to Bere Alston or Tavistock.   </content>
