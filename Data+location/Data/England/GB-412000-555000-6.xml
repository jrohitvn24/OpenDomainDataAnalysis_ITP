		<content>    Most of the trees including Turkey 
 oak, English oak, Douglas fir,        
 Norwegian spruce, cedar, larch, yew,  
 sycamore, beech, silver birch, and    
 conifers are about 33 years old. There
 are many much older. About 60 trees   
 are felled at a time. It is not a     
 viable proposition to uproot the      
 entire tree mainly because of the cost
 and type of terrain. The roots are    
 sprayed to prevent growth of fungus.  
 Replanting takes place in spring.     
 Forestry workers find that rabbits are
 a menace, eating seedling trees and   
 stripping bark from saplings.         
    When felled, the first section of  
 the trees is known as the 'saw log'.  
 These are sent to a Durham firm and   
 used to make garden sheds and also to 
 supply the building trade.
