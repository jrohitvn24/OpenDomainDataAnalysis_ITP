		<content> The roads branching off               
 Troutbeck Avenue are Lakeland Close   
 and Ennerdale Close.The one branching 
 off Lunesdale Drive is                
 Ribblesdale Drive.Most of the houses  
 in the actual village are very nice   
 and modern,but in fact the village is 
 very old.                             
   The oldest buildings are the farms  
 which go back as far as the 17th      
 century but most of them date from the
 18th. These farms are scattered around
 Forton but the oldest houses are      
 concentrated on Hollins Lane(formerly 
 the main trunk road before the A.6),  
 Wallace lane and Cockerham Road.
