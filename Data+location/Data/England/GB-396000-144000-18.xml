		<title>18FARMING IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Only one farm exists in this area,    
 comprising 993 acres. The Department  
 of the Environment is the landlord.   
 The farm forms part of the Army       
 training ground and is split into two 
 categories; Schedule I on which the   
 tenant may farm in the normal way and 
 Schedule III which has a grazing      
 licence only and on which the Army    
 trains. The greater acreage is        
 grazing from which silage and hay are 
 taken during the summer months and on 
 which sheep from the Welsh mountains  
 are over wintered from November to    
 April. Schedule I comprises 438 acres 
 of which much is ley pasture. Crops   
 grown are barley and wheat. There is a
 seventy cow dairy, and beef bulls are 
 used to produce store cattle which are
 sold in Shaftesbury market. Five men  
 are employed on the farm.
