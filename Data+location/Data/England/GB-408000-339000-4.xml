		<content>   St.Michael's belongs to the Church  
of England.It was built in 1872 to hold
200 people but now only about 20 people
attend the services.The Rev.Fothergill 
is the vicar who says that worship     
means worth because it is worth going  
to church to pray and sing to God.There
are 7 people in the church choir and 10
people to ring the 8 bells calling     
people to worship.People have collected
money to make a special glass window in
the church.A vicar for 7 years Rev.    
Fothergill prefers happy occasions like
celebrations,christenings,confirmations
and weddings,but was embarrassed when  
at one wedding the bride-groom did not 
turn up.He does not like funerals,they 
make him sad.Part of the church is     
beginning to fall down and now needs   
instant repair.At the end of the church
drive is a Lich-gate,an old gate with a
porch over the top.                    </content>
