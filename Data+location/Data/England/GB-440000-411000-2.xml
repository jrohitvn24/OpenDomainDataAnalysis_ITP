 On Saturday I get up about 7.45am.I   
 get up this early because I have to go
 to music school.  For my breakfast I  
 have a cup of tea. I leave my house at
 8.45am.I walk to a school at the end  
 of our street and a bus comes and     
 picks me up at 9.00am. The journey is 
 about fifteen minutes.                
 When we reach Minsthorpe we get our   
 instruments out. After all the chairs 
 and stands have been set out my       
 teacher, Miss Dale,tunes all our      
 instruments, which takes about another
 fifteen minutes,then we begin to play.
 We play until 10.30am, then we have a 
 break for thirty minutes in which I   
 buy a cup of coffee, then I have a    
 walk round and go look at the horse in
 the field.
