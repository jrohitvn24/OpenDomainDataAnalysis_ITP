		<title>14FROWICK HALL</title>
		<content> Frowick Hall is a beutiful house which
 is very old in places but has had many
 improvements. The gardens are         
 landscaped and the owners very        
 pleasant and helpful people. The wife 
 showed us round the Hall and explained
 that it was a grade three listed      
 building. The land around the Hall    
 amounts to 300 acres and is used for  
 arable farming. Frowick Hall is a     
 house and is not open to the general  
 public. The farm buildings opposite   
 the road, Frowick Lane, have many     
 different machines including tractors,
 sprayers, and a very big combine      
 harvester. Also on the farm were some 
 chickens, ducks and geese near the    
 small pond and two ponies in a field  
 near the farm building.
