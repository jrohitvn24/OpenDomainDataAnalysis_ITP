		<content> The year of 1985 saw the beginning of 
 3 new developments in the village,2   
 housing projects in Stocks Lane and   
 Leigh Sinton Rd. and the renovation   
 of the old chapel also in Leigh Sinton
 Rd.Both of these roads saw an increase
 in traffic with the L/S Road becoming 
 increasingly controversial due to the 
 poor surface and the County Council's 
 inability,for various reasons,to      
 remedy the situation.The Malvern      
 Gazette became the mouthpiece for many
 letters of complaint from the local   
 action group and the Headteachers of  
 the schools whose children were       
 affected.The opening of the new bridge
 over the River Severn at Powick also  
 caused an increase in traffic along   
 Stocks Lane and comment within the    
 village.The provision of a new school 
 and its prospective location was a    
 very important issue through the year.</content>
