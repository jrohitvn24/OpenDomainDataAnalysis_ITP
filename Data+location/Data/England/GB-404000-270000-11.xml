		<title>11Changing Village</title>
		<content> many people in our survey said that   
 they did not tink that the village has
 changed much.  The biggest change is  
 the post office being closed down.    
 That was really the only shop around. 
 The earest shops are in Redditch which
 is difficult to get to if you have not
 got a car. A few more houses have been
 built around the village.  There are  
 more younger people living there.  One
 man said the younger generation never 
 join in with the events that take     
 place at the peace memorial Hall.     
 Apart from these the village is still 
 the same friendly place.
