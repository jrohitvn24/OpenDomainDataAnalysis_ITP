{CUSTOMS- LYTHE TENANTS' SUPPER}       
                                       
 This event takes place every summer,  
 either in July or August.It is        
 probably a relic of an era when all   
 the tenants came to pay the Lord their
 annual rent.                          
 Nowadays the Marquis of Normanby,the  
 owner of the Estate, has a large      
 marquee erected in the grounds of     
 Mulgrave Castle for the event.Tables  
 and chairs are provided and catering  
 arrangements are made with an outside 
 firm of caterers.All the Estate       
 Workers and Tenants are invited to a  
 supper,after which Lord Normanby      
 speaks about the progress of the      
 Estate and about proposed changes and 
 developments.
