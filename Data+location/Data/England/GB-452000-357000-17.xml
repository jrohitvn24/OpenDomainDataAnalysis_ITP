		<title>17THOMPSON'S GRAVE.</title>
		<content> Thompsons Grave is on Berry Hill Lane.
 It can't be seen cleary because it is 
 surrounded by a wall with only a gate 
 to look through.Charles Thompson was a
 businessman who spent most of his life
 abroad.                               
       Once,in Lisbon,there was a great
 earthquake.Churches were torn down and
 graves upturned revealing             
 bodies.Charles decided that he would  
 be buried 18 feet down,so he could    
 rest in peace.                        
               He returned to Mansfield
 and often walked to the highest point 
 in Mansfield.Charles left money to the
 Brunts Charity and they later erected 
 a memorial over his grave.
