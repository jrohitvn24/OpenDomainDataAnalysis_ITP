		<title>19Sand Extraction, Austerfield</title>
		<content>  The soil throughout the block is box 
 sand. It is a glacial deposit from the
 last Ice Age and occurs in a wedge    
 shaped area fanning south from        
 Doncaster to beyond Bawtry. This      
 deposit is the largest in the United  
 Kingdom and is of the best quality. It
 is used by the Black Top industry in  
 the manufacture of hot rolled asphalt 
 and also in the building of virtually 
 all local houses.                     
  The quarries are situated to the east
 of Austerfield with access on to the  
 A614 and thus heavy lorries make up a 
 large proportion of the traffic       
 through the village.The worked areas  
 are extensively colonised by wild     
 plants,including sallow trees, and    
 such animals as toads, frogs,         
 butterflies and moths.
