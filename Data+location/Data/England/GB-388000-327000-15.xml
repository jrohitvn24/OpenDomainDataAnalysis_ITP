		<title>15WHITGREAVE A LOCAL VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Types of recreational activities are  
 wide-spread,ranging from gardening to 
 aerobics,chess,fishing,squashand      
 bowls.Church going is not             
 popular:there is no resident vicar,so 
 a weekly service is taken by a        
 visiting vicar from Stafford.Half the 
 population use Credit cards.The       
 majority of houses have daily papers  
 delivered;the post reaches them       
 all.One house has wine delivered,4    
 have bread,7 have eggs and 4 have main
 order goods.                          
   Within the village ,there are three 
 farms.Two of these are mainly         
 dairy,the other is a poultry farm     
 which has an output of about 1000 eggs
 per day.Around the village,most fields
 are used for grazing,though there is a
 small amount of arable ,growing       
 wheat.barley and oilseed rape.
