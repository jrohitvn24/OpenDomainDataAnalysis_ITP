{THE TOLLGATE HOUSE}- It is opposite   
 our School and it is now a home.      
  There were only four rooms - sitting 
 room, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom.  
 You can see all that is going on      
 because the windows are on a different
 wall and there are 8 walls. The roof  
 is pointed. We went into the garden   
 and saw a duck.{PENSCOT FARMHOUSE     
{HOTEL}- In the 15th Century the nearby
 MANOR was built, with 3 cottages for  
 the workers at the{MANOR}- shepherd,  
 game keeper and steward. These 3      
 cottages today have become {PENSCOT   
{FARMHOUSE HOTEL. }We saw the Dining   
 room,the bar, the kitchens, many      
 bedrooms and the gardens. There was a 
 sunken rose garden which looked very  
 beautiful. We asked lots of           
 questions.Many people work here.
