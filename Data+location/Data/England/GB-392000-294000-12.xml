		<title>12Cannon Works</title>
		<content>Cannon is an old established factory   
that makes gas fires and cookers. The  
following is the record of an interview
with an employee.                      
"How long have you been working at     
"Cannon?"                              
"I have been working there for eleven  
years."                                
"Do you like the area of the factory   
you work in and is your job clean?"    
"Yes it is quite clean."               
"What is your job?"                    
"Pickling, which is putting the enamel 
on the cookers".                       
"Have any new workers been started at  
the Cannon recently?"                  
"Yes, about six or seven have joined." 
The employee gave us the impression    
that the Cannon is a very pleasant     
place to work. It is also a very       
important industry,and it appears to be
doing well in a time of unemployment.  </content>
