		<content> The area of Old Warden and Ickwell is 
 mainly agricultural.  Most of the     
 changes are connected with the advance
 of agriculture.                       
   The many cottages built for farm    
 labourers are now often privately     
 owned.  Indeed the nature of the      
 villages has made them most sought    
 after because of their rural charm.   
   Some local houses date back 500     
 years and there are examples of       
 thatched, wooden and brick buildings. 
   There are three very large estates  
 and families from these feature in    
 local history.                        
   Old Warden is mostly the creation of
 two families, the Ongley's and the    
 Shuttleworth's.  Today the            
 Shuttleworth Estate is home partly    
 for the Shuttleworth Collection of    
 historical aeroplanes, cars and bikes,
 and partly an agricultural college.   </content>
