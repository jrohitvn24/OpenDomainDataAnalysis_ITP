		<title>17TOWN-CENTRE HOUSING, PRESTON</title>
		<content>   As{Preston town centre}has expanded 
 the housing in our area has changed.  
 Rows of terraced houses were built for
 all the workers who came to work in   
 Preston's factories.                  
   As the original housing{deteriorated
 some of it was knocked down.Tower     
 blocks, maisonettes and low-level     
 flats were built. Old people who had  
 to leave their houses had special     
 sheltered housing built in the area.  
   Rich{Georgians and Victorians}built 
 large houses close to the River Ribble
 and parks. Many of these are now used 
 as offices.                           
   A large inter_wars estate was built 
 near the river. To keep people in the 
 town-centre{new housing}has replaced  
 some old streets. Around{Frenchwood   
{School}many houses are being{repaired.
 Many of our houses date from 1909. We 
 hope they will still be here in 2009. </content>
