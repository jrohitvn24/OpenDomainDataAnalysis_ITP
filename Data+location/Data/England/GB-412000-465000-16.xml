		<content>  In Pateley Bridge there is a computer
 software company called Microtrend    
 U.K., which is owned by a Dutch       
 company. They produce business        
 software and employ twelve people in  
 Pateley. They have been producing     
 software in their present offices for 
 two and a half years. These are in the
 Council Chambers, King Street. The    
 company are based in Pateley because  
 the first programmer for Microtrend   
 lived in the area. It is a perfect    
 place for producing business software 
 because all the necessary ingredients 
 are here. These include such things   
 as electicity, computers, peace and   
 quiet and a regular postal service.The
 software is supplied to many countries
 throughout Europe in nine different   
 languages, although most of them are  
 in English, German, French and Dutch.
