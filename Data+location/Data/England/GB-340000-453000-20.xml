		<content> Two severe storms in the last l0      
 years, causing considerable damage at 
 Sunderland Point, lead residents to   
 await anxiously the next one.  There  
 is little scope for improving the     
 protection to the village.  Any global
 change which would cause a significant
 rise in sea level would make the      
 village untenable. The new Heysham    
 nuclear power stations are about 5    
 kms. from the village. The            
 construction and operation have       
 created some employment in the        
 village, but there is a widespread    
 unease in a community so close to the 
 sea about the safety of the nuclear   
 plants and in particular the effects  
 of radioactive discharges to the sea  
 from the stations and from the        
 reprocessing plant at Sellafield.     
 Salmon fishing faces increasing       
 competition from farmed salmon.       </content>
