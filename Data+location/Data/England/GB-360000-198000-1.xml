		<content> Alvington, Glos., 100 ft above sea    
 level, is a very rural area on the    
 north bank of the Severn Estuary.     
 In 1984 the total population was 612. 
 It is a farming area, with three      
 family owned farms mainly devoted to  
 sheep and cattle.                     
 The village is old and in fact one    
 of the farms, Alvington Court, was    
 noted in the original Domesday Book.  
 Housing is mainly old, modernised     
 cottages, with one small Council      
 Estate.                               
 The main Chepstow to Gloucester road, 
 the A 48 runs through the middle of   
 the village                           
 Amenities are virtually non existant  
 and most activities and facilities    
 occur in Aylburton and Lydney         
 There is almost no employment in      
 the area and therefore people who do  
 have jobs have to commute.            </content>
