		<title>04 A Disaster</title>
		<content>  The biggest explosion in Britain     
happened in Fauld just after 11.00am on
Monday morning 27th November 1944. It  
was caused by thousands of pounds of   
bombs blowing up which were stored in  
old mine workings.They were detonated  
by accident.The Crater is 90ft deep    
and 500 yards across.It covers 12      
acres. It is dotted with big chunks of 
gypsum that have been thrown out very  
easily like small stones.There was     
once a 185 acre farm which is now a    
big hole in the countryside.Boulders   
crashed down and one 30-ton rock was   
found half a mile away.69 people were  
killed including 6 Italians,19 bodies  
were never found.Damage was done to    
buildings all around.The Memorial Hall 
was built in memory of the people      
who were killed.If you go to the       
site now you will see bushes,ponds,    
wildlife and some rare flowers.        </content>
