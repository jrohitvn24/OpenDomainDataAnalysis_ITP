		<content>{THE HINCKLEY TIMES                    
 Hinckley has its own{newspaper        
 published every Friday costing 18p.   
 The Hinckley Times concentrates on    
 local news and items of interest.     
 Often the main feature is a local     
 tragedy or an event in the area such  
 as a strike. The paper always includes
 reports on local shows, fetes, sport, 
 crime, successes and council reports. 
  Advertising is an important part of  
 the paper providing the major         
 financing of the paper.               
  The paper is produced at the offices 
 at Brunel Rd. where seven reporters   
 collect and type the news to be       
 selected by the editor.               
   The paper size is decided by the    
 amount of advertising.The manager sets
 out the adverts in page lyouts then   
 surrounds them with relevant news     
 printing 70,000 words of news.        </content>
