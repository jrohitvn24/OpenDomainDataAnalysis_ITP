		<title>09THE TOWN HALL,CONGLETON</title>
		<content> The Congleton Town Hall is a major    
 feature of the town both as an        
 Information centre and as a source of 
 many local activities. It is now      
 mainly used for social events and     
 local organisations hire the main hall
 for various functions e.g. scout fairs
 and fashion shows. Twenty years ago   
 markets were held in the Town Hall, a 
 cattle market on Tuesdays and a food  
 market on Saturdays.Courts were also  
 held at the Town Hall and police cells
 were at the rear of the building.     
 Borough council meetings are still    
 held at the hall now. The Town Hall   
 has had many improvements. It has been
 sand blasted and a new clock face     
 and wooden doors fitted. However the  
 original stone flag floors remain     
 having been reset and levelled.
