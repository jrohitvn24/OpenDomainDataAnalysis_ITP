		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ANDREW</title>
		<content>   Most days my five year old brother  
 wakes me up around seven a.m but on   
 Saturdays he lets me sleep.I awake    
 around eight forty-five a.m.I get up  
 at ten minutes past nine.I have my    
 cereal and go out.My friend is always 
 waiting for me on the green with his  
 ball.We then go over to the park and  
 kick the ball to each other.Around    
 eleven thirty a.m he tells me he wants
 his breakfast.After dinner we go for a
 bike ride mostly we bike down to      
 the{Adventure play ground}until five  
 p.m then to his bedroom to talk about 
 girls.Soon his thirteen year old      
 brother walks in and says I have just 
 had my breakfast because to my        
 friend's brother bed is the best      
 place to be on a cold day.            
  I go to bed at ten on Fridays and    
 Saturdays.                            
                                       </content>
