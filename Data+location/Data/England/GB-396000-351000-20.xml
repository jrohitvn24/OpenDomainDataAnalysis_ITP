		<content>   In common with other areas,         
 Cheddleton has felt the cold draught  
 brought about by the falling birthrate
 and economic pressures. The middle    
 school opened in 1982, is now to close
 and the children affected will have to
 travel to Leek or Cellarhead. Local   
 voices were raised in dissent but     
 there was no alternative. It seems    
 that an 'ill wind' has brought the    
 possibility of the middle school now  
 becoming the village hall, since the  
 Village Parish Institute has no car   
 park and few amenities.               
   The village has layers of opinion,  
 the old residents, nurses, and medical
 staff at the local psychiatric        
 hospital, and residents who commute to
 Leek or Stoke-on-Trent.
