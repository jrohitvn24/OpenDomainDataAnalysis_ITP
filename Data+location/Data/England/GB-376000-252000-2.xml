       Within living memory most of the
 land was covered with apple and cherry
{orchards}and{hopyards. }Indeed, the   
 1961 ordnance survey map indicates    
 that there were still large acreages  
 of fruit.  Today, however, most of the
 orchards have disappeared and the     
 hopyards are being abandoned.         
                                       
      Formerly fruit was transported by
 lorry to markets in places such as    
 Manchester and Glasgow, but now it is 
 usually sold on a{"pick_your_own"     
 basis.                                
                                       
      Most of the land is now turned   
 over to the cultivation of{wheat,     
{oats, barley}and{grassland.
