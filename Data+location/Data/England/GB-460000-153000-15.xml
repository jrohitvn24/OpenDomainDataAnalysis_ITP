		<content> Education in this area is the         
 responsibility of the Hampshire Local 
 Education Authority.  There is an Area
 Education Officer and staff based in  
 Basingstoke whose area includes all of
 North West Hampshire.  Our area       
 includes one secondary comprehensive  
 school taking pupils from 11 to 16    
 years old.  This school is called the 
 Vyne, and is an amalgamation of       
 Queen Marys Boys Grammar School and   
 Charles Chute, the boys secondary     
 modern school. There are two primary  
 schools affiliated to churches, St.   
 Bedes R.C., and Sherborne St. John    
 C.E.(Cont.). The area has two pairs of
 infant and junior schools, Merton     
 infant and junior on the Popley estate
 and Oakridge infant and junior on the 
 Oakridge estate.  There are also three
 special schools in the area.
