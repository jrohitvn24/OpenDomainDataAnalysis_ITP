		<title>17POLICE AT SLAUGHAM MANOR</title>
		<content> Slaugham Manor was built in the 19th  
 century and was changed from a Manor  
 to a hotel just after the Second World
 War.On the 26 June 1976 it became a   
 hall of residence for single policemen
 (56) and policewomen(2) who work at   
 Gatwick Airport. The Sussex County    
 Police bought it for a reasonable     
 price.Its purchase saved the rate     
 payers a lot of money.Every policeman 
 has his own room with a bed, cupboard,
 table,chair,bedlinen,bedsidelamp and  
 mirror. The policemen are allowed to  
 use the old hotel facilites e.g heated
 swimming pool, bar, ballroom where    
 parties are held ,the Silver room     
 where officers hold their meetings and
 a room where policemen train with  a  
 scale model of Gatwick Airport.The    
 ballroom has a picture showing 9      
 policemen drinking 9 pints (tea OF    
 COURSE ).                             </content>
