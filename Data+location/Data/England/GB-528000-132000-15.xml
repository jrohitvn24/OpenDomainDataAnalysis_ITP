		<title>15THE OLD HOUSE (cont.)</title>
		<content> Early this century the house was      
 called{Gibbs Old Farmhouse.}It was    
 once a farm in its own right then     
 owned by{Greentrees Farm}and later    
 owned by{Highley Manor}who modernised 
 the house. The name was shortened to  
 the Old House. Now a Sir and Lady, who
 bought the house over 20 years ago,   
 live there. They used to come from    
 London for weekends and if the central
 heating had not come on the house was 
 earthy cold as the building has no    
 proper foundations. 20 years ago the  
{High Street}was a very quiet lane but 
 now is very busy particularly during  
 the rush hour. Fir trees are being    
 planted to help protect the house. In 
 the garden are 2 sheds which were the 
 outside toilets, a manhole which      
 covers the old well, an old marl pond 
 where the clay for the plaster was dug
 out and a modern swimming pool.       </content>
