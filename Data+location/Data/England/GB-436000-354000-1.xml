		<title>01STH WINGFIELD-AREA SUMMARY</title>
		<content>                                       
 South Wingfield probably takes its    
 name from the "win" which is the      
 ancient name for common gorse.        
 It is a rural area with much of the   
 farmland being under grass. The       
 landscape is gently undulating with   
 some deciduous tree cover. Dry stone  
 walls or hedgerows mark field         
 boundaries.The River Amber flows on a 
 north/south route through the area.   
 The most notable buildings are        
 Wingfield Manor, partly destroyed in  
 the Civil War, and the Parish Church  
 which is of Norman origin.            
 Approximately 1,900 people live in    
 the area.                             
 Most people travel outside the area   
 for employment and to shop.           
 Public transport is provided by a once
 hourly bus service to Alfreton and    
 Matlock.                              </content>
