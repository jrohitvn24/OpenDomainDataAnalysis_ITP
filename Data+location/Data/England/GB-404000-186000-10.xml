		<content> It was only recently that 2 signposts 
 were erected to direct motorists to   
 Braydon. One signpost is on the B4040 
 Cricklade to Minety road. At this     
 point Braydon is 2.5 miles away. The  
 second signpost is on the Wooton      
 Bassett to Brinkworth road.           
    Braydon is an extensive sprawling  
 region in the area of the remains of  
 the ancient Bradon Forest. A parish   
 meeting is held annually. Braydon is  
 in the Ecclesiastical parish of       
 Purton, so people from Braydon are    
 buried in Purton.                     
    The land is mostly farmland and the
 Foresty Commision retains an interest 
 in the area.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
