		<content>{Middleton Lodge}was{built in 1780}by  
{Sir John Hartley}who made his money   
 from the{copper mines}around Middleton
 Tyas. Unfortunately he died before the
 building was completed and so he never
 lived in it. It was{designed by}a     
 famous man named{Sir John Carr}who    
 came from York.                       
                                       
 After its completion, it was always   
 let on rental by its{owners}the       
{Middleton Tyas Estates.}It was not    
 until{1946}that its{ownership changed}
 when it was then purchased by{Mr &amp; Mrs
{Ropner. }                             
                                       
 Five years ago it{changed hands}again 
 when it was bought by{Mr &amp; Mrs Allison
 who  are  now  also  its {present     
{occupiers.}
