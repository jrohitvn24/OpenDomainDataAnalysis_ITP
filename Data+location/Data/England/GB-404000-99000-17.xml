		<title>17HOME LIFE MOVING FERNDOWN</title>
		<content> My family have just moved into a      
 bigger house in Ferndown because my   
 Dad has a job here. The weather is    
 better than it was in Solihull and I  
 enjoy living near the sea. There are  
 plenty of activities at the{sports    
{centre}which is within easy walking   
 distance from my home. I used to be at
 a{Junior school}which took children   
 ages 7-11, but here at{Ferndown       
{Middle School}the children start at   
 9 and leave at 13.                    
 There are about 190 children in the   
 first year of our school. Of these, 32
 have moved to{Ferndown}within the last
 two years. Two have come from abroad, 
{America}and{Germany,}but the others   
 were in England, for example,{Suffolk,
{Kent, Essex}and{Wiltshire.}About half 
 moved because their fathers had new   
 jobs and the other half for better    
 housing.                              </content>
