		<content> The school closed in l968 and the     
 children are taken by coach to Ockley 
 and Dorking.  Transport for the       
 villagers is provided twice daily by  
 the post bus.  Police visit from      
 Dorking.                              
                                       
 The population of roughly l60 are     
 mainly commuters but forestry provides
 work for some.  "The Plough Inn" is a 
 popular haunt for the hikers and      
 bikers.  The cricket club still       
 flourishes and the 'Not So Young' Club
 provides outings for the elderly.  The
 Women's Institute meet in their own   
 houses until the new Church Room is   
 completed.
