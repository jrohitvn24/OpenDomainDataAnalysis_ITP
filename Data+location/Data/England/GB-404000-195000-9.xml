		<title>09A DAY AT S.C. POST OFFICE</title>
		<content>  The building is over 200 years old,  
 although it has only become a Post    
 Office recently. It was originally 5  
 cottages for poor folk, owned by the  
 CUTTS charity. The inmates used to    
 break stones in the back yard. Later  
 it became the village reading room. It
 has been a shop for many years now,   
 although the Post Office was only     
 added in 1975.                        
  On Friday 28th June, I sat in the    
 Post Office counting customers. I     
 counted from 9am until noon. 227      
 people came into the shop. The        
 majority were from Cerney: some had   
 walked, others had driven in their    
 cars. Most used the shop at least     
 twice a week, although younger people 
 did most of their shopping in         
 Cirencester. Older customers          
 complained at the prices in Cerney and
 their lack of transport.              </content>
