My favourite game is "colour bulldog", 
one person is chosen  to be on and     
he/she thinks of a colour. If you are  
wearing that colour then you are       
allowed to run across without getting  
caught.If you are not wearing that     
particular colour then you have to run 
across trying not to get caught. If you
caught you are on with the other       
person.The game continues until        
everyonehas been caught.- Rachel Ryan. 
                                       
My favourite game is hopscotch. It is  
so easy to play . All you need is a    
stone and you need a court which is    
numbered from one to ten. You throw the
stone and it will land on a number.    
Then you have to hop through the       
squares except for the one where your  
stone is. You hop over this one.
