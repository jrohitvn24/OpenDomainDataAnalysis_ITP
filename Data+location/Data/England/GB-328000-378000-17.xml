		<title>17FARMING IN NESTON:2</title>
		<content>   {Overdale Farm}is{arable}and has{160
{acres.}There are 17 fields. The{main  
{products}are wheat, potatoes and      
 vegetables. The fields are fertilised 
 with manure and chemical fertilisers. 
   {Machines}that are useful are       
 tractors, combines and potato planters
 and seeders.                          
   {Sales}are local. The wheat goes for
 poultry feeding and occasionally is   
 used for biscuit making. It depends on
 the weather, which affects the        
 wheatgerm. The potatoes and vegetables
 are also sold in local markets.       
{   Problems}on this farm are caused by
 vandals and trespassers. On the day we
 contacted the farmer two new gates had
 been lifted off their hinges. The     
 crops are quite often trampled and the
 potatoes are pulled up.
