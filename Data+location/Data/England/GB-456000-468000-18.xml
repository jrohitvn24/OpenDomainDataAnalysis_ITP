		<title>18Crayke and St Cuthbert</title>
		<content> In AD 685 King Ecgfrith gave to St    
 Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne  the  
 village of creka and around it an area
 of three miles circumference. It was  
 inherited by succeeding bishops of    
 Durham and was prt of Durham County   
 for all purposes.                     
 By the 16th century the North Riding  
 was able to exercise the law in Crayke
 by Reform act of 1832 the Township of 
 Craik of Craikshire' was united to the
 County of york for parliamentary      
 representation. In 1827 the bishop    
 sold his crayke Estate but  retained  
 the rectory                           
 Finally in 1844 Crayke was united to  
 the North Riding for all purposes. A  
 reminder of the past is a public house
 called the 'Durham Ox'.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
