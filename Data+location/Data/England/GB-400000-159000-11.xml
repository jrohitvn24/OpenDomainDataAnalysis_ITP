		<content> The Museum is the headquarters of the 
 Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural  
 History Society and is situated in    
 Long Street.                          
 With so many sites of the early       
 prehistoric period in the county,the  
 collection of Neolithic,Bronze and    
 Iron Age finds is outstanding.        
 There are sixteen rooms in the Museum 
 to display the antiquities which also 
 include a fine selection of mounted   
 natural history specimens of birds and
 animals.                              
 The Museum has been instrumental in   
 the formation of a County Biological  
 Records Centre which should help      
 tremendously in the future            
 conservation and study of wildlife in 
 Wiltshire.                            
 The WATCH Group,the young people's    
 branch of the Conservation Trust,meet 
 regularly at the Museum.              </content>
