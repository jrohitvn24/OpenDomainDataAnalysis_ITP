 During the Civil Wars a battle was    
 fought at Torrington. One Langtree    
 man, Major John Fraine, killed in the 
 battle was buried in Langtree Church  
 where a memorial records his death.   
 During the 18th &amp; 19th Centuries the  
 population rose as agriculture thrived
 in the area.                          
 During the 19th Century Bible         
 Christian Chapels were built in the   
 village, and a Church School which    
 held 130 children. In 1929 the        
 original school was replaced by the   
 present building which now has 63     
 pupils.                               
 Most land of the parish is now owned  
 by individual landowners since the    
 Clinton family who succeeded the      
 Rolles were forced to sell much of    
 their estates in the 1950's.
