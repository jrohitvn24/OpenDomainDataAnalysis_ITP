		<content>Although the passenger railway closed  
in 1966,a train still runs about twice 
a week carrying spent nuclear fuel from
Sizewell Power Station.Most people in  
Leiston travel by car if they want to  
leave the town.Some travel by bus to   
Saxmundham to catch a train to Ipswich 
or Lowestoft.Apart from this there is  
a county bus which leaves Aldeburgh,   
via Leiston,for Ipswich about every    
hour. It takes two hours to get to     
Ipswich by bus,half an hour by car!    
Some people travel by a coach which    
runs from Great Yarmouth,              
stopping at Leiston on its journey     
to London.This takes four hours from   
our town.Coaches are also used to      
bring children from surrounding        
villages to school.Others take people  
to many parts of Britain on            
holiday.Fire engines are also based in 
the town.                              </content>
