		<content>pleasure craft.The facilities at iron  
wharf,the building of east countryman  
barges by P.Winch,the small boat       
building and repair at the old         
shipyard and the new town jetty may    
mean more visiting small craft and     
more money spent in the town.Only 2    
industries dominate today and both are 
involved in fertilizer and animal      
feed.Pauls have 1 vessel of 300 tons   
per month with soya &amp; tapioca from     
Antwerp.Gilletts using 30 vessels p.a. 
also export grain to the continent.One 
mill is gloomy over future prospects   
especially if the channel tunnel is    
built.The other is optimistic &amp; has    
installed a 500,000 pound computer     
system.The town seems to have turned   
its back on the creek in the past      
decade.There is little positive        
action and investment but it remains a 
tourist attraction.                    </content>
