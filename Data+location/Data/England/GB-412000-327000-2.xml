		<title>02Draycott in the Clay housing</title>
		<content> The housing in{Draycott in the Clay  }
 ranges from small terraced cottages to
 large farmhouses and executive style  
 houses. The village has a council     
 estate of 20 to 30 properties and a   
 private estate which is slightly      
 larger. Over the past few years many  
 of the council houses have been       
 purchased by their occupiers. The     
 area is not on mains gas, most houses 
 use either oil or solid fuel for      
 heating. Some of the older farms were 
 built about A.D. 1700.                
                                       
 Recently a number of houses which were
 formerly part of an army camp, and    
 empty for many years, have been       
 rennovated and are now occupied.      
{A typical 4 bedroom detached house in 
{the village would cost about Â£45,000, 
{but other properties are available    
{from as little as Â£15,000.            </content>
