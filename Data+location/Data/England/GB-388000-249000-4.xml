		<title>04Parish Councillor, Stoulton</title>
		<content>     A leading Parish Councillor lives 
 in the former vicarage which is now a 
 private dwelling. The old vicarage, a 
 Tudor building, had adjoining stables 
 which provided horses for the London  
 stage coach. The councillor also spoke
 about the Maltings which used to be a 
 brewery and supplied beer to the      
 Talbot, both of which have closed     
 down. The Maltings was then converted 
 into a Post Office but is now a       
 private house.                        
    Most village events are organised  
 by the Parish Council. The Church Fete
 is very popular. The Flower Show is   
 the top Dahlia show locally. The      
 Parish Council also deals with        
 footpaths, planning and road repair   
 applications. They fought successfully
 to get a 40mph speed limit through the
 village and to have a telephone box   
 removed from a dangerous cross roads. </content>
