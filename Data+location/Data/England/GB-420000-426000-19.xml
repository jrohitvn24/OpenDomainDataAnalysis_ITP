		<content> A Day in the life of Matthew Ellis.Age
 9.I wake up and go downstairs.I know  
 what we are having for breakfast      
 because we have the same thing every  
 morning.We have marmalade on toast and
 cornflakes,and Ribena to drink.By this
 time it is 25 to 9 so I decide to see 
 what is on television.Most times      
 cartoons are on.Sometimes we play on  
 bikes and sometimes we play football  
 so we play football.                  
 For dinner I have cheese on cream     
 crackers.In the afternoon I go to     
 Bradford to get a record.I go to      
 Virgin Records.When I come home I     
 listen to the final score.I also watch
 television or the video.              
 At school we watch a T.V programme    
 about Denmark.We go to the swimming   
 baths.Back at school we do maths.We   
 have topic time and after play,drawing
 or weaving.                           </content>
