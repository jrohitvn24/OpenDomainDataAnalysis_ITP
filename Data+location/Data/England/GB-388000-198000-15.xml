		<title>15AVENING MILL AND POND</title>
		<content> The Avening mill pond and mill are on 
 the right as you come down Tetbury    
 Hill, just past M.&amp; J.Foodstores.     
 Down the lane, on the right is a      
 fast-flowing stream and on your left  
 is the mill.  Much of the mill is old 
 but a new extension has been built.   
 The mill used to be a corn mill but   
 now it is used for paper distribution.
 It serves the whole of England and    
 there are many big lorries going down 
 the lane; seven times our garden wall 
 has been knocked downj.  The paper is 
 of varying sizes, colours and shapes  
 and the people there work very hard. a
 bit farther down the lane on your left
 is an orange skip full of waste paper.
  Beyond that you can look into the    
 dark pond full of trout and eels.
