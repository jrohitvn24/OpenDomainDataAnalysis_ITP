		<content>   The{River Thames}passes through     
 Lechlade. It is wide and twisty and a 
 big tourist attraction. There are     
 boats on the River all day and you can
 hire them from the riverside which    
 used to be a warehouse for Thames     
 barges which used to carry coal and   
 wool. There is a huge free car park   
 and there are walks along the         
 riverbank past fishermen to{St. John's
{Lock}or the{Roundhouse}where the      
 Thames meets the{Coln}and             
{Thames-Severn Canal.}Water is piped   
 from the Coln to{Buscot Water Works   
 and distributed to{Faringdon.}There   
 are seven public houses, restaurants  
 and tea rooms in Lechlade and many    
 antique and craft shops to browse     
 around. This ancient market town is a 
 popular{residential area,}with many   
 people working in London, Swindon,    
 Cirencester and places far and wide.  </content>
