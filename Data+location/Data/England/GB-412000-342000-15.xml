		<content>Mayfield Mill is situated on the River 
Dove and occupies a twenty three and a 
half acre site of which five acres is  
production area.  It is part of the    
Allied Textile Corporation and         
employs 130 men and women in the       
factory and offices.  They process     
25,000 kilos of yarn each month with   
customers at home and abroad.  Manmade 
yarns come into the mill to be         
processed ready for customers          
individual uses.  The first process is 
to "warp" the yarn.  It is then        
returned to the customer or processed  
further.                               
  Japanese Tsudakuma machines are used 
to make yarn ready for use as computer 
tape and typewriter ribbon.  Picnol Air
Jet and water assisted machines also   
weave yarn.  The knit-de-knit process  
provides a stretchy yarn ready for use 
in tights, socks and thermal underwear.</content>
