		<title>07Housing on Todmorden Moor</title>
		<content> The{housing}of the area is very       
 scattered. Originally most of the     
 houses would have been farmhouses but 
 these have more recently been         
 developed as private residences. The  
 moor is criss-crossed by three or four
 isolated roads and bounded by the     
 Bacup Road from Todmorden to          
 Sharneyford on one side and the       
 Burnley Road from Todmorden to        
 Cliviger on the other side. Due to the
 steep sided nature of both these      
 valleys any development has been a    
{ribbon development}along the narrow   
 valley bottoms. The only centres of   
 population are{Sharneyford}on the     
 Bacup Road and{Cornholme}on the       
 Burnley Road. Sharneyford has one     
 small primary school which is in the  
 Lancashire education authority and    
 Cornholme also has a primary school in
 the Calderdale education authority.   </content>
