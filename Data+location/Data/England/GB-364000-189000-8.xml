		<content> I come to school at 8.45 and (after   
 hanging up my coat in our cloakroom) I
 go into my classroom and start work.  
 At 8.55 the teacher takes the register
 and we all go to the hall where the   
 headteacher speaks to us. From 9.30 to
 10.40 I work by myself at whatever of 
 my work needs to be finished. We then 
 have ten minutes playtime when I      
 usually play football with my friends.
 When I return to the classroom        
 sometimes we have P.E. or I sit on the
 carpet with my teacher and a group of 
 other children for a lesson on English
 or Mathematics. We have our lunch at  
 school and at 1.25 the afternoon      
 session starts. We read quietly for a 
 quarter of an hour and then our work  
 varies every day until just before    
 home time when our teacher reads to   
 us.                                   
                                       </content>
