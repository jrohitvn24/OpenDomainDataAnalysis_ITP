		<title>20A GENERAL SUMMARY OF BLOCK.</title>
		<content> Ww have all seen many changes and it  
 is interesting to speculate on what   
 the future holds.The area remains     
 unspoilt although with changes in     
 farming methods,there have been some  
 changes in the environment.Intensive  
 land management and farm mechanisation
 have resulted in farms being less     
 labour intensive,leading to a decline 
 in population.The Forestry Commission 
 do not employ large numbers           
 now.Communications are by road,post   
 and telephone.The small school is     
 retained.St.Nicxolas' Church serves   
 the Parish of Nicholforest.Community  
 spirit is good,friendly and           
 helpful.People move into the district 
 from both sides of the Border.Work is 
 taken outside area unless of farming  
 stock.A  few trades in area.This      
 contribution has come from            
 Warwicksland,a small part of Penton.  </content>
