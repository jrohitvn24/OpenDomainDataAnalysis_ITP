		<content> THE LOCAL AREA OF WHADDON AND LYNWORTH
 IS MOSTLY{HOUSING.}MOST OF THE        
 BUILDINGS ARE HOUSES, WITH SOME FLATS 
 AND A FEW BUNGALOWS. THERE ARE THREE  
 SMALL{FACTORIES}IN THE AREA AND SOME  
 PEOPLE WORK THERE OR AT THE NEARBY    
{G.C.H.Q.}OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK IN 
 TOWN THOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF     
 PEOPLE WHO ARE{UNEMPLOYED.}WE DID A   
 TRAFFIC SURVEY OF THE TWO MAIN ROADS  
 IN THE AREA. BOUNCERS LANE HAS A      
{THROUGH TRAFFIC}SIGN WHICH MAKES MORE 
 VEHICLES PASS ALONG IT THAN ALONG THE 
 PRESTBURY ROAD WHICH LEADS INTO TOWN. 
 WHADDON, LYNWORTH AND PRESTBURY HAVE  
 THEIR OWN{PRIMARY SCHOOLS}BUT WHEN THE
 CHILDREN REACH THE AGE OF ELEVEN THEY 
 HAVE TO{TRAVEL}ACROSS TOWN TO GET{TO A
{SECONDARY SCHOOL.
