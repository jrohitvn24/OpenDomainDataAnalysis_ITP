 Our grid area is mainly agricultural  
 land.The Fox hunt was disbanded in    
 1984.The one sport left now is clay   
 pigeon shooting.The aim of the sport  
 is to soot a clay disc ( known as a   
 pigen)to dust with a high volocity    
 shot cartridge.The clays are propelled
 from a spring loaded 'TRAP' that can  
 drive them in different patterns._DOWN

 JUMP.Hits are recorded on a card like 
 this K=KILL,L=LOSS=MISS.Their are 3   
 types of guns and the most suitable is

 and under,side by side)with

 lighter gun like a 4.10&amp;20 bore.
