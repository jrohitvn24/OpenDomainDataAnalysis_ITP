		<title>01BARLING MAGNA</title>
		<content>  Barling is a very nice village near  
 Southend-on-Sea. When the Saxons came 
 here they anchored in the creek and   
 some people believe that their leader 
 Berela built his house beside the     
 marshes. The settlement was called    
 after him. Later it changed to        
 Barling. Other people say that the    
 name comes from two Saxon words "ban" 
 a boar and "ing" a meadow. The older  
 part is near the church but much of   
 the newer housing stretches along     
 Little Wakering Road.It is a quiet    
 place and all round us is flat        
 farmland.The River Roach is to the    
 North of the village and Barling Creek
 winds round it. The nearest railway   
 station is in Shoebury and it takes an
 hour to travel to London. From        
 Southend there are two separate       
 railways to London.
