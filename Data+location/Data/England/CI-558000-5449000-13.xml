		<title>13LIFE IN ST.PETER</title>
		<content> It is not very quiet and peaceful     
 around my house. We have a lot of     
 farms round our way. I live by a farm 
 with my Mum, Dad and two brothers     
 called Peter and Christopher. Peter   
 has got a television, a clock radio   
 and a computer. I have a clock radio  
 and a Walkman cassette player.        
 Christopher is only three and         
 three-quarter years old. He has a lot 
 of cuddly toys. Like a lot of houses  
 we have a cooker, television, freezer,
 washing machine, drier and fridge. It 
 is not very quiet around our house    
 because we live near the Airport. In  
 the field at the back there is a row  
 of lights to help the planes land.    
 There are a lot of cows grazing by our
 house and farmers grow potatoes,      
 cauliflowers, cucumbers and peppers.
