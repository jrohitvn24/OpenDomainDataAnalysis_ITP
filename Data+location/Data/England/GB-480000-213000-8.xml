		<title>08ECOLOGY IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>  Rare plants and animals in Aylesbury 
are few but there is much variety.     
{Wildlife} has not been greatly        
affected by building programmes        
although a new ringroad threatens a    
small section of wetland. The council  
sends details of   planning            
applications to Aylesbury museum which 
objects if the construction will       
affect important wildlife. Because the 
countryside is so close to Aylesbury,  
conservation is usually concentrated   
outside the town and the public has    
only begun to conserve wildlife here   
during the past 5 years. Areas of      
wildlife which have been ruined are    
being balanced by numerous people      
{creating ponds} and growing plants in 
their {gardens} which attract wildlife.
The {canal}, {railway} embankments and 
sewage works are renowned for the      
wildlife found there.                  </content>
