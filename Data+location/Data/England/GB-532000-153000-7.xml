    Pilgrims Fort is on the{NORTH DOWNS
{WAY}at{VIEWPOINT.}It is presently     
 owned by Croydon Council and used as  
 an outdoor study centre for schools.  
 There is still evidence of the{IRON   
{AGE HILL FORT}to see.                 
                                       
    The enemy had to climb up a steep  
 slope and then over a stockade under  
 the fire of the defenders. If they    
 broke the first fence they found they 
 were in a ditch with another slope and
 fence in front of them. The ditch is  
 still very clearly seen.
