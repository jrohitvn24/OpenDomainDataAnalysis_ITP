		<title>19Thoughts On Our Last Year</title>
		<content>    A new school year is always a      
 nervous and exciting time.For us it   
 was to be the last at Primary School. 
 We were soon given jobs such as School
 Savings Bank or Tuck Shop helpers.    
 House captains were elected from among
 us as we settled to the year's work.  
    A harvest festival was followed by 
 casting for the pantomime,Sleeping    
 Beauty,eventually acclaimed by two    
 packed houses as the best ever.The    
 Christmas party and films all helped  
 to make a memorable term.             
    Spring Term ended with an Easter   
 concert and thoughts of a five day    
 visit to Mid-Wales in May which was a 
 huge success. Our 6 a side netball and
 football,inter-school cross country,a 
 nature quiz,chess matches,the Sports,a
 Folk Dance festival,a visit to our new
 school,a swimming gala and much else  
 leave us with memories to treasure.   </content>
