		<title>13HAMPDEN PARK LEVEL CROSSING</title>
		<content> A level crossing is a place where a   
 railway crosses a road.I think that   
 the Hampden Park Level Crossing is one
 of the busiest in the country. It     
 causes a traffic jam by holding up    
 traffic coming from three directions. 
 The roundabout which also has several 
 branches, Brassey Avenue via the shops
 and Lottbridge Drive.Some people think
 they ought to build a bridge over the 
 railway for cars.This is not possible,
 partly as it would cost thousands of  
 pounds and partly because the ground  
 is level and all built on.The         
 automatic lifting barriers cover the  
 whole road.This is controlled by a    
 button which the signalman presses    
 when a train is coming.There is a     
 double warning system(lights and a    
 bell).When two trains arrive          
 simultaneously there is a big queue.{
