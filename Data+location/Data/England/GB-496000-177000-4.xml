		<content> Royal travellers from Windsor         
 castle going north to join the early  
 east -west tracks or travelling       
 further north to the Norman castle of 
 Berkhamstead had to cross the marshy  
 flood plains of the Thames.At the     
 junction of these tracks Slough(a     
 miry place)was born .                 
  Slough remained a small town         
 providing services for travellers     
 until the advent of the railway in    
 Slough,positioned here rather than    
 Windsor at the insistence  of the     
 Provost of Eton college who feared the
 boys might escape by train!           
  Further growth came in the 1920's    
 with the birth of the trading estate  
 which is the source of most of        
 Slough's present wealth.
