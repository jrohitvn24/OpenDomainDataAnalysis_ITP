		<title>18WHY WE CAME TO LIVE HERE</title>
		<content> Our move to East Meon in August 1984  
 was the result of need and happy      
 circumstance. The need was to find a  
 location roughly equidistant between  
 my place of work and my wife's newly  
 relocated government office. The      
 cicumstance related to the house-and  
 apparently Tudor thatched building in 
 this lovely village-which had failed  
 the sale of auction and which could   
 thus be bought privately in the time  
 scale within which we needed to       
 operate. We had not expected to be    
 able to buy such a house in such a    
 location but we moved out in faith and
 everything just fell into place!
