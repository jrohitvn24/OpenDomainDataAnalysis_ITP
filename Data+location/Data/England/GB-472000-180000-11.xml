		<title>11Sports Centre Report</title>
		<content>The Sports Centre was first opened in  
1977, and the Manager, Mr. Phillips was
there then,six months before opening.He
was brought in early to find staff.    
Although deaths are non-existent, a lot
of injuries have come from going to the
Centre.                                
   Mr. Phillips works 37 hours a week, 
and he has 28 people to help him, 23 of
which are part time. Sometimes Mr.     
Phillips does more than his share. The 
Centre has many sporting activities,   
but the most popular are badminton and 
swimming. The most recent addition to  
the clubs is Ju-Jitsu, which is like   
Judo/Karate. They might have a squash  
club, as squash courts have been built 
on to the Centre.                      
   Like most buildings, the Centre is  
worth more than it was. It cost        
180,000  to build but if it was which  
it won't be,Mr.Phillips and companies  </content>
