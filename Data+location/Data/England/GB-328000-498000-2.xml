		<content>{FARMING}Sheep farming is the main type
 of agriculture in our area with the   
{Herdwick}&amp;{Swaledale}breeds being most
 important. The sheep graze on the open
 fell for most of the year but are     
 gathered for dipping,clipping,putting 
 to the rams, castrating &amp; dosing. They
 are{"heafed"}to their own fell i.e.   
 they know it and always return to it. 
  Store cattle are grazed on the lower 
 slopes and the calves are suckled by  
 the cows using the multi-suckler      
 approach.                             
   {Forestry}is an important branch of 
 farming in Cumbria and coniferous     
 plantations are to be found but the   
 old established deciduous coppice     
 woodland is still an important part of
 the local scene where it occurs on    
 lower slopes and in valleys.          
    Fewer people now work on fell farms
 because of increased mechanisation.   </content>
