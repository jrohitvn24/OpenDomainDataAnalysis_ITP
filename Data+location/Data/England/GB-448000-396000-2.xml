		<title>02Life Style in Clifton</title>
		<content> Clifton is an isolated{farming}hamlet,
 two km. away from school.An old lady  
 we spoke to told us that when she was 
 young, six butchers , a fishmonger ,  
 a co-op , a baker and a hardware      
 salesman visited the{village}regularly
 using mobile shops.Now only a         
 travelling library visits once a      
 fortnight and a baker delivers three  
 times a week. Clifton had five farms. 
 Recently when one farmer died the     
 house was demolished and the land was 
 divided to make four farms.A bus calls
 from Doncaster via Edlington at 0830, 
 1000 and then at 1400. The last bus to
 return to Clifton leaves at 1800      
 .There is a{Church}that only opens one
 Sunday per month.
