 rocky crags, at one time a deer park. 
 In 18th century Sir Walter Blackett   
 had two follies constructed, Codgers  
 Castle, on the Alemouth road, might   
 have been militry. Rothley Castle was 
 an ornamental eyecatcher. Rothley     
 Lakes were designed by Capability     
 Brown.  Later came the railway now    
 disused. There has been much mining   
 and quarrying with recent opencast.   
 Cottages have at times extended along 
 all the road to Longwitton, housing   
 miners and quarrymen. Deserted        
 medieval villages are at Rothley and  
 Longwitton.Forestry covers some mining
 areas The only transport is school    
 buses and no amenities.Farms rear     
 sheep and cattle,with little corn on  
 lower ground. Rothle Farm hs a plastic
 tunnel for sheep-lambing and
