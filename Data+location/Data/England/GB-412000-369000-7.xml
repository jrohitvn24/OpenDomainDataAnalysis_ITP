		<title>07Hubberdale Farm - Flagg</title>
		<content>    Mr.Jack Howe who has lived at the  
 farm for all his seventy four years   
 and as a boy walked over the fields to
 Taddington School,related how up to   
 thirty years ago-before the advent of 
 mains water-carts went into Flagg     
 village to collect water drawn up from
 a mineshaft.Outside the farmhouse  is 
 a spoilheap from the Hubberdale       
 Leadmine now only a fraction of its   
 former size since a former owner had  
 to use most of the heap-then as high  
 as the two storey farmhouse-to fill in
 the collapsed farmyard which one night
 fell into the underground mine        
 workings! His younger partner recently
 drove a gatepost through the ground   
 into the sough which comes out at     
 Deepdale,Taddington.The mine itself is
 grassed over and apart from the capped
 shafts there is little evidence of its
 former frenzied activity.             </content>
