		<title>12Education in Alresford</title>
		<content> Alresford has a population of 2300,   
 and just one village primary school.  
 This is a fairly new school, catering 
 for 4-11 year olds and is attended by 
 approximately 200 children.           
  There is no secondary school, either 
 public or private in the village, and 
 the children over 11 have to travel to
 Brightlingsea, Colchester or elsewhere
 to continue their education.  This    
 generally presents little problem     
 since communications are good and     
 there is a regular bus service from   
 Colchester, Clacton and Brigtlingsea  
 to Alresford.  There is also a good   
 train service from the village to     
 Clacton, Walton and Colchester.       
  As well as the Alresford primary     
 school the village has a pre-school   
 playgroup and a toddlers group.
