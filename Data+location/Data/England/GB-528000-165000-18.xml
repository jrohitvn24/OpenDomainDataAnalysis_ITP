		<title>18LITTER IN CROYDON</title>
		<content>     90,000 tonnes of rubbish from     
130,000 premises is collected every    
year from the Croydon area, and most   
of it ends up in Factory Lane Depot.   
All the boroughs' vehicles are based   
at Stubbs Mead (main entrance Factory  
Lane). When it is windy the rubbish    
swirls around the area, and when it is 
warm it is very smelly.  When the dump 
is closed thoughtless people put their 
rubbish outside the gates and along    
Factory Lane.                          
     Road cleaning is messy and hard   
work, but we have electric vans with   
brushes on the front.  They go on the  
pavements and roads making a special   
sweep on Saturdays around the centre   
of Croydon. Litter is a big problem    
all over the country.  In Croydon,     
people from the M.S.C. are visiting    
schools and helping to keep our area   
pleasant to live in.                   </content>
