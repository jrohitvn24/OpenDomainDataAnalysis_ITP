		<content> TRANSPORT IS VERY POOR IN BROUGH      
 THE SERVICE BUSES STOPPED COMPLETELY  
 ON THE 18TH OF MAY 1985.NOW THERE     
 IS ONLY A SCHOOL BUS GOING TO         
 KIRKBY STEPHEN.A FEW YEARS AGO THE    
 CLOCK HAD TO BE MOVED BACK 4 FEET     
 TO MAKE WAY FOR THE TRAFFIC WHEN THE  
 BRIDGE WAS BUILT,BEFORE THE BY PASS   
 WAS MADE BROUGH WAS A LOT BUSIER      
 BECAUSE ALL THE CARS HAD TO GO THROUGH
 BROUGH TO GET ONTO THE A66.           
   THERE ALSO USED TO BE A TRAIN GOING 
 NEAR BROUGH BUT A MAN CALLED MR       
 BEECHINGS STOPPED IT.NOW THERE IS ONLY
 A LITTLE PART OF THE RAILWAY LEFT TO  
 TO TAKE AMMUNITION TO THE ARMY CAMP   
 AT WARCOP.                            
   EVERY ONE HAS TO HAVE ETHER A CAR OR
 A MOTORBIKE TO GO ANYWHERE LIKE       
 APPLEBY AND PENRITH.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
