		<content> As I woke up,"Uh!" I groaned &amp; crawled
 out of bed.I went into the kitchen &amp;  
 had my breakfast of cereal milk &amp;     
 orange juice,then I got washed &amp;      
 dressed.I couldn't go into the lounge 
 as my Dad was Hoovering so I read     
 computer magazines in my bedroom until
 11am.Then i went to my gran's with Dad
 until noon &amp; then returned home for my
 lunch.We finished at one &amp; then went  
 into the lounge &amp; read the newspapers.
 Then my sister asked if Dad would take
 her down to friend's house.After he   
 returned we watched T.V. for 4 hours &amp;
 then played on my computer for a      
 couple of hours.At 7:30pm.my sister   
 returned home.We then watched "Juliet 
 Bravo", "Sorry!" &amp; "That's life" &amp;    
 then I went to bed.
