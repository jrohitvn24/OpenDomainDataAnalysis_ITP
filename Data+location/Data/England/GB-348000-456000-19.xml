		<content> We interviewed a girl of 8 who lives  
 in a modern house, which was built    
 three years ago, with her mother,     
 father and two sisters.  She gets up  
 at half past 7, has her breakfast at 8
 and goes to school at 8.30 in         
 Lancaster.  Her mother and father go  
 to work at the same time.  Her father 
 works at the White Land Trading       
 Estate and her mother works at the    
 university.  When she has her         
 breakfast at 8 o'clock she has        
 cornflakes.  At school her favorite   
 games are adventure games.  After     
 school she plays her hobby, tennis.   
 At tea tine she has all sorts of      
 different things but her favorite tea 
 is egg and chips.  She watches        
 television and at 8 o'clock goes to   
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
