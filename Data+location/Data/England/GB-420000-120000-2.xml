		<title>02St Mary's Church,Redlynch</title>
		<content> St Mary's Church was built in 1837    
 because people had to walk a long way 
 to Downton church.The wife of the then
 vicar of Downton gave a clock to the  
 church and 16 pounds a year so that   
 the children of Redlynch could have a 
 teacher.                              
         The family from Newhouse and  
 the family from Hamptworth Lodge each 
 have a pew at the front of the        
 church.In the past they gave things to
 the church including the stained glass
 windows and the organ.                
     In the graveyard are stone ,wood  
 and iron graves.The iron ones were    
 made in the village.One grave is      
 decorated with pretty coloured        
 tiles.It is for Harriet Whitmarsh who 
 died in 1876 when she was a young     
 teacher at our school.
