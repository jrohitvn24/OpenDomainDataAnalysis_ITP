		<title>05Working people in Tetsworth</title>
		<content>We asked the people who lived in the   
village what job they did and where    
they worked.Only one person, in those  
who replied, was out of work and 15%   
are retired. We sorted the workers     
into groups and counted the replies:   
      Engineering       15%            
      Service industry  15%            
      Building          12%            
      Management        10%            
      Office workers    10%            
      Health             7%            
      Representatives    7%            
      Farming            6%            
      Education          3%            
Only 12% work in the village, 24%      
travel less than 5 miles, 24% travel   
between 5 and 10 miles and the rest go 
more than 10 miles to work. Nearly 25% 
travel to London everyday, confirming  
our thoughts that Tetsworth is becoming
a commuter village.                    </content>
