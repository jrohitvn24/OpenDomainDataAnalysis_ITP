		<content> The major planned housing development 
 in this area is at the USAF Air Base, 
 RAF Woodbridge. Here there are some   
 257 houses in which servicemen and    
 their families live.  There is also   
 single-person accommodation for about 
 400 Air Force personnel, 100-odd of   
 whom are women. Both types of accom-  
 modation on the Base have been        
 purpose-planned and built.            
                                       
 There is little other housing in this 
 rural area (less than 20 houses), but 
 what exists is generally scattered and
 consists of older houses occupied by  
 Forestry employees and tenants, local 
 farm workers, or Officers working at  
 the Hollesley Bay Borstal Colony.
