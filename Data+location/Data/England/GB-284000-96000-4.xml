		<title>04NEWTON HOUSE NEWTON ST.CYRES</title>
		<content> Newton House was{burned down}to the   
 ground and{rebuilt in 1907.}The       
 building looks quite old and it is    
 light grey and brown in colour. It    
 looks old fashioned, whilst the       
 building next to Newton House looks   
 new.  It looks smaller from the front 
 than it does from the back. The house 
 looks like an L shape at the back. We 
{counted 53 windows that we could see. 
 There are two large gardens. Formerly 
 the Quicke family home, it has now    
 been{converted into 7 flats. The      
{footbridge from Newton House to the   
{Church, which crosses the main road,  
{is controlled by the residents.}A     
 banner advertising the School SUMMER  
 SHOW/GYMKHANA has been hung from there
 in the last few years during June.    
 The entrance to Newton House is in    
 Station Road.
