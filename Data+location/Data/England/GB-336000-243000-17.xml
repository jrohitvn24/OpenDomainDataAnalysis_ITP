		<content> PRIMARY SCHOOL STAUNTON ON WYE        
 The endowed primary school is housed  
 in a rather large rambling victorian  
 building owned by the Jarvis Trust.   
 The LEA maintain the interior  and the
 Trust the exterior building. The      
 school numbers about 30 pupils but has
 had up to 100 pupils. The children    
 aged rising 5 - 11 are divided into 2 
 classes, infant and junior with a     
 teaching head and assistant teacher.  
 Pupils come from the village and      
 surrounding parishes. A flourishing   
 voluntary-run playgroup meets in the  
 redundant school kitchen 3 mornings a 
 week, taking children from 3-5 with   
 one parent helping the organisers. The
 group has raised money to buy         
 equipment and a charge of 80p per     
 child helps to cover expenses.
