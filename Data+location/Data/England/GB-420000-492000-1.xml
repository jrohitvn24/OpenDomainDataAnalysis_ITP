		<content> This is a predominantly agricultural  
 area with many farms in it.The        
 farmland is fertile and is used mainly
 for dairy farming and crops of grass, 
 corns(especially barley)and potatoes. 
 Many of the farms are old established 
 farms.The largest centre of populatian
 is Hornby village.This small village  
 developed around the castle and many  
 of the buildings are associated with  
 the castle.There is quite an expanse  
 of woodland near the castle-some of   
 this is newly planted with conifers   
 and is reserved for rearing pheasants.
 There is also a series of lakes       
 running south and east from the castle
 On one of these lakes is a duck decoy.
