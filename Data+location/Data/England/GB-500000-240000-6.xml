		<title>06INTERVIEW WITH A WORKER</title>
		<content> 5. What was your job at the works?    
{I had to drive trucks into the quarry,
{or "nut hole" to collect the clay. One
{of them is where Stewartby lake is.   
{This carried on for a good few years, 
{then after my accident, hurting my    
{back, I was transferred to            
{maintenance in the sheds, where I had 
{to fix the machines.}                 
 6. What happened to you in the        
 accident?                             
{A crane caught me in the quarry and   
{hit my back. It took me about two     
{months to get better.}                
 7. What time did you get up?          
{Very early, about 5.30 every morning. 
{I left at 6.00am on my bike. I never  
{had a car.}                           
 8. Do you know of anyone else who     
 worked there?                         
{Of course! Nearly everyone was a      
{farmer or brickworker.                </content>
