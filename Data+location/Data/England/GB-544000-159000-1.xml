		<content> Villages on the rim of the Greater    
London Area are greatly cherished in   
these days of the urban sprawl. This   
area of 12 square kilometres lies      
between 4 such villages,Pratts Bottom, 
Downe,Cudham and Knockholt and is in   
the centre of the Green Belt often said
to be the "lungs of London". In all    
these villages it is still possible to 
find peace and clean air.              
 There is little in the way of industry
other than farming, with many of the   
residents commuting to London to work. 
 The area is very popular at weekends  
as people leave the towns in search of 
recreation. Riding and walking are very
popular pursuits and the local inns are
well frequented.                       
 Housing is varied, from small cottages
to large mansions and is very expensive
as demand is high. The following pages 
give a brief description of the area.  </content>
