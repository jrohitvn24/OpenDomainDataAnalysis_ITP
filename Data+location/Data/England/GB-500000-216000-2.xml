		<title>02Recreation in Whipsnade</title>
		<content> Parishioners of Whipsnade depend on   
 their own hobbies to use up leisure   
 time. There are no established        
 recreational sports or games. The     
 younger generations can go to other   
 parishes or towns' Leisure Centres but
 depend mainly on their parents for    
 transport by car. The adults have     
 their homes and gardens to tend,      
 Women's Institute and Flower Group.   
 All ages can watch television and     
 videos, listen to the radio, walk the 
 family dog on the Common and National 
 Trust Land, visit the Zoo, the Tree   
 Cathedral, go over the Downs to play  
 golf, or ride horses on the bridle    
 paths. To raise Funds for charities   
 there are Church Fetes, Social        
 Functions, Bingo Evenings, Whist      
 Drives, Jumble Sales, Flea Markets and
 Coffee Mornings.
