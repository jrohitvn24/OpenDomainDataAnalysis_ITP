		<title>09Shopping near to Tavistock</title>
		<content>        Our most populated areas are   
 Chilsworthy and Latchley, two small   
 villages  which  are  surrounded by   
 bigger towns  and  villages. To the   
 north is{ Launceston,}a castle town,  
 approximately 20 kilometres by road.  
 To the  south lies  the {city of      
{Plymouth}which is some 24 km by road  
 but only 13 km as the crow flies.To   
 the west is{Callington,}6 km, and to  
 the east is{Tavistock,}a distance of  
 8 km. The{majority of people}who took 
 part in a survey, shop in{Tavistock,  
{Devon,}although this is closely       
 followed by those taking advantage of 
 the facilities offered by{Callington. 
 Launceston doesn't seem to attract the
 custom from the survey area. Very few 
 seem to shop locally and  although    
 Plymouth is a very big shopping       
 centre, very few seem to go there on a
 regular basis.                        </content>
