		<title>07CUSTOMS - OPEN MARKET</title>
		<content>      It's Saturday morning and I get  
 up at 6.OO a.m. to help my mother on  
 the two{market stalls }she owns.  I   
 get a cup of coffee and slice of toast
 and marmalade jam with orange peel in 
 it.  Then I wash my cup and plate and 
 help mummy make up the flasks and     
 sandwiches.  About quarter to seven we
 go down to the market.  We get all the
{handbags}out of the cardboard boxes   
 and stand them on the stall. We sell  
 as much as we can, then we have a pie 
 from the shop and eat it.  After that 
 we pack all the bags away and go home 
 about 17.OO hours and watch television
 until 2O.OO hours.  Then we go out to 
 the Indian Take-away and get a curry. 
 I get a Madras and my mum and dad get 
 Vindaloo.  I eat this, help with the  
 dishes and go to bed.
