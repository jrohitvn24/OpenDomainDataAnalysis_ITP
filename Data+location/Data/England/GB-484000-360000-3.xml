		<content>   The village  was a farming community
 with{farm houses and stack yards}along
 High Street. The oldest is  Manor Farm
 1695, now known as Manor House.       
   Since  the 2nd World War life styles
 and  farming have changed.  New houses
 have been built on the stack yards and
 the farm  houses  sold and modernised.
 In  the  surrounding  area  there  are
 fewer farms but they are larger.      
    Collingham Road, Meadow View, Manor
 Road  and   Newton  Close   have  been
 developed on farm land and allotments.
 There are 2 groups of {Council houses,
 some{private houses}and bungalows  and
 a  group  of  specially  designed{ old
{peoples bungalows.}                   
  {Norton Disney Hall}is no longer part
 of the Estate.  Norton  was the  Saxon
 name for village.  Disney  comes  from
 D'Isney  the Norman Lord who was given
 the land by William the Conqueror.    </content>
