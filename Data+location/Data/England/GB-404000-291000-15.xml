		<content> There has been a small wood at Perry  
Beeches since 1840;it was a mature     
mixed woodland in an area that almost  
exactly corresponds with the present   
nature reserve.The wood remained intact
until a shortage of coal in the 1940's 
resulted in local people felling the   
trees for fuel.                        
 The wood began to recover naturally   
but the uncared-for appearance of the  
wood attracted vandals and fly tippers.
The opening of the M6 Motorway in 1972 
caused noise and air pollution problems
as well as impeding natural drainage.  
 In 1984 a Manpower Services Commission
finaced team from Task Undertakings    
Ltd.cleared the 4.5 acres of rubbish   
and constructed a network of paths;the 
sycamores were felled and a pond was   
dug.                                   
 The reserve is open to all local      
schools.                               </content>
