		<title>02THE WEALD</title>
		<content> The Weald has the last remaining      
 tracts of the great forest of         
{Anderida.}These forests provided      
 grazing for cattle and timber for     
 building and ships. Felling was       
 particularly heavy when the{iron      
{industry}reached its peak between 1500
 and 1650. The last furnace closed in  
 1813. Many fellings were restocked but
{hammer ponds,}the source of water for 
 the{forges,}still remain as at        
{Chiddinglye}and{Little Strudgate.     
   Typical steep sided valleys run from
 north to south. A sandstone ridge lies
 diagonally across the north east      
 stretching from{Turners Hill}south    
 east to{West Hoathly}and is the       
 watershed of two rivers, the{Medway   
 and the{Ouse.}The aerial view shows   
 farms in clearings much dominated by  
 deciduous woodland.
