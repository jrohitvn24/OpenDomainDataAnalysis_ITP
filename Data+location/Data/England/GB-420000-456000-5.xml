		<content>   The main road through the block is  
 the A59, Harrogate-Skipton road, run- 
 ning East-West along the southern edge
 of the block, at an altitude of       
 approx. 200 metres. It follows the    
 line of the old Roman road known      
 locally as "Watling Street," an off-  
 shoot of the Aldborough-Ribchester    
 routeway, and probably used mainly    
 as a "salt road" in Medieval times -  
 Saltergate Hill lies a mile outside   
 our block on the A59.                 
   Although in a rural area, the road  
 carries a large volume of commercial  
 traffic. Accidents occur too frequent-
 ly, caused mainly by the long, fast   
 A59 cut regularly by N/S intersections
 combined with extreme weather         
 conditions.
