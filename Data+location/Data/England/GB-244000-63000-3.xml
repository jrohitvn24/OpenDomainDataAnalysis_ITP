		<title>03SALT MARSHES</title>
		<content>   While at Bere Ferrers investigating 
 things for our Domesday project,we    
 visited the Salt Marshes at Thorn     
 Point.We knew this area would be      
 unlike any other.                     
   By the Salt Marshes there were a    
 great many things to discover.We found
 three rabbit holes in a bank.Also,upon
 the marshes,there were a lot of dead  
 crabs.We think that they were dropped 
 by seagulls.The gulls eat the inside  
 part and then drop the inedible shell.
   Growing by the salt marshes were    
 some very rare Black Cherry trees.Bere
 Ferrers is famous for these special   
 trees.They provide a rare fruit and a 
 very pretty blossom.                  
   The water in the marshes has a high 
 salt content.We did an experiment at  
 school to show this by comparing it   
 with river water.                     
                                       </content>
