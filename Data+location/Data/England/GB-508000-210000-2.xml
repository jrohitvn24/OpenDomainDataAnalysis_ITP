		<title>02CHARLOTTE'S SATURDAYS</title>
		<content>   On Saturdays I wake up at 7.30 a.m.I
 get dressed and go downstairs for my  
 breakfast.For my breakfast I have Rice
 Pops,toast and marmalade and I have a 
 drink of fresh orange.As I step out of
 the door to go to {St.Albans Market}a 
 burst of sunlight comes through the   
 door.                                 
   I go by car to the Market and we    
 park in the {Multi Storey Carpark}.I  
 look around the Market and buy the    
 things that I would like.They have    
 wool stalls,sweet stalls,cheese       
 stalls,material stalls and lots of    
 other interesting stalls.Then we would
 go back to the{Multi Storey Carpark.} 
 .Then we pay the man for how long we  
 have been there and then we drive     
 home.                                 
{ }Once home I go out to play until    
 1.00 p.m.I come in for lunch and I    
 have{Fish and Chips.}                 </content>
