{       }The area consists of a mixture
 of different types of dwellings. {    
{FLATS} There are no high rise flats.  
 There are still some maisonettes and  
 there used to be some large family    
 houses. Serious mistakes were made    
 when these were first built and they  
 are now being knocked down or altered.
{BUNGALOWS }New bungalows are being    
 built in Speke for Senior Citizens    
 and Disabled persons. When they       
 altered the large family houses which 
 had three storeys they made some of   
 them into two storey houses and many  
 of them into attractive bungalows     
{FARMHOUSES }There are still a few     
 farmhouses on the Hale side of our    
 area. Some of them are still used as  
 farmhouses whilst others have been    
 converted into cottages.
