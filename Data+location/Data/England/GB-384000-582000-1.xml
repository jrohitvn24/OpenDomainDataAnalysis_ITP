		<content>  The area stretches from the edge of  
{Bellingham}village to the hamlet of   
{Redesmouth}about two miles away and   
 from the{River Tyne}to moorland in the
 north.                                
  The land around is mostly{farmland   
 with large stretches of rough grazing 
 and{moorland.}The outer section of the
 village contains some the oldest and  
 the newest housing,and of course the  
 first and middle schools also used as 
 a centre for adult and youth          
 recreational activities.              
  Running through the section is the   
{old railway}line a former link to the 
 outside world.Although now well served
 with minor roads the severe winters   
 can leave the village cut off from its
 neighbours.A pleasant quiet{rural     
{location}appealing to many people for 
{holidays,retirement}or{country living.
