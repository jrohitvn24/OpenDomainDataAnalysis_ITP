		<title>10ST HIERITHA CHURCH</title>
		<content> CHITTLEHAMPTON CHURCH-St Hieritha or  
 to use the more correct form St Urith.
 Her legend closely resembling that of 
 St Sidwell of Exeter is given in the  
 Latin hymn discovered in 15th century 
 manuscript at Trinity College         
 Cambridge in 1901. Little known about 
 her life. There is an ancient figure  
 of her on the pulpit. She was perhaps 
 a convert of St Kea St Fili and St    
 Rumon missionaries from Glastonbury   
 who came here in the 6th century.     
 Westcote(b.1567) speaks of            
 Chittlehampton as a village famous for
 St Hieritha whose miracles are able to
 fill a whole legend who lived there   
 and was buried there. The inscription 
 painted in 1764 on the empty niche by 
 her shrine shows that her name was    
 then still revered. Risdon(1630) says 
 she was born at Stowford. Celebrations
 for St Hieritha are on 8th July.      </content>
