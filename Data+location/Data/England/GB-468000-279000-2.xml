		<content>  Clipston village dates back to the   
Domesday Book itself when it was known 
as Clippeston.  Many old houses have   
been demolished to make way for newer  
developments.  However, there are some 
original dwellings that have been      
modernised in more recent years.  The  
layout of the roads in the village is  
almost the same as nine centuries ago. 
  The population is 470, living in     
mainly privately owned houses.  The    
village comprises of approximately 140 
private properties and 42 Council      
owned, 12 of which have now been sold  
off to private ownership. A survey     
within the village provided the        
following information: The west of the 
village has 31 old and 35 new          
properties. The east has 25 old and 42 
new properties.  The High Street has 18
old and 5 new. Any property over 50    
years was classed as old.              </content>
