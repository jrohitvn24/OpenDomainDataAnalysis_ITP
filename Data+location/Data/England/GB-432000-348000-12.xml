		<title>12The Mill at Belper</title>
		<content>    The first{Mill}was built in 1776 by
{Jedediah Strutt}and{Richard Arkwright.
 Strutt built houses for his workers   
 and the community grew rapidly with   
 the mill. It was water-powered and the
 wheels built up to 500 h.p. The stone 
 arch over the road dates from 1800    
 and the square red brick mill from    
 1912. A modern synthetic processing   
 plant was built in 1964.The former    
 Strutt Mill is now English Calico.    
    {Belper River Gardens}are on the   
 banks of the{River Derwent}and there  
 are rowing boats for hire. There are  
 benches looking over the river.The    
 Gardens are very pretty and very well 
 looked after.There are rhodedendrons, 
 rose bushes and willow trees which    
 overlook a big pond.There are 3 small 
 islands on the pond and an oriental   
 bridge.There is a bandstand where a   
 Brass Band plays in the Summer.       </content>
