		<title>03Local news, Stickney.</title>
		<content>   An exibition was held at the new    
 village hall in Stickney in April     
 1985.A man organised the exibition    
 about the history of Stickney.He      
 had drawn and written everything.It   
 was very interesting there.           
   Most of the local news is concerning
 the church.Some of it is about the    
 annual parochial church council       
 meetings where a group of people go   
 and discuss future events.            
   Last week there was news of the     
 T.Y.E.group.This is a group of young  
 people who talk and do things for the 
 church and raise money for appeals.   
   They try to help in the best way    
 possible.Some of the local            
 parishioners have joined the Rev J.R  
 Worsdal to help dig a trench to enable
 the water to be laid on to the church.
