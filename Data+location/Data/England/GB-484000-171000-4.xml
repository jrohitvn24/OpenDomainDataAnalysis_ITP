		<title>04BINFIELD PARK HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Binfield Park was built in 1775 and   
 was a private residence until it      
 became a home for mentally handicapped
 adults in 1948.                       
 It can accomodate 50 residents, mostly
 from Berkshire, aged between 20 and   
 40.                                   
 Most residents are able to go out on  
 their own but some need supervision.  
 On a typical day the residents wake at
 7.00am, wash, dress and make beds     
 before breakfast at 7.45. Transport   
 arrives at 8.30am to take most of them
 to adult training centres, where they 
 stay from 9.00am to 4.00pm. They have 
 tea between 5.00pm and 6.00pm.        
 Afterwards they enjoy various         
 activities, Art, Reading, Writing,    
 Swimming &amp; Local Walks. There is a    
 Youth Club with sporting facilities.  
 They are generally in bed by 10.00pm.
