		<title>04Arable Farming</title>
		<content> Arable farming predominates in this   
 area.A variety of arable crops are    
 grown.Recently Oil Seed Rape has been 
 very popular(producing oil for        
 margarine).Cereal crops               
 predominate,mainly wheat and barley.  
  Potatoes and sugar beet were in great
 evidence particularly on the Weald    
 Moors at Eyton where a lot of land    
 improvements have taken place         
 including drainage and uprooting      
 hedges to make larger fields.In some  
 cases ten or more fields have been    
 turned into one making it possible to 
 use very large farm machinery.Eyton   
 Estates own one of the largest        
 tractors in this country.Heavy use of 
 artificial fertilizers and irrigation 
 enable peaty soils to produce large   
 yields.Oats peas and maize are grown  
 on a smaller scale with maize as      
 winter feed.                          </content>
