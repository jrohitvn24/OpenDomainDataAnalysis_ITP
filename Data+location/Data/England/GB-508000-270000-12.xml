		<title>12HOUSING IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>   The majority of the houses date from
 the present century and are built of  
 brick with tiled roofs.   Clustered   
 around the Green at Stow Longa are    
 several sixteenth century cottages,   
 with timber frames and thatched roofs,
 while Stow Cottage, on the outskirts  
 of the village, is another attractive 
 house from the same period.           
   Most houses are privately owned, but
 Stow Longa has two groups of council  
 houses, some now owned by their former
 tenants.   Some of the farm cottages  
 in the area are still occupied by     
 agricultural workers, while others are
 rented by private tenants, including  
 servicemen from U.S.A.F.Alconbury.    
   Property in Stow Longa is expensive 
 by Cambridgeshire standards, and young
 married couples can seldom afford to  
 buy houses in the village.
