		<title>15The Railway.</title>
		<content> The Railway came to Bruton in 1856.   
 Bruton Station was built on part of   
 the field called  Hyde, and to carry  
 the old bridle path across the railway
 track, a bridge was built over it at  
 the east end of the platform.  This   
 bridge was pulled down in 1956.       
 Originally called the Wilts, Somerset 
 and Weymouth Line, the Grea Western   
 Railway (as it became) altered the    
 scenery around Bruton and made the    
 town more accessible.  Trains still   
 stop at Bruton, through not quite so  
 regularly as they used to.  Little of 
 the original station now remains,     
 since the old station buildings were  
 replaced with metal shelters some ten 
 years ago, whilst about two years ago 
 the orginal signal box was pulled down
 and all that remains is a pile of     
 bricks.
