		<content> We like going to watch football       
 matches because we enjoy watching     
 our favourite team play. Our favourite
 is Manchester United F.C. They won the
 F.A.Cup this season (1984-85). They   
 were fourth in the First Division     
 but were knocked out of the Milk Cup. 
 It's better than watching it on T.V.  
 because you really get the atmosphere.
 Also you can support them better if   
 you are there. Philip has been to one 
 match and I have been to two, and we  
 both enjoyed all of the matches.      
 The only thing I dislike about going  
 to matches is that you have to travel 
 so far.  Also you have to get there   
 very early to get a decent seat.
