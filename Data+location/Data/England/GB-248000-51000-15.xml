		<title>15VICTORIA WHARF DOCKS.</title>
		<content> Situated to the west of the           
 Cattewater and now a hundred years    
 old, this{dock}was originally a       
 quarry                                
 and was constructed out of granite by 
 a team of Irish labourers who took    
 eight years to finish it. 28 people   
 now work at the dock which has 2      
{warehouses}overing over 30000 square  
 feet of ground. On average about 330  
 ships dock in each year.              
      The main commodity is predictably
{China Clay}which is a major export    
 from the south west. The manager would
 prefer to have a larger capacity to   
 accommodate the larger{ships}which can
 carry nearly 4000 tonnes. The dock has
 28 lorries, 5 fork-lift trucks, 2     
 cranes, 10 conveyors and 1 locomotive.
 During the First and Second World Wars
 the dock was used as an American naval
 base.                                 </content>
