		<content>{  The Fosse Boarding Kennels}for dogs 
 lie half a mile off the Fosse Way.    
 The kennels are reached by means of a 
 track, suitable for a Saloon type car,
 truck or Range Rover. The kennels are 
 run by a husband and wife team only.  
  {Forty four dogs}can be housed at    
 any one time, in double or single     
 kennels. In the main, the dogs are    
 cared for while their owners are on   
 holiday or working overseas.          
{  Any dog becoming ill}is placed      
 immediately in an isolation kennel and
 the local Veterinary surgeon contacted
 for diagnosis and treatment of the    
 illness. Dog owners are asked to      
 agree to this procedure before they   
 leave their pets at the kennels.      
  {The boarding kennels are open ten   
{months of the year, closing all June  
{and October.
