		<title>13THE M6 MOTORWAY _ PART III</title>
		<content> At Low Hurst,near the Golden Fleece   
 interchange,there is a maintenance    
 depot for the M6 motorway.From here   
 many and varied tasks are regularly   
 performed to keep the motorway in     
 tip_top condition and,therefore,safe. 
 Drains have to be kept clean and clear
 of obstructions,bridges have to be    
 systematically inspected,electrical   
 equipment illuminating the motorway   
 signs needs checking,cat's eyes must  
 also be looked at and the flashing    
 warning signals must be kept          
 operational at all times.The biggest  
 problems occur in winter when ice and 
 snow appear.The 6 men employed here   
 have to be smart and get the salt down
 BEFORE the ice forms.Clearing snow is 
 also a problem and this depot has a   
 gritter_cum_snow_plough capable of    
 carrying 11.5 tons of salt and moving 
 at over 30mph.                        </content>
