 These games are all played in the     
 girls yard at West Sleekburn Middle   
 School.  Tug means to touch.          
                                       
{Nash}-This game is similar to Hide and
 Seek except that when the person who  
 is counting finds a person they have  
 to 'tug' them.                        
                                       
{Granny's Shop}-The person who starts  
 the game must think of something a    
 shop sells and say{"My granny owns    
{a sweet shop and in it she sells BB." 
 One of the others must run up and try 
 to guess what it is.If they succeed   
 they are on.
