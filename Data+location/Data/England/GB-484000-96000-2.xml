		<content>     Most of the land here is flat. It 
 was once under the sea. That is why it
 is fertile. The soil is mainly silty  
 loam over clay. The climate is good.  
 The flat land is mostly divided into  
 fields with hedges of hawthorn,       
 brambles,holly,hornbeam,oak and other 
 trees. Most of the trees are          
 windswept.                            
     Rabbits,hares,foxes,weasels,grey  
 squirrels,mice and rats,moles,        
 pheasants,plover,lapwing and barn owls
 are all a common sight.               
     About a third of the area is a    
 harbour which is a nature reserve. It 
 is mostly mud flats at low tide. Birds
 come looking for food. There is very  
 little pollution from the sea but     
 swans have been killed by sewage      
 coming in.
