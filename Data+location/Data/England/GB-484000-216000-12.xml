		<title>12Dairy Farming</title>
		<content>                                       
     The majority of dairy farming in  
our area is of a very high standard.   
There are two different kinds of cows, 
dry cows and wet cows.Dry cows are     
cows that don't give milk because they 
are pregnant.  Wet cows are cows that  
are not pregnant and give milk.        
     Although lots of milk is produced 
much of it does'nt pass the lips of    
many people in our area.Some of it is  
collected by milk tankers and          
transported to other places.           
     Dairy farms in our area include   
,Thistle Brook  Folly,Church,Cane      
End and Baileys farm.Church and Cane   
End farms are in Hulcott near          
Bierton.Some farms have sheep as well  
but don't breed them as they breed     
cows.
