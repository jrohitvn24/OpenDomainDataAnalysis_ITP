		<title>05Place-names around Pencombe</title>
		<content> Many of the modern farm place-names   
 are recognisable in their 14th c.     
 form. Pencombe comes from OE{pen}and  
{cumb}meaning enclosure in the valley  
 of the 'muddy' Lodon. 14th c. Castell 
 appears to have been an area now part 
 of the Nash with a rectangular moated 
 site, Fishpool Croft, and Tump        
 Hopyard, possibly the site of an      
 earlier minor motte. Collier's        
 Coppice, the charcoal burners'        
 coppice; Sparrington, an enclosure in 
 a wood; Wootton, the homestead by a   
 wood; and Hennerwood, the wood on the 
 high ridge, all indicate woodland.    
 Hegdon may be hay hill, Grendon, a    
 green valley and Hundreds Meadow is on
 the hundred boundary. Church House was
 Churchyard in 1344 and legend tells   
 that Bodenham buried its dead from the
 plague there. Few names appear to be  
 Welsh despite Pencombe's proximity.   </content>
