		<title>20SPORT &amp; LEISURE IN SKEGNESS</title>
		<content> Skegness does not have a sport or     
 leisure centre although the residents 
 have been asking for one for many     
 years.We do have a very good outdoor  
 swimming pool but this has problems.  
 The pool loses money even in the      
 summer time because the staff have to 
 be paid even if the pool is not busy. 
 The pool closes in the winter time and
 so the residents must travel 23 miles 
 to Louth or Boston to swim.In 1983 the
 Embassy Centre was opened.This is a   
 conference and theatre centre.It      
 attracts money to the town by         
 attracting business conferences.It    
 also stages shows during the summer.In
 this way it provides some necessary   
 facilities.However many residents feel
 that the money used to build the      
 Embassy should have been put towards a
 sports and leisure centre for the     
 town.                                 </content>
