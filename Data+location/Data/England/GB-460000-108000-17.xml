		<title>17Survey of North Boarhunt</title>
		<content> A small survey of North Boarhunt      
 showed that there is an even balance  
 between the sexes and the trend is    
 towards an ageing population. It was  
 apparent, however, that young families
 are attracted to the area.            
{The residents have lived in North     
{Boarhunt on average between l5 and    
{3O years.}One resident had lived there
 all her 85 years.                     
 Properties vary in age. Some are as   
 much as lOO years old. These older    
 properties tend to be owner occupied, 
 whereas the newer houses are council  
 owned. Occupations among residents are
 varied. They include building workers,
 shop assistants and forestry workers. 
 The car is the most popular mode of   
 transport. Only relatively short      
 distances were travelled to work.     
 Local shopping was done in Fareham,   
 Portsmouth or Waterlooville.          </content>
