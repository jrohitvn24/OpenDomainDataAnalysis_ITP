		<title>14PLAISH COTTAGE COMPLEX</title>
		<content>                                       
    There is a very attractive complex 
 of stone buildings surrounding a      
 cobblestoned courtyard in the wooded  
 hamlet of Plaish. Most of these       
 buildings were originally estate      
 workers cottages for the Elizabethan  
 Manor House - Plaish Hall. Now two    
 sides of this square have been        
 converted into one house,one side is  
 still the original stables and the 4th
 side is a terrace of 3 cottages. These
 fell into disrepair,then were restored
 for holiday letting but are now       
 privately owned. Many 100-year old elm
 trees surrounding Plaish Cottage have 
 now succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease,   
 opening up a view of Bowman Hill      
 Coppice and the trout pool in the     
 Hughley Brook running through the     
 valley.
