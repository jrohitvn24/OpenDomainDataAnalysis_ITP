		<title>02A house</title>
		<content> One house is a large, red bricked     
 building. It has a green door and     
 green window frames. There is a       
 new glass porch in front of the door  
 and even though it is new, it is in   
 need of a clean.}The family, who live 
 inside, are{Scottish}and they miss    
 Scotland badly. They have four boys   
 and a grandmother, they make the house
 a litlle messy at times and the       
 parents find it very expensive to buy 
 food for them all today. The father,  
 works in a sweet shop and the mother  
 works in  a supermarket. Their back   
 garden is small. There is a patio     
 lined with flowers and a grass patch  
 where{the family}sunbathes            
 occasionally. They did have a swing in
 the garden for the young children.
