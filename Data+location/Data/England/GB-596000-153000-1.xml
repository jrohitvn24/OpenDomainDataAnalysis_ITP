		<title>01THROWLEY AND SURROUNDINGS</title>
		<content>   Throwley is on the North Downs about
 100 metres above sea level. Several   
 large dry valleys run North towards   
 Faversham. It is a farming area with  
 mostly arable fields, some pasture and
 deciduous woodland along the valley   
 sides.                                
   There is one small village, a few   
 scattered groups of houses, and about 
 12 farms.The church and school are    
 both outside the village. The roads   
 are not busy but they can be dangerous
 because many are narrow, have numerous
 bends and lack pavements. There is no 
 public transport in the area.         
   Residents must visit Faversham for  
 shopping, public amenities like the   
 library, or to join a club.           
   Many people grow their own          
 vegetables at home. There is  strong  
 community spirit despite the scattered
 nature of the population.             </content>
