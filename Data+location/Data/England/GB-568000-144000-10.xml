		<title>10HOW LAND USE HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content>Land use has changed over the last ten 
years in order to be more productive   
per acre.Many hedges have been         
destroyed to gain acreage.Most farms   
sell more rape and wheat because it is 
more profitable than fruit and hops.   
There are hops in store to last until  
1988.If we grow more we will be over   
the average amount.Farm machinery is   
also very expensive but helps the      
farmer by making his work more         
efficient.When a farm is sold it is    
usually sub-divided as it might be too 
expensive to sell as a whole.Some      
farmers let their land for cattle and  
sheep grazing.The 400 acre Bockinfold  
farm has:-60 acres of fruit and hops.  
50 acres of rape. 40 acres of grass.   
113 acres of winter wheat.             
25 acres of spring barley.             
33 acres of winter barley.
