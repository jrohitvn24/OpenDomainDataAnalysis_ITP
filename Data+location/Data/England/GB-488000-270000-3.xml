  The old Girls Charity School,founded 
in 1712, now a private house, was once 
the home of the Dutch Doll.The         
punishment most dreaded by the children
was to be locked in the cellar with the
doll.She was called the Dutch Doll     
because her hat looked like the Dutch  
National Costume.In fact she probably  
resembled the Charity Girls in their   
uniform.                               
  There are many legends about her,    
one is that her feet were cut off      
because she walked at night.They also  
say that she was fixed to some         
mechanism so that if anybody opened    
the door she moved.                    
  The doll was kept in the church when 
the school moved but it was stolen in  
1981.Local people were angry and upset.
The police still have not traced the   
figure.                                </content>
