		<content> Although I go to bed quite late in the
 evening I usually wake up about 7:00am
 to 7:30am and have breakfast.This     
 gives me plenty of time to get ready  
 for Tennis Club at St.Austell which   
 starts at 10:00am.After I have had my 
 breakfast I usually turn my computer  
 on and play some games on it-"Match   
 Point"which is a game in which you    
 have to beat your opponent at tennis. 
 After this I go to get dressed,I put  
 on my tennis whites,my tracksuit,and  
 my socks and "PUMA" trainers,pick up  
 my raquet,and am driven off to my     
 tennis match.When this is finished I  
 go home to have lunch and finish my   
 homework .I then watch the television 
 until my bedtime.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
