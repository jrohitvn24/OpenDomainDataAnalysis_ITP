		<content> Though there are a number of very old 
properties in Hundon the majority of   
the homes have been built during the   
twentieth century.                     
 During the 1930's a number of         
properties were built by the local     
councils. These houses are still in use
and many have been bought from the     
Council by the residents.  In the      
1970's there was a sudden "rash" of    
building developments in the village.  
This was largely,in my opinion, the    
result of the GLC OVERSPILL  policy.   
The balace of "natives" and "newcomers"
was upset and the atmosphere of the    
village changed together with the      
attitudes.  Many of the new residents  
finding it difficult to accept the lack
of services and amenities. The pattern 
of life is now more settled (1985) with
the discontented having moved out of   
the village again.                     </content>
