		<content> For those seeking softer              
 surroundings,                         
 a small restaurant, "The Winston      
 Churchill" panders to their needs.    
 The restaurant draws people from far  
 and wide, and its situation, secluded 
 behind the village Post Office, does  
 not impinge upon village life.        
 For those travellers who choose a     
 picturesque route to the Lake District
 Winston is a good stopping place. A   
 caravan site with camping facilities  
 has been established.  Again, this is 
 behind the Post Office and is bounded 
 by trees, conserving the village      
 appearance. In summer many new faces  
 are seen in the village.  Numerous    
 cars and caravans from Europe and some
 cycling groups proudly showing their  
 country's flag are seen on the camp   
 site.                                 
                                       </content>
