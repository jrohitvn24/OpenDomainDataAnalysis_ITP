 facilities left at Rasen although

 from Immingham refineries. Buses      
 connect the town with Lincoln and

 the area give good routes to          
 Humberside (including the Humber      
 Bridge) in the N., and Lincoln ,East  
 Anglia and Nottingham in the S.(A46); 
 and Yorkshire and the N. and the east
