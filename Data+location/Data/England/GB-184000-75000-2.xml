{A CURSED FIELD }On Harlyn Farm, above 
 Harlyn Bay, is a field known as Green 
 Close Meadow.  A fishwife who lived   
 nearby is said to have cursed the     
 field, so that the eldest son of      
 anyone ploughing the field would die. 
 It is uncultivated to this day.       
{SHIP WRECKING }Tom Parson's Hut stands
 on the south side of Booby's Bay. Its 
 one-time occupant was a wrecker who,  
 legend says, tied a lantern to the    
 tail of a donkey, leading the animal  
 along the clifftop, the swaying light 
 misleading ships' captains into       
 thinking that here was an hospitable  
 port.  The cottage has been acquired  
 by the National Trust. Booby's Bay is 
 on the west side of Trevose Head.
