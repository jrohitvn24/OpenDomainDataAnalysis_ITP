		<content> Hopskotch  is a game you can play with
 any amount of players.Every player    
 needs a stone and one child needs a   
 piece of chalk.A hopskotch is one     
 square on the first line,the second   
 line has 2 squares and so on until    
 there are ten squares. You put one    
 number in each square and that is the 
 drawing of the hopskotch completed.

 stone and its got to land on the first
 square then you jump over the first   
 square and land on square 2 and 3.And 
 do that all the way down the line.
