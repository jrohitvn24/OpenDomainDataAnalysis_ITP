		<content> In the village of West Tytherley there
 is a {Vineyard }owned by Mr. and Mrs. 
 Donald.They have just under 6000 vines
   Their grapes are German white and   
 they have a small trial of red grapes 
 that seems promising. In a year they  
 fill about 6700 bottles. After the    
 grapes are picked, they are crushed in
 a big machine that came from France.  
 To clear the wine, it is filtered.Next
 it is stored in three big drums where 
 it is left for a year. The bottles are
 green.The corks are supplied from     
 London.                               
     Wine is sold to South Africa,the  
 USA, France, Germany and Australia.
