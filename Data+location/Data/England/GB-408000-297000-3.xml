		<content> There are very few ethnic minority    
 groups,consequently languages other   
 than English are seldom if ever heard.
 Because of the residential nature of  
 the area, the people who live here    
 have frequently moved into the        
 district, almost always for           
 occupational reasons.There is also    
 much fluidity of movement , both in   
 and out of the area, thus a variety of
 regional accents and dialects can be  
 heard, although these have inevitably 
 been modified by the use of so called 
 standard English as heard on the      
 television and the radio. The         
 Birmingham accent which is associated 
 with the Black Country dialect is not 
 popular with many people because it is
 not as socially acceptable as other   
 regional variations in speech and     
 vocabulary and a great many parents   
 and schools actively discourage it.   </content>
