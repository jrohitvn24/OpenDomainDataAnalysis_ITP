		<title>08A farm worker in Breamore</title>
		<content> I am eighty-four and I've never known 
 any other home. My wife isn't         
 Breamore-born,though. She's from Hale 
 and that makes her a foreigner.People 
 often ask me what Breamore was like   
 when I was a lad.I always said that it
 didn't look much different but there  
 were lots more folk out and about,    
 working on the estate and in the      
 village.We didn't have the machines   
 that you have today.People had bigger 
 families ,too.These days, the young   
 folk don't stay in Breamore.          
 I like to work out of doors,unless the
 weather is bad.The garden is important
 to the wife and me.We don't buy any   
 vegetables or fruit and the villagers 
 around here say my potatoes are second
 to none.It's funny to think that      
 growing things could be such a        
 pleasure.I guess you can't change the 
 habits of a lifetime.                 </content>
