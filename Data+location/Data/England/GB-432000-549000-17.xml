		<content> Houghton-Le-Spring is 6 miles south   
 west of Sunderland &amp; 6 miles north    
 east of Durham.The A690 is an         
 important road for the town as it     
 gives quick access to Sunderland,     
 Durham &amp; also the A1M and A19 &amp; the   
 main line railway services.There are  
 also good roads to Chester-Le-St.     
 B1284 &amp; A1052,Seaham B1404 &amp;          
 Washington.The A182 is also important 
 as it links Washington &amp; Peterlee with
 the A19 involving Tyneside, Teeside &amp; 
 North Yorkshire.There is a frequent   
 bus services through the town which   
 links it with all the larger local    
 towns.Opposition to the siting        
 of the bus station has been partly    
 overcome by a reintroduction of       
 services into Newbottle street.There  
 are at present plans to close the bus 
 station &amp; relocate the terminus in the
 Broadway.                             </content>
