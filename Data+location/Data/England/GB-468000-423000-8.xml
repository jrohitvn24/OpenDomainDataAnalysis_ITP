		<title>08A FANTASTIC DAY AT BRID</title>
		<content> On one Saturday we got up at 8.30am   
 because our family was going to Brid. 
 I got dressed and went downstairs for 
 my breakfast and then I brushed my    
 teeth. At 9.30 we set off and         
 eventually we got there at approx     
 11am. Me and my brother went on the   
 bumper boats in the water and I got   
 wet through. We went in a cafe for our
 dinner. After our dinner we went on   
 the big slide for ten minutes and then
 we went on the beach and I put my     
 trunks on and went into the sea with  
 my rubber life ring. By now it was    
 3.45 and we went to the amusements for
 half an hour and then we set off home.
 When we got home we had our tea and I 
 went out to play.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
