		<title>08LONG ASHTON CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> The Long Ashton Carnival was first    
 held in 1980. Carnival day is when the
 whole village can have fun, joining in
 the Carnival and watching as it       
 parades through the streets. The      
 floats have many different themes,    
 like Walt Disney characters, kings,   
 like Henry VIII, or fairy-tale        
 characters, like Hansel and           
 Gretel,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
 or Peter Pan. The floats are placed on
 lorries or vans. If you don't want to 
 go on a float you can dress up and    
 walk around, sometimes collecting     
 money for charity. After the parade   
 the floats return to the village hall 
 to be judged. Then later at night     
 there is a Carnival Dance where you   
 dress up as anything you want and have
 a good time.
