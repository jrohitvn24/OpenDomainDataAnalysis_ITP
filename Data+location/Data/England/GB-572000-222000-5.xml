		<title>05Medical Care in Braintree</title>
		<content>    Braintree is the centre for this   
 area, residents from Bocking and Rayne
 having to travel into the town for    
 treatment.                            
    The area boasts good cover for     
 Doctors and Dental surgeries but one  
 must realise that these facilities    
 found in the centre of town have to   
 deal with the population of the       
 surrounding villages. This therefore  
 reduces the overall care slightly.    
    Hospitals are present with both    
 Julian Coutauld and Saint Michaels.   
 Outside this area is Black Notley     
 Hospital. All three of these are small
 non casualty departments often staffed
 by the local doctors. The nearest     
 casualty department is to be found at 
 Broomfield Hospital near Chelmsford.
