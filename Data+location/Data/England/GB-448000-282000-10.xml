		<content> Farming provides the main employment  
 in the block.There is also a Fuchsia  
 Nursery in Willey village it has over 
 400 varieties.                        
 Bitteswell Airport provides some      
 employment which could increase in the
 future.                               
 There is also the pub in Willey &amp; the 
 motel on Watlihg Street.              
 Many teenagers need to find work away 
 from the area as farming is needing   
 less employees as it becomes more and 
 more mechanised.                      
 Adjacent to the Airport is a modern   
 firm called 'Semelab' who check       
 electrical equipment,especially       
 silicon chips,for faults.
