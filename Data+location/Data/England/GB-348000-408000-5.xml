		<title>05Description of Newburgh</title>
		<content>        Newburgh is a very pleasant    
 rural settlement. It lies on either   
 side of the A5209 which leads to the  
 M6 at Wrightington and is frequently  
 used by heavy vehicles.               
        The population is 1125 with    
 only a few local employers _ a chicken
 factory, a fruit farm, mushroom farm, 
 and a garden nursery. These jobs give 
 an indication of the rural nature of  
 the area.                             
        There is one public house, the 
 'Red Lion'.There is a hairdresser's, a
 village grocery shop and a shop       
 selling riding equipment.             
        There is one Church of England 
 church and a primary school that has  
 70 pupils at the moment. Children of  
 secondary school age are bussed into  
 neighbouring areas, mainly Burscough  
 and Ormskirk.
