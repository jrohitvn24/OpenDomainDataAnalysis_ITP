		<content> t. Botolphs church was built as a pil-
 rim church on the ridgeway for the    
succour of pilgrims travelling to      
Glastonbury. The monks built two       
dormitories now the site of two farm-  
houses. The dues were paid by the      
monks to Beck in Normandy until the    
13th. century when the French were     
dispossed and the property passed to   
the Crown. The Lord Chancellor on      
behalf of the Queen and the Bishop of  
Oxford still appoint the incumbent. It 
has been a parish church since about   
1730. The ecclesiastical parish covers 
Christmas Common, Swyncombe, Russells  
Water and Maidensgrove but excludes    
Pishill. The parish magazine goes to   
all 360 house- holds in the parish.    
Approximately 40 people are regular    
worshippers. No other religion has a   
place of worship in the area. Since    
1833 St. Botolphs has been tractarian. </content>
