		<content>      I live at 'Oaklands Farm',       
 St. Lawrence, it is a 150 years old.  
 We have seventeen cows and the oldest 
 two are about ten years old. I have a 
 cow called 'Stardust' and a calf      
 called 'Superstar' of my own.         
 'Stardust' has won a cup and trophy   
 for being the island champion in the  
 Island Cattle Show. My dad gets up to 
 milk at about 5.45 a.m. in summer and 
 7.00 a.m. in winter. The cows stay out
 at night except when they are calving.
 Nowadays my dad milks by milking      
 machine. During milking they have bran
 nuts as a meal. It helps to stop them 
 kicking. The milk is tipped into a    
 bulk tank and is later pumped into the
 milk tanker lorry and taken to the    
 Dairy at Five Oaks to be processed in 
 to four grades of milk, cream, butter 
 and yoghurt. Jersey milk is very rich 
 and high in butter fat.               </content>
