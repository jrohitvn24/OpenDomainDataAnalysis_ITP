		<content>Shareshill,Saredon and Calf Heath is a 
predominantly farming area with eleven 
farms and several smallholdings.All the
farms are family owned,some having been
in the family for several generations. 
Five of the farms are classed as stock 
farms,breeding beef cattle and sheep   
for the cattle markets.There is no     
longer any dairy farming in the area,  
due mainly to stringent hygiene        
controls and regulations imposed by the
government and the E.E.C. Wheat and    
barley are the main crops grown but oil
seed rape is becoming popular due to   
cash subsidies given by the E.E.C.     
Silage is cultivated on the stock farms
to provide winter feed for the animals 
who are housed in large barns in       
adjoining fields.Treated sewage is used
to improve the  yield.
