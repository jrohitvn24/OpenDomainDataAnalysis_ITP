 WOOLLY HEADED FOREST SHEEP            
 YOU'VE GOT MORE RIGHTS THAN I         
 YOU CAN WANDER WHERE YOU PLEASE       
 WHERE I MUST PASS ON BY.              
   YOU CAN'T BE HALF AS STUPID         
   AS YOU DO FIRST APPEAR              
   'CAUSE NO ONE EVER BOTHERS YOU      
   OR SO IT DOES APPEAR.               
 IF YOU LIE DOWN IN THE ROAD           
 AND HAVE YOURSELF A SLEEP             
 NO ONE EVER MOVES YOU ON              
 'CAUSE YOU ARE FOREST SHEEP.          
   YOU DON'T WORK TO GET YOUR BREAD    
   YOU DON'T RISE AT SEVEN             
   IF I WAS FREE AS YOU ARE FREE       
   I'D THINK I WAS IN HEAVEN           
 WOOLLY HEADED FOREST SHEEP            
 I WISH I WAS ONE TOO                  
 THEN I COULD WANDER THROUGH THE WOODS 
 SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOU.                </content>
