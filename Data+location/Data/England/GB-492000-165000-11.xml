		<title>11SUNNINGDALE SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> There is a wide variety of shops      
 which,like any village sell products  
 which range from clothes to           
 vegetables.There are also restaurants,
 pubs,garages,banks and quite a few    
 other amenities.Many people from the  
 county of Berkshire shop in this      
 village for vital foodstuffs,fashion  
 wear etc.To find out more a survey was
 carried out among 100 shoppers.It was 
 found that most visitors came by car  
 and used the large car park.Nearly all
 the visitors came to buy food but the 
 banks,hairdresser and Post Office were
 also popular.                         
 Most of the local people thought it   
 was a good shopping centre but a bit  
 pricey.They also seemed satisfied with
 the other facilities of the area,such 
 as schools,doctors,dentists and places
 of worship.
