		<content> Situated about 1/2 a mile along the   
road to West Haddon,the park is open   
all the year round.It opened in 1971   
with a few private pets and now has 400
animals and birds.The livestock        
surround the attractive Regency style  
house,parts of which date back to the  
18th century.When the village was      
enclosed in 1746 the Grange was the    
centre of a 350 acre estate.Between    
1870 and 1939 the estate was occupied  
by keen hunting folk needing           
accomodation in the Pytchley Hunt area.
Like many country houses the           
Grange was taken over by the army in   
WW2.The charming stableyard now        
contains the Kalli picture exhibition, 
Tea rooms and a gift shop.Exhibits now 
include big cats,deer,water fowl,birds 
of prey,seals,monkeys,otters and       
parrots.
