On the 12th June 1985, a few children  
went on a farm visit with Mrs          
Prettyman When we got out of the car,  
we heard dogs barking. Then, Mr. Flatt 
showed us some geese. There were four  
geese in one field. In another field   
was one goose with three goslings that 
were two and a half weeks old. There   
were 44 cows on the farm, along with a 
donkey called Polo and a horse called  
Goldie. There are lots of wild rabbits 
in the fields. Later we saw a grain    
pit and were shown how it worked. We   
had a walk in a sugar beet field and a 
walk in a wheat field where we were all
given a piece of wheat.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
