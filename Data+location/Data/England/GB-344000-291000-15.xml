		<content>   There are lots and lots of things to
 do in Church Stretton such as         
 mini-golf, tennis, bowls, shopping,   
 gliding, discos,  bird watching,      
 walking on hills, swimming and lots   
 more. The golf, bowls and tennis is   
 done in Church Stretton park and      
 shopping is easy because there is     
 nearly every thing you need like      
 D.I.Y, clothes and food shops.        
   There are lots of clubs like cubs on
 Tuesday, with lots of games like ping 
 pong hockey and stuck in the mud.     
 Youth club is on Mondays. There is    
 table tennis, pool and darts to play. 
 This costs nothing at all apart from  
 drinks and food.                      
   There are also football, badminton, 
 keep-fit, yoga, cricket, indoor bowls,
 and archery clubs, together with WI,  
 photography, chess, musical groups and
