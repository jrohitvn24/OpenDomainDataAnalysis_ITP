		<content>   One long-standing business at{      
{Ibstock}is that of the Page family,   
{watch-makers and jewellers.}Founded in
 1914 by his father, it is presently   
 run by Mr Ronald Page and his son     
 Keith.                                
   Although many traditional methods   
 are followed, the business has changed
 with the advent of the{micro-chip}and 
 digital watches.                      
   There are electronic machines to    
 regulate time-pieces and assist with  
 fault-finding, whilst clock parts are 
 now cleaned with ultra-sonic sound    
 waves being passed through fluid. Some
 tasks, however, like wheel-making, are
 still carried out on an original      
 machine made by the founder.          
   The main income of the business is  
 from repairs of time-pieces and       
 jewellery. The selling of these items 
 is secondary.                         </content>
