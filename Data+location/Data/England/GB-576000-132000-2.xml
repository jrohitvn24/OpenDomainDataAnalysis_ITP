		<title>02BENENDEN WEALD, AMENITIES.</title>
		<content> This block of grid squares must be one
 of those with the least amenities     
 within 40 miles (65 km) of Charing    
 Cross. It is served by only three bus 
 services and some of these run only on
 a weekly basis, and the pubs and shops
 lie tantalisingly just outside the    
 grid lines. Informal roadside selling 
 is a marked feature of even the       
 Nineveh Lane. Some "shops" are small, 
 just a table with a few garden flowers
 or vegetables, others are larger      
 selling fruit, eggs and dairy produce.
 There is not much pick-your-own as so 
 many people have productive gardens   
 and, because the roads cater only for 
 local traffic there is little casual  
 custom.  There is one small factory   
 and a furniture workshop otherwise    
 people work in farming or outside the 
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
