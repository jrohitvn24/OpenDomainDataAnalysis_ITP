 The forge in Chillenden is owned by   
 Mr. Donald Hogston.  He makes his own 
 horse shoes out of twenty foot lengths
 of concave mild steel bars.  He can   
 make up to twenty shoes from one bar. 
 He uses stainless steel nails.  The   
 blacksmith makes shoes for riding     
 schools and business people, who own  
 horses up to twenty miles away. It    
 costs Â£16 to shoe a horse, plus extra 
 money for studs and pads.  The        
 blacksmith also supplies aluminium    
 plates for race horses. He works five 
 and a half days a week and shoes about
 24 horses in that time.  He has an all
 night burner to keep his furnace      
 going.  He is very happy in his work  
 and with life in the small village of 
 Chillenden.
