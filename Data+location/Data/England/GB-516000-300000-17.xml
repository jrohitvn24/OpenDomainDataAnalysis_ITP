		<title>17ASIAN SHOPS IN PETERBOROUGH.</title>
		<content>   Peterborough has a considerable     
 Asian community concentrated around   
 the Gladstone St. area of the city.   
 Here, to meet their daily needs,can be
 found four asian shops. Many of the   
 asian people in the area use these    
 shops. Although the asian shops sell  
 English food, the asians mainly buy   
 asian food. Three of the four shops   
 surveyed were owned and run by asians.
 The main foods sold were spices,      
 curry,halal meat and rice. Halal meat 
 is special because only one           
 person,appointed by the mosque, can   
 slaughter the animals and this is then
 sold to the community. The shops also 
 serve as meeting places for the local 
 community, and every time we went in  
 these shops we found a large group of 
 asians chatting and discussing local  
 events.                               
                                       </content>
