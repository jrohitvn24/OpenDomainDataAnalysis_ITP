		<title>04The Chalfont St Peter River.</title>
		<content>{Landscape}  The banks of the river are
mainly covered with weeds and small    
shrubs.As it flows through the busy    
centre of Chalfont St Peter,it has to  
go underground frequently.We counted   
five bridges in our area.              
{Wildlife}  The only life to be found  
in this part of the river is weeds,    
water insects and water boatmen.In     
Spring frogspawn and tadpoles can be   
found.Watersnails help to purify the   
water by eating the slime on the banks.
{Industry}  In our area along the river
re are only one or two factories which 
include the car manufacturing company, 
Airpell.                               
{Route}  As the Misbourne flows through
our area it roughly follows the A413.  
Where the river is wide,it is only a   
few inches deep but it is about a foot 
deep in the narrower areas.
