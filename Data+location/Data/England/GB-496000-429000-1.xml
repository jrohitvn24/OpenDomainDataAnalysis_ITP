		<content>   Our area does not consist of many   
 steep hills. Instead the hills are    
 gently rolling. Also it does not hold 
 any large areas of water. The land has
 a few farms on it but it has very few 
 amenities.                            
   There are woods in the area which   
 are mainly deciduous, but there are   
 also some coniferous woods. The fields
 are mostly cultivated but there are   
 some left for grazing.                
   The recent buildings are Little     
 Wauldby Farm and some building is     
 going on nearby. The main source of   
 employment in our area is farming.    
   The Wolds Way which is a Public     
 Right of Way goes through some of the 
 farms. The Wolds Way is mainly used as
 a long distance path for walkers,     
 although horse riders do use it.
