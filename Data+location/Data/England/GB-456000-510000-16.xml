		<title>16The High Green,Great Ayton.</title>
		<content> The High Green is one of the main     
 features of Great Ayton.In the centre 
 of the High Green there is a large    
 lime tree over 80 years old.It was put
 there for{Queen Victoria's diamond    
{jubilee}and in 1912 a new coronation  
 seat was put round the tree. On the   
 edge of the Green is the{Friends      
{School}and  before that was built the 
 High Green was used for grazing       
 animals.There are 21 trees on the     
 Green.They include 9 almond trees     
 planted by a former Headmistress of   
  the Friends School.Around the Green  
 there are many cottages with names    
 such as 'Nut Shell''Orchard House'    
 'Hope Cottage'and 'Dixon House'.On    
 June 20th,1985 we visited the High    
 Green ,most people there,16 in all,   
 were picnicing or taking in the sun.  
 The High Green is a popular public    
 place.                                </content>
