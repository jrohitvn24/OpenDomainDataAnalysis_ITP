    The history of Lartington Hall is  
 very interesting. For over 1000 years 
 there has been a settlement near the  
 sight of the present Hall. It first   
 appears in the Doomsday Book as       
 'Lertington' where there were 'three  
 caricatures of land with two ploughs'.
 The original hamlet was believed to be
 in Crow's Wood to the south of the    
 Hall. Robert de Lascelles lived here  
 in 1208 having the land from the      
 Fitchugags of Ravensworth. During the 
 riegn of Elizabeth I it became the    
 royal patronage and the Countess of   
 Devon, of Shrewsbury and the Duchess  
 of Devonshire wrer involved in selling
 the Lartington Manor. Information     
 about the owners of the hall since the
 can be found under the keyword        </content>
