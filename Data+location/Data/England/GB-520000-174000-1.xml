		<title>01       INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>  Our 'square' covers a densely        
 populated area south-west of London,  
 bordered by generous green open       
 spaces. It covers three main          
 neighbourhoods of the London Borough  
 of Richmond-upon-Thames - East Sheen, 
 Barnes and Mortlake.                  
  It is a 'desirable' residential area,
 a fact that is reflected in local     
 property prices. This is due as much  
 to the proximity of natural amenities 
 (Richmond Park is partly in our square
 as are Barnes and Palewell Commons,   
 and Kew Gardens are near), as to      
 the closeness of London: Waterloo is  
 20 minutes by train.                  
  The nearness of TV and other media   
 centres accounts for the many         
 residents involved in such work.      
   The South Circular Road, and        
 Heathrow's flight-path, have some     
 blighting effect on this locality.    </content>
