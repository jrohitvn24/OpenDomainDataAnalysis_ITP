 The collecting and compiling of this  
 survey was made very difficult by the 
 present Industrial Action taking place
 in the schools. The teachers of       
 William Farr School, as everywhere    
 else, in England Scotland and Wales   
 followed their Union's instructions to
 withdraw 'Good-will'. This meant that 
 no meetings could be arranged during, 
 or outside, school hours and no extra 
 work taken on; therefore this         
 enterprise has suffered to some       
 extent. We apologise but we have done 
 our best!
