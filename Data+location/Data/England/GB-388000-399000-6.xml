		<content>    There are many more people living  
 in the area now, and many more cars.  
 Public transport and shopping         
 facilities are much improved. A number
 of supermarkets have been built -     
 Co-op, Morrisons, Liptons plus many   
 other smaller shops.                  
    Although most of the residents     
 interviewed welcome the better        
 shopping and transport facilities, and
 the modernised property, a number of  
 them feel that there is too much      
 litter now, and that vandalism is a   
 serious problem - particularly        
 graffiti on walls. Also, one of the   
 residents interviewed feels that there
 is no community spirit like there used
 to be, and that people in the area    
 were friendlier in the past than they 
 are now.
