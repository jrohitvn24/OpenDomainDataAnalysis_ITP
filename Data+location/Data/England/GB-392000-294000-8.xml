		<title>08Ettingshall linear walk</title>
		<content>The old community of Ettingshall has a 
mixture of industrial and housing land-
cover. There is little open space so   
when the local railway line was closed 
it provided an opportunity to develop  
the ecology of the area.  The tracks   
were taken up,the land covered with    
gravel to make it usable in all        
weathers and a new access was made by  
the building of steps down to the line.
Walking along the new footpath you can 
hardly believe that you are in such a  
densely populated urban area.  Its     
lower location blots out traffic noise.
Birds can be easily seen and heard,    
including Kestrels.  As the old (GWR)  
line here was in a cutting the steep   
sides have been colonised by many wild 
flowers and bushes which make this a   
most pleasant walk and an addition to  
the amenities of the area.
