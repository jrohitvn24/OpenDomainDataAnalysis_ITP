		<title>04WEST MEON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   West Meon has developed in a linear 
 fashion along the north-south and     
 west- east roads. It lacks the        
 traditional village green and pretty  
 centre, but does have a variety of    
 attractive timbered and  terraced     
 cottages. It has grown rather than    
 been planned and at least 50% of the  
 houses are thought to be over 60 years
 old. The most recent housing is a     
 small estate built 6 years ago. There 
 are three very small areas of council 
 housing. The latest was built in 1959.
   A stone cross is situated in the    
 middle of the village, erected by     
 Thorold Rogers, the last surviving    
 child of 16, as a memorial to his     
 parents. The Church and the School are
 19th century and have walls faced with
 knapped (i.e.squared) flints. One of  
 the two pubs is named after Thomas    
 Lord,founder of Lord's cricket ground.</content>
