		<content> Traditions of straw plaiting for Luton
 hats has gone with the visiting fish- 
 monger, the local baker who cooked the
 villagers' pies in his cooling oven   
 and the liver dumplings one end with  
 jam the other for the field workers.  
 There is still an annual Fete on the  
 green, a huge bonfire and fireworks on
 Nov.5th near the well, a Christmas    
 Bazaar and a senior citizens Christmas
 dinner with entertainments. Supposed- 
 ly an escape route from Berkhamsted   
 Castle comes to Grove Farm. There are 
 sandstone caves under the green. One  
 called Cathedral Cave has a deep swift
 under-ground river. Cave climbers are 
 searching for the entrance which was  
 blocked for safety. It is hoped the   
 caves will prove a safe place for     
 people in a nuclear war.Springs rise  
 every 7 years. They flooded in 1914 &amp; 
 1939.                                 </content>
