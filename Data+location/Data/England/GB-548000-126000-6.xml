		<title>06HIGH HURSTWOOD FARMING</title>
		<content> Some former farms are now private     
 homes which have either sold or let   
 land to farmers, but farming, with its
 related trades is still the only      
 industry here and there are ll farms  
 working some 574 ha, 3 dairy, 7 beef  
 and l mixed. 3 farms also have sheep  
 and in winter look after other farmers
 sheep moved up from lower and wetter  
 areas. In addition to grass, some corn
 is grown and a few potatoes. Land     
 values vary from Â£2,500 to Â£4,625 per 
 ha. 3 farms are run as riding or      
 livery stables and the large number of
 horses kept on farms and privately    
 reflects the popularity of riding as a
 recreation. There is one large poultry
 farm with 10,000 layers in battery    
 houses selling eggs direct and to     
 shops in a 25 mile radius. There is   
 also a small unit of rabbits mainly   
 for meat.                             </content>
