		<title>05CLITHEROE'S QUARRY SITE.</title>
		<content>    Salthill Quarry is to be found on  
 the outskirts of Clitheroe. Lime was  
 once the staple trade of Clitheroe and
 the site was originally quarried for  
 limestone for building and industrial 
 purposes. From the early part of this 
 century the quarrying activity has    
 eventually ceased.                    
    In recent years there has been     
 pressure in the town to provide a new 
 industrial area which would not       
 intrude into the surrounding country- 
 side. There was also growing          
 pressure from people with an interest 
 in geology to visit this quarry site. 
 As a result the quarry has been       
 reclaimed and forms the site of a     
 developing industrial estate. At the  
 same time a geological trail has been 
 planned and constructed on this new   
 development.
