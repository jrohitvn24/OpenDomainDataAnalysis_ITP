		<title>14DAILY LIFE IN SALISBURY</title>
		<content> My working day begins with the alarm  
 going off at 6.30am. I crawl out of   
 bed, go downstairs to put on the      
 kettle and radio. Usually I finish    
 washing and shaving by 7.00am, then   
 have my breakfast and sit in the      
 armchair for ten minutes. After a cup 
 of tea I prepare for work and leave   
 home at 7.50am. I go to work at       
 Woodrow's on the nearby Industrial    
 Estate by bicyle or car; I arrive by  
 8.00am. I have a quarter hour break at
 10.30am, go home for dinner from 1 pm 
 till 2.00pm and finish work at 5.00pm.
 After tea I generally watch the news  
 on T.V and occasionally "nod off" for 
 a few minutes. Before going out for a 
 run I do any jobs round the house or  
 on the car. Running helps me to relax 
 after the pressures of a working day. 
 I usually watch a T.V. film or a      
 video. My day ends at 11.30 pm.       </content>
