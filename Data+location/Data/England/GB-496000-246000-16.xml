		<content> People locally are disturbed by the   
 losses of trees and hedgerows, ponds  
 that have been filled in and loss of  
 wildlife habitats.The hedgerows that  
 remain are cropped short and narrow   
 every year (often after harvest)      
 damaged by straw burning and cut by   
 mechanical hedge cutters which prevent
 growth of hedgerow saplings which may 
 have replaced dying trees.Although    
 some efforts have been made at        
 protecting and replacing trees, no    
 new hedges have been planted which    
 would prevent soil erosion, snow      
 drifts on roads, add beauty and       
 variety to the landscape and provide  
 vital wildlife habitats.Footpaths     
 often followed hedgerows and today    
 when the hedge has gone, the path is  
 ploughed and walkers no longer welcome
 to use it.
