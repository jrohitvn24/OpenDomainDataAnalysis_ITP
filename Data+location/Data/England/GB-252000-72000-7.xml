		<content> Moorland rising from 500 feet above   
 sea-level to as much as 1300 feet at  
 King's Tor, covers nearly all the area
 other than the immediate Walkham      
 valley, and is controlled by the      
 Dartmoor National Park. The upper     
 slopes have granite outcrops          
 surrounded by boulders and clitter.   
 The larger rocks, known as Tors, have 
 names  such as Vixen Tor. Its shape   
 resembles an Egyptian Sphinx,         
 particularly if viewed from the       
 Tavistock-Merrivale road. The rock    
 piles of Pew Tor are imposing,        
 offering a fine view of moorland to   
 one side, cultivated country to       
 another and the distant Tamar estuary 
 to another. Close to Heckwood Tor is a
 large worked stone originally intended
 for Plymouth Breakwater but rejected  
 on account of a flaw.
