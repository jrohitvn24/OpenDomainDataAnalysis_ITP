		<title>12Guiding in Purley</title>
		<content>   Every Friday from 6-8pm I go to     
 Guides. The meetings are held at      
 St.Davids, Purley, which happens to be
 my school, but any girl can join as   
 long as they are in the age limit of  
 10-14.                                
   All guides wear the same uniform, a 
 light blue blouse and navy skirt with 
 a special belt and purse. Every       
 different Company wears a coloured    
 scarf. As I belong to the 6th.Purley  
 Company I wear a yellow scarf.        
   Also at guides we go to camp each   
 year. Guides were founded by Lady     
 Baden Powell whose birthday we        
 celebrate on February 22nd and it is  
 called 'Thinking Day'.                
   1985 is the 75th. anniversary of    
 guiding. We are holding a party and   
 competitions  called 'Space 75' at    
 Thomas More School.
