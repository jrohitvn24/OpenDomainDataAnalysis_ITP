 were added on later.The main{Doorway} 
 has old Norman carvings in the stone  
 archway around the edge.Some of these 
 are symbolical christian creatures    
 such as Vulpis the fox,Hiena the Hyena
 and Panthera the Panther.As you enter 
 the church to your left is the Norman{
{Font}.This was and still is used to   
 christen babies.There is a {Virgins   
{crown}which was used when a maiden    
 died.It was carried in front of the   
 body at the funeral procession and    
 afterwards hung in the church.The {   
{Pulpit}is dated 1626 and the wooden { 
{Altar} 1628 .
