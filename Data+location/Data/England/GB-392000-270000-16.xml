		<title>16DODFORD CHURCH, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content>   {Holy Trinity and St. Mary's Church,
{Dodford}was built in 1907-08. The     
 first vicar paid to have it built.    
 Before that, everyone had to go to    
 church in Bromsgrove. The church is   
 built with large blocks of grey stone 
 and cement covered in pebbles. It has 
 plain glass arched windows except for 
 one 30-paned round window. At the base
 of the square tower is a metal door,  
 leading up a spiral staircase to the  
 battlements at the top. There are two 
 bells in the tower.                   
    Around the church is a small grave-
 yard with wild flowers. There is one  
 grave dated 1900, before the church   
 was built. The children from{Dodford  
{First School}often walk to the church,
 to work, or to attend a service. The  
 graveyard contains the graves of some 
 of the children's grandparents and    
 great-grandparents.                   </content>
