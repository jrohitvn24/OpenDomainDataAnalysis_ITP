		<title>02MOVING TO MICKLEY</title>
		<content> I didn't really want to move to       
 Mickley. I wouldn't know anyone and   
 would have to change schools but on   
 the first day I made friends.         
 There are more things to do here and  
 more children to play with. The people
 are very friendly.                    
 I lived in a big city and could not   
 keep a dog but now I can.             
 I like swimming in the river with my  
 friends and dog.                      
 Mickley is nicer because there are no 
 rough boys to pick on you. There are  
 more places to play on roller skates  
 and bikes. I like having riding       
 lessons.                              
 I like living at Mickley and I        
 wouldn't want to move.
