		<title>16A Ghost Story</title>
		<content> It is told in the village that        
 one dark, stormy night, about 100     
 years ago,a farmer had to return over 
 the Holmes,(water meadows near the    
 Trent). He had taken refreshment at   
 the Lord Nelson Inn and he lay dozing 
 on his cart as his horses found their 
 way home. The floods had come up from 
 the Trent, and the horses had some    
 difficulty finding their path. With a 
 curse, the farmer woke and whipped the
 beasts.The horses charged foward,     
 straight into the ox-bow lake (the old
 course of the  River Trent).They were 
 immediately sucked under and were     
 never seen again. Now on dark, stormy 
 nights the cart and horses can still  
 be heard by anyone brave or stupid    
 enough to be over the Holmes.The      
 sounds of the horses screams are still
 carried on the wind to the village on 
 such nights.                          </content>
