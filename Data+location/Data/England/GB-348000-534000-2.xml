		<content>  Most of the Fells in the area are in 
 the NNE part.They rise to a height of 
 271m.As we looked down from them most 
 of the fields in the valley were      
 intensively managed grassland but when
 we looked to the W we could see       
 Caldbeck fells,while in the N we saw  
 England's tallest chimney which is 13 
 miles away at Carlisle.To the SE we   
 could see the Pennines and to the     
 SW,Blencathra 868m.high.              
  Nearly all the houses lie in the     
 valley.They are made of pink sandstone
 quarried from the hills on which we   
 were standing.                        
  The Farm houses in the area are Low  
 Street,Fair Bank,Wood Head,Forest     
 Hill,Mounsey Bank,Holme Head,Low House
 ,Plumpton Head,Boggle Hall,West View, 
 Stoney Beck,Bowscar,Nelson Hill and   
 Plumpton Old Hall.
