  PEN HILL FARM IS WHERE CAROLINE      
 SHORT LIVES.IT IS NOT VERY FAR FROM   
 WERE OUR HOUSE IS,JUST UP THE         
 FARM.THERE IS A LANE WHICH LEADS DOWN 
 TO HER HOUSE.THE HOUSE LOOKS QUITE NEW
 BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD THE HOUSE    
 IS.THEY HAVE A FIELD WITH SOME HORSES 
 IN BY THE SIDE OF THEIR HOUSE.I THINK 
 THAT MOSTLY THEIR LAND IS PASTURE AND 
 THEY KEEP COWS IN SOME OF THEIR       
 FEILDS.ALSO CAROLINES FARM IS A DAIRY 
 FARM AND THAT IS WHERE WE GET OUR MILK
 AND CREAM FROM.
