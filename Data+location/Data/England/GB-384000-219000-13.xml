		<content>   THE SEWAGE WORKS N.E. OF LONGFORD   
 WAS BUILT IN 1938 TO SERVE LONGLEVENS,
 INNSWORTH AND KINGSHOLM. BEFORE IT WAS
 BUILT PEOPLE IN THESE AREAS USED EARTH
 TOILETS.                              
   SEWAGE FROM LONGLEVENS, INNSWORTH,  
 PLOCK COURT AND KINGSHOLM IS TAKEN    
 ALONG PIPES TO THE WORKS. THERE IT IS 
 FED INTO AERATION TANKS TO BE TREATED.
 HERE IT IS ATTACKED BY LITTLE 'BUGS'  
 THAT LIVE IN THE TANKS. THE 'BUGS' USE
 A PROCESS CALLED 'BINICISON' TO REPRO-
 DUCE (1=2=4=8 ETC.)                   
   ONCE THE SEWAGE IS TREATED IT GOES  
 INTO PRIMARY SEDIMENTATION TANKS TO   
 HAVE THE BITS THAT BLOCK UP THE PIPES 
 (NAPPIES ETC.) REMOVED.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
