		<title>11THOLOMAS DROVE</title>
		<content> Until the 1930's Tholomas Drove was a 
 hamlet in its own right,with a fire   
 engine and station, school, shop and  
 post office. Since then the hamlet has
 declined in importance and become an  
 out-post of Wisbech St.Mary.          
 The school building still stands, but 
 is now used as a barn. French Cottage,
 built for the Headmaster, is now      
 occupied by John Brackenbury former   
 landlord of the Bridge Inn.           
 Jubilee Farm, formerly known as Calves
 Field Farm, is now owned by the Ball  
 family. In the 1930's the farm was    
 divided into six fields, growing a    
 variety of crops which were farmed by 
 six workers, but now there is only one
 field farmed by one person.           
 Tholomas Drove was, and still is, a   
 close-knit community comprising mainly
 of the same families generation after 
 generation.                           </content>
