		<content>The area we agreed to survey covers the
two villages of Chevington and         
Hargrave and the hamlet of Knowles     
Green, surrouned mainly by arable      
farms. The largest of the two villages 
is Chevington approx. pop. 600. At     
least 50% of the housing, ranging from 
large detached houses to small terraced
bungalows, were built in the last 20   
years. Consquently the population has  
become younger with a thriving village 
shcool with a register of 57 pupils    
aged 5 to 9.                           
The social life of the village centres 
around the Village Hall with activities
from Playgroup for the under 5's, the  
Womens Institute and the Good          
Companions (over 60's) Club. All ages  
being catered for.                     
Although the majority of the land      
surrouding Chevington is arable. we do
