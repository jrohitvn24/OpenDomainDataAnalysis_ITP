		<title>04THE HUNTING LODGE,COTTINGHAM</title>
		<content>                                       
     The 16th Century Hunting Lodge and
the adjoining Bury House were the home 
of the Masters of the local hunt and   
housed its hounds and horses.          
     About 20 years ago the Hunting    
Lodge was converted into a Restaurant. 
The old hay barn is now the entrance   
hall and the former stables and hay    
loft are now the Restaurant and Lounge 
Bar. The original stable hitching rings
can still be seen in the walls. Bury   
House itself has now been converted    
into residential flats.                
     Some links with the past still    
remain. Thwarted in love, the Ghost of 
Thomas Medlicote, Head Groom in the    
1780's, is said to walk the old stables
at night. The sound of hooves can be   
heard as he leads his horse to a rope  
tied to the rafters where he hung      
himself.                               </content>
