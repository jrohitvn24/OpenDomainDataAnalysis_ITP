		<title>12The Life of a Shepherd</title>
		<content> A{Shepherd's life}in 1985 is a 7 day a
 week job. The year starts in March or 
 April with{lambing}when the day can be
 17 or 18 hours long.  During this time
 he tries to save every lamb that is   
 born. He is helped in this with modern
 medicines and injections which he     
 administers himself. May and June is a
 time of daily feeding and giving the  
 lambs a monthly worming medicine. July
 is{shearing time,}usually done by     
 contract shearers. It is also the time
 when the lambs that are big enough are
 sent to{market.}September is the month
 of{sheep sales}when the smallest lambs
 are sold and replacement{ewes}are     
 bought. The{rams}are put with the ewes
 in October. Feeding and checking in   
 all winds and weathers are the main   
 winter jobs.
