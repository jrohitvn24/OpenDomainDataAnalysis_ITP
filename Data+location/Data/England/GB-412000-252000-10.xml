		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY AROUND GRAFTON</title>
		<content> Most villages have a manor house.  In 
 Temple Grafton it is Grafton Court.   
 The lord of the manor had Temple      
 Grafton school built in 1836 which    
 became the Parish Hall that was later 
 demolished.  The present school was   
 built in 1874, by a later Lord of the 
 Manor.  Binton village school         
 closed in 1957 and is now the village 
 hall.  The Bell Inn (in Welford) is a 
 17th century  building and is facing  
 the small village green.  One of the  
 cottages (Boat Cottage in Boat Lane)  
 was the origanal village inn.         
 Hillborough used to be a large village
 until the plague came.  Then people   
 either died or went away and most of  
 the cottages were left empty and fell 
 into ruin.  In aerial photographs you 
 can still see the marks of the        
 foundations of the cottages in the    
 fields.                               </content>
