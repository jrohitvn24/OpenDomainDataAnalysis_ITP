 granting an Indulgence to anyone who  
 gave money to the Building Fund. In   
 1542, a charter from Henry Vlll       
 established a Saturday market and an  
 annual fair on the Feast of the       
 Assumption, so a Market Hall was built
 in the High Street.By the 17th.       
 century the town had declined; but in 
 the 19th. century the Grand Union     
 Canal revived it.The County Police    
 Force arrived here in 1846 (3         
 constables at Rickmansworth, 3 at Mill
 End and 2 at Batchworth): street      
 lighting in 1852: the railway from    
 Watford by 1862, and the Metropolitan 
 Railway in 1887. A traveller by the   
 first train said that "there were not 
 more than 12 cottages after leaving   
 Pinner" and described Rickmansworth as
 "a straggling street".
