 Gala Day is celebrated each year on   
 Spring Bank Holiday Monday. It began  
 in 1937 after rain had spoiled the    
 celebrations planned for the          
 Coronation of King George Vl. On Gala 
 Day there is a long procession that   
 goes through the town led by a Gala   
 Queen. The Gala Queen is crowned      
 before the procession starts. The     
 parade consists of decorated lorries  
 and groups of people dressed in all   
 sorts of costumes. After the          
 procession everybody goes to the King 
 George's Playing Field, where there is
 a funfair and some stalls. In the     
 evening there is a torch procession   
 and a disco.                          
 Gala Day is a happy day for everyone  
 who lives in Westerham.
