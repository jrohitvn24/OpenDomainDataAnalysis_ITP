		<title>13MOVING OUT OF HIGH HAM AREA</title>
		<content> The village shop does not stock       
 anything in quantity, hence it is     
 used for emergency items only. Most   
 people within the block go to nearby  
 towns to shop,or use the mobile shops.
 We asked 100 people about their       
 shopping habits. Most people travel   
 weekly to Langport (5km), Street      
 (11km), and Somerton (9km) for fresh  
 food. Monthly visits are made to      
 Yeovil (25km), Bridgwater (16km), and 
 Taunton (25km). Food can be bought in 
 bulk in these larger towns, and there 
 is a wider variety of goods on offer. 
 People also travel to these places for
 entertainment and sports facilities.  
 The only recreation facilities within 
 the block are 2 public houses. "The   
 King's Head Inn" at High Ham, which   
 sells only drink, and "The Pound" at  
 Aller where meals as well as drink    
 are served.                           </content>
