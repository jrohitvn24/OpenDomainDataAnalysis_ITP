		<title>01SLOUGH,DATCHET AND ETON</title>
		<content> The area stretches from the riverside 
 at Windsor across to Datchet and      
 northwards to the southern part of    
 central Slough,including Eton.        
   A large proportion of the south is  
 open space,including both the public  
 and private parts of the Home Park    
 adjoining Windsor Castle,the Brocas   
 which are open fields by the river at 
 Eton, and Agar's Plough which are     
 playing fields for Eton College.      
   The land is extremely flat and the  
 noticeable exceptions are the castle  
 in Windsor and the northern area which
 lies on the 1st terrace above the     
 river Thames flood plain.             
   There is a marked contrast between  
  historic Eton and the modern Slough  
 High Street,the quiet lanes and the   
 M.4 motorway with aeroplanes leaving  
 Heathrow Airport to the east.
