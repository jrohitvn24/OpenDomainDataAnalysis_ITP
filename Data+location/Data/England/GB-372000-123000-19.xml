		<title>19SOUTH CHERITON GARAGE</title>
		<content>   South Cheriton Garage is owned by   
 Mr. Franklin.He does mostly repairs as
 he does not have the facilities to    
 carry out M.O.T.s. He has a franchise 
 from Fords to deal in their cars and  
 he does occasionally sell new         
 vehicles.                             
   He probably repairs about 300 - 350 
 cars a year. He does not handle any   
 agricultural machinery. He has a      
 breakdown truck and will go out to tow
 vehicles in.                          
   He has two mechanics working for him
 and has no need for using the Youth   
 Training Scheme.                      
   There has been a garage on this site
 for 33 years. Before that there was   
 wasteland with some pigstyes.         
   Mr. Franklin lives locally and has  
 mainly regular established            
 customers.His trade has steadily      
 improved even during the recession.   </content>
