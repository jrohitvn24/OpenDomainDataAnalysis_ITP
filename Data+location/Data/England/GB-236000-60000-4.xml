		<content> St.Michael's Church was built in 1269 
 and still retains some original       
 stonework.                            
 Normal church services are held on    
 Sundays and special occasions,while   
{Sir Robert Geffery's School}uses it   
 for its own special religious         
 occasions,thus retaining the link     
 between the church and Sir Robert when
 he endowed the school.                
 Congregations average about 45 persons
 weekly,although many more attend the  
 Festivals of Easter,Christmas &amp;       
 Harvest.                              
 The village has expanded considerably 
 over the last ten years and this has  
 shown up in the life of the church    
 with the rise in number of marriages  
 and baptisms.The electoral roll of the
 church contains 160 names.            
 There is no incumbent of the living at
 present.the vicar retired in 1984.    </content>
