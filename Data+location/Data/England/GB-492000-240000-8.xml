		<title>08CRANFIELD INSTITUTE OF TECH.</title>
		<content>   Present activities at the {Institute
 can  be  traced back to 1943 when  the
 Aeronautical  Research  Council    was
 asked  by  the  Minister  of  Aircraft
 Production to study the possibility of
 founding  a  school  of   aeronautical
 science. Subsequently Cranfield,partly
 because of the presence of the        
 airfield was chosen and the{College of
{Aeronautics}( the first of the        
 Institute's  departments )  was  born.
 Prior to the  Institute  the  airfield
 had  opened as a  bomber  base for the
 R.A.F on 1 June 1937.                 
   Today there are over  5,500 students
 attending  the  many  courses run by a
 staff of  1400.  The newest department
 at the Institute - which has  acquired
 university status - is the   School of
 Management, now one of the largest and
 most  respected  business  schools  in
 Europe.                               </content>
