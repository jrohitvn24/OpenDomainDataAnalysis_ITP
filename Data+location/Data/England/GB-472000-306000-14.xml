		<title>14HOME LIFE IN N-E LEICS</title>
		<content>  Most families in the area live a very
 quiet rural way of life with farming  
 activities taking up many hours per   
 day despite modern methods and        
 mechanical aids. Many houses have     
 central heating using either oil or   
 solid fuel. Some rely on open fires of
 logs or coal while others have        
 electric fires. Cooking is by         
 electricity, bottled gas, or solid    
 fuel, with most families having at    
 least one cooked meal a day.A freezer 
 is an essential piece of kitchen      
 equipment with some families freezing 
 their own produce, however most       
 farmers do not have a vegetable       
 garden. All homes have a telephone    
 which is considered essential and mail
 is delivered daily.Post is collected  
 from roadside boxes.                  
 Most families keep pets, cats and     
 dogs being the most popular.          </content>
