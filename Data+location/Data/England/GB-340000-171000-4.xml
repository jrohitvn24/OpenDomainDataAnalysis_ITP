		<content> I think Clevedon is a nice little     
 town to live in because it is not     
 too big or too small.                 
 It has a cricket pitch,football and   
 rugby grounds,tennis courts and a     
 bowling green as well.                
 Clevedon has the Bristol Channel      
 nearby,so that means good fishing     
 and sailing.                          
 The golf club up by Walton Castle is  
 one of the best around.               
 Although they are quite good already, 
 I would like to see even more sports  
 facilities for young people.          
 I can't wait for the new swimming pool
 to be built!                          
 The pier should be good when it is    
 rebuilt-people will use it for        
 fishing,and enjoy walking along it.
