		<title>03YARWELL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Yarwell is a small picturesque       
 village beside the River Nene. It has 
 many old houses made from local stone 
 and Collyweston slate. In the centre  
 of the village is one public house,   
 called The Angel, which is 500 years  
 old but still in good condition. There
 is a post office which serves as a    
 general store as well. The houses are 
 often generous in size, and in a      
 variety of styles, terraced, detatched
 and semi_detached, as well as the     
 attractive stone cottages typical of  
 this area.                            
  Although the village is small it has 
 a lively and active community, and    
 there are several facilities which    
 serve the villagers; the village hall 
 is a centre for these activities,     
 ranging from regular playgroups and   
 discos for the young, to day trips    
 for the old.                          </content>
