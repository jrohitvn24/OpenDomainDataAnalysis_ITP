		<content> Tickhill has had a{Music Society}since
 1977.The first performance was        
 organised by an individual but since  
 then a committee has been formed.In   
 1985 the membership fee is Â£5.50 for  
 the season.The society tries to get   
 famous people to perform for them. The
 music is mainly classical although    
 they have also had Jazz and Indian    
 music.As well as music{lessons}in the 
 schools,there are also a lot of       
 private tutors in Tickhill,mainly for 
 piano but also for cello and guitar.  
 We conducted a survey to see{pop      
 groups/solo artists people at our     
 school prefered.The following results 
 were obtained,Wham46%,Duran Duran16%
