		<title>17Employment, N. Lopham</title>
		<content>      Jobs can be more difficult to    
 find in a village.  There is also a   
 smaller choice of jobs.               
      We did a small survey about work.
  We asked parents of children at N.   
 Lopham school about their jobs and    
 found that, at least, there was no    
 unemployment for our children's       
 fathers - every one had a job.  When  
 we asked mothers, just over 1/3       
 worked, but of these only 1 had full  
 time employment and the rest were part
 time.                                 
      Jobs for fathers included:       
 computer programmer, H.G.V. driver,   
 granary worker, master mariner, sales 
 representative, head pigman.          
      Jobs for mothers included:       
 domestic cleaner, home helper,        
 insurance clerk, typist, shop         
 assistant, general assistant in pub,  
 teacher.                              </content>
