		<content> We estimate the population of our     
 block to be just over 1000.Although   
 the population is now growing,the area
 has less people living in it now than 
 it used to.We know this because older 
 people recall many shops that have    
 closed and houses that have been      
 demolished.In 1903 there were 179     
 children in Stetchworth school.There  
 are now 49 and the school at          
 Woodditton closed two years           
 ago.Stetchworth used to have three    
 public houses.Now it has one.The      
 chairman of the parish council,a      
 farmer,believes the fall in population
 is due to modern farming methods.Use  
 of chemicals has enabled farmers to   
 change from stock to arable.This and  
 mechanisation means there are fewer   
 jobs.Most people now commute to       
 Newmarket or Cambridge.The most common
 occupation is in Building not Farming.</content>
