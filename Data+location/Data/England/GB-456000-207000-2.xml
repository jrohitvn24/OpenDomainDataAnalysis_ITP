		<title>02The New Ice Rink in Oxford.</title>
		<content>                                       
In Oxford there is a new ice rink for  
people to ice skate.It was opened in   
Dec 1984.Our class of 10-11 year old   
children is going skating for 10       
lessons which are special for          
schools.It costs ten pounds.There are  
two instructors for 23 children.The    
instructors are both Canadian.We have  
learned Backwards jumps,Scooters,      
Swivels,T-stops,and Spins.I think ice  
skating is good because I could not    
skate and now I am learning.They play  
ice hockey for a sport and Oxford has  
a team.I think it is a good job we     
have a rink in Oxford because anybody  
can go ice skating and learn to skate. 
It costs 1.65 for One and a half hours 
skating. This includes hiring skates.
