		<title>14MELDON QUARRY</title>
		<content> Meldon Quarry is on the edge of       
 Dartmoor at around 300m above sea     
 level. First opened by the London and 
 South Western Railway it now supplies 
 the southern part of the railway      
 system with ballast to support the    
 track. A single blast will produce    
 some 40000 tonnes of loose rock which 
 is then crushed to various sizes. The 
 ballast is a nominal 50mm, while other
 smaller grits are also produced. Over 
 90% of the output is despatched by    
 rail in five trains a day, each       
 carrying around 1000 tonnes. Some     
 stone is sold locally for road making 
 and building purposes. Recently the   
 future of the quarry, and its 60 jobs 
 did not look good, but high speed     
 railways demand ever larger amounts   
 of ballast so the product is needed.  
 Permission has been give to enlarge   
 the working to give a 25 year future. </content>
