		<content>  Early potatoes are ready in June.We  
get these up as early as they are      
needed. Main Crop potatoes are         
harvested in October. they are stored  
all winter in frost-free buildings.    
Until recently we kept them in         
"Clamps".These were hollow trenches    
covered with straw and soil to protect 
the potoatoes from the weather.        
  The soil on our farm is "moos" soil  
which is very rich, black and fertile. 
The area used to be forest many        
thousands of years ago and now the     
ploughs sometimes hit a "moos stock".  
This is a tree trunk which is almost   
fossilised. It has to be dug up and    
dragged out of the ground by tractor.
