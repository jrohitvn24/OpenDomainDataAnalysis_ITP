		<title>14POLICE STATION, HEMEL</title>
		<content>   {Hemel Hempstead Police Station     
 (Marlowes) consists of lots of        
 different departments. They have a    
{telex system}through which they can   
 contact any police station in         
 Hertfordshire. There is a{finger-print
 department, where prints are taken and
 put on police records.                
    The{cells}are fairly clean and each
 cell has a toilet in it, with a wooden
 seat. At the end of the corridor there
 is a shower. That is the only place   
 where prisoners can wash. Men and     
 womens' cells are separate.           
    In the police station there is a   
 large{blackboard}which says which     
 beats all the different policemen are 
 on.                                   
    These are just a few of the        
 important things about our police     
 station.
