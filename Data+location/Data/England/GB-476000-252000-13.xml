		<title>13Quinton Church</title>
		<content> The tiny church at Quinton dates from 
 the 13th century, and is dedicated to 
 St.John the Baptist. It has a well    
 maintained churchyard, which is tended
 by the parishioners, who regularly    
 plant bulbs and cut the grass.        
 Of particular interest in the         
 churchyard is a pretty terracotta     
 tombstone. This inspired the design   
 for the new kneelers and altar frontal
 which are to be found in the church,  
 and which were worked by parishioners.
