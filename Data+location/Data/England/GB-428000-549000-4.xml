		<title>04ECOLOGY-RIVER WEAR WALK.</title>
		<content> Walking through the Castle woods and  
 by the river banks we saw delicate cow
 parsley,also named Lady's Lace,growing
 profusely, while red campion,speedwell
 cranesbill and stitchwort, ( a pain - 
 reliever in Medieval times), were very
 common. There was blue ground ivy,too.
 In some  areas, this is dried and used
 for brewing tea. It was  once  used by
 brewers  as a substitute  for hops. In
 the castle grounds, we saw  primroses,
 though picking them is illegal,as they
 are protected plants.  There were late
 celandines, with yellow pointed petals
 and the  delicate, pink herb robert.We
 also observed white deadnettle, bugle,
 plantain,shepherd's purse, bird's foot
 trefoil,woodruff,bistort,vetch,ribwort
 yarrow, butterbur and ragwort. Back at
 school, identifying  the more  unusual
 ones  presented  us  with  interesting
 detective work.  {L.Hardy,J.Patterson.</content>
