		<content> In Class 3J,we took a survey to show  
 the number and type of pets we had.   
 Here are the results:                 
{Guinea pigs           3

{No pets at all        3               
  A total of 25 children took part in  
 this survey.                          
 One boy was asked to describe his     
 pets.He said,"I have got two dogs,one 
 is called Plato,the other is called   
 Jackson.Both are two years old.One is 
 a cocker spaniel the other is a       
 mongrel.They do not fight.I have also 
 got a canary who is called Icarus.The 
 person who gave him to us,suggested   
 the name."                            </content>
