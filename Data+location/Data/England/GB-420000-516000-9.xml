		<title>09ULNABY HALL FARM-CONTINUED.</title>
		<content>{Farming}at Ulnaby Hall consists mostly
 of arable crops with some dairying.   
 The main{crops}are, potatoes, barley  
 and wheat, which are grown in         
 rotation. A recent change has been the
 growing of peas. Formerly there was a 
 wider range of crops, but now they    
 tend to specialise.                   
{Markets}for the crops include frozen  
 chip companies, Newcastle market and  
 some of the grain goes to Farmways    
 (see previous pages).However there are
 storage and grinding facilities on the
 farm.                                 
{Yields}are being improved by the use  
 of fertilizers, spraying with         
 pesticides and the introduction of new
 crop varieties.                       
 There is increasing use of{machinery  
 which has contributed to              
 specialization on the farm.
