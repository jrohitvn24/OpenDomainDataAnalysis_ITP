       Boys who belong to Cub Scouts   
 wear a green sweat shirt, grey shorts,
 grey socks, green cap and coloured    
 neckerchief. They pay subs, play      
 games, and work to gain various badges
 which are sewn onto the shirt sleeves.
       Girls who belong to Brownie     
 Guides wear a brown dress, long white 
 socks and a brown pom pom hat. They   
 pay subs, play games, and work to gain
 various badges which are sewn onto the
 sleeves of the dress and some onto the
 dress itself.                         
       Some girls go to Dancing classes
 where they wear lycra skirts,         
 leotards, white or pink tights and    
 black ballet shoes. Hair is worn up in
 a bun. Lessons are paid for as they   
 are taken. Exams are taken once a year
 and girls are entered for festivals.
