		<title>14EMPLOYMENT IN BLACKPOOL</title>
		<content> Practically all employment in         
 Blackpool is geared to the holiday    
 industry, which creates particular    
 problems in the area when the season  
 is over.  During the season the resort
 is filled with people who come seeking
 casual employment, but during the     
 winter the town empties, and          
 unemployment, particularly among      
 school leavers is high.  The holiday  
 aspect of the town creates almost two 
 levels of society which are possibly  
 unique to a holiday resort.  There are
 the successful hoteliers, businessmen 
 and the professional classes such as  
 accountants and solicitors  who look  
 after the former, and the second group
 of unemployed, or lowly paid who work 
 in the hotels and businesses.
