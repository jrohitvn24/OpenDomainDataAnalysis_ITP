		<content> trioxide which are the main components
 of acid rain.  However, despite this  
 precautions are taken to limit the    
 amount of sulphur dioxide released by 
 using a sulphur recovery unit.  Ash is
 also released during combustion.      
 In the cooling process which the      
 companies use, water vapour is        
 produced and precautions are taken to 
 prevent bacterial infection of this   
 water by adding chromate.             
 Water pollution is controlled by the  
 Water Authority who, in conjunction   
 with the Tees River Authority, test   
 the Tees regularly for pollution.  All
 water passing from the various        
 factories to the river are cleaned by 
 the companies' various biological     
 filtering units which some say make   
 the water cleaner than it was when the
 companies originally extracted ti from
 the Tees.                             </content>
