		<title>11CROFTON SCHOOLS, ORPINGTON</title>
		<content>{Crofton School} was built in 1936. It 
was first called Crofton Lane School.  
In Crofton Junior School at present    
there are about 760 children. In the   
1970s the school was at its largest.   
There were in the Infant and Junior    
schools about 1500 children altogether.
At first both schools were at what we  
now call the annexe. In 1950 the       
infants had their own school built on  
the other side of the road. They also  
had their own head teacher. In 1967    
the Juniors had a school built next to 
the Infants school. As far as we know  
we are {the largest Infant and Junior  
schools in England}.
