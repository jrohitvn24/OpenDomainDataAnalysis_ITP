		<content>  The block lies at the top of{Cheddar 
{Gorge}which, along with its caves, is 
 one of the busiest tourist centres in 
 the country. Footpaths allow tourists 
 the opportunity to gain access to the 
 pleasant countryside in the area,     
 including nature reserves at{Black    
{Rock, Velvet Bottom &amp; Longwood.}      
 Picnics are popular here, several     
 tracts of land are owned by the{      
{National Trust.}Tourism does bring its
 problems_litter, noise, congestion,   
 pollution &amp; high prices in some shops.
 One suggestion to ease these problems,
 was to close Cheddar Gorge to traffic 
 in the summer. It would mean large car
 parks being built. Despite the        
 pressures the area benefits from      
 tourism.
