		<title>07 TRANSPORT PENWORTHAM BYPASS</title>
		<content>  In our area the growth of traffic has
led to many problems,(so much so that  
on Penwortham bridge the amount of     
traffic was only 10% less than on the  
M6 at Salmesbury)so the task of        
building a by-pass began.The by-pass   
goes from Strand road to Cop lane.     
  35000 trees and shrubs are planted   
along the route to landscape the area  
of the road.The contractors that       
undertook the building of the bridge   
over the River Ribble are Harbour and  
General works(Stevin)Ltd,this was      
completed in Dec.84 at a cost of 2.2m  
pounds.The main road was built under a 
5.8 million pound contract by Sir      
Alfred McAlpine&amp; Son Ltd.and Fairclough
Civil Engineering Ltd.The by-pass and  
the bridge were officially opened on   
the 24th May 1985.
