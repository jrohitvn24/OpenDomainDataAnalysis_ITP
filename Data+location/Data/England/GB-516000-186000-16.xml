		<title>16NORTH BRENT - SHOPPING</title>
		<content> My five friends and I went to         
 Kingsbury to look round and do some   
 shopping. First we stopped by Lloyds  
 Bank to get some cash. Our next stop  
 was a fashion shop for some clothes.  
 Between us we bought bangles, a       
 ski-suit, trousers and a jacket. We   
 spent about Â£50. Then we visited the  
 Wimpy for a take-away meal. We each   
 had the same: beefburger in a bun with
 relish,lettuce, tomato sauce and a    
 coke to drink. Our next stop was the  
 pet shop to buy a hamster and some    
 rabbit food. At the Candybox          
 (sweetshop) we bought 7 Shushpuppies  
 (iced drinks) - 2 for Caroline;       
 chocolate and crisps. After looking   
 around for a bit more we caught the   
 183 bus home. A good day was had by   
 all.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
