		<title>01OVERVIEW OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content>  The south western corner of the block
 contains heavy{residential}development
 which has occurred over the last 20   
 years and which is continuing to      
 encroach into{agricultural areas,}a   
 topic of abiding local controversy.   
 The{airport}cuts deeply into the      
 block and has continued to increase in
 size on a fairly regular basis in the 
 same 20 years. The{small valleys and  
{farming areas}exhibit typical Jersey  
 traits: small fields, dairy farming   
 interspersed with crop rotation of the
 main export vegetables, potatoes,     
 tomatoes and cabbages. The{slopes}are 
 cultivated on the south facing side   
 and the northern slopes are deciduous 
 woodland. The{population}travels to   
 work predominantly in the town some 3 
 miles away. The{beaches}in the south  
 east of the block are very popular    
 with tourists in summer.              </content>
