		<title>02Cleeve Lock</title>
		<content>The present Cleeve lock is nine years  
old. It has been repaired lots of      
times.One man works there but in the   
summer there are two because more      
people go  boating during the summer   
.The Thames Water Authority own the    
lock.The lock keeper  starts work at   
9.00am.Weirs are used to keep the      
water deep enough for boats.The lock   
keeper has worked at the lock for      
eleven years.The water through the     
lock is flowing south.500to600 boats go
through the lock in a day in summer.100
go through other days.Once, in a day,  
the lock keeper opened and closed the  
lock gates 100 times.
