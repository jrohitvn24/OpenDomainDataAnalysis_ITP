		<content> Wyton Garage is situated at the       
 junction between 2 roads, the main    
 Hull to Withernsea road and the much  
 smaller road linking Bilton with      
 Sproatley.                            
 It is the only petrol filling station 
 in our area block.                    
 Before Wyton Garage became a garage it
 was a grocery shop. The owner, Mrs.   
 Hartley, employs 2 men full-time to   
 work in the garage and also uses 5 men
 on a part-time basis.                 
 The garage tests cars for their M.O.T.
 test as well as serving petrol.       
 It is open from 8.00a.m.to 6.00p.m.   
 Monday to Friday,8.00a.m.to 4.00p.m.  
 on Saturday and is open from10.00a.m. 
 to 2.00p.m. on a Sunday.
