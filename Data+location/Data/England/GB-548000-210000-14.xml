		<content>  The{Post Office}is combined with a   
 general store which provides for most 
 daily needs.                          
                                       
{Mr and Mrs Cowper}have been at the    
 Post Office for two months, but they  
 have lived in the area for two and a  
 half years. They help invalids with   
 their shopping and do deliveries,     
 mostly to the old who use the shop as 
 a base for help or company.           
                                       
 The{Post Office}deals with stamps,    
 about 350 parcels per week, pensions, 
 family allowances, Giro accounts,     
 bills and registered letters.         
                                       
{Unusual visitors}are the horses from  
 the nearby stables who pop their heads
 through the door for carrots when the 
 stable girls come shopping.
