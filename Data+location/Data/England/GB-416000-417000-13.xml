		<title>13MEMORIES OF RAWTHORPE 1</title>
		<content> We remember-when we,Mrs.Wright and    
 Mrs.Leng,moved to Rawthorpe Lane our  
 houses were in the countryside.There  
 were{open fields all around,stretching
{down to Kirkheaton, the only buildings
 being large,Millowners houses,small   
 cottages,our terrace houses and       
 farms.The only shop,on the corner of  
 Dalton Fold,was owned by Mrs.         
 Tinker."she were a right tinker       
 an'all!"The road was{cobbled}and      
 tarmac with a{wellflattened earth     
{footpath.}Coal,meat,bread and milk    
 were delivered by lorry or van,the    
 greengrocer had a{horse and cart.}    
 About 1955 Rawthorpe High School was  
 built,followed by the Infants and     
 Juniors.In 1945'6{german prisoners of 
{war}built a series of roads in the    
 fields to the east of Rawthorpe       
 Lane,the forerunners of the big Dalton
 estate of today.                      </content>
