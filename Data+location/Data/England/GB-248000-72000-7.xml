		<content>   The Livestock Market was established
 at its present site in the middle of  
 the 19th century.The original open air
 market was held in Market Street.     
 Livestock and fatstock markets for the
 sale of{cattle and sheep}are held on  
 Fridays and the second Wednesday in   
 the month.  Special annual sales are  
 held, including{Goose Fair}when geese 
 are auctioned.                        
    Ward and Chowen,the local estate   
 agents and auctioneers, are the       
 organisers and advertisers of the     
 market. Officials from the{R.S.P.C.A.}

 always present to make sure the       
 animals are healthy,tagged and well   
 treated. Farmers travel from the      
 surrounding area of Tavistock in order
 to buy,sell or to find out the best   
 prices of the animals.{Our livestock
