		<title>11Neighbourhood Policing</title>
		<content> A few years ago you could hardly      
 recognize your local policman because}
 they used to always drive around in   
 panda cars and only turned up at      
 crimes.Now most areas have a          
{Neighbourhood Beat Officer (N.B.O.)}  
 who is responsible for a particular   
 area. 90% of his time is spent walking
 or cycling most of his time is spent  
{visiting schools}and walking the beat 
 and checking property.He has 8 ways of
 getting to know  his area. He visits  
 our school and groups and             
 organisations. He holds a{police      
{surgery}for half an  hour in the      
 village hall once a month.He goes to  
{parish council meetings}and gets to   
 know shop holders. He writes in the   
 Inkstand  and runs an{attendance      
{centre }on saturdays for young people 
 who have been in  trouble with the    
 law.                                  </content>
