		<title>13EDUCATION CHANGE SINCE 1945</title>
		<content>Since 1918 the school leaving age has  
risen to 16 from 14.One of the         
biggest changes is discipline and      
attitudes to work.The relationship     
between pupil and teacher is also more 
relaxed.The cane was readily given     
even by prefects. There was also a     
strong sense of patriotism. Lessons    
were   similar although now there is   
a wider choice and pupils are          
encouraged   to work for themselves    
rather than be dictated to.This change 
is due to greater facilities           
e.g.laborortories calculators          
computers t.v etc.Classes were larger, 
about forty pupils but schools         
were small- 300 was large: boys and    
girls were always separated.Only in    
grammar schools were uniforms          
worn.Grammar school was fee paying     
unless a exam similar too the 11+ was  
passed.(Based on interviews with OAPS')</content>
