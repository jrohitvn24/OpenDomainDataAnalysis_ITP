		<title>12North Watford cemetery</title>
		<content>The North Watford Cemetery was first   
opened in 1931.  It has an area of 35  
acres.  There are many graves there,   
some just marked with little wooden    
crosses while others have gravestones. 
One of the stones is worth 1000 pounds 
and 2 others have photographs of the   
people who are buried there on them.   
My mum is buried in this cemetery.     
Also there is a mass grave for 12 of   
the 40 people who were killed when a   
V1 rocket bomb fell on Sandringham     
Road near Parkgate School on July 30th 
1944.                                  
North Watford Cemetery is a well-kept, 
peaceful place which is interesting to 
visit.
