		<content> The main pests that attack tomato     
 plants are white and red spider and   
 Buntings produce beneficial insects   
 which control these pests.They have a 
 unique production of insects and are  
 the larest producers in the U.K._     
 4,000,000 insects a week.             
   Tobacco plants are grown,because of 
 their big leaveas,these are placed in 
 a glasshouse and in 4_5hrs they are   
 covered by millions of white fly.The  
 plants are moved to another louse     
 where the white fly eggsnature for    
 about 2 weeks.They are then moved to  
 another louse where a very small wasp 
 lays its eggs in the white fly eggs,so
 controlling the development of the    
 white fly.These leaves are taken to   
 the packingshed where they are cut    
 into squares_100 eggs per square_which
 are mounted on card,packed and sent   
 all over the world.                   </content>
