		<content> As roadsides are not now sprayed with 
 herbicides and are cut only one swathe
 width after seeding some wild flowers 
 ie poppy, chamomile, bluebell, and    
 campion are now re-colonising road    
 verges. Rarer protected wild flowers, 
 ie cowslips, are carefully conserved  
 by individual landowners.             
 Several varieties of trees, including 
 conifers and native hardwoods are     
 being planted both as individual      
 specimens and in existing woodland.   
 Small areas of new woodland are being 
 created by private householders.      
 Ponds are being cleaned and reinstated
 to encourage waterloving plants and   
 birds. Streams are kept clear but the 
 water can be polluted by organic      
 loading from land drainage.           
 Some public footpaths in the area are 
 well used, others less so as they are 
 neither signposted nor waymarked.     </content>
