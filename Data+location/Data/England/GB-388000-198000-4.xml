		<content> This survey was concerned with the    
 longevity and population movement of  
 54 children aged between 5 and 11 in  
 the Minchinhampton, Cherington and    
 Avening areas.  60% were born in      
 Gloucestershire.  30 children had both
 grandfathers still alive, 17 had 1 and
 7 neither.  37 had both grandmothers  
 living, 15 had 1 and 2 neither.  8 had
 1 great-grandfather surviving, 1 had  
 2 but no-one had more.  10 children   
 had one great-grandmother alive, 4 had
 2 and l had 3.                        
 16 children said both parents were    
 born in Gloucestershire, 20 said one  
 was and 18 neither.  20 children said 
 that none of their grandparents was   
 born in the county, 14 said 1 was, 14 
 said 2, 3 said 3 and 3 said all 4 were
