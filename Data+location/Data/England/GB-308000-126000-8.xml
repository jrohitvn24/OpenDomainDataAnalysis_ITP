		<content> First of all we walked through a      
 garden of paradise and then into the  
 wood with thick undergrowth.There were
 many young trees but as we got further
 into the wood the trees seemed to get 
 older and taller.As we walked,trying  
 to pick out our path,we came to a big 
 rock face with a few small caves.     
 Further into the woods a wider cliff  
 face appeared but it was not so high, 
 again there were caves (probably the  
 homes of animals).                    
 We arrived in a clearing which had    
 some Roman mounds ,well we thought    
 they were,and more cliffs.Our guide   
 told us that the Monmouth rebels used 
 to hide in the caves 300 years ago.The
 cave system is said to lead to Frys   
 Quaking House about a mile and a half 
 away.You can get to more caves under  
 the Quakers burial ground.
