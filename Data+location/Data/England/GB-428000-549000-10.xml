 Tindale's, which  are  also  general  
 dealers.The newsagent sells cigarettes
 books and sweets.Alice's is a new shop
 which sells clothes and items         
 unavailable elsewhere.There is also a 
 greengrocer's, a  pharmacy  linked  to
 the doctor's surgery and a garage with
 forecourt. Two local dairymen  deliver
 milk  and  dairy  produce. There  is a
 Co-op. and  travelling shops  to serve
 the community. It is a  short bus ride
