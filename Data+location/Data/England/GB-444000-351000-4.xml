		<title>04THE LOCAL DISCO</title>
		<content>   I am 11 years old and once a week on
 Tuesday evenings I go to a{disco.}A   
 disco is a place where records are    
 played and people can dance.          
   The disco is held at a club called  
 Woody's in Jacksdale. It starts at    
 7.00pm. and finishes at 9.30pm. Only  
 children under 18 years old are       
 allowed to go. Discos are held on     
 other nights for adults.              
   At the disco popular records are    
 played and coloured lights flash.     
 Sometimes there are competitions for  
 the best dancers. The winners usually 
 get a record as a prize. If you get   
 hot whilst dancing you can buy a soft 
 drink and sit at a table to rest. If  
 you do not want to dance you can just 
 listen to the music or play pool or   
 play on one of the video games        
 machines. To enter the disco it costs 
 50 pence.                             </content>
