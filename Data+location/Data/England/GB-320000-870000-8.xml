		<title>08FARMS NEAR LOSSIEMOUTH.</title>
		<content> The two arable farms near Lossiemouth 
 are named Balgreen and North Greens.  
 Balgreen has 45 acres of arable land. 
 The ploughing of these fields takes   
 four and a half days to complete.     
 Spring barley and oats are sown,then  
 fertilised and nitrogen added  later. 
      During the growing season,the    
 crops are sprayed first with          
 weedkiller and secondly with          
 fungicide.Harvest time is in August   
 and the yield is around 70 tons.The   
 cereal crops are sent to be tested for
 nitrogen content.This is done by the  
 maltsters.If the crops pass the test, 
 they are soaked then dried before     
 being delivered to local distilleries,
 as part of the process of             
 whisky-making.                        
       North Greens is a smaller arable
 farm,which follows the same crop      
 procedure as  Balgreen.               </content>
