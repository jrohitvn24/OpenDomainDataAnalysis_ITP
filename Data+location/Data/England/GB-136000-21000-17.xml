		<content> Treen &amp; Penberth Women's Institute    
 held its first meeting on 2nd. October
 1970. Meetings are held on the third  
 Wednesday of every month, in Treen    
 Chapel at 7-30p.m. except in August,  
 with a committee meeting held on the  
 preceeding Monday. Membership (20 at  
 present) is three pounds per annum,   
 open to women over 14 years old. This 
 institute has a junior membership     
 starting at 10 years old. Each month  
 there is a competition based on the   
 subject of the speaker. The movement  
 is based on the spiritual ideals of   
 Fellowship, Truth, Tolerance and      
 Justice. Treen &amp; Penberth WI support  
 the RNLI as a favourite charity and   
 have worked on social concerns such as
 main line rail closure in Cornwall,   
 and VAT tax. The Royal Cornwall Show  
 is a long way to travel with entries, 
 but they did get a second prize once. </content>
