		<title>11  Health in Weaverthorpe</title>
		<content>    The most usual ailments are sore   
 throats, colds, coughs and other minor
 illnesses caused by viruses. Some     
 years there is a small epidemic of    
 chickenpox or mumps, which are usually
 confined to children, who recover     
 quickly.The number of cases of allergy
 -related illnesses is increasing.     
    When people are ill, most use the  
{general-practitioner group}based at   
{Sherburn and Rillington. Surgeries}are
 held in these villages every day      
 except Sunday, and additional ones in 
 some of the smaller villages. At      
 Weaverthorpe there are three each week
 and one baby clinic each month, all   
 held in the{Village Hall.}            
   {Hospital}cases attend Scarborough, 
 Malton, Driffield, Bridlington and    
 Hull. People visit{dentists}and       
{opticians}in these towns and at       
 Hunmanby.                             </content>
