		<title>07Recreation in Wimbledon</title>
		<content> In Wimbledon there are not many       
 differrent recreational places to     
 go.There are a lot of parks but most  
 of them are all the same with a few   
 swings and a slide,not forgetting the 
 very large field on which people      
 either walk their dogs or play        
 football.The best park in the area is 
 probably Wimbledon Park because it has
 most facilities .It has about 16      
 tennis courts,two putting greens of   
 which one is pitch and putt.Wimbledon 
 Park also has a boating lake and a    
 running track with a stand so you can 
 watch.The park also has its own large 
 field for dog walking and a lot of    
 park amusements for little kids,with  
 the old favourites the swings and     
 slide.Wimbledon Park is normally      
 packed during the tennis championships
 but because it is large it can take   
 the extra tourists.                   </content>
