		<content>     My alarm clock wakes me in the    
morning and I go downstairs to make my 
breakfast of toast and jam.   Then I   
make my bed and put my nightclothes    
away.   After I wash   and clean my    
teeth I get dressed and make breakfast 
and a  cup of tea for my mum.   Then I 
put on my coat and shoes and go to     
school on my own.   As soon as I reach 
school I usually get my maths book out 
or sometimes I get my reading book out 
and sit in the quiet area until my     
teacher takes the register.            
    After the register our teacher     
tells us what work we are doing.   On  
Monday we start with Language, after   
which we do Maths or our Topic on      
Frogs. At l0.30 we have our milk and a 
biscuit and go out to play.   At 10.45 
we come in and write down our spellings
and tables which we have to learn for a
test on Friday.                        </content>
