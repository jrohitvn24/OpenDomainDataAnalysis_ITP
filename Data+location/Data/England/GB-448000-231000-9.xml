		<title>09 AYNHO:INTERESTING BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>   The {ALMSHOUSES} were built in 1822 
for old people. There are 8 terraced   
houses built of stone with a slate     
roof. There is an arch in the middle   
and 4 houses on each side. John Baker, 
an Oxford glazier built them for old   
people from Aynho or St. Aldates,      
Oxford.                                
   The {GRAMMAR HOUSE} used to be a    
school from 1695 for 200yrs and then   
it became the Cartwright's Dower       
House. There are 3 cellars, one of     
which is thought to have a secret      
passage. There is a balcony near the   
roof. The windows are stone-mullioned. 
   The {STOCKS} are in Roundtown and   
were used when people had to be        
punished. They are 2 horizontal planks 
of wood with holes which the person's  
legs were put through. They were left  
there for a day and pelted with rotten 
eggs etc.                              </content>
