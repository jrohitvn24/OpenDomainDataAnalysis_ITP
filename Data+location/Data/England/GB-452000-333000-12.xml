		<title>12O.A.P's VIEWS OF CLIFTON</title>
		<content>  These are the old people's views on  
 Clifton from a survey we did of 20    
 O.A.P's.                              
  Most old people like the{shops}in    
{Clifton}because there is a good       
 variety of everything.The{Supermarkets
 are cheap but many O.A.P's find the   
 prices in the smaller shops           
 expensive.Some of the old people found
 difficulty in getting to the shops    
 because they are too far away.        
  Nearly all the old people did not    
 like the way the{houses}are laid out  
 on the estate,though one said it was  
 "better than worse".They said there   
 are too many houses and the roads are 
 confusing.Many felt they didn't like  
 the design of the houses but this did 
 not apply to the old people in        
 sheltered homes.                      
  The old people felt young{children}  
 are nice with little vandalism.       </content>
