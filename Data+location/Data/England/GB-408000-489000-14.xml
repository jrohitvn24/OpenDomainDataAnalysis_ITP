		<title>14SHOPPING IN LEYBURN</title>
		<content> The area is well served for shopping. 
 In Leyburn there is a good selection  
 of shops both food and non-food. The  
 nearest large town where branches of  
 multiple stores are to be found is at 
 Darlington which is twenty two miles  
 distance.                             
 There is a weekly market held in      
 Leyburn on Friday of each week. This  
 is always a bustling scene throughout 
 the year. The number of extra visitors
 in the summer months does creat       
 traffic problems on Market Day.       
 Regular shoppers in Leyburn come from 
 an area of ten miles radius.          
 It would be correct to say that no one
 shop has a monopoly - all businesses  
 have competition from other traders.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
