 cokeworks attatched to it but this was
 closed and demolished by 1958 when a

    The colliery needed many workers   
 and the owners of the mine began to   
 build the houses necessary for the    
 miners and their families.The houses  
 were originally built as two or three 
 up and two down terraced houses with  
 outside toilets and coalhouses.The    
 very first houses of this type were   
 demolished in the mid 1970's but many 
 of the houses have been modernised    
 and                                   
 now provide very comfortable homes,   
 though they still look very depressing
 from the outside and they still do not
 have any gardens.
