		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> During the week I get up at seven     
o'clock. I get dressed and washed      
before going downstairs to breakfast at
7:30p.m.  At 8:30 I catch the school   
bus. I get to school at 8:55. At nine  
o'clock school begins. We have         
registration, then assembly. We work   
until 10:35 then have a break until    
10:50. Then we have P.E. or a          
television program until lunch at 12.  
 Afternoon school begins at 1:15a.m. We
have music and art and finish the day  
with a story. The school bus collects  
us at 3:30.                            
 When I get home I ride my bike until  
teatime.  After tea I watch the        
television until my bedtime which is   
8:30p.m.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
