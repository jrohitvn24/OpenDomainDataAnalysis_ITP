		<title>15COLLINS FARM HIGH LAVER</title>
		<content> Mr Collins grows crops and he also has
 a herd of 52O Freisian bulls which he 
 keeps for beef. Every 8 months he buys
 5O calves age 3 months and he sells   
 them at a year old for beef. They are 
 fed with a special food mix which is  
 made on the farm. The cattle are kept 
 in pens according to their age. Any   
 sick animals are taken out of the pens
 and put into a seperate barn to       
 prevent the spread of disease.        
 Mr. Collins employs 6 farm workers; 1 
 stockman and 5 landworkers. At harvest
 time he takes on extra labour on a    
 casual basis.                         
 The farm has 12 tractors, 2 combine   
 harvesters, ploughs, a grading machine
 and cooling machine for the potatoes  
 and a dryer for the grain crops.
