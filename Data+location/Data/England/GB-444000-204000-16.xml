		<content> Iron Age settlements were found on the
 meadows at Farmoor when the reservoirs
 were being constructed. There are no  
 traces of Roman settlements in the    
 area. In Saxon times a "vill" was     
 established on the ridge at Cumnor    
 where there was drinking water and    
 natural defence. It was at this period
 that lands in the area were given to  
 the Benedictine Abbey of Abingdon, of 
 which Cumnor subsequently became a    
 grange. It is thought that Cumnor     
 Place, built by the Abbey was a       
 country residence, perhaps a          
 convalescent home, for the monks. Two 
 Abbots are buried in Cumnor Church. At
 the dissolution of the monasteries the
 last Abbot of Abingdon became Vicar of
 Cumnor.
