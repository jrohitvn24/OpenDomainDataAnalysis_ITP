		<content> There is an area of woodland to the   
 west of the church mainly stock with  
 young trees as Dutch elm disease      
 decimated it in recent years. Young   
 horsechestnut and oak trees have been 
 planted alongside the greens. There is
 a natural pond near the intersection  
 of the Foxton Road and the High       
 Street. At the Orwell Road end of the 
 green there is another pond made in   
 recent years by widening the brook.   
 Both have families of ducks. A village
 sign was erected in the early 1980s.  
 The old congregational chapel was     
 built in 1856. It was bought in 1977  
 by John Brigrell &amp; Co after being     
 derelict for 8 years and eas converted
 into a luxury 3 storey house. As there
 is no garden space an indoor garden   
 has been created on the ground floor -
 tinted glass, potted plants and a     
 fountain in a water lily pond.        </content>
