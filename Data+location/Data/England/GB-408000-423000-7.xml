 built in the nineteenth century and   
 was made bigger in 1977.At first the  
 paper was housed in a library building
 because the tax was too much.Just over
 200 people are employed by the Courier

 office uses about 12 vans to deliver  
 the newspapers to newsagents.The      
 Evening Courier sells about 39,000    
 Couriers per day.The machinery is run 
 by computers to speed the process.They
 use approx. 25 tonnes of paper per
