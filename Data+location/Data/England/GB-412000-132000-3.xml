		<content> THERE ARE FIVE CLUBS IN OUR BLOCK.    
 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO SCOUT OR GUIDE  
 TROOPS IN THE AREA THE CHILDREN ARE   
 ABLE TO ATTEND SCOUTS AND GUIDES IN   
 SALISBURY.  THERE IS THE DORSET       
 GLIDING CLUB AND THE PTA (PARENT      
 TEACHER ASSOCIATION).  THE PTA TAKE   
 THE MONEY FROM SCHOOL FETES ETC AND   
 USE IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILDREN
 IN THE SCHOOL.  THE RUGBY CLUB MOSTLY 
 USE HUDSONS FIELD AS THEIR PLAYING    
 GROUNDS BUT SOMETIMES THEY USE SOME   
 FIELDS AT OLD SARUM AIRFIELD.  THE    
 GLIDING CLUB USES THE OLD SARUM       
 AIRFIELD AS THEIR BASE.  THEY HAVE 170
 MEMBERS WITH 5 GLIDERS AND ONE TOW    
 PLANE FOR THE GLIDERS.  THE CLUB HAS  
 BEEN GOING FOR A SURPRISING FOUR YEARS
 IN SALISBURY.  THEY HAVE HAD ONLY A   
 FEW MINOR ACCIDENTS.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
