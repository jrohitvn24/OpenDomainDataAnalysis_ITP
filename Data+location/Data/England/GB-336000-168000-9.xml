		<title>09GAMES AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We play most of the popular games at {
{Mary Elton School in the West End of  
{Clevedon }but we play some games you  
 may not find everwhere.One of these is
{"Danish Long Ball".}It consists of 2  
 teams of 12-15.One team bats and thay 
 line up one behind the other.The      
 fielding team spreads over a 50-60    
 metre field.One bowler is chosen from 
 the fielders.The bowler stands 5      
 metres away from the batter and bowls 
 a tennis ball underarm.When the       
 batter(who uses a bat like padder     
 tennis racket)hits the ball he/she    
 must run to the other end of the field
 without being hit by the ball.He/she  
 can also be caught out.To score a run 
 the batter has to run back down the   
 field again without being hit but he  
 need not come back immediately.The    
 teams swop when five batters are out.
