		<title>06BRANT BROUGHTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall, which is chiefly a  
 wooden building with a brick base, is 
 situated in the middle of the village.
 It was moved from Cranwell at the end 
 of the 1914-18 war.Clubs meet there,  
 entertainment is put on and           
 fund-raising efforts and wedding      
 receptions are held.Some villagers    
 were asked questions about the hall.  
 Most people only use the hall a few   
 times a year although some go there at
 least once a month. Most people go    
 either for the doctor's surgery or to 
 watch entertainment. Only one person  
 interviewed goes more frequently since
 the alterations have been completed.  
 Asked what they would like to see     
 happening at the village hall, people 
 made the following suggestions: more  
 entertainment, whist drives and more  
 activities for children. All thought  
 the hall an asset to the village.     </content>
