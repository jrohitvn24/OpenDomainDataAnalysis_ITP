 run by the {Anglicans }and {Methodists
 for 3 to 12  year  olds.  It meets  at

   They  sing  hymns  from the BBC book
{"Come And Praise",}pray, listen  to  a
 Bible story and may  draw  a  picture,
 act a play or make a collage.         
   In July  1985  25 children took part
 in the{Sunday School Anniversary.} The
 theme was Caring and Sharing, they had
 written  the  service  including plays
 about Jesus  and  stories of  Live Aid
 for  Ethiopia,  Mother Teresa and  the
 National  Childrens  Home.  Afterwards
 everyone had tea together.
