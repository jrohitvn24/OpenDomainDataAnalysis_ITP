		<title>10INDUSTRY - CEMENT MAKING</title>
		<content>    BLUE CIRCLE INDUSTRIES             
   Just outside Bradwell is the Hope   
 Cement Works.  It is the largest      
 cement manufacturing plant in the     
 North of England.                     
  {Limestone}is blasted out of the     
 quarry above Bradwell in huge lumps   
 then crushed into small pieces. {Shale
 is quarried close by between Hope and 
 Bradwell.  These are the two main     
 ingredients in the cement making      
 process.                              
   The cement works is by far the most 
 important supplier of employment in   
 this area.  Almost half the children  
 in Bradwell Primary School have       
 parents working at this one factory.  
   In the last few years the work force
 has been falling as new machines have 
 been introduced.  This is a rather    
 worrying situation for school leavers 
 who will soon be looking for jobs.    </content>
