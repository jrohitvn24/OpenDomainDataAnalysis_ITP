strong social function enabling members
to meet their M.P.Mr Tim Yeo who was   
elected at the last election and now   
lives in East Bergholt.Other social    
functions such as supper parties and   
cheese and wine evenings enable members
to keep in touch and also to raise     
fundsds  which are needed during both  
local and national elections.Then      
members help by delivering leaflets    
and transporting elderly and disabled  
people to polling stations.
