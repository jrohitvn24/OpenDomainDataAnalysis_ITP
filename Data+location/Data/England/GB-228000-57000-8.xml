		<content>  The Plymouth  naval dock yard has    
 15,000 people working there. A        
 number of them come from our area.    
 There are some farming jobs available.
 The majority of other jobs are linked 
 very much with tourism.               
  Gift shops,restaurants,pubs,holiday  
 cottages and hotels do a very good    
 trade during the months of April,May, 
 June, July,August and September.The   
 other six monthes are different       
 because they are quieter and the above
 enterprises lose custom, and have to  
 survive on local trade which is often 
 difficult.                            
  Mrs.Preston was the organist at      
 Widegates Methodist Church until she  
 died last year now Mrs Wills plays the
 organ.Mrs Day ran the Sunday School   
 until Christmas.No one has been found 
 to take it over.
