		<title>09The National Trust, Wetton</title>
		<content>     The National Trust is an          
independent charity which looks after  
places of historic interest, and places
of outstanding beauty.                 
     The job involves general estate   
work etc., fencing and stone walling,  
improving the habitat for wildlife -   
birds, butterflies, etc., helping      
visitors by giving them information and
directions, protecting the countryside 
owned by the National Trust against    
vandals etc.                           
     The N.T.'s property gets quite    
busy with visitors during the summer   
months, especially at weekends.  In the
winter there are not so many visitors. 
     The N.T.'s land extends along the 
Manifold Valley and includes such      
properties as Ossom's Hill Farm,       
Ladyside Farm and Wetton Mill.
