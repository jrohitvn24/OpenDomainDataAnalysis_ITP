		<content>     The{Abercairney Estate}covers     
 around 20,000 acres of land.  A large 
 section of this is given to{forestry  
 which is a profitable part of the     
 Estate.                               
     There are 2 full-time foresters.  
 Part of their job is to re-plant so   
 many trees every year.  Wood such as  
{silver birch, Douglas fir, Scots pine 
 and{Spruce}are used.  New trees are   
 planted approximately 5 feet apart and
 then thinned as they grow.            
     Mature timber is sent to the      
 Estate sawmill where it is used for   
 general repair work.  Some trees are  
 sent to Edinburgh at{Christmas}for    
 sale, although this is the largest    
 outside sale the Estate has for its   
 wood.
