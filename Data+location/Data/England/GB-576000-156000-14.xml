She gets up at 7:30 to iron a blouse to
wear to work. Then she makes herself   
some toast and coffee, usually burning 
the toast.  She makes me a mug of tea  
with milk and two sugars and makes     
breakfast for my sister.  After eating,
she showers, washes her hair and       
brushes her teeth.  She gets dressed,  
puts on her make-up as her hair dries. 
At 8:45 she leaves for work, as        
personal secretary to the Chairman of  
Maidstone United Football Club.        
                                       
                                       
She usually arrives home at about 6:30 
and makes tea for my dad and herself.  
After that she usually watches TV for  
an hour and then helps dad with his    
work (in the studio completing video   
programs).
