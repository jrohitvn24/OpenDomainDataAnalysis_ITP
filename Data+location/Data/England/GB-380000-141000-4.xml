 thirty-four children aged from four to
 eleven. Most of the children come from
 the Village itself although there is  
 one family from Crockerton and one    
 from Warminster. The children are     
 divided into two classes; one infant  
 and one junior. There is a Headmaster,
 an assistant teacher, two cooks, one  
 cleaner, one lunch supervisor and a   
 secretary.                            
 The School is very well equipped with 
 two BBC Model B Computers with Disk   
 Drives and a printer. There is a      
 Colour Television,  a Video Recorder  
 and a Hi-Fi System for the playing of 
 tepes and records. The School also has
 a large Library. There is a great deal
 of land attached to the School        
 including a field, wild area, an      
 orchard and a playground. There is    
 soon to be an Adventure Playground.   </content>
