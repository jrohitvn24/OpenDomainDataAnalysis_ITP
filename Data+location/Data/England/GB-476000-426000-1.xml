		<content> This area is wet and flat 0'-150'     
 above sea level some clay deposits are
 bases for ponds giving sanctury to    
 Duck, Geese, Moorhen.   Large fields  
 of cereals, Rape vegetables with      
 minimal hedgeing drain into man-made  
 dykes.   Highly mechanised farming    
 with small labour force cattle and    
 pigs reared inside buildings.   Many  
 footpaths across fields connect two   
 small farming communities and outlying
 homesteads, all homes on mains water  
 and electricity.   Road-level bridges 
 cross drains where they intersect with
 narrow metalled roads allowing passage
 to motorised vehicles.   Mixed        
 woodland gives cover to large variety 
 of wild birds and animals including   
 Pheasant, Heron, Squirrels.   In the  
 north - the west to east secondary    
 road gives access to the coast but no 
 access to arterial road running       </content>
