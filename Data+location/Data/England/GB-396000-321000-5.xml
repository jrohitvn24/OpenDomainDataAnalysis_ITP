		<title>05SHUGBOROUGH MUSEUM</title>
		<content>  The building which houses the museum 
is 200 years old,but the museum was    
opened 19 years ago.  The visitors come
from far and wide, but most come from  
Staffordshire.  Approximately 124,000  
people come for site visits each year. 
  The museum is open in summer every   
day except Mondays unless it is a Bank 
Holiday.                               
  The money to run the museum comes    
from local rates and entrance fees.    
  The museum is trying to depict life  
in Victorian times.  There are 16      
different galleries.  One is a         
Victorian schoolroom which local       
children can visit,dress in period     
costume and act out the lives of pupils
of 100 years ago.                      
  The Victorian laundry helps us to    
picture the busy lives of the laundry  
maids who once worked at Shugborough   
Hall.                                  </content>
