		<title>12PUBLIC ATTITUDES TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>{View 1.}Marton is a residential area  
  with a wide range of both old and    
 modern properties.It is served by a   
 variety of corner-shops and large     
 supermarkets with more than a few     
 public houses and working-men's clubs.
 The local bus services are very good  
 giving a variety of routes into       
 Blackpool town centre and South Shore.
 If any personal criticism is to be    
 levied it is against the condition of 
 the public roads and pavements.These  
 are in a deteriorating condition,and  
 the council is not particularly quick 
 at repairing pot-holes etc.There is   
 also inadequate parking facilities    
 near to many of the retail            
 establishmewnts especially those such 
 as the local fish and chip shops.This 
 is quite a problem during shop and    
 trading hours as it prevents local    
 people from parking their own cars    </content>
