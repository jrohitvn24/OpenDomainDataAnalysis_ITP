		<title>15Harbour and Fishing</title>
		<content> When a boat based in Scarborough      
 leaves the harbour the lighthouse     
 keeper checks its departure and       
 return. If one fails to return the    
{coast guard}is alerted. The           
 Scarborough fishing fleet is made up  
 of{trawlers,}which stay out for nearly
 a week, and{potters}which just go out 
 for the day. The fishing industry is  
 dying out because of{competition}from 
 foreign countries such as Norway,     
 Germany and Denmark. The{fish market  
 is held every Thursday morning after  
 the boats have landed their catch.    
 Then the{buyers}and{auctioneers}arrive
 and the sale starts, finishing around 
 dinner-time. Over the past three years
 prices have risen enormously, and     
 today the most expensive fish are flat
 fish. The{yachting harbour}is also    
 important and there is a gun on the   
 lighthouse used to start races.       </content>
