		<content>    Block 04520159 is mainly           
 agricultural land in a level valley   
 between the Hampshire Downs, south of 
 Kingsclere and the land rising north  
 of Ashford Hill. It is drained by a   
 stream running into the River Enborne 
 and much of it was once destined to be
 flooded to form a resevoir - a plan   
 fortunately abandoned.                
    The fields are mainly grass and    
 arable and there are several large    
 mixed woods. One or two areas of      
 unimproved pasture are botanically    
 rich with wild daffodils in the spring
 and wild orchids in summer. Corn      
 marigold survives in some of the corn 
 fields and the woods contain primroses
 , wood anemones , solomons seal and   
 bluebells.
