 Raiselands Croft is a council estate  
 situated just outside of Penrith.It   
 was built in 2 stages,the 1st stage   
 was when the pre-war houses were built
 in 1936 and the 84 houses were        
 finished in 1938.Another 24 were built
 in 1967.They are 3 bedroomed houses   
 with an average family of 3 or 4      
 persons.Most of the houses are rented 
 but 10 of them have been bought.There 
 are three different types of          
 houses,the pre-war houses,the         
 modernized pre-war houses and the     
 modern houses.Most of the people who  
 live there are related in some        
 way,many stay there for life.The      
 nearest school for infants is         
 Brunswick Road.At home the children   
 have a grassland play area at the     
 bottom of the estate.Raiselands Croft 
 covers 8.09 acres.                    </content>
