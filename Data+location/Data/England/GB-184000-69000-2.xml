		<title>02A WATER PUMP &amp; AN OLD LANE</title>
		<content> In {TREBURRICK}there is an old water  
 pump. It has been there for about     
 200-300 years.If you put a little bit 
 of water in the top it works.In the   
 old days you would have used this to  
 get your water because there were no  
 taps then.                            
                                       
{AN OLD LANE IN TREBURRICK}            
 In Treburrick there is an old lane.   
 It was last used 100 years ago.  It is
 soggy and boggy and fairly grown in.  
 It is very brambley as well.
