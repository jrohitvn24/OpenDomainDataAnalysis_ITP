		<title>14 CURRY'S POINT</title>
		<content> Curry's Point is a headland to the    
north of Whitley Bay.Off Curry's Point 
is St.Mary's Island upon which stands  
the lighthouse.The headland is composed
of sandstone and coal seams of the     
carboniferous period,upon which lies   
boulder clay deposited by the last ice 
age. To the north of Curry's Point the 
land is being eroded away at a fast    
rate.To the south of Curry's Point a   
sea wall has been built to protect the 
soft rocks.                            
    Curry's Point is so called after   
Michael Curry who was executed there on
the fourth of September 1739 for       
murdering the landlord of "THE THREE   
HORSE SHOES",at Heartley ie. Robert    
Shevil.Curry was sentenced at Newcastle
to hang here so he could see the scene 
of his crime.It was suspected that     
Shevil's wife aided Curry,but Curry    
denied it.                             </content>
