		<title>12GENERAL SUMMARY</title>
		<content> The whole area is{agricultural,}mainly
 livestock with a little wheat and     
 barley. Land is intensively farmed by 
 families working several farms in     
 co-operation. Many families have      
 farmed the area for several           
 generations. Apart from agricultural  
 land the area{is dotted with small    
{enclosed deciduous woodland.}There is 
 an 18th century Hall, a 16th century  
 Manor, several half-timbered black and
 white houses and a{Roman road}dividing
 the area and linking Droitwich with   
 Alcester. There is a{twice-daily bus  
{service.}The railway line and canal   
 cross this road, the canal now used   
 for leisure purposes. The station and 
 brickworks have both been closed for  
 several years. Broughton Green still  
 maintains a cluster of houses around a
 small Anglican Chapel, but there are  
 no other amenities there.             </content>
