		<title>08THE FISHERMEN'S CHAPEL</title>
		<content> We have visited the Fishermen's chapel
 at St. Brelade's Church. We met       
 Reverend Halliwell and he showed us   
 around. He told us about the history  
 of the chapel, which was built about  
 the 10th. century, before the Domesday
 book had been written. At the moment  
 the roof is being repaired and we     
 could not go inside. The chapel used  
 to be the church, but now it stands   
 alongside the present church, parts of
 which also date from Norman times.    
 We were shown the 'perquage' path down
 which anyone who wished sanctuary from
 the law could walk to the sea and make
 an escape, all under the protection of
 the church. Each of the parish        
 churches in Jersey had a perquage path
  and, although they can no longer be  
 used for their original purpose, they 
 are the subject of much local folklore
 and interest.                         </content>
