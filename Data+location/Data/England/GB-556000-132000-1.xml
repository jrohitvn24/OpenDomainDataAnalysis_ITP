		<title>01Survey Area,Mark Cross,Frant</title>
		<content> The area lies between Eridge,Frant    
 and Mark Cross. The highest point is  
 Saxonbury Hill and that is 203 metres 
 high. Most of the area is fields with 
 quite a few small copses and woods. It
 is gently rolling farmland with fields
 divided by hedges. There are no       
 villages only farms and private       
 houses,many tile hung in the          
 traditional Sussex style.Most of the  
 farms are sheep or dairy farms with   
 one or two large arable farms.The     
 woodland is all deciduous woodland    
 where some coppicing is carried out.  
    There is a lot of wild life in     
 the area including deer,pheasants,    
 plenty of rabbits,foxes and           
 badgers.There are also some caves in  
 Eridge Old Park.The caves are quite   
 dark inside and were once used for    
 hanging meat.There are also many      
 pleasant country walks to enjoy.      </content>
