		<title>11Tolney Lane, Newark</title>
		<content> Tolney Lane is long and open with two 
 caravan sites. There are some old     
 derelict railway carriages and some   
 houses. There is a scrapyard and a    
 knackers yard on the same piece of    
 land. The knackers yard breeds maggots
 for anglers. At the fork of the road  
 is a cottage where an old man lives.  
 On the right fork is a large building 
 called Millhouse. On it are printed   
 the words "Davey's Noted Ales, Offices
 and Brewery, Barnbygate, Newark.      
 Tolney Lane is classed as a rough area
 but it is quite industrious. Gypsies  
 are the local residents. who live in  
 caravans on 3 different sites amongst 
 the untidy greenery. There are no     
 shops but the Lane is close to the    
 town.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
