		<title>05TALK OF TOTTON</title>
		<content> A recent survey of the residents      
 of West Totton conducted by students  
 revealed some interesting points. As  
 part of their environmental studies   
 they collated information from a      
 questionnaire distributed to over 500 
 homes.                                
 The results pinpointed deficiencies in
 the development plan which will affect
 the population over the next 8 years. 
 As this will rise to over 10,000 the  
 survey showed a lack of basic         
 amenities such as telephone boxes,    
 letter boxes, and roads on the new    
 estates have been made too narrow to  
 take a standard service bus. With many
 of the new residents being young      
 families there will be a need for a   
 community centre, shops, a post       
 office, a church, a doctors' surgery  
 and a dentist. These have not been    
 catered for.                          </content>
