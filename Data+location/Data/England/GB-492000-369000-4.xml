		<content> The farms we have visited in the area 
 are{arable, dairy or mixed.           
 The sizes of the farms ranged from 10 
 to 260 hectares. All of the farmers   
 owned their land except Mr. Sharp who 
 farms{Oak Farm.}His farm is owned by  
 Lincoln City Council.                 
{Oak, Monson, Lincoln Road,}and{Fen    
{Farms}are all mixed, which means that 
 they have a dairy herd as well as     
 growing crops. All of the farmers used
 machines to milk the cows and the     
 tanker came every day to collect it.  
{Decoy}and{Waterloo}are arable farms   
 which means that they grow crops. All 
 of the farms grew{wheat, barley,      
{potatoes and grass}to make silage     
 which is used to feed animals in      
 winter. Farms with no animals sold the
 silage.
