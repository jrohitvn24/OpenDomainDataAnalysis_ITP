		<title>03Lyminge Village Hall (cont)</title>
		<content>  Next to the hall is the Cub Hut      
 which was opened shortly afterwards in
 July 1982 by Marion and Fred Hart.    
 Every Tuesday the Cubs go from 6pm    
 till 7.30pm. The Scouts hold their    
 meetings on Fridays from 7.30pm until 
 9.15pm. The Cub Hut was bought from   
 Dymchurch and constructed by the      
 parents of the Cub Scouts. The        
 Brownies and Guides both use the Hut  
 on a Thursday. In 1982 we held a      
 pageant on the green next to the      
 village hall. It was all about life   
 between Saxon times and the second    
 world war. The whole school was       
 involved and some of the villagers    
 entered into the spirit by wearing    
 costumes from the various periods. The
 Rector came as King Henry VIII and Mr 
 Jones (our headmaster) came as a      
 nineteenth century headmaster.
