		<content>Milton's Cottage is used to house a    
small museum of village bygones.There  
is a large open fireplace and several  
cooking utensils -iron pots,a large    
kettle,a ratchet for raising and lower-
ing pots so as to vary the heat for    
cooking.These may have been used by    
Milton. There is an old lace making    
pillow and some interesting bobbins,   
lace making having been a common employ
ment for girls and women in this area  
during the 19th century.(Old Lace      
School in Seer Green) On the walls hang
several paintings of Chalfont St Giles 
at different times in the past and a   
copy of the Death Warrant of Charles 1 
showing the signature of George Fleet- 
wood,owner of The Vache,an estate in   
the village, now an NCB college,which  
was confiscated by the Crown at the    
Restoration,as a punishment for his    
part in the regicide.                  </content>
