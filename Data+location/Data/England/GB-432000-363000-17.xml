		<content> There are alot of old houses around   
 Ashover.The school its self was built 
 in 1877.There used to be a school up  
 the Rattle I think it is used for an  
 old peoples home now.Farm houses are  
 scatterd all around Ashover itself,but
 most of the buildings in Ashover are  
 now used by commuters who travel to   
 places like Matlock to go to work.    
 People who travelled there would      
 probably work at the County Offices.  
 Chesterfield is another place where   
 people might work along with,Derby,   
 Nottingham and Sheffield.             
 Some houses were built quite early    
 heres a list_:Ambervale Hydro was     
 built in 1888,Bath House Farm was     
 built in 1720,and convented to a poor 
 house in 1767,Ashover Hill School was 
 built in 1703.There is a new house up 
 the Rattle called Amberstone house it 
 has a swimming pool indoors.          </content>
