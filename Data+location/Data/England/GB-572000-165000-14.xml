The area has a number of institutions  
which provide residential care for the 
elderly, the young and the             
handicapped.  For the elderly there    
are several local authority homes and  
several private institutions set up in 
the 18th and 19th centuries by         
charitable bodies. The young are cared 
for in Medvale House in accordance     
with the provisions of the Children    
and Young Persons Act. The             
Handicapped, in mind and body, are     
cared for mainly in the community, but 
in residential accommodation when the  
family is unable to cope. The          
following two pages examine aspects of 
residential care for the elderly in    
Rochester upon Medway.
