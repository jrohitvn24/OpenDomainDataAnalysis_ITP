		<title>19Poynton Station continued</title>
		<content> It has an hourly service in both      
 directions during the latter part of  
 the morning, early afternoon and late 
 evening.   The frequency of trains    
 increases to half-hourly service      
 during rush hours.                    
 The trains are electric running from  
 Manchester (Picadilly) to Stafford -  
 stopping at all stations en route.    
 Twice a day in each direction the     
 Manchester_Birmingham train stops at  
 Poynton.                              
 Formerly the station handled coal and 
 milk traffic.   There were sidings and
 a signal box both of which have been  
 demolished.   A gas works and brick   
 works were located near the station - 
 both served by sidings.   All of this 
 industry has now disappeared.         
 Today the station has three regular   
 staff with the official grade of      
 leading railwaymen.                   </content>
