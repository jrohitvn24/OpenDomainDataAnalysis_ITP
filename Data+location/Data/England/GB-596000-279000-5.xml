		<title>05RIDDLESWORTH CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Peter's Church, Riddlesworth      
 belongs to the parish with Gasthorpe  
 and Knettishall which is served by one
 vicar who has four other parishes.    
 The vicar has served here for just    
 over one year. He gives seven services
 weekly plus about ten christenings,   
 marriages and funerals yearly.  About 
 100 people live in the parish, but    
 only a handful attend services.       
 Riddlesworth Church has a larger      
 congregation during term time when all
 Riddlesworth Hall School attend       
 services each Sunday.  This helps to  
 keep the church open.  The nave and   
 tower are both Norman 14th century and
 now in need of repair. The Church     
 Council is responsible for the        
 churches' maintenance. The church has 
 a voluntary treasurer who is respons- 
 ible for overseeing the finances and  
 collection, and an organist.          </content>
