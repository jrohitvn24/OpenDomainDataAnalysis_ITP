		<title>05WILD FLOWERS AND TREES</title>
		<content> The flora varies according to height, 
 terrain and land use. Flowers and     
 grasses in the hay meadows, some of   
 which have been cut for hundreds of   
 years, are abundant. In the pastures  
 they are not so for the obvious reason
 that they have difficulty establishing
 themselves. On the rocks of the scars,
 the plants are small and delicate.    
 The area is rich in a large number of 
 uncommon species.                     
 The predominant tree of the area,     
 flourishing in the limey soil, is the 
 ash.                                  
 From the present tree cover, it would 
 not be easily recognised that this    
 area was once part of the great       
 deciduous forest of Wensleydale.      
 The trees now come under the          
 protection of the{Yorkshire Dales     
{National Park.
