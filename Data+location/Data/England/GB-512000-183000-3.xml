		<title>03RECTORY PARK</title>
		<content> Rectory Park covers much of our square
 kilometre. It is an expanse of        
 grassland measuring approximately 3   
 acres which is open to the public use 
 at any time and for any purpose.      
 Children can be seen there after      
 school and at weekends enjoying their 
 games. Joggers exercise around the    
 park and of course it is an ideal     
 place to walk a dog! There are cricket
 stands for that relaxing game on a    
 sunny Sunday afternoon; goalposts for 
 budding international soccer players  
 and pitches for rugby and American    
 Football. For the younger age group   
 there are swings,slides,climbing      
 frames,sand pit and monkey bars. If   
 you don't feel so energetic, why not  
 come to Rectory Park to relax? On a   
 hot summers day,bring your swimsuit to
 sunbathe. You could bring a picnic and
 sit and watch the world go by.        </content>
