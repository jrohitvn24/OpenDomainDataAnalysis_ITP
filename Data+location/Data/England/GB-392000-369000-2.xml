		<title>02An Impression of Sutton</title>
		<content> Our names are Emma Kelly and Laura    
 Richardson.We both live on the Seddons
 estate in Sutton.We go to Hollinhey   
 C.P.School.                           
 From our houses we can see many hills 
 and fields.We can also see the church 
 of Sutton St.James which has the old  
 school and the scout hut which we     
 use,nearby                            
 If we are sent on an errand we can    
 walk to the local shop which is a     
 general store which sells nearly      
 everything and is also a post office. 
 We usually play in our gardens but    
 there are playing fields at Cop       
 Meadow.                               
 From the estate we can see Sutton     
 Hall,an old Tudor building, now a     
 hotel.On our way to school we pass the
 village war memorial,which is near the
 Rossendale which joins the Bollin     
 River at Gurnett.We like living here. </content>
