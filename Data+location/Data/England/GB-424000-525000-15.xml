		<content> Shildon railway stands alone          
 Dirty, ragged, unused tracks,         
 All rusty and black.                  
 Sleepers whose bolts are ever so      
 slack, amid the decaying, dreary      
 sight.                                
 It's so sad that it's left to rust.   
 The buildings are cracked and covered 
 in dust.                              
 Slowly changing to a ghost town.      
 Will it eventually all fall down?     
 As I peered down from the wooden      
 bridge,                               
 I  imagined the locos thundering by.  
 Clouds of steam and burning coal      
 Created an immense dust bowl.         
 It was noisy and busy, men laboured,  
 their heads dizzy.                    
 Two of the tracks were shining bright.
 The only survivors which still are    
 used.                                 
 They are not dirty, ragged or bruised.</content>
