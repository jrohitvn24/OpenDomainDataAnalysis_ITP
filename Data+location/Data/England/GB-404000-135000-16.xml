		<content> The A36 trunk road runs through the   
 valley and so the villages are better 
 served by buses than some rural areas.
 There are three Wilts.and Dorset      
 services and one by Beeline Coaches.  
   The Wilts.and Dorset services are   
 the 248,270-273,and the X41 fast inter
 city bus.These services provide a bus 
 nearly every two hours for most of the
 day,from Monday to Saturday.Beeline   
 Coaches run service 25 which provides 
 one bus on Tuesday and two on         
 Saturday.                             
   Service X41,Salisbury to Bristol,   
 follows the A36.Service 270,Salisbury 
 to Bath branches off onto the B3083.  
 The other services are local from     
 Salisbury.                            
   The railway passes through Wishford 
 but there is no train service to any  
 of the villages.
