		<title>03CLUBS IN WENHAM AND RAYDON</title>
		<content>Many over sixties in Wenham are members
of the Forgetmenot Club which meets    
every Wednesday afternoon in Capel     
St.Mary village hall.Most members play 
Whist for about an hour and then have  
tea and biscuits for half an hour when 
they chat and exchange news with       
friends.They then play a game of Bingo.
Members often take homegrown fruit,    
flowers and plants to be sold to other 
members,the proceeds going towards     
funds to pay for outings to the seaside
or places of interest.Funds are also   
raised by a Christmas Fair and coffee  
mornings.                              
Some ladies in Wenham and Raydon belong
to the Women's Institute.Although      
neither has it's own Institute there is
one at Holton and one at Capel St.Mary.
This is a national organisation        
comprising 9192 institutes with links  
worldwide through A.C.W.W.             </content>
