		<content> Open space is the main feature of     
 Greenhow with views over endless      
 distance of hills on all sides.  Few  
 houses and farms are widely scattered 
 over high bleakly exposed inhospitable
 moorland ridge.  Land is unproductive 
 only supporting few sheep and young   
 cattle.  The only employer is a small 
 quarry deveastating the landscape.    
 Farmhouses, derelict for years, now   
 fetch high prices, a new populatin of 
 professional people are moving in.    
 Much money is needed to lay miles of  
 waterpipes, vehicle access etc. Local 
 individual craftsmen help owners do   
 rebuilding to high standard taking    
 years to complete.  Skill and Mod-cons
 can make these comfortable homes but  
 all life is dominated by extremes of  
 weather.  It takes tough spirit to    
 live here and people have ruggedly    
 independent character.                </content>
