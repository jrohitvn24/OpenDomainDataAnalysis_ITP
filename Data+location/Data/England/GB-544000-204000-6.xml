		<title>06THE SHRUBBERY AND CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The Shrubbery is the headquarters of  
 the West Essex Farmers Group.To look  
 after the varied crops they employ an 
 agronomist,Jeremy Finiss.He gives     
 advice on fertilisers and sprays.     
 The main use of the                   
 Shrubbery,however,is to help the      
 farmers market their products.The     
 Group has used the Shrubbery premises 
 since 1980.                           
 The Victorian chapel next door,which  
 had been disused for 21 years,was     
 knocked down and the land now belongs 
 to the Shrubbery.Some of the bricks   
 from the chapel were used to extend   
 the building recently.
