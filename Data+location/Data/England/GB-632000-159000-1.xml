		<title>01RICHBOROUGH CASTLE</title>
		<content>{Richborough Castle}is a{Roman Fort}   
 built late in the{3rd Century}on the  
 highest land in this area, overlooking
 the{River Stour.}Most of its walls    
 remain surrounded by ditches. It is   
 administered by the{Department of the 
{Environment}and is supervised by a    
 custodian who lives in a single       
 storied house which also contains a   
 small museum of Roman archeological   
 finds. In 1985{Mrs Mary Drake}was     
 custodian. Although the site is       
 isolated and very bleak in winter, she
 did not mind the lonliness. The       
 impressive walls of the castle, and   
 the views from the site make this an  
 unusual and interesting job.
