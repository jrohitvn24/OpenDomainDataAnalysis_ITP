The farmhouse, formerly a public  house
is about 200 years old. It is built  of
red   brick  with  a  large   farmhouse
kitchen,  lounge  and  four   bedrooms.
There are several outbuildings for fuel
and storage purposes.                  
Some of the outhouses have been modern-
ised  and  now  consist of  a  cowshed,
milking  parlour and holding yard.  The
holding yard is an open compound  where
the cows are kept in winter.           
The  manpower on the farm  includes  Mr
Taylor, a full-time worker who lives in
and another worker on a Youth  Training
Scheme.  These workers run  the  eighty
acre  Coton  Clanford Farm,  the  fifty
acre  Stocking  Gate Farm  and  another
farm  at Seighford of one  hundred  and
eighty acres.
