		<title>10KNOB FARM RIPLEY DERBYSHIRE.</title>
		<content> Knob Farm near Ripley is small.The    
 farmer is Mr Allen.He has 83 acres    
 which is mainly sown grass with a     
 little rough grazing.He does not find 
 it hard to farm near Ripley but the   
 land isn't very good for growing crops
 because a lot of his land has been    
 opencast mined and then 10 years ago  
 the A38 was built through his farm,and
 he has to use a footbridge to get over
 the A38 to his fields on the other    
  side.He owns the farm which is about 
 150 years old.He owns a baler,3       
 tractors,a muck spreader,a fertilizer 
 sprayer and a hay turner.He keeps cows
 sheep and chickens and sells          
 eggs,milk,wool and meat.The meat goes 
 to FMC at Swanwick and the wool goes  
 to Bradford.He milks the cows and     
 feeds the animals in winter on silage 
 and hay cut in the summer and stored  
 for the winter.                       </content>
