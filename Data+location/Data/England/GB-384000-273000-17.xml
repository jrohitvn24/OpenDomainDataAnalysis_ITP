		<content>   {Stone Manor}was built in 1926 as an
 eight-bedroomed house.  It now has    
 two banqueting suites, a pool, tennis 
 courts, and a French restaurant.      
 Dover sole there costs Â£13.50, and our
 mums and dads go there for special    
 occasions and dances.  The bedrooms   
 have separate bathrooms, and from the 
 top rooms you can see out over all our
 Domesday block.  At{The Granary}you   
 can pile your plate as high as you    
 like, and come back for more. {The    
{Dog}at Harvington used to be a pub;   
 now it does good bar food and caters  
 for private parties.  There's a       
 restaurant as well.  The place which  
 most of the families use is {The      
{Beefeater}at the {Mare and Colt.}     
 There is a big garden for children,   
 and a play area.  Children can have a 
 "Mr Men" meal for under a pound before
 7:30.                                 </content>
