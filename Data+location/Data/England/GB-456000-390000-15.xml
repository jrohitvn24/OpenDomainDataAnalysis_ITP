		<title>15Limestone Hill Mill</title>
		<content> The mill is a listed building.A 100   
 years ago it was renovated.Then a Mr. 
{Wrigglesworth}and his family moved in.
 The building is made of Roche Abbey   
 Quarry Stone.{Today}there is a lot    
 more water than ever before.This comes
 from a nearby Pit where a well was    
 found.The colliery water is cleaned.  
 The waterwheel is dove-tailed into    
 straight walls.It has 6 buckets which 
 are{undershot.}When the wheel was at  
 work it sounded like horses'hoofs.Its 
 diameter is 7m and its width is 3m.   
 The cogs used,alternate{iron with wood
 to prevent friction and wear.Upstairs 
 there is a millstone and some         
 equipment for starting the wheel.On   
 the third floor there is only a chain 
 for lifting the sacks and some grain. 
 The{atmosphere}was of{'time'}having   
 remained stationary.
