		<title>17Walks Around Southwell</title>
		<content>  There is a walk around{Southwell }   
 called {The Westhorpe Circular. }You  
 can buy leaflets about it from        
 Southwell library. To start this walk 
 you start at {Cotmoor Lane End,}which 
 is down {Oxton Road.}For the first    
 quarter of a mile the lane is a hard  
 core track with wide green verges.The 
 path continues as a green lane with   
 deep ruts which {can be wet in dry    
{weather.}Continue until reaching the  
 far side of the first wood on the left
 hand side (this wood is now scarcely  
 more than a few trees along the edge  
 of the lane) These directions are only
 a few from the booklet available. The{
{Southwell Trial}is a disused railway, 
 a few signs of the track can still be 
 seen, such as, part of the rails and  
 the station house.{The Trail}runs     
 through to {Farnsfield.}It is         
 approximately {five miles }long.      </content>
