		<content> Interesting people have been          
 interviewed about the area and how it 
 has changed over the years. There used
 to be two schools, now there is only  
 one. The main means of transport used 
 to be pony and trap but most people   
 used bicycles.                        
 Farming was the main industry and     
 remains so today but it is no longer a
 big employer of local labour.         
 Quarrying of limestone and copper has 
 long ceased. Hope House used to be the
 Miners Arms pub and served the miners 
 and quarrymen in its day.             
 Most local people kept a pig and in   
 1913 there was a cobbler, shopkeeper, 
 joiner, grocer,tea dealer, dressmaker,
 market gardener and blacksmith in the 
 village. Many changes have taken place
 and no doubt these changes will       
 continue into the future.
