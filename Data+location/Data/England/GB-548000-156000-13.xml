		<content> Churches in our area are the Free     
 Church, St. John the Divine, &amp; a small
 chapel in Dunton Green, &amp; St. Mary's  
 at Riverhead. The Free Church was     
 built in 1932 and is used a lot by    
 bodies such as Scouts and Girls'      
 Brigade. Riverhead &amp; D.G. formerly 2  
 church communities, are now one parish
 and St. John's, built in 1890 with a  
 Â£500 contribution from Samuel Wreford,
 from a family of silk merchants, is   
 closed now &amp; local worshippers share  
 the use of the Free Church. At        
 Riverhead some 200 attend service &amp; an
 area is being made in the church for  
 daytime use. Lord Amherst's family are
 buried in the churchyard.             
 At Chevening,St.Botolph's church is   
 old and has always been associated    
 with Chevening Estate
