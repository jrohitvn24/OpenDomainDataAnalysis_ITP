		<content> Most people in the block are either   
 connected with farming or commute to  
 London or nearby towns. There are     
 those who have lived in the area all  
 their life &amp; those only for a few     
 years. Most of the inhabitants fall   
 into the{middle to upper class        
{bracket.}Some need to work hard for   
 the essentials, others employ domestic
 staff. There are a few unemployed     
 people - mainly youngsters.{Most      
{houses are owner occupied}with{2 cars 
 (a car is almost essential in this    
 rural area). There are several 'big   
 houses' but the people mainly live in 
 cottages. A number of youngsters have 
 'nannies', own their own ponies or    
 attend private schools. With the lack 
 of amenities &amp; the cost of housing the
 area tends to attract middle-aged or  
 older inhabitants rather than young   
 parents with children.                </content>
