		<content> THE EAST ESSEX GAZETTE IS PART OF     
 ESSEX COUNTY NEWSPAPERS, A CONSORTIUM 
 WHICH PUBLISHES BOTH WEEKLY AND DAILY 
 LOCAL PAPERS. THE CLACTON OFFICE IS   
 LINKED BY COMPUTER WITH COLCHESTER AND
 NEWS CAN BE TRANSFERRED QUICKLY.      
  THE EDITOR TOLD US THAT IT COSTS     
 ABOUT 70P TO PRINT EACH PAPER BUT IT  
 ONLY COSTS 17P FOR US TO BUY.THE COST 
 IS REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF   
 ADVERTISING SOLD.  A FULL PAGE ADVERT 
 COSTS Â£600-Â£700 . THE  NUMBER OF PAGES
 OF NEWS DEPENDS ALSO ON THE AMOUNT OF 
 ADVERTISING SOLD.                     
   THE GAZETTE  SUCCESSFULLY CAMPAIGNED
 FOR THE RETENTION OF THE CLACTON      
 MATERNITY UNIT WHEN IT WAS THREATENED 
 WITH CLOSURE, A MOVE WHICH WOULD HAVE 
 MEANT EXPECTANT MOTHERS IN FRINTON    
 TRAVELLING TO COLCHESTER. VANDALISM,  
 DOG-FOULING AND LOCAL PLANNING ISSUES 
 FEATURE REGULARLY ON THE LETTERS PAGE.</content>
