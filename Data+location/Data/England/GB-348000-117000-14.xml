   I have lived in Montacute all of my 
 life and it has become my ultimate    
 surroundings.                         
   Montacute is a well preserved       
 village and is fairly quiet.This week 
 is the  carnival week and as one would
 expect  everyone is rallying round to 
 make the week as enjoyable as any     
 other events throughout the year.     
   On the Monday that has just past a  
 special ceremony was held for the     
 crowning of the carnival queen, in the
 shape of Marianne King, who had been  
 selected by two judges after speaking 
 to all the contestants.               
   Wednesday brought a wheelbarrow race
 which anyone could enter. Darren Saint
 &amp; I entered the younger section and as
 a result came first.
