		<title>09LIFE AT HOME</title>
		<content> Life at home is rather simple until   
 you start cleaning.The real problem   
 as you get older life gets harder.    
 As time passes more economical things 
 are invented,hoovers for instance they
 are alot better to use than brushes,  
 because you can do hoovering quicker. 
 Irons: they dont have to be heated by 
 the fire like the olden days.Things   
 today are making life easy for us all.
 TV is also clever because they can get
 news all round the world,some people  
 say they would rather give up talking 
 to their parents.When you are young   
 you really just play.When you are old 
 enough to get a job and make money    
 some people think themselves to be    
 lazy and they throw money around like 
 candy floss.Some companys give their  
 business men cars to use,whereas      
 others dont.House wives stay at home  
 and clean the house up.               </content>
