		<title>01FARMING in BLINDCRAKE</title>
		<content>   There are 12 farms in this area     
 ranging in size from 30 to 600 acres. 
 All are family farms run by fathers   
 and sons with 6 or so employees and   
 some seasonal casual labour. The land 
 is not suitable for arable farming,any
 cereals grown being used on the farm. 
 Grass is used for pasture or conserved
 as hay or silage.                     
   Farming is mainly mixed with dairy, 
 suckler beef and sheep. There are 6   
 dairy herds of mainly Freisans, aver- 
 age 60 head, housed in cubicle sheds  
 and traditional byres. The milk is    
 made into cheese at Aspatria.         
   Sheep flocks range from 50 to 800   
 head of mainly Swaledale ewes crossed 
 with Suffolk or Blue Leicester. Fat   
 lambs are sold in the local markets of
 Cockermouth, Wigton, Penrith and      
 Carlisle.
