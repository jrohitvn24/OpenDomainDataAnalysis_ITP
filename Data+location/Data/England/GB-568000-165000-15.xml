		<title>15Life as a Gamekeeper</title>
		<content>{Mrs Graves}and her husband, a         
{gamekeeper,}live at{Ranscombe Farm,   
 which lies north of Cuxton.  Mrs      
 Graves says that their incubators hold
 ten thousand pheasant eggs each.  They
 hatch the eggs for other people as    
 well as for their own Shoot.  They    
 expect about 50% of the eggs to hatch.
 Their quietest period is between      
 February and May.  When the eggs begin
 to hatch, by the third week in May,   
 they work twenty four hours a day     
 until the season ends on 1st February.
 Pheasants may be shot from October on.
 The Gamekeeper works for a syndicate  
 and the people who go shooting are    
 called "Guns".  The "Guns" are retired
 people, farmers and local business    
 men.  A Gamekeeper works hard, often  
 going in the six thousand acres of    
 woods at night to look for{poachers}or
 rising early to check the chicks.     </content>
