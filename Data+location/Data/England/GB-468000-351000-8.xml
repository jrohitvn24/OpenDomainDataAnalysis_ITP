		<title>08SOUTHWELL MINSTER</title>
		<content> When we went to The Minster it was a  
 cold afternoon. We tried to get in by 
 the north door but it was locked. So  
 we went through the west door. We went
 on a guided tour through the Minster  
 by a verger whose name was Mrs.       
 Hudson. The font is one of the first  
 things you should see as you come in  
 through the north door. It is put near
 the front of the Minster or any church
 because it is the beginning of life.  
 In 1661 the font had to be built again
 because{Oliver Cromwell}did not       
 believe in children and babies being  
 baptised. The altar is at the end of  
 the nave, it is where parents go to   
 get bread and wine and children get   
 blessed. There is also another altar  
 in the choir and that has mice on it  
 to represent the man who carved out   
 the altar.                            
                                       </content>
