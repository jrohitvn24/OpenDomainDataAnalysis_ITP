		<title>19STUDLAND NATIONAL TRUST</title>
		<content>   The land in and around Studland was 
 bequeathed to the National Trust by   
 the Bankes family in 1982,one of the  
 largest gifts the charity has ever    
 received.The Trust now has control    
 over rents of local farms and is now  
 running the new information centre,   
 car parks, toilets and cafes along the
 beach.Four people are employed full   
 -time and 10-12 part-time.Car-parks   
 are to remain the present size in     
 order to limit the number of visitors.
 The Trust is conscious of the need to 
 preserve the environment from the     
 ravages of the visitors.Paths,dunes   
 and trackways are being erroded, and  
 litter is a constant problem.The Trust
 aims to balance the desire of the     
 public to visit the beach against the 
 needs of the nearby  Nature Reserve   
 for tranquility.
