		<title>13THE DARWIN YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content> Mr. Stan Williams has been running the
 youth club for five years. He is a    
 full time youth leader and he is paid 
 by the Local Education Authority. The 
 youth club is also financed by the    
 L.E.A. who also pay for the decoration
 repair of the building and wages of 14
 staff. The number of staff varies     
 throughout the year. Extra money for  
 pinball machines, running of the      
 coffee bar, discos and trips has to be
 paid for from the club's own funds.   
 These funds come from admissions and  
 coin operated machines in the club.   
 The club is open four times a week for
 young people from Breadsall and       
 Chaddesden.                           
 Stan enjoys his work and on the whole 
 the behaviour of the young people is  
 good, but local residents are often   
 critical of the teenagers' high       
 spirits.               {Cont. Page 14 </content>
