		<content> A level plain draining gradually into 
 a river is not of itself dramatic, but
 the variety of trees and              
 well-weathered brick and black and    
 white housees ensure that the general 
 aspect is pleasing to the eye.        
 The trees and woods are mostly        
 deciduous but there are some confiers 
 and holly.  Elms no longer survive but
 Oak, Ash and Sycamore abound, and most
 houses have decorative trees - Copper 
 Beech, Yews, Laburnum and Rowan as    
 well as fruit trees.  The river banks 
 offer, by way of contrast, Willow,    
 Alder and Sedge Willow.  Spraying has 
 reduced the variety of wayside and    
 meadow flowers, but Spring and Summer 
 produce Lesser Celandine, Meadowsweet,
 Campion, Honeysuckle and Wild Roses.
