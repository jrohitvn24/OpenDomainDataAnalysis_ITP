		<title>13HOUSES IN BUCKNALL</title>
		<content> There are 82{houses}and utility       
 buildings in Bucknall.                
                                       
 The only stone building is the{Church 
 of St Margaret's.  It is also the only
 building with rosemary tiles.         
                                       
 30 of the buildings were single       
 storey, and 52 were 2 storey.         
 There are no houses with more than 2  
 storeys.                              
                                       
 Most of the houses have been built    
 since 1950, but there are many from   
 earlier this century and a few that   
 are more than one hundred years old.  
                                       
 Unlike{Horsington,}there is no        
 thatched cottage.  Most roofs are     
 concrete tiles (53), but 11 are slate,
 15 are pantiled and 2 are felted.
