		<title>19Fordton Mill.</title>
		<content> Fordton Mill is a very small place. It
 is 28 years old, the mill is on top of
 a river, the river Yeo. The buildings 
 in the mill are mostly made of brick. 
 In the mill the barley, wheat and     
 vitamins go in to the big tanks, then 
 it gets ground and comes out in the   
 weight that you want it to.           
 The owner of the mill is Mr Gulley. He
 has lived at the mill for 20 years.   
 The mill produces food for Pigs, Cows,
 Poultry, Lambs, Calves, Horses and    
 Dairy uses. The ingriedients for raw  
 products are Fish neckter, barley,    
 wheat,molaun, maize, gluten, bone     
 meal and soya. The milk quota has an  
 effect on the mill. They had to change
 grassfeed and dairyfeed and this has  
 effected the animals health.
