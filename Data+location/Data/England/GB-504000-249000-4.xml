		<content> I wake up on Friday morning .I like   
 this day, I like it because, for one  
 it,s swimming and two there's no      
 school tomorrow! I catch a bus that   
 leaves at 8.05am. It goes through     
 Dunton , Biggleswade (which is my     
 stop) Ickwell, Northill, Damealice    
 Bedford bus station and B.M.S. After  
 Assembly we have a test, sometimes a  
 Maths test, sometimes spelling. After 
 that we go swimming, we run down from 
 school over the Bridge and down Slade 
 Walk. When we get there we split into 
 two groups, one that can swim and the 
 other that can't. I am in Mr Whitwhans
 group, ones that can swim. After      
 swimming we have Maths, which is not  
 always popular. After Maths it's Lunch
 Break when we play football. After    
 break it's  Geography, which is all   
 right. After that it's home, I stay   
 late to catch the bus.                </content>
