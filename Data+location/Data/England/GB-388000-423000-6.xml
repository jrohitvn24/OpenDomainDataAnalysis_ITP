		<content> The{Amateur Astronomy Centre}has begun
 to develop in the last two or three   
 years on the middle site of the former
 pipe works on Bacup Road. It was      
 established by a group of members with
 the intention of developing the site  
 over a number of years. So far the    
 group has built a{Camera Obscura,}a   
{Planetarium}and a{Thirty inch         
{telescope.}The group is in the process
 of building an{observatory}to house a 
 forty inch telescope with a darkroom, 
 meeting room and other facilities. It 
 is hoped that this will be finished by
 the end of 1985. There are further    
 plans to develop the site with an {   
{educational centre and shop}to attract
 non-members to the centre. It is also 
 intended to mount the{thirty inch     
{telescope}as a mobile telescope making
 it (currently) the largest mobile     
 telescope in the world.               </content>
