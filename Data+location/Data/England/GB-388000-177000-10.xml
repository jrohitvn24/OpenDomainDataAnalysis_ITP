		<title>10St Giles Church</title>
		<content>{Mr Walters}has been rector in Stanton 
 for three years. The church was       
 built about 1100 so that makes it     
 about 850 years old. The church gains 
 its name from an ancient baronial     
 family in the North of England,{St.   
{Quentin,}who at one time occupied the 
 Manor house. Mr Walters enjoys his job
 although he has many things to do.    
 Stanton church has only got one       
{stained glass window.}The window shows
 St Matthew and he has 6 toes on his   
 left foot. Mr Walters said that all   
 stained glass windows tell a story.   
 Stanton church's true name is St Giles
 church.                               
 In 1843 an{organ}was purchased for    
 Â£56.10.0 by public subscription. This 
 was replaced by a new instrument in   
 1874, built by King of Islington. It  
 cost Â£120, and was placed on the North
 side of the chancel.                  </content>
