		<content> On Sunday mornings the children get up
 at 10.30a.m. and have a cup of tea.   
 They do the "bottling-up"-this is     
 checking on the number of bottles     
 needed to fill the shelves and visit- 
 ing the cellar to stock up. The       
 bottles are cleaned and placed on the 
 shelves. The children clean the living
 rooms with the vacuum cleaner and     
 polish the tops.They stock up with bar
 snacks such as peanuts,crisps,pickled 
 onions and"cheese snips".The bins are 
 emptied and the passage cleaned. Then 
 they sit down with a glass of coke or 
 lemonade while their mother is cooking
 Sunday lunches for the pub customers. 
 Often she makes 30-40 roast meals.They
 set the table at 2.30p.m. for the     
 family to have dinner. Later they help
 to wash the pots and pans and take the
 dog for a walk. Then they watch tele- 
 vision, have supper and go to bed.    </content>
