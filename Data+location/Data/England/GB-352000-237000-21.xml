I attended the school between 1970 and 1974 (aged 7-11). I was from the outskirts of London, Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. At that time the school had 28 students which was increased to 33 boys with an update to one of the rooms. The school also had a Matron and the headmaster during my time was Mr. Haywood.  On occasion some of the students went to see football matches when Arsenal played somewhat locally (disliked Arsenal - i'm a Spurs fan!) as the headmaster was an Arsenal fan.  Once a year 6 or so students at a time spent a week in Tenby, Wales, as the headmaster or the School, I'm not sure which had a property there.   &lt;br />
