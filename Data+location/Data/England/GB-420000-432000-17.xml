		<content>    Pudsey is well served with leisure 
 activities.In Pudsey Park,which was   
 opened in 1889,there is lovely        
 scenery and a play-ground with swings,
 slides and a steamroller for children 
 to clamber over.New additions are in  
 the development stage.                
    Pudsey has no cinema now,but once  
 it had three.While there is no        
 professional theatre there is a wide  
 variety of amateur productions.Pudsey 
 has its own arts festival,too - The   
 Simeon Gaunt Memorial Festival.Pudsey 
 Civic Hall is the venue for dances,   
 concerts,discos and receptions.There  
 are numerous youth clubs in the area. 
 Youth is also catered for by Scouts,  
 Guides,Boys' Brigade and Air Training 
 Corps - all with many branches.
