		<title>01Peat Moors South of Wedmore</title>
		<content> All the south of block is on the      
 Westhay Peat Moor just 5 mtrs above   
 sea level. This area is drained by a  
 system of deep Rhynes or ditches,     
 pumps and sluices prevent flooding.   
 Rhynes are the field boundaries.      
 Intensive indusrial extracction of    
 peat and its transportation has caused
 the roads which run north, south      
 across the moor to deteriorate and    
 subside to the extent that 6 from 8   
 are downgraded to green lane or 'road 
 used as public path status'.  The rest
 of this area is used for rough grazing
 of cattle and a little market         
 gardening. The few inhabitants sell   
 bags of peat from their garages. To   
 the north the land rises sharply to   
 70 metres above sea level, with better
 pastures and a ribbon of development  
 on the Wedmore 11Wells Road
