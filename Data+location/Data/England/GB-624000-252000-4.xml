		<title>04Bredfield Village hall.</title>
		<content>     The people of Bredfield built the 
village hall doing all the foundations,
brickwork, woodwork and painting       
themselves. All the money was raised   
by coffee mornings, jumble sales,      
fetes, dances and donations organised  
by the people who use the hall, which  
includes the school and adult classes. 
     Inside there is a large hall with 
a stage, a bar, a cloakroom, toilets, a
store cupboard and a kitchen which has 
an ordinary oven, a microwave oven, a  
fridge and plenty of cupboards with    
crockery that people can use, and a    
first aid kit.                         
     Behind the village hall there is a
public playing field, with two tennis  
courts, a small pavilion for the       
tennis club and a football pitch. In   
front of the hall there is a bowling   
green with a pavilion.
