		<title>17Wortley-Traffic Problems</title>
		<content> Wortley lies on the road from Halifax 
 to Sheffield. It is a busy, main road 
 and is dangerous because of a narrow  
 double bend by the church. Sometimes  
 big lorries with wide loads get stuck 
 and there are nasty accidents. The    
 lorries are coming from the           
 steelworks. It is very difficult to   
 cross the road because of all the     
 traffic. Soon a by-pass will be built 
 so that the lorries will not have to  
 use the village. Some people object   
 because the road will cross their     
 land. Before there were buses and cars
 people used to travel by rail. They   
 had to use a path down the fields to  
 the station where they could catch a  
 steam train. About 20 years ago the   
 railway station was closed. Most      
 people now have cars but those who    
 don't have to rely on the bus which   
 passes through the village.           </content>
