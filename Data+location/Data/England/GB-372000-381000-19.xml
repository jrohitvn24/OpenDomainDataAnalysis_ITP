{ THE CHURCH, BEAUTIFULLY SITUATED     
{OVERLOOKING THE MERE,}SEEMS TOO BIG   
 FOR SUCH A SMALL VILLAGE BUT IN THE   
 PAST ROSTHERNE WAS THE MOTHER CHURCH  
 FOR KNUTSFORD AND A LARGE PARISH.     
  THE CHURCH WAS IN EXISTENCE BEFORE   
 1188 WITH{A STONE TOWER ADDED IN 1533.
 IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEN THAT THERE WAS  
 TROUBLE WITH THE BELLS. ONE BELL KEPT 
 SLIDING DOWN THE HILL AND A WORKMAN   
 SAID 'I WOULD THE DEVIL HAD THEE';THE 
 BELL ROLLED OVER HIM AND INTO THE     
 LAKE, GIVING RISE TO THE {LEGEND}THAT 
 EVERY YEAR AT EASTER A MERMAID SWIMS  
 UP FROM THE SEA BY SUBTERRANEAN       
 PASSAGES TO RING THE BELL.AN UNLIKELY 
 TALE BUT{SMELT, A SALT WATER FISH}HAVE
 BEEN CAUGHT IN THE MERE WHICH IS      
 UNUSUALLY DEEP, ABOUT 30 METERS.      
  THE COAT OF ARMS OF THE MERE FAMILY  
 OF MERE HAD A CREST SHOWING A MERMAID.</content>
