		<title>02FARM SURVEY</title>
		<content>    Our class carried out a survey of  
 all the farms within this area of the 
 map. We first of all drew up a        
 questionnaire to find out how the land
 was used. We sent an explanatory      
 letter, the questionnaire and a map to
 each farmer, with a request for them  
 to fill in all the details, mark the  
 extent of the farm on the map, and    
 return the information to us for      
 collation. Some of the farmers were   
 visited by groups of children.        
    The percentage of land in this area
 used for the various crops was as     
 follows:                              
 GRAZING 49%,SILAGE 30%,HAY 6%,GRAINS  
 15%.                                  
    Althogh a variety of stock was kept
 such as a few ducks and hens these    
 were for home uses. Almost all the    
 farmers kept dairy herds, while on the
 higher groundsome farmers kept sheep. </content>
