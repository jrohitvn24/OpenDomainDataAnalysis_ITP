		<title>11Bee Keeping</title>
		<content>    Mr Reed lives at 8, West End       
 Rd.(grid ref.996038). Mrs Reed works  
 as a domestic help at{Bradninch       
 Primary School. Mr Reed is retired. He
 owns a large garden. His hobbies are  
 shooting, gardening and keeping{bees. 
 He has been keeping bees for 44 years.
 At the top of his long garden he keeps
 24 hives.                             
    There are about 20,000 bees in each
 hive. When we visited in June we saw a
 swarm of bees hanging from a tree     
 (they were keeping the Queen Bee warm 
 in the middle). Mr Reed has seen 10   
 swarms whilst he has kept bees. The   
 bees fly around wild and feed on      
 dandilion and clover in the Culm      
 Valley. From these bees, Mr Reed gets 
 400lbs of honey a year. He{sells}it   
 locally in 1lb jars (with his own name
 on the label) for Â£1 per jar. He makes
 about Â£400 a year.                    </content>
