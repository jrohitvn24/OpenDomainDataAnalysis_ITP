		<content> At the North end of Angmering, most of
 the houses are semi-detached, at an   
 average cost of Â£41,520 with 8 rooms, 
 and terraced houses at an average cost
 of Â£39,900 with 7 rooms.  They are in 
 modern estates, built 10-20 years ago 
 which have been growing rapidly as the
 population of Angmering increases.    
                                       
 The 1981 census showed a population of
 5 300 in Angmering alone, so more     
 houses must be built to accommodate   
 the influx of people.  There are only 
 a few detached houses in Angmering as 
 they are more expensive.              
                                       
 North of the A27 there are more       
 detached houses.  Some, like the decoy
 cottage, date back to the 1600's. A   
 typical house in the area has 3       
 bedrooms, a spacious kitchen, lounge, 
 dining room, garage and garden.       </content>
