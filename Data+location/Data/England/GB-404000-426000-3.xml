		<content>{Farming in Wainstalls}                
 Most of the farming in this area is   
 sheep farming.  Sheep are reared for  
 wool and meat.  Several farmers also  
 keep cows and these are mostly for    
 dairy products and beef.  There is one
 chicken farmer and there was until    
 recently a piggery but this has now   
 closed down.                          
 There is virtually no arable farming  
 around here.  The farmed land is      
 mostly turned over to grass for       
 hay-making or silage with the         
 occasional crop of cow cabbage.       
 As well as this professional farming, 
 a pattern has shown up of quite a     
 number of people keeping a few animals
 for their own use.  These include     
 hens, geese, rabbits and goats.  Many 
 people also grow their own vegetables 
 and a little soft fruit in sheltered  
 areas.                                </content>
