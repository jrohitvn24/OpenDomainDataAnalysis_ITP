		<title>04Kimbolton School (Past)</title>
		<content>    References to what was known for   
 centuries as the{'Free Grammar School 
{of Kimbolton'}have been found as far  
 back as 1530.The rent from a small    
 endowment of land and buildings paid  
 "an honest schoolmaster".             
    For most of its history the school 
 buildings stood round the western     
 perimeter of the churchyard, and it   
 fulfilled its purpose of educating the
 boys within a radius of about 10      
 miles, although there was a boarding  
 element that housed  sons of farmers  
 from a greater distance.A regular     
 number of boys entered Cambridge      
 colleges,particularly St. Johns.      
    From 1876 the school was centred on
 new buildings at the western end of   
 the village, but the last 40 years    
 have witnessed the most dramatic      
 changes in the school's history.
