		<content>     Many of the people who live in    
{Mousehole}leave the village each day  
 to go to work.  Work in the village   
 itself is mainly on the service       
 industries such as plumbing, painters 
 and decorators, electricians and      
 suchlike.  Also there are the         
 shopkeepers, publicans, hoteliers and 
 cafe owners who employ others to serve
 the local community and, especially in
 the summer, the visitors.

 artists colony in{Mousehole}and much  
 of their work is displayed for sale to
 the summer visitors. {Lamorna}also has
 quite a large number of artists who
