 Mrs H. is looked after in a elderly   
 persons' home.She was born in 1884 and
 moved to this area 6 years ago.She    
 likes this area because it is         
 peaceful.Her only living relative is a
 niece, 70 yrs old, but Mrs H. remains 
 cheerful.She got married in her late  
 fifties and was a nurse in the 1st    
 World War,earning a halfcrown a       
 week.Her grandfather was a farmer and 
 used to smoke a clay pipe.She used to 
 wash her clothes by hand and was not  
 allowed to use makeup.She lived two   
 miles from school and walked that     
 journey four times a day.Mrs H.used to
 drive a one horse wagonette for       
 transport.The greatest changes of her 
 life were radio/television.She doesn't
