 Coal has been mined extensively in the
 area in the past.The last mines closed
 in the mid_twentieth century.         
  In 1750,one of the first Newcomen    
 atmospheric engines was installed at  
 Paulton Engine pit,for pumping water. 
 The Somerset Coal Canal from  Paulton 
 to the Kennet and Avon Canal was      
 opened in 1805.The W.Evans foundry    
 operated at Paulton Engine.It produced
 gates,fencing and posts which can     
 still be seen in the area. Mining     
 equipment and pumps were also made.   
  The footwear industry developed as a 
 cottage industry.Ashman Brothers shoe 
 factory continues this traditon to the
 present day.                          
  In 1830 a small printing press was   
 established.It grew to become the     
 main industry and largest employer in 
 the area ,Purnells Ltd.               </content>
