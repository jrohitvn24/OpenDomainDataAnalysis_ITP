		<title>03Transport in Halewood.</title>
		<content>     Although two main railways pass   
 through Halewood there are no stations
 as the only station closed in 1952.   
 There have been plans to reopen the   
 station but for the time being these  
 proposals have been shelved.          
     Halewood does, however, have good 
 bus services. There are a total of    
 eleven services calling in the town.  
 Some of these services run at peak    
 hours only but the majority run       
 throughout the day.                   
     The destinations of the buses are 
 varied. They travel to Liverpool,     
 Chester, St Helens, Runcorn, Speke,   
 Garston, Kirkby, Crosby and various   
 other local destinations.             
     Many people use the bus services  
 to Hunts Cross to catch the newly     
 opened railway service into Liverpool,
 Southport and Kirkby.
