The soil of the area is generally      
sandy and the crops grown are:  sugar  
beet, barley, wheat, carrots, oil seed 
rape since 1982, and potatoes.  Apples 
and blackcurrants are also grown.      
                                       
Extensive irrigation with huge machines
pumping water from the farmer's own    
reservoir is necessary to produce crops
counteract "dust-blow", a problem      
exacerbated by the removal of hedges in
recent years.  In some cases these are 
now being replanted.                   
                                       
Pigs are intensively reared in modern  
units at the Rookery Farm.  Red deer   
are also found in the area.  There were
8 in 1983, and they now number 36.
