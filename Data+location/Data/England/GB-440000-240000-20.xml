		<title>20Wroxton Abbey grounds</title>
		<content>Since 1978 the grounds have undergone  
restoration. This includes new tree and
rose planting, tree surgery, clearance 
of scrub and dead wood from vistas, the
Ha-ha, and the Mount, and the repair   
and opening of the dovecote and ice-   
house to the public. The lakes have    
been dredged and re-shaped and the     
grand cascade rebuilt. This has only   
been possible through many private     
donations and the grants from the      
Historic Buildings Council, Stanley    
Smith Horticural Trust, Robinson Trust 
and the Countryside Commission. The    
grounds are now open daily and a pass  
needs to be obtained from reception.   
The students use the grounds for       
outdoor activities such as volleyball. 
Local groups use them for presenting   
open air plays, area Guide activities  
etc. The grounds are full of wild life 
such as swans, deer and squirrels etc. </content>
