		<title>11Village Pubs</title>
		<content> The Pubs play a central part in the   
 life of Owlswick and Longwick.  There 
 are three pubs in Longwick, the Red   
 Lion which has a well recommended     
 dining room, the White Horse, which   
 plays the largest part in village     
 affairs and the Duke of Wellington.  A
 fete is held in the garden of the     
 White Horse in August and a harvest   
 festival in the bars in Autumn, and it
 also provides good food and           
 accommodation.  The Duke of Wellington
 right at the east end of Longwick also
 has its devotees.  A yearly cricket   
 match is played between the regulars  
 of the White Horse and the Red Lion.  
 The Shoulder of Mutton at Owlswick is 
 also a Motel and issues a brochure    
 showing it to be the centre of the    
 South of England.  Business           
 conferences can be held there and many
 facilities are available.             </content>
