		<content> The Mayflower park near the water has 
 always been a popular spot for viewing
 passing ships.                        
   The city's colourful past is        
 reflected by the numerous monuments;  
 these include memorials to the sinking
 of the Titanic, the sailing of the    
 Mayflower and the ruined Holy Rood    
 Church dedicated to merchant seamen.  
   In the area called the New Docks    
 there are six berths, one of which is 
 called the Free Port which is where   
 the old oil tanker, Burmah Endeavour, 
 is kept. There are many sidings       
 leading to each unloading point. The  
 old sheds by them are used only by the
 birds now. Businesses include a timber
 yard,the Martini distributors and Rank
 Hovis with their large grain silos    
 giving a prominent landmark in the    
 area.                                 
                                       </content>
