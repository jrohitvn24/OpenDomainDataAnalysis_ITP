		<title>19Housing in the Meir</title>
		<content>     The majority of houses in the Meir
area are Council houses which were     
built from 1930 onwards.These houses   
are usually semi-detached but sometimes
terraced rows of up to six houses were 
built.There has been in recent years   
construction of modern private houses  
on the outskirts of Meir but the area  
is one of predominantly Council homes. 
     Each house has a garden and       
normally a garage.The average size of  
house is three bedrooms,living room,   
kitchen,inside W.C. and bathroom.They  
arup of redbrick with grey/black clay  
tiled roofs.                           
     Lots of open space  has been left 
in the Meir to provide recreation for  
children There are lots of open greens 
where games can be played.
