		<title>12GROVE HUNT-OFFICERS.</title>
		<content> The Grove and Rufford Hunt is run by a
 committee,which has appointed three   
 Joint Masters who are responsible for 
 the management of the Hunt. The       
 Masters provide part of the finance   
 and the committee raises the remainder
 from amongst the followers who wish to
 hunt. The Masters employ a Huntsman,a 
 Whipper In,two Grooms and a part-time 
 Terrier man.Puppy walkers look after  
 the individual hounds for some        
 months,between leaving their mothers  
 and returning to the pack.            
 An amateur steeple chase,the Grove    
 Point to Point is a major event       
 organised by the Hunt.This event is   
 now well supported and established in 
 its own right.                        
 An annual Puppy Show is also organised
 by the Hunt Masters.
