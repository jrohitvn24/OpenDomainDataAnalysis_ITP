		<title>16WHERE WE GO TO SHOP.</title>
		<content>  Our local shops are chemists,        
 newsagents and off_licences.If we want
 a bigger variety we go to the town a  
 kilometre away. Until 1981 however the
 variety was still not great and many  
 people travelled to Newcastle but     
 since then a lot of development has   
 taken place and a near derelict area, 
 called The Lanes, now attracts people 
 to shop here. Nearly Â£17 million was  
 spent in keeping the character of the 
 old lanes while providing for the     
 requirements of modern shopping.The   
 British Council of Shopping Centres   
 has just voted the centre top in its  
 national survey and the local         
 'Cumberland News' editorial has       
 suggested that the old title for      
 Carlisle,{Railway City}should now be  
 changed to Shopping City.
