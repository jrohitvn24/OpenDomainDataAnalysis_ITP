		<title>02Ide Hill</title>
		<content>   A  renowned beauty spot on the      
 highest point of the West Kent        
 sandstone ridge about four miles S.W. 
 of Sevenoaks and in the 'commuter     
 belt'about 20 miles radius from       
 central London.                       
   From the car park down the hill from
 the village green and behind the      
 village hall there is the most superb 
 view south across the Weald to the    
 South Downs.Two or three miles south  
 the landscape is dominated by the     
 sheet of water that is Bough Beech    
 reservoir.  The immediate terrain of  
 Ide Hill is farmland and woodland so  
 that the traditional sources of       
 employment are agriculture and        
 forestry. Like many other Kentish     
 villages this distance from London it 
 has attracted many commuters and      
 retired business people.
