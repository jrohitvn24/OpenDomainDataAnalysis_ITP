		<title>08MINERS' STRIKE</title>
		<content>  Before the recent mining dispute     
 there was an air of prosperity and    
 wealth in the area, shops were        
 thriving and businesses were          
 expanding, but during the dispute     
 many had to close down.               
                                       
  Collections were made all over the   
 country to buy food for miner's       
 families. Money was sent from abroad, 
 W.Germany, France etc. At Christmas, 9
 months into the strike there was an   
 air of depression, parents were having
 to tell young children that Santa     
 was not coming this year.             
                                       
  At school the children of miners were
 supplied with free meals.Although     
 nothing was ever said,I always felt   
 that others were noticing that we were
 receiving charity.
