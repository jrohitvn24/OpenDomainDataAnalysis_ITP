		<content>The area surveyed can be split into two
particular types of use. The majority  
of land is wooded and meadow, the left 
most parts of the area is residential  
and also has several shopping areas.   
The main shopping area is Sevenoaks    
High Street and there are also more    
shops at the top and bottom of St.     
John's Hill area. Two main roads travel
through the area. One is the A225 which
runs through to Dartford, the other is 
the A25 which takes traffic from the   
Bat and Ball traffic lights through to 
Seal and eventually merges with the    
A20. Knole House is situated on the    
south side of the survey area and has a
large acreage of ground known as Knole 
Park. Another feature of the park is   
the deer for which it is famous.
