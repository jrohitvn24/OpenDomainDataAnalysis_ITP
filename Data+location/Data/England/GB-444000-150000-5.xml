		<title>05BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS</title>
		<content>  In this area of open wheat fields,   
 meadows and woodland,there are over   
 fifty varieties of butterflies.In     
 particular,there are such butterflies 
 as the{Meadow Brown,}the{Gate Keeper,}
 the{Ringlet,}the{Tortoiseshell,}the   
{Red Admiral}and the{Painted Lady.     
  Bradley Wood is privately-owned,and  
 is very old and undisturbed.Therefore 
 many species of moths and butterflies 
 breed there _ amongst the moths there 
 are the{Privet Hawk}moth,the{Eyed Hawk
 moth,the{Convolvulus Hawk}moth,the{   
{Poplar Hawk}moth and the{Lime Hawk}   
 moth.However the keeper brings some of
 the pupae into the house to hatch,    
 after which he releases them back into
 the woods.                            
  Mediterranean species have been seen 
 in these woods and it would appear    
 that this happens when we get warm,   
 south-westerly winds.                 </content>
