		<content> In the village we have a factory that 
 makes plastic goods like toilet       
 seats.My next door neighbour works    
 there.A lot of the people in the      
 village work there.Most people work   
 outside the village in places like    
 Leeds and York and sometimes even     
 further.Most people get there by bus  
 or car.However most people who work in
 public houses are local people as are 
 those who work in local shops.Some    
 people who work in banks or building  
 societies come from outside the       
 village.Other people have their own   
 businesses, such as market gardening  
 and dress-making, which they operate  
 from their homes.Mr. Fountain is      
 selfemployed.He has his own business  
 working with timber.Dixons build      
 houses and extensions for houses and  
 garages.They also built our new       
 cricket pavilion.Unemployment only 3%.</content>
