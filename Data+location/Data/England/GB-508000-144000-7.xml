 Every year we have a Nativity Play.   
 We have it in church.  At the         
 Christmas play we sing carols.  There 
 are decorations round the church.  We 
 have a party at school.  We had a     
 paper chain 46 metres long.  We have  
 games and crackers.  We had ice cream 
 and jelly.  We can come in what we    
 like to a Christmas party.  Also we go
 home early.                           
{Easter.}                              
 At Easter Time we have an egg rolling 
 race and whoever wins gets the egg.   
 We have a line made with chalk to     
 start.  You are not allowed to push   
 your egg down the hill.  Sometimes    
 people give their egg two pushes.     
 After we have had the race we all go  
 round the back on the field and we    
 have and egg hunt.  We get little eggs
 and we put them into our baskets.     </content>
