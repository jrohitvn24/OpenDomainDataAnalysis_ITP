		<title>08The Quarry</title>
		<content>   Most of the area covered by the     
 Quarry comes into another block, but a
 small part comes into our area.  The  
 work there started in l945 and now    
 112,000 tons of stone are quarried    
 every year.                           
                                       
   The rock face is blasted every 10   
 days and ll men are employed to crush,
 load and transport the stone away.    
 About half of the men live locally.   
 The machinery used is a crusher,      
 tractors, dumper trucks and cranes.   
                                       
   The limestone quarried, which       
 is full of fossils, is used for stone 
 walls and buildings in its natural    
 state, or ground up and mixed with    
 cement to make Bradstone blocks for   
 building.  The remaining dust is sold 
 to farmers for use as a fertiliser.
