		<content>      The Parish Church of St. George's
 has a number of interesting and       
 unusual attractions.   Once upon a    
 time there was even a yew tree growing
 out of the top of the Church Tower.   
      All round the outside walls of   
 the Church there is an amazing        
 collection of carvings.    They show  
 both angels and lots of vey           
 frightening looking animals.   Even   
 inside there is a cariving of a man   
 trying hard to escape from a large    
 snake like creature.                  
      There are lots of lovely         
 carvings on the end of many of the    
 benches in Bicknoller Church.   One   
 really good carving shows St. George -
 this is because the Church is         
 dedicated to St. George.              
      Outside in the Churchyard there  
 are some old stocks which looked      
 really interesting.                   </content>
