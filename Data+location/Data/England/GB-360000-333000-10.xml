		<content> At Hoarstone there is a farm of 179   
 acres which is about 300 years        
 old.Extensions were made in 1800.Two  
 people own the land and they each farm
 the area which belongs to them.One of 
 them has 139 acres and the other has  
 40 acres.Both grow barley and         
 grass.The amount of fertilizer for the
 grassland is 3 hundredweight per acre 
 per year.The barley is sprayed with a 
 chemical formula.                     
   There are about 290 sheep and 3     
 horses.One of the farmers has some    
 grazing cattle.                       
   Even though two people farm the land
 only one family lives in the          
 house.There are four people in the    
 family.When they moved in in 1951     
 there were 10 acres of woodland but   
 these were cleared in 1960.There is a 
 pool of 3 acres quite a distance from 
 the house.                            </content>
