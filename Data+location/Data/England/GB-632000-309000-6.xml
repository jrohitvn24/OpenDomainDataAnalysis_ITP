		<title>06HOUSING IN BLOFIELD</title>
		<content>    The majority of houses in Blofield 
 are new like the ones in the          
 Danesbower Lane area, which are mostly
 detatched houses.  These have very    
 little gardens but the houses are     
 quite large with on average nine      
 rooms.                                
   Some of the houses in Blofield are  
 semi_detached built in the 1940s again
 with small gardens.  There are also a 
 few in Skedge Way for example.        
   But there are a few houses which    
 were built  in the 19th Century,      
 Turret House is one of these built in 
 1832.  These houses have very large   
 grounds like Blofield House has.      
   All the houses mainly surround the  
 shops in Blofield.  The other houses  
 seem to branch off from these and are 
 surrounded by arable fields and fruit 
 farms, but some farm houses are quite 
 isolated.                             </content>
