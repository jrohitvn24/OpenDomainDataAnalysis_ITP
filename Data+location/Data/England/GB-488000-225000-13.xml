		<content> The majority of the Soulbury area     
 consists of farmland evenly           
 distributed between grazing and crop  
 cultivation. The area towards         
 Heath and Reach becomes sandy and is  
 used by nearby brick manufacturing    
 works. This area contains a large     
 country park named Stockgrove Park    
 with a lake and many lovely walks.    
 There are a large variety of wild     
 mammals in the area including badgers,
 foxes and Muntjac deer (dog deer). The
 Whaddon Chase hunt operate regularly  
 in the area. Soulbury has inaugerated 
 an Environment group responsible for  
 preserving existing flora and fauna   
 and to supply new trees, shrubs and   
 bulbs.They aim to restore and return  
 the village to its original           
 environment. The landscape has been   
 devastated by the loss of the elm     
 trees due to Dutch elm disease.       </content>
