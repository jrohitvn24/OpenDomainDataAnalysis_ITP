  There is no public transport serving 
 Gratton parish but there is a very    
 limited bus service provided by Silver
 Service to Elton and Birchover. The   
 latter is two-hourly from and to      
 Matlock and Bakewell with the last bus
 leaving both towns at about 5.15 p.m. 
 There is no Sunday service but an     
 extra mid-evening bus runs to Matlock 
 on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays  
 and returns from Matlock at 10.30 p.m.
  Almost every working family owns at  
 least one vehicle with some owning    
 two or more. Households without       
 transport are mainly occupied by old  
 age pensioners.                       
  The nearest railway station is at    
 Matlock with twelve trains a day      
 running to and from Derby.
