		<content> Some people will go to the cinema for 
 entertainment, other people would go  
 to clubs and discos.  People have     
 diffrent ways to be entitained like   
 just sitting at home listening to the 
 radio or watching television, or going
 to the theatre.  Some people even read
 books to entitain themselves. I       
 entitain myself by reading books or   
 make model aircraft kits or doing     
 jigsaw puzzles.  Most teenagers might 
 go the arcaids.  They mite even go and
 watch a pop group or a local band in  
 the aera.  Some people mite fansy     
 going to watch a football or rugby    
 match near by. Maybe they would like  
 to a sports centere to play a sport   
 for some sort of enterainment.
