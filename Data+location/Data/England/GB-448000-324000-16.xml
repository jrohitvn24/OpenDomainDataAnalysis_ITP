		<content> The{Post Office}is in the S. part of  
 the village,{Mr Beers}is the{Post -   
{master.}It gives a number of services 
 including{stamps, postal orders,      
{National Savings, banking, Premium    
{Bonds, DHSS work, family allowances,  
{unemployment benefits, dog and TV     
{licences.}The{mail}arrives at 06.40   
 for sorting. 1000-1500{letters}and    
{parcels}are sent out daily. Decisions 
 at{Head Office}are worrying{Mr Beers  
 about his{office}closing down. Old    
 people would suffer most because they 
 would have to get their{pensions}in   
{Loughborough.}It is a social event    
 for them. Sometimes{Post Offices}run  
 out of money, most of it is supplied  
 from{Leicester}and some is obtained   
 over the counter. Thousands of pounds 
 are handled each week. Small{offices  
 are always at risk of robbery as      
 larger{offices}are better protected.  </content>
