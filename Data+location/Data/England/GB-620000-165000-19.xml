		<content>{Orall tradition:}In the 1920s one     
 stock man at Marshside walked his bull
 on a lead like a dog to give it       
 exercise, a custom not much less      
 amazing is that of a modern resident  
 of Maypole who takes a small elephant 
 for walks. The {Home Guard}in World   
 War 2 guarded a local Water Works and 
 later in the war the big RAF Ammuniton
 Dump at Trenly Park.  In the Second   
 World War soldiers used to practice   
 around the village of Marshside. The {
{Battle of Britian}was fought over the 
 area and the villagers watched the    
 "con trails" of fighters and bomber   
 cross  and recross. Later Doodle Bugs 
 flew overhead and a{bomber}crashed at 
 Chislet. Also a butcher was killed by 
 an emeny plane firing at the village. 
 There were four local men who went to 
 the war and never came back.
