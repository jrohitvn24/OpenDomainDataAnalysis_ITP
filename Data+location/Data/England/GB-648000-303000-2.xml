		<title>02FARMING IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   We visited  Eastles farm in{Bradwell
 to find out how it was run. The 100   
 hectare farm is situated on land that 
 gently slopes down towards Breydon    
 Water. The farm manager has a further 
 140 hectares of land in{Oulton Broad, 
 about eight miles away.               
   This farm is mainly arable and as   
 most of the work is done by machines  
 only a few men are employed. Three men
 are employed throughout the year and  
 two extra men work there during the   
 winter.                               
   The farmhands usually work five days
 a week unless they are very busy, for 
 example, at harvest time. They work   
 about forty five hours a week,        
 starting at 7.30 a.m.                 
   The people we spoke to at the farm  
 all said they enjoyed their work.
