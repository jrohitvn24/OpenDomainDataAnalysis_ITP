		<title>15Cultural Groups in Uxbridge</title>
		<content> There are many different religions in 
 Uxbridge.In our Infant School,        
 (Whitehall)we have Christian,Muslim,  
 Sikh,Hindu and Jehovahs Witness.There 
 is a Mosque but Sikh and Hindu have to
 go to Southall to their Temple,but    
 sometimes they keep a room in their   
 house for worship.Below are some      
 comments from some of our seven year  
 old children.                         
   ,,                                  
     I go to Sunday School...I have    
  story about Jesus and I do a         
 picture,,.                            
  ,,                                   
    At Eid we get alot of money and I  
 wear beautiful clothes.We go to the   
 Mosque.Everybody gives money as       
 Charity and women wear Mendhi on their
 hands and men wear perfume,,.
