		<title>15LEISURE ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content> We interviewed people using a         
 questionnaire asking what their       
 favourite pastime was.  Reading is the
 most popular activity.  No one that we
 interviewed like horse riding.  Most  
 people seemed to like pastimes they   
 could do around the house.  We think  
 this is because they don't need to pay
 a lot of money to do them.  Swimming  
 is popular in Alnwick because there is
 a pool in the town.  We asked what    
 other activities people liked doing   
 which weren't on the list.  Other     
 pastimes inculded macrame, watching   
 tropical fish, wine and beer making   
 and roller skating.  Suggestions to   
 improve the leisure facilities        
 inculded adding a cinema, park,       
 museum, putting green and a really    
 good sports centre.
