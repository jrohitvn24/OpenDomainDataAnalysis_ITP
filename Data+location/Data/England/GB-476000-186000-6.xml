		<title>06The Pheasant Shoot.</title>
		<content>It is usually at the end of October    
when most of the leaves are off the    
trees that the first shoot takes place.
Lord Hambleden invites seven guns and  
the gamekeeper employs 30 beaters.The  
beaters spread out and make a lot of   
noise to bring the birds along.The guns
are ready waiting in a valley having   
drawn lots for order of shooting.On a  
good day 250-600 birds are shot.The    
game cart comes along and the pickers- 
up with trained dogs,put the birds in  
heaps.They are tied in a brace and sold
to the game dealer in the village who  
in turn,sells to hotels.               
  The shoot can expect to bag 6000     
birds in one season.It costs 2000      
pounds per day and visitors come from  
Holland as do many farmers from        
Norfolk.
