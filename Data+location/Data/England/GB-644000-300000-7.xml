		<content>   Most of the marshland West of       
 Gt.Yarmouth is let on an annual basis.
 Yearly auctions are held at various   
 public houses.'The Bell' at Haddiscoe 
 is the setting for one such auction   
 where the triangular area of marshland
 bounded by the rivers Yare, Waveney   
 and the connecting New Cut, known as  
 the 'Island' are let to the highest   
 bidder.It is said that until quite    
 recently people were born, lived and  
 died on the 'island' without ever     
 leaving its confines.                 
     Recent interest in country crafts 
 has given a boost to reed cutting.This
 arduous task is now highly lucrative, 
 but provides very few days employment.
 There are now few willing to endure   
 the life of the old 'marshmen' whose  
 year-long labours included ditching   
 stock management, water level and reed
 management.                           </content>
