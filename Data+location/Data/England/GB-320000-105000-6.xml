    If you want a pig to farrow you put
 it with a boar for about a week then  
 take the sow away.Put the sow in a    
 shed on her own for about two-three   
 months. She will start making her bed.
 That means she is ready to have her   
 piglets.When she has finally finished 
 her bed she will have up to twenty    
 piglets.                              
                                       
{       Poultry}                       
 Some farms in the area also keep      
 poultry.Quite a lot have a few        
 chickens in the yard and it is often  
 the children's job to collect the     
 eggs.Other farms have ducks or geese  
 and one even breeds  pheasants.
