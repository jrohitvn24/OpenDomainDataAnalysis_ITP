<title>21Rowing boats on Raby Mere</title>
<content>

In the 1940's  and probably for many years before the war Raby Mere was part of a popular recreation area.  There were  rowing boats for hire and a cafe in the grounds of the cottage next door.  I remember going on the swing boats there and putting pennies in the slot machines before we emigrated in 1941.&#xd;
&#xd;
When my parents died in South Africa their ashes were brought back to the Wirral and scattered near the Mere.  It is now a private fishing lake and a peaceful place to feed the ducks and other water birds.   &lt;br />
