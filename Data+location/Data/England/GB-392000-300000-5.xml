There has been a lot of public debate  
in the Wednesfield area over the past  
few months concerning the proposed     
plans of Wolverhampton Education       
Authority.Changes in the birth rate    
over recent years have led to a change 
in the areas population structure.There
are now not enough secondary school age
pupils to keep all the Comprehensive   
schools in the Wednesfield Area open   
without incurring financial penalties  
from the present government.The        
authority intends to close Wards Bridge
High School and in future send pupils  
to other schools in the area. Many     
parents are unhappy about this         
reduction in choice in Secondary       
eduction and a campaign to keep the    
school open has been started.
