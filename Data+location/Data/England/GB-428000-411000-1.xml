		<content> Our Domesday area is part of rural    
 West Yorkshire.It includes part of    
 Woolley village on the east and West  
 Bretton village on the north-west.Much
 of the land is used for farming,and we
 visited Church Farm at the time of    
 sheep shearing.The only industrial    
 site is Woolley Colliery. The M1      
 motorway runs through the area from   
 north to south.Bretton Hall,once a    
 country mansion, is now a College of  
 Higher Education.In its grounds is the
 Yorkshire Sculpture Park and adjacent 
 is Bretton Country Park.We also       
 visited Woolley St.Peter,s church with
 its tower of five  bells, and Woolley 
 Edge Scout Camp.There are reports     
 about three people living in the area 
 today, and also a village gala and a  
 church patronal festival.
