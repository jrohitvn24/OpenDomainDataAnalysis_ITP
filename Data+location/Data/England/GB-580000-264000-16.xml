		<content>  Most of the houses in the area have  
been built since 1960. The majority are
council-built, but there is a mixture  
of private and municipal dwellings.    
  The former are varied, bungalows,    
chalets and two-storey styles all      
being represented.                     
  The latter are small two and three   
bedroomed houses, semi-detached or in  
short terraces. There is a great       
variety of style and several kinds of  
brick and cladding are used. Garages   
are in separate blocks and the small   
gardens are open-plan at the front.    
There are several squares and open     
spaces, which with the grass verges    
and  tree-lined roads create a very    
pleasant environment, and it is not    
surprising that some houses have       
been bought by tenants.                
  Along the main roads are a few large 
older houses in big gardens.           </content>
