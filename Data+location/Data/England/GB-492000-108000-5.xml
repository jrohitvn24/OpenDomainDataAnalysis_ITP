 mares which are taken to another Stud 
 to be mated by a stallion then brought

 months time. The amount of land owned 
 by Mr.Read is 40 acres,some for the   
 mares and some which is leased out to 
 a local farmer.It has been a Stud Farm
 for 15 years.                         
 Their main animals are mares in foal  
 or which have just foaled,and resting 
 racehorses. The maximum amount of     
 animals they can take is 24 but at the
 moment there are 6 there and 4 of them
 are in foal. No famous racehorses have
 been kept there.                      
 The number of foals per year is about
