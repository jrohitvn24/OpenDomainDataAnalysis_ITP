		<title>14Banking in South Bradford.</title>
		<content> Our 'block' has a considerable amount 
 of light industry and a population of 
 approximately 40,000 and yet it is    
 only served by{ 4 banks.}In fact one  
 of these banks is situated on the     
 Euroway Estate and serves business    
 rather than the general public.Of the 
 other 3 one is situated in the extreme
 NW corner of the 'block' and the 2    
 others are situated in square 7.There 
 are{no building societies}in the whole
 'block'.Therefore it can be seen that 
 many people must not use a bank or    
 they use a{central bank}in Bradford   
 some distance away from where they    
 live.However most of the{supermarkets 
 are now able to{cash cheques}and there
 are several in the 'block'.Many       
 chilren still take advantage of the   
{school banking system.
