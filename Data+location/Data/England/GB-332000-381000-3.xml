		<content> 52% of the population is male. There  
 are also more young people than old,  
 with the largest age group being      
 16_20. There are few single parent    
 families living in the area and few   
 people who live on their own. Most    
 people who live alone are old_aged    
 pensioners or unmarried people. Most  
 residents are not native to the area  
 but moved for a variety of reasons    
 such as; employment, to care for aged 
 relatives, for the pleasant           
 environment, marriage and to move away
 from inner_city locations. Most people
 in Bromborough are not retired but the
 great majority of those who are       
 retired are old_aged pensioners.
