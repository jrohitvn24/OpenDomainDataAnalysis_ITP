		<content> We have many different sorts of       
 schools around Slough.In Slough there 
 are Lower schools from 5-8 years,     
 Middle schools 8-12 years and then a  
 test to go to a Grammar or Secondary  
 Modern school.There are also several  
 private schools.                      
  In Windsor they have Lower schools   
 5-9years,Middle 9-13 years and High   
 Schools after that.They don't have a  
 12+ exam.                             
  In Maidenhead they have Primary      
 schools from 5-11 years then          
 Comprehensive schools for everyone.   
  You can see it can be confusing for  
 people who move here.Some people      
 choose where to buy their houses  so  
 that they can have the sort of schools
 they like.
