		<content> TRADE-SHOPPING PATTERNS               
  There are very few shops in our      
 area,and these are :- a fish and chip 
 shop in Brewood,an art studio at      
 Gailey.There is also a post-office at 
 Stretton,which sells groceries as     
 well as stationery.                   
   Most people go to Brewood for their 
 daily shopping,but for the larger     
 household appliances they travel to   
 bigger cities like Wolverhampton and  
 Birmingham.                           
   Penkridge Market has a wide range of
 items including poultry and is mostly 
 used  by farmers in the area.But it   
 does not provide larger things e.g.   
   cookers,televions and furniture.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
