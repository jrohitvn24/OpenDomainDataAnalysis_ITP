		<title>16Darlington Cattle Market</title>
		<content>  {The cattle market}is on Clifton     
 Road where it has been since 1893.  On
 our visit the first thing we did was  
 to see the cattle being unloaded.     
 Then we talked to the animal health   
 inspector from the{RSPCA.} He was     
 there to see that the animals were    
 well looked after.                    
   Some vets came to test the young    
 calves to see if they would grow up   
 good and healthy or not.              
   The camera team from{"Look North",  
{the BBC TV news programme,}was filming
 the vets testing the calves.  I asked 
{Allan Powell,}the news-reporter,      
 whether he thought the cattle-market  
 should be moved to the outskirts of   
 town and he, like some of the farmers 
 we asked, thought it should stay where
 it is.  Others, like the{RSPCA man,}  
 would like it to be in the country.{
