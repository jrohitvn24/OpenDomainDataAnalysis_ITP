		<title>15THE HANGERS</title>
		<content> The Hangers add a particular character
 to the area,being visually interesting
 and rich biologically.They are broad- 
 leaved woodlands on steep slopes.Trees
 are mainly beech-some ash,oak,white-  
 beam &amp; yew.Owned privately until 1958,
 the woods were sold for timber.It was 
 so hard to get the timber out of the  
 badly neglected woodlands that little 
 felling or maintenance was done, so by
 1960,Hants CC were persuaded to buy   
 back the hangers (217 acres),which in 
 1979 were declared a Nature Reserve.  
 The East Hants Dist.Council recently  
 commissioned a report from consultants
 on the management of the area which is
 known to contain several orchids,foxes
 badgers,dragonflies &amp; other endangered
 species.  The survival of this lovely 
 area - often referred to as "Little   
 Switzerland" is thus assured,as is the
 future of its magnificent woodlands.  </content>
