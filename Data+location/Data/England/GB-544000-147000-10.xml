		<title>10Education in Four Elms</title>
		<content>The present school in Four Elms was    
built and opened in 1895 to replace the
old school run in a chapel. 54 children
now attend the school with the age     
range of 5-9 years. During the war an  
air raid shelter was built which is now
a store room. In 1963 the school       
kitchen was converted into a staff room
 nd toilets.Two years later a pool     
 as built with attached changing rooms.
The following year two more classrooms 
were added to the school &amp; in 1979 a   
brand new toilet block was built. The  
pupil/teacher ratio at the school is   
about 1-19. The school uses both the   
local church &amp; village halls for school
activities.The school has been running 
for 90 years and will go on for another
90, even if it is threatened with      
closure. The villagers see the school  
as an asset to the village and it would
be missed considerably....             </content>
