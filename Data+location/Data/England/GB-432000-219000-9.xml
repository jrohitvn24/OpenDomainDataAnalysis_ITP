		<content>  Charlbury School is separated into   
two buildings,the Infants at           
Crawborough and the Juniors by the     
Playing Close.There are 264 children,9 
teachers including the Headteacher,2   
helpers,5 dinner helpers,5 cooks,a     
caretaker,a secretary and a cleaner.   
  A new school is planned for 1987 on  
the Crawborough site which will house  
all the children.The school uniform is 
mainly grey and red but we don't have  
to wear it.In my class there are 35    
children.The school day starts at 8.55 
and ends at 3.15,we have 3 breaks in   
that time.Children come to this school 
from the nearby villages of Fawler,    
Spelsbury,Dean and Taston. We have a   
football team and a netball team.      
  We raise extra money by holding fetes
50/50 auctions,bingo and,occasionally, 
discos.
