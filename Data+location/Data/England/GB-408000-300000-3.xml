		<content>Many lanes and footpaths give access   
to woods, fields and small natural     
areas of great beauty. Many birds,     
butterflies, small animals such as     
rabbits and squirrels and wild flowers 
can be seen.Several woods are carpeted 
with bluebells in Spring.Unfortunately 
Dutch Elm Disease has destroyed the Elm
trees but many other varieties of tree,
mainly deciduous, provide areas of     
attractive woodlands.A tree            
preservation order has been placed on  
Clay Pit Rough after the removal of    
woodland to increase arable land.      
At Hill Hook the old Mill Pool,all     
that remains of a large open area      
which is now a housing estate,is a     
Nature Conservation area; the pool has 
been restored,the old mill wheel will  
be replaced and seats are being        
provided so that people can enjoy the  
picturesque lake with its wild life.   </content>
