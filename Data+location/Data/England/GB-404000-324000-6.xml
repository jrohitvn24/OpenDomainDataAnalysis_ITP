		<title>06A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content> A farmer gets up at seven o'clock.    
 Then he does the milking. Then he     
 cleans out the milking parlour and all
 the milking things. At ten o'clock he 
 has his breakfast. After breakfast he 
 goes out and cuts the grass for       
 silage. At half past twelve he has his
 lunch then he goes and puts the grass 
 into rows ready to be put into bales. 
 A man comes with a machine to put the 
 silage into bales. After that has been
 done they have to move the bales. They
 put them into bags then it is teatime.
 At 6pm they do the milking then they  
 carry on with the bales until dusk. He
 then watches TV and then he goes to   
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
