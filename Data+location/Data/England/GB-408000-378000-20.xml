		<content>  This survey was carried out by the   
 children of Peak Forest School as a   
 local studies project.                
  In doing the project the children    
 have visited farms ,quarries and homes
 and help has been given by parents,   
 friends and the Peak National Park    
 Education service.                    
  The project culminated in a display  
 of work which had both written and    
 three dimensional presentations as    
 well as video, tape-slide and oral    
 contributions. The project has        
 involved the children in all aspects  
 of the school curriculum and has been 
 a rewarding experience.
