		<title>06BARTON HALL AND COTTAGES</title>
		<content>    To the east of Cagefield Road is a 
 large building called{Barton Hall.}   
 This is no longer used as a private   
 dwelling.Its main use now is to store 
 farm equipment.At the back of the     
 Hall is{Barton Cottages.}The Hall and 
 unoccupied cottages are said to be    
 haunted.Caravans come in the summer   
 months and park near the Hall for a   
 few days at a time.The footpaths are  
 numerous in this area and there are   
 three decidious woods.                
  { Bartonhall Creek}runs south-east   
 into the{River Roach.}The land either 
 side of the river in this area is     
 uninhabited and relatively undisturbed
 and is therefore rich in the variety  
 of seabirds it attracts along its     
 marshy banks.                         
    Barges bring grain to the          
{Stambridge Flour Mill }once or twice a
 week.This grain comes from Canada.    </content>
