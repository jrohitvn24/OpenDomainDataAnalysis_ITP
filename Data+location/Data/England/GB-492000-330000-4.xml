		<content>   The B6403 or Ermine Street runs     
 parallel to the A1 before merging with
 it at Colsterworth.It was part of one 
 of the most important roads in Roman  
 times,linking London with Lincoln.At  
 that time Lincoln was a far more      
 important city and had a fort.        
   The main characteristics of a Roman 
 road can be seen in this block.It is  
 very straight although it undulates   
 and curves in a long arc.There are    
 several villages along this road which
 got their names from these times.     
 (eg.Ancaster,Which was a garrison     
 town).There are Roman remains near the
 road in our 'D' block(eg.A Roman      
 pavement at Great Ponton and a tumulus
 at Little Ponton).                    
   Today the road serves as a backway  
  to Lincoln off the A1.It is fairly   
 busy with many refrigerator lorries   
 travelling to Easton cold store.      </content>
