		<content> Old Dalby,or Dalby on the Wolds, is in
 a picturesque valley encircled by some
 of the highest hills which bound the  
 edge of the Vale of Belvoir. The      
 village is 7mls.N.W.of Melton Mowbray 
 and 10mls.N.E. of Loughborough.The is 
 in the E.Goscote Hundred and has about
 800 people living in it.              
 The village is surrounded by farmland 
 which is mainly either grassland used 
 for fattening cattle or grazing sheep,
 or arable land.The farmers employ very
 few people because they use machines  
 for most of the work on the farm.     
 The population is now made up of      
 commuters who mainly work in Leicester
 Nottingham or Loughborough;local      
 people who work closer to the village,
 in Melton or at the nearby            
 R.E.M.E.camp;and many old people who  
 used to work in small local firms     
 which no longer exist.                </content>
