		<title>02The Derwent Walk</title>
		<content> The Derwent Walk follows the track bed
 of the former Derwent Valley Railway  
 between Swalwell Station Site and     
 Blackhill, Consett. The line,which was
 opened in 1867 and closed in 1962,was 
 purchased and developed by Durham     
 County Council as a footpath,bridleway
 and cycle track in 1972. When the     
 railway closed the rails and some     
 bridges were removed. Some stretches  
 became impassable; others were used as
 local walks.                          
     The lower Derwent Valley is a well
 wooded,{highly attractive}area with   
 considerable wildlife interest. For   
 most of it's length the walk is       
 flanked by trees, shrubs and a variety
 of wild flowers.                      
      The Derwent Walk is used for     
 different activities. These           
 include: picnic areas and sponsored   
 walks.                                </content>
