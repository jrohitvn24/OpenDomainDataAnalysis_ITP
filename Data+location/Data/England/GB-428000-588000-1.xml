		<content> MY{HOUSE}IS QUITE A LARGE HOUSE IT    
 IS MADE OUT OF STONE AND HAS THREE    
 BEDROOMS.THERE ARE TWO BEDROOMS FACING
 THE SEA AND ONE FACING THE BACK LANE. 
 WHEN MY MAM WANTS HER{SHOPPING}IN SHE 
 SENDS ME DOWN TO THE CORNER SHOP TO   
 GET IT.THE SHOPS IN NEWBIGGIN ARE VERY
 NICE AND THE PEOPLE ARE VERY FRIENDLY.
 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SHOPS IN     
{NEWBIGGIN}TO LOOK AT AND TO BUY FROM. 
 MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED ARE IN
 NEWBIGGIN BUT I GET MY CLOTHES FROM   
 ASHINGTON MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE    
 HARDLY ANY CLOTHES SHOPS IN NEWBIGGIN.
     THE OLD SHIP, THE QUEEN VICTORIA  
 AND THE COBLE ARE SOME OF THE MANY    
 DIFFERENT{PUBS}IN NEWBIGGIN. I DO NOT 
 KNOW WHAT THE PUBS ARE LIKE INSIDE    
 BECAUSE I CAN NOT GO IN TO THEM AS I  
 AM NOT EIGHTEEN YET.
