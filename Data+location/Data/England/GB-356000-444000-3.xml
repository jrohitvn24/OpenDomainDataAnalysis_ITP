		<content> Most of the area is owned by Bleasdale
 Tower Estate and is used for shooting.
 The gamekeeper rears pheasants.       
 When boys are 13 years old they can go
 beating and can earn Â£9 a day.        
                                       
 There is a lot of wildlife around     
 Bleasdale.The largest mammals we have 
 seen are  deer.There are  many  grey  
 squirrels,rabbits,hares,stoats and    
 weasels.                              
                                       
 There are a great many different      
 species of birds but strangely there  
 are no sparrows.Sometimes             
 ornithologists come here to study and 
 take pictures of the birds.           
                                       
 In the springtime the woods are blue  
 with bluebells and many flowers can be
 found in meadows through the summer.
