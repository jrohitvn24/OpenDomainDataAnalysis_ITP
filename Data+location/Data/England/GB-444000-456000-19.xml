		<title>19THE A.59 MAIN ROAD</title>
		<content> The whole life of the village of Green
 Hammerton is dominated and cut in     
 two by the dangerous A59 trunk road.  
 Heavy lorries roar through the village
 shaking the old farmhouses close to   
 the road and making it impossible for 
 children to come to school or play    
 freely without supervision. Plans have
 been approved by the County Council to
 build a By-Pass to the West of the    
 village taking the Borobridge and A.l 
 traffic away from the village. In the 
 last week, however, we have heard that
 these plans have once again been      
 shelved for another two to three      
 years.There is to be a meeting of the 
 Planning Committee of the County      
 Council at Northallerton on 6th       
 December to which it is hoped a       
 protest against the delay will be     
 presented.                            
                                       </content>
