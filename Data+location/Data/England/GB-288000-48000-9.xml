		<content> The garden is 18 acres and is acid    
 soil.They grow plants from all over   
 the world because the soil is so      
 rich.The garden has 500 pine trees    
 planted around it to protect it from  
 salt in the air.These trees have      
 reached maturity and are now          
 dying.This is a problem for the       
 National Trust.Mr.Taylor told us all  
 the Latin names of the plants.By the  
 stream was a massive-leafed Gunnera   
 from Brazil,it looks like a giant     
 rhubarb leaf but is no relation to    
 it.There was a tree from South-East   
 China called Metasequoia,it is 35     
 years old,about 20m tall and is       
 thought to be a survivor of the       
 Dinosaur Age.A Wellingtonia tree is   
 useless,you can't burn or build with  
 it,its trunk and branches are spongey.
