  In the summer months,but particularly
 in June and July, many local groups   
 and organisations hold summer fetes to
 raise funds.Each fete has its own     
 style but some features are common to 
 most.There is usually some form of    
 special display,which could be        
 dancing,a parade, or a special        
 presentation by an organisation such  
 as the police or armed forces.There   
 are many different types of stalls and
 sideshows which offer small prizes .  
 Larger prizes are offered in          
 raffles,which are drawn at the end of 
 the fete.                             
  The Enfield Hospitals fete is one of 
 the largest in this area.In 1985 it   
 raised Â£5000 to provide minibuses for 
 hospitals.The Mayors and Mayoresses of
 Enfield and Broxbourne attend the     
 fete.                                 </content>
