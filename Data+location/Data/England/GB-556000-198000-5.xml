		<title>05THE VILLAGE HALLS</title>
		<content> The hall is a focus of village life.  
 The{Doddinghurst Village Hall}is      
 prefabricated and was bought second-  
 hand from Maldon. This year the roof  
 and porches were replaced.            
{St Margaret's Hall}is run by the      
 Catholic community. Both halls are    
 widely used by village organisations. 
 For young children, playgroup sessions
 and for older children there are      
 lessons in karate, judo, ballet and   
 tap; and in the summer a playscheme   
 which provides holiday activities.    
 Adults can attend keep-fit, yoga, and 
 dancing. The W.I and the Horticultural
 Society use the halls for meetings, as
 do "The Happy Old 'Uns". Troops of    
 Guides and Scouts have their own{Hut. 
{The Kelvedon Hatch Hall,}(1973) , is  
 licenced and is used for a similar    
 variety of community activities.
