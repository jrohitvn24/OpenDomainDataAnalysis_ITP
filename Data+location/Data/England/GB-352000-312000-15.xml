		<content> The village hall was opened at the    
 end of the 1920's.Mr Corbet opened the
 village hall in Upton Magna.The       
 Corbets were the first landed family  
 in Upton Magna,who owned most of the  
 land around the village.              
 The village hall roof is made out of  
 asbestos,it used to be thatched,but   
 one night in the early 1920's it burnt
 down,and so it has an asbestos roof   
 because it will not burn.
