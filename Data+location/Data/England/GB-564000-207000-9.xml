		<title>09ROXWELL KENNELS</title>
		<content>   If you are ever in Roxwell and you  
 need a place to keep your dog then i  
 would suggest the kennels as an ideal 
 place                                 
    the dogs have their own kennelsand 
 runs,sizes ranging from 5ft by 3ft for
 small dogs to 8ft by 8ft for big dogs.
 All kennels have covered sleeping     
 quarters and some have covered runs as
 well.                                 
    In the kennels there are normally  
 about 45 dogs boarding,6 breading and 
 7 puppies.When the dogs are one month 
 old they have one little meal a day,  
 at 2 months they have 2 little meals a
 day and so on up to 6 months. A very  
 old dog has 2 separate meals. All dogs
 need a licence but the vet has to     
 check over the dogs first before you  
 are allowed to pay for it. When the   
 dogs enter all are kept on a list.
