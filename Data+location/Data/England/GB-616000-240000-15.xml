		<content>The southern edge of Ipswich has no    
definite boundary when you visit the   
area.Ipswich may have a boundary on the
map,but any person who views the area  
from the Orwell Bridge will notice that
farmland is being swallowed up by a    
spreading town(i.e houses and roads).  
Farms have actually been overtaken by  
the towns growth and form an island of 
greenery in a sea of builings.         
 Most of the farming is given over to  
arable crops. The land ,soil and       
climate being ideally suited to the    
growing of cereals like wheat and      
barley and to sugar-beet.              
  How long before more land is taken up
by the town and its roads?
