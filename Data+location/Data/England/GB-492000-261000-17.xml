		<title>17The Queen's Visit</title>
		<content>   This year on 3rd May Her Majesty The
 Queen paid a private visit to her     
 lands in the Duchy of Lancaster.  She 
 drove through Podington and stopped   
 her car to accept some flowers from   
 Philip and Sarah.  We were all very   
 excited.  We made Union Jack flags. We
 hung some on a piece of string and    
 some we put on sticks and waved.  The 
 car had the Royal Standard on the     
 front.  It was a Rolls Royce.         
   The next day I wrote a thank you    
 letter to the Queen for accepting the 
 flowers.  I said how pretty her blue  
 suit looked and how Prince Philip     
 looked nice too.  I waited a week.    
 Then came an exciting day, an envelope
 with the royal crest on it.  The Queen
 had written to me.  The letter was    
 from a Lady-in-Waiting.  She said she 
 had been commanded to write to me by  
 the Queen.  I have framed the letter. </content>
