		<content>This house is large and includes a     
squash court, pool room and basement.  
                                       
    Another house which is unusual is  
shaped like a windmill.   This once    
was a real windmill but the roof       
collapsed so it stood empty for many   
years. This house featured on          
television last year as it was being   
altered.                               
                                       
     The head girl of the school lives 
in a three hundred year old cottage    
opposite the church which once was     
thatched but now has a corrugated roof.
                                       
     Another pupil at the school lives 
in a cottage at Westby belonging to the
largest farm in our area.
