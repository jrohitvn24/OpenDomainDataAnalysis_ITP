		<title>16SANDS FARM</title>
		<content> ONE OF THE LAST SMALL FARMS IN        
 EASTERTON TO TOTALLY SUPPORT A FAMILY,
 SANDS FARM WAS ORIGINALLY A MARKET    
 GARDEN LATER BECAME A DAIRY FARM AND  
 FINALLY A PIG AND BEEF REARING UNIT.  
 ELECTRICITY WAS BROUGHT TO THE FARM IN
 1954 AND MAINS WATER IN 1970.         
 PREVIOUSLY ALL WATER WAS DRAWN FROM A 
 125 FEET DEEP WELL. FARMING CEASED IN 
 1978 AND MOST OF THE LAND WAS SOLD    
 AWAY LEAVING ONLY A SMALL ACREAGE FOR 
 EXCERSING HORSES. DURING 1985 THE     
 FARMHOUSE HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND       
 ENLARGED, THEREBY MAKING IT INTO A    
 SMALL COUNTRY RESIDENCE AND HIGH BLANK
 WOODEN FENCES HAVE REPLACED MATURE    
 GARDEN HEDGES AND SHRUBS. DAIRY, COW  
 SHEDS, PIG HOUSES AND BARNS ARE       
 CURRENTLY BEING DEMOLISHED TO MAKE    
 ROOM FOR STABLING AND OTHER ANCILLARY 
 BUILDINGS FOR A PRIVATE RIDING EST.
