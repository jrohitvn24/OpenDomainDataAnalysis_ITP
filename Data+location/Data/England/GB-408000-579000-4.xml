		<content> This area was formerly well known as a
 stock feeding region but this changed 
 when farmers were required to produce 
 cereals during the 1939/45 period and 
 more latterly since the U.K. joined   
 the Common Market and now only about  
 50% of the land is used for grass     
 feeding of cattle and sheep. There has
 been a significant increase in the    
 area of covered cattle yards for      
 inside winter feeding of cattle, these
 are fed on silage, barley and barley  
 straw. There are no milk producing    
 farms in this block. Sheep are also   
 kept undercover in the winter until   
 after they have lambed and older lambs
 are brought in for fattening.         
 Average prices Sept 1985:_            
 Beef 93p per Kg live weight,          
 Lambs 157p per Kg est. dead weight.
