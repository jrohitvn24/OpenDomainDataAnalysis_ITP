		<title>03ATTITUDES TO LIFE IN WYTHALL</title>
		<content> Most people thought it is a good place
 to live, because it is near the       
 country and towns such as Redditch and
 B'ham.They also thought it was handy  
 for places of interest and entertain  
 ment. The farmers complained a bit    
 about the land being such heavy soil. 
 It is in the {Green Belt} and should  
 remain so.The 2 big towns could join  
 in the future but more land should be 
 kept for recreation like fishing and  
 parks.Already the building of the M42 
 has affected many of the farmers and  
 destroyed the landscape for many years
 to come.Many people felt that the     
 benefit of the M42 would be to remove 
 much of the heavy traffic from the    
 local roads.In general most people    
 liked Wythall as a place to live and  
 wouldn't want to see it changed.
