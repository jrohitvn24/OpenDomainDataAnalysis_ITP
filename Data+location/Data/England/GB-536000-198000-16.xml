		<title>16THE SCHOOL MEALS SERVICE</title>
		<content>{Subsidised meals}for the public began 
 during the{39/45  war}in{'British     
{Restaurants'}at one shilling cost.    
 From this developed the{Schools Meals 
{Service.}New schools built had        
 kitchens. Teachers supervised the     
 meals. This service filled a social   
 need in the lean times following the  
 war. It had been maintained by        
 successive governments. Costs have    
 risen and in the present financial    
 climate cuts have been made and prices
 increased to reduce the subsidy. In   
{November '85}the kitchens at{Holy     
{Cross Juniors,}employed three ladies  
 for a total of 57 hours per week. A   
 pupil paid{66p for a meal.}In one week
{675 meals}were{served.}Of these,{131  
 were{free}because of relative poverty.
 About{700 children}brought{their own  
{food}to eat at school.
