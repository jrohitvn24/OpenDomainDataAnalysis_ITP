		<title>07Bird Ringing (Brockhampton)</title>
		<content> As your walk begins in The Woodland   
 Walk,you will see bird{nesting boxes  
 on many of the trees.These are tended 
 by a local doctor.A few years ago Dr. 
 D.Boddington took me with him to show 
 me how he put the rings on the baby   
 birds so that he can see they return  
 another year.To do this he took all   
 the baby birds out of the nest boxes  
 and put them into a little pouch and  
 one by one he took the little birds   
 out and said "Show me a leg" and then 
 he put a ring on with a number and re-
 corded in his little book and put the 
 bird back into his little box.        
  In the wood ,you expect to see many  
 kinds of birds.The most common seem to
 be{wood pigeon,rooks}and{crows}in the 
 larger bird. {Wood peckers }are not   
 seen but once a {great spotted wood   
{pecker }came to our bird table for    
 food.                                 </content>
