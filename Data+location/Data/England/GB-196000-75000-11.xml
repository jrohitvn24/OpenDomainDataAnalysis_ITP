		<title>11The Maltster's Arms, Amble</title>
		<content>{Eighty}years ago the pub at Amble lost
 its licence. In{1964}the new owners of
 the house obtained a public house     
 licence again. The present owner has  
 had the business for{fifteen years.}  
{Holiday makers}are attracted to       
 the pub because of its low ceilings,  
 its very quaint appearance and its    
 reputation for{good food.}There are   
 three rooms served from the main bar. 
 Upstairs is a{restaurant}seating about
 20 people.{Bar snacks}are also served 
 in the bar but children under the age 
 of 14 must stay in the children's     
 room. As food is served dogs are not  
 allowed in. A free house, it has many{
{regulars}from the village and the     
 region. Some tourists come back to    
 Amble year after year and re_visit the
 pub. Opening time is from 11am to     
 2.30pm. It re_opens at 6pm and closes 
 at 11pm.                              </content>
