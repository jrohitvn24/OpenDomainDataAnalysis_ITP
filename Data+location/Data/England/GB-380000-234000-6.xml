		<title>06Roads in  the Longdon area</title>
		<content>   The{M50, }Britain's  first Motorway,
 was opened in 1964. It is a vital link
 to  South Wales.  It has recently been
 re-surfaced.                          
   It enters a cutting near Longdon and
 a service road -bridge was constructed
 to  re-join  two parts of a farm which
 it   bisected.  The {nearest  exit} is
{Junction 2}to{Ledbury.                
   Longdon lies on the{B4211 Gloucester
 to {Upton-on-Severn }road and the S.W.
 of  the  area  is crossed by the{A438 
{Tewkesbury}to{Ledbury}road.           
                                       
   There is a{bus service}to{Tewkesbury
 on  market  days,  i.e. Wednesdays and
 Saturdays. It links 7 villages leaving
 Longdon at 9.57 a.m.  allowing 2 and a
 half hours for shopping and  returning
 at 12.35.                             
   A {week-day  works  mini-bus}travels
 to Tewkesbury's Industrial Estate.    </content>
