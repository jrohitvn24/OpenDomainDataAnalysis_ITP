		<title>13THE BISHOP'S PARKLAND</title>
		<content>{Auckland Castle}is the residence of   
 the Bishops of Durham. The{Bishop's   
{Park}is a favourite beauty spot. The  
 parkland gave its name to the town    
 which was also known as Pollard's     
 Land.                                 
{St.Andrew's Parish Church,}on a hill  
 2km to the south, is an important     
 landmark in the village of South      
 Church. Bishop Bek ordered it to be   
 built in 1292. The tower is 25m tall. 
 There were older churches on the site 
 but nothing remains except a{Saxon    
{Cross.}It has been rebuilt inside the 
 church opposite the door.             
 Across the{River Gaunless}is another  
 old church building, the {East        
{Dearnery.}The north part was built    
 with the church for the priests to    
 live in. In the C17 it became a       
 farmhouse and later a private house.  
 It has just become disused.           </content>
