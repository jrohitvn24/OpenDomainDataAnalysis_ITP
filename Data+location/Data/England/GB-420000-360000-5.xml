		<content>  Birchover School is 101 years old.   
 It is the smallest school in          
 Derbyshire. There are only seven      
 pupils, six boys and one girl aged    
 from five to seven years, and one     
 teacher. There are just two rooms, a  
 classroom heated by a coal stove and a
 kitchen.                              
  The varied equipment includes a      
 cooker, woodwork tools, a computer,   
 percussion instruments, Lego and many 
 books.                                
  The Centenary was on 21st January    
 1984. There was a party for everyone  
 in Birchover and the pupils received a
 goblet with a picture of the School   
 engraved on it. The School bell was   
 re-hung and rung on the day.          
  Later in the year there was an exhib-
 ition of old documents and photographs
 illustrating the life of the school   
 and village from 1884-1984.           </content>
