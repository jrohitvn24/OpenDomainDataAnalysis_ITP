		<title>11My Paper Round</title>
		<content> Every week I deliver Forest Reviews   
 which is a free newspaper with lots of
 adverts in it. There are one hundred  
 and thirty two papers to deliver. I do
 one hundred on the Wednesday and the  
 thirty two on the Thursday.           
     I deliver to five streets Abbey   
 St, Pembroke St, Commercial           
 St, Victoria St and Prospect Road. I  
 some times have leaflets to deliver   
 and it takes a long time. Last time I 
 delivered leaflets I dropped them all 
 over the road. I get a penny for each 
 paper and for each leaflet usually my 
 friend helps me and I buy her some    
 sweets or something else.
