		<content>{Wivelsfield C.P.}has between 90 and   
 100 children from the ages of 4\ to   
 11, divided into four classes. Two of 
 the classes are in the original school
 building which is about 100 years old 
 and two are in 'mobile' classrooms.   
                                       
 The school has close ties with        
{Wivelsfield Parish Church}and is able 
 to use the nearby Church Hall for     
 school meals, P.E. and plays.         
                                       
 The{Parent-Teacher Association}exists 
 to forge closer links between parents 
 and staff and to raise funds for      
 'extras' not provided by the Education
 Authority.                            
                                       
 Before starting school, most children 
 attend the local playgroup. After they
 reach 11 they go on to Chailey        
 Comprehensive School 3 miles away.    </content>
