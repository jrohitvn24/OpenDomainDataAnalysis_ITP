		<title>03Economics of farming.</title>
		<content>The farmer we interviewed told us that 
there were eleven farms in the area    
thirty years ago. Now there are only   
three. Many small farms have           
disappeared or joined together.        
  He says it is harder to make money   
these days. One reason being the Quota 
for milk that has been agreed by the   
European Common Market. Each farmer is 
only allowed to produce so much milk   
and any extra can't be sold. Our farmer
before knowing about the quota had     
invested 27,000 pounds on new barns and
equipment so they could have more cows.
Now the new barns and equipment are    
no use.
