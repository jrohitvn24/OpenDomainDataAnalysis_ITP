		<content>  The children who go to the 26 year   
old Moulton School come from Moulton,  
Dalham and Kentford. There are 49      
pupils, 3 teachers, 1 cook and her     
assistant. The school uniform is a     
maroon top and grey bottoms. The school
hours are 9.00am to 12.00pm and 1.00pm 
to 3.15pm. There is an outdoor swimming
pool, climbing frame and tennis court. 
The building contains 3 classrooms and 
is one storey high.                    
There are 36 children in Gazeley       
School, which is similar to Moulton    
School. There are 3 teachers but only 2
classes. The school has been running   
since 1959, but there was an older     
school before this. The numbers of     
children are not now changing, but the 
headmaster, Mr. Baldry can't be sure if
the school will close down. All the    
children come from Gazeley and Higham.
