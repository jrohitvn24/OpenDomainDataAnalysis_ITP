		<content> 30 Rawreth residents were asked where 
 they lived before .5 have always lived
 here,11 came from Essex,9 from London,
 2 from Kent and 1 each from Cornwall, 
 Sussex and Bristol.11 have moved less 
 than 30 miles,12 between 30 and 50    
 miles and 2 over 100 miles.This shows 
 84% have moved into the area,only 16% 
 have always lived here.It also shows  
 that the further the distance,the     
 fewer people who have moved.Only 1    
 came from Cornwall,but 9 came from    
 London and 11 from Essex.Essex is an  
 area of rising population and these   
 figures show from where some have     
 come.Many people have moved east,away 
 from London.Those who have moved a    
 long distance reflect the trend for   
 people to move into the south east of 
 England.
