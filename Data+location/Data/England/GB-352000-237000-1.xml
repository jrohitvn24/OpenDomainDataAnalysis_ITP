		<title>01The Area We Surveyed.</title>
		<content>  The area we surveyed included the    
 eastern side of{Hereford}around{Eign  
{Hill.}This is mainly the residential  
 area known as{Tupsley.                
                                       
  To the south of this is the{Rotherwas
 area with its{ancient monument}and    
 more recent{industrial estate.        
                                       
  In the eastern parts of our area is  
 the village of{Hampton Bishop},an old 
 village which has had a constant      
 battle against flooding.              
                                       
    The{River Lugg}and The{River Wye   
 flow through the area .               
                                       
   Much of the area is agricultural,   
 with some mixed farms and a           
 substantial amount of rough grazing.
