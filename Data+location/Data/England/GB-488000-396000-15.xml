		<title>15Scotton/Northorpe: Law/Order</title>
		<content> Fortunately crime does not feature    
 large in this area, though there have 
 been a few house burglaries recently, 
 reports of a prowler and cases of     
 minor vandalism: disturbing enough to 
 a village but insignificant compared  
 with what is apparently commonplace in
 larger villages and in towns. Lincoln-
 shire police policy now favours "Commu
 -nity Policing" and local policemen   
 are encourage to get to know (and be  
 known by) the people in their area: in
 particular they are asked to attend   
 parish council meetings. Certainly P C
 Gerry Thorold, based at Scotter, is   
 better known than his predecessors and
 is working hard to establish a rela-  
 tionship where people tell him of any-
 thing untoward and feel able to call  
 on him for help where appropriate. In 
 October 1985 he spoke to an open W.I. 
 meeting in Scotton on Solvent Abuse.  </content>
