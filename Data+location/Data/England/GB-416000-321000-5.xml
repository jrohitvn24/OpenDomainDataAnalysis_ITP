 get up at 7 o'clock, get washed and   
 dressed and have my breakfast. Then I 
 clean my teeth and get all my things  
 ready for school. At 8.30 a.m we leave

 school we sometimes get a short       
 playtime, and the game we play at the 
 moment is{marbles.}At 9 o'clock we    
 come in for{register and assembly.}   
 After that we have the usual work,

 a.m. we have a break for 15 minutes - 
 marbles again! Then another session of
 lessons until midday.
