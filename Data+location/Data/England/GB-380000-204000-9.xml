		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY DAD</title>
		<content> First thing in the morning my dad     
 wakes up at 6.00 a.m. and makes a cup 
 of tea.  He has no breakfast.  At 7.00
 a.m. he gets his lunch bag and puts it
 in his van and drives to work.  He has
 two breaks, one at 10.00 a.m. when he 
 has just a drink of coffee and another
 at 1.30 p.m. when he eats a packed    
 lunch.  He has sandwiches and a packet
 of crisps.  My dad is a bricklayer and
 helps to build houses and shops.  The 
 firm is called Barnwood Builders and  
 at the moment they are building a big 
 Police Station just outside           
 Gloucester.  He finishes work at 5.30 
 p.m. and gets home half an hour later.
 When he gets home he has his tea, sits
 on the settee and reads the newspaper.
 Sometimes he watches television or    
 goes to the public house.  He likes to
 watch films and sport.
