		<content>{Withington Post Office}is situated on 
 a lane near Norman's cash and carry.  
 The Post Office has been there since  
 1976 but the shop since 1915. Mr.     
 Thursfield has owned the shop for 3   
 years and employs 4 paperboys and ,on 
 Sundays, an assistant. The shop is    
 full of magazines, sweets and 'papers 
 ranging from "The Daily Telegraph" to 
 "The Withington news."                
  The shop is open from 7.30 until 5.30
 ,closing for lunch from 1.30 until    
 2.30. Thursday is the busiest day, as 
 "The Hereford Times" is out, and      
 pensions are collected. Newspapers are
 delivered within a 2 mile radius of   
 the Post Office. The owner, who lives 
 above the shop with his wife and 2    
 sons, says that he prefers working in 
 a rural area such as this.
