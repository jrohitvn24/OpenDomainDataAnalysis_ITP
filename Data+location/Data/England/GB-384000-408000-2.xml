		<title>02Crimble Mill.</title>
		<content> The mill is used for{dyeing}and       
 finishing material. It has been used  
 for{textile work}since the late       
 1860's, when it was built. The bricks 
 were made by hand. Under the mill was 
 once a{coal}mine, now for heating they
 burn{oil.}                            
   The cloth is stored in the mill     
 store room. In The Grey Room workers  
 take cloth off the bales and number   
 it. The{singeing}machine   burns the  
 rough parts of the material and the   
 fine bits off the back.               
   A machine is used to bleach the     
 cloth which is passed through 8 times 
{Bleaching}was once done by laying the 
 cloth in buttermilk and leaving it for
 6 months.It is dried in a steam       
 chamber.                              
   In the dyeing room are machines for 
 dyeing the material. The mill makes   
 the back of the Oxford Dictionary.    </content>
