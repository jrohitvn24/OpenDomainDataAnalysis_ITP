		<content> About 500 people live in the parish of
 Ashford and Sheldon. The village has  
 changed over the last few years with  
 the building of council houses.  The  
 first lot were built in 19  , and the 
 second in 19  .  This has allowed a   
 moving population, but movement is    
 fairly slow. There are a lot of well  
 established families but the number of
 'newcomers' is growing.  It is a      
 fairly close knit  community.         
 At Wells Dressing time many women work
 in groups to do the wells.  Most have 
 helped at some time during their      
 lives.  The village is tending to     
 become a village of older people, and 
 there are fewer and fewer in school as
 the years pass.  The number dropped   
 from 80 in 1978 to 20 in 1985.  The   
 village is very beautiful and has won 
 'Best Kept Village'award several      
 times.                                </content>
