		<title>20Roads,Greenlanes &amp; Services</title>
		<content> The Garton block contains many paths, 
 lanes and roads.Some of these are pre-
 historic trackways as well as a Roman 
 road.There are also a number of       
 pleasant greenlanes now only used by  
 farmers and walkers.They are 9 to 14  
 metres wide and may be ancient track- 
 ways,early estate boundaries or even  
 old drove roads.                      
 The Driffield to Malton railway line  
 opened in 1853 and a station was      
 opened near the village.The line was  
 closed for passengers in 1950 and for 
 goods in l958.                        
 During the inclosures of 1771 two new 
 roads were created.One of these became
 the A166 Driffield to York road       
 passing through the village.There are 
 two bus services-Driffield to Malton  
 and vice versa.There are 3,4 &amp; 5 buses
 a day except Monday and Thursday when 
 there is only one.                    </content>
