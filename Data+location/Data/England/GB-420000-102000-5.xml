 The New Forest District Council looks 
 after the whole  of the New Forest.   
 The Hampshire County Council looks    
 after the whole area of Hampshire.In  
 Burley the firemen take care of the   
 forest by putting out all the fires.  
 There is also the Forestry Commission 
 who look after the trees in the       
 forest.What they do is that they fell 
 all the trees which have some sort of 
 disease in them.They also go around   
 and if some trees are growing too     
 close together they cut down the      
 weaker trees and use them for timber. 
 They look after the car parks too and 
 make some new car parks if needed.If  
 they didn't put in car parks the      
 people might start driving over the   
 grass.They also make picnic areas and 
 put down the tables where people can  
 have picnics.                         </content>
