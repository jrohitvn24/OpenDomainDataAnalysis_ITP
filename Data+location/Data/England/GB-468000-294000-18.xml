		<title>18ECOLOGY  FOOTPATHS LOCAL</title>
		<content>   Children tried to find the footpaths
 that were shown on our Ordnance Survey
 maps. Several of them could not be    
 found. Some were signposted but then  
 soon disappeared with no further clues
 as to which way to go.                
   Farmers are allowed to plough across
 footpaths and then they vanish        
 underneath the crop. They are so      
 rarely walked because of their        
 difficulty that they are forgotten    
 about. One path followed a short way  
 was very muddy and a padlocked gate   
 with barbed wire then prevented       
 further progress.                     
   The only reasonable footpaths were  
 between Kibworth and Tur Langton, but 
 even these were not easy to follow.   
 The state of local footpaths is       
 unsatisfactory.
