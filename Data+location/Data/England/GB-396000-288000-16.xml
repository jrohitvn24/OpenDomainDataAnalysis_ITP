		<title>16GAMES AT JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Boys play football in winter and     
 cricket in summer. Girls play         
 netball and hockey. Other games are   
 'British Bulldog', where one person   
 has to stand in between two lines and 
 the other children have to try and    
 cross between the two lines without   
 being caught. Another game is 'Foxy', 
 where one person has to stand facing  
 a wall and other children have to try 
 and kill the fox without being caught.
 They are caught if the fox turns round
 and sees them move. 'Hide and Seek' is
 a popular game with as many players as
 required. One person covers his eyes  
 and counts up to a set number, while  
 the other people hide. He then has to 
 try and find the missing people. A    
 final game is 'Pig in the Middle',    
 where two people throw a ball to each 
 other and the person in the middle    
 has to try and stop it.               </content>
