		<title>11Memories of old Rawmarsh</title>
		<content>     Most houses in the Rawmarsh of the
 1920s were 'two up,two down' and in   
{Pottery Street}there were 4 outside   
 toilets for every 6 houses. Every few 
 weeks a man would empty them and also 
 the{'ash-mid'}- a container for ashes 
 from the fires.                       
    At about 2 a.m. a man would come   
 round the streets and wake the miners 
 by tapping on the windows with a pole.
 Later, another man would come and     
 light the gas lamps.                  
    The main streets were{High Street  
 and{Stocks Lane.}Trams ran between    
 them and then on to Kilnhurst Road    
 until 1933 when they were replaced by 
 'tracklesses' - buses running on      
 electricity.                          
    Behind 'Greenfields' there was a   
 pottery factory  and there was a fever
 hospital in Barbers Avenue. Fresh     
 water was available at{Caudle Well.   </content>
