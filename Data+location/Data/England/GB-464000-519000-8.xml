		<title>08SHOPPING &amp; TRADE IN SALTBURN</title>
		<content> In 1983 a new supermarket was opened  
 in Saltburn. By 1985 this had had a   
 marked effect on the way people       
 shopped. A survey showed us that the  
 majority of people in Saltburn used   
 the supermarket and felt it was       
 needed. In fact it was the first large
 supermarket to open in the town. Some 
 elderly people thought it had spoilt  
 the town's image even though it       
 offered a wide range of cheap goods.  
 Fresh foods were not popular and could
 be bought at local markets. The future
 of Saltburn's smaller shops remains   
 uncertain and several of them have    
 already closed. Many thought there was
 still a need for more specialized     
 shops although they understood the    
 problems that faced owners who could  
 not compete with supermarket prices   
 and the variety of specialist shops in
 nearby Redcar and Middlesbrough.      </content>
