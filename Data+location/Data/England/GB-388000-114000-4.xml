		<title>04VIEWS FROM STUBHAMPTON AREA</title>
		<content>    This part of Dorset is exceedingly 
 beautiful and full of contrasts, being
 the area where the escarpment bounding
 Cranborne Chase meets the edge of the 
 Blackmore Vale. The views are superb, 
 ranging across farmland to Hambledon  
 Hill, Bulbarrow and beyond.           
    From a vantage point on the hill it
 is possible to see across the downs to
 a large part of Hampshire, the Isle of
 Wight and the Needles. To the east,   
 natural woodlands and plantations     
 carry the eye down to Stubhampton     
 Bottom with its variety of trees and  
 cultivated  farmland.                 
    There are few signs of habitation, 
 except one or two farms and cottages, 
 and one historic house, West Lodge,   
 with fine views to the Solent, and    
 landscaped gardens and tree belts.
