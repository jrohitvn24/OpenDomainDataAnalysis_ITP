      Two of the restaurants had local 
 customers, the other one also had     
 customers that were passing by. In the
 fish and chip shop five people worked,
 two in the chinese take away, and     
 three in the Tandoori. All of the     
 people working there liked working in 
 Bovingdon. The people had been running
 the Tandoori Restaurant for only seven
 months. The people in the Chinese take
 away had been running it for          
 three years, and the Fish and Chip    
 shop for eight years.
