		<title>13LAND USE AROUND CHARING</title>
		<content>                                       
 In our 12 square kilometres, is the   
village of Charing, on the edge of the 
North Downs. The North Downs are       
mostly chalk and a few streams spring  
from them.                             
 There is a fairly large area of       
woodland and orchard around the        
village. The woodland is all           
deciduous, while the orchards are      
apple and pear.                        
  There are two villages in our area,  
the biggest being Charing,the smaller  
being Charing Heath.  In Charing Heath 
there are two sandpits. In fact most of
Charing Heath is built on sand, which  
affects  the farming as the land       
drains easily.                         
  A railway runs through Charing and   
just outside Charing Heath, as does the
A20 London\Dover road.
