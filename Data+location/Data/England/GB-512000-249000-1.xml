		<content> The village stands on mainly light,   
 loamy soil which is ideally suitable  
 for market gardening. This was given a
 great boost by the opening of the     
 railway in the 1860's which allowed   
 produce from the area to reach market 
 quickly. The railway has now closed   
 and most people travel to work in     
 nearby towns but the proximity of the 
 A1 main road means that the area still
 enjoys a favourable position for the  
 distribution of market gardening      
 produce. Unlike the position in a     
 number of parishes in the country,    
 there has not been a wholesale move to
 cereal growing and lettuces, brussel  
 sprouts, etc. are still important     
 crops.
