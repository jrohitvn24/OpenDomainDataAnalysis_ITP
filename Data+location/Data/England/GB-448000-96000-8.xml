		<title>08CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE - COWES</title>
		<content> Smuggling was well organized 150 years
 ago,but there is little evidence of it
 today.Drugs,drinks and cigarettes are 
 the usual things to be smuggled.The   
 main job of the{Customs(Preventive)   
{Officer}in Cowes is to prevent animals
 being imported.He can board,arrest,   
 search and rummage in all sorts of    
 places.He has his own boat,but his    
 work is mostly done in his office.    
 Boats returning from abroad must fly a
 yellow Q flag and contact H.M.Customs,
 Southampton.They usually come from    
 France,Germany or Ireland.There are 6 
 or 7 Customs Officers in the Summer   
 and 4 or 5 in the Winter.They deal    
 mainly with pleasure craft.Cargo boats
 enter Cowes in the ratio of 1 Cargo   
 boat to 60 pleasure craft.1300 yachts 
 were handled in the first five months 
 of 1985.
