		<content> Mr &amp; Mrs Hall grow 3 kinds of grapes. 
 They are Madeleine Angevine and       
 Madeleine Sylvaner and they have one  
 row of Chardonnay. Mrs Hall took us   
 through the wood along a primrose     
 walk. They think they have a badger in
 the wood. We saw some wild roses. We  
 saw pheasant as well. There are       
 beech,ash,bramble,nut trees and lots  
 of lovely wild flowers. Right at the  
 top of their property you can just see
 Blandford Camp. The pests in the      
 vineyards are moles which make big    
 mole hills &amp; snails which eat the vine
 leaves. Deer &amp; rabbits also eat and   
 spoil the growing vines. Wasps &amp; birds
 eat the grapes. On the by-pass and in 
 the newly disturbed earth there are   
 lots &amp; lots of red poppies. There are 
 even some purple poppies. Mr Hall is a
 pilot for British Airways flying a    
 Jumbo Jet 747 from Heathrow airport.  </content>
