		<content> The primary school takes children from
 5 years of age up to 11 years. At 11  
 years they transfer to King Edward the
 Sixth school in Retford.              
     In the primary school the mornings
 are mainly spent on language subjects,
 such as reading, creative writing,    
 spelling and grammar, storu and drama;
 also maths work which is based on a   
 published scheme. The afternoons are  
 spent on topic work which usually     
 includes science, geography, history  
 and environmental studies. Games and  
 sports are played and include         
 football, netball, hockey, fitness    
 training and general games skills.    
 Swimming is taught at the Retford     
 Sports Centre pool and all the        
 children attend swimming sessions on  
 Friday afternoons. A bus is provided  
 to take them to Retford.
