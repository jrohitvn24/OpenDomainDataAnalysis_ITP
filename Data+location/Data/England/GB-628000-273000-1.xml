 This block comprises most of the      
 parish of Cratfield with part of the  
 parishes of Laxfield, Fressingfield   
 and Linstead. A small village,        
 Cratfield lies roughly at the centre  
 with two hamlets, Silverleys Green in 
 the North West corner and Swan Green  
 about a kilometre further South. Under
 four hundred people live here. With so
 few people services are basic _ mains 
 water and electricity are available to
 all.Though still completely rural the 
 area is changing. Twenty years ago the
 population was mostly local people,   
 intricately related and declining in  
 numbers, then retired people began to 
 move in, but now it is younger people 
 with young families who come and the  
 population is growing. All children   
 travel by bus to school. Most people  
 work outside the area.                </content>
