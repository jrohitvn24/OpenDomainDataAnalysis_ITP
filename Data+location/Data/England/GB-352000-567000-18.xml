		<title>18OUR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is called Lees Hill Church 
 of England School.It is a controlled  
 school. Before the 1950's it was an   
 aided school.The main part of the     
 school was built in l876. It replaced 
 a school nearby called Crow's Gate(its
 remains are still evident about 200   
 metres to the south of the present    
 building.)In addition there was a     
 school at Kirkcambeck-near the        
 entrance to Gallowberry.Kirkcambeck   
 School was certainly there in l862 and
 possibly before that. Later it was    
 used as a church (some of our old     
 desks went there in 1876).The nearby  
 school house was built just prior to  
 the First World War.The present       
 building was built as a dual purpose  
 building:for school during school     
 hours;for evening meetings;and for    
 church at weekends. There is a chancel
 set apart for this.                   </content>
