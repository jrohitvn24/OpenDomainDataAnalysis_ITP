		<content>   There were three cinemas in{Darnall 
 -called the Balfour Cinema, the Lyric 
 and the Darnall Cinema. They have all 
 been pulled down.                     
   Transport in those days consisted of
{trams}and a few cars. Darnall was a   
 terminus for tram cars with tram lines
 on Staniforth Road and Darnall Main   
 Road.                                 
   The Shizan Restuarant now stands on 
 the spot where Mr, Smith's Cafe used  
 to be and a new purpose-built{library 
 has replaced the mobile library and   
 the private 'Red Circle' where you had
 to pay to borrow books.               
   In the past few years 12 out of the 
 20{schools}which were thriving in the 
 area during the 1950's have been      
 closed down, though some have been    
 converted into community centres,     
 store places and workshops.
