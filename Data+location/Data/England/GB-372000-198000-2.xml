 Our May Day Holiday.                  
 1. On Saturday I got my weekly comic, 
 the "Eagle". After breakfast my family
 took me to Gloucester Swimming Baths  
 for my swimming lesson. Then we went  
 to the British Home Stores for lunch. 
 I bought some software for my         
 computer. Later I played on the       
 computer.                             
 2. On May Day my family and I went to 
 Great Mills Do-it-yourself store and  
 bought a lawn mower. Then we got some 
 chipboard and paste and a slate       
 mirror. My father needed them to      
 improve our bedroom and bathroom. Then
 I looked through some recipe books    
 until teatime. I made a salad with    
 tomatoes, cucumber, cheese, pickles   
 and cold pork. After that I had a game
 of Patience on my computer. Then I    
 washed the dishes and went to bed.    </content>
