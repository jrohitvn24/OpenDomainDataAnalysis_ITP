		<title>10A New By-Pass for Newport</title>
		<content> This{By-Pass}was opened on Tuesday    
 16th October 1984 in order to reduce  
 the pressure of{traffic}travelling    
 through Newport.It was built on the   
 Eastern side of the town from         
 South-East to North-West and measures 
 four miles in lengh.The opening was to
 be a time of celebration for local    
 school children but unfortunately     
 rainfall was so heavy that Newport    
 Junior School pupils and teachers had 
 to return to school without seeing    
 much of the opening.However an ox was 
 still roasted in the town square and  
 local people turned out in the evening
 to celebrate.In 1985 a{servey}of a    
 half-hour time period was carried out 
 by the Stafford rd roundabout.        
 Cars S.East 47 , Cars N.West 55
