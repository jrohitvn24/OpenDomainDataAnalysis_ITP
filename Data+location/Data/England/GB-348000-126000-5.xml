		<title>05The  Radio  Station</title>
		<content>   We went to the Radio Station. We    
 pressed a button and then a man looked
 out of a window. He talked to us out  
 of a box and then the gate opened on  
 its own. A man took us to a           
 maintenance room and then we went with
 John. He took us to the battery room. 
 They keep lots of batteries in case   
 anything breaks down. They have lots  
 of different sizes.                   
   Then we went to the 300 receiving   
 room and we heard a Frenchman on a    
 ship and heard a teleprinter which    
 sounded like some birds talking. We   
 heard an Englishman talking on the    
 phone, finding out someone's phone    
 number in Newfoundland.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
