		<title>13Bredwardine; Recreation.</title>
		<content> There are no public parks or          
 recreational grounds in the area,     
 although there is a small area of the 
 river bank adjacent to Bredwardine    
 Bridge which has been established by  
 tradition for people to sit and enjoy 
 the scenery. There is a footpath      
 between the bridge and the church and 
 from there to the site of the old     
 Castle. There are other footpaths from
 the village and Bredwardine Hill to   
 the Knapp.                            
 There is no public fishing on the     
 river. The fishing rights are held by 
 land-owners in the district and some  
 are let out to syndicates. It is      
 possible to obtain day-licences from  
 the Red Lion Inn and from Brobury     
 House. Fish found include salmon,     
 trout, pike, perch, eel and chubb.
