		<title>02MY DAD'S BUSINESS.</title>
		<content> I think more than anything else I     
 would like to take over my dad's      
 business. He owns a bus company. It is
 called{RED BUS SERVICES.}He has got 4 
 buses on the road. He owns 2 Albion   
 Nimbuses. One of them is scrap. The   
 other one is the only Albion Nimbus   
 still in service on Earth! It has got 
 31 seats. It is red and cream. He owns
 3 Bristol L.H. buses. He is in the    
 middle of restoring a very old Bedford
 bus. I pretend to drive his buses     
 sometimes. I also have a T-key. It is 
 a little instrument all bus drivers   
 have. You put it into a small lock    
 (only on buses) you then twist it to  
 open panels on the bus. I hope I will 
 own the service someday.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
