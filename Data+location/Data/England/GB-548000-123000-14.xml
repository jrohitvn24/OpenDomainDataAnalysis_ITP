 On the 3rd July there were 56 boys and
 56 girls in the school.               
 Class 1 (29 children) ages 9-11       
 Class 2 (27 children) ages 8-9        
 Class 3 (28 children) ages 6-8        
 Class 4 (28 children) ages 4-6        
 There were 4.6 teachers including the 
 headteacher. One secretary(12.5 hrs)  
 2 ancillary helpers (5 hrs a week).   
 Three canteen workers including the   
 cook.A teacher of French spends two   
 hours a week with the older age group.
 We also employ out of the 4.6 a       
 remedial teacher ffor one day a week. 
 The school takes part in the local    
 management scheme which means we hve a
 cheque book and pay our way out of an 
 allowance that covers books, heating, 
 some maintenance. Thus money we save  
 on telephone calls can be spent on    
 books.                                </content>
