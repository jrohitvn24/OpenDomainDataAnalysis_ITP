		<content> Before I came to St. Bedes I had not  
 seen Lawrence Weston. Now I come up   
{Long Cross}(the main road) every      
 morning, so I can see the{houses and  
{schools.}Compared to Clevedon, where  
 I live, the houses seem very close    
 together and they are mostly built by 
 the{Council.}There are also{flats,    
 some of them six or seven storeys     
 high. I also notice that there is a   
 lot of{litter}around the shopping area
 and many of the walls have writing on 
 them. Some people who live in Clevedon
 still think of Lawrence Weston as     
 quite a tough area. However it has got
 nearby{parks and woods}at Blaise      
 Castle and it has got lots of open    
{fields}for games.  Lawrence Weston    
 people are usually friendly and say   
 that there is less trouble today than 
 a few years ago.
