		<content>   Situated as it is in the foothills  
 of the Pennine Chain, the area is     
 subject to a relatively high rainfall,
 mainly brought by the prevailing      
 westerlies,sweeping in from the       
 Atlantic.There is often low cloud,    
 even in summer, causing fine drizzle  
 or dampness, when just three miles to 
 the west,Macclesfield, on the edge of 
 the Plain,is experiencing dry         
 conditions. In winter the upland is   
 often badly hit by heavy snowfalls,   
 frequently with severe drifting, which
 isolate the farmhouses for days at a  
 time. Conditions can be extremely     
 harsh even to the causing of loss of  
 human life.
