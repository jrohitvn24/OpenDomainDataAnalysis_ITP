 Fulbourn windmill stands on an        
 outlying spur of the Gog Magog        
 hills,overlooking the village and the 
 Fens.                                 
 It was built in 1808 for John Chaplin 
 by the firm of Thomas Hunt of Soham.An
 octagonal smock mill, it is 15 metres 
 high and made of oak with a brick     
 base.It has three pairs of millstones.
 It was struck by lightning in 1933;its
 fantail was blown off in 1936. Power  
 was provided by a tractor for a year, 
 but the mill finally closed in 1937.  
 The Fulbourn Windmill Society, a      
 voluntary body have been restoring the
 moving parts and maintaining the      
 building since 1974.The mill will not 
 work again because the cap is tilted  
 and would cost a prohibitive amount to
 rectify.                              </content>
