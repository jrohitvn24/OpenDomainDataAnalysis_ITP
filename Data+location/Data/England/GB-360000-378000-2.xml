		<title>02Playground games in Whitley</title>
		<content> The{playground }at Whitley school is  
 by the side of Village Lane. A member 
 of staff is always on duty keeping a  
 watchful eye over us all. One of the  
 most popular games is football which  
 is played by the boys most of the     
 time. At lunch time break there are 2 
 dinner ladies in the playground. They 
 help children who fall over. In the   
 winter we make igloos, skid patches,  
 snowmen,snowbears and other animals.  
 NO SNOWBALLS are allowed. Inside, we  
 play board games, noughts &amp; crosses,  
 donkey kong, read or play games on the
 computer. In the summer we play tick, 
 skipping &amp; climbing on the frame. The 
 girls often play horses or swing on   
 small bars.  Infants play families in 
 the old front porch. There is a garden
 with sandpit and climbing frame for   
 fine weather and a playing field where
 we can play cricket or anything else. </content>
