		<title>08The Gayton Nature Reserve</title>
		<content>                                       
The Gayton Nature Reserve was created  
by a local businessman in 1978 on the  
site of an old brick works and quarry  
just outside Gayton on the road to     
Milton Malsor (next to "The Limes").   
In seven years it has almost doubled   
in size. It now includes many acres of 
water and the 3 kilometre stretch of   
disused railway track between Gayton   
and Tiffield.                          
 The ponds and lakes were all dug by   
the owner to provide many different    
habitats which were soon naturally     
colonised by a variety of plants and   
animals. A few were introduced by the  
owner but he tried to keep the         
growth as natural as possible.         
 At the moment the nature reserve is   
not open to the public, but interested 
groups can make their own arrangements.
