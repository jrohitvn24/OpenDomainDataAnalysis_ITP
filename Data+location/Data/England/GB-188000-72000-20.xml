		<title>20HISTORIC HOUSE PART 2</title>
		<content> There are many reminders of the       
 houses first owner e.g. the stair     
 heads have got the Molesworth crest   
 carved on them and one of the many    
 stained glass windows has got         
 H.H.M engraved on it,standing for     
 Henry Hugh Molesworth.Another window  
 has got Saint Patrick kneeling in     
 prayer,holding a gold cup.            
 The nursery and chapel have now been  
 changed into a flat which is let.     
 The house alone covers a quarter of an
 acre and the gardens three quarters of
 an acre.The gardens have got stone    
 statues and garden benches.There is   
 the remains of a bridge that went     
 across the road to more gardens.      
 The old stables that use to house     
 horses now are used to store the      
 old furniture from the house.The      
 kennels where the gundogs were kept   
 are now garages.                      </content>
