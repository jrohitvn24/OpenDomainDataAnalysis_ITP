		<title>09BISHOP BURTON VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Bishop Burton has a small{Church of   
{England school}which has at the       
 present{18 children enrolled.} It is  
 run by its {2 teachers and 6          
{ancillary}staff.  There has been a    
  school in the village since the end  
 of the nineteenth century but         
 the Humberside Education Committee is 
 now seeking to close the institution  
 because of declining numbers.  It was 
 due to close in July 1985 but an      
 action group of parents was set up and
 travelled to Parliament to make their 
 protest heard.  This caused the       
 Government to grant the school a one  
 year reprieve and the situation is to 
 be reviewed in July 1986.             
 In the past the school has been       
 a focal point for the village but     
 today has declining importance. There 
 is no Secondary School in  Bishop     
 Burton, the nearest being in Beverley.</content>
