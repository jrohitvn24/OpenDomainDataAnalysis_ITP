		<title>17Walk in the High Street</title>
		<content> Approaching Thurleigh from the west,  
 the first good view is from Mill Hill,
 across the valley lies Bury Farm, the 
 church and Bury Hill beyond. At the   
 bottom of the hill, the road forks at 
 the brook. A right turn is up hill    
 into the High Street. On the left is  
 the Jackal public house and the       
 adjacent thatched cottages and        
 opposite the former Red Lion public   
 house, also thatched. There is a      
 footpath leading to the Church and    
 another to 17th century Bury          
 farmhouse. The street continues with  
 attractive cottages and the Victorian 
 school building and many trees and    
 hedgerows. At the top of the hill is a
 track to the earthworks at Bury Hill  
 and a view of the undulating          
 countryside. The old village core ends
 here.
