		<title>02BASILDON NE: HOUSING</title>
		<content> The houses here are built mainly in   
 terraces on an open plan system with  
 front gardens that open on to the     
 pavement, and grassed areas nearby for
 small children to play. Some of the   
 houses were built with just a pavement
 in front, or round a courtyard.       
                                       
 Early housing was reasonably well     
 spaced, but the newer housing gives   
 many people a sense of being shut in. 
 Few families had cars when the town   
 was first being developed, so most of 
 the roads are narrow and unsuitable   
 for today's busy traffic. With many   
 families now owning cars, landscaped  
 areas and front gardens are being     
 replaced by hard standing for cars.   
                                       
 Problems such as subsidence, vandalism
 and lack of finance for repairs are   
 taking their toll of the area.        </content>
