		<content> Though there are a few place-names    
 with Anglian elements the prevalence  
 of Norse elements suggests that the   
 major clearance and settlement of the 
 area was an Irish-Scandinavian        
 movement eastwards in the 9th to 11th 
 centuries. The main E-W road is called
 "The Street" which might relate to a  
 Roman presence, perhaps leading to the
 mineral rich areas on its southern    
 border. The first recorded mining     
 works date to the 16th century but    
 were at their height during the 19th  
 century. Old miners' cottages in      
 Fellside are now joined to form larger
 dwellings. Water power was used for   
 the bobbin mill in The Howk. Numerous 
 quarries provided building stone for  
 houses and barns. Derelict lime-kilns 
 once produced lime to fertilize the   
 fields. A house at Whelpo was once a  
 Quaker meeting house and burial ground</content>
