		<title>06  Radcot Lock.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Radcot Lock was built in 1892. Motor- 
boats and rowing boats regularly use   
the lock. A private road has to be     
used to gain access to the lock unless 
one walks along the river bank from    
Radcot Bridge.                         
 The weir alongside the lock is a fine 
example of a "paddles and rymers" type.
It is one of the oldest weirs on the   
Thames. The lock is one of the few     
still manually operated. Except for    
occasional closure for maintainance the
lock can be used at any time, usually  
the lock keeper is in attendance       
between 9.00a.m. and sunset. It is only
really busy during the months of June, 
July and August.                       
 Nearby is a steep, arched wooden foot-
bridge, known as Old Man's Bridge.
