		<title>19The Coming of the Mink</title>
		<content> An{unwelcome newcomer}to our area is  
 the{mink}.It was first{introduced}into
 this country{from the USA}in{1929},to 
 be kept in captivity,and to be bred   
 for its fur. Some{escaped,}or were    
 released on purpose,and{wild mink}were
 first seen in this area{5 or 6 years  
 ago. A relative of the{weasel,}the    
 mink is a{carnivore,}eating eggs,     
 young birds,rabbits,even kittens.Each 
 male likes a 1 mile territory, and    
 they{live in holes}along our river    
 banks.They can be{very destructive -  
 this year all the eggs were taken from
 our mallard's nest,just before they   
 were due to hatch-and they take more  
 than they need.Their{only enemy}in    
 this country is{man},they are         
 difficult to trap,and can rear{2 or 3 
 young each year. Their numbers are    
{increasing,}AND they are beginning to 
{upset the local balance of nature .   </content>
