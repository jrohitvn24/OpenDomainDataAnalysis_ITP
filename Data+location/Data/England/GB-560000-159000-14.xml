		<title>14SOCIAL.The Lunch Club.</title>
		<content>     In the village of Wrotham there is
 a club where old age pensioners can   
 chat and have lunch.The club meets    
 every Thursday.A vast majority of the 
 members have lived in Wrotham all     
 their lives and one had only spent one
 week away from the village in her     
 entire life.They would like to see a  
 chemist's and a shop which sells old  
 fashioned underwear also an           
 improvement in the bus service.What   
 they would really like is their  own  
  mini-bus.Since the by-pass has been  
 built there is much less traffic      
 passing through but in recent         
 years there has been an increase in   
 the number of motorbikes which some   
 people find to be rather a nuisance   
     Some of the members felt that too 
 many new houses have been built but   
 despite these minor grumbles most of  
 the old people enjoy living there.    </content>
