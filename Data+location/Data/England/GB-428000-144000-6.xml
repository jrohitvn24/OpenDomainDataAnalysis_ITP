		<title>06THE PILL HILL BROOK.</title>
		<content>   The Pill Hill Brook rises at        
 Thruxton, near Mullen's Pond, flows   
 beneath the A303, through East        
 Cholderton to Amport. This stretch    
 contains cress-beds, for which water  
 comes from deep bore holes and drains 
 into the brook. It passes Amport      
 Green, continues through Monxton and  
 joins the River Anton in Anna Valley. 
   Its banks abound with wildlife.     
 Several types of duck, Canada geese,  
 moorhens and coots are common, herons 
 nest in the trees and a family of     
 swans and cygnets have been seen.     
   The river runs mainly through open  
 land. In places willows, poplars,     
 hazel, hawthorn and alder line its    
 banks. Wild flowers abound: pearlwort,
 yellow flag, water forget-me-nots,    
 wild mint, rushes and campions.       
   This chalk stream contains trout as 
 well as minnows, bull-heads &amp; eels.   </content>
