		<title>05ACCIDENTS ON THE A435.</title>
		<content> The A435 Cheltenham to Cirencester    
 road is particularly dangerous. The   
 police have kindly provided us with   
 the following figures to emphasise    
 this. There have been 29 road traffic 
 accidents during the period between   
 April 1984 and April 1985. Only 2 of  
 them were fatal, 1 in Colesbourne and 
 1 in Perrott's Brook. In 4 of the     
 accidents there were serious injuries,
 8 produced slight injuries and in 15  
 there were no injuries. The traffic   
 census provided by the police for the 
 A435 shows that between 08.00 and     
 09.00 the road is very  busy. About   
 370 vehicles pass during the period.  
 This figure decreases until between   
 17.00 and 18.00 when it rises to about
 380. At weekends the road is much     
 quieter during these periods.
