		<title>05Farming - Overall Aspect</title>
		<content>  There are 34 farms in this area,all  
 owner-occupied except for one,which   
 is uninhabited,though the land is let 
 for summer eatage.                    
  The most predominant type of farms   
 are those which grow crops for winter 
 fodder and have dairy and beef cattle,
 sheep,pigs or poultry.Land not used   
 for grazing is sown with barley and   
 oats,or meadow grass which is cut for 
 silage or hay for winter feeding.     
  There are seven dairy farms which    
 stock mainly Friesians.Eight other    
 farms have Friesians and Charolais    
 cattle fattened for beef.             
  Sheep farming occurs on the poorer   
 grazing land.The average yield of two 
 lambs per ewe are fattened and sold   
 for meat.Sheep are the hardy breeds   
 which can withstand long,cold winters 
 when they are buried by snow-drifts.  
  There are also 2 large poultry farms.</content>
