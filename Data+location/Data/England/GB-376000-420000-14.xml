		<title>14MUSBURY VALLEY, HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> We have a valley in Helmshore, called 
 Musbury Valley. It is full of         
 beautiful countryside. There is a race
 called the Tor Mile, which involves   
 Musbury Valley. You run up a path     
 which leads to the Tor, then you go to
 the top and then come down again.     
                                       
 There is a lot of wild life, such as  
 rabbits, geese, fish and other        
 animals. Musbury also supplies the    
 water for Helmshore, because it holds 
 the local reservoir. It is very quiet 
 and peaceful, making it an attractive 
 place for picnics.                    
                                       
 There are nine farms along the Musbury
 Valley, but some of them are in ruins.
 The ruins form the main landmarks     
 along the valley.
