		<title>07FOOTPATHS IN CROWHURST</title>
		<content>   In May 1985 Class 7 of St. Stephen's
 School took the opportunity to walk   
 many of the footpaths and bridleways  
 to the villages of Tandridge and      
 Crowhurst. In the bracing wind we     
 found fields of corn,green vegetables 
 and rape. We walked through a{Bluebell
{Glade}which was thick with flower     
 heads. We used styles to cross the{   
{River Eden}and{Gibbs Brook.}Open      
 grazing land had evidence of cows and 
 rabbits.{Swallows,pheasants,plovers,} 
 and{lapwings}were also spotted.       
   We crossed the railway line to find{
{Crowhurst Church}and found the ancient
{Yew tree}supported by brackets to     
 support the weight of the branches.   
 Down the road we saw the old village  
 school. Its appearance had the        
 recognisable features of the school   
 but it had been transformed into a    
 neatly decorated private house.       </content>
