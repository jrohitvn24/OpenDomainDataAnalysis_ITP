		<title>16Holmfirth Primary School</title>
		<content> Holmfirth Primary School(locally known
 as Nabb) was built in 1914.At first it
 was an infant school.Later on it      
 became a secondary school before      
 becoming the present junior and infant
 school in 1964.At present we have 168 
 children in the school.In 1983-84     
 quite a few{modernisations}took       
 place.A new staff room and secretaries
 office was made and a two classroom   
 extension was added.We have six       
 full-time{teachers,}two part-time and 
 four peripatetic teachers who teach   
 cello,violin,guitar and recorder.We   
 are lucky to have a lot of{land}around
 the school.This includes two playing  
 fields and an area of woodland.A new  
 pond is being built at the bottom of  
 the large field and we have an        
 adventure playground on the small     
 field.From our school there is a      
 beautiful view down the Holme Valley. </content>
