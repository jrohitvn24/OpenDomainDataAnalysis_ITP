		<content> There is a Bishop Monkton {           
{Entertainments Group } of which       
 everyone living in the village is     
 deemed to be a member.  This group    
 produces a play every October, a      
 Summer show, and a Pantomime each     
 February.   These take place in the   
 Women's Institute Hall, and are seen  
 by audiences of at least 400.         
                                       
 In the pantomime every village child  
 wishing to perform is included in the 
 cast, as well as many adult           
 performers,  and the number involved  
 is usually about 50-60.               
                                       
 Occasional entertainments take place, 
 including fireworks displays and Carol
 singing around the village at         
 Christmas time.
