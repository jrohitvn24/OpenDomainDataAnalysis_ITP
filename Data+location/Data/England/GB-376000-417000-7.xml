		<title>07PAPER-MAKING IN STUBBINS</title>
		<content>  There are two forms of paper-making  
 taking place in our area.{Fort        
{Sterling }make tissue paper in        
 bulk and{Two Rivers Paper Company     
 produce good quality hand-made paper. 
{Fort Sterling}used to be called       
 Sterling Stubbins until an American   
 company took it over.They get waste   
 paper from all over Britain,and they  
 recycle it to make tissue  paper.The  
 paper is mashed and put into a mesh   
 sleeve so the water will drain off,and
 the resulting sheet is rolled and     
 turned into tissue paper.             
{ The Two Rivers Paper Company}produce 
 hand_made paper from wood pulp.Artists
 use it for watercolours and sketching.
 To give the paper extra strength it is
 dried then stretched,then wet again   
 and finally loft dried.It is very     
 expensive and is used by artists from 
 all over Britain.                     </content>
