		<content> They have to go round their stock in  
 the morning and again at night to make
 sure they are all o.k. In the summer  
 when the cattle and sheep are out on  
 the fields the farmers get to work on 
 cutting their{silage}and{hay}which is 
 stored inside for the Winter. In about
 September to November the farmers get 
 their{combines}out to cut all the{    
{Oats,Barley}nd other crops which they 
 had planted earlier in the year. The  
 seeds are either sprayed with Propcorn
 and stored or put into a shed with a  
 dryer going which will dry it. The{   
{straw}is{baled}and stored with the hay
 in a dutch barn or shed. In the Winter
 the cattle come inside for warmth and 
 are fed silage, hay and barley which  
 is bruised.                           
{THE FARMING YEAR IS A VERY BUSY YEAR.}
