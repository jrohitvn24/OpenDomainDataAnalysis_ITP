		<title>11DEEPING ST.JAMES-LIONS</title>
		<content>     This year's annual Deeping        
 Carnival was partly oranised by the   
 Lions.Their float had some characters 
 from Alice In Wonderland on it.The    
 Lions started in 1917.There are       
 branches of the Lions all over the    
 world.They were started by a man      
 called Melvin Jones.He started them   
 because he felt the community needed  
 some help.They are called the Lions   
 because the organisation is as strong 
 and powerful as a lion.               
     There is a branch of the Lions    
 here in Deeping St.James. They have   
 been going for 5 years.Not just anyone
 can join. You have to have a good     
 record and be male.The meetings are   
 held at the Deeping Stage.There are 9 
 positions in each branch of the Lions 
 club.                                 
     The meetings are held on the 2nd  
 and 4th Wednesday of each month.      </content>
