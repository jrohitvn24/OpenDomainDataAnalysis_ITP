		<content>   There are twelve farms in the area. 
 It is mainly mixed farming.There is   
 rough pasture,hay and grass for silage
 for the dairy cows.                   
   The arable farming is mainly        
 barley,wheat and oil seed rape.       
   There are some horticultural crops  
 such as potatoes.                     
   One farm,Summerfields,specialises   
 in nursery plants.                    
 . The barley is used to supply the    
 breweries at Burton on Trent.         
   The farmers have recently had to cut
 down on the size of their dairy       
 herds because of E.E.C. regulations.  
 This has caused a lot of anger and    
 even some financial hardship for those
 farmers who depend on selling the milk
 they produce.
