		<content>    All 4 farms keep cattle.Church Farm
with 200 mainly Jersey cows in their   
milking herd produces 500 gallons of   
milk per day.D-K's herd is maintained  
at 160 milking cows and 80 heifers.    
Downley's herd of 62 Hereford and      
Aberdeen-Angus are reared for beef (and
unusually pastured outside all winter) 
while Manor Farm's pedigree herd of    
Limousin cattle is being used in embryo
implant experiments.This involves      
transferring the Limousin embryos into 
the wombs of Jersey or Friesian stock, 
thus hoping to obtain pedigree Limousin
calves from non-pedigree mothers.This  
process is still in its infancy on this
farm and success in the 1985 programme 
is hoped to offset the disappointing   
results of the previous year.The       
temperature of the womb and            
environmental conditions are of the    
utmost importance.                     </content>
