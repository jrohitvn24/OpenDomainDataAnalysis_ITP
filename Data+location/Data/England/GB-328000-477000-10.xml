		<title>10Work in Ulverston</title>
		<content>  {Employment}is highly dependent on   
 local firms: 40% work in the manufact_
 uring site in S. Ulverston,25% in     
 Glaxo. Many residents work in Barrow. 
 Tourism is a source of jobs in pubs,  
 cafes,hotels,etc.                     
  {Unemployment}is about the national  
 average. The Job Centre has vacancies 
 which remain unfilled because of      
 unsuitable hours,pay,locations,but for
 one job as Process-worker at Glaxo    
 over 100 applied.                     
  {Furness and Cartmel Plan 1984}notes 
 a need to encourage local enterprise. 
 New sites for industrial development  
 by 1996 have been allocated. The Town 
 Council is keen to see that its voice 
 is heard by the County Council in     
 Carlisle and S. Lakeland District     
 Council in Kendal and that the        
 interests of local residents are safe-
 guarded.                              </content>
