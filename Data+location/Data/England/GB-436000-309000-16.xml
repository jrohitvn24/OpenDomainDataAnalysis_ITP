		<title>16Heather through the Years</title>
		<content> Most men walked or rode a bicycle, but
 in 1932 I was about the fifth person  
 to have a car.  My friend took me in a
 side-car of his motorbike to Coventry 
 to buy a Morris.  I had never been in 
 a car, but there was no driving-test  
 in those days, so I got in and had to 
 learn how to drive it on the way home.
 Up to 1932, Heather had a Mill and the
 corn was ground using power created by
 a dam in the river.  When I was at    
 school, we played football in Main    
 Street!  One day a boy was knocked    
 down by a horse and trap!  It would be
 unwise to play football there today,  
 as Main Street and all the other roads
 through Heather are so busy.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
