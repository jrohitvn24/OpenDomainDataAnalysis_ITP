The majority(311) of parents who travel
to work by train go to a station in    
London,with a further 35 parents using 
a station between London and Bromley.  
                                       
Children's main reasons for using the  
train is for day trips, with only 167  
taking the train when they go on       
holiday. The survey shows 146 children 
using the train to travel to school.   
                                       
Although now more people have cars, 95%
of the children questioned think that  
the railway is important for Bromley.
