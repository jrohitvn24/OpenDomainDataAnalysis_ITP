		<title>18A DAY IN MY LIFE-HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>   It is 7 a.m. and we are all         
 listening to the sound of Mike Read on
 Radio 1. It's soon 7.30a.m., time to  
 get up, dress myself and eat my       
 cornflakes. Mum walks in, "Look at    
 those dirty trousers!" she yells, so  
 it's all change. At last I'm ready and
 it's 5 to 9, Mum takes me to{school.} 
   Now the work begins - usually Maths.
 or writing. We are thankful when 10.45
 arrives beacause its playtime for 15  
 minutes. Back to work once again which
 brings us round to 12 o'clock and     
 lunch, something not to be missed.    
 Chips with everything! When the plates
 are cleared away and the tables are   
 cleaned we are allowed onto the play- 
 ground once again.                    
   All too soon 1.15p.m. arrives and   
 it's back to work. The afternoon      
 passes by quickly. Sometimes we do Art
 or play games.                        </content>
