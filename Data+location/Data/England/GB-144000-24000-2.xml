		<content>    Four years ago there was a great   
 disaster for some families in         
{Mousehole.}The{Penlee Lifeboat,}the   
 "Solomon Browne", was lost with all   
 hands. It was called out to rescue the
 crew of the S.S. "Union Star" which   
 had lost all power in{Mounts Bay }    
 during a very violent storm and was   
 being blown towards the cliffs. No one
 really knows what happened on the     
 night of 19th.Dec.1981 because there  
 were no survivors from either boat.   
    The new lifeboat the "Mabel Alice",
 donated by Mr. David Robinson, is     
 stationed in Newlyn Harbour because   
 it is an Arun class boat and will not 
 fit in the old lifeboat house.        
     In 1985 the Mayor of{Penzance }   
 opened a memorial garden, built by    
 the side of the old lifeboat house, in
 memory of the eight crewmen of the    
 "Solomon Browne".                     </content>
