		<title>17OUR TREE NURSERY &amp; PLANTING</title>
		<content>    We have a tree nursery in our      
 school in which for about three years 
 we have been planting lots of young   
 trees.  We have a wide variety,       
 including Elder, Beech, Oak, Crack    
 Willow, Ash, Hornbeam, Horse Chestnut,
 Wild Cherry, Rowan, Alder Buckthorn,  
 Alder, Goat Willow, Hawthorn,         
 Blackthorn, Wych Elm, Silver Birch,   
 Wayfaring, Hazel, Osier, Lime, Aspen, 
 Spindle, Dog Rose, and Bramble.       
    Altogether we have planted about   
 150 young trees in our field.  We are 
 now beginning to be able to collect   
 seed from trees we have planted       
 ourselves.                            
    The tree nursery itself is part of 
 the Devon Tree Bank project, which    
 aims to encourage the planting of     
 trees native to this county.  The     
 project's "tree lady", Mrs Turner,    
 comes in to help from time to time.   </content>
