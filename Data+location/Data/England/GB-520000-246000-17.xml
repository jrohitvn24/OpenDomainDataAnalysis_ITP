		<content>   THE JOHN O'GAUNT GOLF CLUB          
 The club was started 37 years ago.The 
 land used to belong to John           
 O'Gaunt,Duke of Lancaster and the site
 of the first house is called John     
 O'Gaunt's Hill.The present club house 
 was built in 1853.There are 1100      
 members of which 130 are              
 ladies.Members come from a 30-mile    
 radius of Sutton.Juniors can become   
 members if a parent is a member.There 
 are 18 holes on the course and it is  
 regarded as a top quality course.A new
 course has been made nearby called The
 Carthegena.It was necessary to have   
 another as golf has become a very     
 popular sport.There is a Pro-shop     
 where members can buy or hire         
 equipment.
