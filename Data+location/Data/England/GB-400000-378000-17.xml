		<content> On Christmas Day I get up early  to   
 open my presents.Christmas Day is a   
 special day when we celebrate Jesus   
 Christ's birthday.It's on the 25th of 
 December.I open all my presents and   
 play with them.We have a special      
 dinner,a chicken and a bottle of      
 wine.We go and have tea at our Aunty  
 and Uncle's.Tea is a bit like dinner  
 only 5 hours later.After tea we watch 
 television.Television is a square box 
 with a screen on which pictures and   
 films are shown.We celebrate by       
 drinking wine and beer.Wine is a drink
 which if you have too much it will    
 make you ill and beer is the same.Then
 we go home and go to bed.             
    A week later it is New Year's Eve  
 and Mum and Dad go out to celebrate.
