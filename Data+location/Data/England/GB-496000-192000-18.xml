		<title>18CHANGES IN CHALFONT ST GILES</title>
		<content>The village pond,fed by the River Mis- 
bourne,was once much larger, covering  
most of what is now the green and the  
road,then a narrow lane.Old pictures   
show an ancient elm standing near the  
junction of Bowstridge Lane and which, 
in spite of a petition from villagers, 
was felled to allow road widening.Also 
gone are the stocks,last occupied by a 
Mr.Lofty for stealing a chicken.The old
Pheasant still stands,much altered from
its original stone to a mock Tudor,at  
the point where the new main through   
road from Chalfont St Peter to Amersham
skirts the village.In days gone by the 
pub had bow windows so that refreshment
could be passed out to men holding     
their horses.Here is a recent change-a 
mini-roundabout system guiding the busy
modern traffic through the once peace- 
ful,narrow laned crossing of a century 
ago.                                   </content>
