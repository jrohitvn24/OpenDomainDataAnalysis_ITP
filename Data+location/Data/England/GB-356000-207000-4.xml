 THIS AREA BETWEEN THE RIVERS SEVERN   
 AND WYE IS ABOUT 180 METRES ABOVE SEA 
 LEVEL WHICH IS FORMED BY LIMESTONE AND
 SANDSTONE WHICH GIVE IRONORE AND COAL.
 THE IRONORE AND THE COAL MADE LOTS OF 
 JOBS FOR THE VILLAGERS.WHEN THEY FIRST
 STARTED MINING THE IRONORE THEY USED  
 THE OPEN CAST METHOD LIKE PUZZLE WOOD.
 LATER ON THEY USED THE TUNNELLING SUCH
 AS CLEARWELL CAVES.MUCH OF THE COAL,  
 IRON,STEEL,TIMBER AND STONE HAD TO BE 
 SHIPPED TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO THEY HAD
 TO BUILD A RAILWAY TRACK TO LYDNEY    
 DOCKS. BEFORE THE MINING STARTED ALL  
 THE LAND WAS THICK FOREST USED FOR    
 ROYAL HUNTING GROUND.NOW THAT THE     
 MINING HAS FINISHED IT HAS LEFT SLAG  
 HEAPS.THE WORK HAS GOT LIGHTER NOW    
 BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 5 WORKS LEFT   
 IN THIS AREA BUT THERE ARE MORE HOUSES
 NOW.                                  </content>
