		<title>01RURAL TYBERTON</title>
		<content> This area is used predominately for   
 agriculture apart fron a large belt of
 woodland covering the hill known as   
 Stockley Hill, which splits the area  
 into two parts. The area to the east  
 of Stockley Hill is intensively       
 farmed, there are two dairy farms in  
 the village of Tyberton itself, one   
 arable farm at Chustone and a small   
 nusied unit in the village of         
 Shenmore. To the west of Stockley Hill
 the land is put down to grass used for
 grazing. The woodland itself is       
 productive in that it supports the    
 rearing of pheasants for a shoot over 
 the area and the hard and soft woods  
 in it are grown and replaced          
 commercially.
