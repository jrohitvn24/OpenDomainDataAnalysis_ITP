 foundation with a large and full      
 churchyard.The church itself is       
 perpendicular in style and was very   
 much restored in the 1860's.The church

 maintained and there is one service on
 a Sunday and one mid_week.The non_    
 conformist chapel is now closed and   
 has been converted into a private

 need to go outside the village for a  
 place of worship.                     </content>
