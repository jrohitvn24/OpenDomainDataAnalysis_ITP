		<title>13CHANGING TIMES IN RIPON CONT</title>
		<content> 1925 CONT...                          
 Duffield's timber yard now occupies   
 this site.                            
 Where my school is now was once a     
 field called the Agricultural field,  
 this was used for fairs and shows.    
 In November there was a festival      
 called Martinmas,during which the     
 workers came down from the farms to   
 Studley and waited for the farmers to 
 hire them for the next year.          
  Women wore straight up and down      
 dresses and never went out without a  
 floppy-brimmed hat.Men wore Oxford    
 "bags"and"union"shirts and braces.    
 1945                                  
  When the men returned from the war   
 there were still many of Ripon's old  
 cottages left but many of these were  
 replaced by Council housing.There were
 ballrooms,cinemas and opera houses but
 in 20 years these had gone too.       </content>
