		<content>   Dairy farming is very important     
 here. We visited Mr.Arbery's farm at{ 
{Mutterton.}He keeps 41 Friesian cows  
 and 35 young stock.Day starts at      
 06.15,milking at 06.45.Cows are milked
 by machine in milking parlour.Milk is 
 kept at 4'c. until collected by       
 tanker.                               
   Finishing milking at 08.30,farmer   
 works around farm until evening       
 milking at 17.00.Busiest time of year 
 is mid May to mid June because of hay 
 and silage making.                    
   Good cow costs Â£600 and is fed on   
 grass,silage,hay and                  
 sugar_beet.Mr.Arbery has been given an
 annual quota of 25 288 because of the 
 new E.E.C.regulations.He is against   
 this as it cuts his profits.
