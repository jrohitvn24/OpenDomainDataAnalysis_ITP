<title>21Description of the Colne Valley in 2011</title>
<content>In the Colne Valley there have been some new housing developments in the Linthwaite area. Some three storey houses have been built on Banks Road where there used to be fields.  The Titanic Mill was derelict in 1986.  Now it has been converted into apartments, some to rent and some to buy.  There is also a gym, spa, restaurant and hairdressers in the mill.  The Huddersfield Narrow Canal has been cleared.  The Huddersfield Canal Society has helped in clearing both the canal and the towpaths. Cafes and bars have been opened near the canal in Slaithwaite making it 'touristy'.  Public transport has changed because there are lots of different types of buses.  Some smaller buses go up side roads so that more people in the community can use them.  This article was written by year 5 and 6 children at Linthwaite Clough J, I &amp; EY School during their georgrapy and history and PSCHEE lessons about the local environment.   &lt;br />
