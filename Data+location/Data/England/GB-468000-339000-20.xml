		<content>    In general it seems that life in   
 Bingham is more than acceptable. There
 exists a good, thriving and happy     
 community, which will accept any      
 change for the better but is aware of 
 the problems of modern society and    
 keeps a vigilant eye on potential and 
 existing problems which may affect the
 inhabitants. There has been little    
 mention of older people but there are 
 excellent facilities and residences   
 available to them and they are well   
 cared for.                            
    It only remains to thank the       
 children from all four shools for     
 their ideas and the information they  
 collected, the teachers who           
 assimilated and edited the information
 (K.J.Robinson,P.Renshaw,H.Sylvester   
 and C.Conway) without whom these pages
 would not have been possible.
