		<title>18PETERSFIELD FESTIVAL - YOUTH</title>
		<content> This year six schools took part in the
 Youth Concerts. We always learn the   
 songs at our own schools then practise
 all together before the day. On the   
 day of the concert we all rehearse in 
 the Festival Hall.  We do the same    
 concert on two evenings so all our    
 parents and friends can get in to     
 listen.  We sang "Dracula! or The     
 Vampire Vanquished" by Carey Blyton. A
 group of children from Dunhurst school
 played the accompaniments, and others 
 told the story.  We really enjoyed it.
 The choirs sang some two-part songs   
 and Petersfield School Orchestra and  
 Brass Ensemble played for us. The     
 Area String Orchestra did a group of  
 pieces. At the end we all joined in   
 together to play and sing the March   
 from "Aida" by Verdi.
