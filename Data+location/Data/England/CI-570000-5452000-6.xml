		<title>06ST. CATHERINE FISH TANKS</title>
		<content>    A number of cold sea-water tanks   
 have been built in some of the tunnels
 which were made during the German     
 Occupation. These are inside an       
 enormous rock, locally nicknamed      
{'Gibraltar',}which is at the end of   
 the breakwater nearest to the land.   
 These tanks are filled with shanker   
 crabs, spider crabs and lobsters. The 
 last time I went there they had a     
 monk-fish as a sort of pet. My dad    
 buys all his crabs and lobsters from  
 there for his restaurant.             
                                       
    Most of the fish are caught more or
 less the same day, and taken there to 
 be quite fresh. They are sold fairly  
 cheaply, so many people get a crab or 
 two from there. It is a damp          
 atmosphere and very cold, but it is   
 worth a visit next time you go        
 down there.                           </content>
