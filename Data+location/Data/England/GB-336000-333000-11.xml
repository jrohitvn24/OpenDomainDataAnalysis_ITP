 In the canal you can either float fish
 or ledger.The kind of fish you are    
 likely to catch are Gudgin, Roach,    
 Dace, Rough, Perch and Eels.The sort  
 of thing you would take with you are  
 a fishing rod,reel,two pound line,    
 size 18 hook ,lead weights and float  
 or ledger.You could use worms,maggots 
 or casters for bait.You could also use
 bread.Bread is very good for dace.You 
 could use a swim feeder which is a    
 tube with holes in it which fills with
 maggots. The maggots wriggle so it    
 acts as a form of ground bait. A      
 rodrest is a thin metal pole with a   
 plastic V shape on top which rests    
 part of your rod.A swing tip is placed
 on the end of your rod. It will swing 
 from side to side when you have a     
 bite.
