		<content> When our parents were at school nearly
 all of the children in{Thornaby}were  
 from English families.Now there are   
 many children whose parents were born 
 in India and Pakistan.The mothers of  
 these children usually wear           
 long,brightly coloured clothes,but    
 their fathers wear ordinary English   
 clothes. Some of the men wear turbans.
 Many shops in{Westbury Street}and{    
{Lanehouse Road}are owned by Indians   
 and Pakistanis. The owners work very  
 hard and their shops are open until   
 ten o'clock at night.                 
     Their children go to ordinary     
 schools and they speak good           
 English.Sometimes the children have to
 speak for their parents in shops and  
 schools because the parents cannot    
 speak English. On Fridays many        
 children go to the Mosque in Westbury 
 St.to be taught about their religion. </content>
