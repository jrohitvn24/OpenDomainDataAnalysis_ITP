		<content>{                                      
  The Kirkby Lonsdale area is mainly   
 agricultural with little industry.    
 Situated in the quiet valley of the   
 river Lune, Kirkby itself, with its   
{population}of over 2000, is a small   
 market town which meets the           
 requirements of the surrounding       
 villages.{Market day,}with stalls in  
 the Square, is Thursday.It has a large
 range of shops, catering for both     
 locals and the many{tourists.}It      
 contains the usual services, garages, 
 police and fire stations, as well as  
 schools.Mainly,{farming}is of cattle  
 and sheep, both in valley and fell.   
 There are many traditional stone-built
 farm buildings and dry stone walls,   
 and a multitude of winding country    
 roads and lanes.
