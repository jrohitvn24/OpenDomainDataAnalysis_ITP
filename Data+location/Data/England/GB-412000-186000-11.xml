		<content> Many types of houses have and         
 still are being built.They include    
 terraced,semi_detached and            
 detached.                             
 Being less costly than the            
 others,many of the terraced houses are
 being bought by young married         
 couples.Adults with families usually  
 buy a bigger type of house.A modern   
 church has also been built.The houses 
 have been built by different firms.   
 In the village itself there are       
 old terraced cottages,several council 
 houses,and older detached houses.
