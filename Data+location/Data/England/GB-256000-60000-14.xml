		<title>14LEE MOOR VILLAGE-NO SCHOOLS.</title>
		<content> Twenty years ago there were more      
 children in Lee Moor than there are   
 today.Gradually numbers have dropped, 
 until there are now very few children.
 There was a primary school until two  
 years ago,when it was closed.Now the  
 younger children in the area tend to  
 go to Cornwood Primary school,although
 one goes to Shaugh Prior Primary      
 School.This means that all the        
 children of primary school age have to
 travel.The children of secondary      
 school age travel over 5m to Ivybridge
 Comprehensive school.Some people say  
 that when a village school closes the 
 people living there move too,which    
 seems to be the case.It is true       
 that there is a higher than average   
 retired percentage than normal.Few    
 families seem to be attracted to the  
 area now ,possibly due in part to the 
 lack of local schools.                </content>
