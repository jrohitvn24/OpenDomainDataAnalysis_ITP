 Domesday Block. There are{Parish      
 Churches at Stow, Upper and Lower     
 Swell which are all{very old.}Stow's  
 Church Tower is a landmark for miles  
 around and there are 110 steps to the 
 top. The peal of eight bells is the   
 heaviest in Gloucestershire. There are
 usually about 40/50 people on a Sunday
 morning.                              
 The next oldest church is the{Baptist 
 Chapel. The present building is is 143
 years old but there has been a Baptist
 Church meeting for over 300 years. The
 Sunday congregation is about 60. The  
{Roman Catholic Church}uses a former   
 school building and over 100 people   
 meet for worship. There is a{Methodist
 Church and a{Brethren}Meeting Room.
