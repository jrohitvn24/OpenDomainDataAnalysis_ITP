		<title>06LOWER BARN FARM</title>
		<content>{Lower Barn Farm}is a pig farm and it  
 is the smallest in the district.Mr    
 Tom Potter owns the farm and his son  
 Steven will take it over when he      
 retires. The farm is set on a         
 peaceful road.It is about 118 acres,  
 with  8 fields. Steven was brought up 
 on the farm and thinks his way of life
 is the best. Mr Tom Potter's father,  
 Charles owned the farm before him.    
 Drainage has improved the fields.     
 Steven thinks the next few years will 
 get better.                           
                                       
 He lives quite near the old railway   
 and likes living there. It was        
 dismantled in 1945. He farms here     
 because the building is adapted to    
 pigs. 7 1/2 of the 8 fields are crops 
 and the rest is grassland. Stephen and
 his family shop at ASDA in S.Woodham.
