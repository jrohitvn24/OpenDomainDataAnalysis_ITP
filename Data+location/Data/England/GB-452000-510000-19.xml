		<content> Mr Hodgson, curator of All Saints     
 Church, told us that he had felt cold 
 water running down his back when the  
 clock struck midnight as he was       
 changing the candles in the church.   
                                       
 There is reputed to be a horse and    
 rider which haunts Tanton Bridge,     
 between North and South Tanton Farms, 
 where a rider was killed in an        
 accident many years ago.              
                                       
 A girl who lived in Angrove Hall fell 
 in love with a coachman.  Her father  
 disapproved, the girl later died and  
 her ghost is supposed to haunt the    
 site of the hall.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
