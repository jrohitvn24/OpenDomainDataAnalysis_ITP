		<title>15CHILDREN'S GAMES IN HORNSEA</title>
		<content> We asked approximately 170 children in
 the 7 to 11 age range at Hornsea      
 Primary School what their favourite   
 game was. We divided their answers    
 into 5 categories. They were:-        
                                       
 a) Sports Games                       
 b) Tig                                
 c) Blocky (a form of Hide and Seek)   
 d) Hide and Seek                      
 e) Bike Riding                        
                                       
 All forms of sports games such as     
 football, cricket and rounders were   
 popular with the older children but   
 the traditional games were only played
 regularly by the younger children.It  
 was not expected that riding bicycles 
 would be such a popular activity and  
 another category had to be made to    
 include this.
