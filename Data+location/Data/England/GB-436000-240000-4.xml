		<content> The Mill House in Shenington is next  
 to the church. It is the oldest house 
 in Shenington. It was probably built  
 during the 17th century, but has been 
 repaired since. it is a 2 storey      
 building made of ironstone with a     
 Welsh slate roof. It has              
 stone-mullioned windows with square   
 stone decorations, some of the windows
 blocked. The name of the first owner  
 was Harold Hewins, and Hewin's lived  
 in the house for over 100 years. Mr   
 Court who is a farmer, lives there    
 now. Mill House is a grade 2 listed   
 building. Shutford Manor celebrated   
 its 400th year 6 years ago. Little is 
 known of its history as original      
 documents have disappeared. It        
 belonged to the Saye and Sele family  
 until recent times.
