  The area surrounding Bagnall is      
 policed by community officers from    
Endon.                                 
  They patrol the area at no given time
and while they are on patrol they      
usually call into farms to talk to the 
owner to find out if he has any        
complaints or information for them.    
  The most common complaint is the     
dumping of rubbish on farmland and     
culprits are usually caught.           
  With there being no speed limit in   
Bagnall it is becoming increasingly    
dangerous for the customers of the     
"Stafford Arms" to park in the narrow  
lanes beside the public house.         
  At Christmas the police organise     
special patrols to protect the         
Christmas trees in the nurseries and   
the turkey farms from seasonal thefts.
