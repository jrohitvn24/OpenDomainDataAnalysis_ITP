		<title>03A View From The Trundle</title>
		<content> From the triangulation point at the   
 peak of the Trundle,the view ranges   
 from eighteen to twenty-two           
 miles.Looking in a north-westerly     
 direction,St. Roche's Gate and        
 Singleton Plantation are in clear     
 view.Singleton is situated north      
 of the Trundle,but only the roofs of  
 the houses can be seen.Goodwood       
 racecourse,although not in our        
 allocated area,can be seen looking to 
 the north-east.Westwards is the Seven 
 Points Cottage,which is on the edge of
 Singleton Plantation.A main road,which
 leads to Singleton,surrounds the      
 Trundle,and a junction with a car park
 is to the north-east of the hill.On a 
 clear day,the view is extensive-the   
 Isle of Wight,Portsmouth,Chichester   
 and Chichester Police Station tower   
 mast are all visible from the         
 triangulation point.                  </content>
