		<title>17The M62 Motorway</title>
		<content> We visited the Highway Maintence      
 department of the Wakefield           
 Metropolitan District council.Mr      
 Steeper told us that it was in 1936   
 when the idea for a motorway system   
 was born.The M62 crosses the country  
 from east to west and forms a letter H
 with the A1 &amp; M1.The M62 was not      
 started at one end and continued to   
 the other.It was completed in sections
 so that some parts were in use before 
 others.The first part of the M62 to be
 built was in the Pennines in          
 1967.Detailed plans for the stretch of
 the M62 between intersections 32 &amp; 33 
 began in 1960.Between intersections 32
 and 33 work began in 1972 &amp; finished  
 in 1974.Between the  intersections 32 
 and 33 the road was affected by mining
 subsidence.We saw photographs of crack
 damage to bridges on our stretch of   
 motorway.                             </content>
