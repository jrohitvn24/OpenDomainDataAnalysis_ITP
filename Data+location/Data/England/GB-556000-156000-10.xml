		<content> rafters of the roof.The massive beams,
 the dark thick oaken planks of the    
 floors all denoted a period when great
 stability and duration were desired;  
 when a man built a house it was for   
 succeeding generations.               
       An extension built during the { 
{18th century}includes an original Adam
 fire surround,the bottom part of which
 had to be replaced after the{massive  
{flood in 1968.                        
{     }The present owners have not been
 aware of any{ghosts}but one room on   
 the ground floor will not be entered  
 by the owner's daughter or dog!!      
       One also hears stories but of   
 course these cannot be comfirmed - one
 of which is that a previous owner of  
 the house was involved with the{Gun-  
{powder Plot.}
