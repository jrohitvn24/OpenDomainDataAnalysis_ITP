		<content>      In 1985, Shevington has one      
 policeman, Bill McMath, who lives in  
 the village centre.  He gets around on
 his bicycle.  Although he is on duty 8
 hours a day on a shift system he does 
 get time off to be with his family.   
 He wears a black uniform with silver  
 buttons (to identify himself from     
 other members of the public)          
 consisting of a tall hat, trousers, a 
 coat, belt and black boots.  Part of  
 his job involves checking on local    
 property, cars wrongly parked and     
 ensuring that alcohol is not sold to  
 underage people.  Bill also goes into 
 local schools, getting to know the    
 children, passing on good advice and  
 warnings.  There is little violence in
 the village but assistance can be     
 called by radio and help will arrive  
 in a short time.
