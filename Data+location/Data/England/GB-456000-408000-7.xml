		<title>07Winteringham's Indoor Riding</title>
		<content>  The proprietress of{Winteringham Farm
 gives the horses 20 minutes workout   
 per day on the lunge rein in the      
 indoor shed. They use a long whip to  
 hit the ground so the horses know when
 to speed up and slow down.The ground  
 of the indoor ring is covered with a  
 thick layer of sawdust so it is not   
 hard on the horse's feet.They also    
 have sodium lamps in the shed so the  
 horses are not dazzled when training. 
  The proprietress makes her own horse 
 jumps out of various materials.They   
 have to start jumping over the small  
 ones and then move to the higher      
 poles.                                
  When they are riding the horses,they 
 work for a whole hour. In trials or a 
 competition the horses have to be     
 ridden for extra long periods of time.
