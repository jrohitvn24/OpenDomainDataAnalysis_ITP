		<content> At Cubs we have Peter Smith as Tricky 
 Ricky and at the start, while we      
 group, we have a game of football and 
 my mum collects the invested Cubs'    
 subs.   That is 2Op.   After we have  
 grouped together each six has         
 inspection to get points.   Then we   
 form into a horseshoe shape after one 
 of the leaders says, Pack, pack alert;
 pack, pack, pack!   And we all shout, 
 PACK!  One of the leaders says who is 
 duty six before we start grand howl.  
 The person who is chosen to do grand  
 howl says, Cubs do their best.   And  
 we all say, we will do our best.   We 
 all face the flag and the person who  
 was chosen to do the flag pulls the   
 rope.   We all salute at the flag.    
 We then take off our caps and we      
 usually play a game.   Dodgeball is my
 favourite because you have to dodge   
 the ball.                             </content>
