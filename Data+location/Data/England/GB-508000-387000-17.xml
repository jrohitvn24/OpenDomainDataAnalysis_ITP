		<title>17MARKET RASEN -FARMING</title>
		<content> From the early days when there were 2 
 large arable fields with the pastures 
 and grazing aoround the town. After   
 enclosure in 1780 the modern field    
 system was evolved. Livestock however 
 remains important with large flocks of
 sheep grazing on land let each year   
 for that purpose. There are also small
 herds of Lincoln Red cattle to be     
 seen.Dairy herds of Freisian cows     
 are present in the area too.But, it is
 the arable farming which shows the    
 most changes. Highly mechanised farms 
 with an acreage of about 300 are found
 growing mostly potatoes, cereals,     
 sugar beet and more recently oilseed  
 rape.Peas are also grown (freezing    
 carried out at Grimsby)but the acreage
 has declined.There is a considerable  
 acreage of grass too. The town        
 provides many services for the farmers
 including vets.machinery and supplies.</content>
