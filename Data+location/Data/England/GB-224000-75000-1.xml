		<title>01RUGGED BEAUTY OF NORTH HILL</title>
		<content> North Hill, populated by some 500     
 people living in scattered hamlets and
 isolated farms, among landscape which 
 ranges over grassland, woodland,      
 wetland and moorland, has changed     
 little over the years. Hill farming it
 its main industry. Many farms hav     
 ebeen tenanted by the same families   
 for generations. Most wage earners    
 work out of the area and the children 
 'bus to school' elsewhere. Bus        
 services are resticted, so car        
 ownership is essential. A local repair
 garage is maintained and delivery     
 services are regular. The village     
 stores and post offices, along with   
 thw church. chapel, inn and village   
 hall, play an important part in the   
 rural life. By supporting the many    
 clubs and organisations, the social   
 life is varied. Political life is     
 governed by the Parish Council.       </content>
