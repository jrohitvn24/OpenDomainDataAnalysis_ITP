 children and 1 trumpet, 2 cornets,a

 present,they are building a band hall 
 which will be ready in the Autumn of  
 1985. They perform around 35-40 times 
 each year at village halls, churches  
 and fetes playing all types of music  
 including marches, songs, dances, pop,
 jazz, and classical.

 exchanges with other bands in this
