		<content>  {The Fish Cellars- Port Isaac   }    
     Port Isaac was very famous for its
 kippers throughout the country.You    
 can still see the smokehouse where    
 they used to smoke them.You can also  
 still see the holes in the walls where
 they used to slot in  planks of wood  
 either side of the room.This was part 
 of the balking process.The fishing    
 trade has decreased over the years    
 but,there are still more lobsters     
 caught in  Port Isaac than anywhere   
 else in the country.                  
  {Squeeze Belly Alley Port Isaac      
    This alley is the narrowest        
 thoroughfare in the world. You can    
 find it in Dolphin Street. It is 55   
 cms wide and 1m 94 cms high.          
  {Post Office_ Port Isaac}            
    The Post Office in Fore Street was 
 the old lifeboat house.It is now      
 housed in the cellars near the beach. </content>
