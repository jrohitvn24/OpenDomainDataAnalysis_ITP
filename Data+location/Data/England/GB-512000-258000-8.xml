		<content> Catsey Wood was on record as long ago 
 as 1240.Theyare deciduous woods with a
 lake and cover 31.0 hectares of land. 
 The standards are mainly oak and ash. 
 Amongst the flowers to be found here  
 are ; orchids, strawberry leaved      
 potentilla and violets.               
  Forty Acre Wood is dedicated         
 woodland, the northern half having    
 been clear-felled in the winter of    
 1976/77. This led to a temporary loss 
 of much of it's earlier floristic     
 interest.The lake was constructed     
 during the War. It is about 1 hectare 
 in size and has a marshy fringe which 
 sports such plants as willow herb and 
 lesser speedwort. There is an old     
 moated site here also and this is now 
 surrounded by trees.The rough         
 grassland within the woods is not     
 floristically very rich but it helps  
 to add to the variety of the area.    </content>
