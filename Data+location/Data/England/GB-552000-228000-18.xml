		<title>18Place names around Henham</title>
		<content> Place names in our area show the      
 different ways such names have changed
 over the years.Henham was Henha in the
 first Domesday Book and has changed   
 through Anham,Enham,Henhame to Henham.
 The name comes from Hean=high and Ham=
 settlement and means "at the place of 
 the high ham".Locally the village has 
 been called Henham-on-the-Hill.Ugley  
 takes its name from a local chief     
 Ucga.Ley means a clearing so Ugley    
 means "Ucga's clearing'.The village   
 also has been called Oakley,perhaps   
 because Ugley is not a very           
 complimentary name for a lovely       
 village.Old Mead runs between Henham  
 and Ugley.It takes its name from Ralph
 atte Mead who lived around 1327.
