		<title>12ORSETT CONTAINER BASE DEPOT.</title>
		<content> This was originally an Army camp.With 
 the advent of containers it was to be 
 used as a depot for containers passing
 through Tilbury Dock.The containers   
 were to be unpacked and packed        
 here.This carried on for a short while
 but industrial disputes as to who     
 should pack and unpack the containers 
 caused dock strikes at Tilbury.Dockers
 maintained that they should be the    
 only ones to pack and unpack the      
 containers,within 5 miles of Tilbury  
 Docks.The depot closed down as a      
 result of this and most of the traffic
 transferred to a depot at Barking,some
 12-15 miles away.The depot is now used
 as an overnight stop for containers.It
 is also used as a fumigation centre   
 for containers,to prevent the spread  
 of germs and disease from country to  
 country to conform with hygiene       
 regulations.                          </content>
