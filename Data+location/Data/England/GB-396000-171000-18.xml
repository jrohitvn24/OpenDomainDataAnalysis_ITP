		<title>18Brownies in Calne.</title>
		<content>   My name is Diane Lean.I belong to   
 the 4th Calne pack of Brownies,which  
 is like a club.We do lots of things,  
 like leaf collecting,and learning how 
 to use a telephone box.               
   I go to meetings every week.There   
 are four groups of six girls.The sixth
 in line is called a seconder,the first
 is a sixer.That's what I am.The groups
 are called Imps,Sprites,Gnomes and    
 Elves.I am an Imp.                    
   I am working for my Animal Lovers   
 Badge.I have to look after my pet     
 budgerigar properly for three months. 
 You can win lots of other badges too  
 like the Venture Badge.We leave the   
 Brownies when we are ten and go on to 
 the Girl Guides.                      
   Our uniform is a brown dress with   
 badges we have won sewn on,yellow neck
 tie with silver badge,belt and bobble 
 hat.                                  </content>
