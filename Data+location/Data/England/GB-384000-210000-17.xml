		<title>17OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER</title>
		<content> The Painswick Beacon is a local       
 newspaper which was begun in 1978. The
 aim was to provide an opportunity for 
 people to exchange information.       
   It was founded by Terry Parker and  
 Helen Horton, who formed a committee  
 of eight people.                      
   The first edition was in April 1978,
 but they first met in January 1978.   
 They were given expert advice on the  
 layout, and first of all they use an  
 ordinary typewriter, but now they use 
 an electric typewriter, so that the   
 print is not lighter or heavier in    
 parts. There are usually from four to 
 twelve pages produced on A4 size      
 paper.                                
   Mr Parker, who has been Editor of   
 the Beacon since the start, says that 
 it is not really unique. Anyone can   
 write something for the paper, and it 
 is almost certain to appear.          </content>
