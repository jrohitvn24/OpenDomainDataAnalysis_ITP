		<title>01TYPICAL VALLEY IN E.SUFFOLK</title>
		<content> The block includes the hamlets of     
 Linstead Parva and Chediston both     
 centred round the village church which
 date from the 12th and 13th century. A
 predominantly agricultural area lying 
 on both sides of a shallow east-west  
 valley 10-14 miles from the east      
 coast: until about 20 years ago the   
 farms were mostly under 100 acres but 
 now there are only 5 in this category;
 only two of the larger farms now have 
 dairy herds and one of these also has 
 a large pig unit. There are also 2    
 small pig units, 2 fruit farms, one   
 pick-uour-own soft fruit and vegetable
 farm, one basket maker. Many of the   
 former farm houses are now occupied as
 private houses mainly by people in    
 business in the area; indigenous      
 inhabitants are a minority group: due 
 to the lack of demand for on-farm     
 labour the younger people tend to move</content>
