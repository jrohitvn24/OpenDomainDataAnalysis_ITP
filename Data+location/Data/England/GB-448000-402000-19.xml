		<content>    Harlington and Barnburgh Women's   
 Institute provides monthly            
 meetings,incorporating varied         
 speakers,with news of W.I. activites  
 nationwide.                           
    Members have opportunities for a   
 wide range of sports, crafts, drama,  
 cultural and leisure activities.      
 Shortage of money for local government
 caused an increase in Barnburgh       
 School letting charges, where the     
 meetings began sixteen years  ago.    
 Now,meetings are held in the Church   
 Hall.                                 
    Trees have been planted to improve 
 the environment,refreshments provided 
 at the Carnivals in support of the    
 Village Hall,Cakes sold to aid        
 Barnburgh Male Voice Choir for a      
 'guest' appearance in Northern Ireland
 and sweaters have been knitted for    
 people in famine affected countries.  </content>
