		<title>06THE VICAR OF SOUTHILL</title>
		<content> The vicar of Southill has an extra job
 as well as just being the vicar.In the
 afternoons he trains young people to  
 be vicars.For the rest of the day he  
 conducts services and visits people in
 the parish.A typical service would    
 consist of prayers,hymns and readings 
 from the Bible.The vicar has to wear a
 special tunic and a white 'dog' collar
 for the services.The present vicar of 
 the All Saints Church in Southill     
 began work there in Nineteen Seventy  
 Nine.The church was first built in the
 13th century but parts of it have been
 restored several times since then and 
 only a small part of the original     
 church remains.The present vicar      
 hasn't performed any exorcisms to rid 
 houses of 'evil spirits' but he has   
 prayed with people whose houses have  
 had strange things happening in them.
