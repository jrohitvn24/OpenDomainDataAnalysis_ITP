		<content>   To make beer you need yeast, hops,  
 water, sugar &amp; barley. The yeast has  
 to be mixed carefully or it wil die.  
 We rubbed some hops on our hands to   
 see if we could feel the sticky oils. 
 They boil the water and add the raw   
 materials. It is then put into        
 fermenting tanks for about 5-7 days.  
 When it is ready they put it into     
 cans, bottles &amp; metal kegs.           
   The first thing that hit us was the 
 smell of yeast. The floor was very    
 clean and smelled of bleach. Inside   
 the bottling plant it was very noisy  
 as all of the machines were buzzing   
 and the bottles &amp; cans were rattling. 
 The bottles came from a big washing   
 machine on a conveyor belt and are    
 filled 20 at a time.                  
   We were given a can of Barbican. I  
 found the trip very interesting but it
 put me off beer.                      </content>
