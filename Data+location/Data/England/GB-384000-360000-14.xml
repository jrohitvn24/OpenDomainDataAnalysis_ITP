		<content> Most of the grassland west of         
 Congleton Edge is used for pasture and
 grazing.Where the land started to rise
 it became rocky and rougher.All the   
 fields are fenced off and hedged      
 sometimes with trees and bushes as    
 well.Most of the area west of the old 
 railway is still used for silage.In   
 another field there was a large herd  
 of cows.The rest of the fields are    
 mostly covered with woodland and rough
 grassland.Nearly all the fields are   
 bordered with a fence.This maybe      
 because of poor access to the         
 area.Behind this is a row of trees    
 which acts as a hedge.Nearer Astbury  
 the fieids are mainly for grazing and 
 pasture,with many herds of cows in    
 them.All these fields are very well   
 looked after and have very good hedge 
 boundries.
