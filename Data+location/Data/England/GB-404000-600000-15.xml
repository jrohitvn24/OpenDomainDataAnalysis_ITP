		<title>15B.M.X.Bicycles</title>
		<content> In Rothbury there is a craze for      
 B.M.X. bikes. B.M.X. stands for       
 'Bicycle Motor Cross.' The bicycles we
 use are specially made to perform     
 different tricks. Sometimes you can   
 see people from our school doing      
 "Wheelies" and "Bunny Hops" which are 
 dangerous stunts to perform. One      
 involves balancing on one wheel and   
 the other means jumping into mid air. 
 I live in Netherton which is seven    
 miles from Rothbury and my friend and 
 I look for places to ride our bikes.  
 Once we were able to perform over the 
 mounds made when foundations were     
 started for a new house but we could  
 not do that for long.                 
 B.M.X. is a craze that will not die   
 out quickly. If you are sensible you  
 wear protective gear. There should be 
 a special track built for us in       
 Rothbury.                             </content>
