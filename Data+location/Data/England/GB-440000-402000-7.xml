		<content> The mine is 150 years old and has 3   
 shafts. There are 135 miners working  
 at the pit. The manager is called Mr  
 Pearson. He was very different to what
 I expected because he did not wear a  
 suit or tie,but was smoking a pipe.   
 About 100 years ago a terrible fire   
 occured involving all the pit         
 ponies,some of whom died. Nowadays    
 there is a lot of safety equipment.   
 It is hung up in cloakrooms and       
 consists of a helmet to guard against 
 falling rubble,a safety belt with     
 emergency lights,safety boots and     
 working overalls.                     
   The long strike of 1984/85 affected 
 the community badly. It made life hard
 for everyone.The happiest day for Mr  
 Person was when work was resumed but  
 the pit is due for closure. Eventually
 the site will revert to farmland.
