		<content> Ditcham House estate was mentioned in 
 the Domesday book and is known to have
 been the site of an manor house from  
 the 16th century. Mr L Trent Cave a   
 local benefactor bought the estate in 
 1887 and had the existing building    
 pulled down and replaced with a large 
 Victorian house, which was destroyed  
 by fire before it was occupied.       
 Another house was built. The architect
 was Sir Reginald Bromfield who also   
 designed an English church in         
 Copenhagen. It was furnished with     
 purchases made in Italy and included a
 bathroom with a covered bath so as not
 to offend the eye. Mr Trent Cave      
 founded St Lawrence RC church in      
 Petersfield. He was a distinguished   
 meteorologist who released balloons   
 from Ditcham to record temperature and
 humidity of the upper atmosphere to   
 assist the development of flying.     </content>
