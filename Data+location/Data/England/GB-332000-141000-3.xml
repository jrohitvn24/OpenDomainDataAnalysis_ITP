		<title>03MY HOUSE IN PURITON</title>
		<content>    Out side my{house}the pavement is  
 cracked and we are joined to another  
 house. The birds make a noise on the  
 roof when they jump and nest.There are
 twelve houses in our row and we are   
 the third house along.The road started
 to break up and so the workmen had to 
 put down more tarmac.After nine houses
 there is an area of waste land which  
 leads to the{Quarry.}Sometimes people 
 keep cars and caravans on it.Then     
 there are a few more houses and then  
 there is an opening to the quarry.    
    I live on an estate at 54 Puriton  
 Park.We are joined to number 55.We    
 have got a long garden and across the 
 road they have shorter gardens because
 there are houses behind them.Behind   
 our house and the other eleven is the 
 quarry.
