		<title>05Clifton Wharf</title>
		<content>   The disused railway line has been   
 turned into a nature reserve.There is 
 a weight restriction on lorries coming
 through the village on their way to   
 the motorways and A5.                 
   By the side of the North Oxford     
 Canal is a canal wharf.Boats can be   
 hired or repaired at this wharf.      
   Account by Hannah Brown.            
   "Yesterday I went to the Clifton    
 Wharf.We went to look at the things in
 the shop and also the "Buckby         
 can"(fresh water container)and        
 dipper(scoop),on the table outside.I  
 saw castles and roses on the          
 utensils.Then we went and saw a narrow
 boat.It was very pretty.When we went  
 inside,there were little cupboards.We 
 came out and sat on the grass looking 
 for a four-leafed clover.After an iced
 lolly, we went back to school."
