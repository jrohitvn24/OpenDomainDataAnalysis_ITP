		<content>      We wanted to know more           
 information about our area so we went 
 and interviewed Mrs Briley the        
 landlord's wife at the Angel pub.In   
 the morning Mr and Mrs Briley read the
 morning papers, they don't have       
 breakfast they just get on with the   
 work.The morning session is from      
 11.00 a.m.until 2.30 p.m.From 12.00   
 Mrs Briley does snacks and meals for  
 the bar.Then at 4.00 _ 5.30 p.m.they  
 have their main meal of the day.Then  
 Mr Briley does some cellar work and   
 gets the bar ready for the evening    
 session which is 7.00 _ 11.00 p.m.but 
 it is usually about 11.30 p.m. before 
 they can get the customers to leave   
 the pub.Then they do the cashing out  
 of the till and have supper.Mr and Mrs
 Briley usually go to bed around 12.00 
 midnight or 1.00 a.m..
