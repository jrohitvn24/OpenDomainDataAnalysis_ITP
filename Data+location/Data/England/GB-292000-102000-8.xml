		<title>08   History of Silverton</title>
		<content>    Pigs park, we think, is where      
 people in Silverton first lived. We   
 believe this because part of an       
 encampment was found in this area that
 dates back to the Iron Age (300 B.C). 
                                       
    By Saxon times Silverton,          
 pronounced Silvertone, was a very     
 important village as it was the       
 hundred that included many of the     
 surrounding villages.                 
                                       
    Silverton, we believe, is the only 
 village in Devon to have some 14th    
 century {Hallhouses.}(See Hallhouses);
 there are also a number of later,     
 traditional, cob and thatch cottages. 
                                       
    Silverton owes its size to the fact
 that it was once on the coaching route
 from Exeter to Tiverton.
