		<content> AS GREAT BENTLEY IS A RURAL COMMUNITY,
 HALF WAY BETWEEN COLCHESTER AND       
 CLACTON, EACH A TEN MILE JOURNEY,     
 TRANSPORT IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE. THE 
 MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL MEANS OF        
 TRANSPORT IS PRIVATE CAR. ROADS IN THE
 AREA ARE QUITE GOOD AND CAR ESSENTIAL 
 FOR SOCIAL AND BUSINESS USE.THE SMALL 
 VILLAGES AROUND GREAT BENTLEY ARE     
 PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON CARS FOR    
 ALL TRANSPORT.                        
 THE AREA                              
 IS QUITE FLAT AND CYCLING IS STILL A  
 POPULAR AND USEFUL METHOD OF          
 TRANSPORT. BUS SERVICES ARE SEVERELY  
 RESTRICTED, EXCEPT BETWEEN COLCHESTER 
 AND CLACTON, WITH INDIVIDUAL VILLAGES 
 HAVING A LIMITED SERVICE.  GREAT      
 BENTLEY IS ON THE MAIN EAST COAST RAIL
 LINE, WITH ITS OWN STATION PROVIDING A
 SERVICE DIRECT TO LONDON, STOPPING AT 
 COLCHESTER.                           </content>
