		<title>01S.NORMANTON/PINXTON SUMMARY</title>
		<content>  This block is in a mixed industrial/ 
 residential/farming area on the       
 Notts./ Derbys.border.It contains the 
 villages of{S.Normanton(Pop:7130)     
 and{Pinxton(Population:4477),}which   
 were originally colliery villages.In  
 the last decade the pits have closed. 
  The{M1 Motorway(J.28)}has had a major
 influence on the area.Shortly after   
 its opening,the region was designated 
 part of the{Alfreton/Mansfield Growth 
{Zone.}Since then there has  been rapid
 industrial and residential development
 and the area features more and more   
 prominently in national media reports.
  Unemployment in the area is,however, 
 higher than the national average.     
 The area is served by 1 nursery school
 4 infant schools,two junior schools   
 and one secondary school(without a    
 sixth form.)
