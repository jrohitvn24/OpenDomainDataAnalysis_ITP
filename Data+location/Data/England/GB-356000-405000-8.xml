		<title>08WIGAN JUNIORS FOOTBALL CLUB</title>
		<content>  I go to{Wigan Juniors.}I used to go  
 on Saturday but the season has just   
 finished now. We play at{Robin Park}on
 the astro-turf. Mr. Wiseman is the man
 who takes us. There are{21 teams}in   
 three age groups :- under 12's, under 
 10's and under 8's. The age groups are
 all named after things eg, the U-12's 
 are COLOURS, the U-10's BIG CATS and  
 the U-8's CONQUERORS. I am in Cheetahs
 and we play in orange tops, light blue
 shorts and socks. The winners of the  
 84/85 season for my age group were the
 Leopards. Everyone got a game every   
 Saturday they came. About three weeks 
 ago we had a presentation and everyone
 got two things. If you only got one   
 trophy you got a football as well.
