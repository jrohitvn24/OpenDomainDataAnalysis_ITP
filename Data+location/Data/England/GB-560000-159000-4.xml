		<content> Trosley Country Park was originally   
 part of the Trosley Towers Estate     
 which was owned by the  Waterlow      
 family. During the early 1970's the   
 area was derelict and wild. In 1973   
 Kent County Council bought the area.  
 Three years later the 160 acre park   
 was opened to the public.             
       The main pathway that runs      
 through the centre of the park was    
 once Hamilton Coach Drive which led up
 to the Estate. The land is dominated  
 by deciduous trees. The trees that are
 most common are Oak,Hornbeam,Ash,Beech
 and Sweet Chestnut. Yew and European  
 Larch are the only coniferous         
 species.The park also has some open   
 grazing land.On these slopes you can  
 find some rare wild orchids.The park  
 receives approximatly 10,000 visitors 
 a year and between 250 and 300 cars a 
 week during the summer.               </content>
