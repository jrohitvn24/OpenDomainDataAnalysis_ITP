		<title>08A Bradley Farmer's Job.</title>
		<content>The farmer's job is to make the fields 
grow crops,which he sells.In Bradley he
grows wheat,beans and grass.In the     
winter he ploughs the fields and sows  
the seeds.In the spring and summer he  
looks after the plants,spraying with   
weedkiller and fertiliser,and cutting  
th grass.Autumn is harvest time.He     
combines the wheat and dries it in a   
big barn,he then sells it to be made   
into flour.The grass is grown for the  
cows to eat and their milk is sold.The 
grass is cut in the Spring for hay or  
silage to feed the cows in the winter  
when the grass is not growing.In winter
the cows go  into a barn where they    
have their own cubicles with a carpet  
on the floor and a  trough for their   
food.A machine clears the muck         
away.The beans are harvested when      
they are dried and they are sold for   
cattle feed.                           </content>
