 Hospital Tag can sometimes seem to be 
 a rather silly game. As many people   
 can play as are wanted. One person is{
 IT. He or she has to count up to ten  
 and then chase after everyone else who
 is playing the game. When somebody is 
 caught he/she has to hold whatever    
 part of their body they were caught   
 by, &lt;e.g. legs, arms, fingers, head>. 
 When three people have been caught the
 first person who was caught becomes   
 IT.                                   
                                       
 A final Tag type game that is very    
 popular is{British Bulldog.           
                                       
 This is a rough game and people can   
 get hurt.
