		<content>   People from our area do their main  
 shopping in Wellington, Telford,      
 Shrewsbury, Much_Wenlock and          
 Bridgnorth.                           
   Our survey showed that 68% of local 
 people shop at Shrewsbury, 11% at     
 Telford, 9% at Wellington, 6% go to   
 Much_Wenlock but only 1% go to        
 Bridgnorth. Shrewsbury and Telford    
 have big super_markets which are      
 cheaper than a small local shop where 
 we might buy single items.            
   Here are some current prices: an    
 800g loaf of bread costs about 40p,   
 milk is about 23p pt. A litre bottle  
 of orange squash costs around 49p, 1kg
 of sugar costs around 48p, a can of   
 coke 17p, a dozen small eggs  about   
 65p, 500g of butter 47p and 1 pound of
 cheese would be about Â£1.20.
