		<content> 2) {HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED IN THIS   
{HOUSE? }Five out of six people had    
 either lived there all their lives or 
 from an early age. One lady, now 84   
 has had five different addresses in   
 the village, all very close to each   
 other.                                
 3) {WERE YOU, OR ANYONE IN YOUR       
{FAMILY, EVER INVOLVED IN SOME WAY WITH
{THE LAND IN THIS AREA?}All            
 interviewees had had, or still have,  
 some connection with the land. One    
 family buys all the grain grown by the
 local farmers, others had grown       
 potatoes, strawberries, raspberries   
 and flowers, most of the produce was  
 sent to London or Leeds, but some     
 strawberries were sold to a local     
 canning factory.
