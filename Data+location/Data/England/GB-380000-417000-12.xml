		<title>12Tourism around Scoutmoor.</title>
		<content> The building of the M66 motorway meant
 that many properties were demolished  
 to make way for the routeway.         
 Nevertheless, several footbridges     
 were built to ensure that the         
 various footpaths and walks, including
 the Rossendale Way, were maintained.  
     Bury Old Road is part of an       
 ancient highway which can still be    
 traced from Bury to Rawtenstall and   
 which was in use until the new        
 turnpike road was built at the        
 beginning of the 19th Century. The    
 Rossendale Way itself passes into     
 Bleakholt Road turning right onto     
 Rochdale Road at Turn Village. From   
 here follow the steps leading up to a 
 stile below a restored farmhouse.     
 Beyond this the path climbs the       
 shoulder of Scoutmoor. On a clear day 
 Greater Manchester and the hills of   
 the Peak District can be seen.        </content>
