		<content>   After I get up I make my bed and get
 dressed. I go downstairs have some    
 cornflakes and then I feed the fish. I
 then go upstairs and get a good wash  
 and clean my teeth. Then I get my coat
 and bag. I set off for school with my 
 sister Tina.                          
   When we get to the Lollipop Lady we 
 meet some friends and walk to school  
 with them. At the school gate we wait 
 until the bell has gone then we go in.
   We begin with some sort of maths    
 then we go on to something like       
 History or English until playtime.At  
 playtime I play tennis with a friend  
 in the playground. After playtime we  
 do sewing or Beta work.               
   Some children go home for dinner    
 because of a Teacher's dispute.
