		<content>{Ashton }is a small village situated   
 on the South West coast of Cornwall.  
 It has a population of about 300      
 people. It lies on the lower slopes of
 Tregonning Hill, a large granite hill 
 mass typical of Cornwall. It lies four
 miles west of Helston and ten miles   
 east of Penzance. Many of the         
 buildings in the village are quite    
 old. Some, in the centre of the       
 village, are over three hundred years 
 old. These older buildings are built  
 of {granite}and {metamorphic}rocks    
 such as slate and shale. The newer    
 buildings are made of concrete blocks.
