		<title>01COUNTRY WEST OF KEMPSFORD</title>
		<content> The greater part consists of two      
 parishes,{Castle Eaton}and{Marston    
{Meysey,}with the western edge of      
{Kempsford}(including the hamlet of    
{Dunfield).}The latter two may be      
 considered as fringe Cotswold villages
 from their architecture and           
 allegiances. The area is shared       
 between{Gloucestershire}and{Wiltshire 
 with the two former villages lying in 
{Wiltshire.}The{River Thames}is the    
 county boundary for some distance     
 although a finger of land containing  
{Marston Meysey}projects northwards    
 into{Gloucestershire.}The land is     
 flat, farm land. Winding, grass-verged
 narrow roads join the communities and 
 lead out to the "A" roads and towns.  
 The Royal Air Force airfield          
 (generally known as{RAF Fairford)}lies
 within the parish of{Kempsford}.
