		<content>    In appearance Oreton is a dispersed
 settlement with no visible centre but 
 it is a close community. Its          
 lifestyles are various and resourceful
 with many families pursuing several   
 occupations and skills. Within the    
 area one can have a refectory table   
 made to order, animals transported to 
 market, a cottage renovated and       
 extended, car bodies and farm         
 machinery repaired or a poodle dog    
 clipped. The area abounds in farmers, 
 nurserymen and beekeepers. There is a 
 cameo glass artist, a working         
 wheelwright's shop, a piano teacher   
 and an horologist. A new handle can be
 fitted to a hoe or spade, tools       
 sharpened, a picture painted or your  
 hair cut. A resident band will play   
 for dancing and there is a dance band 
 caller. There is too a lace maker in  
 the area.                             </content>
