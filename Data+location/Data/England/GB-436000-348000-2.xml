		<title>02MY TOWN ,RIPLEY</title>
		<content> Ripley is quite a large town but there
 are hardly any factories or places    
 for men to work.Most women stay in    
 Ripley to work but most men go out of 
 the town.I think it is a busy town    
 with many shops.There isn't much      
 countryside in Ripley it has all been 
 taken away to make roads or for the   
 opencast mines.Ripley has two main    
 parks Crossley Park and the Barnes    
 Wallace Park that has only a few      
 swings and a slide .My favourite      
 building is Shirley Road School built 
 in 1915 but I don't like the new      
 buildings like Kwik Save and the Co-op
 Pricefighters.The only places in      
 Ripley for the whole family to go to  
 is the Leisure Centre and the Cinema.I
 go to the park quite often.Even though
 there aren't a lot of things to do in 
 Ripley I don't want to change         
 anything.                             </content>
