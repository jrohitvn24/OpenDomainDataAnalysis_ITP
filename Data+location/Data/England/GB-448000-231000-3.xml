		<content>                                       
   Aynho now has about 10 thatched     
houses; most of the original thatch    
having been replaced with slate. The   
new houses have got tiled roofs. Most  
of the houses are of stone except for 4
brick houses down by the station.      
   In our village 97(43%) of houses    
were built before 1918; 37(16%) between
1918 and 1960; 92(41%) since 1960.     
There are 9 brick houses which have    
been rendered built 1918-1960.         
   All the houses are very expensive.  
Most of the modern houses are detached 
but many of the older cottages are     
terraced. There are a few semi-detached
   The modern houses are built on      
estates called Portway Gardens,        
Cartwright Gardens, The Butts, The     
Glebe and Butts Close.
