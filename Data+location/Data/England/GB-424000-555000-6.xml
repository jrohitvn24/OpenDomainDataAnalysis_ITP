		<content> Birtley's employment pattern is fairly
 typical of Gateshead. One third of the
 population is employed in             
 manufacturing industries. Over 43% of 
 these are men.                        
    Over 7O% of all working women are  
 employed in the catering retail       
 distribution trades, such as shops.   
    There is a slightly below average  
 number of men working in the          
 construction industries. 2O men work  
 in agrciculture and 16O in Energy and 
 Water and 22O work in the Transport   
 industry.                             
    Unemployment is still a problem in 
 Birtley and will only be solved with  
 government help.                      
    The council hope that some large   
 company will take over empty factory  
 buildings and create new jobs.
