 There is not a resident{policeman}in  
 the{Denwick area,}but a policeman     
 regularly patrols the village in a    
 police car.The police feel that this  
 is sufficient security as there have  
 been no{burglaries}in the village for 
 a long time. The only disturbance that
 occurs in Denwick is{vandalism,}      
 damaging the telephone box and        
 spreading{litter.}Most litter is near 
 the {one small bin}because it is      
 rarely emptied.There has been some    
 trouble with {Gipsies}who have been   
 known to take advantage of the elderly
 population.The people of the village  
 are happy with the policing of the    
 area and like living in Denwick mainly
 because it is quiet and trouble free. 
 They know eachother very well and soon
 realise if anything is not as it      
 should be.                            </content>
