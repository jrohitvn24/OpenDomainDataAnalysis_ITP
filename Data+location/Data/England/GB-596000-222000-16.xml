		<title>16The Square,Shrub End.</title>
		<content>  {The Square}forms a focal point for  
 many people in Shrub End, being a     
 meeting place as well as a shopping   
 area.                                 
   The chip called "John's fish bar"   
 was built 30 years ago.               
   People from schools go there at     
 lunch time.                           
   At night skin heads meet by the     
 square to glue sniff and smoke.       
   The shops are used by local people  
 for shopping.                         
   The Co-op was opened on October 22  
 1956 and has since been enlarged. It  
 was the first self service shop in    
 Colchester and used to deliver.       
   Lavell's run a good newsagent's     
 shop in the square.                   
   Recently, the Square was improved,  
 and a car park was created.
