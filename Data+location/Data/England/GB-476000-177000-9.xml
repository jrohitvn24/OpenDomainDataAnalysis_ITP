		<title>09WARGRAVE VILLAGE FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>{The Wargrave Festival}occurs every    
 second year.{The Theatre Workshop}puts
 on a musical,{The Wargrave Runners}   
 organise a mini-marathon and other    
 village societies hold events. The    
 highlight is the{Procession}of floats 
 through the village to{Mill Green     
 which is by the Church. This year the 
 theme of the procession was{Sports and
{Recreation}through the ages.          
                                       
 The Green resembles an outdoor market 
 with decorated stalls and a bandstand.
 Visitors can buy refreshments, craft  
 items and play games like Hoopla.     
 Money raised is shared between the    
 group organising each stall and the   
 Festival organisers. At a village     
 meeting it is decided how to use the  
 profit for the benefit of the         
 community.
