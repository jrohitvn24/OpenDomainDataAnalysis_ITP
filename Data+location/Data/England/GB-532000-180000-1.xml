  Our rectangle is probably the  most  
crowded in the country. It contains    
major tourist attractions (The Tower   
of London, Tower Bridge), the          
financial capital of the World (the    
City), an area of unprecedented change 
(the  London Docklands), a massive     
immigrant  community in the East End,  
the Barbican Arts Centre and a         
treasure trove of archaeological and   
historical interest.                   
                                       
   With only three schools             
participating it has been enormously   
difficult to gather and sift all the   
information, and then to portray       
accurately this wide ranging culture.  
Children of families from many nations 
have contributed, and this view of old 
and new London is predominantly through
their eyes.                            </content>
