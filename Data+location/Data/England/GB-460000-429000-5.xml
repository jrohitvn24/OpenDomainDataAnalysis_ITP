		<title>05A CHILD'S DAY - BRAYTON</title>
		<content> Saturday is my favourite day, &amp; for me
 that starts at about 6:30am, when I   
 read in bed until breakfast time.     
 Breakfast is usually cereal, &amp; a cup  
 of coffee &amp; a grapefruit - if I'm     
 lucky. After breakfast I usually pick 
 up my guitar and bang out a few chords
 on that, which annoys my mum immensely
 as she prefers{"Greensleeves"}to      
{"Status Quo"!}If I'm not going to town
 or the library, the{Saturday Picture  
{Show}forces me into my untidy bedroom 
 where I write music. This brings me up
 to lunch time. After lunch I get my   
 rabbit out of her hutch, &amp; she takes  
 me for a run round the garden. After  
 this I am usually tired so I sit in   
 the lounge &amp; play my guitar up to tea 
 time, when I have toast. Subsequently 
 I read until bedtime.
