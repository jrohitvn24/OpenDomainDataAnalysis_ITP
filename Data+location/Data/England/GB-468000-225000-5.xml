		<content> The{post war years}between 1945 and   
 1960 brought a number of council and  
 private houses.In all 125 houses were 
 built,50% of these being              
 semi-detached,35% being terraced and  
 only 20% detached houses.However 17   
 bungalows were built mainly           
 "infilling" between existing          
 dwellings,whereas the majority of     
 houses were built on{small housing    
{estates.}2 more shops were built      
 bringing the total to 7 the number    
 trading today.                        
 The building "boom" existed between   
 1960 and 1984.The general pattern has 
 been the establishment of{cheaper     
{starter homes}for young               
 families,followed by larger houses.Of 
 290 dwellings built,154 were smaller  
 terraced houses,with 64 detached,38   
 semi-detached and 34 bungalows.More   
 building is planned.                  </content>
