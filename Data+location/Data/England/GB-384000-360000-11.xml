		<title>11MACCLESFIELD CANAL</title>
		<content> A major feature on our block is the   
 Macclesfield Canal.The canal's use has
 changed from shipping coal to the     
 wharves and TRANSPORTING goods for the
 various industries in the town.Now its
 major use is for RECREATION and barge 
 holidays.Once a year a boat called the
 Mary Sunley,owned by the Macclesfield 
 Voluntary Services,comes to Congleton.
 It brings old people down for a day   
 trip and sometimes it brings disabled 
 people who enjoy it very much.On the  
 canal is a Snail Bridge_it is a       
 squiggly shape and the path over it is
 cobbled.There are many fish in the    
 canal and shrubs,hedges and trees     
 growing by the side.When we walk along
 the canal we meet people fishing and  
 sometimes we see people taking their  
 dogs for walks.
