		<title>01THE FAILAND PLATEAU.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The area is generally a {plateau} of  
 around 100 metres high.The main land  
 uses are 1.{farmland (pasture)}2.{    
{woodland (decidous) }3.{sports fields 
{(golf)}and 4. {parkland.}Failand was  
 the main village (which is in the     
 south west). The two main roads are   
 the A369 which runs from Bristol to   
 Clevedon. We did not see any          
 shops,factories,or any Police         
 stations.There are few roads but they 
 are long and straight. Also there are 
 a few streams. There is a quarry about
 80-100 metres deep and is in the west 
 of  our area.There are good views over
 Bristol and Avonmouth. We could see   
 the M5 Motorway bridge over the river 
 Avon.
