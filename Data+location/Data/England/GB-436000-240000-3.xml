		<title>03History Shenington/Alkerton</title>
		<content> Shenington appears twice in the       
 Domesday book. The derivation of the  
 name being village on the shining     
 hill, it originally being Senendone.  
 The Saxons ploughed the land in       
 terraced steps. There is evidence of  
 Roman settlement, a coin being found  
 in 1984 and a Roman Whorl more        
 recently. In the Civil War Shenington 
 was a King's village. On May 13 1721  
 Shenington suffered a fire, some      
 houses being rebuilt. In 1844         
 Shenington became part of Oxfordshire 
 (prior to that it had been            
 Gloucestershire). Alkerton has always 
 been a small village. In 1641 there   
 were 29 men over the age of 18. In    
 1969 there were 22 men over this age. 
 At the time of the Civil War it was   
 often pilaged by the Parliamentarians 
 of Banbury.
