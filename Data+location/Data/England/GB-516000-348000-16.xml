		<title>16Local History-South Kyme</title>
		<content> South Kyme has always been an isolated
 settlement, surrounded by fenland.    
 Its' river, the Kyme Eau flows to the 
 Witham.                               
  The mediaeval tower is all that      
 remains of a complete castle, begun in
 14th. century, ruined in 18th.century.
  The south aisle of the church is also
 part of a much larger structure- a    
 12th. century priory for Black Canons.
  The name Kyme derives from the de    
 Kymes, lords of the manor from Domes- 
 day until 1338. The pub name, 'Hume   
 Arms',(being changed to Simon d'kyme),
 comes from Abraham Hume, Duke of New- 
 castle,who bought the village in 1748.
  The school (closed 1984), and many   
 houses bear the initials of members of
 the Cust family, who had them built.  
 They were the last lords of the manor,
 retaining links with the village until
 recently.                             </content>
