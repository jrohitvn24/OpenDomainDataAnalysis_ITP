		<content>The most popular activities in the     
Staining area are various sports and   
gardening. The sports include golf,    
tennis, badminton, cricket, rugby and  
snooker. The most popular sport was    
swimming which was done once or twice a
week. Two other popular activities were
gardening and DIY. In a survey of our  
school families most people gave       
enjoyment as their main reason for     
following their sport or hobby. They   
thought they had the benefit of fresh  
air, excercise and social contact. The 
sports facilities of Staining village  
were considered very poor. There is a  
swimming pool at Newton Hall Camp but  
it is open only to members of their    
club and other clubs. For other sports 
facilities people have to travel to    
nearby larger towns such as Blackpool  
or to Stanley Park.  Minor sports      
included parachuting and  modelling.   </content>
