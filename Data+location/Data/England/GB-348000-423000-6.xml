		<title>06A SCOUT GROUP AT LONGTON</title>
		<content>   {Second Longton (Saint Andrew's)    
{Scout Group}is a  sponsored open Group
 which has existed in Longton since    
 1935. There are now six sections, a   
 Beaver Colony,2 Cub Scout Packs,2     
 Scout Troops and a Venture Scout Unit,
 making a total of 150 people.         
    We also run a band with drums and  
 bugles which, since April, has        
 included a few Girl Guide players.    
    This year the Cubs are             
 concentrating on World Conservation.  
 Everyone is collecting waste paper and
 glass for re-cycling. The boys have   
 also learned how tuning a car engine  
 helps to reduce the amount of         
 pollution in the atmosphere.          
    The Troops own 10 canoes and a     
 dinghy but they have to tow them for 8
 miles to the nearest suitable mere.   
    The Venture Unit and Beaver Colony 
 have been formed in the last 2 years. </content>
