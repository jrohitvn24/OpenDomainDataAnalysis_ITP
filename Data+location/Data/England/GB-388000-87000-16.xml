		<content> There is a large fish on one of the   
 walls of the house.  Part of the house
 is built from stone which came from   
 the old Wareham Bridge."              
 The original route of the river Piddle
 was altered into an artifically con-  
 structed section which contains pools 
 and a salmon ladder for salmon rearing
 This happened about 100 years ago.    
 A child's description of the waterfall
 "When we went to Trigon Farm we went  
 to the waterfalls.  At the sides were 
 sluice gates.  The gates allow the    
 meadows to be flooded during the sum- 
 mer to make good pasture land.  There 
 is also a water wheel."
