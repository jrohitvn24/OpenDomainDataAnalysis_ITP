		<title>04WEATHER IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> The weather around Helmshore is not   
 very good and it rains quite a lot.   
                                       
 Helmshore is in a valley and the      
 clouds can't go away very easily, so  
 it rains longer than in most places in
 Britain.                              
                                       
 The weather sometimes puts people off 
 but it is not that bad because of the 
 lovely countryside and walks that are 
 to be found within the area. In the   
 evenings it is usually mild, with many
 red skies on summer evenings.         
                                       
 It rains quite a lot, but Helmshore is
 still a very pleasant place to visit.
