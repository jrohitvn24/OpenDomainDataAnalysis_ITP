		<title>09A DAY IN THE LIFE OF part 2</title>
		<content> We took turns climbing the tree. We   
 carried on. Peter saw some rabbits but
 I didn't. We walked quietly through a 
 field of sheep by the old deserted    
 house without any windows. Near Bumpit
 House we climbed over the fence &amp; down
 the hill. We took some more photos    
 then walked up the other hill. At last
 we were nearly home. We walked past   
 Lynsted Church &amp; opened our gate &amp;    
 walked up our garden path &amp; went      
 inside. I put my used film into an    
 envelope to send off. I asked my dad  
 for some lunch because my mum works in
 Sittingbourne library five days &amp;     
 sometimes six days a week so my dad   
 normally gets lunch &amp; supper ready. He
 also comes early from Christ Church   
 College in Canterbury at about half   
 past three or sometimes a bit later.
