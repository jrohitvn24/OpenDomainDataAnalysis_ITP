		<title>16COMMUNITY SHOP</title>
		<content> In 1984 the village Co-op was closed, 
 despite protests from the             
 inhabitants.The Tenants and residents 
 then formed a Village Committee and   
 commenced the long and frustating     
 negotiations to open a Village        
 Community Shop.The Greater London     
 Enterprise Board promised the money   
 for this, if the residents could raise
 Â£5000. Currently they have raised     
 Â£5900.                                
 This venture has been described in the
 "Independant Grocer" as a landmark, as
 it is proposed to use the profits for 
 the benefit of the village.It is also 
 hoped that the other shops will       
 benefit as their trade has been       
 adversely affected by the fact that a 
 focal point in the village has gone.  
 The concern is that the High Street   
 should not become an area that fails  
 to serve its own community.           </content>
