		<content> MY HOUSE IS A THREE-BEDROOMED COUNCIL 
 HOUSE IN WATERS ROAD.  WE HAVE ABOUT  
 TWELVE ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES WHICH I  
 THINK IS TOO MANY.  I'VE GOT TWO      
 BROTHERS AND ONE SISTER, A MUM AND A  
 DAD.  ALTOGETHER WE HAVE FOUR CARS IN 
 THE FAMILY.  TWO OLD BANGERS BOTH     
 BELONGING TO ONE OF MY BROTHERS, A    
 LADA BELONGS TO MY FATHER AND AN OLD B
 REGISTRATION MINI BELONGS TO MY OTHER 
 BROTHER BUT MY SISTER OFTEN DRIVES IT.
 OUR FRONT GARDEN IS QUITE BIG AND THAT
 IS WHERE MY DAD USUALLY PARKS HIS CAR 
 BUT THE TWO BANGERS ARE THERE AT THE  
 MOMENT - ONE ON THE GRASS.  WE HAVE 6 
 DIFFERENT SORTS OF PET AND 13         
 ALTOGETHER.  THEY ARE 2 FERRETS, A    
 HAMSTER, A BUDGIE, 4 STICK INSECTS, A 
 CAT AND 4 FISH.  OUR BACK GARDEN IS   
 QUITE BIG.  IT HAS A PATIO WHICH MY   
 DAD BUILT AND A NICE LAWN.
