		<content> A Description of the Village.         
 Gawsworth is a split sight village,   
 the older half in the south based     
 around an old crossroads, containing  
 the Hall and Church.The northen       
 portion of the village,(beyond the    
 scope of our block,) is an extension  
 of the Macclesfield suburbs.          
 The southern concentration has two    
 phases of development, pre1960 and    
 post 1960.The older development is    
 clustered around the road junction,   
 while the modern estate was built     
 during the early 70s when expansion   
 doubled the size,the old school       
 closed and the post office moved      
 both in new premises.                 
 There are several hamlets scattered   
 around,Newbarn,Gandysbrook and Moss   
 Houses. Around the Hall and Church is 
 a small settlement of C18th houses.
