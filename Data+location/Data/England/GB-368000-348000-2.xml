		<title>02Wybunbury Moss</title>
		<content>  Wybunbury Moss lies a few hundred    
 yards North of the village and is     
 roughly oval in shape (700 yards long,
 300 yards wide).It covers about 27    
 acres.                                
                                       
  The moss was formed at the end of the
 Ice Age.Its formation was probably due
 to pockets of salt, brought during the
 Ice Age gradually being washed away.  
 The soil above would then have        
 collapsed leaving the hole in which   
 the Moss was formed.                  
                                       
  The Moss was declared a nature       
 reserve because it is one of the last 
 unspoiled peat-mosses in Cheshire,    
 indeed there is only one other similar
 moss in Europe.It consists of a       
 central peat bog on which birch, pine 
 and sallow trees grow. The main body  
 of the moss is sphagnum moss.         </content>
