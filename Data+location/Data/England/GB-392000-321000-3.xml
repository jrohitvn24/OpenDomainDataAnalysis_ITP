		<content>The horses have to be 3 years old      
before they are trained.    If they are
fit they work to the age of twenty.    
The policemen take it in  turns to look
after the horses. It costs 1,000 pounds
a year to feed one horse.     There are
twelve horses altogether at the        
Staffs Police HQ..      The horses come
from all over the country and they are 
mostly three-quarters Irish bred       
hunters.                               
          The horses are always big ,at
present the biggest is 17.2 hands. The 
Staffs Police Force have been using    
horses for 120 years.     The policemen
use the horses for duty at football    
matches, demonstrations and public     
fetes. They patrol Cannock Chase every 
day and give the Chase particular      
attention during the Summer months and 
in December when poaching of animals,  
and theft of Christmas Trees occurs.   </content>
