 the Brownie Movement in 1985.We have

 Flora Dance.                          
  We play lots of games at Brownies,I  
 will tell you about one."Winker"_All  
 the Brownies get in a circle,while one
 person goes outside.One of the circle 
 is chosen as the winker.The person    
 outside comes in and has to find out  
 who is doing the winking.As a person  
 is winked at she pretends to be dead. 
 We also play "Family Car","Traffic    
 Lights"and others.
