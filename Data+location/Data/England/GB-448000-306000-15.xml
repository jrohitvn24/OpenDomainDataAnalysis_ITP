		<title>15THE M1 MOTORWAY AT RATBY.</title>
		<content>    The M1 Motorway has a profound     
 effect on this area,mainly because it 
 bisects it almost precisely in a SE-NW
 direction.The building of the motorway
 in 1966 contrived to cut through farms
 and through Martinshaw Wood,the       
 principal feature of the area.It now  
 provides the major road link from     
 London to the Midlands and the North. 
    Traffic on the motorway is         
 inevitably heavy,the following table  
 giving some idea of this:             
                                       
                                       
            Southbound   Northbound    
 MAY 15th     1800          2260       
                                       
 JULY 15th    1674          1620       
                                       
 Both are hourly rates at 1500         
 hours.Lorries constitute one third of 
 all traffic counted.                  </content>
