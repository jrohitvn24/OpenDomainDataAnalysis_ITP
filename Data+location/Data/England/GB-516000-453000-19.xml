		<title>19MY PONY SOPHIE</title>
		<content> Sophie is 13.HH eight years old dapple
 grey mare.She has got a full white    
 mane and tail, and when she walks she 
 holds her tail up and curls her head  
 in.She's half Arab,and bomb proof in  
 traffic and an all-rounder.She is very
 good at dressage when she doesn't     
 want to jump.I've jumped three foot   
 and two inches on her but she can     
 jump at least four foot or more.She's 
 very flighty and sometimes likes to   
 canter on the road.At summer Sophie   
 is grass kept but in winter she is    
 stabled at night.In summer I give     
 Sophie two flaps of hay and some      
 carrots,and some turnip.In winter she 
 has four flaps of hay and a feed a    
 day and sometimes when you do up her  
 girth she sometimes nips.
