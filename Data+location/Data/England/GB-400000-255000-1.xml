		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA</title>
		<content> This pleasant area of Worcestershire  
 in the West Midlands has easy access  
 to several tourist centres including  
 Stratford-on-Avon, Warwick, the       
 Cotswolds, Worcester on the River     
 Severn and the Malvern Hills. The main
 motorways are in easy reach.          
 The two main villages, Inkberrow and  
 Abbots Morton, are surrounded by      
 agricultural land. Inkberrow, which   
 has a population of approximately     
 2000, has been developed over the last
 20 years into a commuter village.     
 Abbots Morton has not changed in size 
 or character for the last two         
 centuries, although half of its       
 population of approximately 150       
 commute to their places of work.
