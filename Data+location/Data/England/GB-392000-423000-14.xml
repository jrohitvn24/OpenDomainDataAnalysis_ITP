		<content>   The town sits on the border of      
 Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the red 
 and white roses are entwined on the   
 towns crest.The River Calder is       
 culverted underneath the Town Hall and
 traditionally divided the county      
 boundaries.Statues on the Town Hall   
 depict the Lancashie cotton connection
 and the Yorkshire woollen industry.   
   Today the town is officially in West
 Yorkshire and Calderdale for          
 administrative purposes, but the      
 Lancashire connection is still very   
 strong.                               
   Todmorden Cricket Club plays in the 
 famous Lancashire League.The postal   
 address is Lancashire and the B.B.C.  
 local news is from the North-West.    
   Despite this dual identity, people  
 have a strong sense of independence   
 and committment to the town itself.
