 The church was originally built in    
 1324.We think the church was burned   
 down before that,because a burnt      
 coin,dating from the reign of Richard 
 the Lion Heart and some burnt stone   
 were found.                           
   In Stebbing church there is a {stone
{screen.}There are only {three in the  
{world. }The other two are at Great    
 Bardfield and Trondheim in Norway.It  
 separates the nave and the choir.     
   Priests used to have a bridge across
 the nave and there are steps in the   
 wall of the church  where it was.There
 is a 200 year old clock with only one 
 hand.                                 
   There are two Black Death graves in 
 the church yard,dated 1635 and 1678.  
   Only one stained glass window       
 survived the vandalism of the Round-  
 heads during the Civil War.           </content>
