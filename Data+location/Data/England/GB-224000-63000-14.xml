		<content> A junior school survey found 70 names 
 of playground games,30 of which were  
 versions of the game'Tig'where one    
 child is'It'and has to touch or 'Tig' 
 another.This person becomes 'It'.The  
 variations included having a number of
 safe bases;using a ball;joining hands 
 when tigged;'tigged'people having to  
 freeze but later released by free     
 people;and even 'tigging'by jumping on
 somebody's shadow.Other popular games 
 were ball games including football,   
 hand cricket, piggy in the middle and 
 several throwing games.Language games 
 mainly involved answering questions or
 the checking of letters in a child's  
 name before the child could perform a 
 set action.Rhyming games usually meant
 that the players were eliminated one  
 by one as various actions were        
 performed to a rhyme.Less popular were
 body contact,solo and silent games.   </content>
