		<content>On week days we get up at 7.30.        
We have breakfast of cereal,toast      
and a cup of tea then Mum and Dad go to
work and we go to school. In some homes
only one parent goes to work,usually   
Dad. Mum   stays to look after the     
baby and do the house work. We         
have sandwiches or  a school dinner    
and go back home at 3.30pm.  We have a 
cooked tea sausages or fishfingers and 
chips or something on   toast. We      
watch television and play until bed    
time at about 10.00.  At  weekends we  
get up later, shop and visit our       
relations. Dad often goes to the club  
and sometimes does some gardening or   
washes up.  We have electric           
appliances to do the house work,       
vacume cleaners, dishwashers, automatic
washing machines. We have just had a   
microwave for fast cooking.I earn      
pocket money by helping with jobs.     </content>
