		<title>08The Vicar of Trinity Church</title>
		<content>Yesterday we went to interview the     
vicar of Holy Trinity Church Mr Paul Le
Sueur.He told us that the church was   
built in 1848 and showed us plans of   
what they were going to change in the  
church;such as putting in toilets,a    
kitchen and a playroom.                
  Before the church was there the land 
was just countryside.He told us that   
the church measured roughly 35metres by
20metres and there are some 25 stained 
glass windows.The vicar told us that   
the church is a daughter church of     
Rotherfield Greys.                     
  He holds three services a week all on
a sunday and about 130 people attend   
these services.The church itself is    
made of stone,flint facing and         
brick;there are also three hand wrung  
bells.
