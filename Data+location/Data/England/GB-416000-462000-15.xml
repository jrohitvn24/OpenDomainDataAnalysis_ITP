		<content> The other Mills:                      
 NEW YORK MILL: was opened in 1825 and 
 the thread was sent down to the       
 weaving mill in Knaresborough. In 1883
 after a great flood the mill was      
 bought by Thomas Gill and sons who    
 started producing string.  In 1965 the
 mill started spinning fibres for      
 carpet weaving and it finished        
 production in 1980.                   
 Today, New York is the site for many  
 small businesses, namely a gun delaer,
 a welder, a joiner, a wine distributer
 and a carpet wholesaler and           
 manufacturer, to name but a few. The  
 Summerbridge Fire Station is based    
 there and many of the former workers' 
 cottages have now been modernized and 
 become private dwellings.             
 One of the mills in Low Laithe is now 
 a restaurant,but all others there and 
 in Smelthouses are private residences.</content>
