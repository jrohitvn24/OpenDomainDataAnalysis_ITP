		<title>16Social Care D/Worth W. Grove</title>
		<content> A social worker's task in Denchworth  
 is mainly with the aged where she has 
 to find home helps, special aids for  
 arthritis, nursing help etc. She works
 alongside the health visitors.        
 Together they make sure the elderly   
 are safe, well fed and healthy.       
 Sometimes 'meals on wheels' are       
 provided. In W.Grove her main work is 
 quite different. There she helps find 
 registered childminders for working   
 mothers. Sometimes she needs to place 
 children in need or at risk, with     
 foster parents. Occasionally she helps
 a handicapped child or takes into care
 a teenager who has got into trouble.  
 She gives guidance to the unemployed  
 as to the benefits they can claim to  
 help pay their debts. There are, at   
 present, no problem families in       
 Denchworth and only one in W. Grove.
