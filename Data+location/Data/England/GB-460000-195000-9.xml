   On sports day we have races. We     
have  four teams, red, green,yellow    
and blue; This year red team won.      
 We have all kinds of races my best is 
the relay,we also have running races,  
egg and spoon,three legged, potato and 
sack races.                            
   The infants' classes have sports on 
a different day to juniors.            
   We have proper lanes marked out on  
Frogmore. Parents come to watch, they  
sit one side of the track with the     
infants; all the juniors sit the other 
side in their teams.                   
   At the end, when the winning team is
announced, there is a lot of cheering; 
the captains of the winning team,      
(Stephen Fletcher &amp; Sarah Pitt), are   
presented with a shield.               
  Nobody likes putting all the chairs  
away at the end.                       </content>
