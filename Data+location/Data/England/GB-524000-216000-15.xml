		<content> Datchworth has a{Rural Policeman}as   
 there is no police station. The       
 nearest is the Divisional Police      
 Station in Stevenage. There has been a
 resident police constable in          
 Datchworth since the last century.The 
 present constable lives opposite the  
 Village Hall. He is classified as a   
 rural village constable. His          
 jurisdiction covers Datchworth, Bulls 
 Green and Burnham Green. His job      
 mainly involves helping and advising  
 the general public. There has been no 
 serious crime in this area only minor 
 misdemeanours.Most local police       
 administration has been computerised  
 and has aided the local constable. He 
 thinks that there will be a more      
 positive move towards better community
 policing in the future.               
 Local cases are heard in{Stevenage
