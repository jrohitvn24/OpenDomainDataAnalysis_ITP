		<content> The Upper Heyford air base dominates  
 the region. It covers the whole of the
 eastern half of the block with the    
 runway and military buildings to the  
 north and the associated housing and  
 amenities for military personnel to   
 the south.                            
                                       
 The base, although technically  under 
 the control of the Royal Air Force, is
 leased to the American armed forces   
 and is one of the principal United    
 States Air Force bases in Europe.     
 There is only one British officer on  
 the base and he acts as a liaison     
 officer between the American forces,  
 the RAF,  and the local population.Any
 problems or complaints from local     
 residents concerning American         
 personnel must first be repoted to the
 liaison officer.
