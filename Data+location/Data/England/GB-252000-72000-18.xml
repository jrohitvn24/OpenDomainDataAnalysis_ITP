		<content> In the north east corner of the block 
 there are stone rows, hut circles and 
 stone circles, evidence of early man  
 having lived in this area. Further    
 antiquities are a kist-vaen, standing 
 stones, and stone crosses. The stone  
 rows run side by side at Merrivale,   
 one being about 850 feet and the other
 600 feet long in an east-west         
 direction. The kist-vaen is close by  
 the southern row and has unfortunately
 been damaged, but it still retains    
 most of its original stone            
 construction. The biggest standing    
 stone is about 10 feet. Crosses are   
 numerous on Dartmoor and are thought  
 to be associated with ancient markers 
 for tracks such as the Abbot's Way    
 from Plympton to Tavistock.
