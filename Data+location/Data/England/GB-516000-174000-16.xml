		<title>16GUMLEY HOUSE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Built by Mr John Gumley - a famous    
 glassmaker - in about 1700.It remained
 a private house until 1841 when it was
 sold to Madame de Bonnault D'hout, the
 foundress of the Faithful Companions  
 of Jesus whose main object was the    
 education of the poor. A boarding     
 school was also set up for wealthy    
 students to subsidise the original    
 school. During the 19th century the   
 number of pupils increased to nearly  
 100. The school was recognised by the 
 Board of Education in 1922. The       
 boarding school was closed in 1939 at 
 the start of the second world war. It 
 reopened in 1945 but the number of    
 boarders decreased and it was formally
 closed in 1968. By 1959 Gumley was a  
 2-form entry grammar school. It       
 expanded to 3-form and eventually     
 4-form entry. In 1976 it became a     
 6-form entry comprehensive school.    </content>
