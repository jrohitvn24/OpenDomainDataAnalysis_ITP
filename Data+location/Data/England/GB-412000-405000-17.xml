		<title>17Tourism in Holmfirth</title>
		<content> The area around Holmfirth is becoming 
 well known as a tourist attraction.   
 People first became interested in the 
 area because of the B.B.C.Television  
 programme{'Last of the Summer Wine'   
 which was filmed in and around the    
 town. We did a{survey}in which we     
 asked tourists questions about        
 Holmfirth.64% of the people we asked  
 had visited the town because of the   
 television programme.72% of the people
 came from outside West Yorkshire.When 
 asked what they thought of Holmfirth, 
 81% of the sample said they liked it. 
 The most{popular features}were the old
 stone built houses and the narrow     
 rambling alleyways.They also liked the
 countryside and reservoirs around     
 Holmfirth.When tourists come to       
 Holmfirth they spend most of their    
 time browsing around shops.
