		<content> There are mostly fields in our area.  
 In some of the woods there are        
 different animals and birds like      
 badgers, foxes, owls, voles, squirrels
 and wood-peckers. The area looks very 
 attactive. Some fields are covered in 
 crops and some are just grass for hay 
 or grazing. There are more conifers   
 than deciduous trees. {Geology.}      
 Leintwardine stands 440 F.T above sea 
 level at the church and has a fairly  
 dry climate with an average rainfall  
 of 27.8".(The lowest rain fall        
 recorded locally was 20.4"and the     
 highest 41.99"in 1960).The beautiful  
 scenery of the district around        
 Leintwardine has had a varied         
 development. The rocks are very old,  
 about 350 million years, and they     
 formed when this part of the world was
 under the sea.
