 southern end of Bassenthwaite Lake is 
 within the Lake District National     
 Park. The River Derwent flows into the
 lake at the southern end from         
 Derwentwater its source. The A591 road
 from Keswick to Carlisle crosses the  
 area on the eastern shore and the A66 
 from Keswick to Cockermouth and       
 Workington traverses the western      
 shore. The small village of           
 Thornthwaite on the western side is   
 dominated by coniferous woodland and  
 open scree fell. The 'Bishop' a white 
 rock is a feature of the fell. On the 
 eastern shore the Calvert Trust run an
 outdoor centre for the disabled and   
 also a bird reserve on wet land near  
 the River Derwent. There are public   
 walks in the forest and access to the 
 lake. The population is engaged in    
 agriculture, forestry and tourism.    </content>
