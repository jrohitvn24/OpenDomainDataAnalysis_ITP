		<content> The villages of Barnt Green,Cofton    
 Hackett and Hopwood are situated in   
 the North Eastern part of the County  
 of Hereford and Worcester.            
 Barnt Green and Hopwood are surrounded
 by{farmland}and have{no industry      
 nearby. Farming and a few local       
 services and trades provide           
 employment for some of the people.To  
 the south of Cofton Hackett the       
 situation is similar to Barnt Green   
 and Hopwood but to the north there are
 large industries and the connurbation 
 of Birmingham.                        
 The three villlages have changed      
 little recently. There has been no    
 major house building programme for a  
 number of years.  The only change in  
 the landscape is the construction of  
 the M 42 Motorway.
