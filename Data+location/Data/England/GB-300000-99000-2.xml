		<content> beautiful countryside.We read that    
 in the original Domesday book that our
 village had land for three ploughs.In 
 lordship one and a half ploughs 3     
 slaves.Four villagers with one small  
 holder have one and a half ploughs.   
 Three acres of meadow,four hundred    
 acres of pasture, and the village was 
 worth 20 shillings!                   
                                       
 The village trail is a network of foot
 paths and roads and fields that run   
 through Clyst Hydon.It crosses the    
 river Clyst twice.There is a lot of   
 wild life along the trail.We made some
 pamphlets and sold them for 5p each.  
 There are 24 houses along the trail.  
 Two people called Dave and Jane helped
 us by going around the trail and      
 taking photos with us.
