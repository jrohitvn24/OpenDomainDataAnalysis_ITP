		<content> This area can be divided into the USAF
 Base, Woodbridge, and the larger tract
 of forest and farmland with a few     
 scattered houses. Everyone, Americans 
 and British, live under the protection
 of British Law and the British Police.
 American Security Police operate at   
 the Base, and a British policeman is  
 stationed there as a Liaison Officer. 
 A British Legal Adviser serves there  
 also. Offences arise which are common 
 to any community,such as road traffic,
 drugs and occasional rowdiness - all  
 being dealt with in British Courts. At
 times campers try to stay overnight on
 Forest land, a practice disallowed by 
 the Commission's Bye-Laws. Farmers are
 sometimes annoyed by horse-riders'    
 disregard for crops, but both Police  
 Forces recognise this area as one     
 which poses few problems of real      
 crime.                                </content>
