		<content>   About{8.20a.m.}you hear the first   
 roar of the{plane engines}starting    
 up.Usually they are the{Harrier Jump  
{Jets}which can take off vertically.   
 Sometimes a jump jet hovers over my   
 house and that is the noisiest thing  
 of all!                               
   It quietens around midday,for lunch 
 I suppose,but half an hour later the  
 engines start to scream again.        
{Helicopters}fly to and from{Portland  
{Navy Base.                            
   Around 5p.m.the last of the day-    
 flying planes come in.They are the    
 planes used as targets by ships.The   
 thing I really hate is the{night      
{flying}because then I just can't get  
 to sleep.                             
   At weekends you can see{gliders}and 
 hear the whistling sound when the tow 
 rope drops. It's very noisy living    
 near the Base but very interesting.   </content>
