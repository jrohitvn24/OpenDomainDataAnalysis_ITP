		<title>18LAND USE</title>
		<content> The{land use}in this area is mostly   
 for farmland which is sown and        
 fertilized grassland. Large tracts of 
 woodland are in evidence, much of     
 which is{coniferous}forest planted    
 during the past sixty years by the    
 Forestry Commission with a view to    
 replacing timber cut down in the First
 World War. Some woodland, however, is 
 not maintained for commercial reasons,
 and appears unmanaged. Footpaths      
 through such woodland areas provide   
 delightful leisure facilities. A large
 area of land was once used as a{race  
{course,}but horses have not raced     
 there for over a century. Nowadays its
 use is as a popular recreational      
 locality for walking. Many field gates
 to had been made by an old method of  
 using tree_trunks ,instead of using   
 metal and wooden plank .
