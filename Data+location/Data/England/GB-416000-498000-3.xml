		<title>03Trees in Catterick Garrison.</title>
		<content> We surveyed the trees in this area,   
 which is mainly woodland, and found   
 that pine trees were most dominant    
 with many of them growing in regular  
 formation. The rest of the trees were 
 randomly situated near the pines or   
 used to form boundaries or hedges.    
  There were a great many spruce, ash, 
 sycamore, hawthorn, holly and larch.  
 There were several silver birch,      
 hazel, willow, horse-chestnut, wild   
 rose, crab-apple and elderberry.      
 Of beech, elm and lime, there were    
 very few.                             
  We did not take particular note of   
 trees growing in private gardens, but 
 did note that there was quite a       
 variety, including laburnum, privet,  
 birch and poplar.
