		<title>01Down Ampney &amp; Latton</title>
		<content> This block situated on the            
 Wiltshire/Gloucestershire boarder is  
 primarily farmland, containing two    
 small villages, Down Ampney &amp; Latton. 
 The farmland is almost entirely cereal
 production, with a small livestock    
 industry.   Both villages have a mix  
 of agricultural, council &amp; private    
 houses, most villagers commute to the 
 larger towns near by for employment,  
 via, the A419 which runs diagonally   
 through the SW quarter of the block,  
 this being a single carrageway main   
 road, linking the M4 &amp; M5 motorways.  
 This dangerous road, due to the speed 
 volume and type of traffic,           
 effectively segregates the south west 
 corner of the block, distroying what  
 should be the rural character of      
 Laton.   Little remains of the disused
 airfield SE of Down Ampney, other than
 a small menorial to the Arnham landing</content>
