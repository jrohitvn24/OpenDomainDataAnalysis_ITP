		<title>01LOOKING AT OUR AREA</title>
		<content> Our area (D block) is near to         
 Newmarket. Cheveley, which is the main
 village in our block is about 3\ miles
 from the town. Newmarket is famous for
 breeding and racing thoroughbred      
 horses. In our block, there are seven 
 stud farms which breed racehorses.    
 Some are private-they only have mares 
 on, and some are public-they have     
 stallions on and they let people bring
 in their mares to mate.               
 The area is mostly flat. There are two
 churches in our block, and a lot of   
 the buildings are old and thatched and
 many are made of flint.               
 We visited 2 main farms in the area:  
 Hill and Hall Farm. The farms are     
 mainly arable: they grow crops.       
 There are quite a number of old moats 
 in the area, and there is one in our D
 block, in Upend village.
