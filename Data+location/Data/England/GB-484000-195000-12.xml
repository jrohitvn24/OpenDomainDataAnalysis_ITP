		<content>    Traditional brick and flint houses 
are in evidence in the centres of the  
villages,spaces often infilled with    
modern houses.Plastered or pebble-     
dashed pre-1939 houses,some with bay   
windows,show 20th century ribbon       
development.The modern estate houses   
depict the popular architectural trends
of their eras - wooden panels and large
picture windows giving way to Georgian 
facades as fashion has changed.        
    An interesting recent development  
in Naphill has been the use of brick   
and flint again.One of the included    
slides shows one built 2 years ago next
to another new house designed in the   
Georgian style (which incorporates a   
solar heating panel).                  
    Many of the original farms have    
been converted into expensive mews type
dwellings and Brands House is now the  
headquarters of a promotional firm.    </content>
