		<content> On Tuesday 25th June we went to the   
 Box Room.The Box Room is a little shop
 down Bond Street,it sells clothes,    
 shoes but it does not sell wellies.   
 The Box Room has been a clothes shop  
 for 14 years this August.The dearest  
 price is a jacket which is Â£16.95.The 
 Box Room opens in the morning at      
 9.30am and shuts for lunch at 1.30pm  
 and opens again at 2.30pm till 5.30pm.
 The Box Room get their clothes from   
 a wholesaler in the east end of       
 London.The lady we saw has worked     
 there for about 8 months they have two
 staff working for them.They get about 
 30 customers a day.It has mostly the  
 same customers who buy their chothes. 
 The most popular colour is pastel.The 
 Box Room sells jeans most of all.All  
 the clothes in the Box Room are in    
 fashion.Some people buy straight away 
 while others have clothes put by.     </content>
