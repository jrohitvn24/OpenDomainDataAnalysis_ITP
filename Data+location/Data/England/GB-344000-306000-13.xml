		<title>13SHOPPING IN BAYSTON HILL</title>
		<content>    The main shopping area in Bayston  
 Hill is situated in Landsdowne Road.  
 The parade has a good selection of    
 shops selling a great variety of      
 goods:_ newspapers,post office,sweets,
 D.I.Y.,chemist,Estate Agents, Bakers, 
 Wine shop, Super Market, Pet Shop,    
 Greengrocers, Hair dresses,and Chip   
 shop. There is also a general store   
 and Butchers in Overdale Road.        
   People were asked how much use they 
 made of the shops in Bayston Hill. The
 general impression is that most people
 only use them in emergencies and the  
 bulk of their shopping is done in the 
 Shrewsbury Supermarkets. Their reasons
 are because of cost. Goods in Bayston 
 Hill are considerably more expensive  
 than in Shrewsbury. House wives in    
 full time employment make more use of 
 the local shops as they find them     
 convenient and they save time.        </content>
