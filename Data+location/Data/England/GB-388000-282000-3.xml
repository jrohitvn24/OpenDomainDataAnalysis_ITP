		<content>   The Crown Centre was opened in 1985.
 In the Centre there is a large        
 supermarket called Presto,a{market}   
 hall,a new library,the Town Hall and  
 many empty shop units.The library has 
 a childrens section on the ground     
 floor and an adult section upstairs.  
 The Market Hall has been modernised   
 but keeps its old fashioned look.The  
 Town Hall was built in 1886 and the   
 red brick facade has been preserved   
 while the hall itself has been        
 rebuilt.                              
   The main shopping street is the High
 Street.Unil 1968 all{traffic}used this
 route through the town.In 1968 a{ring 
{road}was built.Now the High Street is 
 closed to traffic on Saturdays.The    
 High Street has many small shops but  
 only one department store,Owen Owen.  
 This may limit the appeal of{trade}in 
 Stourbridge.                          </content>
