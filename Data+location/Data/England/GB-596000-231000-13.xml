		<title>13BOXTED HALL TREE GROWING</title>
		<content> There are more trees and hedges on the
 farm now than for many years.Willow   
 trees are grown and the wood is used  
 to make cricket bats.The thorn hedges 
 had been for keeping the cattle in_cut
 and lay hedges_but these were being   
 replaced with field maple,ash and crab
 apple_woods that could be used as fire
 wood.                                 
   An experimental area of four acres  
 was being kept for reshearch into the 
 old mettod of pollarding oak trees.   
 This technique has been largely       
 forgotten and it is necessary to find 
 out the best age at which to start    
 polling the oaks.                     
   Another experiment on oak trees was 
 the taking off of all side branches at
 the top rather like a palm tree.The   
 tree grows much quicker and will      
 produce good,knot free timber useful  
 for making furniture.                 </content>
