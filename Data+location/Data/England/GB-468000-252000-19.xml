		<title>19A Town School visits Gayton</title>
		<content>We go to Eastfield Lower School in     
Northampton and we are all 9 years old.
We were asked to do a survey of Gayton 
for "The Domesday Project" - none of us
had ever been to Gayton and some hadn't
even been to a village before. Here are
some of the things we thought before we
visited Gayton.                        
"I think millionaires live in villages 
because they are rich."                
"There'll be a lot more nature there." 
"There won't be many shops to buy      
things in - so people will be richer." 
"It will be very quiet - because there 
won't be many cars."                   
"Everybody will be old, the houses     
will be old too."                      
"I can't wait to see the school,       
there are only 20 children in the      
school and we've got 30 in our class   
and they've got a computer all to      
themselves - it's not fair,"           </content>
