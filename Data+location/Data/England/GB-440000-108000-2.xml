		<content>    The area we surveyed was mostly for
 industrial use and some{waste land.}  
 There also was a bit of grassland that
 wasnt looked after or utilised.It     
 doesnt,look as if it could have been  
 used for grazing,cattle either.There  
 were no shops,hotels,hospitals,clubs  
 whatsoever,only a plumbing shop and a 
 machine parts shop which was in the   
{ship repair}yard in the industrial    
 area.There were quite a few depots,   
 storage houses and warehouses,used for
 storing parts for use  in the         
 ship repair yard.   As we entered into
 the industrial area we passed an army 
 railway line used for different goods 
 passing from one site to the other.   
   There was also the MacMullan        
 Barracks where there was a army guard 
 keeping watch,making sure nobody      
 entered unless permission was given.
