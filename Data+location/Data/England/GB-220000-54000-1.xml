		<content>  Our block is a rural area with one   
 small village(Pelynt)close to the     
 holiday resort of Looe.               
  The land is a plateau(300-400ft)much 
 dissected by deep river valleys.The   
 very deep valley of the W Looe        
 river,makes communication to the east 
 difficult.Apart from the B3359,all    
 roads are narrow and require passing  
 places for traffic.Hedges are of the  
 high Cornish type and support a rich  
 variety of plant species.Trees grow in
 valleys but are scarce elsewhere.     
  Older houses are stone built with    
 slate roofs,but on the newer          
 estates,houses are made with blocks   
 and have tiled roofs.Cob walls(Earth  
 and straw)were once common but none   
 now remain.The church was built in the
 15th century on the site of a previous
 Norman building.The old school and    
 school house were built in 1860.      </content>
