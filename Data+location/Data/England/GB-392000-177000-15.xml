		<title>15A Day in the Life of Lucy</title>
		<content> This is the diary account of an 8 year
 old school girl.                      
                                       
 In the morning I woke up and did all  
 the things I usually do, like getting 
 dressed, washing and having breakfast.
 At ten to nine Alison and Andrew      
 called and we went to school.         
 After school I played with Alison and 
 Clare with dolls, and we dressed up.  
 At 5 o'clock Clare and I had to go    
 home for tea.                         
 After tea I went to my ballet class   
 in Chippenham. I am in Grade 2 now, as
 I passed my last exam. I got          
 commended. My ballet lesson goes on   
 from 6.15 to 7.00 pm.                 
 I came home and had a slice of swiss  
 roll and a glass of water.            
 I played a game of Yakzee on the      
 computer before going to bed.
