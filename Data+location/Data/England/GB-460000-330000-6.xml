 I woke up and I listened to my clock  
 radio.It was 7.15am.At about half past
 seven i decided to get up I got       
 dressed.Then I went down the stairs   
 and watched the Saturday Picture      
 Show.When I heard my clock radio      
 switch I realised I had been mucking  
 about for nearly an hour.After the    
 program had finished I watched my dad 
 playing our organ.He played           
 money,money,money by ABBA, eight days 
 a week by the Beatles and he also     
 played save a prayer by Duran Duran.  
 Then I watched chip's.As always some  
 man did something wrong.In this       
 program a poor man stole a car with   
 his friend so he could get to work in 
 time but the stolen car had some money
 and a tape that the owner of the car  
 needed.At that point I switched off   
 the T.V set.                          </content>
