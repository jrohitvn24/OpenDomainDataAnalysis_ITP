		<title>0975 Years of Guiding</title>
		<content>    75 years ago in 1910,the guiding   
 movement started. Earlier,boys had    
 become Scouts,and girls had the urge  
 to enjoy similar activities. It was   
 organised by Robert Baden-Powell,later
 Lord Baden-Powell.                    
    The uniform now consists of a blue 
 shirt and skirt with a coloured scarf 
 held by a plaited leather woggle.     
    Our company is organised by an     
 adult called 'Dove'. She is helped by 
 another Guider who we call 'Acorn'.   
 The age range for Guides is 10 to 14  
 years. They can go on camps where they
 have to look after themselves and cook
 their own food. They sometimes have   
 toasted marshmallows around a campfire
 and sing songs.                       
    To celebrate the 75 years,a flame  
 was carried from London to Guide      
 companies all over the country.
