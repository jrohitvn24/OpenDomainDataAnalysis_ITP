		<content> The new village hall is extremely big.
 In the hall you can play different    
 sports like badminton, roller booting,
 football and keep fit. The caretaker  
 of the hall is Dawn Wright who keeps  
 it clean, apart from the bar and Tony 
 Wressell looks after that.There are   
{a lot of weekly events that take place
 at the hall like play school, youth   
 club, discos and dances.The{old hall  
{was knocked down about two years ago  
 and then the new started emerging.    
 Soon it was built and was opened in   
 1984 by Mick Hyde as he did alot of   
 the work and is now chairman of the   
 committee.There are alot of rooms in  
 the hall.There's the{snooker room,bar,
{kitchen,cloakrooms,seating area}and of
 course the{main hall.}Some people hold
 their wedding receptions,anniversary  
 and other parties there.It's a big    
 improvement on the old fashioned hall.</content>
