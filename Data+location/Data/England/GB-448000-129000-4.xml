		<content> The Rev.R.Teare told us that he has   
 been Rector of St.John's Church for   
 two and a half years. The church was  
 built as a pilgrim church not a       
 parish church. It is made of          
 local stone and flint. Rev.R.Teare    
 felt that God was calling him to be a 
 Priest.The area that the church serves
 is nine square miles that is mostly   
 fields.The church had a lepers gallery
 and squints for the children to look  
 through the screen.900 years ago there
 would be no glass in the windows,     
 there were just holes to let in       
 light.There were pews around the walls
 for the weak and the old.There was no 
 electricity. There would have been    
 two or three books which would        
 have been copied out by hand.The Mayor
 ,various Bishops and the Dean of      
 Winchester are important people that  
 have been here to the church.         </content>
