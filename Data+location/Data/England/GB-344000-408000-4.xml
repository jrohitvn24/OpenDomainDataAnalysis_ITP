		<title>04Wild Flowers in Lathom</title>
		<content>We think that there are probably far   
fewer wild flowers today than there    
were 50 years ago in Lathom. We think  
the wild flower population is          
decreasing because of:-                
1) Pollution from more cars.           
2) Fewer hedgerows.                    
3) Increased spraying of cropss.       
4) More picking\damaging of wild       
flowers.                               
We collected 45 different specimens of 
wild flowers round our school. Then we 
asked an older resident who knows about
wild flowers and she did not agree. She
thinks there are just as many now as 50
yrs. ago. Children now travel in cars  
so do not see them and don't know their
names. She walked 9km each day and saw 
many wild flowers. She had also made a 
list of flowers found in Lathom this   
year. We put our two lists together and
came up with more than 70 varieties.   </content>
