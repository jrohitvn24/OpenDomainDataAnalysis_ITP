		<content> Vernham Dean is an unusual village in 
 that fifty percent of the houses have 
 been built in the last fifteen years, 
 offering a rural environment for      
 people to live in a very pleasant part
 of Hampshire and commute daily to     
 their place of work. Consequently the 
 population is composed, for the       
 greater part of young families with an
 average of two children  living in    
 their own detached houses. There is a 
 small community of older retired      
 people also living in their own(      
 usually older type) houses. A small   
 estate of local authority owned       
 bungalows is provided for older       
 people. There are also a few council  
 owned semi_detached houses.
