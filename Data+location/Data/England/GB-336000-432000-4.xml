		<title>04A rural policeman</title>
		<content>     The{local police constable}has    
 been in the force for 10 years,       
 having served five years in the RAF   
 Police. He lives in the police station
 in Weeton and works his own hours.    
     His 'beat' covers a large rural   
 area. There is little crime, although 
 poaching and sheep rustling are not   
 unknown.                              
    {He wants to be looked on as a     
{friend and adviser.}Relations with the
 local people are good. They will      
 invite him in for a cup of tea and    
 ring him for advice.                  
     He likes his work and has no wish 
 to change his job.{He would have no   
{hesitation in recommending a career in
{the police force.                     
     Persistent critics of the police  
 should spend some time with them. They
 might then see things differently!
