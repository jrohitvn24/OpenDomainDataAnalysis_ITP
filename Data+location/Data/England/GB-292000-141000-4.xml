 In 1985 Timberscombe set up a Housing 
 Association with a seven member       
 committee.They plan to build 10       
 housing units in the village on a site
 already available with outline        
 planning permission.It is hoped that  
 this development will attract young   
 families to the area.The houses will  
 be for rent.The Local Athority will be
 responsible for the nomination of half
 the tenants and the Association for   
 the other half.The Association are at 
 present awaiting recognition by the   
 Housing Commission but they hope that 
 building will commence during 1986.   </content>
