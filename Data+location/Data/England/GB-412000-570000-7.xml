		<title>07A School Day,Darras Hall</title>
		<content>    "A typical day for me is to get up 
 at 7.45. Mum opens my curtains.While  
 I'm in the shower I wash really       
 quickly because I race my brother.    
                                       
 Downstairs I have some Weetabix and   
 milk.I can hear Mum saying  "Have you 
 made your bed yet?"...automatically I 
 say "YES". After breakfast I get my   
 things ready and we drive to school.  
                                       
             We spend the morning doing
 Maths,English,and Singing.I don't like
 singing at all. I might have a go on  
 the computer.Then the bell goes,I have
 a packed lunch.We have environmental  
 studies after lunch and quiet reading 
 which is my best lesson,then football.
 After football it's always a rush to  
 get dressed. I'm usually the last one 
 out of school."
