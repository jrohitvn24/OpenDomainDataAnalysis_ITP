		<title>04Bideford:S+SE.Pollution.</title>
		<content> A serious intrusion into the beauty of
the area is made by the electricity    
pylons in the south and west,and the   
private tipping on the east bank of    
the Yeo,just before it's junction with 
the Torridge.Indiscriminate tipping of 
rubbish in the river,alongside the     
lay-bys on the A386, also adds to the  
pollution of the Torridge ,which       
already has to contend with the        
untreated sewage of Bideford and North-
am,and industrial waste from up river. 
Derelict land at Kynochs,East-the-Water
creates unsightliness,although much of 
it is being screened by wild plants,and
the District Council has plans to      
improve the area ,with management of   
the adjacent saltmarsh.Heavy traffic   
at the height of the summer,builds up  
within the area,with undesirable       
effects.
