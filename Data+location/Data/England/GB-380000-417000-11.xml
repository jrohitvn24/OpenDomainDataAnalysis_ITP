		<content> These exposed moorlands are developed 
 on underlying millstone grit rocks,   
 quite unique to the{Pennines.}The     
 stone is used to make the black       
 dry-stone walls used as field         
 boundaries. Being on the windward side
 of the Pennines the area is exposed to
 wet, westerly winds and this, coupled 
 with an average altitude of 300       
 metres, results in wet, windy and cold
 conditions. The water-table is at or  
 near the surface and so feels wet and 
 marshy under-foot.                    
    The soils are very acid and support
 only moorland vegetation such as      
 heather, gorse and ling. Grass is     
 tufted are coarse broken by an        
 occasional shrub or small tree. This  
 rugged, but unspoilt, terrain is      
 popular with ramblers and             
 conservationalists alike and has a    
 beauty of its own.                    </content>
