		<title>16OLD ROSSINGTON _ FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content>    A small survey was carried out to  
 find out about family life.  We asked 
 people a variety of questions to find 
 out amongst other things _ why they   
 live in Rossington, what are the main 
 occupations, children's activities and
 shopping habits.                      
     Most people questioned were not   
 born in Rossington, but live here as  
 they like the area.  They have lived  
 here for under 15 years, owning their 
 own homes and are all professional.   
     Before school age all children    
 attended play and nursery school. As  
 they got older many children went to  
 swimming club.  The majority of women 
 shop at Gateways supermarket and      
 also the open market on Friday, some  
 shop in Doncaster. We discovered the  
 most useful thing in the home was the 
 washing machine.  The motor car was   
 the most useful machine outside.      </content>
