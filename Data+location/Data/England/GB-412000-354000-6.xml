		<content>     Parish councillors deal with small
problems such as holes in the roads,   
lighting, traffic problems and visit   
places if something is wrong.  They    
meet every six weeks when they discuss 
planning applications and also         
recommend what should be done.         
     There is a lot of committee work  
at Leek District Council level - Health
committee, Planning committee, which   
deals with home extensions, new housing
and conversions, Amenities committee   
which deals with swimming baths,       
playgrounds and sports centres, Policy 
and Resource committee which decides   
how the money is to be spent.          
     Staffordshire County Council deal 
with education, libraries and the      
fire-service in the whole county.  Our 
County Councillor is Mrs Eileen        
Critchlow.                             
     Our M.P. is Mr. David Knox.       </content>
