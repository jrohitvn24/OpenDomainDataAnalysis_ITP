 We have one public house in the       
 village the "Fisher's Arms", mine     
 hosts are Mr &amp; Mrs D. Storar, the     
 pub also doubles as a sweet shop for  
 the children of the village since the 
 closure of the Village Shop in 1984   
 which was owned and run by Mr &amp; Mrs C.
 Robertson.We are now served by Mobile 
 Vans for Butchery,Bakery,Fish,Coal    
 and Lemonade etc.                     
  In the mid_seventies we had our own  
 petrol pump serviced by Mr R. Simpson 
 who was also the village Blacksmith,  
 although the petrol dried up long ago 
 and Mr Simpson is retired, the Smithy 
 still works as well as ever,whenever  
 it is needed.                         
  The old Horncliffe Mill is now       
 converted into a pig farm.
