The area which we surveyed is rural and
mostly agricultural, and contains two  
villages, the larger of which is       
Freeland, and the smaller Church       
Hanborough. There is also a tiny hamlet
called Barnard Gate in the SW corner of
our area.  Our school is in Eynsham, to
the south, and to carry out our survey 
we had to cross the A40 trunk road     
which forms the southern boundary of   
the area. This is a busy main road     
which forms the route from London and  
Oxford to the Cotswolds and North      
Wales.                                 
                                       
Many people living here work in Oxford 
and Witney, or on local farms. We      
decided to find out about the lives of 
children of our own age, and about the 
institutions and some of the work that 
people do, especially on the land.     </content>
