		<title>18MOTORWAY SURVEY-M1 40/41</title>
		<content> On July 4th we did a motorway         
 survey.We were split up into 6 groups 
 of 3.Every group took a lane of the   
 motorway.Our results are as follows:  
 Northbound_211 cars and 106 lorries.  
 Southbound_159 cars and 97 lorries.   
 This was all done from 10,o clock to  
 ten past 10 i.e.10 minutes.           
 CONCLUSIONS                           
 1.Northbound on the M1 has more       
 traffic because it is nearer to Leeds 
 and the M62.                          
 2.There are twice as many cars and    
 lorries going towards North.          
 3.There are 1.6 times as many cars    
 than lorries going towards South.
