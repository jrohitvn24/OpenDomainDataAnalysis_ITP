		<content>  Bulford camp was built on the first  
 750 acres of Salisbury Plain purchased
 by the army in 1897.It was bought     
 because the chalk land was ideal for  
 training the Cavalry and Yeomanry.The 
 original hutted camp was built in 1900
 on the site of the present Sling      
 Barracks.The railway extension linked 
 Bulford Camp to Amesbury in 1906.     
  Today there are six barracks, Sling, 
 Ward, Gordon,Wing,Picton and Kiwi.The 
 camp houses 3,000 Officers and Men.   
 There is a Parachute, an Infantry and 
 a Logistics Support Regiment. There is
 also a Gunner Battery,and a Field     
 Ambulance Service.There are a number  
 of small units collectively known as  
 BATAU of which one is a transport RCT 
 and the Military Police have a
