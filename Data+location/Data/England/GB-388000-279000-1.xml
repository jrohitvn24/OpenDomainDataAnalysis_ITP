		<title>01THE IRON AGE HILL FORT</title>
		<content>    Although arrow heads and flint     
 scrapers dating back to 3500BC had    
 been found in the area,there is no    
 concrete evidence pointing to a       
 significant settlement in the vicinity
 of Hagley before the{Iron Age.}The    
 local fort on{Wychbury Hill}was       
 probably constructed by the{Iron Age  
 'B' peoples,who first penetrated the  
 Bristol Channel in approximately 150  
 BC.                                   
    Of the two tribes occupying the    
 Severn Valley in this period, it is   
 most likely that the{Cornovii}lived at
{Wychbury.}Although the western edge of
 Hagley is skirted by a{Roman road     
 linking Droitwich to Greensforge,the  
 sophisticated{Cornovii}social system  
 would have remained virtually intact  
 until the late 6th and early 7th      
 century Saxon invasions.
