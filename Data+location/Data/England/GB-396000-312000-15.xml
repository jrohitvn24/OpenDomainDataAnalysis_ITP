		<content>There are no theatres,opera houses or  
or cinemas in Hednesford.To enjoy such 
entertainments people in Hednesford    
have to travel to the surrounding      
towns.The Prince of Wales Hall in      
Cannock, the Grand in Wolverhampton    
and the Gatehouse in Stafford.There is 
a local cinema at Cannock and others   
at Walsall,Wolverhamton,Rugeley and    
Stafford.Few people visit the theatre  
or cinema regularly as it is expensive 
and quite difficult to get there.Visits
are usually reserved for birthdays or  
Christmas. Most people hire a video    
film instead. Dances are held often at 
the social clubs,the Aquarius Ballroom 
and Anglesey Pub. Many clubs and pubs  
provide food, snooker, darts, music and
bingo and are the main source of local 
entertainment. Going out for a meal    
with friends to the club or pub is a   
very popular activity.                 </content>
