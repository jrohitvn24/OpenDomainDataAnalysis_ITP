		<title>09Sandwich Railway Station</title>
		<content>Until recently,Sandwich Railway Station
has had the appearance of an old coal  
shed with dirty waiting rooms and its  
window frames falling apart.Weeds grew 
on the line and the bridge across the  
line was rusty.                        
However,a miraculous change has taken  
place,mainly for safety reasons but    
also for appearance and efficiency.The 
wooden manual gates have been replaced 
by automatic barriers and closed       
circuit cameras monitoring pedestrian  
movement.                              
The waiting rooms have been renovated  
and have had a new coat of paint,the   
weeds have been uprooted and the bridge
has been completely repaired.          
Although other Railway Stations are    
more important,British Rail has spent  
{100,000 on a face-lift for the 1985   
114th British Open Golf Tournament to  
welcome spectators arriving by train.  </content>
