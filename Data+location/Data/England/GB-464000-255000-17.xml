		<title>17Changing Times in Bugbrooke</title>
		<content>We asked some older people what it was 
like in 1945.                          
 There were 3 shops-2 grocers and a    
butchers.You couldn't buy what you     
wanted because of rationing.This also  
meant that clothes,which were hard to  
get anyway,had to last longer.         
 There were no air-raid shelters and   
the only raid was by the wharf.Windows 
were blacked out every night.          
 Cars were mainly owned by businesses  
and none of the new estates were built 
so Bugbrooke was very much smaller.    
 There were two pubs as now.           
 The mill which had been standing for  
hundreds of years was burnt down which 
is why all the buildings are modern.   
(There were 2 mills on the site in     
1085.)                                 
 There has never been a railway station
or a market.
