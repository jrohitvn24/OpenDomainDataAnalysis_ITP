		<content>   I am a self-employed nurseryman     
 specialising in bedding and pot       
 plants.The business has been developed
 over the last 12 years,I am the only  
 full-time worker but employ casual    
 labour in the Spring for pricking out 
 and potting on.The work is seasonal,  
 starting in February with Primroses &amp; 
 Polyanthus, sowing seeds, filling     
 trays and pots, then pricking out of  
 seedlings, along with general care.   
 The majority of plants are sold       
 wholesale to garden centres,local     
 shops and Birmingham Wholesale        
 Market.Retail sales are also          
 increasing annually.The job is labour 
 intensive with few mechanical aids -  
 watering is done by hand as it is far 
 more accurate than by an irrigation   
 line.Heating used is bottled Propane  
 Gas and Premium Paraffin.
