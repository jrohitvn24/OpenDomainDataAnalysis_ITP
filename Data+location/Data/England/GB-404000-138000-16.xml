   {Berwick St.James Pre-school        
{Playgroup}was re-started three years  
 ago for twelve children under the age 
 of five.                              
    We meet three mornings a week from 
 nine-thirty to twelve. Children who   
 are three years old and over come     
 every day by themselves but the little
 ones bring Mum too as we are not      
 insured for younger children.         
    We are bound by many rules and     
 regulations and have to be inspected  
 by the Fire Brigade. The Social       
 Services keep in touch and the        
 Playgroup Association gives helpful   
 advice.                               
    The purpose of a playgroup is to   
 help a child to learn through         
 play.Children learn to share and to   
 mix with other children and adults.
