		<content> grit and 20% loam.They told us about  
 a year in their life and this is it.  
     In{January,}one of the slowest    
 months,they order seeds and draw up a 
 seed plan.They grow about 30 different
 kinds of plants.They begin to plant   
 and clear up after Christmas.         
     In{February}more seeds are sown   
 and extra people are needed to prick  
 out the little plants.Primroses are   
 ready to be sold in pots.             
    {March}brings Mother's Day and a   
 very busy time combined with more     
 sowing and pricking out.              
    {April}sees a pot plant rush with  
 Easter coming and the tougher bedding 
 plants are ready to go.               
    {May}is probably the busiest month 
 with selling at a fast rate,the lorry 
 and van they own going off to{Reading}
 and{Oxford.}
