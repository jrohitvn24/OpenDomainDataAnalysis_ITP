 leisure time in lots of different     
 ways. Some of the most popular        
 activities are football,swimming,     
 reading and pub and club-going.Some of
 the girls go to brownies or guides in 
 the village and some of the boys go to
 cubs or scouts,although there is not  
 an organisation in the village at     
 present.  Some of the older boys and  
 girls go to a recently started youth  
 club where there are games such as    
 table tennis, darts,pool and a tuck
