		<title>17Milk and Beef Production</title>
		<content> E.E.C. Regulations limiting the milk  
 quota has led to some diversification 
 and more farms are now mainly arable  
 with some beef and sheep. The two main
 dairy herds are at Nevill Holt and    
 Drayton. Modern electric milking      
 parlours mean that the milk is        
 collected quickly and cleanly. Beef   
 cattle are bought in for fattening on 
 the rich pastures during the          
 summer.Sheep are bred mainly for the  
 lamb trade although the wool is sold  
  to firms at Market Harborough.       
 Examples of market prices -           
 Steers:light 92.0p.,medium to         
 101.0p.,heavy to 107.0p.              
 Lambs; light to 138.5p//kg. standard  
 to 160.0p/kg.heavy to 144.3p/kg.      
 There are some smallholdings running  
 some cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs   
 plus producing free range eggs. .
