		<title>05ARABLE FARMING IN BANKS</title>
		<content>WE WENT ON A VISIT TO OLD HOLLOW FARM  
WHICH IS A 300 ACRE ARABLE FARM IN     
BANKS.THE OWNER GROWS BARLEY,BEETROOT, 
CAULIFLOWERS,CABBAGES AND SPROUTS. IT  
WAS CALLED OLD HOLLOW AFTER A LARGE    
GUTTER WHICH WAS NATURAL AND 5 METRES  
DEEP.  THE SOIL IS SILTLAND AND VERY   
FERTILE. ABOUT 20 MEN AND 10 WOMEN     
WORK THERE.THE PRODUCE IS TAKEN BY LO  
RRIES TO NEARBY WHOLESALE MARKETS.     
 THE OWNER HAS COVERTS AND A SMALL     
LAKE FOR WILD GEESE AND DUCKS. HE IS   
VERY INTERESTED IN THE CONSERVATION OF 
NATURE AND WILDLIFE.PART OF THE LAND   
IS UNDER THE NATURE CONSERVANCY        
COUNCIL.                               
 THE FARMER USES MODERN FARMING METHODS
BUT IS ALERT TO THE NEEDS OF WILDLIFE. 
 MOST OF THE ARABLE FARMS IN THE AREA  
ARE SMALLER,BEING ABOUT 50 TO 80 ACRES.
MARKET GARDENS ARE SMALLER STILL DUE TO
THE INTENSIVE NATURE OF THIS FARMING.  </content>
