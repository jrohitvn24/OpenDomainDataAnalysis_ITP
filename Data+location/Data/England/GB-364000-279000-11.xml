		<title>11FARLOW PTA SHOW</title>
		<content>  Farlow PTA Show, in the second week  
 in August, is the school's main fund  
 raising event. It is held at Farlow &amp; 
 Oreton Village Hall.                  
  Characteristically the main hall is  
 set aside for a magnificent display of
 the entries in the 70 show sections,  
 such as flowers, fruit, cakes, home   
 made wines, handicrafts and children's
 work. On entering the hall , with over
 300 precious exhibits laid out on     
 trestles, one is delighted by the     
 sweet, varied smells and the lovely   
 shapes, textures and colours of the   
 fruits of many hours' work including  
 the art of flower arranging.          
  In the two adjoining fields are tents
 for refreshments, stalls and          
 sideshows. In the open one can play   
 skittles, darts and tombola or try the
 coconut shy. Children's favourites are
 the BMX course and the pony rides.    </content>
