		<title>06SMALL BUSINESSES</title>
		<content> Witheridge has quite a few small      
 businesses.There are four builders ,  
 each employing some workers , three   
 electricians , also employing others ,
 a tree feller who supplies logs and an
 agricultural engineer,formerly a      
 blacksmith.A local artist makes hand  
 printed christmas cards which are sold
 all over England.There is one small   
 factory employing about eight workers.
 Here they make wedding dresses and    
 these are sold  as far off as Scotland
 and Ireland.They also make soft       
 toys.These small businesses,together  
 with the local shops provide few over 
 fiftypeople.This is very different to 
 forty years ago when many local men   
 worked on the farms.Nowadays, hardly  
 anyone frm the village works full time
 on a farm,although a number do some   
 part - time work.
