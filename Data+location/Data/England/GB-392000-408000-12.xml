		<title>12STREET GAMES</title>
		<content> It is the custom in this part of the  
 north of England for children to play 
 'out'.One child will call at the home 
 of another to ask if he or she is     
 coming to play outside.They will then 
 call for more children until enough   
 have been gathered to play a street   
 game.                                 
 Many street games are based on the    
 game of 'Tig' and this,in its original
 form,is still played.Children         
 have,however,made many of their own   
 variations.Another favourite is 'Hide 
 and Seek'.Once again,many changes have
 been made to make it a more           
 challenging game.                     
 In some games,the whole width of a    
 quiet street is used as the playing   
 area.The object of these games is     
 usually to get from one side of the   
 street to the other,without being     
 caught by the person who is 'on'.     </content>
