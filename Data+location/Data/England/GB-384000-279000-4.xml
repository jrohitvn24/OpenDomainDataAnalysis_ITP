    The main source of industry is the 
 steel works. This is situated by the  
 canal. Originally it received its raw 
 materials , and removed the finished  
 product by this means of transport.   
 However, the waterway has long since  
 been superceeded by the road system.  
   Unfortunately the narrow road       
 through the village, connecting with  
 the main{Wolverhampton}road is not    
 really suitable for articulated       
 vehicles carrying heavy iron products.
   The original iron works, which      
 process 'raw' iron, moved to the      
 Stourbridge area and the Steel        
 Stampings factory now only produces   
 cold stampings,mainly tractor wheels.
