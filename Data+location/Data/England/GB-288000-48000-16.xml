		<title>16Gunfield Hotel,Castle Rd.</title>
		<content> The house was built in 1837,perhaps by
 French prisoners of war.There's still 
 a cannon left on One Gun Point,and    
 there is a great view of Kingswear,the
 mouth of the river and Dartmouth.If   
 you go down a path,there is a little  
 beach with soggy sand and a small     
 stone hut for changing into swimming  
 gear.Below the garden there is a new  
 pontoon for mooring boats and a patio 
 for barbecues.The owners bought the   
 hotel 4 years ago and have done a lot 
 of work on the building and grounds.  
 There are 9 double bedrooms and 1     
 single,a dining-room with 9 tables and
 36 chairs,2 bars,and a big lounge.It  
 is a small friendly hotel and many of 
 the guests are regulars who come for  
 swimming,sailing,water-ski-ing,fishing
 the scenery and to relax.There are 12 
 staff,a chef&amp;helper,washer-upper,iron-
 maiden,4 chamber-maids &amp; 4 waitresses.</content>
