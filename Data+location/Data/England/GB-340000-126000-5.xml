		<title>05SHOPS IN LANGPORT</title>
		<content>   Most of the shops in Langport are in
 the main street but 11 are in the     
 adjacent car park. The position is    
 important for trade as the street is  
 narrow and used by heavy traffic.     
   The range of shops has improved     
 recently although there is some doubt 
 among locals as to the need for       
 services such as travel and estate    
 agents.                               
   Customers tend to use the shops in  
 Langport if they only need a few      
 items.For weekly or monthly shopping  
 trips many people  go to the larger   
 towns and make it a family outing.    
   The majority of shops are open from 
 9-5.30 (except newsagents, who work   
 longer hours) although some close     
 early on Wednesdays and Saturdays.Only
 one or two are open on Sundays.       
 Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays are  
 the busiest days for the traders.     </content>
