Children's Homes&lt;br />&lt;br />Year 6 Of Harbury School were asked about the type of house they lived in.  52% lived in semi-detached properties, with 35% living in detached houses. Two children lived in bungalows, two in terraces and one even lived in a windmill!  This is the one in the middle of the village converted into a house some years ago.&lt;br />&lt;br />42% had three bedrooms, and the same percentage had four bedrooms.  Only 2 children lived in two-bedroomed accommodation whilst four luxuriated in five-bed properties.&lt;br />&lt;br />Four houses only had one bathroom, whilst two boasted four bathrooms. Fifteen houses (48%) two bathrooms, and ten (32%) had 3 bathrooms.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
