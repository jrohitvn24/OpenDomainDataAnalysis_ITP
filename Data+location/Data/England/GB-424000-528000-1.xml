		<content> Coundon Leeholme and Leasingthorne are
 villages in COUNTY DURHAM situated    
 near the town of BISHOP AUCKLAND.     
}Most of the surrounding area is now   
 farmland with a few small plantations.
                                       
 However there is ample evidence of a  
 former industrial past where the      
 remains of quarries and coal mines    
 scar the countryside. Most of these   
 are now derelict, but a few have been 
 adapted for use by small industries.  
                                       
 The area has one claim to fame from   
 the past. WINDLESTON HALL was the     
 birthplace (on June 12 1897) of       
 ANTHONY EDEN a former prime minister. 
                                       
 Today the only famous residents are   
 racehorses which are trained at the   
 village of Leasingthorne.
