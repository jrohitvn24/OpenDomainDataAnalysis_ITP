The present owner of the shop has been 
in the village for twelve years.She    
enjoyes her job because she meets lots 
of people but she dislikes working on  
Sundays,people who know it all and the 
dust off the newspapers.Her shop is    
important to the village because it    
provides a service in delivering       
newspapers which would otherwise be    
unavailable.This shop sells            
refreshments,newspapers,comics,and     
provides a meeting place for many      
people.
