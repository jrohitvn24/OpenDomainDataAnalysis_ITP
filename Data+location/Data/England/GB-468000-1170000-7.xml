		<title>07HOUSING IN SKERRIES 1985</title>
		<content> The houses in Skerries are very spread
 out although most of them are in the  
 central belt of the island. There are 
 twenty-nine inhabited houses. Of      
 those, seventeen are old, small and   
 stone built, mainly extended{croft    
{houses.}Of the rest, three were built 
 around twenty years ago and four were 
 built within the last few years. There
 are four{council houses.              
                                       
   All the houses on the island have   
 the{Hydro-electricity}installed and   
 they also have washing machines,      
 tumble driers and lots of other{mod   
{cons.}The older people never even had 
 these things until a few years ago and
 most of the younger people take them  
 for granted because they have always  
 had them.
