		<content>   The Wem sewage works is just by the 
 station. It takes 2 men to run it.    
 They wear a water proof jacket and    
 trousers, wellingtons, safety hats and
 safety equipment.Everything goes down 
 to the sewage works for treatment. The
 solid material is taken to Shrewsbury 
 but the liquid is filtered and run    
 into the River Roden. They sometimes  
 recover odd things like false teeth   
 and return them to their owners.      
   The present rubbish tip is at the   
 S.E. corner of the area. It is        
 about 5 acres in size. The dustmen    
 work for N. Shropshire Council and    
 collect 21,794 dustbins from shops,   
 houses,garages and pubs in that area  
 every week. The 9 lorries are based at
 Shawbury. The present tipwill only    
 last to the end of this year. Then all
 the rubbish will have to go 5 miles   
 away to a new tip at Prees.           </content>
