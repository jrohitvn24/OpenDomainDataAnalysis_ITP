		<title>11A FARMER'S LIFE.</title>
		<content> The farmer has 80 fresian cows,one    
 bull and one jersey cow on 150 acres  
 of land.He uses his land for grazing, 
 hay and silage making.He has a wife   
 and two children. Two dogs help him   
 round up the cows. He starts milking  
 at 6.45 a.m. and a tanker collects the
 milk at 8.00 a.m. Then it is time for 
 breakfast. During the summer months   
 there is hay and silage making to do  
 depending on the weather. In winter   
 the cows are kept inside and the shed 
 has to cleaned out twice a day. In the
 afternoon the cows are milked again.  
 Some of the calves are kept so that   
 when the cows grow too old to produce 
 good milk they can be replaced .      
 The farmer's wife has to help bring in
 the cows, scrub the milking unit, do  
 the housework, shopping and any other 
 jobs that need to be done. The        
 children also help where needed.      </content>
