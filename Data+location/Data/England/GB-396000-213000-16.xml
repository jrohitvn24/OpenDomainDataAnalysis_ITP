		<title>16THE CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Giles Berkeley died in 1295.He was    
 buried at his own request in Little   
 Malvern but his heart was buried in   
 the church at Coberley.Heart burials  
 are very rare it is the only one in   
 the Cotswolds and it still exists.    
 Giles' favourite charger,Lombard,lies 
 buried in a low mound out side the    
 church.The site is marked with a small
 stone.Inside the church there is the  
 tomb of Dick Wittingtons mother,it is 
 an effigy tomb with a statue of her on
 it.Dick's mother was married to Sir   
 Thomas Berkeley of Coberley Hall near 
 the church and tradition has it that  
 Dick started on his travels from here.
 The original structure was Norman,it  
 replaced a Saxon cross.Unfortunately  
 the people of Coberley did not look   
 after the church so it fell down.It   
 was re-built in 1870.There is very    
 little of the Norman church left just </content>
