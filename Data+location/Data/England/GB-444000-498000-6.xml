		<content> Osmotherley{Youth Hostel}lies in a    
 glacial over-flow valley (GR 462981)  
 and was once a linen mill. It was     
 modernised 5 years ago and the present
 wardens, Mr &amp; Mrs Jones have been     
 there for 3 years. They enjoy their   
 work in the country-side because Mr   
 Jones used to work in a factory. They 
 get up at 6.30 am and work until      
 midnight. The hostel has about 6000   
 visitors a year. There are 11 bedrooms
 which can accommodate up to 82 people.
 Half are self catering but everyone   
 helps by washing up and making beds.  
 Most are walkers who stay for 1 or 2  
 nights. The hostel is closed in Dec.  
 and Jan.Nearby is the{Caravan Site}run
 by another Mr&amp;Mrs Jones.There are 18  
 static caravans and room for 57       
 touring vans,also 20 tents.Toilets and
 showers are on the site but no shop.It
 is open from April to October.        </content>
