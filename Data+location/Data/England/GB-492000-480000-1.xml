		<title>01GENERAL OVERVIEW OF BLOCK</title>
		<content> The block lies just on the southern   
 edge of the limestone {Tabular}hills  
 and extends into the {Vale of         
{Pickering.}It includes the village of{
{Brompton}and part of the village of{  
{Snainton.                             
           The alluvial plain of the   
 Vale is fertile agricultural land and 
 the lower slopes of the hills afford  
 good sheep grazing.                   
     Both villages are ancient         
 settlements on the fault line which   
 produced a reliable source of fresh   
 spring water.                         
       Farming is the predominate land 
 use. A lot of residents work in{      
{Scarborough,}and both villages have   
 a relatively high proportion of       
 retired people living there.          
 In summer holiday makers pass through 
 on the way to Scarborough, and quite a
 few people visit our villages.        </content>
