		<title>13WHIT PROCESSIONS</title>
		<content>     The first Whit procession took    
 place in Mossley in 1826. Since then  
 the tradition has been maintained with
 all the parishes of every denomination
 taking part on Whit Friday each year. 
     Those who take part meet in the   
 morning, on the market square where   
 hymns are sung before moving off.A    
 United procession is formed with each 
 church being led by its own banner    
 and band (usually a Brass Band).After 
 walking along Stockport Road the      
 procession turns along Carr Hill Road 
 before descending Mill Lane to        
 Manchester Road. The various parishes 
 split up in Bottom Mossley with St.   
 Josephs,St.Johns and St.Georges       
 continuing up Stamford Road to return 
 to Top Mossley.                       
      In the afternoon the churches    
 hold their own activities with        
 music provided by a Brass Band.       </content>
