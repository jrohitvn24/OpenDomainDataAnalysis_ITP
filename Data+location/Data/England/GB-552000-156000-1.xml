		<title>01N.Sevenoaks, Seal &amp; Kemsing</title>
		<content>This is a residential area on the north
edge of Sevenoaks merging into farmland
and woodland.                          
The 19th.C.{Bat and Ball} station is so
called because the former industry,    
manufacturing cricket bats and balls   
attracted commuters to the area.       
{Seal} is an old picturesque village on
the old Saxon road (now A25) from      
Winchester to Maidstone.               
{Kemsing} is a typical Downland        
Pilgrim's Way village with a church and
well of interest. There is a Youth     
Hostel there.                          
There are many former gravel pits now  
filled with water and used in a variety
of ways - Nature Reserve, Water sports 
and park.                              
There is a small modern industrial     
estate, supporting light industry.
