		<content> On Sundays I get up at 9.00 for church
 at 9.30. Then I have a small breakfast
 of a bowl of cereal, then we go to    
 church.                               
{Oh bliss get up at 10.00 and have a   
{late breakfast, then slowly get ready 
{for the day. Dad disappears           
{upstairs, Mum reads, I play.          
 After church I change. Dad also gets  
 ready and then he disappears into the 
 garden.                               
{Upstairs Dad paints away happily.     
{Sometimes I go swimming if it's really
{hot.                                  
 Mum gets the lunch ready and at 1.00  
 we have the roast dinner. I play      
 around and read. Then Mum and Dad     
 start gardening.                      
{We have a Sunday dinner at 1.00_2.00. 
{In the evening I sometimes play tennis
{with Dad in the summer if I'm fit     
{enough. }                             </content>
