		<title>10Future Employment in Newent</title>
		<content>  The latest unemployment figures for  
 the Newent area is 180. Two major     
 attempts are being made to resolve    
 this situation.                       
  In the first the local M.P. Mr. Paul 
 Marland has been approached by the    
 Town Council to ask the Department of 
 the Environment to provide a part-time
{Jobcentre}in Newent. This has met with
 partial success and the directors of  
 the Good News Centre in the High      
 Street have allowed a display of job  
 vacacies.                             
  Secondly there should be{light       
{industrial development}in the area    
 bearing in mind that this is the      
 centre of population for the district 
 and there is easy access to the M50   
 motorway. At present Newent is not    
 included in the latest rural          
 development plan by the Forest of Dean
 District Council but there is hope.   </content>
