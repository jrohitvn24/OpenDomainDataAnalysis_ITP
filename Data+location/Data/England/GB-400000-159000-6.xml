		<title>06THE BREWERY AT DEVIZES.</title>
		<content> The Northgate Brewery in Devizes was  
 built in 1885 by Henry Alfred Wadworth
 and has an impressive Victorian       
 facade.The Wadworth Company now       
 distribute their beers as far afield  
 as Wales,The Midlands,London and the  
 South West.                           
 Wadworth's magnificent shire horses   
 are a familiar sight delivering their 
 daily consignment of traditional beer 
 to the twenty or so pubs within a two 
 and a half mile radius of the Brewery.
 However for supplies further afield,a 
 fleet of modern lorries,which are     
 still referred to as drays,are used.  
 Wadworth's have always been closely   
 involved with the community and the   
 Company sponsors a wide range of      
 events,many of which involve well     
 known personalities.Some of Wadworth's
 better known brews are Farmers Glory, 
 introduced in 1984,and the older 6X.  </content>
