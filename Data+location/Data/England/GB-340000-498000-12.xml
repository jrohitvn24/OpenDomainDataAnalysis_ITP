		<title>12Tourism - Festival</title>
		<content> The Lake Windermere Festival is a     
 week-long series of events held early 
 in July, partly to help attract       
 visitors to the area. The Festival is 
 somewhat controversial, residents     
 describing it as a noisy nuisance and 
 organisers complaining that locals do 
 not give it enough support.           
 The range of events in the programme  
 is very wide and this year included   
 an opening parade led by the Dagenham 
 Girl Pipers, beauty competition (one  
 of the judges being a blind man),     
 celebrity football match, cookery     
 competition, marathon disco, a top    
 cycling Grand Prix, veteran and       
 vintage car fun run, fell pony show   
 (including 17th. century bare-back    
 trotting racing), decorated raft race,
 power boat racing and a running/      
 swimming/cycling triathlon.
