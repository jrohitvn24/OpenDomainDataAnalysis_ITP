		<title>17BYPASS:KILDWICK ROUNDABOUT</title>
		<content>   In 1975 it was decided that an 11   
 mile long bypass was needed in the    
 Aire Valley to relieve the existing   
 roads of heavy traffic. The new road  
 would reduce accidents on the narrow  
 Kildwick Bridge and also noise levels 
 in the local villages.                
   The main objection locally was of   
 the proposed roundabout at Kildwick to
 link the villages with the road. The  
 inhabitants complained that traffic   
 flows in Crosshills would increase due
 to the roundabout and therefore       
 pedestrians' lives would be           
 endangered.                           
   An inquiry was held in 1980 to      
 investigate the problems but it was   
 decided that the roundabout would     
 still be built. It was stated that    
 construction would start in 1983 but  
 in 1985 this has yet to happen.
