		<content> Melissa tells us what she enjoys doing
 in her spare time.                    
 "My dad, my sister and me go bowling  
 every Sunday morning at ten o'clock.  
 We play on a bowling green which is a 
 very flat piece of short grass.  You  
 have a small heavy bowl called a Jack 
 and three bigger bowls which are much 
 heavier than the Jack.  You pick up   
 the Jack and roll it along the green. 
 Then you pick up one of the larger    
 bowls.  There is a small round disc on
 the bowl and if you put your little   
 finger on the disc you shout 'finger',
 or if you put your thumb on the disc  
 you shout 'thumb'.  You have to try to
 get the bowl near to the Jack.  Then  
 your partner rolls his bowls and tries
 to get near to the Jack.  The nearest 
 bowl to the Jack wins and that person 
 gets 1 point.  The winner is the lst  
 person to get twenty points.          </content>
