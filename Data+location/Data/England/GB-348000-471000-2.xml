    Warton, or "weard-tun",means "town 
by the lookout". The older homesteads  
retain the pattern of a mediaeval      
borough which only in modern times has 
regained its size,but not its prestige,
from the sackings by the Scots and the 
Black Death in the 14th century.       
    Over 86% of homes are 20th century,
65% built since World War II. Of around
1000 homes in the electoral ward almost
600 are in the village. Unease at rapid
growth in the 1950's has given way to a
well-knit community.                   
    School and Church have both unified
through the young but a large elderly  
element contribute greatly to a growing
number of thriving organisations and   
groups. A newish Village Society seeks 
to conserve the heritage and to protect
it from alien influences.
