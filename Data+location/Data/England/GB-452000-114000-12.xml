		<title>12CONTRASTING LAND USES (2)</title>
		<content> The two contrasting side of "Park Lug"
 described on page 11 are explained    
 simply by the two  different systems  
 in use by the farmers. The land on    
 the East side is farmed by  small,    
 local farmers whose families have long
 farmed in the area. They represent the
 traditional type of farming. On the   
 west side of the Lug is a large farm  
 which is operated on a large          
 commercial scale with at least one    
 other farm outside the area. It is    
 managed not by a farmer but by a farm 
 manager. The farming system is        
 intensive and hedgerows and woodland  
 are not economical in such a system.  
 Livestock farming can be relaetively  
 economically with small fields. This  
 is not so for arable farms.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
