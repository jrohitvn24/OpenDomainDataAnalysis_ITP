		<content> There are quite a lot of places where 
 you can do sports around Helmshore.   
 You can go to the{Sports Centre}where 
 you can do almost every sport and     
 afterwards you can go to the bar      
 upstairs and have a drink, or watch   
 television. There is also the swimming
 baths. It is quite cheap to get in and
 if you want you can just watch. You   
 can also have swimming lessons. You   
 can go to the cricket club  where you 
 can  practice, play cricket or just   
 sit and watch. You can go horse riding
 as well. There is Rossendale golf     
 course where you can have coaching or 
 just have a game of golf.
