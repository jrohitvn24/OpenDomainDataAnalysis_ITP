		<content> The main line railway station at St.  
 Austell was built in 1886 by the Great
 Western Railway. In 1985 twelve people
 are employed there, seven in the      
 Travel Centre and five on other       
 duties.                               
 For most of the year there are 15     
 passenger trains a day in each        
 direction through St.Austell, but in  
 the summer this rises to 2O, when     
 passenger traffic between Penzance    
 and Plymouth increases by 5O% due     
 mainly to the influx of holiday       
 makers. The principal train service   
 from St.Austell is via Plymouth and   
 Taunton to London and there are       
 through trains to Liverpool, Newcastle
 and Aberdeen and,on Saturdays, to     
 Brighton. The station opens from 3.3O 
 a.m. until 11p.m. The earliest trains 
 carry the overnight parcels, Royal    
 Mail and newspapers.                  </content>
