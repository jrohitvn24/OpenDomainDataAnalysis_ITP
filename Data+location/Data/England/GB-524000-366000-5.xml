		<title>05Thornton Lodge Farm</title>
		<content> Thornton Lodge Farm is by the old     
 canal and near to the old railway     
 line. It is a very historical building
 or lodge with lots of rooms. Part of  
 the Viking Way runs through the land  
 and by the farm there is a nature walk
 called Spa Trail Thornton Lodge.The   
 farm has 500 acres and in the paddock 
 is a tower that is the remains of an  
 ancient water system fed from a nearby
 well via a windpump and gravity.      
 Thornton Lodge Farm is close to       
 Thornton village and Garden Farm,     
 which owns a herd of sheep. Thornton  
 village has a phone box, post box and 
 a church. Horncastle canal runs       
 through the area but is now disused.
