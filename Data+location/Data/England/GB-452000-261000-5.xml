		<content>Now the houses are so expensive. It is 
only families who are moving into the  
village who can afford to buy them.    
There are no homes for those with young
children or those people getting       
married. Many young Staverton people   
have had to move to Daventry to live.  
                                       
To sum up, Staverton seems a very quiet
sleepy place, with not much going      
on.Nearlyall the people work outside   
the village and they go for their      
entertainment elsewhere. Staverton is a
village with an ageing population. One 
of the main points is that Staverton is
so near to Daventry that people can go 
to town for all their needs and do not 
require much from the village except   
their house. Even the church is very   
quiet with no real organisation.
