		<title>07Lyford Village</title>
		<content>The small village of Lyford lies in    
an area of arable flatland, and is     
served by only 2 minor roads. Approx.  
50-60 people live in and around Lyford,
and there are about 20 dwellings of    
quite differing sizes. There are some  
Almshouses which were endowed by Oliver
Ashcombe (one-time owner of            
considerable estates) who died in 1611.
These homes, of which there were       
originally ten form a picturesque      
quadrangle. The living accommodation   
was recently brought up-to-date, and   
now, as Alms Court, there are 5        
cottages administered by a Trust and   
let at nominal rents to elderly        
persons. There are 2 manor houses:     
Manor Farm which is adjacent to the    
church, and Lyford Grange. There is    
also the small chapel of St. Mary the  
Virgin.
