		<content> In the original{Domesday Book}the     
 manorial rights were held by Ernald   
 under Hugo de Grantmesnil, one of King
 William's lieutenants. The estate     
 passed to his son Ivo and then to the 
 Count of Mewlan, later Earl of        
 Leicester who held the land for the   
 King. In 1235 the land was held by    
 Henry de Hastings as tenant for the   
 Earl of Arundel. Subsequent marriages 
 gave the chief tenancy to the Earl of 
 Chester with the land actually in the 
 hands of William de Harcourt who had  
 married Hasting's sister. The Manor   
 remained in the Harcourt family until 
 1365; a present from Hastings, who    
 retained other land in the area. The  
 Astley family held the Manor until    
 1750 when it passed to Earl Howe of   
 Gopsall. Hasting's land passed to the 
 Earl of Kent (1571) with tenants from 
 the Cocks,Barford and Neville families</content>
