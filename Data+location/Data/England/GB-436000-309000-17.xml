		<title>17Heather Football Club</title>
		<content> Heather Football Club was formed on   
 October 6th 1949, and the first       
 meeting took place at Heather school. 
 The club was named after the Parish   
 Church: Heather St. John's Football   
 Club.  All organisations have to be   
 financed in some way.  Our football   
 club started by each player paying    
 3d, just over 1p per game.  The first 
 fund-raising was a raffle, the prizes 
 being two ducks and a packet of twenty
 cigarettes, and each ticket cost 3d.  
 Now, the Club has two teams in the    
 Leicester and District League.  Most  
 of the players and committee live or  
 have lived in the village, and our aim
 is to recruit as many local lads as   
 possible.  The Club still plays on the
 same pitch as they did in 1949.
