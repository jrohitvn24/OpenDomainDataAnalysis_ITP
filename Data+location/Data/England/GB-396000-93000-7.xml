		<title>07The inside of my house</title>
		<content> The inside of our house is not modern 
 but the gadgets are. In the kitchen we
 have a gas hob, warming drawer, grill 
 and oven. We also have a microwave    
 oven, tumble dryer, washing machine,  
 electric kettle, food mixer, fridge,  
 freezer, wall can-opener and a        
 pressure cooker. We have lots of      
 cupboards and drawers. In the living  
 room we have a video,tv, record player
 and gas fire.In my bedroom I also have
 a record player, clock-radio and a    
 table lamp. In my brother's room he's 
 got a radio and a lamp. In my mum and 
 dad's room they also have a radio and 
 alarm clock.All the gadgets are       
 useful,but my mum thinks the microwave
 is the most useful because it saves   
 her a lot of time.
