		<content> This farm is part of the National     
 Agricultural Centre and owned by the  
 Royal Agricultural Society of England.
 Mr.Bassett is the tenant who lives at 
 the farm,he is also in charge of an   
 important part of the N.A.C.The       
 overall size of the N.A.C. is 546 ha. 
 of which this farm forms less than a  
 quarter. Although the entire concern  
 has large numbers of dairy cattle,    
 sheep, pigs, and poultry this section 
 is almost entirely arable land with   
 potatoes, wheat, barley and           
 experimental cereal plots.Field sizes 
 range from 15ha. to 2ha.Mr Bassett    
 runs a highly  efficent mechanised    
 unit with detailed records of land use
 and past yields being kept in a       
 separate office located next to the   
 farmhouse.Main expenditure items are  
 electricity,diesel fuel and wages.
