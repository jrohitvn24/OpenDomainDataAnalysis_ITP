		<title>13The Old School House.</title>
		<content>    On the south edge of the village of
Edingale is an old, recently restored  
building known as the Old School House.
Attached to the house is a Victorian   
school which was in use until 1916. The
School House is a much older           
construction and demonstrates many     
original features.                     
  It is thought to be one of the oldest
houses in South-East Staffordshire     
probably dating from around 1480. It is
built in a style rare to Staffordshire 
but common in Warwickshire. Originally 
it consisted of a main Hall, open to   
the roof, with a mullioned window, and 
a Cross-wing which was divided into two
storeys. It would have been the home of
a wealthy, yeoman farmer and his       
household. The farmer and his family   
would have lived in the front parlour  
of the cross-wing where the ceiling    
beams are of better quality wood.      </content>
