 There are 4 Church of England churches
 in the area. The Meon Valley was      
 evangelised by St.Wilfred in the 7th  
 century so the sites of these churches
 are thought to be very early.         
 The parishes of Exton, Meonstoke and  
 Corhampton are all under the care of  
 the Rector of the neighbouring parish 
 of Droxford. They are in the diocese  
 of Portsmouth.                        
                                       
                                       
 Warnford parish is joined with the    
 Parish of West Meon.
