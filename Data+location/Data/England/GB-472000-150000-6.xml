		<title>06NORTH WARNBOROUGH. THE M3</title>
		<content> At the round-about by the M3 Junction,
 the A287,the A30 and the A32 roads    
 meet. The M3 Junction is very busy    
 with cars,vans, heavy lorries and     
 motor- bikes each day. The new Farnham
 by-pass helps to keep the traffic     
 flowing smoothly and quickly.         
 Near the M3 Junction there is a large 
 Motor-way Maintenance Depot containing
 many vehicles to keep the Motor-way   
 serviceable during the winter months. 
 The primary land cover is deciduous   
 woodland, consisting of Oak, Hazel,   
 Beech and Horse-chestnut trees. Nearby
 is a private plantation of Conifers.  
 The secondary land cover surrounding  
 the M3 Junction is farm-land,with     
 wheat crops and a few fields for rough
 grazing. A private estate of sixteen  
 houses has recently been completed at 
 Bartley Heath, nearby. The Bartley    
 Heath Pottery produces hand-made goods</content>
