		<title>17MY HOBBY - HORSE RIDING 1</title>
		<content>  AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF HOME LIFE FOR
 ME IS GETTING UP AT BETWEEN 5.3O AND  
 6AM, SO THAT I CAN DO OUR HORSES      
 PROPERLY AND NOT BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.  
  THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO GIVE THEM
 THEIR FEEDS OF BRAN, CHAFF, PONY NUTS 
 AND HAY. IF THE HORSES ARE GOING TO BE
 WORKED THAT DAY, THEN I GIVE THEM     
 SOAKED SUGAR BEET WITH THE FEED. I    
 HAVE TO WET DOWN ONE OF THE HORSES'   
 HAY, AS SHE IS ALLERGIC TO DUST AND   
 THE WATER SETTLES IT.                 
  THE BIG THING WITH HORSES IS TO BE   
 PATIENT BUT FIRM AND NOT TO SHOUT OR  
 LOSE YOUR TEMPER AS THAT WORKS WITH   
 FEW. YOU SHOULD PRAISE THE HORSE OR   
 PONY WHEN IT HAS DONE RIGHT AND JUST  
 SPEAK SOFTLY BUT FIRMLY WHEN WRONG.   
 FEW HORSES HAVE REAL MALICE. THEY ARE 
 NAUGHTY WHEN FRIGHTENED OR JUST OUT OF
 STUBBORNESS.                          
                                       </content>
