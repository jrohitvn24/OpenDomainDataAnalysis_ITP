		<title>14FELBRIGG HALL</title>
		<content>  Felbrigg Hall was built between 1621 
 and 1624.  The West Wing was added in 
 the 1680's.  23 of it's rooms are open
 to the public, and it also has a tea  
 room, restaurant, and a gift shop.    
  The Hall was taken over by the       
{National Trust}in 1969, when its last 
 owner died.  The{Felbrigg Estate      
 covers 526 hectares, of which 240 are 
 woodland.  There is a walled garden,  
 which has a dovecote, and greenhouses.
 As well as the main rooms, there are  
 some secret passages, and a priest    
 hole.                                 
  The Hall also displays many works of 
 art, and antiques.  It gets most of   
 its visitors in the summer, and there 
 are guides in each room, telling the  
 visitors about the history of items in
 the room.                             
  Christmas trees grown in the grounds 
 are sold from December 1st each year. </content>
