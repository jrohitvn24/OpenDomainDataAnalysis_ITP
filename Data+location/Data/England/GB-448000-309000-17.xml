		<content> Mayflower Court is a block of flats   
 for the elderly.There is a warden in  
 the flats who is there to look after  
 the people.She calls in on them every 
 morning to see if they are all        
 right.If somebody is ill in the night 
 there is a red cord in each flat for  
 them to pull. When it is pulled an    
 alarm sounds and green and red lights 
 flash in the warden's flat.The warden 
 will go to see what the problem is.   
 The flats have a little kitchen, a    
 bathroom, a lounge and a little room  
 room that is added on with no door. My
 nanna has lace curtains so that you   
 cannot see into the bedroom.When you  
 open the front door there is a big    
 wardrobe on the right and on the left 
 a utility room for brushes etc. The   
 elderly people like to go to          
 clubs.They play cards and go on trips.
