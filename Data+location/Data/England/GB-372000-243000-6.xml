		<title>06THE CLIFFE FAMILY.</title>
		<content>   The Cliffe family lived in Mathon   
 and owned a pub named after them.It   
 was most probably built about 400     
 years ago.After a while,about 7 years 
 ago,its name was changed to Trundle   
 Inn,but unfortunately nobody went     
 there and so they changed it back to  
 its old name The Cliffe Arms,now it is
 always full again.                    
   The family originally owned Mathon  
 village,the village was in the        
 original Domesday Book.               
   The Cliffe family lived in Mathon   
 from about 1070.When they died they   
 were put in Mathon church.Elizabeth   
 Cliffe was burried under the floor and
 wished{never to be lifted by human    
{hands.}
