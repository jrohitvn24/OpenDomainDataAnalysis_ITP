		<title>09KESTREL BY THE MOTORWAY.</title>
		<content>   In the central reservation between  
 the two lanes of the A1(M) motorway   
 south of the interchange with the A68 
 we observed a kestral which seemed to 
 have its nest in the grass there. It  
 flew up into the sky and hovered over 
 a nearby field and attacked something 
 in the field. It then carried what    
 appeared to be its prey back to the   
 central reservation. We were anable to
 verify whether our assumption that it 
 was nesting there was true because of 
 the inaccessibility of the spot.      
   However, this inaccessibility makes 
 it an ideal spot for the kestral to   
 next in an area which would otherwise 
 be unsafe because of its closeness to 
 a built-up area.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
