		<content>   Farming Changes- Since the beginning
 of World War 2 farming has changed    
 greatly. Land drainage has altered the
 balance of farming .Fields now drained
 are better suited to crop production  
 than to cattle production.Most farms  
 are still family concerns of average  
 size _200 to 500 acres. Mixed farming 
 is still popular and a variety of     
 crops are grown. Recently intensive   
 factory farming has evolved with two  
 such farmers in the area growing vast 
 acreages of high value crops such as  
 potatoes and oil seed rape on rented  
 and their own land. These farms have  
 rapidly grown. Another change has     
 resulted from the increased dependence
 on machinery and a decreased need for 
 manual labour. Before 1940 a farm     
 employing 10 men now employs only     
 2.The result is cost effective        
 production but loss of village life.  </content>
