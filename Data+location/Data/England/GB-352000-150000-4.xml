		<title>04ANCIENT SITES IN PRIDDY</title>
		<content> The best known site is called Priddy  
 Nine Barrows, a bronze age burial     
 ground  which dates from 1800BC. This 
 is in fact just part of a larger group
 of barrows but gets its name from the 
 fact that viewed from the Parish      
 church just nine can be seen on the   
 skyline.                              
 Priddy Circles are even earlier.      
 Little remains of this late neolithic 
 henge monument but when seen from the 
 air, the crop marked outlines of 3    
 complete and 1 broken circle are      
 clearly visible.                      
 A Roman road, which was used for the  
 transportation of lead from nearby    
 Charterhouse, cuts through the north  
 of the area and the modern road       
 follows its path.                     
 Finds from these sites can be found in
 the museums in Wells and Taunton.
