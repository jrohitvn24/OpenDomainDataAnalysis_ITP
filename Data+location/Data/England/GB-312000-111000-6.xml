		<content> Entertainment is provided by members  
 of the village who organise dances,   
 talks, musicals and shows. Hemyock    
 singers meet regularly and from time  
 to time perform stage shows and       
 concerts. To see professional theatre 
 you have to go to Taunton or          
 Wellington in Somerset, or Tiverton   
 or Exeter in Devon .The school puts on
 plays and concerts during the year    
 which parents and their friends can   
 come to watch in the school.The       
 village hall is used for most         
 presentions as it has a stage and is  
 the largest hall. The methodist church
 and the parish church both have small 
 halls.                                
 Each year, in September, a carnival is
 held when villagers decorate floats   
 and dress up for a parade through the 
 village, followed by a dance.
