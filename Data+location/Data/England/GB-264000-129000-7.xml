		<title>07West Buckland Garage</title>
		<content> Mr.Adams has owned the garage for 4   
 years.He has lived in Landkey all his 
 life.He always wanted to own a        
 garage.He has to travel 4 miles to    
 work every day.The garage sells petrol
 and repairs cars sells a few second   
 hand cars.He is in favour of the new  
 link road because it will probably    
 bring more customers.                 
 He would like to move to Canada       
 because he likes the countryside out  
 there.                                
 He works 10 hours 6 days a week but   
 always has Sunday off,when he likes to
 watch motor racing.                   
 He repairs 3-4 cars a day,about 80 a  
 month.His ambition is to make the     
 garage very profitable and build his  
 own house with a swimming pool.He says
 if he was not in the garage business  
 there is nothing else he would want to
 do.                                   </content>
