		<content> Headlands Secondary School is the     
 largest school in North East          
 Swindon.It was formed in 1983,when    
 Headlands senior high school,Penhill  
 and Pinehurst junior high schools were
 merged to form one 11-16 comprehensive
 school.To start with there were 1600  
 pupils,but the school no longer has a 
 sixth form as a new sixth form college
 has been established to take sixth    
 formers from all over Swindon.The     
 school is on two sites with three     
 different buildings.The lower school  
 (first and second years)occupies the  
 old Penhill site,and the third,       
 fourth and fifth years are in the     
 Headlands building half a mile down   
 Cricklade Road.The teachers have to   
 use their own cars or taxis to travel 
 from one building to another.
