   Whitchurch is a small country town  
 in Northern Hampshire.It is situated  
 in the valley of the River Test.The   
 town is situated at the crossroads of 
 the road from Basingstoke to Andover  
 and the road from Southampton to the  
 Midlands,although this road is now    
 taken around the town by a by-pass.   
   The population of the town          
 is approximately four thousand        
 people,many of whom do not work in the
 town but travel to such places as     
 Basingstoke,Southampton and London.   
   There are no large industries in    
 Whitchurch,most of the jobs which are 
 in the town are mainly in small       
 firms,shops and offices.
