		<content> Our sector is in a beautiful area of  
 the country-very hilly and with       
 striking scenery.It is in the         
 Yorkshire Dales National Park.It is   
 principally rural and contains only 2 
 villages-Kirkby Malham  and Airton,2  
 hamlets-Hanlith and Calton,and a few  
 outlying farms.                       
 The block itself is not very tourist  
 orientated,although to get to Malham,a
 popular tourist resort,one must pass  
 through it.                           
 The community is very insular,and any 
 events,such as coffee mornings,tend to
 be attended by people from throughout 
 Malhamdale.It is also very traditional
 and dislikes change of any kind.      
{NOTE:}Although called Malhamdale,this 
 block does not actually contain Malham
 itself.
