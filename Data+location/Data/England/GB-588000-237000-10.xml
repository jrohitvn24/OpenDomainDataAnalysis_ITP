		<title>10BAKER'S MILL  GRT.C.</title>
		<content>                                       
Bakers Mill was built in 800 AD. The   
mill was mentioned in the Domesday     
Book. In 1850 when the Baker family    
owned the mill they built extra parts  
to the mill. In 800 AD the lord of the 
Manor lived in Abbas Hall. Most of the 
flour was taken to the lord. In 1086   
the Mill only had two or three workers 
now there are 105 workers. In 1970 they
finished making flour. The Bakers now  
make cat and dog food and also farm    
animal food. The workers put soya,fish 
meat,wheat and maize in the mix for the
cat food, and wheat,dried meat for the 
dog food. The extruder is something    
like a pressure cooker it has a shape  
at the back and the dog food goes      
through this   shape and into plates   
and is then dried.   Then, when it is  
dried, the dog and cat food is put into
packets.                               </content>
