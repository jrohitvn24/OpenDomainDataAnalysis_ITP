		<content> In the playground we sometimes play   
 'Sharks'. It is a game played with    
 lots of people. We usually play it    
 between two walls. One person is on   
 'it' and they call someones name, e.g.
 Lucy.So Lucy would have to try and run
 to the other side without being       
 caught. If she gets caught she would  
 be on 'it' with the other person, but 
 if she gets across then the rest of us
 have to run across. If the person who 
 is on 'it' calls 'Sharks'that means we
 all try to get across to the other    
 side, and the person on 'it' can catch
 as many people as they can. As more   
 people get caught the game becomes    
 harder, as there is more than one     
 person on 'it'. We play lots of other 
 games in the playground, but I enjoy  
 this one the most.
