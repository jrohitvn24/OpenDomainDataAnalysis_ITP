		<content>   In Craze Loman we interviewed some  
 people. Years ago most people worked  
 on farms in the area. A man,who was a 
 retired farm worker,told us that they 
 used to produce most of their own food
 on the farm. The rest was bought in   
 Tiverton. Nowadays most of the people 
 go into Tiverton to work. They also go
 there for shopping. Years ago they    
 used to entertain themselves by having
 visitors, playing games, gardening and
 going for walks. Nowadays the older   
 people do much the same thing.        
   The things that have changed are    
 that the old Mill House is now a place
 where soft toys are made. The Link    
 Road has changed Craze Loman quite a  
 lot because of its noise and          
 disturbance. Some new cottages have   
 been built along with a new bungalow.
