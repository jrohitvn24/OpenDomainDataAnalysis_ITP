		<title>06Tockwith Working Mothers.</title>
		<content>   This survey concerns mothers only,  
 providing they are not head of        
 household, in which case they fall    
 into Job Survey 1.                    
   41% of the mothers hold jobs, mostly
 day time jobs. 50% work part-time.    
 They travel on average 18 miles a day 
 to and from work, tending to work     
 nearer home than the heads of         
 households.                           
   64% have a second car in the family,
 which they use to drive to work.      
   Most working mothers have children  
 at the village school. The majority of
 pre-school children of working mothers
 are looked after by local registered  
 child minders.
