		<content>  The lodge was built in 1765.         
Originally it was a workhouse which    
has developed into a hospital.It was   
included in the National Health Service
in 1942.                               
  The elderly,the young,the physically 
disabled and anyone in the community   
who has a doctor at Stowmarket Health  
Centre can use the hospital.           
  There are 5 wards in the Lodge and   
179 nurses although not all of them    
work full time.If however all the      
staff were full time they would only   
need 133 staff.Physiotherapists,speech 
therapists,dieticians,cooks,hair       
dressers and cleaners are also         
employed.                              
  111 patients stay over night at the  
lodge and 24 are just day patients,    
making a total of 135 patients.
