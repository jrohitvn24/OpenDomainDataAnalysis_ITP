		<content> Because of a well documented history  
 going back to the middle ages this    
 area has maintained a very protective 
 pride. While realizing that tourism is
 their livelihood tourists and 'off    
 comers' are quietly resented and a    
 'locals only' housing policy was put  
 forward but turned down by the Dept.  
 of the Environment. This caused strong
 feeling and is to be pursued. Much    
 property is in the 'second home'      
 category, pushing up the price and    
 making it impossible for local people 
 to buy. Large touring coaches are now 
 allowed on narrow roads and are much  
 resented. People would like smaller,  
 more frequent buses for local use.    
 The district has a long history of    
 being Conservative. There is no       
 unemployment despite national figures 
 and no one lives on social security.
