		<title>03Housing in Verwood.</title>
		<content> The{population}in Verwood is          
 approximately 9,000. There are 3,637  
 dwellings today and 200 houses are    
 built each year. Many{materials}are   
 used in building homes today.         
  eg:- bricks, insulation blocks,      
 timber frames and roofing tiles.      
 Blocks of flats and terraced houses   
 are becoming the trend. Most modern   
 gardens are small, as land is so      
 expensive there are approximately 70  
 cottages of{Cobb/Mud}walled           
 construction, many built in the late  
 nineteenth century. A number of houses
 built then were built from Verwood    
 bricks, some of which are white and   
 were made at Ebblake. The largest     
 house is in Verwood is the{Manor      
{House.}This is shortly to be          
 demolished to make way for homes for  
 elderly people.
