		<title>16EMMANUAL CHURCH SHELLEY</title>
		<content> The church was dedicated in September 
 of 1868. It is now 117 years old. In  
 the tower there are six bells all in  
 current use. Unfortunately the church 
 has no choir as the congregation      
 averages  twenty or thirty. The       
 vicar of the church has now been vicar
 for over a year. Altogether there have
 been sixteen vicars at Shelley church.
 The vicar who has stayed the longest  
 was there about nineteen years. In the
 church there used to be a pipe organ  
 but then in 1968 it was changed to an 
 electric model. The church has eight  
 stained glass windows, two are modern 
 and the other six are old.
