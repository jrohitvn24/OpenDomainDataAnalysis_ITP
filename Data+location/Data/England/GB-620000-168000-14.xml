		<content>   Most of the housing in our area is  
modern although there is one noticeable
exception,a Georgian manor house.Most  
of the houses have been built since the
Second World War.We discovered by      
interviewing children at Reculver      
School that less than half of them have
 born in the area.Quite a large number 
were born in London.most of them came  
to live here about five to ten years   
ago and most moved into new or nearly  
new homes.Most children lived in houses
but bungalows seem very popular with   
older people near retirement, there are
 te a number of older people in our    
block.House prices range from about    
30,000 to 90,000 pounds although most  
are priced at about 45,000.Nearly every
atch of spare ground is soon bought up 
bbuilders and new houses and bungalows 
built.
