 evenings at 6.15pm at the United      
 Reform Church hall in Whitchurch.The  
 107th Cub pack meets on Wednesday     
 evenings between 6.30-8.30pm at the   
 Scout hut in Maggs Lane.The Brownies  
 wear a brown uniform and the Cubs wear
 a green uniform.At the meetings the   
 children play games and prepare       
 different items in order to obtain    
 badges,such as Conservation,Toymaker, 
 Swimming and Safety in the Home.During
 May the Brownies and Cubs enjoyed
