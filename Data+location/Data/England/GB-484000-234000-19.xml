		<title>19Birds of Mount Farm Lake</title>
		<content>   Mount Farm Lake was a gravel pit    
 until it was abandoned in 1937.Then in
 1974 M.K.D.C.landscaped it.Now it is  
 fairly shallow and there are many     
 fish.There is a large island for      
 nesting and a small one that used to  
 be a fishing platform.The lake is open
 water surrounded by a belt of reeds   
 and a few trees.Water from nearby     
 roads drains into the lake which      
 means that salt and oil are dangers,  
 though there are oil barriers.        
 Facilities for people are a pub,      
 playground,picnics,walking and        
 fishing.
