  The impression is of a neat, well    
kept residential village with the busy 
A425 running through the centre.       
Crossing the road can be very dangerous
due to the sharp  bend by the traffic  
island opposite the church.            
  There is one bus shelter;one post box
(another at Bascote Heath);one         
telephone box;twelve street lamps and  
two litter bins.                       
  The one public building, apart from  
the church, is the village hall built  
in 1923.                               
  The main part of the village consists
of Harbury Lane with St.Michaels Cl;   
Broad Cl. and Reeds Park off it.School 
Lane is "one-way" past the pub.        
  Bascote Heath is approached along a  
tree lined road with the houses set    
back in the fields. There is one wood- 
built public house with garden.        </content>
