		<title>15The flint knapper</title>
		<content>A flint knapper is a person who        
skillfully chips flint into various    
sizes.He makes flints for flintlock    
guns which were invented in the 17th   
century.Mr.Fuller is now the only      
full time flint knapper in the         
world.He gets his flint from a mine in 
the South of England and he buys up to 
30 tonnes per year.                    
He starts his work in the summer       
because in the winter the flint is too 
wet and hard. He takes a piece of flint
and hits it with his hammer and chisel 
so that flakes of flint come off. Mr.  
Fuller chips about 100 flakes an hour. 
He then takes the flakes into the shed 
to be shaped into various sizes. In    
this shed he has an extractor fan to   
get rid of the silica dust which comes 
off the flint.He is able to judge the  
size through experience.He sells the   
flint to America .                     </content>
