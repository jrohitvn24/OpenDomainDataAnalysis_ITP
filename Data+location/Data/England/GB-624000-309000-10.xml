		<title>10Heartsease Area</title>
		<content>   Most of the land in this area is    
 residential ,mainly modern semi-      
 detached and terrace houses with both 
 a front and a back garden.All the     
 houses are set back from the road.    
   There are groups of shops scattered 
 around the Heartsease estate. These   
 shops consist of newsagents,food shops
 ,hot takeaway foods and a post office.
  There are 4 schools: Heartsease High,
 Heartsease  and First, and Woodside   
 First.Woodside Middle will be closed  
 at the end of the Summer Term due to  
 falling rolls and the older children  
 will all then attend Heartsease Middle
 . As there is now a large new estate  
 being built close to the Woodside     
 Schools the buildings will be retained
 for possible future use.              
   There are 4 bus services. There are 
 also 2 churches and a community centre
 next to Heartsease High School.       </content>
