		<content>I gave questionnaires to 60 children   
with an age range from 11-15 years.Iwas
trying to find out how and where they  
spent their free time.Here are my      
results:                               
9% have been to the cinema recently.   
66% have videos at home. 75% watch 4 or
more hours of T.V. Only about 4% go to 
the theatre or the opera. When asked   
what places they would like to go to if
they could;80% said cinema, 70% said   
disco, and 60% said sports events.     
   60% of the people surveyed had      
recently read a book.The most popular  
books were about every day life or     
animals.Musical tastes varied and 40%  
had actually bought a record recently. 
I think the survey shows that teenagers
depend on T.V.for most of their        
entertainment.It is interesting that so
many would like to go to the cinema but
very few actually do.BY PAULA MESSAM.  </content>
