		<title>14HOUSING IN TOW LAW, DURHAM.</title>
		<content>{Many of the houses in and around Tow  
{Law, Co. Durham, were built of local  
{stone during the late 19th. century.  
{The long terraced rows have since been
{extensively modernised.               
                                       
 During the 1950's, estates of mainly  
 semi-detached houses were built on a  
 number of sites. They are typical of  
 post-war housing having pebble-dashed 
 walls and tiled roofs.                
                                       
 Due to mining which had been carried  
 out all around Tow Law few sites are  
 now available for any future building.
 However a number of brick bungalows   
 have been built where space has been  
 available. These are mainly detached. 
                                       
 An old people's home with individual  
 rooms and a communal lounge was built 
 during the 1970's.                    </content>
