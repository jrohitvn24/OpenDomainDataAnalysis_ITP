		<title>11Places of Worship</title>
		<content> There are two places of worship in the
 area. There are many fine examples of 
 historical additions right up to the  
 present day. The rood loft is one of  
 the very few to have survived the     
 Reformation. It was concealed uniquely
 behind a lathe and plaster covering   
 against the east wall of the nave and 
 discovered there in 1810. The Church  
 today is visited by thousands of      
 tourists. It it is mainly the tourists
 money that keeps the Church in good   
 repair.
