		<content> There are no proper shopping          
 facilities.  The sub Post Office      
 offers Giro banking in addition to    
 normal Post Office trade.  Sweets and 
 cigarettes are also on sale at the    
 Post office and at a small            
 confectionary shop.  All shopping is  
 done outside the area, free buses to  
 local markets and hypermarkets are    
 provided.  Milk and bread are         
 delivered daily, National Daily       
 newspapers and magazines also. There  
 are two local newspapers delivered    
 weekly, The Lydney Observer and The   
 Forest Review which is a free         
 newspaper.  Fresh fish is also        
 delivered weekly.  Mail order         
 catalogues are available.
