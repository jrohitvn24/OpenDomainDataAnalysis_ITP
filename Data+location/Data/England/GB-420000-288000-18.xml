		<title>18Microtechnology in Coleshill</title>
		<content>  A group of  children from Coleshill  
 Middle School took a microtechnology  
 survey in the town.They had to go into
 every business and ask:               
 1.The name of the firm                
 2.The business Address                
 3.The number of electronic aids       
 4.What work they were used for        
  Everyone was very helpful.Some people
 didn't even know what microtechnology 
 was even when they had a computerised 
 telephone or photocopier.We were very 
 surprised to find that Banks had very 
 few computers.                        
 There were 61 computers in the town   
 but most were in Chantry House,travel 
 agents and building societies.We      
 thaught there would be many computers 
 in Banks Dentists and Doctors with    
 very few in smaller firms but it      
 turned out to be the opposite.
