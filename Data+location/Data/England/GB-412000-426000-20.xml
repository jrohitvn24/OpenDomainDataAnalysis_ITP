		<title>20WYKE MIDDLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The information about this block was
 collected and collated by fourth year 
 children at High Fernley First School 
 and Wyke Middle School.               
   Education in Bradford is based on a 
 three tier system.  Pupils who attend 
 Wyke Middle School come from three    
 feeder first schools at the age of    
 nine.  High Fernley is one of these   
 feeder schools.  Pupils leave middle  
 school at thirteen and most children  
 move on to Wyke Manor Upper School.   
   Wyke Middle is organised in four    
 year groups with a team of teachers   
 assigned to each.  In the 1st and 2nd 
 years, teaching is class teacher      
 based, but years three and four spend 
 more time with specialist teachers.   
   Major events in this school year    
 have been fund-raising efforts for the
 Ethiopian Famine Relief and the       
 Bradford City Football Disaster.      </content>
