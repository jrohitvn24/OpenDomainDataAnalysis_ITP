Elford has a thriving Cricket Club     
founded over 50 years ago.             
Mr. P. Hodgetts is President and       
matches are played every week-end. The 
team play all the local villages and   
there is a good balance of sportmanship
and social comradeship. There is       
special provision for the younger      
generation to play on Monday evenings. 
In comparison the football Club was    
formed only 3 years ago for the boys of
village. They play in a league and have
a presentation evening every year.     
Grass roots tennis is coached at       
school. There are rambles organised    
for adults and children and the public 
footpaths are walked by the different  
organisations.
