		<title>14HEREFORD ABERGAVENNY TRAMWAY</title>
		<content> Before the advent of the railway this 
 was the main route for the transport  
 of{coal}between Abergavenny and       
 Hereford.{Horses}provided the motive  
 power.                                
 The earthworks of this tramway are    
 still visible for quite a distance in 
 this area running adjacent to the     
 northwest side of the main road from  
 just north of Pontrilas to Howton     
 Grove Farm, crossing the road at this 
 point and continuing across the fields
 over the Worm Brook and crossing the  
 railway line to the North East of     
 Grove Park. From this point it becomes
 mostly indistinct to Hereford but     
 obviously did pass close by Tram      
 Inn,Allensmore.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
