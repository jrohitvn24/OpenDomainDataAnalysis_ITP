		<title>03BENGES WOOD</title>
		<content> A large and well known wood made up of
 mainly beech, sycamore and conifers   
 and some ash.  Many beech in this area
 are suffering from beech bark disease.
 Lilywhites of Charlton use part of    
 this woodland to run their sawmill.   
 "Benges" is a much used name in the   
 area.  The A285 running past the wood 
 is known as "The Benges" and so is the
 cottage at the top of the rise        
 dividing Ides Common and Benges Wood. 
 Part of the wood is Forestry Commision
 land and the Forestry Commision has   
 called it Selhurst Park Wood.  The    
 locals still call it Benges Wood.     
 Deer are frequently seen here, and    
 warning signs are on the road.
