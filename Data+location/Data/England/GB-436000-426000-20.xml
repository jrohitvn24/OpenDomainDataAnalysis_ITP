		<title>20Changes in Woodlesford</title>
		<content> One of our most famous local people is
 Alf Roberts.  He is now 77 years old  
 but still fit and healthy.  He was    
 M.P. for our area for 32 years until  
 he retired in 1983.  He told us about 
 how Woodlesford and Oulton had changed
 since he was a child.  The biggest    
 difference was that at that time he   
 said that Woodlesford was a very      
 lonely place mainly surrounded by     
 woods and fields.  Now most of our    
 area is covered with houses and it is 
 hard to see where Woodlesford and     
 Oulton begin or end.  The people who  
 lived in Woodlesford were very poor.  
 Mr. Roberts worked in the quarries and
 the pits, but none of these jobs are  
 left now.  He said school was very    
 strict and if you did not work hard   
 enough you would stay in the baby     
 class.                                
                                       </content>
