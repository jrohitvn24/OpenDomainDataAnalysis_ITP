		<title>13CHANGING TIMES IN BARSBY (2)</title>
		<content>  One of the more regretable ways in   
 which Barsby has changed is the       
 increase in road traffic. cars were   
 not catered for when Barsby was built,
 and now they congest the roads, at    
 times spoil the appearance of the     
 village, and have have even caused the
 division of the village because of the
 volume traffic on the main road,      
 nevertheless most residents feel that 
 a car is a necesity.                  
  Residents of Barsby are kept informed
 of all the local news by two local    
 newspapers the Leicester Mercury and  
 the County Mercury also barsby        
 villagers do have some community      
 services such as the womens institute 
 and the mothers union.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
