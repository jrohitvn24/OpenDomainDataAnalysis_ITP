		<title>10THE LIFE OF A VICAR</title>
		<content> The Reverend J. Maynard is the vicar  
 of St. Thomas a Becket, the parish    
 church of Pagham. (see page 2)  He has
 been in the parish for fifteen years. 
                                       
 We found out that he is a very busy   
 man.  In the week before we saw him he
 had taken one funeral, two weddings,  
 the blessing of a marriage, a baptism 
 and a burial of ashes.  Also quite    
 some time had been spent in planning  
 services and printing posters for a   
 flower festival.  He had also taken   
 confirmation classes.                 
                                       
 Once a month he goes to Kings Haven,  
 which is an old people's home.  He    
 also visits the old people at Pagham  
 Windmill.  Mr. Maynard visits         
 hospitals and takes communion to      
 people who cannot get to church.
