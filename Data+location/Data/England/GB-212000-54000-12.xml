		<title>12TRANSPORT IN LERRYN &amp; GOLANT</title>
		<content>      Not many{buses}come to{Lerryn.   
 There is one on Tuesdays and Fridays  
 to{St Austell,}and one on Thursday to 
{Bodmin.}None go to{Golant.}Most       
 people use the buses to go shopping.  
 If they only have small amounts of    
 food and provisions to buy, they can  
 shop at the village shop.             
    The majority of people in{Lerryn   
{and Golant}have a car.                
     All the children, apart from those
 of primary age in the{Lerryn}area,    
 have to go to school on school        
 buses, this means that some children  
 have to leave home before 8 o'clock in
 the morning. In{Golant}they have a    
 mini bus to take the children to      
 school. The rest of the children      
 either have to walk or are brought by 
 their parents in cars.  In some cases 
 children travel to school by taxi.
