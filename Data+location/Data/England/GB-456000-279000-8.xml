		<content> There is a wide variety of buildings  
 in our area spanning seven centuries. 
 The oldest must be the Church dating  
 back to Norman times. The{oldest house
 is the{Manor House}dated 1690.        
  There are several timber frame       
 buildings but the thatched roofs on   
 some have been replaced by slate and  
 the mud infill between the timbers, by
 bricks. Most of the buildings are two 
 storey red brick with roofs of slate  
 or tiles. The local bricks are soft   
 and soon let the rain through so many 
 19th century houses have been rendered
 and painted.                          
  There are some small sections of mud 
 wall in the village, some of which    
 have been restored. There are three   
 small{council estates}and two{private 
{estates}in the village. A large part  
 of the village falls within the{      
{conservation area. }                  </content>
