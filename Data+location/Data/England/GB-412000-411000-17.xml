		<title>17HOLME VALLEY HOUSING (2)</title>
		<content>   The first major break from the use  
 of thse traditional materials came    
 with the building of council house    
 estates. One in Honley is of red brick
 homes, semi-detached or in short      
 terraces.                             
   After Local Government changes in   
 1974, the Holme Valley was designated 
 as suitable for housing development.  
 That which has since taken place has  
 been mainly in the private sector.    
 These estates of detached and semi-   
 detached homes have climbed up the    
 valley sides reducing woodland and    
 farmland. They are often of artificial
 stone construction although real stone
 is still used for the more expensive. 
   In the valley bottom some clearance 
 and renewal has taken place.  At Berry
 Brow this resulted in the construction
 of two tower blocks of flats which    
 have been subject to some criticism.  </content>
