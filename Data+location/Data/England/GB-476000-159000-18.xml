		<content>    Eversley has had a place of worship
 for thousands of years. There is one  
 church in the area and it is Church of
 England.{The Rev. Michael Perry}is the
 present rector. This year it is the   
 250th anniversary of the bell-tower   
 being built. Two bells are being      
 restored, two new bells installed and 
 there is space for two more bells in  
 years to come. More land has been     
 purchased to extend the graveyard.    
 There are 172 people on the electoral 
 roll, but 320 households in the       
 village have connections with the     
 church through youth organisations,   
 Sunday Schools and Bible-study groups.
 The civil parish covers Eversley      
 whereas the ecclesiastical parish     
 covers Eversley and Bramshill. The    
 most well-attended service is the     
 Family Service on the first Sunday in 
 the month with 150 people.            </content>
