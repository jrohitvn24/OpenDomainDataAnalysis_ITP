		<content>    There is a walk in Burwash that I  
 go on quite often, it starts at the   
 Bear Car Park. You need to walk       
 through the car park to get to the    
 field, this field leads to another and
 usually there are cows grazing here.  
 Then you walk through some corn and   
 every time I go on this walk the corn 
 field is different, it is either thick
 with corn or it has been ploughed     
 and has deep furrows or it is just a  
 muddy mess and then by a certain stile
 there is always slushy mud just where 
 you need to put your feet to climb    
 over. I like this muddy walk.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
