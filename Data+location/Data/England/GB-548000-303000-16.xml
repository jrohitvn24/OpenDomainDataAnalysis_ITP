   {                                   
 The name Beaupre derives from the     
 family Beaupre who built a large manor
 house in Outwell shortly after 1500.  
 The house which was mainly brick built
 was substantially enlarged by the     
 Bells who were the successors to the  
 Beaupres. Despite its architectural   
 value the house was demolished in 1966
 but the name lives on locally; hence  
 the naming of Beaupre Community       
 Primary School (built 1939), Beaupre  
 Hall Grouped Home (built 1973> and    
 Beaupre Avenue (1966/7)which was built
 around the site of the house. Beaupre 
 Hall Farm still survives and is an    
 early 17th century building with      
 stepped gables, much modernised.      
 A painting of the Hall appears on one 
 side of the village sign with a       
 painting of the aqueduct on the other.</content>
