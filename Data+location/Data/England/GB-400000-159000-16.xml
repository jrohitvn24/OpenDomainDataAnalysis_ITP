		<title>16CHILDRENS GAMES IN DEVIZES.</title>
		<content> There are many types of games played  
 outdoors by children in Devizes most  
 of which involve running and catching 
 skills.Three of these are called      
 Bulldog,Tig and Bad Eggs.             
 One favourite is called Deck.To play  
 it you need a group of people,two of  
 whom are selected to chase.The rest   
 go and hide.  The two people who are  
 on 'it' wait a predetermined time     
 before trying to find the people who  
 are hiding.  When 'tigged' you become 
 one of the chasers. The first two     
 people to be caught become the chasers
 in the next game.                     
 Children also like to play traditional
 games on special courts or pitches,   
 whether at school or at a sports      
 centre.  Examples of these more       
 organised team games are football,    
 netball,volley-ball,cricket and       
 tennis.                               </content>
