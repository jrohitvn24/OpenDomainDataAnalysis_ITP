		<title>08A TYPICAL SOUTH LAKES FARM</title>
		<content> out with the mowing at silage &amp; hay   
 times.The main changes which have     
 taken place in agriculture over the   
 last 20 years have been,changes in    
 breeding,allowing much better dairy   
 animal to be reared.A large increase  
 in capital investment in              
 agriculture.More recently the cutback 
 in dairy products.The main problem    
 with farming today compared with 20   
 years ago is:-20 years ago the        
 difference between investment and     
 profit was economically viable.       
 Nowadays the difference between       
 investment and profit isn't           
 economically viable and speaking in   
 real terms the farmer of today would  
 be much better off selling up and     
 investing the money in shares or in a 
 building society.In recent years many 
 of the smaller farms have done just   
 that.                                 </content>
