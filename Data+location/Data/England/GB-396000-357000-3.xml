ON 8th MAY 1985 WE CELEBRATED THE      
FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF V.E.DAY. V.E.  
STANDS FOR VICTORY IN EUROPE. I DO NOT 
REMEMBER THE WAR BUT MY GRANDMOTHER    
AND GRANDFATHER DO. IN 1982 THERE WAS  
A WAR IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS BETWEEN  
BRITAIN AND ARGENTINIA. IN LEBANON     
THERE IS A WAR THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON  
FOR SEVERAL YEARS. IN THE LATE SIXTIES 
AMERICA WAS AT WAR  WITH VIETNAM WHERE 
A LOT A AMERICANS AND VIETNAMESE WERE  
KILLED. IN ETHIOPIA THERE ARE          
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STARVING BECAUSE   
THE CROPS HAVE  FAILED DUE TO LACK OF  
WATER. MANY COUNTRIES HAVE SENT FOOD TO
HELP FEED THE HUNGRY PEOPLE AND ON     
SATURAY JULY 11TH A CONCERT OF POP     
MUSIC WAS HELD WHICH WAS TELEVISED ALL 
OVER THE WORLD AND IT RAISED MANY      
MILLIONS OF POUNDS TO SEND TO ETHIOPIA.</content>
