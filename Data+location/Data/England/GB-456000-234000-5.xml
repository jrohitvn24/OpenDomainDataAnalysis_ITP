		<title>05Brackley market day</title>
		<content>   The market place on a Friday is     
crowded with stalls and people. There  
is a lot of noise, not from the market,
but from the traffic passing through   
the town. There are many cars,         
motorbikes and lorries. On some days it
is quite interesting to see all the old
cars going to Silverstone but it does  
make an extra amount of traffic.       
   The market square is usually full of
parked cars but at night it is a lorry 
park so the drivers can rest.          
   The market place is in the middle of
the main street so either side is lined
with shops. At the end of the square is
the Town Hall  with its bell and on top
is the weather vane. The square itself 
on market day is choc-a-block full of a
bustling, shuffling crowd. After the   
market is over, the square is full of  
rubbish.
