		<content>    I live in a semi-detached house on 
 Woodville Road,Penwortham.In my{family
 there is  my mum, my dad, my brother, 
 my sister and my dog. He is called    
 Jack. He is a Terrier.                
    I go to{Kingsfold}County Primary   
 School each day, from five-to-nine to 
 quarter-past three, and my best friend
 is in the same class. On Mondays at   
 school, it is my turn to go on the    
 computer and I can pick three more    
 people to use it with me.             
    When I have some{spare time,}I read
 or watch television, but most of my   
 spare time I spend with my dog. I also
 like swimming alot. I've only been to 
 the theatre once, with my class. We   
 saw Joseph And His Amazing Techni_    
 colour Dreamcoat. I have only been to 
 the cinema a few times, but the last  
 time I went I saw 'E.T.'.
