 belt.From there it is washed and      
 sorted to remove the clay and spar    
 rock and transported to more crushers 
 and conveyors where it is sorted and  
 crushed futher.At the end of the      
 process stone sizes range from 5mm    
 to 40mm.Most of the rock is used to   
 make concrete,bricks and tarmac.The   
 mixture for concrete is one measure of
 cement and 10 of limestone dust.A     
 small amount of water is added then it
 is delivered to the customer. The     
 bricks are made from a mixture of     
 limestone and granite squashed under  
 45 tonnes of pressure.The bricks are  
 stacked in piles of 400 with gaps so a
 fork-lift truck can easily carry them.
 They are dried naturally.Upto 1.5     
 million can be stored at once.The     
 tarmac is made from limestone,granite 
 and bitumen heated together.          </content>
