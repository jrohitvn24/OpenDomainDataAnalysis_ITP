		<content> Our area encompasses a large part of  
{Sheffield City Centre}and its northern
 suburbs of{Hillsborough, Walkley,     
{Crookes and Pitsmoor.}It is mainly a  
 residential area, with a variety of   
 housing from old terraces to modern   
 high-rise flats, much being built on  
 Sheffield's many hills.               
   There is some industry in the area, 
 including large engineering firms     
 (though many have now closed down) and
 various smaller new businesses.       
   The people of the area tend to have 
 lived there a long time. They have    
 relatively cheap housing,good shopping
 areas (locally and centrally) and easy
 travelling to the City Centre, as     
 Sheffield supports a cheap bus fare   
 policy. Shoppers are attracted to the 
 City Centre by modern shopping areas, 
 many pedestrianised, and good indoor  
 and outdoor markets.                  </content>
