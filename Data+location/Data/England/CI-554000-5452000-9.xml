		<title>09LES MIELLES DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> Le Parcq des Mielles Development Plan 
 has been going on for the past seven  
 years. In 1978 the States of Jersey   
 agreed to designate most of the land  
 bordering St Ouen's Bay to the "view  
 line" as conservation, recreation     
 or agricultural areas. The idea was to
 make sure that the area was maintained
 as an attraction to tourists and the  
 local population alike.               
                                       
                                       
 The main attraction of the area is the
 beach itself and there is a need for  
 plenty of parking spaces. However when
 onshore winds are blowing there are   
 lots of people who use the nearby sand
 dunes for sheltered sunbathing and    
 picnics. This has caused problems     
 because people and cars have caused   
 damage to the dunes and their         
 wildlife.                             </content>
