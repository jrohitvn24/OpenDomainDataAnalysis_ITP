		<title>19Wytham: modern problems.</title>
		<content> Problems in Wytham village are        
 discussed at parish meetings. Reports 
 on topics such as the improvements to 
 the village hall,the addition of      
 swings to the recreation ground, the  
 activities of the Parents' Association
 the claims on the Hope ffenell Trust, 
 new planning applications and the     
 dumping of rubbish are all            
 overshadowed by the discussion of     
 traffic problems. Consideration of the
 safety of the children being bussed to
 school has resulted in the use of a   
 mini bus and taxis,morning and evening
 The decision of the Department of     
 Transport to make changes on the A34  
 Trunk Road has lead to discussion and 
 alternative proposals from the people.
 Parking on the dangerous corners of   
 the road,and the use of the village so
 as to avoid the congestion at the     
 Peartree roundabout calls for action. </content>
