		<title>17OAKAMOOR'S INDUSTRIAL PAST</title>
		<content>The lime-kilns, and the brick terraced 
houses in the village and trailing     
along River-side,  reflect Oakamoor's  
industrial past.Much of the village was
built by Thomas Bolton and Sons for the
workers at the Copper and Brass Works  
which dominated the site now landscaped
as a picnic area.The river provided the
power for waterwheels which drove the  
machinery to make copper wire and pipes
and had brought other works to Oakamoor
before the Boltons came in 1852. Signs 
of past industrial activity can be seen
on the Picnic Area.The first trans-    
Atlantic cable was made at the Oakamoor
works and successfully laid in 1866.   
 Boltons built the chapel and a school 
and provided the Sports Ground. It was 
from the works that the village        
obtained the power to become the first 
to have electric street lighting.      
    Boltons left Oakamoor in 1963.     </content>
