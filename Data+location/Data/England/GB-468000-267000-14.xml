		<content> HOLDENBY. NO NEW BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN  
 BUILT THERE FOR MANY A YEAR. MOST OF  
 THE OLDER PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN        
 MODERNISEDD. ANY THAT FALL VACANT ARE 
 USUALLY VERY HIGHLY PRICED, THEY ARE  
 MAINLY ESTATE COTTAGES BELONGING TO   
 EARL SPENCER, WHO HAS NOW GAINED      
 PRESTIGE THROUGH MARRIAGE INTO THE    
 ROYAL FAMILY.                         
 SPRATTON. IN THE LAST TEN OR MORE     
 YEARS TWO FAIRLY LARGE ESTATES OF     
 PRIVATE HOUSING HAVE BEEN ERECTED.    
 THESE WOULD FETCH AROUND 3O,OOO EACH.
 BECAUSE OF THIS LOTS OF YOUNG FAMILIES
 HAVE SETTLED IN THE VILLAGE.  HIGHER  
 PRICED PROPERTIES ARE MAINLY IN-FILL  
 AND TEND TO BE OWNED BY PROFESSIONAL  
 CLASSES, WHO COMMUTE INTO NORTHAMPTON 
 OR POSSIBLY FURTHER AFIELD. ON THE    
 WHOLE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF HOUSES ARE  
 PRIVATELY OWNED AND ONE THIRD BELONG  
 TO THE COUNCIL.                       </content>
