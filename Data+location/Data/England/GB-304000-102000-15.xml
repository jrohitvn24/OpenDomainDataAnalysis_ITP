		<title>15A CHILD'S DAY IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> I usually get up for school at 7am and
 get changed into my school uniform &amp;  
 go downstairs. Our house is a reason- 
 able size with 4 bedrooms. It is also 
 a farm with 130 acres. When I have    
 finished playing my music which is the
 guitar and piano I have some cereal   
 for breakfast. When it is 9am I am    
 driven to school in the car. It is    
 about 1 mile to school and so some-   
 times I cycle. Most mornings at school
 we have English, Mental Maths, Play-  
 time, Assembly, more Maths &amp; Reading. 
 In the afternoon we have activities   
 like Swimming, Art, Project Work, etc.
 After school I sometimes play with my 
 friends. Also during the week I have  
 been going to quite a few activities  
 such as Music, Swimming, Cubs, and    
 Gymnastics. I usually go to bed at    
 8.30pm and read until 9pm.
