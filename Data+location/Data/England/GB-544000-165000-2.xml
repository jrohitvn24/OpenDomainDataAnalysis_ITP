		<title>02COMMUTING FROM PETTS WOOD</title>
		<content>25 000 season tickets are sold each    
year at {Petts Wood Station}. Fifty    
eight trains pass through each hour    
during the "rush hour". There are 8 -  
10 carriages in each train with 80     
seats in each carriage. Many extra     
people crowd into each carriage and    
stand all the way to London. Trains    
travel up to {Charing Cross},          
{Victoria} and {Cannon Street}         
therefore office workers, civil        
servants and newspaper workers find    
{Petts Wood} a convenient place to     
live. People who travel long distances 
every morning to get to work and every 
evening to get home are known as       
{commuters}. The trains which take     
them into the city are called commuter 
trains.
