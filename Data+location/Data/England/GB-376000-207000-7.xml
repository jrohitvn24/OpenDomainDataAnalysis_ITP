 On the farm they keep a Gloucester Old
 Spot pig. The main ingredient of the  
 famous Gloucester sausage.            
 Unfortunately people don't like the   
 pigs spots so the piglets have to be  
 sold to friends rather than the       
 market.                               
                                       
 One of the fields is sown with a ley  
 of clover and grass for the cattle to 
 eat as this provides good fodder.     
                                       
 The ground on the farm is very heavy  
 clay and drains badly so is not really
 suitable for arable crops.            
                                       
 Much of the local land is no longer   
 owned by local people but has been    
 bought by people from outside.
