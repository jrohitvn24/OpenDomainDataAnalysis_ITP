		<title>01HYTHE ROAD, FELTWELL</title>
		<content>   This block is cut into two by the   
 cut off channel, which runs along the 
 Eastern boundary of the Fens.         
   To the East lies the higher ground  
 made up of rolling chalk hills leading
 towards Breckland. Along this runs the
 road from Feltwell to Methwold Hythe. 
 The Northernmost edge of the village  
 of Feltwell appears in this block.    
   West of the Cut Off Channel the land
 is barely above sea level and         
 comprises peat soil, drained by       
 numerous dykes.                       
   Apart from the edge of Feltwell     
 Village the only inhabitants of the   
 block live at a farm on the Southery  
 Road, which runs through the South    
 Western corner of the block.
