		<content>     The block is rich in{flora and    
{fauna.  }The soils tend to be reddish 
 and of a slightly sandy nature.       
 Generally{winters}can be said to be   
 mild and damp.   When extreme         
 conditions are experienced this block 
 can be totally{cut off by snow.}      
 Summers are warm and moist.           
      Many of the established{elm trees
 were attacked by{Dutch Elm disease}and
 died. The landscape changed quite     
 considerably as trees were felled.    
 Ash, elms, hawthorns, alders, willows,
  hazel, holly and oaks are still seen 
 in the hedgerows.                     
     {Country lanes}have high banks on 
 either side and these are covered in a
 variety of wild flowers and grasses.In
 a mile stretch from Stogumber Village 
 to Kingswood 20 different wild flowers
 were recorded in April.
