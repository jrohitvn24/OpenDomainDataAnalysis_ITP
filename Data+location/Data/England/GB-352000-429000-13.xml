		<title>13FULWOOD BARRACKS,PRESTON</title>
		<content>     This is the home of the Queens    
 Lancashire Regiment of the armed      
 forces. There are about 100 soldiers, 
 stationed here and they stop for      
 between two and three years. Most live
 in the married quarters but they join 
 in the life of the local community and
 the children go to local schools. As a
 peace-time garrison the soldiers do   
 not fight but organise supplies and   
 whatever may be needed in an          
 emergency e.g. a strike. In such an   
 event Fulwood Barracks would look     
 after the West of England from        
 Carlisle to South Wales. There is a   
 museum with weapons and uniforms from 
 the Crimean and Boer Wars. There are  
 modern weapons captured during the    
 recent Falklands conflict, the uniform
 of an Argentine soldier and a         
 collection of assorted medals.
