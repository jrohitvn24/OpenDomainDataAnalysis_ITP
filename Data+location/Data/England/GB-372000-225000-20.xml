		<title>20A Newcomer to Newent</title>
		<content> I came to Newent three years ago with 
 my family when my firm moved to       
 Gloucester. I decided to live in      
 Newent because it is such a pleasant  
 part of the country. It is near my    
 work there are good schools and for   
 its size Newent has more facilities   
 than one would expect to find in a    
 community of this size. There is the  
 Sports Centre, Community Centre, many 
 clubs and societies and an extremely  
 good range of shops and services.     
 I find the people very friendly and we
 already feel part of the local scene. 
 There is an added bonus in that one   
 has only to travel a few miles in     
 either direction for a complete       
 scenery change. There is the Forest of
 Dean to the south, Gloucester and the 
 Cotswold Hills to the east and to the 
 west the hills of Wales are within    
 easy reach for a day out.             </content>
