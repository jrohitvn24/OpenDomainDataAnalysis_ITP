		<content> Not far from the top of Park Street is
{Clifton Cathedral.}It is quite a large
 and modern Cathedral unlike {Bristol  
{Cathedral} in the Centre.  At the top 
 of Park Street is the {Cabot Tower}on 
 top of {Brandon Hill}from where you   
 can see the {Bell Tower}which is part 
 of {Bristol University,}the {Council  
{House,}where all the affairs of the   
 local government are sorted out, and  
 the spire of {St. Mary Redcliffe      
{Parish Church.} Going back down the   
 River Avon towards Ashton, you come to
{Bristol City Football Ground} where   
 people come from all over Bristol to  
 watch people playing this sport.  If  
 there are riots when a match is being 
 played, then special armoured riot    
 police are called in.  By following   
 the River Avon you can get to many    
 different places in Bristol.
