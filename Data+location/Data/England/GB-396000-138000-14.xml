		<title>14Mrs Overton of Codford</title>
		<content> Mrs Overton, who is well known in     
 Codford,has lived all her life        
 here.When she was a child she helped  
 her father who worked on a farm.When  
 she was three she started school at   
 St.Peters.Later she went to St.Mary's 
 and then to a school in Salisbury.When
 Mrs Overton left school she became a  
 nurse.She presently works as a        
 clerical assistant at Codford School  
 where she has been for the past eleven
 years.She has seen many changes in her
 time.Where school is there used to be 
 a field which her father owned.The    
 main road is different because when   
 Mrs Overton was a girl she could cross
 the road safely.Almost all of the     
 council houses have been built since  
 she was a girl.
