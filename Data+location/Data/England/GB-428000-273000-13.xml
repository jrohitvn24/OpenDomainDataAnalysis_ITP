		<title>13FOOTBALL HOOLIGANS IN 1985</title>
		<content>I think football hooligans are stupid. 
When one team wins the losing teams    
supporters often get angry and start   
fights. The worst case was in Brussels 
in May 1985 when Liverpool played      
Juventus of Italy in the European Cup  
Final. 38 people died because of the   
rioting. The night before supporters of
both teams shared a camp site and      
played cards together,getting on really
well,but on the day there was trouble  
and a huge brick wall collapsed.Usually
it is not as bad as that. Sometimes    
fans invade the pitch. There are quite 
a few policemen around in case of      
trouble. I am glad to say there is     
hardly any  trouble at the City        
football  ground in Coventry. I hope   
that in years to come the stupidity of 
hooliganism stops.
