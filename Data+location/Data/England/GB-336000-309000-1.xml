		<title>01The Yockleton area.</title>
		<content> This is an area of undulating farmland
 crossed by a railway line and a swift 
 brook once used to turn corn-mills.   
 Farms range from 10 to 500 acres.Most 
 are owned by those who work them:some 
 let a few fields.All rear livestock   
 and grow crops,some use intensive     
 methods.An area of woodland is used   
 for pheasant shooting.                
 Victory Hall,built in 1921 next to the
 school and church is the only meeting 
 place,used by Young Farmers,W.I.,Keep 
 Fit,chapel and church groups and the  
 Rea Board (in charge of drainage in   
 the area).                            
 People in the area have to travel:to  
 Shrewsbury for shops,entertainment,the
 dentist,to board trains:to Westbury to
 see the doctor:to Pontesbury for the  
 secondary school.The nearest policeman
 is at Ford:fire appliances come from  
 Worthen or Shrewsbury.                </content>
