		<title>07ST FAITH'S CHAPEL, FARMCOTE</title>
		<content> The body of this beautiful little     
 chapel is Saxon and fairly early      
 Norman, though the round Saxon apse   
 was destroyed in the early nineteenth 
 century. It has massive windbraces and
 huge cross-beams, still bearing the   
 axe marks of pillagers. It is thought 
 that the Saxon builders of the Chapel 
 made have made use of an earlier,     
 possibly even Roman building. The     
 Chapel has a Norman rectangular nave  
 and a tiny chancel linked to it by a  
 narrow Saxon arch. the chancel houses 
 a Jacobean canopied oak pulpit and    
 arcaded reading desk, oak benches of  
 1597, fine altar rails of the         
 Seventeenth Century and an altar      
 itself of the Fifteenth Century with  
 the original Mensa slab scratched with
 the five crosses, symbolizing the five
 wounds of Christ.
