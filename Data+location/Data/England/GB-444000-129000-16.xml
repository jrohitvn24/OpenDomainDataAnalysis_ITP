		<content> The 750 year old{Great Hall,}once part
 of Winchester Castle, is visited by   
 about 68,000 people a year.It is hired
 out for concerts and exhibitions.The  
{Westgate,}one of two mediaeval city   
 gates still standing, is now a museum.
 Its original function (apart from     
 defence) was as a prison and exhibits 
 include leg irons and prison beds.    
 Other exhibits include weapons, armour
 and an old ceiling. The wall is       
 crumbling destroying inscriptions made
 by prisoners. The{Royal Hampshire     
{Regimental Museum}contains militaria. 
 It is visited by 6500 sight-seers and 
 researchers a year, summer being the  
 busiest. A large number of tourists,  
 many of them from abroad, visit the   
 city area in summer. The shops,       
 streets and car parks get really      
 crowded and many local people avoid   
 going into town as much as possible.  </content>
