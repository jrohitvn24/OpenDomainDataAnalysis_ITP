     The Wychavon Way from Droitwich to
 Winchcombe passes through the area    
 from north to south, near Sheriffs    
 Lench. Efforts are being made by the  
 local farmers to make slight changes  
 in the route, as it passes through    
 good arable land. They wish to        
 change the path so that it follows the
 field boundaries.                     
     One of the spectacular visual     
 interests of each year is blossom time
 in the Vale. Tourists can follow the  
 Blossom Route by car from nearby      
 Harvington ,through Atch Lench,and    
 Church Lench to view the              
 plum,damson and a little later the    
 apple orchards.                       
    Another feature of this area is the
 timber-framed and thatched cottages,  
 which are well preserved.
