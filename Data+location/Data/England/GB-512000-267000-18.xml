		<title>18Birds of Grafham Water.</title>
		<content>   Since the inception of the          
 reservoir, wildlife conservation has  
 been in the forefront of the minds of 
 the planners. Consequently over the   
 years increasing numbers of birds have
 been attracted to the area.           
   A {hide }has been built and a       
 shallow wader scape created.          
   The largest number of {waterfowl}   
 are to be seen between October and    
 December.                             
   During the winter months rarer      
 species such as Divers, Scoters,      
 Scaup, Bewick's Swan and rarer Grebes 
 may be seen.                          
   Away from the water, many species   
 have been recorded by ornithologists  
 who watch the area. These include     
 migrants and winter visitors such as  
 Wheatear, Stonechat, Whinchat and on  
 rare occasions, Osprey, Hobby,Redstart
 and Ring Ouzel.                       </content>
