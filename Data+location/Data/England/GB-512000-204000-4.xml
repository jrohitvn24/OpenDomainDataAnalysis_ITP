		<title>04THE FIGHTING COCKS</title>
		<content>{The Fighting Cocks}is claimed to be   
 the oldest inhabited licensed house in
 England. We think it was originally a 
 fishing lodge for the monks of{St     
{Albans Abbey;}certainly there were    
 fish ponds by the{River Ver,}as the   
 name of the nearby {Fishpool Street}  
 bears witness. The name of the public 
 house is a reminder that there used to
 be a cock pit within its grounds in   
 the days before cock fighting was made
 illegal.{The Fighting Cocks}is now a  
 popular spot with local residents     
 alike, particularly on a summer's     
 evening when the customers overflow on
 to the ideal setting of the bridge    
 over the{River Ver.}
