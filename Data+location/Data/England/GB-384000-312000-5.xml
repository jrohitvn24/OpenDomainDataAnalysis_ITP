village carnival.There were lots of    
floats,there was a castle,liquorice    
allsorts,there was cats and there was  
clowns and some minstrels.At the back  
of the floats was a big whale.One of   
the men in the band was later than he  
should have been so Mr.Thompson our    
headmaster played the big drum.They    
went all round the village and then    
they came to the school field.The      
black and white minstrels won the first
prize.                                 
     I did some countrty dancing and I 
had a go on the lucky dip.I watched the
rounders.Mr.Simpson scored the         
most.Then mummy took me to the Spar for
a lollipop.
