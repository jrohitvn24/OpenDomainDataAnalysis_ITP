		<title>09Lloyds and Midland Bank</title>
		<content> On Friday Clare and I went to Midland 
 bank at 10:30 am and Lloyds at 11:30  
 am.From these interviews we found that
 the people we interviewed both liked  
 working for the community.            
        Both banks used credit         
 cards,and both used Access.There      
 are no cash dispensers in Blockley and
 both banks are open on Mondays and    
 Friday mornings from 10:00 am until   
 12:30 pm.They both have accounts for  
 children.Lloyds has the black horse   
 account and Midland has the Griffin   
 saver account for children.           
        To be a banker you need at     
 least 3 "O"levels being maths ,english
 and one other.
