		<title>11EVENTS 1 BISHOP THORNTON</title>
		<content> The village schoolchildren have been  
 learning about local history and      
 decided to make a Masque about a      
 wedding which took place at the old   
 church in Medieval times. In 1470     
 Robert Castilforde the Chaplain       
 married John Wyttes of Thornton and   
 Margaret, daughter of John Wallworth  
 of Raventoft's Hall. The children made
 up some tunes and dances to fit the   
 music and words to tell the story.    
 They made some masks for the different
 characters some good and others evil. 
 They made the costumes and scenery    
 from their own imagination and with   
 the help of much research from books. 
 The children accompanied the Masque   
 themselves with percussion and        
 recorders and brass instruments. The  
 Masque was performed on 29 July at    
 Bishop Thornton annual feast and also 
 in Fountains Abbey grounds on 4 July  </content>
