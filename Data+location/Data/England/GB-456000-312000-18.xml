{is based at Rolls Royce,}where there  
 is a bungalow used as a weight room,  
 equipment store and meeting place.    
 Facilities at Rolls Royce are used    
 plus the all weather track at         
 Loughborough University, with Bradgate
 Park and The Charnwood Forest being   
 used for longer runs, stamina and     
 endurance training. During its life,  
 the group has expanded considerably,  
 both in numbers and in the activities 
 undertaken. This year the girls' U.13 
 section became the Midland Womens AAA 
 X-Country Champions, and many of the  
 boys represented the track and field  
 team that gained promotion to the     
 Midland Premier Division of The
