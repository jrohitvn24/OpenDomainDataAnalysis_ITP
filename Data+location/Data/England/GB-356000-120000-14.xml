		<title>14ASHINGTON MANOR FARM.</title>
		<content> Ashington Manor Farm consists of 800  
 acres  of land and a manor house built
 in 1485.The farmer keeps 230 fresian  
 cows on 450 acres of arable land.The  
 cows give on average 1,160,000 litres 
 of milk a year.2,500 tonnes of silage 
 is made to feed the cows in winter. A 
 fork on a tractor is used to pick up  
 nearly a tonne of silage at a time    
 which is then fed to the cows.On the  
 rest of his land he grows mainly wheat
 and barley.The wheat is sent to a mill
 to be ground into flour.The barley is 
 used to feed the 140 pigs he keeps to 
 fatten for bacon and pork.As pigs are 
 prone to disease and very sensitive to
 the environment they try hard to keep 
 all animals clean and healthy.When    
 something mechanical breaks they      
 repair it and make their own trailers.
 7 full-time workers and 1 part timer  
 work on the farm.                     </content>
