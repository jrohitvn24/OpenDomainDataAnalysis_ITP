		<content> The character of lower Teesdale has   
 changed drastically over this         
 century.The early years saw a labour  
 intensive agriculture with farmers,   
 farm labourers, blacksmiths and allied
 workers occupying the farm houses and 
 cottages of the area.                 
 Mechanisation of farming means the    
 labour required today is perhaps one  
 third what it was.  Consequently many 
 of the houses are no longer required  
 for their original purpose.  Some have
 fallen into disrepair and are         
 abandoned, others have been sold or   
 let.  Their new occupants are either  
 retired having chosen rural peace for 
 their last years or they commute to   
 work as accountants, dentists, museum 
 curators, local government workers,   
 teachers in Barnard Castle, Richmond, 
 Bishop Auckland and Darlington.
