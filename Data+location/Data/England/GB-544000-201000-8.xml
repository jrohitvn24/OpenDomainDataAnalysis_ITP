		<title>08CENTRAL OFFICES IN EPPING</title>
		<content> Travelling is tiring and time-        
 consuming if you're an officer of     
{Epping Forest District Council}in     
 1985.There are council offices in     
 Loughton,Epping,and Waltham Abbey,and 
 depots in other places.Plans to       
{centralise}in Epping were refused by  
 the Secretary of State in 1982.       
 This year,as a result of an           
 architectural competition,plans have  
 been drawn up to expand offices and   
 centralise in Epping.Some residents   
 in Epping are objecting to the bulky  
 building and have complained.         
{Objections}centre on possible traffic 
 jams and congestion on the B1393.The  
 major advantage of having one central 
 office is in bringing all the Council 
 employees together under one roof.The 
 new offices would mean easier         
{communication}between the people who  
 work there and the people they serve. </content>
