		<title>17FACTS ABOUT LIFE IN WITTON</title>
		<content>   The village of Witton is cut in two 
 by the A47. Witton Church has a  lych 
 gate. The village P.O. is part of     
 somebody's house. There used to  be 3 
 men to do deliveries but now that is  
 done from Blofield.The P.O.house used 
 to be a{toll-house}called the         
 Turnpike.There was a{milestone}outside
 and the tramps would rest there while 
 walking to the{workhouse}at           
 Lingwood.Men going to the{1st World   
{War}went past on route marches and    
 used to stop for some water.The house 
 opposite the P.O. was a pub called    
 "Witton Honest Man"until 1895.There   
 was also a mill on Mill Lane until    
 1900.The man in the P.O.told us his   
 father went to a{"Dame School"}for    
 1d.a week. The P.O.house has a well in
 the garden and they still get water   
 from it.The man could remember when   
 the roads were cart-tracks.           </content>
