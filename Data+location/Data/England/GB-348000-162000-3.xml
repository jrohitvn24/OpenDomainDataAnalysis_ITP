		<title>03Redhill council house sale</title>
		<content>   This year(1985) Woodspring council  
 wanted to buy back two council houses 
 in Redhill which were said to be unfit
 for human habitation.                 
   Woodspring said that the walls were 
 defective and the blockwork crumbling.
   Altogether there were six similar   
 houses,of which four had been sold    
 to tenants.Two of these had been      
 bought back,but the other two owners  
 had extended their houses and were    
 satisfied with them as they were.They 
 therefore refused to sell them back to
 the council.                          
   A compulsory purchase order is to be
 sought so that the whole site can be  
 developed.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
