		<title>07Easington Junior School</title>
		<content> Our school was opened on February 26th
 1914 &amp; is similar to the Infants      
 School opposite. It is one of the     
 biggest buildings in Easington        
 Colliery. There are 321 children &amp; 11 
 classes. On leaving our school you go 
 to Easington Comprehensive.The opening
 of our school in 19l4 was described by
 a local newspaper."The new school     
 which is one of the largest in the    
 district will eventually seat 1700    
 pupils. Separate accomodation is      
 provided for domestic science &amp; manual
 instruction &amp; there is a house for the
 caretaker. The total cost of the      
 building will be Â£20,576 4s 8d or     
 Â£12.2s per pupil. This was thought to 
 be extremely reasonable for the chara-
 cter of the accomodation provided" In 
 1985 the domestic science room was    
 demolished &amp; the caretaker lives off  
 the premises. Recently redecorated.   </content>
