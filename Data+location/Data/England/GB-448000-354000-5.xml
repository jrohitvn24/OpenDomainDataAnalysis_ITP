		<content>    At the Bentinck there is one square
 mile of surface pit.Underground       
 it is five miles each way, and there  
 are seventy miles of tunnels          
 altogether.   There are 930 workers   
 underground and 1231 workers          
 altogether.                           
    Bentinck brings up 300 tons of coal
 a day,45000 tons a month and 2 000 000
 tons a year.   The most coal brought  
 up in a day was 7000 tons.   Fifty    
 coal lorries go out each day but most 
 of the coal travels to power stations 
 on trains.                            
    The pit is named after Cavendish   
 Bentinck.   It was built in 1895.  It 
 has been going 90 years.   There are  
 three shafts at the pit.   They are   
 nearly 600 feet deep.  It is the      
 second biggest pit in Britain.   The  
 onlymajor accident, in 1911, was a    
 shaft accident when 11 men died.      </content>
