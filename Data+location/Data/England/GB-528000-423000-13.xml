{FIR TREE FARM:}There are 5 people     
 employed on this 250 acre farm.  There
 are 4 tractors, 2 ploughs, drags,     
 rotovators, drills, fertiliser spinner
 and sprayer and combine harvester.    
{WILLOW HOUSE FARM:}In addition to the 
 implements listed above on this 280   
 acre site, they have a straw chopper  
 because of the general uproar by the  
 public against stubble burning, which 
 although not as yet banned carries a  
 Â£2000 fine if it gets out of control. 
 Two men are employed.                 
{MANOR FARM:}Three men are employed on 
 the 700 acre farm, having the same    
 implements as above but having 10     
 tractors. A large grain dryer stands  
 in the yard. A communication set links
 the house with the combine, tractor   
 and pick-up truck.                    </content>
