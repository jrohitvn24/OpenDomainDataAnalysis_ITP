		<content> The Lamb Inn is down Barford Road.We  
 visited the pub and we got this       
 information.Darts is a very popular   
 game in the pub called the Lamb       
 Inn.Special matches are played and    
 they raise money for the local youth  
 club.They have a winter match and a   
 summer match, trophies can be         
 won.Skittle matches is another game   
 they play. They have four skittle     
 matches a week. People come from other
 villages to have a drink. They employ 
 people and about twenty people come to
 the pub each night. The people who own
 the pub have been in the village for  
 three years. They sell meals regulary 
 and they hold private parties and     
 sometimes they hold wedding receptions

 meetings. No bed and breakfast trade.
