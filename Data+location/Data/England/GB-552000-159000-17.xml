		<title>17The Amenities of Otford.</title>
		<content>                                       
   The inhabitants of Otford village   
are fortunate in the range of amenities
available. Four churches - Anglican,   
Methodist, Roman Catholic and a Non-   
Conformist Chapel serve the village. A 
medical group practice and a dental    
surgery, as well as a child clinic     
cater for its health; a bank and a sub-
post office provide financial          
facilities and newsagents provide a    
delivered daily paper. There are nine  
food shops and several specialist shops
whilst two restaurants, a cafe and four
public houses provide for the hungry   
and thirsty.                           
   Car parking is difficult with       
limited space but a train service to   
Victoria makes this a commuter area. A 
County library branch, a county Primary
school and two private schools as well 
as playing fields serve the village.   </content>
