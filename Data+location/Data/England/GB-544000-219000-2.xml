		<title>02 FARMING AROUND BURY GREEN</title>
		<content>Around Bury Green hamlet farming is    
mainly arable or mixed.Holdings are    
large.Chief crops are barley,wheat,    
oil-seed rape,potatoes &amp; beans.Hay is  
used for winter fodder.Sheep are kept  
at Butler's Hall &amp; pigs at Bury Green. 
There are some beef cattle  but        
dairying is not important.Growing rape 
is encouraged by the E.E.C.Farming is  
highly mechanised &amp; intensive.Machinery
includes combine harvesters,tractors,  
ploughs,sprayers,harrows,seed-drills &amp; 
rollers.Few workers are necessary      
except during the harvest.             
 Fields are large,bounded by           
hedges,post &amp; wire fences or drainage  
ditches.Some farmers have removed      
hedges to amalgamate fields making it  
easier to manoeuvre machinery.Glaxo    
have an animal research centre with a  
guard at the gate who refused to       
answer any questions.                  </content>
