 Langtree was originally owned by the  
 Earls of Gloucester. After the Norman 
 Conquest the manor was held by        
 Matilda, the wife of William 1. An    
 area known as Castle Gardens marks the
 site of an ancient castle. The church 
 (undedicated) was built in the late   
 15th Century. During the 1500's the   
 parish was owned by the Browne family 
 _wealthy wool merchants who had lived 
 many years in the area. One of the    
 family, Brute Browne, was killed by   
 the Spaniards of Puerto Rico in 1595  
 whilst sailing with Drake.            
 In the early 1600's the manor was     
 purchased by the Rolle Family of      
 Stevenson House, Torrington who       
 remained Lords of the Manor until the 
 beginning of the present century.
