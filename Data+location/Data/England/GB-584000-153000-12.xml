		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE - CONTINUED</title>
		<content> watched a programme on the television 
 and then i had my dinner.             
     My sister Dawn came home and said 
 she was going swimming so i asked my  
 mum if she would take me. She said    
 yes, so i got my swimming things ready
 and my mum drove me to the swimming   
 baths. When we arrived she asked Dawn 
 if she would bring me home and Dawn   
 said yes.                             
     After swimming Dawn brought me    
 home and i had some tea and got ready 
 for bed. I watched television for a   
 little while and then went to bed at  
 nine o'clock.                         
     Tomorrow i will go to school at   
 nine o'clock and begin writing up my  
 account for the school Domesday       
 Project.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
