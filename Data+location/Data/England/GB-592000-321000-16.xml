		<content> Most of the children enjoy watching   
 T.V., reading and  drawing. Building  
 model ships and aircraft and models   
 from Lego are enjoyed by some, while  
 others say that they enjoy playing    
 cards, pool, with Cindy dolls,        
 Action Men and model soldiers.        
                                       
 Outside play includes Swingball,      
 bowls, baseball, volleyball, skipping 
 and building bases.                   
                                       
 On the school playground there is a   
 good surface for roller skating. At   
 playtime people sometimes choose to   
 play games such as football and       
 rounders. Other games include run     
 across, tig, hide and seek and army.
