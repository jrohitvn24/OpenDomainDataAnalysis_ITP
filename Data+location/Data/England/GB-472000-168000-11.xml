		<title>11THE DISTRICT SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Asda superstore employs           
 approximately 500 staff.The store     
 covers 7,200m. square. The car park   
 holds 650 cars.Most people who shop   
 there are within 15mins. driving time 
 away from the store. Around 25,000    
 customers shop there every week. We   
 interviewed people who had been       
 shopping at Asda and we found that    
 most of them preferred Asda to other  
 shops because of the convenience. They
 could park their cars there and       
 everything is under one roof and      
 prices are generally cheaper.Other    
 shops at the centre include a         
 newsagents, shoe shop, hair dressers, 
 chemist, ice-cream bar, Roomsets      
 Kitchen, Building Society, Post       
 Office and the Midland Bank.
