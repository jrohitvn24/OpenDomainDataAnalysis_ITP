		<title>05A Stock Farm in Taddington</title>
		<content>     My father runs three farms as one 
 unit;Beech Farm with 60 acres,Fold    
 Farm with 100 and the rented 220 acres
 of Overwheal Farm.He has a herd of 100
 Charolais and Hereford beef cattle    
 which are kept inside from November to
 April and then fed on big bale silage,
 only the calves having feeding nuts as
 well.In the summer they eat only fresh
 grass.Stock are taken to Bakewell     
 Market during the Autumn. He also has 
 a flock of 290 ewes and 10 rams,mainly
 Mules and Suffolks with 500 lambs.    
 These are kept outside all the time.  
 Six weeks before lambing begins in    
 April the ewes are fed corn.The newly 
 lambed ewes are kept indoors for a few
 days until the lambs are strong enough
 to run with the flock.During the      
 summer they are fattened on grass and 
 sold during the Autumn again mainly at
 Bakewell Market.                      </content>
