		<content> This covers much of Shooters          
 Hill,which is the highest point in    
 south-east London.It has been there   
 for 9000 years.There are 3907 acres of
 woods but it used to cover 80 square  
 miles.                                
 About 5000 people each week use the   
 woods and open spaces to walk the dog,
 or to have a picnic.                  
 There are many species of fauna,like  
 mole,hedgehog,shrew,rabbit,fox and    
 grey squirrel.The woods are mostly    
 oak,ash,beech,chestnut,but it has the 
 rare wild service tree,which is one of
 the biggest in Britain.The woods are  
 coppiced to encourage new growth and  
 undergrowth which will attract more   
 creatures.                            
 There is a very popular nature trail  
 and orienteering course set out       
 through the woods.
