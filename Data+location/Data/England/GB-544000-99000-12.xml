		<title>12NEWHAVEN: IN AND OUT BY SEA</title>
		<content> There are two forms of sea transport. 
 The ferry service, operated by        
 S.N.C.F.(French Railways), runs from  
 Newhaven to Dieppe.  In summer, there 
 are up to six crossings per day while 
 in winter, only two.  The crossing    
 time is about four hours.  Four boats 
 provide this service - Chartres,      
 Senlac, Cornouaillies and Valancay.   
 These transport both passengers and   
 vehicles, the latter by the "Ro-Ro"   
 method.  The port also caters for     
 cargo boats.  The major imported      
 cargoes by weight are sand, ballast   
 and roadstone. Vessels carrying this  
 cargo dock on the North Quay but some 
 discharge on the East and West quays. 
 Fruit and vegetables are the other    
 major cargoes brought into Newhaven.  
 The major exports by weight are       
 manufactured articles and scrap       
 metals.                               </content>
