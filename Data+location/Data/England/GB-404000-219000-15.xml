		<title>15SALPERTON'S OLDEST PERSON</title>
		<content> The oldest inhabitant,the last        
 survivor of a Salperton family, is a  
 spry 80-year-old with thick white     
 hair.She spent her school days at the 
 village school (a building recently   
 demolished ) and was postmistress in  
 days when Salperton had shops and a   
 bus service to Cheltenham.Although    
 outwardly cheerful she admits to      
 feeling depressed .Friends invite her 
 to meals .She takes a housebound      
 pensioner's dog for daily walks. She  
 belongs to the Shipton Oliffe Women's 
 Institute and the Golden Link.Once a  
 week she is driven to a day centre and
 once a week to the shops in           
 Cheltenham.A busy day gives her       
 something to think about during the   
 long, lonely evenings.
