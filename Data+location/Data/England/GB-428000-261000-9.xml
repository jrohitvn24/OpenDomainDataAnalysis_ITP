      The general character of the land
 in this area is flat or gently        
 undulating.The land is used mostly for
 crop-growing,the soil being a workable
 clay mixture.Most of the farmland is  
 owned by a few landowners and there   
 are also a number of tenant farmers.  
      Because of the few landowners    
 owning most of the land there are     
 quite a few farmhouses that are let   
 privately and take no part in the     
 farming of the surrounding land.      
      Also a large proportion of the{  
{Castle Grounds}is used as tenanted    
 farmland.                             
    In the south-western section of the
  grid,land is being used increasingly 
 for extractive purposes, such as      
 gravel,sand and clay.
