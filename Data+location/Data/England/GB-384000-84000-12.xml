		<title>12Wool Village...1940 to 1942</title>
		<content> In May 1940 my husband was stationed  
 at Bovington Camp and I came to Wool  
 to be with him. We rented a bed-sit in
 a converted wooden shed at The Poplars
 in Spring Street.                     
 In April 1941 there were some bombs   
 dropped behind the Dorchester Road,   
 killing a lady in Bailey's Drove and  
 damaging bungalows.There were craters 
 left in the field behind.             
 All the traffic to Bovington had to go
 over the ancient Wool Bridge,as there 
 was no other road then.The stonework  
 of the bridge was being damaged by    
 Tanks so the stones were removed into 
 a field nearby and replaced by metal  
 bars.They were numbered as they were  
 removed so that it was possible after 
 the war to rebuild the stone wall just
 as it was before.This was arranged by 
 Mr.Hyde of Manor Farm.  We left Wool  
 in 1942 and returned in 1945.(D.Angus)</content>
