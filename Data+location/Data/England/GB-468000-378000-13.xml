		<content> THE COLLEGE CLOSED IN 1980 AS A RESULT
 OF A CUTBACK IN EDUCATION SPENDING.THE
 COLLEGE WAS LATER RE-OPENED AS EATON  
 HALL INTERNATIONAL,A LANGUAGE SCHOOL  
 FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS.NOW WE CAN SEE   
 PEOPLE OF MANY DIFFERENT RACES WALKING
 ABOUT THE TOWN WHO ATTEND THE COLLEGE 
 TO LEARN ENGLISH.IT IS INTERESTING TO 
 NOTE THAT MR.E.L.ABLESON A PRINCIPAL  
 AT THE COLLEGE FROM 1962 TO 1972      
 TOLD US THAT IT STANDS WHERE THE OLD  
 MANOR HOUSE OF THE VILLAGE HAS STOOD  
 SINCE THE FIRST{DOMESDAY BOOK}WAS     
 WRITTEN AND THAT THE GROUNDS HAVE     
 CHANGED VERY LITTLE IN EXTENT SINCE   
 1326.                                 
{DWELLINGS}IN 1871 THERE WERE FOURTY   
 SEVEN DWELLINGS IN THE VILLAGE OF     
 EATON,TODAY WE COUNTED THIRTY.THIS IS 
 BECAUSE MANY OF THE OLDER COTTAGES    
 HAVE BEEN KNOCKED INTO ONE TO FORM    
 LARGER DWELLING HOUSES.               </content>
