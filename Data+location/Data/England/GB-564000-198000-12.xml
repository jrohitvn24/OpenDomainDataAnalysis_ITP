		<content> The area forms part of two            
 parliamentary constituencies.         
                                       
 Ingatestone is part of Brentwood and  
 Ongar constituency currently held by  
 the Conservatives while the area to   
 the west of the River Wid is part of  
 Chelmsford constituency. Chelmsford is
 held by the Conservatives but at the  
 last election had only a very slender 
 majority over the Liberals.           
                                       
 For the purposes of direct elections  
 to the European parliament the whole  
 block lies within the Essex South-west
 constituency and this seat is again   
 held by a Conservative.
