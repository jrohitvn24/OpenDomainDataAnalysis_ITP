		<title>04The village shop , Sandridge</title>
		<content> Darby's store is the one remaining    
 foodstore in Sandridge.The main       
 competition is from mobile vans which 
 sell things like fish, fruit, eggs    
 and veg.The store opens at 7.15 am and
 closes at 5.30 pm.Wednesday is early  
 closing day.The shop closes for       
 lunch. The shopkeeper has one full    
 time and one part time assistant. The 
 land was first owned by the Duke of   
 Marlborough and the shop keeper has   
 the original charter which was signed 
 by the Duke in 1721. Customers come   
 from outside Sandridge as the shop is 
 on the main road.They do not do their 
 large shopping at Darby's but get     
 things that they have forgotten from  
 the supermarket.Darby's prices differ 
 very little from the supermarkets but 
 they offer less choice and have no    
 parking facilities..
