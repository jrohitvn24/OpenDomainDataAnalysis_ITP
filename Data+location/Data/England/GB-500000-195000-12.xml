		<title>12Chorleywood -  Local News</title>
		<content>There are six different local papers   
which include Chorleywood within their 
area. The two main stories for the last
week of June 1985 were:-Â£A decision on 
the abolition of Corporal Punishment in
Hertfordshire schools will be made at  
Monday's meeting of the Education      
Committee'.                            
Secondly, was a sad headline, Â£VILLAGE 
GARAGE OUT OF BUSINESS. Too many       
dealers and not enough customers were  
the reasons given for the sudden       
closure of a Chorleywood garage which  
had operated in the village for 30     
years'.                                
There are a lot of other interesting   
stories of local societies and people  
reported in the local papers, half of  
which are free and distributed         
throughout the village.
