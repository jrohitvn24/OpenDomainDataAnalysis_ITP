		<content>In common with many others in Devon,   
the people of the area rely heavily on 
the motor car for getting to work,     
school, shopping, or for visiting.     
Secondary school pupils attending Queen
Elizabeth School in Crediton do have   
free transport provided by the County  
Council and Mid Devon Buses, but the   
bus  taking primary school pupils to   
Lapford   was withdrawn as an economy  
measure in July 1985, leaving them in  
the same unfortunate situation as those
attending Bow School. This has led to  
an increase in traffic in the lanes, it
being unrealistic to expect children to
walk the three miles along them twice  
daily.                                 
Bow Belle Buses provide a service into 
Exeter, via Crediton, once a week on   
Fridays and, although not heavily used,
is essential to those with no other    
means of transport.                    </content>
