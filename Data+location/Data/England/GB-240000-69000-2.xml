		<title>02Survey Results-Tamar Valley</title>
		<content>        Of  261  people  intervewed  in
 our area 27% have lived here all their
 lives and  43% for less than 10 years.
 Most came from  within a 100 kilometre
 radius  and  5  came from abroad. They
 came to live here for work, to retire,
 for the beautiful countryside or to be
 near relatives. Occupations range from
 farming  to  electronics  engineering.
 Many are Naval  personnel.  31.5% work
 in the area, 42.5% in Plymouth and 26%
 elsewhere.                            
       The main shopping town  seems to
 be Tavistock  and  others shop locally
 and   in   Plymouth,   Callington   or
 Launceston.  Hobbies  range from quiet
 activities like gardening to sport and
 Do-It-Yourself jobs  around the house.
 When interviewing the  public we found
 that half of those we called  on  were
 out, probably at work, and 14.3%  were
 unemployed.                           </content>
