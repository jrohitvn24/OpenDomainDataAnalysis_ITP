		<content>  The map names 8 outlying farms. There
 are also Home and Wyddial Bury Farms  
 in the village. North End Farm        
 Beauchamps and Moles are private      
 houses with an acre or two of land    
 still attached. New Barns in the east 
 has farmbuildings but no house. It is 
 worked as part of a farm in Anstey.   
  Silkmead was a poultry farm. Within  
 the last 5 years the buildings have   
 been converted for light industry.    
 Racing stables occupy most of the     
 Holding.                              
  Cave Gate buildings are workshops for
 an agricultural engineer. All the land
 formerly attached to these has been   
 amalgamated into larger units. Only   
 three_ Biggin Manor, Wyddial Bury and 
 Home Farms are still working farms.   
  Some tied cottages no longer needed  
 for farm workers have been sold off.
