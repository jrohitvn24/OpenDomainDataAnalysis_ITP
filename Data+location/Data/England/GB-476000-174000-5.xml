		<title>05Main Features in Twyford</title>
		<content> One of the main features of Twyford is
 the mill. The mill is called B.B.O.   
 This stands for Berks,Bucks and Oxon. 
 The farmers make animal food. It is   
 run as a co-operative society which   
 means that it is run by a group of    
 farmers working together. Old records 
 have shown that there was a mill on   
 the banks of the Loddon river in      
 1163. It is 1976 that most people will
 remember because on the third of      
 October the mill was set on fire and  
 totally destroyed.  The mill was      
 rebuilt in 1979 and it is one of the  
 most modern mills in the country. Some
 more of the main features in Twyford  
 are Bridge House, the Old Farmhouse,  
 quite a few pubs and the Almshouses.  
 The Almshouses used to be a           
 courthouse. Then they were turned into
 a library. Now it is used for old     
 people to live in.                    </content>
