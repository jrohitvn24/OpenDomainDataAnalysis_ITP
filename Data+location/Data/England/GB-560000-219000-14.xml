		<title>14Public Houses in Dunmow</title>
		<content>   The Great Dunmow area has a wide    
 variety of country public houses,     
 which form the main socialising point 
 for most people of the 17 years and   
 over.                                 
   Alcohol served in public houses     
 forms 80% of all drink sales.  The    
 restrictions on serving alcoholic     
 drinks allow only persons of 18 years 
 and over to be served.                
   Prices for the popular pint of beer 
 range from 75 - 85p, lunches from 50p 
 to Â£2.50, depending on the size of the
 placed order.                         
   All the public houses within Great  
 Dunmow also serve light lunches,      
 usually between 12 and 2 o'clock.     
 Most popular amongst these is a       
 ploughman's lunch, followed by a      
 various range of sandwiches and rolls.
   People also take part in pool,      
 snooker, darts, or dominoes.          </content>
