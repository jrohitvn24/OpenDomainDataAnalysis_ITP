 denominations in the squares ref. 5030
 and 4931.They are St.Peter &amp; St. Paul,
 St.Bernards, St. Barnabas, and Holy   
 Family, all Roman Catholic. St.       
 Andrews, St.Davids, St.Margarets and  
 St. Christophers which are all Church 
 of England and Lea Methodist. Most of 
 these are involved in more than just  
 the worship of God. Most support      
 organisation such as the Church Lads  
 and Church Girls Brigade,             
 Brownies,Girl Guides, Scouts and      
 Mothers' Union. Of church going       
 families most attend the local church 
 although a fair proportion,           
 approximately 15 per cent, go to      
 worship outside the area retaining    
 links with their original parish (e.g.
 in Preston) before moving to live in  
 Lea/ Ashton area.
