		<title>02Knutton - a local history</title>
		<content>Knutton was mentioned in the           
first Domesday Book,unlike the later   
Norman   town of Newcastle-Under-Lyme  
into which it has now become absorbed. 
It more recently had a long industrial 
history,and there is still much        
derelict land around the village.      
Since the 1930s,as the forge and pits  
have gone,it has grown into a          
residential village.                   
                                       
The village centre still consists of   
streets of pre-1914 terraced           
housing,but it is now surrounded by a  
large expanse of modern council houses 
with large gardens,and some private    
housing.                               
There is much open space around Knutton
and on the 600 foot hills on either    
side but this may disappear if the     
Coal Board is allowed to use all       
the land for long-term opencast mining.</content>
