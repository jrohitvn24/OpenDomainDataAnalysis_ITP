		<title>15THE CATTLE MART 1/2</title>
		<content> The cattle market (mart) in Tow Law   
 has been in existence since 1882, when
 it was founded by Joseph Vickers, a   
 local farmer.                         
                                       
 Since then four generations of the    
 Vicars' family have run the mart; the 
 present Managing Director is Mr Harry 
 Vicars.                               
                                       
 The sales,mainly of cattle and sheep, 
  are held fortnightly, especially     
 during Spring and Autumn.             
                                       
 Farmers from miles around attend      
 the sales either to sell, buy or just 
 keep in touch with the latest prices  
 and with friends.                     
                                       
 The order of sale is decided by "lot" 
 as a good or bad turn can make a big  
 difference to the farmer's profits.   </content>
