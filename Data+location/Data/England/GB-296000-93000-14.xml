 There is a  main road splitting the   
 village into two parts.The other part 
 is a lane called Blackhorse Lane.The  
 school is one of the main features of 
 the village,sited in the middle.Next  
 to the school there is a Church Hall. 
 The church which is opposite the      
 school is 700 years old and it is the 
 oldest building in the village.Next to
 the church there is  a house called   
 Clyst House. It takes up a large area 
 of land.Alongside the A30 there are   
 two pubs and a post office.The post   
 office sells sweets,cards,etc,and     
 includes a sorting office which serves
 five villages around Clyst Honiton.
