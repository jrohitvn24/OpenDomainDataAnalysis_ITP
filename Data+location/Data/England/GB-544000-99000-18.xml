		<title>18ARTS AND CRAFTS IN NEWHAVEN</title>
		<content> Arts and crafts are popular in        
 Newhaven: the majority of students at 
 the Adult Education Centre take these 
 courses.  Local schools teach art and 
 pottery.  Joan Dove, a potter who     
 teaches at the Education Centre,      
 believes that teapots are the most    
 saleable items of local pottery,      
 although she also produces glazed     
 pots, mugs and enamelled necklaces.   
 Myrta Fisher, a professional artist   
 and teacher, who often exhibits       
 locally, finds that although she      
 paints a variety of subjects the local
 favourites are landscapes.  Miss      
 Fisher favours the use of watercolours
 rather than oils, following the       
 tradition of this area, which has been
 renowned for watercolourists since the
 early eighteenth century.  Crafts     
 practised include macrame, embroidery,
 crochet and the making of corn dollies</content>
