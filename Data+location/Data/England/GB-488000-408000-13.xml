 motor cycle display: all done by the

  Each year a famous personality makes 
 a personal appearance. For the last   
 eight years it has been a{TV          
 personality and this year it was Jon  
 Pertwee (Worzel Gummidge) and Don     
 Estell.                               
   Family weekend is very popular and  
 makes a good two days out for anyone.
