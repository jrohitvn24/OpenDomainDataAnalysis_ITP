		<content> The house in Poulter Park was built in
 Edwardian times. It was built by the  
 Poulter family and they lived in it   
 through two world wars.               
  The park was established in 1911 and 
 in 1928 the estate of twenty acres was
 bought as a public open space by the  
 London and Greater London Playing     
 Field Association. The trustees of    
 Reginald Clifford Puolter gave Â£5000  
 towards the purchase.                 
 The Carshalton Urban District Council 
 has undertaken to maintain it as a    
 public open space for ever.           
 Woodcote House at Wrythe Green is     
 thought to have been the former       
 Rosehill Toll house.It is constructed 
 from wooden boarding which is laid in 
 a herring-bone pattern.It had a fine  
 weather vane on the roof,dated 1745,  
 which has been presented to the       
 Victorian and Albert Museum.          </content>
