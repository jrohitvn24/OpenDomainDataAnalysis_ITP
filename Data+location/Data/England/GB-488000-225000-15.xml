		<title>15Housing in Soulbury</title>
		<content> There are approximately 210 houses in 
 the Soulbury area, nearly all of which
 are one family units. The majority are
 privately owned, each with varying    
 areas of land and garden attached.    
 There are approximately 60 council    
 houses owned by Aylesbury Vale        
 District Council which are rented to  
 families on a points allocation       
 system. There are between 15 and 20   
 farmhouses occupied by the families   
 operating the farmland although some  
 farmhouses have been sold off as farms
 have been amalgamated. Houses of      
 historic architectural interest       
 were listed and recorded by a survey  
 conducted and updated in 1984.        
 These properties  are now protected   
 from demolition and structural        
 alterations. Planning permission for  
 development and new houses has to be  
 authorised by the Parish council.     </content>
