		<title>19THE BETHANY FELLOWSHIP</title>
		<content> The Bethany Fellowship is a group     
 of Christians.They have daily worship 
 every morning and almost every        
 night.They have most meetings in      
 Roffey Place and some in the Hyde.We  
 meet on a Sunday at Roffey Place.At   
 Christmas,sometimes we have dinner    
 there.About 10-12 people live in the  
 Hyde.The Hyde itself was built in the 
 17th century.The Warren family have   
 loaned it to the Fellowship for 10    
 years.They have 1000 acres.They       
 have lovely gardens and 3 lakes.Every 
 3 weeks groups of people come and stay
 at the Hyde.They are called leaders.  
 Roffey Place is a Christian College   
 where young single people and families
 come and learn more about God.There   
 are 4 main preachers and a few other  
 partime ones.In the Summer we go to a 
 Christian Camp at Newark showground.  
 About 2000-3000 people attend.        </content>
