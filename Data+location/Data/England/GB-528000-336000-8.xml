		<title>08Primary School - Kirton</title>
		<content> Kirton has a large primary school     
 which was built in 1974, the official 
 opening took place on March 25th      
 1975.The new building replaced the old
 all-age school which had opened in    
 1880.                                 
    Children come to our school when   
 they are 5years old and stay until    
 they are 11years old.Many come by bus 
 and car from country-side round Kirton
 and most children bring their lunch to
 school. There are over 4OO pupils at  
 our school and 15 teachers including  
 our Headteacher Mr. G.K. Ball.        
    We have a swimming pool and a large
 playing field, also lots of lawns and 
 gardens round school.                 
    Our school uniform is blue and     
 grey and our badge has a sheaf of corn
 on it because we are a country school.
