		<content> which can lead to serious flooding.In 
 the great flood of November 17,1770   
 the Shropshire half of Teme Bridge as 
 then existing was carried away;or at  
 least it was much damaged.The bridge  
 was then rebuilt by Thomas Telford the
 famous engineer.He was appointed      
 County Surveyor of Shropshire in 1787.
  Another great flood of 1946 swept    
 right up Teme Street to about the     
 Corner Shop which is a shop just at   
 the end of Market Street and the start
 of Teme Street.                       
  Last year (1984) JCBs and other      
 diggers went down to the Teme to try  
 and make the water go through all the 
 arches of the Teme Bridge and three or
 four months later they succeeded in   
 doing this.                           
  This year (1985) we have had a lot of
 rain and the Teme is very high and    
 fast flowing in Tenbury Wells.        </content>
