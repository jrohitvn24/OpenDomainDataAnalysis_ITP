		<content> MY DAD RACES PIGEONS. BEFORE THEY GO  
 INTO A RACE THEY HAVE TO BE SPRAYED   
 WITH SPECIAL CHEMICALS. WHEN THE      
 BASKETS HAVE BEEN SPRAYED AND         
 PRECLEANED, THE PIGEONS ARE PUT INTO  
 THEM. THEY ARE TAKEN TO A PIGEON CLUB,
 WHERE THEY HAVE RINGS PUT ROUND THEIR 
 LEGS. THE PIGEON OFFICERS WRITE THE   
 NUMBERS DOWN IN A BOOK. THE PIGEONS   
 ARE TAKEN TO WHERE THEY'RE RACING FROM
 AND LET OUT. WE HAVE A SPECIAL CLOCK  
 WHICH TIMES THEM. WHEN THEY GET BACK  
 TO THE CREE WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL     
 THEIR HOUSE, WE TAKE THE RUBBER RING  
 OFF AND PUT IT IN THE TOP OF THE      
 CLOCK.YOU HAVE TO TURN A KEY AND THE  
 CLOCK SETS A TIME. IF YOU WIN YOUR    
 PRIZE IS A CERTIFICATE AND YOU COULD  
 WIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO HELP  
 THEM FLY YOU HAVE TO FEED THEM ON A   
 SPECIAL DIET OF PIGEON CORN WITH      
 BEANS, RAPE SEED AND PELLETS A. DUNN. </content>
