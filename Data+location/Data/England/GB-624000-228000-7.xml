		<title>07Simon's Weekend - Saturday</title>
		<content> I live with my Mum and Dad and two    
 cats called Ming and Chin. My sister  
 lives in San Francisco.               
  On Saturday I woke up at 6.30 am.I   
 watched children's television and then
 had pancakes and maple syrup followed 
 by bacon and eggs for breakfast. We   
 all went shopping in Dovercourt. We   
 went to the library to borrow some    
 books as well as buying food. For     
 lunch I cooked grilled cheese         
 sandwiches supervised by Daddy. After 
 lunch my friend Daniel came to play.We
 rode our bikes and played with my     
 train set in the loft. Mummy planted  
 out some seeds and Daddy watched some 
 sport on T.V.                         
  At 6pm. we had dinner which was      
 beefburgers,new potatoes,broccoli and 
 leeks. I went to bed at 8pm after     
 Daddy read me a story.
