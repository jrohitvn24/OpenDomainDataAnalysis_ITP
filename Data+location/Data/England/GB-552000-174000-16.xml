		<title>16  TEMPLE HILL ESTATE</title>
		<content>Temple Hill is a well planned estate   
and was built between 1952-1960.       
It consists of grassed areas, shops    
two public houses, three primary       
schools and three churches.  The estate
is situated near the river Thames, with
views across the river to Essex.       
Most of the buildings on the estate are
masionettes and terraced houses.  There
are many activites such as, play       
schemes, youth clubs and leisure       
groups.  Another new estate being built
at the top of Temple Hill is Knights   
Manor.  This estate gets its name from 
knights that lived there long ago      
called Knights Templar, and was then   
farm land.  It is now becoming a very  
pleasant estate with little terrace    
houses around square gardens.
