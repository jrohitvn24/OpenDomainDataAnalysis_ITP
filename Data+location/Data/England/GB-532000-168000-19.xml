		<content>   The type of flats at Northwood Court
 Rigina Rd. are becoming more popular  
 as the occupants are more independent.
 The flats are a fair size, they have a
 kitchenette, a bathroom, and bedroom. 
 All the flats are equipped with an    
 emergency cord when help is needed. A 
 light then flashes in the warden's    
 office telling her that help is needed
 in a flat. Several of the flats have  
 been specially designed to cater for  
 disabled people to make their a little
 easier. For instance they have a wide 
 door frame, open plan kitchen, all the
 cupboards and sink in the kitchen are 
 at low level so that someone in a     
 wheel chair would be able to manage.  
 The handles on doors and light        
 switches are also at a convenient     
 level. Their are ramps from room to   
 room and other aids to accomodate     
 people in wheel chairs.               </content>
