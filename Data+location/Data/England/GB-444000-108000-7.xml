		<content>   Netley on the shore of Southampton  
 Water sits in between West Wood and   
 Victoria Country Park.Just down from  
 Netley Abbey,on the shore,is Netley   
 Castle built by Henry V111 to protect 
 the waterway.Netley Catle is now used 
 as a Convalescent Home for people from
 the Southampton area.The Abbey was    
 disolved by Henry and some of the     
 stones were used to build the Castle. 
 Legend has it though that the foreman 
 was killed by a falling stone and the 
 men refused to work there any more    
 that's why so much of the ruin        
 remains.                              
   After World War 2 a large{Council   
{Estate}was built here.These houses are
 now being modernised.                 
   The shopping area along the shore   
 has a number of shops and restaurants 
 to cater for the boating enthusiasts  
 during the summer.                    </content>
