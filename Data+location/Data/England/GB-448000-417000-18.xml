		<title>18EATING OUT IN WENTBRIDGE.</title>
		<content>     A few weeks ago, as part of this  
 survey, the three 4th. year children  
 and three of the 3rd. year children   
 from East Hardwick Cawood's J.&amp;I.     
 School interviewed the managers of the
 Wentbridge Hotel, Swiss Cottage       
 Restaurant and the Blue Bell Inn.     
     Having  seen all the delicious    
 food, the 4th years decided to ask if 
 we could have a meal at one of them   
 for our leaving treat from school. It 
 was arranged that we would go to the  
 Swiss Cottage. We were treated as very
 special guests. Here is our menu.     
 Starters: Melon (1 plain, 1 with      
 blackcurrant sorbet) Prawn Cocktail.  
 Main Course: Fillet Steak, mushrooms, 
 chips and onion rings.                
 Sweet: Blackcurrant Cheesecake, Peach 
 Charlotte and Chocolate Pavlova.      
   We all enjoyed our meal very much.  
 We explored the gardens before leaving</content>
