		<title>11Changing Times.</title>
		<content>  The greatest change in the last 30   
 years has been the result of growing  
 population and increased wealth.Large 
 housing estates,private and municipal 
 have surrounded the old town whilst   
 many of the medieval buildings have   
 been demolished.The car has prompted  
 the building of big car parks;shopping
 habits have changed from small local  
 shops to big supermarkets &amp; multiples 
 whilst the extension of the outside   
 market to Wednesday as well,has been  
 welcomed.This was helped by the       
 pedestrian precinct in the town centre
 being formed so that the stalls went  
 back to their original place in the   
 road.With the increase in spare time &amp;
 the proliferation of T.V.s has come a 
 change in leisure activities.Cinemas  
 have closed or changed to bingo       
 clubs,whilst societies and amenity    
 groups have increased.                </content>
