		<title>10WILDERHOPE MANOR</title>
		<content> In a commanding position overlooking  
 Hope Dale,a remote and unspoiled      
 Shropshire valley,Wilderhope Manor has
 stood the test of time,and looks much 
 as it did when first built in the late
 1500's.Wilderhope is built of the     
 local Aymestry limestone,though the   
 tall chimney stacks,which are so      
 notable a feature of its silouette    
 seen from across the valley,are of    
 beautifully executed brickwork.The    
 house was carefully restored in the   
 1930's by the National Trust and is   
 now a bustling  Youth Hostel;an       
 historic setting for modern activities
 There was another restoration         
 programme in 1975 and this again did  
 not alter the character of the house. 
 It remains the most imposing building 
 in the area,full of interesting       
 architectural details and tales of the
 past.                                 </content>
