		<content>  The cows are all{Hereford cross      
{Fresian}they are used for beef.The    
 bull is a{Charolais}used for beef     
 breeding.When the cattle are          
 slaughtered to make beef the          
 bones,hooves and horns are used for   
 glue and fertilizer.The blood is dried
 and used to make fertilizer.When the  
 calves are born,which is in           
 February,March and April they are kept
 and fed well for a year and then sold 
 for beef.                             
  The reason the cattle are kept on the
 right side of the road is because this
 is the land nearest the river and     
 floods easily.The ground is also      
 mostly gravel and not that good for   
 growing crops.
