		<title>15HIGH PARK ESTATE.</title>
		<content>  The approach to{High Park Estate}is  
 via a dirt drive lined with a variety 
 of trees including a number of beech, 
 sycamore, laurel, oak and mountain    
 ash. There are rhododendron bushes too
 which were evidently planted when the 
 house was built around 1900. Half way 
 up the drive there is a caravan site, 
 the{caravans}being used as permanent  
 homes. At the end of the road stands  
 the large house now divided into{flats
 and in need of some attention. Near to
 it are some disused farm buildings, an
 empty pond and a modern{bungalow.     
  Originally the surrounding land      
 belonged to High Park House but the   
 fields are now used for hay and       
 grazing. What was once the deer park  
 is now used for sheep.                
  Some{St. Mark's}children visited this
 former estate in June 1985.
