		<title>03Farming in Dargate and Blean</title>
		<content> Only a small proportion of our square 
 is farmland, the farms are small,     
 ranging from 50-l70 acres             
 concentrating mainly on producing     
 meat.  The areas suitable for         
 agriculture are undulating strips of  
 land dividing large areas of dense    
 woodland- 'fingers' of land with      
 woodland boundaries on three sides    
 which are all permanant pasture grazed
 by beef cattle, sheep and lambs.      
 The one open area is towards the NW   
 corner where larger fields allow corn 
 and tick beans for fodder to be grown.
 There are two areas of orchards, both 
 to the north of our square, in the NW 
 at Dargate apples are grown and       
 further east at Parsonage Farm 100    
 acres are planted with apples, pears  
 and plums with a southern boundary of 
 woodland.                             
                                       </content>
