		<title>03Social Concern in Maylandsea</title>
		<content> There is considerable concern in the  
 area on a number of counts.           
{The roads in Maylandsea}have until    
 recently been in a parlous condition .
 Well attended public meetings have    
 been held for over 15 years- now some 
 are being brought up to standard but  
 others are to be left unadopted.      
 The locals feel there is a need for a 
{school}in the are as many young       
 children have to travel to ,the       
 nearest schools early in the morning. 
 The council will not act until there  
 are sufficient numbers of children    
 actually in the area                  
 There are insufficient facilities for 
 the proposed large increase in        
 housing.Specifically the lack of a    
{village green}is deplored. 7 - 8 years
 ago the area so used was sold to a    
 yacht club and the only facility left 
 is a public right of way.             </content>
