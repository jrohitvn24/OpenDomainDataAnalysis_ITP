		<title>19A Day in the Life of Laila</title>
		<content> At 7.00am my sister wakes me. I do    
 exercises then I wash, get ready for  
 school, make my bed and then go down  
 for breakfast. I walk to school and   
 meet some friends on the way. At      
 school I have recorder practice first.
 We have assembly before lessons in    
 Maths or English. At playtime I spend 
 my time talking to my friends or      
 playing with our sponge-ball. Dinner  
 time is at 11.55 and afterwards we    
 have general work such as History,    
 Geography, Science, R.E. or Art.      
 School finishes at 3.30pm. After      
 school I spend my time watching       
 television, practising Maths or       
 English or playing out. After tea at  
 6.00pm I read or crochet. I go to bed 
 at 9.30pm, read for an hour, then I   
 fall asleep.
