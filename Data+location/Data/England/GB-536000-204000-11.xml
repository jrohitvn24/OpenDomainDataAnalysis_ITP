		<title>11Lea Valley Park</title>
		<content> Part of the Lea Valley Park runs      
 through our area - some two miles of  
 the total twenty-three miles that run 
 from Ware, in Hertfordshire from      
 London's East End.                    
 The park, established in 1967, was    
 developed to meet the ever increasing 
 leisure needs of London, Hertfordshire
 and Essex. In our area, the Lido      
 complex offers a variety of activities
 from journeying on a river bus to     
 swimming; from fishing to walking; as 
 well as the opportunity to hire our   
 the riverside holiday chalets.        
 At Broxbourne Boat Centre rowing boats
 and motor boats for hourly hire are   
 available. The fifty-two seater 'Pride
 of Lee' provides river trips          
 throughout the summer as well as being
 available for private hire
