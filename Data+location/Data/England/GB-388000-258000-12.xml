		<title>12CANAL LIFE IN WORCESTERSHIRE</title>
		<content>    Canal life is an important part of 
 the canal.The canal forms the base of 
 the{community}life. It encourages     
{sports}such as canoeing,boating,      
 fishing and also walking. There are   
 many types of fish such as Bream,     
 Roach,Pike.This water is excellent for
 placid water canoeing and very good   
 for marathon training. Boating is very
 pleasant, because of the abundance of 
 flora and fauna. There are many       
 species of animals e.g. Voles,Rabbits,
 Mice,and many birds which live near   
 the waterside. One hundred and        
 fifty years ago the canal was a hive  
 of activity with barges carrying      
 coal,iron,grain and other goods       
 between Worcester and Birmingham.Today
 the only activity is from leisure     
 craft,fishermen and walkers as they   
 enjoy the peaceful scenery.
