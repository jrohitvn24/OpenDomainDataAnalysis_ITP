		<title>06Mr. Bullimore's Memories.</title>
		<content>{Alfred Bullimore}came to our Coffee   
 Morning. Mr. Bullimore is 81 and he   
 was born in Seaton Delaval. He has    
 lived in Newcastle and in London.     
 Before he left the area, he used to   
 work in Seaton Delaval colliery. He   
 worked with the{pit ponies.}The ponies
 were used below ground to pull the    
 tubs full of coal to the bottom of the
 shaft. When he returned to Seaton     
 Delaval he worked as the lamp lighter.
 The lamps used gas.                   
 He told us of a game called{potchey.  
 You make a hole in the ground and     
 everyone has to roll marbles into the 
 hole. The person who is 'on' has to   
 try to stop the marbles from going in 
 the hole. Those that he stops he can  
 keep for himself.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
