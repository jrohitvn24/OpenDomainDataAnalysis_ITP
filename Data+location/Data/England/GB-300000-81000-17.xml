		<content> On Guy Fawkes' Night, there are lots  
 of firework parties in Exmouth. Some  
 families have there own celebrations; 
 others go to big displays. There used 
 to be a huge party held at{Stoke Lyne 
{Hospital}in Brixington but last year  
 (1984) it was moved to the{town       
{football ground}on{Southern Road.}It  
 was a great night out but cost quite a
 bit to go in. You could buy sparklers 
 but they were expensive. There was a  
 big bonfire in the middle of the field
 and if you made a Guy, a man would    
 take it from you and put it on top of 
 the fire! The football pitch is       
 outdoors, but you never get cold      
 because the heat from the fire and the
 barbecue keeps you warm. There was    
 food and drink on sale and some       
 competitions for children. All the    
 money raised went to Exmouth          
 charities.                            </content>
