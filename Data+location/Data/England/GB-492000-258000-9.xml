		<content> Farming is by far the largest         
 employer. 29 males declared themselves
 involved as farmers, managers,        
 foremen, mechanics,a stockman, a game 
 keeper and a student, as well as      
 general workers and tractor drivers.  
 Women and itinerant workers are       
 employed on grading and piecework.    
 Everyone else travels. Car ownership  
 is high, only about 10 households are 
 without one. Most travel to the St.   
 Neots area, to work in the paper mill,
 insurance offices, stores or for the  
 Eastern Electricity Board. One is a   
 travel agent, one a postman, another  
 works for the Anglian Water Authority 
 at Grafham Water. To Bedford travel 3 
 engineers, a warehouseman and a       
 Building Inspector; to Stevenage, 2   
 engineers and a research worker. There
 is one unemployed male householder.
