		<title>20Fritchley Poems</title>
		<content> I like Fritchley because it has lots  
 of fields and I like picking flowers  
 and I like feeding the horse and      
 stroking it and I like walking to     
 school and doing my maths.I like      
 picking damsons out of the back field.
 I dont like the noisy traffic and the 
 muddy footpath, and I dont like       
 crossing the road at the top of the   
 hill.                                 
 I dont like Fritchley because there is
 no Sports Centre and nowhere to play  
 football or cricket.There are no      
 swings and slides.I wish there were   
 things like fairs,discos and circuses.
 That would be more fun.Fritchley is   
 untidy and I dont like the streets    
 _it's too far to the shop if you want 
 a can of pop!
