		<title>15A YEAR ON GLENMOOR FARM</title>
		<content>   A herd of 60 dairy cows with approx.
 60 young cattle,together with 3000    
 laying hens and 500 young birds, make 
 winter a constantly busy time. During 
 the winter we try to get most of the  
 land ploughed and a great deal of     
 manure is spread wherever possible.   
 Potatoes are sorted, bagged and sold  
 from October to February.             
   Up to early August most of the      
 cattle are still indoors. Outside in  
 the Spring, approximately 40 acres of 
 spring corn is sown, as are potatoes  
 and turnips for cattle feeding.       
   Fencing is always a problem and all 
 has to be secure before the cattle are
 turned out to grass.                  
   We begin cutting grass for silage in
 early June and grass for hay in late  
 June.
