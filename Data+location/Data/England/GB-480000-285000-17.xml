		<title>17Pipewell Village-General</title>
		<content>   Pipewell is a hamlet near           
Wilbarston. Yet it was once a very     
important centre for the whole of the  
Midlands. King John used to hold       
his Midland Parliament there. Deer can 
still be seen in the wood where he used
to shoot, which was part of Rockingham 
Castle estate. A Cistercian Abbey was  
built in 1143 by William De Betevileyn,
as a daughter house of Fountains Abbey.
Unfortunately this was destroyed by    
Henry 8th and little evidence, apart   
from some earth, remains. The plague   
is supposed to have come to the abbey  
in 1491 and the monks' bodies were     
buried in consecrated ground. Their    
ghosts are supposed to be seen in      
Skeleton Wood. Pipewell Woods contain  
the "3 bears house", an old            
gamekeeper's house, which now contains 
stuffed animals. The village also      
contains a trout pond called Harpers   </content>
