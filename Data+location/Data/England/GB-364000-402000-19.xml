		<content>                                       
 THERE WAS A{MIXTURE OF ANIMALS}KEPT   
 THERE.  THE CROPS WHICH WERE GROWN    
 WERE MAINLY OATS, WHEAT, TURNIPS,     
 MANGLES AND CALE FOR FEEDING TO THE   
 CATTLE IN WINTER. {PEAS}WERE ALSO     
 GROWN AND AN OLD MAP SHOWS OUR GARDEN 
 AS A PEA FIELD.  DURING THE 19TH      
 CENTURY THERE WAS ALSO A{SMALL FACTORY
 WHICH WAS PROBABLY USED FOR SPINNING  
{SILK, COTTON OR WOOL.} NOWADAYS THE   
 FARM IS FARMED TOGETHER WITH ANOTHER  
 FARM.  OTHERWISE IT WOULD NOT MAKE    
 MONEY.  THE BARNS AND PIGSTYS ARE     
 LITTLE USED EXCEPT FOR STORAGE OF WOOD
 AND HAY.  THE{GARDEN}SURROUNDING THE  
 HOUSE WAS ONCE A HEN RUN.  IT IS NOW  
 VERY LARGE.  WE THINK THAT THE PRESENT
 KITCHEN WAS PROBABLY USED AS A COW    
 SHED.  PART OF THE WALLS IN THE HOUSE 
 ARE STILL MADE OF{LATH AND PLASTER    
 (CONTINUED ON P20)                    </content>
