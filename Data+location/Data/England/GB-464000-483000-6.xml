		<content> Employment.                           
       The unemployment rate in this   
 area is well below the national       
 average. Light industries, tourism,   
 shops and other service industries    
 provide employment in nearby market   
 towns of Helmsley, Kirkbymoorside and 
 Pickering. Farming remains an         
 important source of employment.       
       There has been an influx of     
 professional people into the local    
 villages. These people are often      
 employed in the local schools, by the 
 National Park, by the Forestry        
 Commission and by banks and building  
 societies. Some commute by car to work
 in York and Teeside.                  
       The range of employment for     
 young people in limited but there is  
 little youth unemployment. Seasonal   
 employment provides temporary work.
