		<title>08THE BARWELL ESTATE</title>
		<content> The{Barwell Estate}is a large farm    
 to the immediate west of Chessington  
 (lat.51.21, long.19.1).  It was       
 originally part of the Merton College 
 property, &amp; was bought by Lord Foley  
 c.1750.                               
    A Mr. Barker (grandfather of the   
 present owner) purchased the Burnt    
 Stub in 1910, largely rebuilding the  
 house. This development is now owned  
 by{CHESSINGTON ZOO}and retains its    
 name{(THE BURNT STUB)}though it is now
 a modern restaurant. The same Mr.     
 Barker purchased the Barwell Estate   
 about 1914.                           
   It has always been an agricultural  
 estate, though formerly much larger.  
 Presently it is a 250-acre grass farm,
 supporting sheep,cattle &amp; horses.  A  
 small fishing lake is let to an       
 angling club, and Mrs. Barker runs a  
 livery yard.                          </content>
