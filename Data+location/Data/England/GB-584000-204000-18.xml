		<content>   For a small town we are fortunate in
 being able to take part and enjoy a   
 variety of Arts.The local Oakwood Art 
 Centre offers tuition in all musical  
 instruments as well as group work in  
 the band,string or woodwind group or  
 brass.It produces 2 concerts a year.As
 well the Centre puts on 2 classical   
 conerts,6 jazz,2 folk and 4 plays per-
 formed by amateur and professionals.  
 This month "Midsummer Night's Dream"is
 being produced.Exhibitions of art,pho-
 tography and needlecraft also take    
 place.The town has two ballet schools 
 and a majorette group.Maldon Choral   
 Society produces an average of 3 conc-
 erts a year-some in conjunction with  
 other choral societies and some with a
 full orchestra.Local churches also    
 have choirs and drama guilds which    
 regularly give performances of a high 
 standard.                             </content>
