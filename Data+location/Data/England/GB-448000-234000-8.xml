		<content>    We talked to Mrs C. who has lived  
 in Kings Sutton for about twenty      
 years.   She loves the village and    
 thinks the people in her street are   
 very friendly and kind.   She does not
 want to move.   She lives in Wales    
 Street which is very near the railway 
 station.   She rides a bicycle most of
 the time, as she does nearly all of   
 her shopping in the village because   
 she thinks the shops are very good.   
 If she does need to go to Banbury, she
 uses the train because it is nearer   
 and cheaper than the bus.             
    Mrs C., who used to be a school    
 governess, served on the Parish       
 Council and wrote the village         
 newsletter.   She enjoys going to the 
 Women's Institute and also            
 baby-sitting and going to jumble      
 sales.                                
                                       </content>
