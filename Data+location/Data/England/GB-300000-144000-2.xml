		<title>02Blue Anchor railway Station</title>
		<content> The station was opened in 1874 by The 
 Great Western Railway. The original   
 name was Bradley Gate. In 1904 the    
 station was then rebuilt, a double    
 track and a passing loop were put in  
 as before there was only one track.   
      The track from Washford to Blue  
 Anchor is a steep of 1 in 65.The road 
 goes over the railway line and the    
 gates are controlled by the person in 
 the signal box which has a 17 lever   
 frame.In order to celebrate the 150th 
 Birthday the station is being         
 converted into a museum.The line was  
 reopened in March 1976 between Blue   
 Anchor and Minehead.
