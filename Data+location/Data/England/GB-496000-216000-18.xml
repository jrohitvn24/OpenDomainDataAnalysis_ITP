		<content>Children's Games Part Two:             
BULLDOG                                
Bulldog is a game played by any number 
over three. One child is selected to be
"it". The "it" calls all the children  
to run across the playground from one  
end to the other. If the "it" can catch
a person before he can reach the other 
side of the playground then he joins   
the "it" and becomes a second "it" and 
together they call the children across 
and try to catch them. The game ends   
when all the children have been caught.
A rougher version of Bulldog is often  
played where the "it" or "its" have to 
lift a child completely off their feet 
before they are caught(or pin them to  
the ground). These versions are often  
banned in schools because of the danger
of accidents.
