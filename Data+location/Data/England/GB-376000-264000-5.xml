		<content> In{1655 Thomas Foley,}son of the early
 Stourbridge Ironmaster Richard Foley, 
 bought Witley Court from Thomas       
 Russell. His grandson,the first{Lord  
{Foley,}transformed the house between  
{1683}and{1733.}He added the two north 
 wings and erected stable blocks. He   
 was also responsible for the          
 alterations to the church, completed  
 in{1735}in which the site of the      
 church was moved nearer to the  Court 
 enabling direct entry to be made from 
 the Court. In the late {18th }century 
 and early{19th}century the brick      
 building was stuccoed and porticos    
 were added to the north and south     
 sides by the architect{John Nash.}The 
 north portico was supported on six    
 ionic columns and the south portico on
 eight.In 1837 due to family debts     
 Witley Court with its estates was     
 sold to Lord Ward for Â£890,000.       </content>
