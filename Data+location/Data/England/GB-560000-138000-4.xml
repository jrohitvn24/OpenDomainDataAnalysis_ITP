  Today the bus service from Pembury is
 a twenty minute one, the bus takes    
 about ten minutes to reach Tunbridge  
 Wells, and the journey costs 60       
 pence.                                
  A motorized bus was first introduced 
 between the wars, the journey then    
 cost 3d, and it took 15 minutes. This 
 service replaced horse drawn cabs,    
 kept at the Camden Hotel. The service 
 was two hourly, on week days only. The
 three and a half mile journey took    
 half an hour.                         
  Before the 1920s the roads were very 
 poor. At this date they were tarred   
 over for the first time. Their form   
 has changed very little since. With   
 increased car ownership, the roads are
 inadequate for today's traffic.
