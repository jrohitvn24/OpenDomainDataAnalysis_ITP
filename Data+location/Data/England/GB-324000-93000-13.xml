		<title>13ARTS AND CRAFTS IN COLYTON</title>
		<content>    Drama is represented in the area by
 the Colyton Theatre Group, who put on 
 an annual play and pantomime in the   
 Feoffees Hall.                        
    Colyton also boasts an art gallery 
 where local painters exhibit their    
 work. Leather goods are produced for  
 local use and for tourism in the      
 tannery and saddlery. There is a forge
 and a blacksmith still working within 
 the town.                             
    The East Devon area has long been  
 famous for its lace making industry.  
 Many people in Colyton do this as a   
 hobby and as a cottage industry.      
    Some other crafts practised are    
 macrame, pottery, corndolly making and
 basket weaving. There is still a      
 working forge and a tannery which uses
 traditional methods.                  
    St.Andrews Church has a choir and  
 occasional festivals are held there.  </content>
