		<title>04MEET WARMINSTER'S MAYOR!</title>
		<content> Mr Alwyn Curtis, Warminster's Mayor in
 1984-5, has a strong commitment to the
 town - he has lived here for 63 years.
 As Mayor he was kept very busy because
 he was invited to attend many local   
 events. For example, Mr Curtis helped 
 to run band concerts raising over Â£500
 for charity - one of the events he    
 most enjoyed in his year of office. On
 top of that, the Mayor chairs meetings
 of Warminster Town Council. 12 elected
 Councillors, 6 from the East Ward, 6  
 from the West Ward, act as "watchdogs"
 for the town. They check planning     
 applications, make sure local opinions
 are heard by District and County      
 Councils, and oversee a budget of some
 Â£22000 a year including Â£2500 in      
 grants to help the local community.   
 Altogether being Mayor meant a lot of 
 responsibility for Mr Curtis, but it  
 has not changed his outlook on life.  </content>
