		<content>   The existing sports centre huts are 
 to be demolished and an indoor centre 
  built at Broadbridge Heath.The       
 present Clubs will be rehoused.There  
 will be an{ice rink, swimming pool,   
{tennis and squash courts and a gym.   
   The development is a{joint council  
{and private venture}and it is         
 anticipated that 300,000 people will  
 use it.As a result the present sports 
 facilities in Horsham will be turned  
 into community centres as there will  
 not be so much demand for them.       
   Broadbridge Heath has been chosen   
 for development because the Park area 
 in Horsham is covenanted. Also,it     
 has better{access and communication   
 than other proposed sites.The centre  
 will cost nearly{20 million pounds}and
 work will take 18 months beginning at 
 the end of 1985.The new sports is     
 welcomed by the local community.      </content>
