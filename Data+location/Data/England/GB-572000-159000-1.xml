		<title>01AYLESFORD,ECCLES AND AREA</title>
		<content> The D block covers a small part of the
 village of Aylesford,and the land to  
 the north as far as the North Downs   
 including Eccles village.             
 Most of land is agricultural; cereals 
 predominate,with some woodland.       
 Aylesford is about 3 miles from the   
 County Town Maidstone.There has been a
 settlement at Aylesford since         
 prehistoric times, probably because it
 was the lowest fording point on the   
 River Medway.Recent development,      
 housing and warehousing is also linked
 with transport routes;the proximety of
 2 Motorways M2 (London-Dover) and     
 M20/M26 (folkestone-London and the    
 west).Eccles grew up to provide homes 
 for workers in the cement industry in 
 the mid 19th century.The clay and     
 chalk pits are now worked out.
