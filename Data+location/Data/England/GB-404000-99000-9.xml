		<title>09GOVERNMENT LOCAL MAYOR</title>
		<content> Last term Mr H Solomon came to{       
{Ferndown Middle School}so that we     
 could ask him some questions about    
 being the Mayor. He said he used to be
 the{Headmaster}of{Gorsemoor Middle    
{School}but now he has retired and is  
{Mayor of Ferndown.}He told us that if 
 a lady becomes the Mayor, she is      
 called the Mayor but her husband is   
 not called the Mayoress!              
 Mr Solomon lives in{Stapehill}and was 
 the Headmaster of four other schools  
 before he became the Head of          
 Gorsemoor.                            
 Every week he has to go to see the    
{Town Clerk}to ask about his programme 
 for the week. When he visited us, he  
 wore his chain of office.             
 We made a cine film of Mr Solomon     
 answering our questions and when the  
 film was developed, he came to school 
 again to watch it with us.            </content>
