{Sunday}Mum and Dad both get up earlier
 on a Sunday.Dad always goes to work   
 for an hour on a Sunday.While Dad is  
 at work,Mum and Julie are preparing   
 dinner.I sometimes go and help going  
 to count the cows and calves.After    
 dinner Dad and Mum have a sit down and
 watch television while we play out.In 
 the evening we get changed.We always  
 go out on a Sunday night.We go to the 
 "Butcher's Nook Club"which is in the  
 village called Hemswell.At about a    
 quarter to nine bingo starts.At about 
 a quarter to eleven bingo has         
 finished,so we go home.My family lives
 in a quite isolated area near the     
 river Ancholme.Our few neighbours live
 over two hundred metres away.
