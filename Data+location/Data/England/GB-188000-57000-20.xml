		<title>20The local environment.</title>
		<content> The area surrounding the three        
 villages is a bit of a mixture.To the 
 East the countryside has been ruined  
 by the china clay workings which have 
 left the white mountains of waste     
 which visitors to Cornwall always     
 notice.To the West the land is        
 agricultural in the main, finally     
 ending with the cliffs and the sea    
 beyond.North East,along the main A30  
 lies the Goss Moors,unspoilt rough    
 moorland very much like Bodmin Moor to
 the North again.In spite of being     
 under the shadow of the clay tips,the 
 feeling is of a rural,but harsh       
 environment with none of the beauty of
 a Cotswold village,but with a charm of
 its own.                              
 The climate is mild,and being so near 
 the sea the weather is often wet as   
 the winds carry the clouds towards the
 land.                                 </content>
