		<title>12Youth Groups in Stamford Br.</title>
		<content> The boys and girls from our village,  
 and children from High and Low Catton 
 join the clubs in Stamford Bridge.We  
 have Brownies,Guides,Cubs,Scouts,a    
 Youth Club and a Drama club and a     
 Venture Scout club.Guy Oldfield       
 belongs to the Stamford Bridge Cubs:  
 We are called the Vikings,after the   
 battle.We go from 6.30pm until        
 8.00pm.In that time we work for       
 badges.I went for my First Aid        
 badge.But I failed.The leader is      
 called Akela: means the wise wolf.On  
 the 22nd of June 1985 our cubs went to
 Pocklington where we worked for       
 badges.I passed my Athlete Badge.I had
 to do a 20m sprint,a long jump,a high 
 jump and throw the cricket ball.When  
 we went to Givendale Camp I fell in   
 the stream.It was not deep but I got  
 stuck because it was very boggy.
