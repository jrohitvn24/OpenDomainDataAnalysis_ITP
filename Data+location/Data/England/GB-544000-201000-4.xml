		<title>04THE MARKET IN EPPING</title>
		<content>  There has been a{Charter Market}in   
 Epping since 1575, and from 1914 it   
 has been on a Monday.The Town Council 
 took control over the market from the 
 District Council in 1981 because they 
 thought that a smaller Council should 
 administer it.The{Superintendent}of   
 the Market collects the rent from the 
 traders.There are{77}stalls whose rent
 is Â£8.00.If the traders don't turn up,
 they still have to pay.There is always
 a queue of casuals who eagerly wait   
 for a vacant stall.There has always   
 been a rent.                          
 The stalls are put up by outside      
 contractors at 4:30a.m and are taken  
 down by 9:00 p.m.The most{popular     
 stalls are the clothes stalls,followed
 by the fruit 'n' veg, and then come   
 household stalls.                     
 We shall always want to have a market 
 in Epping.                            </content>
