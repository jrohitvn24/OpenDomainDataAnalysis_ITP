		<content>    Pudsey has a total of fifteen      
 schools,including Fulneck - a private 
 school catering for boys and girls    
 separately.Of the rest,twelve were run
 by the West Riding Education          
 Authority.Five of these are combined  
 junior/infant schools with pupils aged
 5-11,two are infant schools(5-7),two  
 more are junior schools(7-11) and     
 three are high schools(11-18) -       
 Crawshaw,Priesthorpe and Grangefield. 
 The other two schools,Swinnow Middle  
 (9-13) and Hough Side High(13-18),were
 outside the old Pudsey Borough and    
 were the responsibility of the Leeds  
 City Council.Hence the different      
 age-ranges.Both systems produce a good
 standard of education.The total school
 population in the state system in     
 Pudsey is about 5,500.The oldest      
 school in the area is Primrose Hill   
 which was originally a 'board school'.</content>
