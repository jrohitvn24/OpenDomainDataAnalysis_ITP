		<content> Since this is a low population area   
 there is only one Post Office at      
 Wistow and none in the Raveleys.      
 There are, however, daily mail        
 deliveries throughout the area.  The  
 main avenue of communication is the   
 telephone.  All the farms and         
 principal services in the area are    
 available on the telephone, and all   
 lines are based on the Ramsey         
 exchange.  Additionally a telephone   
 call box is available for public use  
 in all three villages.  There are     
 various forms of radio communication  
 also.  There is an amateur radio      
 transmitter and receiver living in    
 Wistow and a small number of people in
 Wistow and the Raveleys operate C.B.  
 (Citizen Band) radios.  Another form  
 of communication especially popular on
 the larger farms is personal radio    
 systems.                              </content>
