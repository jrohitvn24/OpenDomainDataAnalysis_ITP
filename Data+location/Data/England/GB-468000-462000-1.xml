		<content> This section lies to the south west of
 the Howardian Hills. It is rolling    
 contryside levelling out to the plain 
 of the VAle of York to the west. The  
 main railway line and trunk road A64  
 from York to coast at Scarborough     
 cross this section. It is mainly      
 cereal and vegetable farming with some
 lifestock. There are two principal    
 villages, Flaxton and Barton- Le-     
 Willows. A mixture of old (red brick  
 and stone) and modern houses flank the
 sides of the village streets which are
 bordered with broad grassed areas. The
 land is drained by ditches to the     
 Spitalbeck taking water down to the   
 river Derwent.
