		<title>15Heather through the Years</title>
		<content> Heather village was very different in 
 the old days.  About 1910 it had two  
 bakers, two butchers, a tailor, shoe  
 repairer, blacksmith, shoeing smithy  
 and even a bank; but all these,       
 together with three thatched cottages 
 and seventy original houses, have now 
 gone.  Local emplyment was mostly in  
 farming or mining, but also brick     
 making, building and, later, motor    
 engineering and haulage firms.  The   
 railway transported coal, bricks and  
 stone as well as passengers.  The     
 stone was taken from the trucks, put  
 into carts which were pulled by horses
 and dumped by the roadside.  The      
 roadmender would fetch some in his    
 barrow, shovel it into the hole in the
 road and bang it in - and that was    
 that!  Sometimes the farmers would    
 send corn, potatoes and milk by train.
