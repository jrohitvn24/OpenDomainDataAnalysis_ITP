		<content>There have been quite a few changes in 
recent years. Most families were much  
larger with sometimes thirteen         
children or more.It was often hard     
to feed so many and they would not have
roast meat except for a special treat. 
There were no washing machines and     
clothes had to be washed by hand.      
  The chapel was the school in those   
days and to get to school the children 
had to walk.After school the pupils    
would sit against the wall and people  
used to give them a drink if they held 
out their tin cups. In the school there
were about eighty children.            
Of course most children had pocket     
money like they do now but to get      
their money they had to do jobs for it 
like picking strawberries or helping   
the farmer.
