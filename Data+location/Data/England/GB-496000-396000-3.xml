 We interviewed Mrs Coulson who has    
 lived in this area since she was      
 born and moved to Waddingam fifty     
 years ago.This is what she told us    
 when we asked her what life was like  
 then.                                 
{1935}Fifty years ago there was a      
 draper's shop, a butcher's shop, Post 
 Office and a cobbler's in             
 Waddingham.Milk was taken from        
 Beckside Farm to a neighbouring       
 village to be sterilized.It was then  
 brought back by horse and cart and    
 sold by the pint and the half pint.It 
 was 3.5d for one pint.Bread was baked 
 in village at the mill and taken round
 the village hot.A loaf of bread cost  
 4d.There was a coal merchant in the   
 village who came round selling coal in
 a lorry at 2s4d a bag.
