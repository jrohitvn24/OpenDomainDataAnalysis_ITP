		<title>11TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>   A traffic count was conducted at the
 gates of St. Michael's school between 
 10.05am and 11.55am on Tuesday June   
 4th 1985 and again on Friday June 14th
 1985 between 1.30pm and 3.20pm.The    
 results in each period were           
 comparable.Cars and commercial        
 vehicles were the most frequent       
 passers.Taking both periods together  
 607 commercial vehicles travelled     
 towards Colne and 299 towards         
 Skipton,whilst 2658 cars travelled    
 towards Colne,and 1759 towards        
 Skipton.By far the most frequently    
 observed vehicles were those belonging
 to Pendle Council.                    
   Bus services are not very frequent  
 and the private car is much relied    
 upon.Bicycles are used but the        
 undulating countryside militates      
 against them.
