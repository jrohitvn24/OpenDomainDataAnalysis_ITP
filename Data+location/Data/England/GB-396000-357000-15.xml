LEEK HAS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSES
THROUGH WHICH CAN BE TRACED THE        
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOWN AND THE        
SURROUNDING AREA.                      
IN THE TOWN CENTRE CAN BE SEEN THE     
TERRACED HOUSES WHICH WERE BUILT AT THE
TIME OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEXTILE 
INDUSTRY IN LEEK.MOST OF THESE HOUSES  
HAVE NOW BEEN "MODERNISED" THAT IS THEY
HAVE HAD BATHROOMS FITTED AND TOILETS  
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INDOORS, THE ORIGINAL
TOILETS WERE BUILT AT THE TOP OF THE   
YARD. THERE ARE ALSO SOME LARGE HOUSES 
IN THE TOWN CENTRE WHICH WERE BUILT FOR
THE MILL OWNERS.                       
ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THE TOWN NEW      
HOUSING ESTATES HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE 
LAST TWENTY YEARS. THESE WERE BUILT TO 
SATISFY THE DEMAND FOR PRIVATE HOUSES. 
THAT IS HOUSES OWNED BY THE PEOPLE     
LIVING IN THEM.  (CONT'D)              </content>
