		<content>The Parish Church of St. Lawrence      
  The church is not mentioned in the   
Domesday Book. It has a wooden and     
iron door and lovely windows and a     
clock. It is a Norman church. It was   
built about 1150. The church is made   
of a lot of different stones. We made  
rubbings of the stones. The original   
Norman church was probably built       
without aisles. There would have been  
a low central tower. A lot of the      
tower still remains.                   
  We went to the church to make        
rubbings of the graves. The oldest one 
I saw was for the year 1556. The man   
was around 80 years of age. The graves 
were sometimes almost underground.     
On the church wall there is a marking  
and it meant the level above           
sea-level. The clock has Roman         
numerals on it. They look nice because 
they were painted in real gold.        </content>
