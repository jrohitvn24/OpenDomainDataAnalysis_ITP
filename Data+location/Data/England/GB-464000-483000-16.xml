		<content> Youth (1).                            
       There is some concern that young
 people will leave the area because of 
 a lack of employment opportunities and
 the high cost of housing. "The village
 will become populated by old people   
 and by people with second homes. I'm  
 not hopeful as far as jobs go." (Girl,
 15) "It has'nt got a lot to offer in  
 terms of jobs so I'm not too hopeful."
 (Boy, 13)                             
       Despite these fears, young      
 people are generally contented and    
 value the freedom and space of the    
 countryside. They also like the       
 feeling of belonging to a small       
 community. Most wish to stay in the   
 area and want the area to remain much 
 the same but hope that sports         
 facilities can be improved.
