		<title>16THE RIVER THAMES</title>
		<content>  The River Thames flows through the   
 south west corner of this area,flowing
 east to west to the estuary near      
 Southend.                             
  It is tidal here resulting in a      
 mixture of salt and fresh water.There 
 is much apparent birdlife and an      
 increasing number of fish species     
 reported as the river becomes less    
 polluted _ Salmon have been taken out 
 of the W.Thurrock  Power Station water
 inlet.                                
  Large ships can still be seen on the 
 river moving up to the Purfleet Deep  
 Water Wharf and further upriver       
 towards London.There are also many    
 smaller vessels to be seen,such as    
 tugs,barges,coasters and private      
 yachts.                               
  The river is crossed here by the     
 Dartford Tunnel.
