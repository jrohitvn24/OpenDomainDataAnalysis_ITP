		<content>   {Phillip's day in school}           
    Today Mr. Sherrin,a Bulmershe      
 college student,came again for the    
 morning.His group wrote their stories:
 the rest corrected previous work.We   
 discussed a story and thought of      
 ideas.At playtime the boys played     
 football,the girls practiced passing a
 netball.During the morning we did     
 basic subjects;Maths,Reading and      
 English.At 12.00 the lunch bell went. 
 Children can have a hot meal or their 
 own packed lunch. I had crisps,Cornish
 pasty and a chocolate wafer.At 1.25 we
 returned to class and we began our    
 project on Dinton Pastures,a country  
 park.First we drew a map ready for a  
 visit. There has been some trouble,two
 boys had a fight and Duncan's rude    
 calendar was found and confisacated by
 our headmaster.At 3.30 my mother met  
 me in the playground and we went home.</content>
