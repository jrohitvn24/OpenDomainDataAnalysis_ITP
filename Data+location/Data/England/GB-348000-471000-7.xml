		<content>     A market granted in 1200 A.D. has 
recently been revived.  The flag of USA
flies from the church tower every July 
4th because Washington's family lived  
here. Their stars and stripes arms can 
be seen in the tower in stone. American
visitors call often and "invaded" for  
the Bicentenary which was by far the   
greatest modern event here. Washington 
House still stands and is privately    
owned.                                 
    The Hutton Charity of 1594 known as
the Free Grammar School and Hospital   
of Jesus still functions. In the last  
15 years his almshouses and school have
been rebuilt, the latter by the County 
Council. A disused Institute is to     
become 2 more almshouses. Each child   
receives a Bible on completing Primary 
Education.                             
    An annual visit by Morris Dancers  
is a modern revival.                   </content>
