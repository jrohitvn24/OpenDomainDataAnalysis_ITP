		<title>13Housing on Darlington Road.</title>
		<content> There has been a great deal of housing
 development in the easten end of      
 Richmond.In 1960 Shepherds of York    
 began building the first phase of an  
 estate of brick houses on the north   
 side of Darlington Road.The second    
 phase was built east of Cross Lanes   
 and eventually a third phase was      
 completed in the Aske Avenue area.    
    George Shaw began building the     
 Whitefield estate on the south side of
 Darlington Road east of Cross         
 Lanes.These are of brick  and stone   
 construction. Presently Randall       
 Orchard is making use of the last     
 available  land on Darlington  Road to
 build the Scots Dikes estate.         
    These houses are timber framed and 
 clad in stone. There is now no further
 building  land available inside the   
 borough boundary in eastern Richmond.
