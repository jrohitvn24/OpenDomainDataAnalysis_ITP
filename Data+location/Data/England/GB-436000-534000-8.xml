		<content> IN MY SPARE TIME I DO MY HOBBIES.     
 HOBBIES ARE WHAT YOU DO MOST OF YOUR  
 SPARE TIME.MINE IS MUSICAL            
 INSTRUMENTS.I LIKE PLAYING THE GUITAR 
 .A GUITAR IS A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT     
 WHICH IS MADE OF WOOD AND IT HAS SIX  
 STRINGS.I DO NOT GO TO LESSONS YET BUT
 I WILL BE GOING THIS SUMMER.I LEARN IT
 BY MYSELF WHICH IS A WAY TO GET BETTER
 BECAUSE I HAVE NO-ONE TO TEACH ME JUST
 YET.I PLAY IT IN MY BEDROOM BECAUSE   
 THE RADIATOR IS NEVER ON.IF THE GUITAR
 GETS HOT IT COULD RUIN IT.I MAKE DOLLS
 CLOTHES FOR MY SINDY DOLL.A SINDY DOLL
 IS A TALL DOLL WITH LONG HAIR.I MAKE  
 THE SINDY CLOTHES BY HAND.WHEN MY MAM 
 AND DAD HAVE SPARE TIME THEY WATCH    
 T.V. AND REST THEMSELVES.IF IT IS A   
 SUNNY DAY I TAKE MY LITTLE BROTHER    
 RICHARD DOWN TO THE REC.MOST OF THE   
 TIME I PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS.MY BEST   
 FRIEND IS JULIE GIBSON. LISA EGGINGTON</content>
