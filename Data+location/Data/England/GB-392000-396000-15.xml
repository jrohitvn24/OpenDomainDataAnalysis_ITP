		<title>15GUIDE BRIDGE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> Audenshaw C.of E.School is near a     
 railway junction (Guide Bridge).Most  
 of the area is residential but there  
 is some industry and some grass       
 land.We went to Guide Bridge Station  
 and asked some questions.             
 There are about 120 passenger trains  
 and approximately 30 goods trains each
 day.                                  
 The trains pass through from Hadfield 
 to Manchester,New Mills to Manchester,
 and Stalybridge to Stockport.         
 There are no Inter Cities.            
 The rush hours are 7.15 am to 9.00 am 
 and 3.45 pm to 6.45pm.                
 The sidings are used for train        
 repairs.
