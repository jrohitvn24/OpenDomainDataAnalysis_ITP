		<content>  The D-block is in a rural area which 
 includes three small villages;        
                                       
          {Penton Grafton}             
             {Fyfield}                 
            {Appleshaw}                
                                       
 The main road from{Andover}to         
{Ludgershall,}the{A342,}runs South-East
 to North-West almost making a diagonal
 across the block.  Beside it is a     
 branch{railway line}used by the       
 Ministry of Defence for freight.      
                                       
 Small country{lanes}form a network    
 across the block with a subsidiary    
 pattern of{footpaths}and bridleways.  
 The original{Domesday Survey}mentions 
 all three of the villages and much of 
 the character in existence in 1086 is 
 still in evidence to this day.
