		<title>17HOUSING IN LONGTON DISTRICT</title>
		<content>{   Housing}in the Longton area is very
 good. There is no overcrowding and    
 every house has some area of garden.  
 There is a mixture of detached, semi  
 detached and a few terraced homes and 
 flats. Some of the houses have        
 converted the roof space into living  
 accomodation. Around 18% of the homes 
 are bungalows some of which are Old   
 People's homes with a Warden looking  
 after the Close. These are one bedroom
 homes with one lounge,a small kitchen 
 and a bathroom.                       
   Most of the houses in the area have 
{central heating}run from a gas boiler,
 a few use electric storage heating and
 /or a coal fire. The more isolated    
 farms use coke to run the boilers but 
 very few are run on oil.              
   Each Summer there is a{Best Kept    
{Garden Competition}and on the whole   
 the gardens are very well kept.       </content>
