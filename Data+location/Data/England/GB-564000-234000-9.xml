		<title>09WILDLIFE IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> Sampford is a good place for rare wild
 flowers.One hundred and twenty seven  
 wild flowers have been seen here.The  
 rarest of these are the Bee Orchids   
 and the Butterfly Orchid.The most     
 common flower is the Sheeps Parsley.  
 Last month wild Yellow Irises were in 
 bloom on the pond.Also several stems  
 of delicate Ragged Robin were found in
 the damper parts of the wood.Alot of  
 butterflies have been seen around The 
 Sampfords too.They include The        
 Gatekeeper,Ringlet,Red Admiral and the
 Small Heath.Unfortunatly it has been a
 cold year for flowers.This has had a  
 bad effect on the bees in The         
 Sampfords with many local beekeepers  
 losing their hives.While at school we 
 have had three separate swarms        
 attracted to our chimney in the first 
 few days of July when the weather     
 suddenly turned hot.                  </content>
