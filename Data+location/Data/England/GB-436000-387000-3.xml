		<title>03SHOPPING IN THE DON VALLEY</title>
		<content>   There are many different types of   
{shop}in Darnall and Attercliffe,      
 ranging from small local shop to large
 super-store.                          
  {Prices}vary from shop to shop; super
 markets are often cheaper than local  
 shops. Prices range from fifty pence  
 for a pack of butter to around five   
 hundred pounds for a video cassette   
 recorder.                             
   Most people turn to the fish &amp; chip 
 shop or the Chinese take-away for fast
 foods. A bag of chips can be bought   
 for 25p.,but the Chinese take-away is 
 dearer at 27p.                        
   Most large shops take over a number 
 of small local shops, for example last
 year a chemist and two small shops    
 were demolished in order to build a   
 large{supermarket.
