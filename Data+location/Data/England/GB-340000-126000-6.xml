		<title>06PASTIMES IN LANGPORT</title>
		<content>    We are 7 and 8 years old and this  
 is what our friends like to do in     
 Langport during the evenings and at   
 weekends.                             
    All children like to play indoors  
 or out-of-doors with toys and friends.
 There are also organised clubs for    
 boys and girls.                       
   Boys: Cubs, Beavers (like Cubs but  
 for younger children), B.M.X. Club    
 (training on a bicycle for a display  
 team) and  Saturday sports club.      
   Girls: ballet, Brownies (similar to 
 Cubs but for girls) and gymnastics.   
   Both: judo, Sunday School, Thursday 
 Club, Youth Club and swimming at the  
 Comprehensive School during the       
 summer.                               
   Several children also attend the    
 nearest public swimming pool (at      
 Street, 15 miles away) for coaching   
 throughout the year.                  </content>
