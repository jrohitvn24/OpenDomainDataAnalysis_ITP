		<content> A few beef cattle are reared. Likewise
 sheep. There are several dairy farms. 
 Wheat,barley, oats and rape are the   
 most common crops. The area was once  
 famous for its brewing industry and   
 many hop fields. But since the 2nd.   
 W.W.There has been a steady decline   
 in hop growing and less than ten      
 fields are now cultivated.            
 The Government Forestry Commission    
 owns several areas of woodland,       
 particularly to the west of Chawton   
 and Farringdon.
