		<content> The animal population around the      
 Misterton area has gradually declined 
 in the last few years.As Farmers      
 strive for larger fields and yields   
 the hedgerows and cover needed by our 
 furry friends as sadly decreased.     
 Although the resilient rabbit seems to
 be gaining in numbers locally the     
 outlook for others is bleak.The{stoat}
 and{weasel}are holding firm were they 
 can find cover.The{badger}is no longer
 seen in this area due to the decline  
 of broad leafed woodland.Regular      
 hunting keeps the local fox population
 in check but they are occasionally    
 seen, as is the hare.The smaller      
 animals such as mice,voles and shrews 
 are regularly seen but these too must 
 decline as the hedges disappear.{Grass
{snakes}are scarce _ adder and common  
 lizard nonexsistent but common just   
 outside the area.                     </content>
