		<content> When we first looked at our area on   
 the map we thought we wouldn't have   
 much to write about.It seemed there   
 was so much flat farmland. We were    
 disappointed that some parts of       
 Moreton were not in our area.Then we  
 started to investigate the area and   
 found out that a lot goes on,in and   
 around our village.                   
 Most of us enjoy living in the country
 and would rather be here than in a    
 town.                                 
 Moreton has several special days.There
 is a Rose Queen Festival in           
 June,Village Day in July,and          
 St.Martin's Day in November.During the
 winter the Essex Hunt meets in        
 Moreton.                              
 We have just heard that Moreton has   
 won the Best Kept Small Village In    
 Essex Competition for the sixth time.
