		<title>09Our Farm.</title>
		<content>     Our farm is very small; we only   
 have 75 acres. My father and          
 grandfather are the only ones who work
 on the farm. We have 25 acres of crops
 and 50 acres of grass.                
     At the moment we have 196 lambs   
 and 300 sheep. We also have 10,000    
 turkeys kept in two huge poultry      
 houses.                               
     The farmhouse in which my family  
 lives used to be an inn and is about  
 450 years old. The stage coaches were 
 kept in what is now the farmyard.     
     Nearly every year my sister and I 
 have to bottle feed some lambs because
 the mother has not enough milk for    
 them all.                             
     We rear the turkeys for a firm    
 called Butterball. They bring them to 
 us when they have just been hatched   
 and fetch them again when they are    
 very big.                             </content>
