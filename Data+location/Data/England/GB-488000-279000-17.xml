		<content>  Stamford Road (A43) is the border    
between the catchment areas of Grange  
Primary and Avondale Infant and Junior 
Schools.                               
  Grange Primary School was built to   
serve the new estate and opened at     
Easter 1957.  Since its establishment  
the school has had 2 heads; the present
one since 1977.  A nursery unit is to  
be opened this year (1985) and it will 
be an integral part of the school. The 
Head sees nursery provision as being of
vital importance as many of the very   
young children in the area require some
real security before they begin their  
statutory schooling.  The school enjoys
good support from the parents and those
who belong to the Friends association. 
  Usually a third of children proceed  
to Henry Gotch Comprehensive and others
to Kettering Boys, Southfield or       
Montagu schools as allocated.          </content>
