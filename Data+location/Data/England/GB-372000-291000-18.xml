		<content> The whole of the area abounds in      
 history. We find traces of Stone Age  
 man, Bronze Age man and the Romans.   
 The Danes settled at Danesford, and   
 the Saxons lived along the river's    
 edge, near to where the town lies now.
 The Normans built a huge castle,      
 around which the town of 'Brugge' now 
 Bridgnorth grew up.After the castle   
 was destroyed during the Civil War,   
 the town fell into a bad state and may
 have almost disappeared had not the   
 Industrial Revolution begun a few     
 miles upstream at Ironbridge.         
 Bridgnorth took on a new lease of life
 as a major inland port. The huge      
 special boats called Trows which used 
 the river, carried raw materials up   
 and finished goods down the river, and
 on out to sea and around to London    
 docks.
