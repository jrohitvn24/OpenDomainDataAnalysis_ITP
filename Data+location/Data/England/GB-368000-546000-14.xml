		<title>14ALSTON MOOR'S PAST</title>
		<content> Whitley Castle is a diamond shaped {  
{Roman fort}and confirms a Roman       
 presence.The Roman road,the Maiden    
 Way,is known to pass through the area 
 but its exact route is in some doubt. 
 Possibly the Romans exploited the {   
{lead mines}but in the Middle Ages they
 were known as the Carlisle silver     
 mines and were being worked for lead  
 and silver.The{Earls of Derwentwater} 
 became lords of the manor,but after   
 the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 the    
 estates were confiscated and granted  
 to the {Greenwich Hospital}for Seamen.
 In the 19th century Alston was still  
 largely self-sufficient and it was    
 only in the 1820's that McAdam planned
 the roads which link Alston to nearby 
 towns.These roads can be hazardous in 
 winter conditions and Alston has been 
 completely cut off several times in   
 recent severe winters.                </content>
