		<content>          {Sticky Glue                 
 Sticky glue starts off with everybody 
 holding hands in a circle.The person  
 who is going to try to catch everyone 
 (On it),says "I went to the shop and  
 bought some sticky ,sticky substance" 
 (e.g.chocolate or treacle or sausages)
 He makes a long list of sticky things,
 at the end of which he says"sticky,   
 sticky glue".Atthe word "Glue"he runs 
 after the other players.When he       
 catches someone,that person has to    
 stand still and hold out his arms and 
 wait until he is freed by someone     
 going under his arms.If someone is    
 caught three times,he is on it and the
 game is restarted.
