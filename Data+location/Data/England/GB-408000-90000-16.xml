		<title>16PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> The girls in this class come from nine
 junior schools.All of them have       
 participated in playground games.These
 games were usually accompanied by     
 chants and could be played singly,in  
 pairs,standing in circles or as part  
 of a team.The names of these games and
 the accompanying words often differed 
 slightly from school to school.These  
 games ranged from the Nursery Rhymes  
 of the Infant Schools to Junior       
 skipping and ball games.Others        
 involved miming to words.Some of the  
 game words were risque and often      
 included the girls' own names or      
 references to their behaviour.        
 HERE IS A SKIPPING GAME.THE CHILDREN  
 STAND IN A LINE AND TWO TURN A LONG   
 ROPE.THEY TAKE IT IN TURNS TO SKIP AND
 ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AS 
 THE OTHERS CHANT.
