		<title>12EAST YELLAND POWER STATION</title>
		<content>                                       
 Although not situated within our grid 
 area the Power Station will soon      
 become a major social concern because 
 it is due to be demolished.  The Power
 Station was commissioned in the mid   
 1950's and was coal fired.  It has    
 been in "mothballs" since the late    
 seventies and has now been superceded 
 by other more modern stations.  The   
 concern surrounds the large amounts of
 asbestos built into the station.      
 Residents in our grid area are        
 obviously worried about the health    
 risk.  Assurances have been given that
 safety standards will be stringent.   
 Our local skyline will certainly look 
 different without the high power      
 station chimneys.
