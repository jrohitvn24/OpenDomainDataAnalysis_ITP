		<content>{The Parish Church of All Saints}      
 stands                                
 in the centre of the village. The     
 Church in some form has stood on this 
 site since Norman Times. The stone    
 built Church consists of nave,        
 chancel, north and south aisles with a
 square embattled tower containing four
 bells. The bells can only be chimed   
 because the tower is now unsafe. The  
 font is Norman and there are some fine
 examples of stained glass.            
  This year the Vicar moved into a     
 newly built{Vicarage}next door to the 
 old Vicarage which has been converted 
 into an old people's home.            
  There is also another Church, a{     
{Congregational Chapel}which was       
 founded in 1810 and is still active.
