		<title>15  PIGEON FANCIERS.</title>
		<content>We interviewed three pigeon fanciers in
Shiremoor.The first man,Mr Mason said  
that he had been keeping pigeons for 32
years and he bred them to replace the  
ones that are useless.He keeps them for
the fun of it and and for the prestige.
He has 50 old birds and 36 young ones. 
He rears approximately 40 chicks a     
year.His pigeons mate in February and  
March.He feeds them twice a day and    
once a day in winter. He feeds them on 
tick beans,maize,peas,wheat and barley.
 The second man has 108 pigeons and he 
has been keeping them for 25 years but 
he them keeps them to race.In Shiremoor
Club there are 18 members that he knows
of keeps pigeons.Most of them keep     
and rear their birds the same as Mr    
Mason.
