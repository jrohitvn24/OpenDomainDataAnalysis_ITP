		<content>   Most of the houses are lived in all 
 year because the people of Maidencombe
 are home loving.They are lived in by  
 the owner not rented from a landlord. 
 There are a few new houses.They fit in
 quite well because they are built in  
 the traditional way.They are mostly   
 made of brick and stone.They have a   
 slate or tiled roof.Some are thatched.
 There was a court house that was      
 turned into a hotel and farm house    
 which is a normal house now.The houses
 at Watcombe Heights and Petitor are   
 detached and very large.Some have been
 turned into flats.There is a select   
 block of flats where old people live. 
   Maidencombe villagers do not rise   
 very early and keep to a reasonable   
 bed time.They enjoy relaxing at home  
 and gardening.Most are retired so they
 take life easy.
