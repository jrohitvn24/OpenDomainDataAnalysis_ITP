{Sweet Chestnuts grown for their wood  
 which is hard and very durable.Sold by
 the standing acre they are{coppiced}  
 every 11_12 years (18 for hop poles)  
 producing smooth, straight timber.    
   Forwards,a family concern, prepare  
 chestnut in Petteridge for fencing and
 farm use. From November to the end of 
 March 10_12 acres of chestnut are cut.
 The chestnut is sawn off at ground    
 level, trimmed,cut into lengths and   
 brought to the yard.                  
   Posts to be set in the ground are   
 stood in boiling creosote to preserve 
 them,very straight pieces are selected
 for splitting in half for diamond     
 fencing,others are split into even    
 sized palings to be made into fencing.
 To retain their strength pales must be
 cleft or split,not sawn.{4 people}work
