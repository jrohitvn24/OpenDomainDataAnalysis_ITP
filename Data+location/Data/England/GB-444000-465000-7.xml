 the land.  Most of the farms have     
 belonged to one family for several    
 generations and are currently worked  
 by father and son. casual labour,     
 mostly women, is employed for potato  
 picking and sorting.  Several people  
 conduct one man businesses such as    
 joinery, secondhand car sales and     
 repair, building, caravan hire/tow bar

 are barrister, 2 research workers,    
 company directors, engineer,          
 journalist with Radio York, Sales     
 representatives, diplomat, civil      </content>
