		<content>   This block sees the meeting of urban
 settlement with open countryside.It   
 is, scenically, a very attractive area
 in parts, particularly on the open    
 uplands to the north and west of      
 Walshaw and Tottington.               
   Historically, this area belongs to  
 the great cotton era of Lancashire:   
 Walshaw, for example, had a           
 flourishing cloth making and dyeing   
 works as long ago as 1851.            
   The River Irwell flows through part 
 of the area; its valley having been   
 greatly improved in recent years.     
   Land-use is quite varied, although  
 dominated mainly by residential       
 zones.However industry, farming, water
 storage and recreation all contribute 
 to the overall land-usage.            
   The following pages should give the 
 reader a taste of the various aspects 
 of life which are found in the block. </content>
