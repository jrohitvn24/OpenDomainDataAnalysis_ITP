		<title>19A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content> I get up at five to eight. Then I have
 breakfast. I have cornflakes and      
 toast, then I wash. After that I brush
 my teeth and put on my school clothes.
 Then I go to school. First Mrs. Pedley
 calls the register. Then we go into   
 Assembly. Then we do English, then go 
 out to play.I play football. After    
 that we do maths and then have dinner.
 I have pasty, baked beans and ice     
 cream. After dinner we go into the    
 field to play football. In the        
 afternoon we do activities like       
 cooking, clay, music and Lego.We do   
 this until 3-30, then we go home.When 
 I get home I play with Tom Fagg.      
 Sometimes we play cricket. Then I have
 my Tea. After Tea I play cricket with 
 my Dad. Then I read to him, and I go  
 to bed at 7-30, turn off the light and
 go to sleep.
