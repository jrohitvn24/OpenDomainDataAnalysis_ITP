		<content> In this block bordered by four roads  
 only one of which A32 bears any heavy 
 traffic the arable and parkland (which
 is preserved for game) and woodland to
 the south(where the Foresty Commission
 grows the only Southern Beech Notho-  
 fagus Procera in South England)       
 support wildlife including deer,hares 
 which are now not so plentiful. Birds 
 to be found in the hedges bordering   
 the footpaths include sparrowhawks and
 owls also kestrels and plovers on the 
 higher grasslands. Such undisturbed   
 habitat supports insects and butter-  
 flies first the Orange Tips and Brim- 
 stones then the Ringlets,Speckled Wood
 Blues, with a few Marbled Whites but  
 not in colonies, Painted Ladies and   
 occsionally flying high amongst the   
 oaks the shy and resplendent Purple   
 Emperor butterfly.
