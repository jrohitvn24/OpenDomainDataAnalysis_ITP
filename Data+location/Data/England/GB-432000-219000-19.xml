		<title>19HISTORIC AREAS OF CHARLBURY</title>
		<content>  This area has many old buildings.When
Queen Victoria came to visit Charlbury 
in 1886 she had a Jubilee Fountain     
built.It stands on the end of the      
Playing Close.It looked much the same  
as it does now except there was a lamp 
on top which was taken off because     
people threw stones at it.             
  Round the Wychwood countryside there 
are a lot of ancient burial grounds.The
oldest house in Charlbury is Armada    
Cottage which was built in 1587.It is  
situated in Thames Street.The Bell     
Hotel in Church Street was built in    
1700.The Museum was opened in 1952. It 
is next to the Corner House and has    
many old objects relating to the area. 
Cornbury Park is owned by Lord         
Rotherwick and has many landscaped     
gardens.The Charlbury Society was      
founded in 1949 to administer the      
museum and other historical aspects.   </content>
