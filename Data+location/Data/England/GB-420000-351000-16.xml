		<title>16WIGBER LOW  EXCAVATION</title>
		<content> In the summer of 1974 a survey of the 
 hilltop (using a pulse induction      
 metre) revealed a small number of     
 anomalous readings.  When the turf was
 removed 2 spears were uncovered.  One 
 was removed and identified by         
 Sheffield City Museum as a{Saxon      
{Spear.}                               
 Later that year it was agreed with the
 Department of the Enviroment that a { 
{rescue excavation}should take place in
 case news of the find should leak out 
 to treasure hunters who had been      
 active in the area.  A{grant}of Â£280  
 was provided for the excavations, with
 pay also for a director and a         
 supervisor.  More monies were later   
 available.                            
 Three seasons work were carried out on
 the mound during 1975/76.
