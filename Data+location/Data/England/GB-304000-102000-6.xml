		<title>06FARMING IN PLYMTREE</title>
		<content> In the Plymtree area there are 21     
 named farms on the Ordnance Survey    
 map.  12 of these are working farms,  
 the rest being private dwellings      
 only.  Of these 12, 5 are dairy farms,
 5 are stock cattle farms, and 2 are   
 arable farms.  One dairy farm also    
 has a large battery chicken unit.     
 The grain produced at the arable farms
 is used for animal feed and some is   
 processed at a mill in the nearby     
 village of Payhembury.                
 The majority of the farms are small   
 (under 200 acres) and are farmed  by  
 tenant farmers.  They are usually     
 family concerns, possibly employing   
 one other person on a full time basis.
 At harvest times extra labour is      
 obtained through outside contractors  
 and through a co-operative agreement  
 between the farms.
