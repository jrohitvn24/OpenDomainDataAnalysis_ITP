		<title>19GHOSTS AND LEGENDS</title>
		<content> There are many stories of ghosts      
 around Flamstead.Dick Turpin who      
 frequented the area is supposed to be 
 seen,so is the "Grey Lady" who in her 
 own way was a highwaywoman as well as 
 the Lady of the Manor living at the   
 cell in Markyate.There are supposed to
 be many tunnels connecting the old    
 historic buildings of the area but    
 these are yet to be found.Most of the 
 legends in fact surround highwayman as
 the Watling Street(now the A5) has    
 been a major route for many hundreds  
 of years and was a rich hunting ground
 for these villains.
