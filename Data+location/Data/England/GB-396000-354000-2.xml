		<content>In Leek there is an indoor and outdoor 
market in the market place on          
Wednesdays.The market place carpark is 
cleared on Tuesday night and the stalls
set up by council workmen.There are    
about 103 stalls selling               
clothes,vegetables and fruit,household 
goods and toys. The rent of 7 pounds is
collected each Wednesday.              
The market place is cobbled with a     
central lamp-post to replace the       
original Butter-cross which is now in  
the cemetary.The indoor Butter Market  
was built in 1897,but Leek has had a   
market since 1208.The hall has lock up 
stalls.                                
No uncooked meat must be sold in the   
outside market.Anyone can set up a     
stall although adults are preferred!
