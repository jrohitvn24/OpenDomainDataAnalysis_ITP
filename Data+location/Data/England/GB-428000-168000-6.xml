		<content> Kennet. Mr. Woolnough said that when  
 he first came to his job, the{level of
{the water}was{raising}all the time and
 it had to be controlled by sluice     
 gates to stop flooding. This was      
 because the farmers all drained their 
 land into the river, but during the   
 last ten years the{level of the river 
 has{fallen}rapidly. This is because   
 the town of Swindon, which is fifteen 
 miles away, takes the water from the  
 Kennet to use as the domestic supply. 
 (I think it is also the industrial    
 supply too). When the water has been  
 used it is pumped back into the River 
  Thames. This means that there is not 
 a great deal of pollution in the river
 but it does mean  that the weeds which
 grow along the banks are continuously 
 losing the mud and water from around  
 their roots.It also means that nettles
 which root easily, soon spring up     </content>
