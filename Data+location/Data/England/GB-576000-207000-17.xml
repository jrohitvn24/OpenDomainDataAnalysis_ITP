		<title>17TRANSPORT IN LITTLE BADDOW</title>
		<content>   As an area with a population of 2000
 in 1985 Little Baddow suffers from a  
 lack of modern communication          
 facilities. This is largely due to the
 villages proximaty to the city of     
 Chelmsford and the unfortunate cuts in
 public spending.                      
   Many people do in fact have their   
 own private arrangements for travel in
 the area and most residents in the    
 village possess their own cars. The   
 highways, however, are narrow and     
 roads in the low lying areas are      
 liable to flood.                      
   Public transport is severely limited
 as there is no rail connection and the
 buses are infrequent except for       
 specially arranged school buses.      
   If you own a horse, however, then   
 you will be well catered for as there 
 are an abundance of bridleways and    
 country paths on which to ride.       </content>
