 There has been a church on this site  
 since the twelfth century.The first   
 rector was John in 1160 A.D.The church
 was built of local red sandstone and  
 in the nineteenth century was         
 considered unsafe and pulled down.A   
 new church was built in 1832 incorpo- 
 rating the base of the tower and two  
 pillars from the original building.   
 Some carved heads and two prone       
 figures were saved also.In 1872 the   
 chancel and high roof were added and  
 the galleries were removed.This year, 
 1985, the rear of the church has been 
 altered for use as a church hall.This 
 comprises  a large upper room and     
 toilet and lower room with toilet and 
 beverage area.Two rows of pews were   
 removed but no structural changes made
 so that it can be dismantled,if       
 desired.The cost was Â£63000.          </content>
