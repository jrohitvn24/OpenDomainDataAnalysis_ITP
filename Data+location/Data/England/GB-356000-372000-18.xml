		<content>  Acton Bridge Parish Room was built in
 1909, but was extended and modernised 
 in 1983/4.  The cost of the extension 
 waas Â£43000 plus Â£9000 for the car    
 park and Â£15000 to renovate the old   
 hall. Money was raised by the village 
 community with dances and other social
 events.                               
  There is a billiard room, cloakroom, 
 kitchen, bar and main function room.  
 Organisations which use th hall are   
 the Youth Club, Women's Institute,    
 Playgroup, Keep Fit Class and Bingo.  
  "At the Youth Club we like to play   
 pool.  A B.M.X. course is being built 
 at the back of the hall and we play   
 rounders on the field.  Most people in
 the area think the hall is very good."
