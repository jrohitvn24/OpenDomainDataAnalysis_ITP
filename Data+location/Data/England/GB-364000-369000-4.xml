		<title>04Leftwich Play School</title>
		<content>  Leftwich play school meets in a small
 hall every weekday morning.The        
 children are between 3 and 5 years    
 old.They have plenty to occupy them-  
 painting ,group activities,games,We   
 found on our visit that some of their 
 favourite things involved getting     
 messy!Play-doh,plasticine and the     
 sandpit are all popular.Most of the   
 time they would prefer to play among  
 themselves e.g. imitating heroes on   
 the T.V.,"Doctors and Nurses" etc.    
  The games that both boys and girls   
 liked playing were to do with jigsaws 
 and dressing-up.Some children         
 preferred to sit quietly and watch    
 T.V.                                  
   A similar play school meets in      
 Davenham Church Hall.Like Leftwich    
 they have trained women to lead the   
 play activities and to teach the      
 children simple things.               </content>
