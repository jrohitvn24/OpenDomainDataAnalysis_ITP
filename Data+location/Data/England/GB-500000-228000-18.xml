		<title>18ECOLOGY IN TODDINGTON</title>
		<content> Many of the footpaths studied were    
 found to be in good order with new    
 plantings of saplings. The flora and  
 fauna of these walks was considerable 
 The{streams}under observation were    
 found to contain vast quantities of   
 water plants and creatures. Many areas
 of the streams were free flowing and  
 clear. Effluent and chemical{pollution
 was hardly in evidence though litter  
 and metal rubbish were common place in
 most areas.{Hedgerows}were found in   
 pleasing conditions being either left 
 to naturalise or being well maintained
 and often layered. Many different     
 types of bird life and insects were   
 observed. Plant life was most abundant
 and tree life was found to consist    
 heavily of Ash, Maple and Hawthorn.   
 After testing, the plant life was     
 found to be supported by a neutral    
 type soil.                            </content>
