		<title>11AGRICULTURE AND ECOLOGY</title>
		<content>  There is constant discussion about   
 modern farming methods,{ecology}and   
{conservation.}For economic reasons    
 fields need to be bigger so trees and 
 hedges are removed, this changes the  
{landscape}and provides fewer habitats 
 for wild-life.{Foot paths}end up      
 crossing fields, to the annoyance of  
 both farmer and rambler.{Straw burning
 after harvest is still a problem. As  
 there are no animals on the farms     
 straw is no longer needed so only a   
 small quantity is baled and sold. Most
 straw is burnt on the fields making   
 large black clouds of smoke and ash   
 that seems to penetrate even closed   
 windows. No-one likes it. The farmers 
 get rid of the straw quickly and kill 
 off some weeds and diseases. Hedges   
 and the odd house get burnt too.      
 Chopping and ploughing in is being    
 tried. Other uses are being sought.   </content>
