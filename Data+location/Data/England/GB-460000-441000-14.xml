		<title>14P.C. Stacey.</title>
		<content> P.C. Stacey is our village            
 policeman.He works from his Police    
 House in Escrick,and patrols the 5    
 villages of Naburn,Stillingfleet,     
 Riccall,Kelfield and Escrick.Village  
 policemen used to walk or cycle round 
 their beat,but now most have patrol   
 cars. P.C. Stacey is usually able to  
 decide for himself how best to utilise
 his 8 hours on duty.Teleprinters and  
 radio convey information to him,and he
 visits the main station at Selby to   
 collect his mail.Burglary is the most 
 common crime in our area. P.C. Stacey 
 enjoys the variety his job offers,also
 he prefers working in a rural         
 community where he can get to know all
 the residents,both young and old.A    
 village policeman is really on duty 24
 hours a day,because he is always      
 available to give assistance when     
 required.                             </content>
