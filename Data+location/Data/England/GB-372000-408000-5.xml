		<content> The previously unemployed aeronautical
 engineer who runs his own waste       
 disposal company called Bolton Mini   
 Skips has been in business for twelve 
 months.He collects scrap metal and    
 sorts it out into various categories: 
 chrome, aluminium, copper,iron and    
 steel.For every ton of metal he       
 receives Â£35 and he can expect as much
 as Â£55 for a scrap car engine. The    
 iron and steel is crushed by machinery
 and is eventually sold to Spain       
 where it is smelted down and used in  
 the manufacture of cars.              
  Paper and wood are burnt and rocks,  
 stones and bricks (called hard core)  
 are sold to builders.                 
  The business is slowly growing and   
 the owner has now been able to employ 
 a young man.However, competition is   
 keen and unemployment is always a     
 possibility.                          </content>
