		<title>17LEISURE- CUCKFIELD CHILDREN</title>
		<content>  Many of the children interviewed swim
 regularly at Haywards Heath leisure   
 centre. The most popular sport amongst
 the boys is soccer and the girls,     
 netball. They watch TV for more than 2
 hrs. per day, their favourite         
 programmes being 'Dogtanian and the   
 Three Muskehounds' and 'Street Hawk'. 
 Most prefer pop music to classical,   
 their favourite groups being 'Wham!', 
 'Duran Duran'. All the children       
 interviewed receive pocket money, 25p 
 to Â£1 per week for which they are     
 expected to do jobs around the house. 
 The most popular comic is Beano and   
 the children also enjoy adventure     
 stories. With regard to holidays most 
 go more than once a year, staying in  
 hotels, their favourite place being   
 France. Most children interviewed     
 thought the leisure facilities in the 
 area were poor.                       </content>
