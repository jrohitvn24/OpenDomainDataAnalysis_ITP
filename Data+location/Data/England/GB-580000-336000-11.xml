		<content> The Norfolk dialect is a very         
 distinctive one with its own          
 vocabulary and grammar.  Sadly        
 however, since the last century it    
 seems to have been the language of the
 uneducated and no one of any standing 
 in society speaks it nor uses its     
 vowel sounds.  This is probably       
 because it is associated with country 
 folk, traditionally looked down upon  
 by their urban cousins.  In recent    
 years the dialect in Stanhoe has      
 changed markedly especially among the 
 young.  The distinctive vocabulary    
 with the young has almost gone.  What 
 remains, except among the over        
 fifties, is an amalgam of near cockney
 speech plus some Norfolk expressions -
 'in a muddle,' 'get wrong' are        
 examples.  It is doubtful if true     
 Norfolk will be heard in future years.
