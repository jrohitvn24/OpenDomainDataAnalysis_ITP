		<title>19COMMON LANE INDUSTRIAL EST.</title>
		<content>The first industrial building we saw   
was Godiva Industrial Products which   
had equipment stored in it, but no     
people and no furniture. A lot of the  
buildings looked quite old and a few of
them looked as if they were shut down. 
The estate is about 30 years old.There 
is a board with the names of companies 
on the estate but we noticed there were
more that were not on the board.The    
factories were very dirty and noisy.   
Many of them employed just 2 or 3      
people but some had quite large        
workforces.Most were concerned with    
engineering, but there was an          
upholsterer and a printer as well as a 
timber merchants and a swimming pool   
manufacturer.The biggest factory was   
Arden Products, an engineering firm.   
Opposite the estate were three shops   
and a telephone box.
