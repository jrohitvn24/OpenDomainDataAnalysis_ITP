		<title>09Ashford Manor,Ashford C.</title>
		<content>  The Manor was built in the 16oo's but
 we think there was another house on   
 the same site before the present Manor
 was built.Mr Hall is the owner of the 
 Manor. He has lived there all his     
 life and he owns the buildings of     
 Ashford School and High Meadow Farm   
 in Ashford too.It came to belong to   
 his family in 1860 because his great, 
 great Aunt married somebody named John
 Downs.There are about 12 rooms in the 
 Manor.In the summer Mr Hall likes his 
 parlour best and in the winter he     
 likes his sitting room best.The Manor 
 is built of stone and in the 1930's Mr
 Hall made it smaller and lower so it  
 would be cheaper and easier to run.Mr 
 Hall's favourite piece of furniture is
 a very old bookcase.The Manor has a   
 big garden which Mr Hall uses to grow 
 a few vegetables with lawns and       
 flower beds also.                     </content>
