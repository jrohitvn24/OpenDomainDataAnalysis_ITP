 Once a year, usually in July, the     
 village of Budock has a carnival      
 procession.The entries meet in the    
 field next to the church where they   
 are divided into categories and       
 judged.After judging the procession   
 moves through the village and turns   
 around at the Manderley Hotel.It      
 returns to the village playing field  
 where prizes are presented and a      
 barbeque is held                      
   {Budock Feast Day }is a revived     
 custom held on the 19th of November.  
 For the last few years the Womens'    
 Institute has made itself responsible 
 for arranging a communal supper and   
 entertainment in the village hall.    
   A garden show is held each summer in
 the village hall where local produce  
 is judged.
