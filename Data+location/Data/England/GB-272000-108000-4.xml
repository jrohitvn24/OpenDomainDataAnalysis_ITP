		<content> There is only one school in Lapford,  
 and that is our primary school.It is  
 fifty years old, as it was opened in  
 1935.There was a school before that,  
 built in 1860, and it is now used for 
 the playgroup and the youthclub.We    
 have 75 children in three classes.    
 We come to school when we are 5, and  
 leave at 11.Our classrooms are large  
 with lots of windows.We have three    
 classrooms, a dinningroom, a staffroom
 and a library.Outside there are two   
 playgrounds, a big playing field,     
 gardens lawns and a swimming pool.Some
 children come each day by minibus.When
 we leave we go to secondary schools at
 Chulmleigh or Crediton, each about    
 eight miles away.
