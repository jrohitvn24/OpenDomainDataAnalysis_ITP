		<title>07Travel to the Mainland, Ryde</title>
		<content>  From Ryde Pier there is a passenger  
 ferry to Portsmouth operated by       
 Sealink. This is a private company now
 having bought the business from the   
 nationalised company.This caused some 
 problems in 1985 because some         
 passengers had to buy separate tickets
 for the boat and train. Through       
 tickets can now be bought again.      
  The same company also runs the Car   
 ferry from Fishbourne to Portsmouth.  
  A company called Hovertravel runs the
 Hovercraft from Ryde to Southsea.They 
 have the Royal Mail contract and take 
 only ten minutes to cross. Many of the
 commuters use this route and Sealink  
 are talking about buying a new faster 
 catamaran type boat to win back some  
 of the passengers.
