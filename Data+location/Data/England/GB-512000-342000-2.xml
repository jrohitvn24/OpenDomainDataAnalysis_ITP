 junction of the higher ground to the  
 west and the flat fen land to the     
 east.The flight paths of the numerous 
 local R.A.F.station aircraft pass     
 close to this landmark and also close 
 to the other outstanding feature, the 
 unique eight sailed windmill.Aircraft 
 from the U.S.A.F. bases in Norfolk and
 Suffolk overfly the village and       
 surrounding farmland every day.

 between the north and east {Midlands }
 and the holiday resorts of {          
{Lincolnshire }and {East Anglia.}All   
 heavy goods and holiday traffic       
 travelling between these areas was    
 channelled through the narrow village 
 streets until the opening of a by-pass</content>
