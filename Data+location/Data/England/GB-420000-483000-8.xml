		<content> There is not very much pollution in   
 our region, although farmers are      
 concerned about the effects of        
 chemicals on the wildlife. Many are   
 conservationists.                     
 In our region we have a lot of        
 pheasants, deer, squirrels,rabbits and
 animals like that. Foxes and badgers  
 make their homes in nearby woodland.  
 We have not very many footpaths and   
 those we have are unmarked.There are a
 few bridle paths. The edges of fields 
 and roadsides have an abundance of    
 wildflowers giving colour for much of 
 the year, from snowdrops in early     
 spring to daffodils, bluebells,       
 speedwell, poppies and foxgloves of   
 the summer.                           
 Summer weather is variable. Winter can
 on occasion be more severe, cutting   
 off more isolated areas and farms.
