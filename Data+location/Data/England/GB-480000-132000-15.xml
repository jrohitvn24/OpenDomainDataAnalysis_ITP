		<title>15Methodist Church, Standford.</title>
		<content>  This church comes under the pastoral 
 care of the Haslemere Methodist       
 Minister who takes a service          
 fortnightly. Worship is held morning  
 and evening each Sunday largely led by
 local preachers,-trained and qualified
 lay men and women. There is a         
 fortnightly house fellowship during   
 the winter.The membership of 24 are a 
 closely knit caring group, whose      
 strength lies in four loyal families. 
  Special events, Harvest, Church      
 Anniversary, 126th, and this year a   
 flower Festival in connection with    
 their organ, restored for over Â£2000  
 raised locally, are more widely       
 supported.There are regular links with
 the local community: people from the  
 Grange welcomed to services, and often
 in the summer scouts camping at Hatch 
 Farm use the Standford Church Hall and
 they attend morning service.          </content>
