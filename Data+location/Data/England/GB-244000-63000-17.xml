		<title>17ORNITHOLOGY IN BERE FERRERS.</title>
		<content>   Our group first visited Bere Ferrers
 in December, long before we knew it   
 was to be our Domesday Block.  Members
 of the Young Ornithologists Club met  
 one of the leaders of the Plymouth    
 group so that he and his wife could   
 show us a flock of that lovely winter 
 visitor-the Avocet.  We watched those 
 graceful waders with their delicately 
 curved bills scooping the mud flats   
 for crustaceans.  Bere Ferrers is a   
 staging post for passing migrants and 
 a local breeding ground for           
 populations of Mute Swan, Shell Duck  
 and Mallard.                          
   On our summer visit we saw Swallows 
 House Martins and Swifts catching     
 insects in their swooping flight near 
 the river.  We also saw a Whimbrel    
 feeding. Rare visitors seen recently  
 are the Night Heron and the Spotted   
 Sandpiper.                            </content>
