		<content> Many of the mothers and fathers work  
 most hours to get a decent weekly     
 wage. Most couples have children they 
 rarely see.                           
 Many are clothed well and don't ask   
 for much because they know there's no 
 future for someone who has no 'O' or  
 'A' levels.                           
 Kids today get very depressed easily  
 maybe because of family problems or   
 problems at school. One single problem
 like maybe your father's had a rough  
 day at work and is tired, then other  
 people in the family have to suffer   
 too.                                  
 If something goes wrong for your dad, 
 he may take to drink and then may lose
 his job. Your mum tries to keep the   
 family together but she's tired and   
 also depressed. You want to help but  
 you don't know how. This is what many 
 families are like in Britain today.   </content>
