		<content> In a year lots of festivals go on     
 throughout the area, for instance the 
 School Fayre &amp; Cavaliers Disco. The   
 Cavaliers are a fund raising charity  
 organisation; the barn dance; the     
 Flower festival and the Harvest       
 festival. The{School Fayre}is held    
 once a year at the school Annexe      
 site,                                 
 with lots of stalls and games. There  
 are also ice-creams and hot dogs. The{
{Flower Festival} is run by the        
 Methodist church and our class had to 
 draw pictures of flowers.             
  Each {November the 5th}we have a     
 bomfire and firework display in a     
 large field to commemorate Guy Fawkes 
 death. The church holds a  fate once a
 year and the procedes go to charity.
