		<title>05FISHING AND BIRDWATCHING</title>
		<content> I like my area because of the Broads  
 and the dykes where I can go fishing  
 and birdwatching.                     
 The people are nice and kind.         
 Some of the birds you can see are     
 Cranes,Bitterns,Herrons,Grebes,Ducks  
 and Coots.Also there are Hedgehogs,   
 Foxes,Mice,Rats,Hares and Rabbits.    
 If you go fishing there you will catch
 Perch,Pike,Roach,Rudd,Bream and Eels. 
 Dotted around our villages are hides  
 and birdwatching places,because the   
 inhabitants respect wildlife.         
 It is very quiet and peaceful because 
 we have few main roads.               
 The country side is very beautiful and
 has a lot of colourful wild flowers   
 that brighten up the place.           
 All the way through the area there are
 a lot of footpaths which are very     
 interesting with some nice trees.
