		<content> HOLY TRINITY CHURCH IN S.W.F. SERVES  
 ROMAN CATHOLICS , CHURCH OF ENGLAND   
 AND METHODIST PARISHONERS. IT IS IN   
 THE TOWN CENTRE AND IN BETWEEN ST.    
 MARY'S C. OF E. PRIMARY SCHOOL AND ST.
 JOSEPH'S R.C. PRIMARY SCHOOL. THE TWO 
 SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY JOINED TO THE    
 CHURCH BY THEIR HALLS. PARTITIONS CAN 
 BE OPENED TO USE THE HALLS TO ENLARGEN
 THE CHURCH.                           
 THE DENOMINATIONS SHARE THE CHURCH BUT
 THE SCHOOLS DO HAVE THEIR OWN HEAD    
 TEACHERS AND GOVERNING BODIES.        
 THE ALTAR FURNITURE HAS BEEN HAND     
 CARVED BY MR. LES HOLDEN WHO LIVES IN 
 S.W.F. AND IS WELL KNOWN AS A LOCAL   
 HISTORY EXPERT.
