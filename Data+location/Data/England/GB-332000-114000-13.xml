		<title>13THE REBELLION CELEBRATIONS</title>
		<content> Charles 2nd was succeeded by his      
 brother James 2nd, but some people    
 wanted James Duke of Monmouth to be   
 king. The Duke of Monmouth sailed     
 from France to Lyme Regis and raised  
 an army mainly of farmers. And they   
 went on to Axminster then onto Chard  
 and through Ilminster and all over the
 west country, fighting. The final     
 battle was at Sedgemoor where the Duke
 was defeated on July 6th.1685.        
    Local people especially descendants
 of families who fought, have been     
 celebrating this last battle on       
 English soil.                         
   On Sunday June 16th 1985 There was  
 an Ilminster Pageant, The Pageant went
 by Broadway. Local people dressed up  
 as characters from the rebellion.
