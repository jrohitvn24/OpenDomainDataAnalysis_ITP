		<content> The villages of Fairlight, Guestling  
 and Pett, as well as Hastings Country 
 Park are popular with tourists.       
                                       
 The steep slopes and deep valleys of  
 Hastings Country Park and the         
 undulating nature of the surrounding  
 area provide scenic views from many   
 high points.  The sandstone cliffs of 
 the coastline attract many visitors.  
 There are many public footpaths       
 criss-crossing the Country Park and   
 throughout the area allowing tourists 
 and residents the opportunity to      
 explore the area.  An open-topped     
 double decker bus operates along      
 Fairlight Road during summer months.  
                                       
 In Pett there is a Methodist Church   
 dated 1948 and St Mary &amp; St Peter's   
 Parish Church. Guestling has a chapel 
 and Fairlight has two churches.       </content>
