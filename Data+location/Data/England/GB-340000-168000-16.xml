 maintained village hall where the     
 usual village clubs and organisations 
 meet e.g. W.I. meetings and Youth Club
 There are seven farms in{Kenn}- mostly
 dairy and beef farming. Some villagers
 are employed on the farms.{Stowell    
{Concrete Ltd.}employs {59}people and  
 has been at{Kenn}since about{1964}.   
  Back on{Clevedon Road,}you can see   
 the flag pole which flies the Union   
 Jack for both national and village    
 celebrations. Here too is the village 
 pub -{The Drum and Monkey}which, like 
 other old buildings in the village has
 an ancient well.Next door is{Tripp    
{Robbins}garage, which is sometimes    
 accused of not being "in keeping" with
 the village which competes annually   
 for (and in{1982}won) the{Best Kept   
{Village Competition.}Kenn is friendly,
 welcoming and justifiably proud.      </content>
