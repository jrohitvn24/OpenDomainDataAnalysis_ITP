		<content> The church is outside the village,near
 Milburn Beck.The building is an       
 aggregation of structures of various  
 ages, though the doorway is late      
 Norman &amp; similar masonry can be seen  
 along the lower parts of the building 
 on the S. side and scattered over     
 other walls of the church. Milburn    
 Mill was in use until 1925, but the   
 dam has collapsed and the water       
 conduit and the race ace in ruins.    
 The Village green is an oblong        
 measuring 800' by 250' and is         
 surrounded by houses facing the       
 green.In the past it is thought that  
 in winter cattle were put onto the    
 green for protection. The Maypole     
 stands on what is thought to be the   
 burial place of an ancient British    
 chieftan.One Maypole was erected in   
 1875,and the present one in 1984.
