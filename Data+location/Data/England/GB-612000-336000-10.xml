		<title>10PLANTATIONS</title>
		<content> THE PLANTATION IN THE AREA OF {       
{BACONSTHORPE }IS QUITE LARGE.IT MAINLY
 CONSISTS OF DECIDUOUS TREES SUCH AS   
 THE{OAK, ASH, BEECH &amp; LIME }ETC. A LOT
 OF NEW PLANTATIONS ARE BEING GROWN,   
 ESPECIALLY IN FIELDS WHERE NO CROPS   
 (SUCH AS WHEAT) ARE BEING GROWN. A LOT
 OF OLD PATHS HAVE BEEN OVERGROWN AND  
 FARMERS HAVE TURNED MANY OF THEM INTO 
 CROP LAND.}SEVERAL PATHS HAD BEEN KEPT
 OPEN FOR THE USE OF FARMERS &amp; TRACTORS
 BY THE EDGE OF FIELDS, BUT MOST OF    
 THEM HAD BEEN MAINTAINED IN MORE      
 POPULATED AREAS SUCH AS{GRESHAM       
{VILLAGE, FOR}THE USE OF THE           
 INHABITANTS. MORE PLANTATIONS HAVE    
 BEEN GROWN IN WHEAT AREAS BY THE LARGE
 LAND OWNERS SUCH AS THE MASTER OF     
 NORTH BARNINGHAM HALL. A LOT OF NEW   
 TREES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AROUND        
 HEDGEROWS &amp; FIELDS.
