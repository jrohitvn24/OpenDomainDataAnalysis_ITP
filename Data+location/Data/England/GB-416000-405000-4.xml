 Ivon Conroy lives above Jackson Bridge
 .In 1967 Conroy and Booth Ltd. was    
 formed by Mr.Conroy and his late uncle
 building at Ryefields, Scholes,on land
 owned by the family. Soon this grew   
 into an estate.Other local building   
 followed before they expanded to other
 parts of Yorkshire. By 1985 over 1000 
 homes had been built. Now C&amp;B employ  
 almost 150 people and have an annual  
 turnover of over Â£5 million. He       
 specialises in stonebuilt high        
 specification houses.It takes about 3 
 months to build an average house      
 costing Â£70,000. Mr.Conroy is         
 successful because he builds desirable
 houses, is easy to deal with, is well 
 organised and keeps to his promises.  
 Unfortunately he may move operations  
 to the more profitable Harrogate and  
 Leeds area.                           </content>
