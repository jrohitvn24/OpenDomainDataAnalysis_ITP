***********************************    
The houses in the area are made from   
bricks, and have tiled roofs. Many     
houses have garages or a drive, but    
others park on the road or go into a   
nearby block of garages.               
  Most gardens in the area are of      
reasonable size and quite a few of them
have open front gardens, but some have 
a surrounding hedge or wall.           
  The houses in Newton Aycliffe range  
from detached, semi-detached to        
bungalows and flats, their height      
ranging from one to four storeys high. 
The houses are fairly spaced out but   
not so far that people have to walk    
long distances. There are many new     
houses. Newton Aycliffe is a New Town  
built after the Second World War.
