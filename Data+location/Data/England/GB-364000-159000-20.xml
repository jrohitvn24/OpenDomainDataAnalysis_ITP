		<content>     We went around a lot of houses to 
 see if the people kept a pet. Of the  
 people owning a dog,three people had  
 Collies and two people had an         
 Alsation. Most pet rabbits are black  
 and white, or white on its own.Both   
 Tropical fish and Goldfish are very   
 popular. The favourite cat is the     
 Tortoiseshell.Less popular breeds kept
 were the Ginger,the Burmese,the Brown 
 Tabby,the Silver Tabby and the Grey.  
 Budgerigars are popular,but Canaries  
 are also great favourites. It seems   
 that people's Hamsters,Guinea-Pigs and
 Gerbils are mostly brown and white. At
 a farm we visited,they kept cows,     
 chickens,hens,geese,goats and sheep.
