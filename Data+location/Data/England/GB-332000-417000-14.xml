		<title>14Unemployment</title>
		<content> Unemployment in Southport is quite    
 high at present. The level in the     
 numbers of people without a job varies
 according to the seasons. We found    
 that because the  town is a seaside   
 resort that it had more jobs during   
 the summer than in the winter.Many    
 people get seasonal work on the       
 funfair,ice-cream stalls and souvenir 
 shops.                                
   The actual figures at the moment    
 are that about one fifth of the       
 working population are not employed.  
 This means that about four fifths are 
 working. The main employers are the   
 Health and Education authorities,     
 Service industries  and Restaurants   
 and Shops.
