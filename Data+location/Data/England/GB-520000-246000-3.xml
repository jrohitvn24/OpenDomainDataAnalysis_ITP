		<title>03THE PACKHORSE BRIDGE,SUTTON</title>
		<content>{The ford and Packhorse Bridge}form one
 of the most picturesque scenes in the 
 village.They provide a crossing place 
 on one of the tributaries of the River
 Ivel.The ford is a crossing place for 
 motor vehicles.It is passable at most 
 times,though following prolonged or   
 very heavy periods of rain,it is best 
 avoided.The Packhorse Bridge dates    
 back to the early 14th century,the    
 dating being made possible by the     
 shape of the two arches and the type  
 of stonework found on the parapet.    
 The bridge is used by cyclists and    
 pedestrians and there are passing     
 places built into the walls on either 
 side.It is the only bridge of its kind
 in Bedfordshire and is therefore very 
 popular amongst historians and artists
 and articles and sketches often appear
 in local magazines.A"tug-of-war"is    
 held annually through the ford.       </content>
