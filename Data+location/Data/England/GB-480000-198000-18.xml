		<content> MANY PEOPLE OWN CARS BUT THERE ARE    
{GOOD BUS SERVICES}THROUGH THE VILLAGES
 TO{HIGH WYCOMBE AND PRINCE RISBOROUGH,
 THENCE TO{AYLESBURY}AND ON. FARES ARE 
 NOT SUBSIDISED AND SO HIGHER THAN SOME
 AREAS BUT THERE IS A SCHEME TO ENABLE 
 OLDER PEOPLE TO TRAVEL MORE CHEAPLY.  
 SOME CHILDREN TRAVEL FREE TO SCHOOL ON
 THE NORMAL SERVICE BUSES WHILE OTHERS 
 HAVE A SPECIAL SCHOOL COACH. LOCAL    
 FACTORIES RUN VEHICLES TO PICK UP     
 EMPLOYEES AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR      
 HOSPITALS TO ARRANGE TRANSPORT FOR    
 PATIENTS WHERE THIS IS DIFFICULT.     
 THERE IS A{RAILWAY STATION AT SAUNDER-
{TON}AND SOME TRAINS STOP THERE ON THE 
 WAY TO AND FROM LONDON, BUT MOST      
 PEOPLE TRAVEL TO PRINCES RISBOROUGH OR
 HIGH WYCOMBE TO TAKE THE TRAIN, UNLESS
 THEY LIVE NEAR THE LOCAL STATION. IT  
 IS POSSIBLE TO PARK AT BOTH STATIONS.
