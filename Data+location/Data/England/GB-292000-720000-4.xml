		<title>04FARMING IN MADDERTY,1985</title>
		<content> This is mainly arable farmland.Barley 
 is the main crop,but winter wheat and 
 oil-seed rape are also grown. If the  
 barley is good quality it goes to the 
 distilleries to be made into whisky.  
 Poor quality barley goes to feed      
 cattle. Most farms have beef cattle,  
 we have no dairy herds. Fields of     
 grass are grown so that cattle can be 
 grazed or to make hay and silage.     
 There are pedigree Shorthorn and      
 Aberdeen-Angus cattle on two farms.   
 Some farmers have pedigree sheep      
 Suffolk or Border Leicester. One farm 
 breeds Clydesdale horses. There are   
 two pig farms and one chicken farm in 
 this area. Potatoes are grown for     
 seed-potatoes. The farms have good    
 modern farm-buildings and modern      
 machinery.
