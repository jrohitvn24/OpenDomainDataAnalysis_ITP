		<title>06BROWNIES</title>
		<content>    Brownies are helpful, friendly and 
 they lend a hand.   They are dressed  
 in brown and a yellow tie and brown   
 belt.   Our pack is called 1st        
 Helperby Pack and meets in the village
 hall on Monday nights.   In our pack  
 there are 17 brownies.   The brownies 
 have been twice to Lightwater Valley. 
 We have had a sausage sizzle, that is 
 a barbecue and played a few games. We 
 have sixes called Elves, Sprites,     
 Pixies, Imps, Gnomes, Irish           
 Lepricornsand many more.   When we    
 make our Promise we get a little      
 silver badge on the tie and some      
 badges.   We have a leader called     
 Brown Owl and helpers called Snowy Owl
 &amp; Tawny Owl.   When you are eleven you
 go on to guides.   Brownies have lots 
 of tasks to win badges for things like
 swimming, home help, dancing, safety  
 in the home etc.    Elizabeth Wise.   </content>
