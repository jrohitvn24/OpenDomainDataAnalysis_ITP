 the camp and all classified material  
 and information contained in it.The   
 security has been increased lately,due
 to the growth of{terrorist}movements. 
 The outskirts of the camp are         
 surrounded by a ditch with fences of  
 barbed wire around the top.There are  
 three entrances to{R.A.F. Brampton,   
 the main gate and two side gates.A    
 pass is needed to bring a car inside. 
 Visitors can obtain a temporary pass  
 from the guard office,just inside the 
 main gate.
