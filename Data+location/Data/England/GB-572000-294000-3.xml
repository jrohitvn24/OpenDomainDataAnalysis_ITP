 The chapel was built in 1857. We      
 intevewied the people who went to     
 chapel. Most of them got married in   
 chapel.They stay in chapel for one    
 hour.Three people go to chapel twice  
 on Sunday,s at 11 oclock and 7 oclock.
 Most people go to chapel every week.In
 chapel people sing,pray and generaly  
 help others. About 20 people go to    
 chapel at night and 12 people go in   
 the morning.On Monday's the chapel    
 organises refreshments for the Monday 
 market.The minister works on a circuit
 of several villages but lives in      
 Methwold.Other activities include     
 Sunday School (not many young         
 people attend!) and a Women's group.
