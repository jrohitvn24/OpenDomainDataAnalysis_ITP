		<content>    From the edge of Winter Hill to the
 east the marked north-south axis of   
 the communications stands out. Across 
 to the west Blackrod, possibly meaning
 "The Dark Way" holds the line of what 
 was an ancient ridgeway.Latterly this 
 became the A6 but such was the weight 
 of traffic through the tight main     
 street that the bypass was built below
 the village in the 1930s.             
    Another dark line across the view  
 is the Lancashire and Yorkshire       
 Railway of 1840, still an important   
 link from Manchester to the main line 
 north, with a station at the foot of  
 Blackrod.                             
    The M61 motorway is the next line  
 across the landscape,always seeming to
 carry more towards Manchester than it 
 carries away-apart from peak holiday  
 times. From the hillside our block    
 appears to be one people pass through!</content>
