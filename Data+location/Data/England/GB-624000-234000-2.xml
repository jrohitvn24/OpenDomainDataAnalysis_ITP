		<title>02The Port of Felixstowe</title>
		<content>  Felixstowe is a large and expanding  
port,handling containers,general cargo 
and passenger traffic.                 
  The Walton Container Terminal,built  
in 1982,is entirely in our block, as is
the new Trinity Terminal, at present   
being built.  During the past few      
months shingle has been dredged up from
the harbour and pumped on to the       
foreshore to form the foundations of   
Trinity Terminal.  This shingle is now 
being levelled and pile drivers are    
banging in long steel piles to form the
edge of the quay.                      
The Port of Felixstowe is the biggest  
employer in the area.  There are now   
1630 employees earning, on average,over
fifteen thousand pounds a year, as well
as many others working for the         
companies using the port. The success  
of the port helps to make Felixstowe   
and Trimley a very prosperous area .   </content>
