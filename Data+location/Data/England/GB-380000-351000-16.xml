		<content>My school is called Springhead County  
Primary School.It was opened in January
1961.It was named after the spring just
outside the school grounds.A new       
housing estate was built around that   
time in Talke Pits and the school was  
built so that children could go to     
school near their homes .Children come 
to Springhead when they are about five 
years old and leave when they are      
eleven.Then they have to go to Clough  
Hall Comprehensive School in           
Kidsgrove.The school has seven         
classrooms.Classes one,two and three   
are for infants and four,five,six and  
seven are for juniors.There used to be 
another infants school in Talke Pits   
called St.Martins.When it closed in    
1983, 18 of its children came to       
Springhead.Springhead has had three    
headmasters:Mr Gleaves,Mr Mountford and
Mr Newnes.                             </content>
