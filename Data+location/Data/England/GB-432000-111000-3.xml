		<title>03WOODLANDS VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Woodlands village has changed         
 considerably since about 195O. For    
 instance better roads have been built 
 and nowadays most families have at    
 least one car. There were once four   
 small shops in the village, now there 
 is only one which is owned by Mr. and 
 Mrs. Pullinger. The only pub in the   
 village is the Royal Oak where as     
 there used to be the Cricketer's Arms 
 which is now closed down.             
 Many years ago Woodlands House        
 belonged to General Sir Richard Lee   
 now it is used as an old people's     
 home. Another main feature of         
 Woodlands is Woodlands Farm. This was 
 once known as Home Farm because whole 
 families would live and work there,   
 but now it is a stud farm. Most people
 who live here work away from the      
 village and commute backwards and     
 forwards each day.                    </content>
