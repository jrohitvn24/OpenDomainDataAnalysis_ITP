		<title>09FRANKLEY - ATTITUDES &amp; VIEWS</title>
		<content> Most of the families coming to the    
 Frankley area from Birmingham have    
 been here for five to ten years.They  
 like the area's closeness to the      
 countryside  and yet  be within easy  
 reach of the city.They recognise the  
 problems such as teenage boredom      
 leading to violence,graffitti and     
 petty crime.To help combat this the   
 area has the only community policeman 
 based in a high school in the         
 country.The people have a variety of  
 views on things which would improve   
 the estate;increased sports and       
 leisure facilities such as a B.M.X.   
 track,swimming pool or cinema to      
 occupy young people.They would like to
 see more parks and open spaces for    
 families to use.They want better      
 transport and shopping facilities and 
 something done to remove graffitti and
 litter to improve the environment.    </content>
