		<title>01INTRODUCING COUNTESTHORPE</title>
		<content>                                       
   The  Countesthorpe area is in       
 Leicestershire, six miles from the    
 city centre.                          
   Countesthorpe is a large village    
 with simple shopping facilities.      
   There are quite a lot of fields and 
 open countryside.A lot of the land is 
 farmed and there are several small    
 farms in the area.                    
 The population of the area is         
 approximately eight and half thousand.
 There is a large age range but the    
 majority are young families;the       
 average age we think must be twenty   
 five.                                 
   About eighty per cent of the houses 
 are modern ones.The oldest house was  
 built in 1580 and the youngest houses 
 were built no more than twenty years  
 ago and the village is continuing to  
 grow.                                 </content>
