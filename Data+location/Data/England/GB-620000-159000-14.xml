		<title>14Fruit Farms, Wickhambreaux.</title>
		<content>     The farms in the{Grove Road}area  
 are dominantly fruit farms. At the    
 farm where my dad works they have two 
{strawberry}crops, one in the summer   
 and one in the autumn; after the      
 summer crop the tops are cut off the  
 plants and they grow again. This June 
 the strawberries were late because a  
{colorado beetle}was found last year so
 the crop had to be replanted.         
     The{apples, pears}and{strawberries
 are picked by hand and{blackcurrants  
 are picked with a machine that is     
 borrowed from another farm. There are 
 about twenty fields of{apples}and{    
{pears.}My mum is in charge of the     
 nursery for the workers' children.    
     My dad's boss farms four holdings,
 at Wickhambreaux, Westmarsh, Wingham  
 and Grove; the managers have walkie   
 talkie radios to communicate with each
 other.                                </content>
