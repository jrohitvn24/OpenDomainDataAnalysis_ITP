		<title>07SWAN GARAGE, WESTON.</title>
		<content> From a{Taxi and Car Hire}business     
 there has now been developed a garage 
 business , motor and lorry repairs.   
 There is a{24 hour heavy and light    
{breakdown service,}which serves the A1
 Stevenage Motorway, and extends to    
 Welwyn in the south, and Sandy in the 
 north. Now called{Swan Garage}it is   
 named after a pub that was built      
 in Weston but is not there any more.  
 There is also a Swan Garage in Hitchin
 another depot for heavy vehicles. The 
 partners in this business have lived  
 in the village for years and the      
 garage is very much a family concern. 
 The men work long hours because it is 
 a 24 hour service. Swan Garage is also
 a petrol{filling station,}there are   
 two pumps. The first hand crank petrol
 pump in Weston has now been moved to  
 Fairclough Hall Farm at Halls Green.
