		<content>The first motorway in the country,M    
1,runs beside the boundary of the      
area,close to Bricket Wood.            
For many years, there have been        
problems in the area from traffic      
congestion on the nearby main roads,   
making it difficult for people driving 
cars to actually get out of the        
villages.                              
Now,the last stretch of M25 to be laid,
runs through the area.At the moment,a  
wide stretch of clay runs through what 
was woods and fields;huge cranes and   
earth movers are everywhere,changing   
the landscape.It should be finished by 
1986, when the area will have fast     
access to all parts of the country.    
One bit of land is thought to be the   
most valuable piece of land,in Europe  
 if it is built on,and is called the   
'Golden Triangle'.Bricket Wood people  
want it to be kept as farmland.        </content>
