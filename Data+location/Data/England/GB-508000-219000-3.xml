		<content> GOING SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES            
 __________________________            
 There are thirty clothes shops in the 
 Arndale Centre.I have been in some of 
 the shops lots of times.Once I went in
 Mothercare and bought a T-Shirt.  The 
 T-Shirt was white.At Mothercare you   
 can buy lots of things like dresses,  
 shirts and shorts. There are so many  
 shops because people always want to   
 buy clothes.Also,clothes go out of    
 fashion, so people want different     
 clothes.                              
                                       
 HOT FOOD SHOPS                        
 ______________                        
 There are lots of takeaways in Luton. 
 They all sell different foods so      
 people have a good choice.  A takeaway
 like Macdonalds sells food such as    
 chips or hamburgers and drinks like   
 milkshakes.                           </content>
