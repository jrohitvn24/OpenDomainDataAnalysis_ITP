		<content> Although coal mining was once by far  
 the main industry in Barnsley, many   
 coal mines have now been closed       
 because the coal has been worked      
 out.However,Redbrook Colliery is one  
 which has just been extended at a cost
 of Â£34m.New administrative offices    
 have been built. There is a lamp room 
 where miners collect their lamps      
 before going down the mine. A new     
 shaft has been sunk, much wider than  
 the old one. Two large cages, holding 
 70 men, carry the miners up and down. 
 In the winding room, the "winders"    
 control the movement of the cages, by 
 turning the huge wheel to which cables
 from the cages are attached.There are 
 new baths where the miners wash after 
 their shift in the mine and a         
 warehouse where new equipment is kept,
 such as helmets, boots,explosives and 
 tools.                                </content>
