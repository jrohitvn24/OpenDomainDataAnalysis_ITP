		<title>09Warslow and Hulme End shops</title>
		<content>     The shop in {Warslow} has been run
by the same person for 47 years.  You  
can buy groceries, tobacco products and
petrol there.  Most local people buy   
their bread and papers there.  The shop
is open from 8.30a.m. until 6p.m.      
during the week and from 11a.m. until  
6p.m. at weekends.  The shop is stocked
up once a week from a cash and carry   
outlet in Hanley but the owner also    
buys things from local travelling      
shops.  Most of the custom is from     
locals.                                
     The shop in {Hulme End} sells many
things from fresh fruit and groceries  
to stationery and opens 7 days a week  
from 8.30a.m. until 7.30p.m.  It is    
stocked up once or twice a week from a 
cash and carry outlet in the Potteries.
Most custom comes from locals but the  
shop is busiest in the summer when     
campers are in nearby fields.          </content>
