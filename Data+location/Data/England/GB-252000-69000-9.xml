		<content>  We made  a survey of the 91 houses in
 Walkhampton, with a list of questions.
 1. How old were the houses?           
 -About 2/3 were{modern,}ie. built     
 since the Second World War, of which  
 the majority were council houses, most
 of which had been bought.             
  A private estate of 16 had been built
 in the last 5 years - expensive       
 detached houses.                      
 - 11 houses were built within the last
{100 years}- either detached or large  
 semi-detached. 2 were renovated.      
 - Another 14 were{over 100 years}-    
 tended to be small and terraced       
 2.What were the extra{features?}      
 -77 had telephones, twenty were double
 glazed. Thirty had garages. The oldest
 houses did not have gardens at the    
 front. The older houses had walled    
 gardens and the newest open plan      
 gardens.                              </content>
