		<title>19A Day in the life of....</title>
		<content>       Some people have school dinners,
 and some have packed lunches. We      
 finish lunch at 12:45 and have dinner 
 play. We come in at 1:15 and read     
 until register is called,then we do   
 rolling programme. For rolling        
 programme we do a rota of subjects    
 like art, computers, C.D.T (craft     
 design and technology),project,and    
 finishing our target work. At 2:30 we 
 stop to have play.                    
       After play we carry on doing    
 rolling programme until home time.    
 Some of us put the computers away then
 we go home. Some of us go home on the 
 school bus but most of us are either  
 collected by our parents or walk home.
 When we get home most of us have a    
 drink and something to eat and then   
 watch T.V. We play outside until 6pm, 
 when we have supper. We watch TV until
 bedtime, which is from 9pm on.        </content>
