     The Staffordshire and             
Worcestershire Canal runs from north   
to south through the middle of the     
block. This is much used in the summer 
by holiday cruisers. There are locks   
at Dunsley and Stourton.               
    The A449 trunk road runs parallel  
to the canal. Where it by-passes Kinver
it is a dual carriageway. It is a very 
busy road for traffic going from       
Wolverhampton to the South and linking 
with the M5 near Worcester.            
     There are many footpaths and      
bridle-paths in the area. Most of them 
are passable. The Kinver Civic Society 
has published a map and guide.         
     Not far north of the block is     
Halfpenny Green Airfield. This is much 
used by light aircraft.
