		<content> Once a month a service is held in the 
 old Fellside school at which all      
 members of other denominations are    
 welcomed. Residents attend regular    
 Church of England and Methodist       
 services in Caldbeck.                 
 The main annual event is the Harvest  
 Festival, held in the old school on   
 the last Sunday in October. The       
 service is followed by tea and is     
 always well attended. On the following
 Monday there is a Harvest (Kurn)      
 supper and social evening. Fellside   
 school is also the venue for evening  
 classes and fund-raising events.      
 Caldbeck Mothers' Union meets there   
 once a year.                          
 Foxhunting is a very old local custom,
 necessary to control the number of    
 foxes which threaten farm stock and   
 poultry. The pack and followers hunt  
 on foot.                              </content>
