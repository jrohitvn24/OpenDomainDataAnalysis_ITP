		<content> SEWAGE WORKS. WE VISITED WILLINGTON   
 SEWAGE TREARMENT WORKS. IT WAS BUILT  
 IN 1966 TO SERVE WILLINGTON AND       
 COPLE.THE BROWNISH GREY SEWAGE WATER  
 IS CLEANED SO THAT IT CAN GO INTO THE 
 RIVER.                                
 THERE IS A BIG RAKE WHICH SCRAPES     
 LARGE RUBBISH OFF A GRID, THEN THE    
 LIQUID GOES TO A SETTLING TANK WHERE  
 THE RUBBISH AT THE BOTTOM CAN BE      
 REMOVED. THIS IS TAKEN TO THE BIG     
 SEWAGE WORKS IN BEDFORD,TREATED AGAIN,
 THEN USED AS FERTILISER BY THE        
 FARMERS.                              
 THE NEXT STAGE IS THE AERATION TANK   
 WHEN AIR IS PUMPED INTO A TANK AND    
 MICROBES HELP KILL GERMS.NEXT THE     
 SEWAGE LEFT SETTLES AND THE CLEANER   
 WATER GOES INTO THE RIVER THROUGH A   
 PIPE.LATER IT IS TREATED AGAIN AT THE 
 WATER WORKS SO WE CAN DRINK IT.
