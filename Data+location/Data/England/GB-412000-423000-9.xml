		<content> I have 5 hrs. of leisure time from    
 when I get home at 3.45 until 9 p.m.  
 Mainly I spend my time outside        
 riding my bike or going fishing.I     
 watch T.V.rarely.I have been angling  
 for 4 years now. Sometimes I go to the
 canal and sometimes to the River      
 Calder.It cost me Â£1 each time I      
 go.The main things involved are       
 knowing how to tie knots and knowing  
 where the fish will be and at what    
 depth. I have a B.M.X.bike which I    
 ride near my house at the swing field.
 This is near the football pitch. We   
 use the railway banking as a          
 ramp.Sometimes I go along Bradford    
 Rd. to a place we call Devil's        
 Ditch.This is on the old railway      
 banking near Wellholme Park. We do    
 practise jumps and have a height      
 competition.I wear a safety helmet and
 pads on my knees and elbows.          </content>
