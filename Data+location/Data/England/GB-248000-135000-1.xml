		<title>01Local History of Braunton.</title>
		<content> Braunton is an{Anglo-Saxon settlement 
 supposedly founded by{St.Brannock}in  
 the ninth century.Braunton or         
 "Brantona", is mentioned in the       
{Domesday book}as having been a manor  
 in the name of the king.Today, it is  
 an expanding village unique in being  
 one of the few places to still have a 
 large{open field,}one of only a few   
 left in the country.It was a{thriving 
{port,}but nowadays it concentrates on 
 attracting{new technology, and a large
{tourist industry.}It has a            
{comprehensive school,several primaries
 and ample facillities, including a    
 recently opened {shopping centre}and  
 links to local towns.However,the local
 children have few{formal amusements.  
{Tourism}tends to inflate prices but,  
 the{climate}is a compensation to local
 inhabitants.
