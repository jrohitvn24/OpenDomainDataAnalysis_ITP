		<content> The main window records Queen         
 Victoria's 60 year long reign with the
 dates 1837 and 1897 etched in the     
 glass. The organ is about 80 years old
 and is sited in the gallery where the 
 choir sits and sings on Sundays.      
   The Sunday School is held above the 
 village post office. The grave stones 
 are made of Portland stone. The       
 graveyard is now full so there are no 
 more burials here. In 1984 the church 
 interior was rebuilt and new chairs   
 replaced the old pews. They have even 
 had a bulldozer in the church!
