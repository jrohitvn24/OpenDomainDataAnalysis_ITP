		<content> The D Block lies half way between     
 Littleport in the North and Ely to the
 South. Part of it covers{Padnal}which 
 comes from old English and means place
 of the frog. In the extreme right-hand
 corner block, lies Prickwillow which  
 has a population of some{four hundred 
{people.}It is one of the lowest places
 in England, some land being two feet  
 below the River. This has made the    
 drainage of the waterfilled Peat      
 difficult and has only been           
 accomplished by the re-routing of the 
 River by what's known as the{New Cut.}
 Several wind pumps had kept the land  
 relatively dry, but when the River no 
 longer went to Prickwillow, a drain   
 was dug and a series of modern diesel 
 /electric pumps were installed by the 
 Bridge at Prickwillow to pump out at  
 Cross Cut (River Lark). Farmers say   
 Peat shrinks height of man,in his life</content>
