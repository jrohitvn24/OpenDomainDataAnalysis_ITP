		<title>06NEW HOUSING ON CLEE HILL</title>
		<content>    {Park View Estate}on Clee Hill is  
 the only new housing development in   
 our area. The plan is to build 101    
 bungalows all with a living room,     
 bathroom, kitchen, and two bedrooms.  
 They will have double glazing, central
 heating, fitted carpets, Telecom and  
 T.V sockets, a car port or garage if  
 desired, and a garden. The central    
 heating will be electricity, oil or   
 solid fuel. There will be no gas      
 because there is no supply running up 
 to Clee Hill. The price range is      
 between Â£27,500 to Â£34,500. This      
 Estate has a beautiful view and is    
 near the common land.                 
                                       
     In June 1985 they started to build
 three bungalows. If they sell well    
 they will build more in the future.
