		<title>11LOCAL BUS SERVICES</title>
		<content>   There are{three bus services}in our 
 survey area.Two go through            
 Westerleigh.The 325 is the most       
 important because it links Yate,      
 Westerleigh and all the little places 
 with Bristol.It runs every hour during
 most of the day but there are{none on 
{Sunday.}The 236 also passes through   
 Westerleigh but goes south to Bath.It 
 only runs (2 a day)on Wednesday and   
 Saturdays,probably for shopping trips.
   In the very south of our area is the
 row of old mining houses at Parkfield.
 A bus,the 389,finishes its journey    
 here a few times each weekday,having  
 come from Bristol.                    
   We have noticed that nearly all the 
 buses are single-deckers but with some
 double-deckers on route 325 during    
 busy times.They look funny going along
 the small country roads.
