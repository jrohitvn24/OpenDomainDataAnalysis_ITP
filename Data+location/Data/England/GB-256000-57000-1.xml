		<content>   Of these three villages Sparkwell   
 is the largest. (Details of each      
 village can be found under separate   
 headings.)                            
   The area is largely given over to   
 dairy farming with some beef cattle   
 and sheep. There is a small amount of 
 coniferous woodland grown for its     
 timber and a larger amount of         
 deciduous woodland. To the north of   
 the area there is a china clay works  
 which also supplies a concrete block  
 making works. Just north of Sparkwell 
 village is a large open-cast wolfram  
 mine which was closed down after the  
 Second World War. Recent proposals to 
 re-open this mine have been met with  
 opposition by conservation groups. A  
 decision by the government is expected
 shortly.                              
   Sparkwell small primary school is   
 threatened by falling rolls.          </content>
