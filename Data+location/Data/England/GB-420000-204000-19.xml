		<content>The two larger farms (both managed)    
farm sheep which are kept out in summer
and brought in for winter lambing. Var-
ieties include Border, Leicester and   
Cheviot cross with Suffolk rams. Betwe-
en the two farms 730 lambs are produced
annually.                              
One farm has a dairy herd of 100 cows  
with 35 followers. They are kept loose 
in large sheds in the winter, free to  
roam. 1,300 tons of silage is fed to   
them over 200 days from beginning of   
September till mid-April. Another farm 
keeps 50 beefstock cattle outside to   
graze excess grass.                    
There are 19 people working on these   
four farms, plus 4 students at harvest 
time. On one farm 8\ people work (the  
half, a part-time secretary). Many     
machines are used on the farms. Each   
has at least 1 combine harvester and 1 
farm uses 5 landrovers &amp; 4 tractors.   </content>
