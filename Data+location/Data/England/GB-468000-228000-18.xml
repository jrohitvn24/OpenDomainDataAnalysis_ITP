		<title>18PROGRESS IN PADBURY</title>
		<content> One of the most important, if not the 
 major, event of 1985 in Padbury must  
 be that the gas main has arrived. A   
 gas pipe is finally being laid down   
 the main street, a fact which is      
 welcomed by many. That this is due, in
 part, to the efforts of a builder     
 building new houses at one end of the 
 village may persuade some older       
 residents that there are some         
 advantages in new housing after all.  
 Something else which is welcomed by   
 all residents is the Padbury          
 Newsletter. Published by the village, 
 for the village, the newsletter is    
 delivered to every household every    
 other month. It gives a resume of past
 events and all the relevant           
 information about coming events. For  
 the last two years the front cover has
 shown photographs or drawings of old  
 Padbury of interest to us all.        </content>
