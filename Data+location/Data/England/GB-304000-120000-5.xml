		<content>           STAWLEY                     
       The northern part of our block, 
 where Stawley is situated, is steep   
 hills and deep valleys.               
       Tucks Farm, to the northwest of 
 Stawley, is very old. There are a lot 
 of old buildings there. Close by,at   
 Bennets, there is an orchard. There   
 are about ten apple trees there.      
       By Tucks Farm there is an old   
 track.The track goes through a ford   
 and there is also a bridge.           
       There is an old watermill - but 
 it has no longer got a wheel and is   
 now a house. It has a lovely garden.  
       There is a beautiful little     
 church at Stawley but very few houses 
 and they are far apart.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
