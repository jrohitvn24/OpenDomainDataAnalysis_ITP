		<title>05INWOOD, BATCH AND CWM DALE</title>
		<content>  { Inwood}is a small valley. It is set
 in the{Long Mynd}hill, north of Church
 Stretton. It is a nice quiet little   
 valley with a stream and road going   
 through. It is good in winter because 
 you can go down the hills on your     
 sledge. It is a very brackeny place.  
{   Batch}valley is a peaceful place in
 the middle of All Stretton village. It
 has four houses and one holiday house.
 You can't drive very far but there is 
 a small car park. A stream flows      
 through Batch valley.                 
   {Cwm Dale,}another small valley     
 surrounded by hills has only a private
 road. There are a few houses one of   
 which used to be a shepherd's hut.    
 Pony trekking is popular in Cwm Dale. 
    They are all attractive unspoilt   
 valleys with plenty of wildlife but   
 sometimes there can be lots of        
 tourists.                             </content>
