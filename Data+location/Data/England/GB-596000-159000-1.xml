      Our D-Block is situated to the   
 west of the town of{Faversham.}It     
 contains many of the features of the  
{Kentish}countryside that give rise to 
 the name:{"The Garden of England".    
 Most of the land is intensively farmed
 with orchards,soft fruit,sheep and    
 hops the main land users. Woodland    
 still survives much as coppice.       
 Footpaths criss-cross the block and   
 are increasingly being used. Many fine
 buildings still exist usually as      
 isolated farms or small communities.  
      Three major transport networks   
 pass through the block. The newest is 
 the M2 motorway ,which bisects the    
 southern corner. To the north is the  
 railway and running parallel the A2,  
 being for hundreds of years the only  
 road from London to Dover,via         
 Canterbury.                           </content>
