		<content> Speed restrictions have recently been 
 imposed on certain roads in and around
 the village after consistent pressure 
 from local people concerned at the    
 volume of heavy traffic passing       
 through on a regular basis. Milk      
 tankers, and lorries belonging to a   
 nearby engineering works, are felt by 
 many to be a constant potential       
 hazard. The routes they take have been
 altered and their speed restricted to 
 a certain degree.                     
                                       
 New housing is another matter of local
 concern. Opinions are varied but there
 is a strong feeling that the character
 of the village must be retained and   
 the older buildings safeguarded.
