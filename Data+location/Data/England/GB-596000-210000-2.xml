		<title>02Our Family</title>
		<content> There are four people in our family.  
  My Dad and Mum, Mark my brother and  
 myself.   My dad is an electrician.   
 He fits in controllers, plug switches,
 light bulbs and he sometimes wires up 
 houses.   He sometimes lets me come   
 with him when he puts light bulbs in  
 flats.   My dad also likes fishing and
 I sometimes go too.   My mum has no   
 job apart from typing letters for dad 
 answering buisness phone-calls.   I   
 sometimes answer the phone calls too. 
 My brother Mark is 8 years old.    He 
 is a bit of a nuisance at times.      
 Like most boys he likes riding        
 his bike.   I sometimes  play cricket 
 with him.   About myself.   My name   
 is Nicola, I am 10 years old.   I like
 reading, pop music, maths and         
 roller-skating.   Me and my brother   
 leave home to school about 8.50.
