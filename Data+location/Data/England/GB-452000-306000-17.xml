		<content> The{butchers shop}opened in 1927 but  
 the building is much older than that. 
 It was probably built about three     
 hundred years ago and therefore in the
 Elizabethan style.                    
                                       
 At the front you can see four windows.
 Inside the shop there are black beams 
 along the ceiling and a big black     
 chimney.                              
                                       
 The actual shop is quite small,the    
 butcher having the same amount of room
 as his customers.                     
                                       
 The people who own it now are called  
 Chaplin and Sons. Everyday the butcher
 has to chop one bullock, six sheep and
 two pigs into different cuts of meat.
