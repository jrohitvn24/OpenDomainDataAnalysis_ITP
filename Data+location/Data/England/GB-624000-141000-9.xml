		<title>09ST.RADIGUNDS ABBEY BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> The Abbey was built of Caen stone,    
 Kentish ragstone and flints.The 13th  
 century church had a large nave,a     
 choir with north and south transepts, 
 a presbytery and a Lady chapel.The    
 living quarters for the canons        
 consisted of a refectory, kitchen,    
 chapter house,infirmary and large     
 guest quarters.The whole establishment
 was surrounded with strong stone walls
 and deep fosses.Two gate houses were  
 built with the main entrance on the   
 north side connecting with woodland   
 tracks to Alkham,Buckland and River.  
 Outside the great fosse were fields   
 tended by the canons and lay workmen. 
 Today the tower of the abbey church is
 an arched entrance way, the old       
 refectory a mellowed farmhouse and    
 guest quarters a great barn.The many  
 smaller buildings are now outhouses.  
 Cloister ruins remain.                </content>
