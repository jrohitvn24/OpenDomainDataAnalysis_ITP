 This year there have been no major    
 crimes in Silver End, but there was 1 
 case of murder in Coggeshall,6-7 miles
 away.3 domestic arguments were noted, 
 but fortunately no assaults occurred. 
 P.C.Miller attended 8 road accidents  
 but there were no serious injuries.In 
 the case of theft,no cars were stolen 
 but four bikes were taken.There is the
 occasional act of foolish vandalism,  
 usually directed at public property,  
 but Silver End is a law-abiding,safe  
 and happy village.
