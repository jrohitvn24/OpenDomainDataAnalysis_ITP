This rural school has about 100 pupils 
on role. It is a fairly modern         
building, built to accomodate the      
merging of three local smaller parish  
schools some fourteen years ago.       
At present, pupils come by various     
means of transport; private cars,      
walking, school bus and taxi.The taxi  
brings in a small number of pupils who 
live in outlying areas, but the rest of
the children seem equally divided      
between the other means of getting to  
school.                                
There are five teachers, one part-time,
including the Headmaster,one secetary, 
one ancillary assistant, one           
cleaner/caretaker and five dinner      
ladies.
