		<content> There is proof that the chancel was   
 there, because the churchyard path is 
 going round an empty space.In 1278 the
 Archdeacon of Ely visited the church  
 because the Bishop of Ely owned the   
 village.The earliest recorded rector  
 in the church was Nicholas de         
 Houton.He was the rector in           
 1320.Nicholas Breakspeare was a curate
 at the church.Later he became the only
 English pope,Adrian IV.               
 Neither the church nor the village is 
 mentioned in Domesday Book.This may be
 because  the village was not founded  
 in 1086,but is more probably because  
 all the manors belonging to the Abbot 
 of Ely were included in the entry for 
 Wisbech.
