		<title>07 FOLKESTONE HARBOUR</title>
		<content>   Folkestone Harbour is owned by      
Sealink British Ferries. Together with 
their operation of the cross-Channel   
ferries, this makes the company one of 
the largest employers in the district. 
About 280 people work in the harbour   
area.                                  
   The commercial part of the harbour  
has the facilities for handling        
passengers arriving by train at the    
harbour station and vehicles for       
loading on board the ferries for the   
crossing to France.                    
   The new Orient Express train uses   
Folkestone Harbour, travelling from    
London on Tuesdays and Thursdays.      
   The other part of the harbour is    
very picturesque and is used by fishing
boats and private vessels. It is always
popular with tourists, as many         
colourful boats can be seen.
