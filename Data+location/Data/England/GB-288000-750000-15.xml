{A interview with Mr.H.Steuart         
{Fothringham of Grantully Castle.      
 Mr. Fothringham,the owner,has lived in
 Grantully Castle for twenty years.He  
 moved in on the 1st November 1964.The 
 first part of the castle was built    
 around 1400 and was finally finished  
 in 1890.It was built by{Sir Alexander}
{Steuart}of Grantully.It is said by    
 some people that{the first castle}was 
 by St.Mary's Church but other people  
 say it was by the river at Laidneskea.
 It is very cold sometimes living in   
 the castle,the warmest room is the    
 kitchen because the cooker is always  
 on.If it gets too cold,the only thing 
 to do is put on another coat or light 
 the fire.                             
 In the{dungeon}it is very damp and    
 there are no windows.It is very small 
 and about 4feet under ground level.   </content>
