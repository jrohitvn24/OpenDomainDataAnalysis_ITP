		<title>05Marston, Moat Farm</title>
		<content> This is perhaps the most noteworthy   
 building in Marston.It is a cruck-    
 framed farmhouse completely enclosed  
 by a moat.                            
 The Snagge family lived here from 1562
 - 1712.Thomas Snagge was the M.P.for  
 Bedford and the speaker of the House  
 of Commons in the reign of Elizabeth  
 1.His son was M.P. for Bedford County 
 in 1588 and High Sheriff in 1607.The  
 house declined in fortune in the 18th 
 century but was bought by the Duke of 
 Bedford in 1858 and 'modernised'as a  
 farmhouse in 1880.It survives today as
 one of the best examples of a moated  
 farmhouse and has recently been       
 restored and converted into a         
 restaurant which opened in August     
 1985.It seats 40 downstairs and 20 -  
 25 upstairs and is run by the         
 proprietor,2 chefs and an apprentice  
 and 14 staff.Food is in English style.</content>
