		<content> The{football club}use a field which   
 belongs to one of the farms.          
 The only{Church}in our area is also   
 situated in Upottery.                 
 There are few other facilities in the 
 village.Only the recently built Oak   
 Tree Close has street lights.         
 Upottery does not even have a{post    
{office}any longer but there is one in 
 nearby{Rawridge.}                     
 There is a{garage}where you can also  
 obtain petrol on the {A.303 road.}    
 The only public transport is a bus    
 which takes people to market in       
 Taunton once a week.                  
  A relatively recent development has  
 been the{Post Bus}service.On certain  
 journeys in the Upottery and Honiton  
 area the Post Office uses a mini-bus  
 instead of a van and this carries     
 passengers on each journey.This is    
 useful as people heve to shop in town.</content>
