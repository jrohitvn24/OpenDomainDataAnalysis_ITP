		<content>    We decided to do a survey of houses
 in our area.  The best way to find out
 information was by asking our parents 
 on a questionnaire.  We put the       
 address of our school then a short    
 sentence explaining what we were      
 doing.  The letter was given to all   
 the 1st year children in Grange M.S.  
    The first question was"What kind of
  a house do you live in?" The results 
 were- semi-detached 17, bungalow 0,   
 terrace 9, detached 3, cottage 0, flat
 1.  We received 31 slips.             
    When asked why they chose to live  
 in this area the answers were very    
 different, but most came for          
 convenience near shops or work and    
 because they like being near the      
 country.  6 houses were built         
 after 1945, 13 1918-1939, 10 1837-1914
 and none before that.
