		<content>{In}Windsor Forest there is a ghost.   
 Some say it is the anciend forest god,
 some say it's Herne the Hunter, keeper
 of Windsor Forest. Herne has a body of
 a man with antlers on his head.       
{Legend}says that in winter at still of
 midnight, he walks around a great oak 
 tree, with great ragged horns. He     
 blasts the tree, takes the cattle,    
 makes the milking cows give blood and 
 shakes the tree in a hideous and      
 dreadful manner.                      
{One}night about twenty years ago, sone
 boys found a horn at the edge of      
 Windsor Forest. They blew it, and at  
 once a horn answered from deep in the 
 wood. Then came the baying of hounds, 
 and Herne the hunter appeared, riding 
 on a black horse his ragged horns dark
 against the sky.Terrified,the boys    
 dropped the horn and ran.
