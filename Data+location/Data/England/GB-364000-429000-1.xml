		<title>01Review of the area</title>
		<content> The area is situated to the NNW of    
 Blackburn. It is dominated by two     
 steep sided ridges, Revidge in the    
 South and Ramsgreave / Mellor in the  
 North, along both of which lie housing
 developments.                         
 Three major trunk roads cross the     
 area providing good access to         
 neighbouring towns and the M6 Motorway
 .Despite a good network of roads the  
 area has many quiet places to spend a 
 little time wandering the many        
 footpaths and minor roads. The route  
 from Mellor to the Top of Ramsgreave  
 provides excellent views, in fine     
 weather, of the scenic Ribble Valley  
 to the North and the Longridge fells  
 beyond, to the South the outskirts of 
 Blackburn. The area has throughout a  
 contrast of housing development from  
 very old cottages to modern housing   
 estates to luxury homes.              </content>
