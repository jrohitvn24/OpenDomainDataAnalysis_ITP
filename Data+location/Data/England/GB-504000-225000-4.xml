{PREVIOUS PAGE)}                       
 One of the fields has the M1 passing  
 through it, another has sold his      
 fields to a private building company  
 who has built a new housing estate    
 which has cut an old farm off in the  
 middle of a building estate.          
 The farm which sold the land to the   
 building company is shortly getting   
 houses built around it and will soon  
 be swallowed up by the development,the
 farm still has sufficient land to     
 produce it's crops of wheat. The      
 farmers mainly use machinery on their 
 farms. Most of the farmers having     
 electricity pylons on their fields.
