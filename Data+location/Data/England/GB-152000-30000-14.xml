		<content>    THE AREA IS PRIMARILY RURAL AND    
 PROVIDES A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS FOR
 WILD LIFE BOTH FLORA AND FAUNA.THERE  
 IS WOODLAND,HEATHLAND,GRASSLAND,MARSH-
 LAND,CULTIVATED LAND AND THE SEA AND  
 BEACH.                                
    ALL OF THESE HABITATS ARE READILY  
 ACCESSIBLE AS THE AREA IS WELL        
 PROVIDED WITH FOOTPATHS WHICH ARE     
 REASONABLY WELL MAINTAINED BY THE     
 LOCAL COUNCILS. WALKERS,BIRDWATCHERS  
 AND ARTISTS FIND MUCH OF INTEREST.    
    BEING SITUATED WHERE THE PENINSULA 
 IS NARROW, THE WEATHER CAN BE         
 UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY VARY OVER QUITE 
 SHORT DISTANCES.STRONG WINDS BLOWING  
 FOR SEVERAL DAYS CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE.
 FOG AND SEA MISTS ARE NOT UNCOMMON.   
    THERE IS NO INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION   
 AND IT IS A PLEASANT PLACE TO LIVE.
