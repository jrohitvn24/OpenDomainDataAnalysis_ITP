		<title>10Listed Buildings in Horton</title>
		<content> Eighteen houses in Horton are listed  
 buildings, as is the Norman &amp;         
 Perpendicular Church.  Five of the    
 houses are initialled and dated, the  
 earliest date being 1712 and the      
 latest 1801.  All the houses listed   
 are either 17th or 18th Century, some 
 with later additions and most have    
 been altered in some way to keep pace 
 with changes in living patterns.      
 Brackenbottom Farm has a fine         
 ornamental plasterwork ceiling in one 
 room and a panelled wall incorporating
 a cupboard with a carved pediment.    
 Rowe House has a Georgian staircase   
 and a room with a Georgian fire place 
 and cupboard.  All the listed         
 buildings are built of rubble.  Many  
 have mullioned windows with dripstones
 over and some have moulded doorheads. 
 A few still have glazing bars in the  
 windows.  Horton Bridge is listed.    </content>
