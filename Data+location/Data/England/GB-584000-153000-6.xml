		<title>06THE HARSH WINTER OF 1981/2</title>
		<content>     The winter of 1981/2 was a        
 particularly cold one and caused many 
 problems in the area. The village     
 school was badly effected with all    
 running water and the toilets freezing
 solid for many days. It was kept open 
 but many children, particularly those 
 living up on the Downs, were unable to
 get in for a whole week.              
     The heavy snow in the new year    
 caused the roof of Harrietsham's cub  
 hut to collapse and the cubs have had 
 to use the local school while         
 rebuilding and repairs are carried    
 out.                                  
     Hollingbourne School's Christmas  
 production was The Snowman which      
 turned out to be very appropriate as  
 snowmen were a feature of the school  
 playing field for many weeks after the
 Christmas holidays.
