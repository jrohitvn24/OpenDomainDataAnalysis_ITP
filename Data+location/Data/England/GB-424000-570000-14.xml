Leader shouts out colours. If she says,
"Red" you must stop, Amber means walk  
and green means run. If you move on any
other colour, then you are out.        
 Sometimes we have to go into our      
groups for badges. At the moment I am  
doing my Pathfinder badge, which is a  
badge where you have to draw maps.     
 1985 is the 75th year of Guiding. On  
Tuesday, 25th June 1985 all the Guides,
Rangers and Brownies from N. Tyneside  
went to Tynemouth to see the Flame of  
Friendship come in on H.M.S. Jersey. A 
Brownie, a Guide and a Ranger went to  
Buckingham Palace to ask Princess      
Margaret to light the flame and it     
burned all day and all night. We       
watched the boat come into the Tyne and
dock. Afterwards we had a camp fire and
sing-song and the newspaper camera-man 
came.                                  </content>
