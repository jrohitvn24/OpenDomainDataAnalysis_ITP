		<content>{Tickhill Castle}is a{motte}and{bailey}
 castle.It belongs to The Duchy of     
 Lancaster who is{The Queen.}The       
 Borough Council was going to do the   
 work but it was too expensive but they
 offered to do some restoration and the
 Department of Environment might do the
 rest.DMBC had 24 workers from{Manpower
{Services Commission}18 months ago.They
 chartered all the undergrowth from    
 standing masonry.A team of hardworking
 archlaeologists have made detailed    
 plans.They have the money for another 
 year's work.The{Castle Open Day}last  
 summer,had 4,000 people attending.Some
 masonry is still unsafe,to correct it,
 French lime must be used.Newspapers   
 recently report that the castle may go
 to members of the Society for the     
 Protections of Buildings.The more     
 support,the more promising it will be.
