		<title>18Games Children Play 1</title>
		<content> One of the games that we play is      
 called 'Sly Foxie'.  It is also called
 'Hot Chocolate', 'Hot Frogs' and      
 'Wolf'.  More than two people are     
 needed to play this game.  One of the 
 people is "it" and they stand facing a
 wall.  This person has to say "1, 2, 3
 Sly Foxie" and then turn around while 
 all the others try to walk to the wall
 without being seen. If anyone is seen 
 moving by the person turning round    
 then they have to stand with one hand 
 touching the wall until they are      
 released by someone else touching     
 their shoulder.  If everyone gets     
 caught the person who was "it" tells a
 story and at the end of the story she 
 chases the other children and the     
 first one she catches is "it" for the 
 next game.
