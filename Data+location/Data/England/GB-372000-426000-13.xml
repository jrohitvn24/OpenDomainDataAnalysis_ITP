 The railway was never extended to     
 Oswaldtwistle and residents here have 
 to go to Church (about l to 2 miles)  
 to get a train.  It is a multiple     
 track system and is on an embankment  
 for most of the way.  There are two   
 main peak times, 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 
 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.  It is a slow train  
 and a conductor comes around for your 
 fare rather like on a bus.  One part  
 of the railway lines has an           
 interesting name.  Where the railway  
 bridge crosses Blackburn Road the     
 surrounding area is known as "2O      
 steps".  This is because at one time  
 it was possible to go up onto the     
 bridge and down again (26 steps up and
 2O down the other side).
