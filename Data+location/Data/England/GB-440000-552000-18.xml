		<title>18Ryhope Shopping Centre</title>
		<content>{   Ryhope}has a fairly big and modern 
{shopping centre.}We think it caters   
 very well for people. We surveyed what
 people thought about the shopping     
 centre in{Ryhope.                     
    The majority of people are         
 satisfied with the shops because they 
 cater for their needs, except when    
 people need clothes they have to go   
 elsewhere. Those who did not use the  
 shopping{centre}decided not to, either
 because of the variety of shops the   
 town centre offered, or they did not  
 live in Ryhope.                       
    When we asked people how they      
 thought the{shopping centre}in{Ryhope 
 could be improved some people wanted  
 somewhere for their children to play  
 while they were in the shops, while   
 other people thought it should be     
 cleaner.                              
                                       </content>
