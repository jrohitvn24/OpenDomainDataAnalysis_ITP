		<title>02       WAITROSE</title>
		<content>  We interviewed the manager of        
 Waitrose, the largest food supermarket
 serving Sheen and surrounding areas.  
  It employs up to 170 people, 70      
 full-time, 35 part-time and the rest  
 made up of students at weekends and   
 evenings. All part-time staff are     
 local, as are some full-time staff.   
  It covers 1200 square feet of shop   
 area, which is average for such shops.
 Most customers are local, but some    
 shop on their way home from work.     
  The store gets up to 40 deliveries a 
 day from a central warehouse in       
 Bracknell, plus some straight from    
 manufacturers (six different suppliers
 of bakery products alone!) They sell a
 large range of branded goods as well  
 as own-brand goods, some of which are 
 by the same makers as the branded     
 produce.   Average bill - 6  pounds;  
 average price - 57 pence.             </content>
