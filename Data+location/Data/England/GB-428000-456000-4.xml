		<title>04ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, BILTON</title>
		<content>    The correct name of Bilton Church  
 is The Parish Church of St. John the  
 Evangelist. It was designed by{Sir    
{Gilbert Scott}and completed in 1857.  
 Old drawings of the church show a     
 steeple but this was taken down in the
 early 1970's. The total cost was met  
 by{William Sheepshanks,}his son Thomas
 was the first vicar. The Sunday school
 was built in 1897 as was the Vicarage 
 which is now used as a library. The   
 churchyard was quite large and 1600   
 people have been buried in the        
 graveyard.                            
    In the early 1960's the floor and  
 pews were replaced. The church now has
 a narthex, and the organ and choir    
 stalls are at the west end. The spiral
 staircase is narrow and leads up the  
 tower first to a room behind the organ
 pipes.
