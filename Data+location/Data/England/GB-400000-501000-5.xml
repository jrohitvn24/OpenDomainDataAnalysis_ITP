		<title>05SHOOTING SEASON</title>
		<content> The{grouse shooting  season}starts on 
 August 12th.The gamekeeper has one    
{labrador}and 3{spaniels}to help him.  
 During the season the gamekeeper's job
 is to organise the allocation of      
{shooting butts}to the shooter.  The   
 shooters come from all over the world.
 Each butt is numbered.  The shooters  
 take a stick with a number on it and  
 shoot from the butt with that number. 
 The gamekeeper then has to tell the   
{beaters}where to stand and when to    
 start to beat. About 20 or 30 beaters 
 are employed. They stand in a long    
 line and wave flags.This makes the    
 grouse fly up so they can be shot.    
  After the shoot the grouse are taken 
 back to the keeper's house and put    
 into the game larder.The beater       
 receives Â£10 for each days            
 shooting.The game dealer collects the 
 grouse and it is taken to be sold.    </content>
