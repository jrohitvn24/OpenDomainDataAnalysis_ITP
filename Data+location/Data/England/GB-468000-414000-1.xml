   Moorends developed into a pit       
 village when the pit opened in 1911.  
 Today the majority of the people no   
 longer work at the pit which was      
 closed in 1956. The pit was supposed  
 to re-open in 1982, but there have    
 been technical and political setbacks 
 which have kept it closed.            
   The village has four churches:      
 Anglican,R.C.,Jehovahs Witness and    
 Spiritualist.
