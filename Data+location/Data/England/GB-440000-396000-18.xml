		<content>    I was made redundant in 1981 after 
 working at the BSC Aldwarke site for  
 six years. I worked as a Diesel       
 Technician on many forms of commercial
 and plant machinery.                  
    At the time I was working part-time
 in a public house and had the chance  
 of becoming a publican. I decided to  
 take the opportunity while I was still
 young enough to start a new venture so
 my redundancy was 'voluntary'.        
    Redundancy pay was offered but as I
 had decided to leave the industry     
 alternative work did not interest me. 
    Ten of my workmates were made      
 redundant also. I lost touch with most
 of them although I know two of them   
 started their own businesses. As far  
 as I know the others are still unem-  
 ployed.                               
    One month after taking redundancy I
 became a publican.                    </content>
