		<title>01Bewholme and District</title>
		<content> This is an area of mainly mixed arable
 and stock farms, with the sea on the  
 east side.  The low lying cliffs are  
 rapidly being eroded by the action of 
 the sea.  Caravan parks and camping   
 sites are now encroaching on the farm 
 land all down the coast. Bewholme once
 an arriculural village, although it   
 has not increased in size, is now     
 becoming a dormer village for workers 
 in the towns.  It still has a primary 
 school, but older children go the     
 comprehensive school in Hornsea.      
 Atwick village is changing from       
 agricultural to homes for the elderly 
 and retired people mainly from the    
 West Riding of Yorkshire.  The only   
 piece of industry is the caverns being
 gouged out of the rock salt underlying
 this area for the long term storage of
 vast quantities of natural gas.
