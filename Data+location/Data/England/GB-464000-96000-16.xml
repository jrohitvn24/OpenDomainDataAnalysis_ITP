		<title>16CRIME IN SOUTHSEA</title>
		<content>    Most crimes committed in Southsea  
 are related to alcohol or unemploy-   
 ment.The most common are burglary,    
 vandalism and auto-theft.According to 
 local police, about 80% of these      
 crimes are committed by unemployed    
 people.    A lot of crimes have       
 something to do with drugs, such as   
 heroin,LSD,cannabis,cocaine and       
 solvent abuse. If the users are       
 unemployed they obtain money by theft.
 The main area where drugs are, is     
 around Nightingale Road."Stranger     
 danger" is another problem, though    
 offenders are usually local people    
 known to the police.                  
    There are seventy police for the   
 area, though with office work few     
 patrol the beat. Other problems stem  
 from the ports in summer e.g.traffic  
 problems and shoplifting especially   
 by young foreign tourists.            </content>
