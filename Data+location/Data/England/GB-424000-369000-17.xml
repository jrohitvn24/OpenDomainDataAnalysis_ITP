		<title>17Pilsley Well Dressing</title>
		<content> Pilsley village fair and well dressing
 is held in the third week of July.    
                                       
 Prior to this the wooden supporting   
 frame is soaked in water for three    
 weeks. Clay is puddled to a paste, and
 pressed into the frame to form a base 
 for the chosen design or picture. This
 is made by pressing into the clay     
 petals, leaves, seeds etc. From this  
 point the whole thing must be finished
 in three days but thanks to a willing 
 team of local volunteers it is ready  
 and erected on its' site in time.     
                                       
 A second well, dressed by the school  
 children is nearby.                   
                                       
 A thanksgiving service is held in the 
 evening by the Vicar and attracts many
 visitors. The proceeds from the       
 collections help many local charities.</content>
