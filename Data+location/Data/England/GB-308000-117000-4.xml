		<content> The two main forms of transport are   
 the railway and the motorway. We      
 will now tell you some news about the 
 railway .Between 80 to 90 trains pass 
 through the White Ball Tunnel every   
 day.The majority are high speed       
 passenger diesel trains but some are  
 goods and Royal Mail trains.They pass 
 through the tunnel at speeds of       
 between 70 to 80 m.p.h.The railway    
 line runs from Penzance &lt;Cornwall> in 
 the south west to Scotland in the     
 north and also Paddington London in   
 the S.E.It took about a hundred men to
 build the tunnel and it was about 150 
 years ago.  The tunnel is nearly a    
 mile long and it's from a part of     
 Somerset to a part of Devon. You can  
 walk on top of some gorse to see a    
 train go through the tunnel. When it  
 has gone in the tunnel you can't hear 
 it.                                   </content>
