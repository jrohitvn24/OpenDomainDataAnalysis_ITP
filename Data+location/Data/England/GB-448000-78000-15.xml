  Hoy's Monument is a column 72 ft high
 placed on St.Catherines Down.It was   
 erected by Sir Michael Hoy,in memory  
 of Tsar Alexander of Russia's visit to
 the Island in 1816.Later it was used  
 as a memorial to the dead of the      
 Crimean War.                          
  Gotten Manor is one of the last 'one 
 floor' houses left on the Island.This 
 house was probably built near the end 
 of the 13th century.In a document     
 dated 1305,it consisted of a 'hall,a  
 grange,an oxstall,half an acre of     
 garden,a dovecote,30 acres of arable  
 land and 20 acres of pasture.It lies  
 at the foot of St.Catherine's Down.   
 Gotten Manor is now owned,as a private
 house by Mr.and Mrs.Street.Nowadays it
 consists of half an acre of garden,a  
 greenhouse,an old stock yard,and some 
 barns.                                </content>
