The village of Brighurst stands on a   
small knoll in the valley with its     
church tower being visable for quite   
some distance.When you reach the       
village it is quite different.What you 
find is a very small cluster of houses 
set around the church.They are nearly  
all old stone built houses. There are  
no shops or pubs there and both times  
we visited the village we saw no one.  
Life must be very peacefull there.
