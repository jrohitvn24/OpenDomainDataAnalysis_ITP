		<title>13BUTLEIGH SCHOOL - 1845</title>
		<content>    The village school was built in    
 1845 as a National School, and had 150
 children between three and twelve     
 years old, with two teachers and two  
 pupil teachers. The classes were mixed
 but the playground was segregated. The
 curriculum was Maths, Reading and     
 Writing, Needlework for the girls,    
 Military drill for the boys, and      
 Scripture. The Squire often visited   
 the school, and when he entered, this 
 conversation from H.M.S. Pinafore     
 ensued:                               
                                       
{Squire: My gallant crew, good morning.
{School: Sir, good morning.            
{Squire: Hope you are all quite well.  
{School: We're all quite well, hope you
{are as well.                          
 As the Squire checked the register,the
 boys saluted.                         
                                       </content>
