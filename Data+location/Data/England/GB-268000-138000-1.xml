		<title>01Farming Country On Exmoor</title>
		<content> Three quarters of this land lies      
 within Exmoor National Park.  It is   
 dominated by Shoulsbarrow Common, a   
 moorland watershed over 450 meters    
 high. Here is an iron age fort,       
 Shoulsbury Castle, fenced in but not  
 cultivated. Sheep are in evidence     
 everywhere on the grassland, divided  
 into small fields by beech hedges,    
 planted on earth banks a meter high.  
 Steep, narrow, twisting roads lead to 
 isolated farms &amp; one small village. A 
 road, used as a holiday route lies on 
 the Northern boundary. Behind are the 
 high hills of Exmoor which shelter    
 Challacombe, a village by the infant  
 River Bray. An agricultural engineer  
 has a repair business here. A farm now
 offers holiday cottages &amp; campsite.   
 The old school is for sale. No rector 
 lives in the Rectory. It too is sold &amp;
 now receives guests.                  </content>
