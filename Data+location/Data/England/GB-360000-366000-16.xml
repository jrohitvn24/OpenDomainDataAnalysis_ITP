		<content>{THE CLERK TO MARTON PARISH COUNCIL.   
 The present clerk has held the post   
 for just over ten years. He is a      
 retired villager who spends           
 approximately one day per week on     
 council business. Although the post is
 not an honorary one, his salary is    
 little more than pin money.           
   His job includes secretarial and    
 financial duties as well as keeping an
 eye on the village in general.He feels
 that his duties should also include   
 lending a sympathetic ear to all the  
 residents'problems, no matter how     
 small.He welcomes the introduction of 
 a 'question time' session for the     
 general public at the end of each     
 monthly council meeting.              
   The clerk's particular interest is  
 rambling,and as well as taking an     
 active part in the local group he     
 keeps an eye on the footpaths.        </content>
