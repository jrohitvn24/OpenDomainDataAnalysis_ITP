		<title>08WATER TOWER AT TILE HILL</title>
		<content> Tile Hill Water Tower, which stands in
 Cromwell Lane, was built in 1932. It  
 is 24 metres high and holds 13,060    
 cubic metres of water in a single     
 compartment. It is of reinforced      
 concrete and iron, and access to the  
 tank and roof is by a spiral staircase
 in a tube in the centre of the tank.  
 Between the columns are concrete walls
 with windows. The tower serves the    
 local area with water, and is a       
 balancing tank for the Coventry       
 distribution system. This means it    
 holds water above the roofs of the    
 houses so that there is a good 'head' 
 of water flowing in the pipes serving 
 Coventry. The water comes from        
 Strensham Treatment Works near        
 Tewkesbury. Recently the tower has    
 been refurbished. The rust has been   
 scraped away, the concrete made good, 
 and it has been repainted.            </content>
