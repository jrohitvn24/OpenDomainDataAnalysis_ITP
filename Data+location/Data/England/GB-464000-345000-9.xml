		<title>09MY HOBBY IS CRICKET.</title>
		<content>   My hobby is cricket.I am quite good 
 at it and I go to a club every Friday.
 The club is at Caythorpe.Friday is for
 the under 13's and Monday is for the  
 under 15's.                           
   I have just about all the equipment.
 I have 4 bats,3 sets of stumps,5      
 cricket balls,a pair of pads and      
 gloves,2 boxes and all the whites.    
   At school,after dinner,we often have
 a little game on the field at the back
 of the school.I bowl a medium pace    
 with a fairly soft ball and a         
 medium-slow with a cricket ball and I 
 am a fairly low order batsman.I fancy 
 my chances as a bowler rather than a  
 batsman.                              
   In the five matches I have played,we
 have won two and lost 3. Sometimes,at 
 Caythorpe,it is raining so we do      
 nothing.
