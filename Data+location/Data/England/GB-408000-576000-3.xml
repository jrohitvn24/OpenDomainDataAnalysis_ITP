		<content>  3.{The Hall.}This building started in
 the early 1800's was built in the     
 Neo-Classical style using stone from a
 quarry in the grounds. The layout of  
 the interior is simple. The main hall 
 is a copy of the central courtyard of 
 a Greek-Roman house, with the main    
 rooms opening off it.                 
  The grounds of Belsay Hall were      
 well-planned and cared for. Terraces  
 surround the Hall leading down into   
 various gardens, including a Quarry   
 garden, Winter Garden, Magnolia       
 Terrace and Meadow Garden housing a   
 magnificient{"Pocket Handkerchief     
{Tree"}- so-called because of its large
 white bracts.                         
  The restoration of the gardens and   
 buildings is now taking place and it  
 is hoped to rejuvenate the original   
 well-planned landscapes in the next   
 few years.                            </content>
