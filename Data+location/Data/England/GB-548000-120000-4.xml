		<content> Buxted Park House lies to the         
 north_east of Uckfield.Today the      
 mansion is owned by an Arabian prince 
 who rarely visits.It is patrolled by  
 guard dogs.The house and grounds are  
 well maintained by domestic staff and 
 groundsmen who have their own separate
 living quarters beside the mansion.   
   The house itself is surrounded by   
 acres of woodland,pastureland and     
 lakes.Herds of deer roam freely around
 the parkland.                         
   It is perhaps rather unusual that   
 both these Country Houses are still   
 used for private dwelling,rather than 
 being open to the public, as we find  
 in so many other parts of the country.
