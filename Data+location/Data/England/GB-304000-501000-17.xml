		<title>17EVENTS,GOSFORTH IN CUMBRIA.</title>
		<content> Wellington.The village however still  
 looks like a village, the estates     
 being off the main road.              
   {Events.}Although Gosforth is       
 small,there is a strong community     
 spirit. In 1985 it won the Cumbrian   
 award as the best kept large village,a
 joint effort from everyone.           
 The main event of the year is the     
 Gosforth Show. This is a typical      
 Agricultural Show. The morning sees   
 the judging of prize animals, cattle  
 being brought from far afield. Later  
 comes the pony and trap display, the  
 horse jumping and the dog show and the
 Hound trail. There are two giant      
 marquees holding a large selection of 
 garden &amp; craft exhibits. There is, of 
 course, the beer tent, the tea tent   
 and many smaller side stalls.
