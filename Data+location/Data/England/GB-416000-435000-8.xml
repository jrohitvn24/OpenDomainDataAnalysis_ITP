		<content>    James Atkinson Jowett gave Â£100 to 
 some people with which to build a     
 school.It was called{St.James}        
{School}.It was finished in 1859.Before
 St.James Church was built church      
 services were held there .            
    The school has 2 computers.One is a
 BBC model B,the other a Pet           
 computer.We have a Pace disc drive and
 a tape recorder.We have a colour      
 television and a record player with   
 quite a few records.The school has    
 pets- a guinea pig,2 gerbils and some 
 goldfish.At first there were 2        
 halls,outside toilets and caretaker's 
 house.But now there are 4 classes,one 
 in a terrapin,the others in the main  
 building and a television room,       
 library,kitchen and administration.
