 In Wearhead there are 4 shops - a     
 Co-operative Store, a Post Office and 
 General Shop, a butcher and newsagent.
 There is only 1 small General Shop in 
 Ireshopeburn. Mobile Shops visit the  
 area once or twice a week, including 2
 selling groceries and vegetables, a   
 fishmonger who also sells eggs and    
 butter, a butcher and a green grocer. 
 Bread is delivered to local shops from
 bakeries outside the area. Draperies  
 can be bought in St.John's Chapel but 
 most people buy their clothes in      
 neighbouring towns or from mail order 
 catalogues. Hardware is sold at the   
 Co-op. in Wearhead and St.John's      
 Chapel. Farmers' wives may prefer to  
 shop at Hexham when their husbands go 
 to the Mart and those with cars may   
 also shop there or at Stanhope, Crook 
 or Bishop Auckland.                   </content>
