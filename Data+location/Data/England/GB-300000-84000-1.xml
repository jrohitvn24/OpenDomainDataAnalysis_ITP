		<content>  Our area is situated between the city
 of{Exeter}and the seaside town of     
{Exmouth.}The land is basically        
 rural,hilly and primarily used for    
{farming.}However,on the East side of  
 the area there is common land which is
 used by the ECC,for a quarry,and the  
 Royal Marines,for training purposes.  
{The population is small}with the      
 majority centring around{Woodbury.}   
 The area is adequately served by 2 "B"
 roads and several country lanes.      
 The area is not on any major routes.  
 The only{historical remains}in the    
 area are 2 tumuli on the common.      
{Tourism}is catered for with several   
 B&amp;B properties and 2 caravan sites    
 along with car parks on the common.   
{St. Peter's Preparatory School}is     
 sited in our block but serves a much  
 wider area.The School is the largest  
 employer in the area.                 </content>
