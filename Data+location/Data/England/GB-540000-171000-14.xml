   On week days I live with my         
granny.In her garden there are lots of 
trees. Many birds come into the garden 
and sometimes they come up to you. I   
have seen collard doves, wrens, tiny   
birds which are quite rare and hardly  
ever seen, wood pigeons,robins,        
starlings, crows, ravens which,when    
they walk on the roof sound like       
burglars. I have also seen magpies,    
jays, blue tits, great tits and        
finches.I have even seen a linnet.In   
Chislehurst woods you can always spot  
a grey squirrel in any season of the   
year. In Elmstead woods foxes are      
common-they go into peoples  back      
gardens and feed from their dustbins.  
They can become quite tame. Our school 
secretary has a tame fox and she often 
feeds it by hand.
