		<title>12Drinnick Mill Railway Line</title>
		<content> This line was built in 1869/74 to     
 connect the main line at{Burngullow}  
 (St.Mewan) with the{Cornwall Mineral  
{Railway}at St.Dennis Junction. At the 
 time it was known as the{Newquay and  
{Cornwall Junction Railway.}It had been
 intended to run a passenger service to
 Newquay but a difference in gauge was 
 partly responsible for this not coming
 to fruition. There was standard gauge 
 between Drinnick (Nanpean) and Newquay
 but from Drinnick to Burngullow was   
 broad gauge. The line served the clay 
 industry well and continues to operate
 between{Burngullow}and{Parkandillick} 
 although the section beyond this to   
 St.Dennis Junction has been           
 dismantled. At Parkandillick are      
 English China Clays calciners which   
 complete the clay refining process.
