		<content>         In 1946 Canadian Airforce     
 pilot McMullen was returning to RAF   
 Goosepool (now{Teesside Airport)}when 
 his plane caught fire.  He made his   
 crew bale out and steered the doomed  
 plane away from the town.  It crashed 
 near Lingfield Lane which was later   
 renamed {McMullen Road}in his honour. 
                                       
                                       
       In{June 1985}the daughter of the
 pilot came from Canada and unveiled a 
 picture in honour of her father.      
 Formerly, a plaque had been erected   
 near the site of the crash but it had 
 disappeared.  At present the          
 Darlington Council are considering a  
 new plaque but are not sure where to  
 place it.
