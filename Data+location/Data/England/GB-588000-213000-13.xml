		<content> On 30th June Crispin and I sent a     
 letter to the rector. We asked if we  
 could see how many births,deaths and  
 marriages have taken place in 1985. We
 received a reply from the rector      
 saying that on July 3rd after school  
 we could go and look at the church    
 records. When we arrived at the       
 rectory the rector took us to a room  
 where all the church records were     
 kept. First of all we were shown how  
 many deaths had taken place at the    
 church which was seven. They were     
 cremated at Colchester because it was 
 cheaper. Then we looked at how many   
 baptisms that had taken place which   
 was fifteen. Then we looked at how    
 many marriages have taken place which 
 was fifteen. When we had this         
 information we thanked the rector and 
 went home.
