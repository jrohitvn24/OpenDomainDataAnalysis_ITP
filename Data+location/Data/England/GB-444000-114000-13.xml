		<title>13TRADITIONAL HOUSE BUILDING</title>
		<content> In this area there is a rapid         
{population}increase at present.       
 New{housing}is still mostly built in  
 the traditional way although this     
 method is not as cheap in             
 terms of{economics} as building       
 using the newer timber-framed style.  
 First they dig the foundations        
 which the stucture is built on.Then   
 the main inner-wall is built out of   
 breeze-blocks and the outer           
 structure is built around the inner   
 structure.The outer structure is built
 out  of air bricks.There are also     
 metal lintels over each doorway       
 and window in order to hold either    
 the ceiling or roof up.               
 The outer wall has small bits of      
 metal tied into both it and the       
 inner wall in order to create a       
 cavity which is sometimes filled with 
 heat{energy}saving material.          </content>
