		<title>16SHELTERED ACCOMMODATION</title>
		<content> In November,1983, Councillor Davies   
 opened{sheltered accommodation}for    
 people in Hebburn.  There are 27 flats
 with one front door and 4 separate    
 bungalows.  There is an{intercom   }  
 system for safety.  A{warden}lives    
 there too and she helps to organize   
 parties, bingo and other              
 entertainments.  Every room in the    
 building has an{emergency cord}which  
 alerts the warden who can call a      
 doctor.  There are{two lounges}for the
 residents and a{laundry}with washers  
 and dryers.  The residents must be    
 able to look after themselves as it is
 not a nursing home.  Often their      
 families visit and help out.  The     
 corridors have{handrails}on both sides
 to help the shakier walkers;  the     
 oldest resident is 88.  The residents 
 are very happy here but cannot keep   
 pets except for budgies.              </content>
