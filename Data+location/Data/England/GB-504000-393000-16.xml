		<content> The farmers wife of 1985 plays quite a
 different role from that of her pre-  
 decessor in many ways.She no longer   
 has to be up at dawn  black-leading   
 the grate or lighting the copper fire 
 on wash days,but has all the modern   
 electrical equipment as a town house- 
 wife.She must be prepared at times to 
 stop whatever she's doing when help is
 needed on the farm,acting also as sec-
 retary and errand girl.She uses the   
 family car for her weekly trips to the
 supermarket.Bread costs 40-50p.Butter 
 is 50p per 250g and sugar 46p for 1kg.
 She spends much time alone.Her husband
 hasn't a 9 to 5 job,but in summer and 
 particularly at harvest time he works 
 12-14 hours a day,weekends too.In     
 spite of this,it is by far healthier  
 living in the country,away from the   
 fumes  and  pollution of the towns and
 cities.                               </content>
