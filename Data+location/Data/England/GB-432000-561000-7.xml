		<content>{Mrs. Smith}has been employed in her   
 present job for two years, as a       
 secretary in a bank. Mrs. Smith works 
 seven hours a day, five days a week.  
 Her day starts at 9am. and finishes at
 5pm. She has a fifteen minute coffee  
 break at 10am and a lunch break from  
 12am to 1pm.                          
{Mr. Smith}has been unemployed for     
 seven months. His last job, which     
 lasted for only one year, was a       
 community programmer. He earned Â£65   
 per week but now he is only entitled  
 to unemployment benefit of Â£27.25 plus
 family allowance. A typical day in his
 life is a visit to the Job Centre with
 the rest of the day spent doing odd   
 jobs around the house and in the      
 garden. Without Mrs. Smith's income   
 the family would find it very hard to 
 survive.
