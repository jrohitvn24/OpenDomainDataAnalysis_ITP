		<title>20The Bookham Domesday Project</title>
		<content> This part of the project was carried  
 out by a group of WI members from     
 Bookhams Evening, Little Bookham and  
 Eastwick Institutes, following        
 encouragement to take part by the     
 National Federation. They were helped 
 by their families and friends.        
                                       
 The computer was kindly provided by   
 one of their sons, a former pupil of  
 Bookham School and now an Engineer    
 working on the Sussex coast.          
                                       
 The project was an interesting        
 educational experience and all        
 involved enjoyed working on it        
 together.
