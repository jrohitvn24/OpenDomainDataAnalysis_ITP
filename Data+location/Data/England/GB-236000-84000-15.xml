		<title>15FAMILY LIFE continued</title>
		<content> (seventeen acres pasture four         
 acres marsh and woodland)is worked by 
 GN as a dairy unit,two years has been 
 spent building a herd of thirty cows  
 and young stock mainly Jerseys , which
 will hopefully become a viable        
 business. Moving from a highly        
 populated society containing a cross  
 section of nationalities and          
 classes,people seemed to have a       
 broader outlook on life and greater   
 expectatians for themselves and thier 
 children. I find this rural area      
 extremly pleasent as an environment in
 which to live ,far less aggressive.But
 find many of the  inhabitants         
 insular in thier outlook and isolated 
 from the rest of the world.           
 My hopes for the future are for a more
 caring sharing socety, particulry in a
 worldwide context.
