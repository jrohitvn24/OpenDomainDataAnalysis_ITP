		<content> Oakham School was built in 1584 by    
 Archdeacon Johnson.  Oakham School is 
 famous and in 1984 the Queen came to  
 visit Oakham School to celebrate the  
 four hundreth anniversary of its      
 founding.  Oakham School has buildings
 all over the town.  In one part there 
 is the hall, in another there is the  
 sports hall, another the swimming pool
 and so on around the town.  There are 
 about 1000 children at Oakham School. 
 Originally Oakham School only took    
 boys but now girls can go there as    
 well.
