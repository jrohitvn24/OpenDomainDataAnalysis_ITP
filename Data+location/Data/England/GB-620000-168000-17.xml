		<content>     The surrounding countryside has   
not changed a great deal  except that  
many of the field hedges have          
disappeared to make larger fields and  
of course there are many more machines 
used on the fields.One of the farms has
become a farm shop it no longer works  
all its own land.Potatoes are still    
harvested in much the same way with    
 eople coming from outside the area to 
help.The village forge has disappeared 
at is now a house which is up for sale 
it is one of the few thatched houses in
 area.What strikes her most as having  
changed is the housing, which has taken
over much of the open space and quite a
 t of the farmland. She remembers the  
frantic building of the 1960's and     
1970's when many fields and woodland   
was built over.The roads have changed  
little however ,Reculver was a much    
less busy place in her younger days.   </content>
