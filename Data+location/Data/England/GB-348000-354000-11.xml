		<title>11HARTHILL SCHOOL COOKS</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mrs Jones and Mrs      
 Ashley the cooks at Harthill          
 C.P.School. They both thought it took 
 a long time to prepare things like    
 iced cakes. They said they liked their
 own food too! Our cooks enjoy their   
 job so much they would not change. Mrs
 Jones works a 5 hour day, Mrs Ashley  
 works a 2.5 hour day.They prepare 46  
 lunches each day.The food comes from  
 Kitchens Amalgamated Food Ltd. and    
 Morrris and Jones. The menu is planned
 monthly, the leftovers are put in a   
 bin for the pigs at a nearby farm.Mrs 
 Ashley has to wash the floor once a   
 day. When they make a meal they put a 
 sample of it on a plate so that if    
 there is an outbreak of foodpoisoning 
 the Health Inspecter can check it.    
 They call this a Fairy Plate.         
                By Claire and Fiona.
