		<title>04Farming in Rogate</title>
		<content>      Slade farm is bigger than most of
 the farms in the area. It grows wheat,
 barley, kale,grass and turnips        
 together with ten potato fields. The  
 farm produces about 3000 tons of corn 
 a year. The soil is a light brown     
 colour and sandy.                     
    There are no sheep on the land so  
 the farmer has no sheep dog,but he    
 does have 150 milking cows, one bull  
 and 1550 beef cattle. The cows eat    
 kale,hay, straw, silage, rape and     
 dairy nuts.                           
 The milk is collected by a daily      
 tanker. We were very surprised when we
 heard that they used 3000 tons of dung
 on the fields.                        
    The farmer has 15 men helpers and  
 12 ladies some of whom work part time 
 sorting, grading and picking the      
 potatoes.
