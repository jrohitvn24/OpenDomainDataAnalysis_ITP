		<title>09THE MOAT HOUSE GRT.C.</title>
		<content>                                       
Parts of the house are 400 years old.  
The Moat round the house is mentioned  
in the ancient Domesday Book. There are
4 protected trees in the house grounds.
One of the trees is called Wellingtonia
it is over 160 years old. The          
Wellingtonia is planted to remember the
Duke of Wellington. The Oregon Pine is 
one hundred and fifty years old. The   
Turkey oak is one hundred and forty    
years old, the  other protected        
tree we think is a Walnut tree.        
The Turkey Oak's trunk measured three  
metres eighty-two cm. The              
Wellingtonia's trunk measured four     
metres thirty cm. The Walnut tree's    
trunk measured two metres sixty-three  
cm.
