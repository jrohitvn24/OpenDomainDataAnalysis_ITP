		<title>08WESTBURY SWIMMING POOL</title>
		<content>   Westbury Swimming Pool was built by 
 Mr.W.H.Laverton, a local wool trader. 
 The foundation stone was laid by his  
 wife in 1887 and as such was one of   
 the earliest indoor swimming baths in 
 the country.  The pool was filled     
 directly from spring water and changed
 once a week, however it proved too    
 expensive for Mr.Laverton to maintain 
 and it was taken over by the Urban    
 Council and opened to the public in   
 1900.  The beautifully restored cast  
 iron roof joists each carry a coat of 
 arms either of the Laverton shield or 
 the Westbury Council shield.          
   In September 1983 a programme of    
 extensive repairs and improvements was
 carried out. Many features of the old 
 building were restored and new        
 equipment and facilities provided     
 costing Â£306,000. Reopened January    
 1985,approx.1500 bathers use it weekly</content>
