		<content> The land coverage is mainly rural     
 with woodland both coniferous and     
 deciduous trees,heathland with gorse  
 and bracken. It is famous for the     
 nightingales which nest there.        
 Much of the land is farmland mainly   
 pasture for sheep and cattle. The     
 secondary land cover is residential   
 which covers the whole village. In    
 Chudleigh Knighton we have got private
 houses,council houses and a           
 residential caravan park. The River   
 Teign flows through the village from  
 Dartmoor. It enters the sea at        
 Teignmouth. The main A38 dual_carriage
 way skirts the village.This has       
 replaced the old A38 coach road.      
 Ugbrooke House is a historic building 
 home of Lord and Lady Clifford. It is 
 situated amid woodland and parkland   
 to the north of the village.W.B.B.    
 clay works are the main industry.     </content>
