		<title>05WINTERTON SHOW</title>
		<content> The Winterton show is an annual event 
 which began in 1872. The show began   
 when farming people started to breed  
 cattle and wanted to see who had the  
 best. It really began just as         
 competing but years from then it has  
 turned into a family outing with      
 fairs, side stalls etc. Farmers still 
 bring their cattle to compete although
 not as many. Pigs and cows are banned 
 in case of any disease. The horse     
 jumping soon started in 1874 but in   
 those days it was called leaping      
 horses. The winner would get Â£5 which 
 was a lot of money then. In 1926 horse
 jumping was introduced world wide by  
 the British Horse Jumping Association.
 They used to put special trains on.   
 They used to get off at Appleby and   
 walk to Winterton which is about 4    
 miles.
