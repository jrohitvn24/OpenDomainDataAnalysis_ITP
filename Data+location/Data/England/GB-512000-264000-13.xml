		<title>13         CLUBS</title>
		<content>    The village of Gt. Staughton is    
 rich in its Club activities. All      
 residents are automatically members   
 of the Community Association which    
 organises many social, cultural and   
 sporting events.                      
    There is a thriving Drama Club -   
 Staughton Stagers - and a Youth Club  
 for our young people of 10+.  For the 
 adults we have a Social Club, Women's 
 Institute, Mothers' Union, British    
 Legion, an Over 60's Club and a       
 Horticultural Society.                
    The village school is host to the  
 Brownie Pack and the Guide Company.   
 Playgroup and Play &amp; Chat Club ensure 
 that our Under 5's are not forgotten. 
    We have a Tennis Club with its     
 own new court on the Playing Field;   
 Football, Cricket, Badminton and      
 Table Tennis Clubs also meet in the   
 appropriate  seasons.                 </content>
