		<title>20COOPERS GREEN POND</title>
		<content>Coopers Green Pond is in grid square   
7850 and is used by the cows grazing on
Brassingtons Farm.It used to be an old 
marl pit when clay was dug out for the 
pottery industry.It is at least 50     
years old.It is 30 paces wide and 31   
paces long and is fed by an underground
spring in the middle of the pond and it
has never dried up even in very dry    
weather.                               
It is not known how deep the pond is   
exactly and local people argue as to   
how deep it really is.However it is    
known that two people have commited    
suicide in it in the past - one a local
painter and the other a Mrs Johnson.   
Some people say it may be haunted but  
Mr Nield and Mr Holdway who live nearby
say that it is only the cows and some  
wild foxes who use the pond today.
