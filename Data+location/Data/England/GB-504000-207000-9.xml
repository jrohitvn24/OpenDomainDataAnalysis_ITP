		<title>09PLAYGROUND GAMES (2) HEMEL</title>
		<content>   These games are popular at Barncroft
 JMI School.                           
{"Pegit"}in which the game is a chase  
 and catch around a circle. The        
 children run and a "catcher" follows. 
 When runners are caught, they also    
 become "catchers". The winner is the  
 last runner to be caught.             
{"Gregory Green"}in which one team     
 "runs" and the other "catches". The   
 "catchers" count to 100 before they   
 chase the "runners". When a person is 
 "caught", he stands still, and is     
 "freed" by another team member hitting
 his hand. The game is over when all   
 "runners" are caught.                 
{"Tin,Tan,Tommy"}in which one person is
 the "catcher". He counts to 100 while 
 the rest of the players hide. When he 
 finds them he says, "Tin,Tam,Tommy - I
 see (Name of player)", and he touches 
 home base.                            </content>
