		<title>03SEA DEFENCE AT PETT LEVEL</title>
		<content> The Southern Water Authority works    
 constantly to prevent lowland{flooding
 at Pett Level.  The beach is made up  
 of rounded flint pebbles which are    
 moved by the littoral drift, west to  
 east, from Pett Level to Rye Harbour  
 entrance.  Lorries ply constantly from
 Rye to Pett Level bringing back loads 
 of beach, 20000 cubic metres every    
 year.  In 1932, after a court action  
 was brought to prevent a private      
 citizen fencing off the beach, right  
 of way was established and in 1934 a  
 wooden{sea wall}and slipway were      
 built.  In the autumn of 1984 heavy   
 seas flooded a caravan site behind the
 wall.  Now, new defences are being    
 built. A wall of interlocking concrete
 blocks with steel sheet piling is     
 partly finished, above it will be a   
 curved{wave wall,}a road and a second 
 wall.  The cost will be about Â£400,000</content>
