		<content>    Although{Towcester}is not very     
 large, it has it's own{Magistrates'   
{Court.}In the Towcester Magistrates'  
 Court there is a bench where a group  
 of Magistrates sit - they are called  
{the bench.}In front of that there is  
 the{clerk's desk.}He asks the         
 Magistrates for their opinion on the  
 case. The Magistrates have no real    
 knowledge of the law, they just decide
 whether a person is{'guilty' or 'not  
{guilty'}- which is why the clerk is   
 there. The clerk knows a lot about the
 law, so he{gathers information}from   
 the witness and the accused. Then he  
 asks the Magistrates' whether the     
 accused is guilty or not.             
    To the right of the clerk are the  
{press.}In front of the clerk are two  
 people, who both help. One person will
 speak against the accused and the     
 other will say things for the accused.</content>
