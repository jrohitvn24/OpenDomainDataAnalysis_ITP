		<title>14RECREATION IN SOUTH LINCS</title>
		<content>   Recreational facilities are limited 
 to mainly outdoor pursuits. Nature    
 trails can be enjoyed in the woodlands
 and across some farmland. There are a 
 few remaining rights of way for       
 walking.                              
   One of the farms operates a riding  
 school providing facilities for riding
 holidays, as well as catering for     
 local individuals. One afternoon a    
 week mentally handicapped patients    
 from St. Peter's Hospital, Bourne are 
 able to ride there.                   
   The owner of the riding school      
 breeds ponies, race horses and        
 hunters. At present he has fifty      
 horses in his stables.
