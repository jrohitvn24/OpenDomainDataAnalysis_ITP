		<content> My Dad's factory makes tools for other
 factories, like the helicopter        
 factory. It also makes other metal    
 things like buckles for the shoe      
 factory. They have a lot of machines  
 and nearly every year they buy a new  
 machine. It is a very good factory and
 it was built in 1963. There is a new  
 computer to help in the work. They get
 a lot of jobs in, some big jobs and   
 some small. Sometimes it is hard to   
 get to the end of the factory because 
 it is so crowded. The factory people  
 work from 8 o'clock in the morning to 
 5 o'clock when we have our tea. There 
 is always a lot of mess and a man     
 comes to sweep up in the mornings.    
 Mostly Grandad does the deliveries,   
 but sometimes my Mum or my Nan help.
