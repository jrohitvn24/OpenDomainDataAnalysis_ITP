		<title>10Housing in Hittesleigh</title>
		<content> The variety in the housing found      
 reflects not only the history of the  
 area but also the character of the    
 present population. Houses are fairly 
 evenly distributed over the area with 
 the exception of the wooded Yeo       
 valley, where the absence of new      
 housing is particularly noticeable. By
 far the greatest proportion consists  
 of farmhouses and cottages dating from
 the 13th century and later.           
 Constructed mainly of cob, most remain
 thatched: a few, such as Medlake      
 farmhouse, have been little           
 modernised; others rebuilt in part or 
 entirely, largely owing to fires in   
 the thatch.
