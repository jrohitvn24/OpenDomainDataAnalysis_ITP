		<content>   The home life of the residents of   
 Cock Clarks and Purleigh varies       
 depending on the age group, the sex   
 and whether or not they've got        
 children.There are not many young     
 adults in the area compared with the  
 elderly and the middle aged.          
   The people with children tended to  
 say that there was not enough going on
 for youngsters such as playing fields 
 and youth clubs.However, the people   
 without children thought more about   
 the pavements, the bus services and   
 the roads.                            
   Most people had solid fuel          
 heating.Out of the seven people we    
 interviewed, the women did the cooking
 and shared the gardening with their   
 husbands.                             
   Everyone had at least one pet and   
 owned a car.Everyone shopped at either
 Maldon or South Woodham Ferrers.      </content>
