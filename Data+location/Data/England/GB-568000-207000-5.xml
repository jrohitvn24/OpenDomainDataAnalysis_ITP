		<title>05New Estate in Chelmsford (2)</title>
		<content>   The{shopping facilities}are         
 generally{not very good}although there
 is a large supermarket.Many           
 people,especially the{elderly}at      
 Newlands Spring would like to have a  
{post office}nearby.This is probably so
 that they would be able to get their  
 pensions more easily.Some of them felt
 that a small food store would save    
 them queueing up in the supermarket   
 for just a couple of items.{A fish and
{chip shop would also be popular with  
{all age groups.}Generally, our group  
 thinks that Newlands Spring estate is 
 good but it does not have very many   
 facilities to offer the older         
 generation. This may be because the   
{estate}was probably{built for young   
{families with children.
