		<title>08A Patient In Hospital.</title>
		<content> In April, 1984 my doctor made me an   
 appointment to go into hospital. I had
 to have an operation on my ear to put 
 a grommet in. Near where I slept there
 was an inside play area with a        
 climbing frame, a slide, two gymnasium
 bars, a grand piano and a television  
 room. Before I had my operation I had 
 to get changed into a white gown. I   
 was given a pink tablet in a glass of 
 water - soon, I fell asleep. When I   
 woke up I felt hungry, a nurse came in
 and asked me if I wanted some Rice    
 Krispies. Half way through eating them
 my mum came . When I had finished my  
 mum went home. Later on I felt sick.  
 Some nurses asked what was wrong, then
 I was sick. The day after my operation
 I went home.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
