		<title>02OLD HOUSES IN DUNSFORD</title>
		<content> Dunsford has many old houses making   
 up the backbone of the village.Most of
 them are made of cob and thatch,though
 some of the old thatch roofs have been
 converted to slate.In Reedy, a small  
 suburb of Dunsford there are several  
 old houses.One of which,called Reedy  
 Corner Cottage,is 400hundred years old
 It was once a barn belonging to a     
 nearby house.It was changed into a    
 house with a thatched roof and        
 eventully to it's present state with a
 slate roof.Further on is another old  
 thatched house which has recently been
 re-thatched.In the main village there 
 are many old houses.One of them,      
 situtated off the main road was       
 mentioned in the origional Domesday   
 book.It has been repaired many times  
 since then.
