		<title>19NUNTHORPE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This school has nursery children aged 
 3. The school is well equipped with   
 computers, calculators, television,   
 video and library but we need new     
 desks. We have a self-service dinner  
 system. Favourite lessons are Art,    
 Games Science and Educational outings.
 We have had Christmas Carol Concerts, 
 Dramatic productions, Easter Bonnet   
 and Egg Decorating Competitions,      
 football matches and an Asian week. We
 made sweets to sell at our Summer     
 Carnival which had games like tombola 
 and wet sponge throwing,              
 'body-popping' display and pony rides.
 We also have Sports Day and a party   
 for the J4 school leavers. Our        
 groundsmen work at 8 schools in a     
 week. They cut grass, mark tracks,    
 weed and trim hedges. One is 1.98m    
 tall. We call him the 'Jolly Green    
 Giant'.                               </content>
