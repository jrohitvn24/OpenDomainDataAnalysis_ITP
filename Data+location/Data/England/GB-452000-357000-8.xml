		<content> A survey of children at Berry Hill    
 Middle School showed that the most    
 common method of communication was by 
 radio,69% people questioned owned     
 one.The television came next with 60%.
      That surprised us very much      
 because we thought the phone would    
 have been the most important but only 
 57% had one.37% of those questioned   
 didn't write letters at all,but only  
 7% wrote a letter more than 6 times a 
 month,probably because we now use the 
 phone more often.                     
 British Telecom is the biggest        
 telephone company in Britain.It sells 
 a large number of phones and connects 
 people to the phone system.
