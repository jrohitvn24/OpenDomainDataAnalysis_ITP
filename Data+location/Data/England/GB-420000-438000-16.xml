		<title>16Business in Rawdon</title>
		<content>  These range from a company with 350  
 employees making ventilation systems  
 and a family-owned printing firm(est. 
 1904)with 165 making cardboard        
 cartons,through many craft workshops, 
 to self-employed people working from  
 home.{Industrial development}is       
 restricted in this green belt area,so 
 most are housed in converted premises 
 which were originally woollen mills,a 
 chemical works,and a Quaker school.   
  People regard it as a good place for 
 a business,being {pleasantly rural}yet
 near the{airport,main roads}and{major 
{industrial centres}of Bradford and    
 Leeds.Small businesses rent rooms in  
 old buildings cheaply and near their  
 homes.The largest firm bought an old  
 mill 10 years ago and recently        
 demolished it and erected an extensive
 new factory on the site which was     
 opened by the Duchess of Kent in 1985.</content>
