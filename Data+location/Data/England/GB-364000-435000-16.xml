		<title>16River Ribble in Ribchester</title>
		<content>The Ribble is used for fishing,canoei- 
ng and swimming.The river has changed  
course; it meanders about quite a lot. 
Since it has changed course it has     
covered up part of the Roman fort. In  
1980 there was a big flood, the river  
burst its banks covering fields and    
most of the village. The water rose to 
within six feet of the school wall. It 
flooded some people's houses. The sand 
martins nest along the river bank.     
There is only one crossing in our block
and that is the De Tabley bridge; once 
people had to go to Clitheroe to cross.
When people come and swim they bring   
dingies and go down the rapids. Quite a
lot of Roman remains have been found in
or near the river: a helmet, which is  
now in the British museum, and the     
pillars of the White Bull Inn. A lot of
fishermen come and fish here.
