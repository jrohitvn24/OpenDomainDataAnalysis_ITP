		<content>{  Wymondham}is a friendly, active     
 town, with a fascinating historical   
 background. Today it has a well       
 established commercial life, thriving 
 industrial estates and well over a    
 hundred active social organisations,  
 many with international connections.  
   The seat of Kett's Rebellion in 1549
 it takes a pride in being a self      
 contained community and is keen to    
 conserve its independence, especially 
 as its population increases from a    
 present 10,000 to 14,000 in 10 years  
 time. The town still retains much     
 of its historic character including a 
 market function for the surrounding   
 villages and provides a venue for     
 traditional fairs and carnivals.      
    There are road,bus and rail links  
 to Norwich Cambridge and London,two   
 hotels and a number of historic inns.
