		<content> Most houses are fairly well maintained
 except for council houses. Many       
 properties were built about 50 years  
 ago, although there are a few modern  
 properties. A household consists of 3 
 bedrooms in the house or maybe more   
 and also a telephone. Not many people 
 are without telephones. Most people   
 use their own car and only a few use  
 public transport. The main religion is
 Church of England and a few had no    
 religion at all. A majority of people 
 work. Not many people have made       
 additions to their houses as yet.
