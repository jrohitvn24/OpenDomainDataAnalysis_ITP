		<title>05Farming Changes</title>
		<content> It is easier to farm now than years   
 ago because of machinery,chemicals and
 better seeds.Greenlands farm had lots 
 of animals such as dairy cattle, beef 
 cattle, pigs and sheep which used to  
 take a lot of looking after. Nowadays 
 there is only a herd of Lincoln Red   
 cattle to be reared for market.The    
 farming is mostly arable.The farmer   
 manages over 500 acres of land with   
 only 4 workers and various machines.  
 He has 4 tractors and a combine       
 harvester.He uses fertilisers and     
 sprays against insects and diseases as
 well as better seeds which all help   
 give a bigger crop. Farming today is a
 very costly business and he needs to  
 make Â£200 an acre to break even.Some  
 things dont change such as the pattern
 of rotation the cycle of ploughing,   
 sowing and reaping and of course he   
 still depends a lot on the weather.   </content>
