		<content> There are no large departmental       
 stores, only small shops, but they    
 mostly provide the locals with their  
 every day requirements. A large number
 of gift shops cater for the tourists  
 as do the numerous cafes and          
 restaurants some of which are open all
 the year round. A tourist information 
 bureau is situated on the lawn which  
 provides tourists with information    
 about the area. During the summer     
 there are often market type sales on  
 the lawn along with various fayres    
 held by local organisations. The banks
 are well represented and there is a   
 modern Post Office.
