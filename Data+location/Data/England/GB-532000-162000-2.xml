		<title>02HOUSES IN S.CROYDON</title>
		<content> My house is on the Brighton Rd.My     
 house was built in 1883.It is a       
 Victorian house.Since moving into our 
 house we have put in new windows,a new
 front door and tiled the roof.At the  
 back of my garden there is an         
 alleyway.It used to be a railway line 
 but you cannot see the rails.We have  
 got used to the traffic noises.The    
 garden is quite big and has a         
 lawn,shed and fruit trees.            
 Valerie's house is large and detached 
 with a green slate roof.It has windows
 of wood and aluminium and a glass     
 front door.It has a big garden with   
 flower beds,trees and a fish          
 pond.There is a big lawn,a shed and a 
 greenhouse.The house is on Pampisford 
 Rd.,up the hill from Brighton Rd.
