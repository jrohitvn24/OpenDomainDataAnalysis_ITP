		<title>11ANCIENT HOUSES</title>
		<content> There are two ancient houses in the   
 Three Mosses area.  Both are privately
 owned.                                
 1. Stocks Cottage in Haskayne village 
 is reputedly the oldest house in the  
 West Lancs. district. Dating back to  
 approx. 12th Century, and             
 exceptionally good example of the     
 Crook Beam structure. The cottage was 
 extensively renovated several years   
 ago.                                  
 2. Leigh's Cottages in Station Road,  
 Barton dates back to the early 18th   
 Century. Built on stable ground, the  
 rounded tower frontage with window was
 reputedly used as a guide for ships   
 when a light was placed there. The    
 house was dedicated to the Rev. Canon 
 Leigh who rode on horseback to        
 Walton-on-the-Hill to give the        
 services. The house is privately      
 owned.                                </content>
