		<content>    At the turn of the Nineteenth      
 Century Reading Street was a very busy
 fishing village. There are houses     
 built in local flint e.g. The White   
 Swan dating from 1704. There are a    
 pair of brick houses with the stepped 
 and rounded gables commonly described 
 as Flemish. They were probably built  
 by a group of refugees from France.   
    Lord Northcliffe, first of the     
 press barons, lived locally and just  
 around the corner is The Thatched     
 House, the first home to win the      
 'Ideal Homes' competition, in the     
 1930's.                               
    Each Harvest Sunday the local      
 church congregation parades through   
 the village for the blessing of the   
 crops at Elmwood Farm. Here the       
 donkeys that walk Broadstairs beach   
 are kept, amongst the fields of       
 potatoes and califlowers.             </content>
