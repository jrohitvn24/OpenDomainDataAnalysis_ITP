		<title>12THE WOODYARD</title>
		<content> The woodyard in Church Lane has been  
 running as a family firm for 70 years.
 Five men work there .They obtain trees
 from {Longleat,}parks in Bath or other
 woods. The trees used are Beech, Ash, 
 Pine,Elm and Oak. Soft wood is used   
 for fencing and housing etc.. The hard
 woods go for{pit props, rail supports 
{and building.}Coal comes from         
 Nottingham and the same lorry takes   
 the props back - about 32 tons of wood
 per month. Anthracite comes from South
 Wales. Any wood which cannot be used  
 or sold is cut up for firewood. There 
 is a huge bandsaw powered by a diesel 
 engine. The blade is 27 feet long. A  
 slow moving table pushes the trees to 
 the blade. Each blade only lasts a day
 then it has to be sent away for       
 sharpening.
