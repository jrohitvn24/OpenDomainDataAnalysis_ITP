		<title>15A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A MUM</title>
		<content> My mother is woken by her alarm at    
 5.59a.m. to start another busy day.   
 She takes her daughter, Vicki, to a   
 training session at the swimming pool 
 from 6.30 to 7.30, then she cooks     
 breakfast for her family and does some
 chores. She goes to work at 9.00      
 having dropped Vicki at school. As an 
 assistant at Southgate West School she
 rushes from one job to another record-
 ing videos, counting money, typing    
 letters, giving first aid, setting up 
 science lessons. She rushes home for a
 sandwich between 12 and 12.30. Work   
 over at 3.30 she collects Vicki to go 
 for a piano lesson at 4.30 then home  
 for a snack before Vicki goes to      
 orchestra practice. Mum can then relax
 with her husband. She then tidies up  
 the house, washes up perhaps, and     
 makes her way to bed at about 10.30,  
 to read for a while.                  </content>
