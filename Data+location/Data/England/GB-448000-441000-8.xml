		<title>08BREWERIES OF TADCASTER</title>
		<content>   Brewing has been going on in        
 Tadcaster since the 13th century.     
 Records show that there were at least 
 2 brew houses then,both paying        
 taxes.It was mainly due to the water  
 in Tadcaster.The rock was limestone   
 which made the water hard.When the    
 railways arrived,and coaches were not 
 used very often,Tadcaster was a dying 
 town.But the breweries developed and  
 saved the town.The history of John    
 Smith Tadcaster Brewery dates back to 
 1758 to a small,some what rundown     
 brewery at one time owned by          
 postmaster John Hartley inn owner     
 David Blackhouse.                     
   The breweries are the towns largest 
 industry; and now there are three     
 breweries John Smith's; Bass          
 Charringtons and Samuel Smith's old   
 brewery which makes Tadcaster the     
 third main brewing town in the country</content>
