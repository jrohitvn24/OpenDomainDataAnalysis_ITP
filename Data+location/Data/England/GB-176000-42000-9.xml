		<title>09Farm Visits.</title>
		<content> Our project study area mainly contains
 Farmland but we do have some of{      
{Threemilestone}on our grid reference. 
 We paid several visits to farms. Both 
 Dairy and Farms that keep livestock.  
 But we also went to Agricultural      
 Merchants e.g. Cornwall Farmers at    
 Truro Station. They sell animal food  
 for a variety of animals. They also   
 stock Fertilizers. Fertilizers are    
 special chemicals to improve growing  
 e.g. Flowers,grass and vegetables.    
 There is one more Cornwall Farmers    
 which sells pesticides which help to  
 kill off or control bugs that do      
 damage to crops. They also sell       
 generators plus metal poles to tie    
 electric wire to. We went to{Killiow  
{Country Park.}They showed us cows,    
 chickens and lots more livestock. They
 showed us the old farming equipment   
 used long ago.                        </content>
