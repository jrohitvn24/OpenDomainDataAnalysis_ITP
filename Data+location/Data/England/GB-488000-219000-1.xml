		<title>01Mentmore and its  Environs</title>
		<content> Our area's main village{Mentmore}is   
 dominated by the stately home,        
{Mentmore Towers,}but it also includes 
 the tiny hamlet of{Crafton}and part of
{Ledburn}village. The countryside is   
 undulating and lies within the        
 northern reaches of the{Aylesbury     
{Vale.}There are several farms in the  
 area and the land is largely arable,  
 with a little pasture but a lot of the
 inhabitants are commuters, using the  
 main line to Euston from nearby       
 Leighton Buzzard or Cheddington       
 stations. To a casual onlooker from   
 one of the few roads which cross it,  
 the land would probably seem flat and 
 boring but this is far from the case. 
 There is considerable natural         
 wildlife, and the human residents make
 use of their surroundings in ways that
 are often unusual and interesting, as 
 well as the more traditional.         </content>
