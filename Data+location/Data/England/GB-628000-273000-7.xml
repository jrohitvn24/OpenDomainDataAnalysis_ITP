		<content> Farmers and landowners cover the whole
 spectrum of conservation conciousness.
 At the top end we have the owner of   
 Linstead farm who uses modern         
 machinery and technology while        
 conserving and developing the         
 countrysides's natural features. Trees
 and hedges have been retained and     
 planted, ponds created and areas left 
 uncultivated to maintain an ecological
 balance.At the other end we have      
 "prairie" type farming. Hedges and    
 trees have been uprooted and ditches  
                                       
 filled in,with apparent disregard for 
 anything but recouping the high       
 purchase price of the land.A recent   
 project is the creation of an         
 organically farmed market garden,     
 whose owner is producing vegetables   
 without the aid of artificial         
 fertiliserd or sprays.                </content>
