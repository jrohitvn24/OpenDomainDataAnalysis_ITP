		<content> The area is essentially one of rolling
 farmland and forestry commission      
 plantations on the remains of the     
 fourth Earl of Portsmouths estate     
 whose county seat (now a ruin)        
 is to be found.                       
 In Heywood Wood is to be found a motte
 and bailey thought to be an Iron Age  
 fortificaiton with Norman Additions.  
 The local farms are all connected with
 the Portsmouth Estate broken up in    
 circa 1913 and are of Yeomen type in  
 terms of their inhabitants            
 Visitors to the Wembworthy Centre     
 (mainly from Devon) make full         
 use of the local resources in the form
 of woodland and village trails,       
 woods and lanes for navigational      
 exercises and visit the settlement of 
 Bridge Rowe where the former          
 blacksmiths forge is now a craft      
 centre                                </content>
