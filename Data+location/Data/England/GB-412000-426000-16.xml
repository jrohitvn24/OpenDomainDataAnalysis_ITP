		<title>16GHOSTS AND TALES OF WYKE 1.</title>
		<content>   There are many ghosts and tales that
 Wyke people tell.  The most well known
 ghost is the headless horseman who    
 rides around Judy Woods at night.  The
 man had committed suicide in High     
 Fernley House because the girl he     
 loved had married his brother.        
   High Fernley House was built in 1696
 for William and Mary Richardson of    
 Bierley Hall, whose initials W.R.M.   
 can be found about the front door     
 together with a sundial.  The house is
 noted for its fine mullioned windows. 
   Close by in High Fernley Farm,      
 parchments containing a gypsy's curse 
 were found in the beams of a barn.  If
 they are removed, bad luck and        
 misfortune is said to fall on the     
 owners.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
