		<content> At 11.00 I get woken up by my mum I   
 had a cereal called "Start",I read a  
 comic called "Buster"and ask my mum if
 I can go down to the leisure centre in
 Newbury,with Craig.I get changed and  
 dive into the pool I race Craig and   
 duck him, I come out after an hour and
 go to the canteen for a snack (sweets)
 and my mum drives me home.I put my    
 swimming trunks in the washing        
 machine, and put my towel on the line 
 to dry,and go out to play with Craig. 
 We go over the building site where the
 jumps are.After a while I come in(at  
 5.30)then have a shower followed by   
 supper which is salad.I watch "Knight 
 Rider"on television and "The Kenny    
 Everet Show."Afterwards I change into 
 my American football pyjamas,wash then
 go to bed.
