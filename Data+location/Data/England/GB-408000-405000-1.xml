		<title>01Landscape Moorland Soils</title>
		<content> High millstone grit moorlands with    
 thick deposits of peat make up the    
 western area of this block. The land  
 here rises to over 500m and the       
 highest point on the S.W. corner is   
 over 570m and close to the summit of  
 Black Hill just outside the area. The 
 land here is unenclosed and is covered
 by Sheeps Fescule, Cotton grass and   
 other moorland vegetation. Some sheep 
 are moved on to this higher land in   
 the summer and commercial shooting    
 interests also operate here. Many     
 small streams drain off the           
 plateau-like upland and flow into the 
 reservoir complex in the lower eastern
 half off the area. The land surface   
 falls steeply, with small fields      
 seperated by dry stone walls to the   
 lowest land at 180m above sea level.
