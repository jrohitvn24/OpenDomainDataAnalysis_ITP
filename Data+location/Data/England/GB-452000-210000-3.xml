		<content>  The Pilgrim Trust and the Oxford     
 Preservation Trust have protected the 
 views over Otmoor from the village of 
 Elsfield.In Woodeaton the O.P.T. have 
 built 13 houses in keeping with their 
 surroundings. Woodeaton was a         
 recognised community in Anglo-Saxon   
 times.The present manor house, now a  
 special school,dates from 1770.       
  Bridleways (signed) exist between    
 Woodeaton and Elsfield and there is   
 one between Prattle Wood and Noke.    
 These are deeply rutted and muddy to  
 walk along in bad weather. Footpaths  
 run by woods, cornfields, over meadows
 and by the river. These are sometimes 
 overgrown and difficult to follow.    
 Bridges over streams are intact. The  
 Oxfordshire Way, running from Islip to
 Noke, and the footpaths are well      
 signed.
