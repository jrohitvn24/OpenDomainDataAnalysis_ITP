		<content>  The three areas of wasteland from    
 which soil samples were taken all     
 showed{clay}to be the chief           
 constituent. The disused pit which had
 been filled in was mainly{sand.}These 
 areas were all covered with grasses   
 and flowers of the{pea}family such as 
{tufted vetch}and{clovers.}An area of  
 the recreation ground which had been  
 recently disturbed contained more sand
 and there were few grasses here, but a
 large variety of wild flowers, none of
 which were well established.          
  Cultivated areas had soil of which   
 clay was the chief constituent, but   
 gardens which had been treated with   
 compost or had a large number of trees
 contained more{humus.}Most gardens had
 over half the area grassed, about a   
 quarter with flowers and the rest as  
 vegetables, trees or shrubs.
