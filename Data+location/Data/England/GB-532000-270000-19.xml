		<title>19A Young Man of Needingworth.</title>
		<content> Robin is 21 years old, single, and was
 born, and has lived, in Needing worth 
 all his life. He likes living here    
 because he thinks most people are     
 friendly. He lives with his family.   
 His elder brother lives in Brighton.  
 (His brother worked as a chef in a    
 local inn, but moved because he was   
 offered a flat and a job in Brighton.)
   Robin has a darkroom in his bedroom 
 and develops his own films in his     
 spare time. He thinks there are not   
 enough facillities for young people   
 but there are enough sports. He would 
 like to see a youth club and a disco  
 once a month. The biggest changes in  
 his life were,learning to drive,going 
 to and leaving secondary school.He    
 owns a car and likes to get away from 
 things occasionally.He works at the   
 local butcher's shop,he finds the work
 boring at times.                      </content>
