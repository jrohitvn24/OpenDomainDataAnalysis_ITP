		<title>19Morganite Crucible, Norton</title>
		<content>   The impressive industrial chimney of
 this secluded and rather oddly placed 
 factory is visible for miles around   
 this rough grassland area in The      
 Midlands. Morganite is on a back road 
 near Littleworth. Compared with other 
 factories built in the 1930's, the    
 mere 450 employees is small. During   
 the war years, crucible factories were
 of vital importance to the war effort.
 Since then, the demand for crucibles  
 has declined.                         
   Originally, the site on which       
 Morganite Crucible now manufactures   
 crucibles for all Europe, housed a jam
 factory. Selbeys jam factory          
 encouraged local people to grow       
 damsons for their jam. Today, there is
 a reminder of the old jam factory     
 because damsons still grow profusely.
