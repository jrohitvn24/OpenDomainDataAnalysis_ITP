		<content> This village in the Coln Valley       
 consists of stone-built houses most of
 which are old. There are two farms,   
 and some of the houses are used for   
 agricultural workers, the rest mainly 
 for retired people or as second homes.
 The church of St. Andrew is ancient,  
 of Saxon origin, with later Norman    
 work aqnd is comparatively unspoilt.  
 Services take place every other       
 Sunday. Behind the church lies the    
 "Old Priest's House", an ancient      
 ecclesiastical building now somewhat  
 derelict. The former vicarage  is now 
 in private ownership. The village has 
 no post office, shop or any other     
 amenity, except for a Village Hall    
 which is used for functions such as   
 Women's Institute meetings, sales,    
 fairs, receptions etc. However, a     
 mobile library calls.
