		<content> Immediately to the south of the       
 limestone quarry is Creswell Crags, a 
 limestone gorge with a pond and a     
 stream running through it. There are  
 lots of caves in the limestone cliffs.
 Robin Hood's Cave is the largest one  
 and the other main caves are Pin Hole 
 Cave, Church Hole Cave, Boat House    
 Cave and Mother Grundy's Parlour.     
 Stone Age Man lived in these caves    
 thousands of years ago and their tools
 and implements have been found here.  
 The bones of bison, woolly rhinoceros,
 horses, hyenas and bears have also    
 been found in the caves.              
 Creswellian Man did not paint on the  
 walls of their caves but made carvings
 on animal bones instead. There is a   
 good exhibition of all these          
 historical finds in the Crags Visitor 
 Centre.
