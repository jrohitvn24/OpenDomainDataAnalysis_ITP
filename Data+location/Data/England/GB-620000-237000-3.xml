		<title>03PIN MILL</title>
		<content>  Pin Mill is a small village situated 
in a bay of the River Orwell which     
provides shelter for yachts and barges.
Its quiet and beauty has attracted     
artists and authors. Arthur Ransome    
and Arnot Robinson featured Pin Mill in
their books. The house where Ransome   
wrote his children's books is still    
rented by holiday-makers. Edward Seago 
painted here and a mural by Z. Blakely 
of Sailing Barges is in the Pin Mill   
Sailing Club. Some cottages are near   
the Grindle which flows into the River 
Orwell,the rest are along the road to  
Chelmondiston. Most of the inhabitants 
are commuters or retired. Today Pin    
Mill is a sailing centre; yachts are   
moored in the river, and dinghies are  
launched from the Hard. One of the     
two boat-yards also repairs Thames     
Barges. The Butt and Oyster is now the 
only Pub here but it is very popular.  </content>
