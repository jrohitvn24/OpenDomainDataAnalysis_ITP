		<content> Our squares do not contain the        
 principal shopping areas for the      
 people of Barnstaple.There are however
 two areas of shops where local people 
 buy their daily requirements.There are
  55 different shops in Newport,mostly 
 small,selling food and other          
 essentials.Suprisingly there are 5    
 D.I.Y. shops included in the total.   
    The other area of shops is Bear    
 Street.Here there are 30 shops again  
 mostly small ones.Of these 30 shops,4 
 sell second_hand furniture.Bear Street
 is just off Boutport Street which is  
 one of the main shopping streets in   
 Barnstaple.The only other shop in our 
 area is a small hypermarket on the Yeo
 Valley housing estate.
