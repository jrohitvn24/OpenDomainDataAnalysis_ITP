		<content> My family lives in a semi-detached    
 house with three bedrooms,a lounge    
 where the family can sit and relax    
 watching television, and a kitchen    
 where my mum prepares food for the    
 family to eat.My mum goes out to work 
 at the Coca-Cola factory usually      
 leaving the house at 7.30a.m.At the   
 factory she puts fizzy drink into     
 bottles.                              
  My dad goes to work at 7.00 a.m.He   
 works at the Talbot car factory in    
 Coventry where he drives a fork-lift  
 truck.                                
  My teenage brother goes to Wolston   
 High School by school bus with many   
 other teenage children who live in the
 village.                              
  My name is Sharon and I am 12 years

 School but will be going to a High    
 School later on this year.            </content>
