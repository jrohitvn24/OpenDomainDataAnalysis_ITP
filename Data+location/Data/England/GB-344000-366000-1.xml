		<title>01GOWY VALLEY GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> Between Cheshire's dominant sandstone 
 ridge and the ancient county town of  
 Chester lies the Gowy Valley. The     
 River Gowy meanders through pleasant  
 water-meadows, many now drained,which 
 are a haven for many birds, some      
 migrant. The three settlements of     
 Great Barrow, Guilden Sutton &amp;        
 Littleton flank the valley. It is     
 predominantely a farming area, which  
 these villages serve.They have been   
 expanded and most people now commute  
 to work. This reflects in the home    
 life &amp; life-style of many of the      
 inhabitants.Because the setting is    
 rural,ecology and conservation are of 
 interest to many. The communities are 
 very active reflected in clubs and    
 recreation. There is no industry but  
 trade is represented.
