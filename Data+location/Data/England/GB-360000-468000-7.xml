		<title>07ROBERT HALL - THE PLACE</title>
		<content> This land belonged to the Cantsfield  
 family in the 13 century. In about    
 1600 a shelter was provided for       
 catholic priests facing persecution.  
 The chapel ceased to be used in 1817. 
 The Hall is now a farm house. A       
 drawing of 1856 shows it to have had  
 interesting architectural features but
 these have almost all now been        
 destroyed. No structural change can   
 now take place as it is a listed      
 building. However the present tenants 
 are renovating the interior and       
 discovering all the oak beams which   
 had been plastered over. An original  
 stone fireplace has been discovered   
 and one room has beautiful oak        
 panelling covering it. The interior of
 Robert Hall will in the near future be
 restored to something approaching its 
 original state.
