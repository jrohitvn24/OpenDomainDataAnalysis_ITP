		<content>{St.Andrew's Church,}which is{900}years
 old,stands in its well_kept churchyard
 overlooking the village green. The    
 nave is{Norman.}Extensions were added 
 to the Church and the north aisle in  
 1350.The hammer beam ceiling and wagon
 roof in the chancel are 15th century. 
 The arch of the south door is 14th    
 century. The massive tower and porch  
 are probably the work of Giralano de  
 Trevise, builder of{Hampton Court,    
 which was inaugurated by{Cardinal     
{Wolsey,}who was also Lord of Sandon   
 Manor. The wooden pedestal{pulpit,}the
 finest of its kind in Essex, dates    
 from Henry VII. The stone font is 16th
 century. A{medieval pax}"a kiss of    
 peace", one of St. Andrew's treasured 
 possessions,dates from 1500 and is one
 of only two wooden varieties known.   
 The painting of St.Andrew's was a gift
 from artist Lynton Lamb.              </content>
