Blythe Colours, a factory which makes  
colour for world wide customers,       
situated in Cresswell, seven miles     
south of Stoke-on-Trent has quite a    
large workforce for this area of about 
550 people. Of these, 80 percent are   
men and 20 percent women. The age at   
which most people start work at Blythe 
Colours range from school-leavers to   
early twenties.                        
                                       
Training is available and day release  
is encouraged. To help with imports and
exports, language training is also     
given.                                 
                                       
A large proportion of the workers are  
"white-coated" ie laboratory staff.    
Only about 100 people are involved in  
prduction.
