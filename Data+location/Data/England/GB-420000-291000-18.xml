		<title>18HAMS HALL POWER STATION</title>
		<content>    The site for the Power Station was 
 bought from the Adderley Family in    
 1919. Work began on the first Power   
 Station in 1926 &amp; was finished just   
 before the Second World War. This was 
 known as Station A. A Second Station  
 (B) was completed in 1949 &amp; in 1958   
 Station C made Hams Hall the largest  
 power generating site in Europe. Now, 
 however, only C Station remains       
 functional. The Power Station is      
 coal-fired &amp; during the long coal     
 strike  which began in 1984 the       
 station continued producing           
 electricity.                          
    The CEGB Central Workshops for the 
 Midlands, National Technical Training 
 Centre, National Training Resource    
 Centre, Hydraulic-Calibration Unit &amp;  
 Non-Destructive Testing Centre are    
 also on the 1000 acre site.
