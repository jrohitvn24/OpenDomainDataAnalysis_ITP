 Money needs to be spent on small      
 companies to help them to expand. The 
 new shopping centre could create      
 competition and some existing shops   
 would not survive. Would large stores 
 be interested?'                       
 'I would like to see Gosport developed
 and in such a way as to encourage     
 trade and employment but not at the   
 expense of part of{Walpole Park.'     
{    }We know that not all of Gosport's
 residents share these views. Some feel
 that a development of the kind        
 proposed can only bring with it many  
 advantages of jobs, tourism and       
 increased trade. However, it is our   
 playing space and we want to preserve 
 it for the future.
