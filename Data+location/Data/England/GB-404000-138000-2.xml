		<content> The village of Berwick St.James has an
 adult population of 149 people        
 representing 71 family groups.        
                                       
 Whereas, in the past,before travelling
 to work became so widely              
 acceptable,the village must           
 have been almost totally dependent on 
 the farming industry, now only 18 of  
 those families are in any way         
 connected with farming.               
                                       
 22 of the families are ones where the 
 adults have retired from work.        
                                       
 The remainder,apart from the owners   
 of the shop and the managers of the   
 pub, commute to work, some to nearby  
 Forces' establishments.               
 At present, 3 families have someone   
 who is unemployed.
