 we did some English and when that was 
 over it was 12:00pm and that means    
 lunch.At about 12:20pm we had another 
 playtime until 1:00pm and after that  
 it was drama.For drama we were doing  
 about when Victoria was on the throne 
 and I was a street urchin.We did drama
 up to 2:15pm and after that we had    
 another playtime until 2:30pm.After   
 that we did some finishing of project 
 work and then at 3:05pm we went home. 
 When I got home from school i got     
 ready for cubs and then I went to     
 Lockerley for a cub meeting.When i    
 went home from cubs it was            
 8:15pm and I had my dinner,read a     
 little bit and then went to bed.
