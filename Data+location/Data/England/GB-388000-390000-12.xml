		<title>12MICRO-COMPUTERS IN STOCKPORT</title>
		<content> Micro-computers are popular both at   
 home and at school in 1985.           
 Out of 34 families with junior age    
 children at S.Paul's, 16 own a        
 computer. Some boys talked about their
 computers and their favourite games.  
  Leon said, "I like our school's BBC  
 computer. You get fast loading with   
 the disc drive. The best game is      
 Chuckie-egg."                         
  Vinny said, "I got my VIC-20 a year  
 ago. It came with a pack of books and 
 games. My best game is Kongo Kong."   
  Mark said, "The best game on my home 
 computer is Airwolf. I have learnt how
 to do a program to print my name."    
  Mike said, "I share my Spectrum with 
 my family. Our best game is Booty."
