		<content> Life at home in rural areas differs   
 only in detail from urban life, but   
 the details loom large.  Open fires   
 and solid fuel cooking stoves create  
 heavy work to add to the constant     
 battle against mud in the Winter and  
 dust in the Summer.  The lack of Town 
 gas and mains sewage in the outlying  
 areas creates its own problems.       
 Having nothing but the most basic     
 amenities makes for both self         
 sufficiency and arduous trips to      
 distant Towns.  The closing of the    
 village school sends the children from
 the village all day and transfers     
 their social centre, so that parents  
 spend much time chauffering on a rota 
 basis.  Lack of public transport      
 creates entertaiment and employment   
 problems,but despite all the          
 difficulties a strong sense of family 
 and community exists.                 </content>
