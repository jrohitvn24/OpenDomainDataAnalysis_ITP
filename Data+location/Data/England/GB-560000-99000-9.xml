		<content> My name is Kabir.  My dad owns an     
 Indian Restaurant in Seaside.  It is  
 called New Mum Tajmahal. It is very   
 busy in the summer and at weekends.   
 It also sells wines.  A set meal costs
 Â£12.                                  
                                       
 A set meal is a starter - lentil soup 
 followed by a{birany}curry or a {     
{tandoori} curry (which is baked in a  
 clay oven) or the hottest curry a {   
{vindaloo}followed by waffles. An      
 ordinary curry including rice and     
 chutney costs about Â£3.               
                                       
 Dad gets up at about 10 a.m.  The     
 restaurant is open from 12:00 until   
 2:30 p.m. and from 6:00 p.m. until    
 12:00 p.m.  People often book a       
 table in advance. There are 2         
 full-time and 1 part-time cooks       
 includng my dad.                      </content>
