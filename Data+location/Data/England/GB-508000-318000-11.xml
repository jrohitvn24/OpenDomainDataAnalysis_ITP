		<title>11BOURNE WELLHEAD</title>
		<content> The{landscape}between South and West  
 Roads includes the{Memorial Gardens. }
 This garden of remembrance, with the  
 town{War Memorial}as its central      
 feature, is a pleasant place for quiet
 relaxation. Behind the Memorial       
 Gardens is the Wellhead Field and its 
 spring-fed pool, known as St.Peter's  
 Pool, which flows through the town.   
 This once powered three water mills of
 which only Baldock's Mill remains,    
 although now lacking its water wheel. 
 The{Wellhead}is also the site of{     
{Bourne Castle,}the only evidence of   
 which remains now is the grass-covered
 ditches about the field. The castle   
 once stood on the{Wellhead}and was    
 probably built by{Hereward The Wake.}
