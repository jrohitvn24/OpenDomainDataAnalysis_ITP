		<content>    The Farm Manager is responsible for
 the livestock and growing the grain.  
 They keep beef and dairy cattle. The  
 crops they grow are spring wheat and  
 barley,and winter wheat and barley.   
 Some fields are kept for permanent    
 pasture, some are ley which is short- 
 term grass. The fields cover 1162     
 acres.                                
    For the harvest, they use 6        
 tractors and 2 combines. Crops are    
 sprayed with fungicides and herbicides
 which they spray from a mounted       
 sprayer pulled by a tractor.They make 
 sure that it is not harmful to wild   
 life.                                 
     It is helpful to keep cattle      
 because they build up fertility in the
 soil which could become nitrogen      
 deficient. Fertilisers are also used. 
    Five workers look after all this.
