		<content> There are several earthworks in our   
 area. One of which is the site of a   
 royal hunting lodge. This lodge now no
 longer exists but the site is marked  
 by several mounds.{(Section 7)}.      
                                       
 Also just below}Ashurt lodge is       
 another earthwork which consists of a 
 motte and bailey. {(Secion 11) }      
                                       
 Also near the campsite is an earthwork
 of unknown origin but is thought to be
 that of a large house or building.    
{(Section 5)}                          
                                       
 Also in our area there are many       
 tumuli. These are mainly situated     
 around sections 9,10 and 11.
