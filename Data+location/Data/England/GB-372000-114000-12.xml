		<title>12BLACKMORE VALE FARMING TREND</title>
		<content> This area,formerly known for its high 
 milk production continues to supply as
 much milk as the quota system will    
 permit.It is collected by tanker for  
 the Wincanton creamery or Sturminster 
 cheese factory.Less hay and silage are
 needed for reduced milk herds so more 
 beef cattle are being reared.         
 Again on 2 farms on the east side of  
 the area 300 and 700 pigs are being   
 fattened intensively for bacon and in 
 the south-west a flock of 300 breeding
 ewes are kept.                        
 Three areas have roughly half the     
 farmland used for arable crops mainly 
 wheat and barley with a few oats.Some 
 of this is used for silage,especially 
 as bad weather upset the harvesting.  
 Most of the livestock is bought and   
 sold at Sturminster Newton cattle     
 market,the biggest calf market in     
 England.Pigs go to local bacon factory</content>
