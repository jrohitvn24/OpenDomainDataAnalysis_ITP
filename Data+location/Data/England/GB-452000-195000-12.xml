		<content>   There are a few active  social clubs
 in the village such as a branch of the
 Womens' Institute,  Scouts, Guides and
 Cubs.  There  is  a  sports Club which
 supports  two  cricket  teams  and  a 
 football  squad.  A flourishing tennis
 club  uses courts  which belong to the
 manor, however  many  of  its  members
 come from outside the village.        
                                       
   As in  many  villages  there are few
 community activities  specifically for
 teenagers.  A  youth  club was started
 about  a year  ago, but it has already
 ceased  to  meet.  One  of  the  major
 problems  appears  to  be a  lack of a
 suitable, willing leader.             
                                       
   This summer the  village organised a
 Clifton  Hampden Festival Weekend with
 events which included a concert in the
 Manor gardens and a Barn Dance.       </content>
