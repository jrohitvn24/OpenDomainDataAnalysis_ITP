		<content> One of the games the girls like to    
 play is Red Letter .This is how we    
 play it.We all line up and there is 1 
 person at the other end of the        
 playground.The person says "The{Red   
{letter}is A"for instance,and that     
 means that you can't move when that   
 person says A.Then she will say a lot 
 of letters and we move 1 space if the 
 letter is in our name.The first one to
 the other end is the winner.          
 Another game we like to play is{Chain 
{Hit}.One  person is hit and they run  
 around trying to catch the other      
 children.When they catch somebody they
 hold hands with the person who is hit 
 and run around catching everyone      
 else.The first person to be caught is 
 hit for next time.                    
 2 other games we enjoy are Station and
 London.
