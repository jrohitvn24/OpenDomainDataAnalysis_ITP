		<title>16Sport in Cotton End</title>
		<content> Cotton End has 2 football teams, both 
 of which play in local leagues.At     
 present their playing field in the    
 village has a drainage problem but it 
 is hoped that the work required to    
 repair this will soon be carried out. 
 Table tennis and pool are played in   
 the village hall by the Youth Club.   
 Those looking for a wider range       
 of sports facilities may travel to the
 Bunyan Sports Centre in Bedford,      
 approximately 2 miles away.
