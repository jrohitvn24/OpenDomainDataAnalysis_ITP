		<title>16KEMBLE RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content>  People travel from all over the      
 country to take pictures and film {   
{Kemble Station.}Once an American      
 tourist offered to buy it and ship it 
 home! Many people bring their friends 
 to look around its attractive gardens 
 and admire its architecture and       
 decorations.                          
  It must be the only station to       
 actually get presents from passengers,
 many of whom by-pass other stations   
 just so they can travel from{Kemble. }
 Even though they get their daily rush 
 of over 100{London}bound commuters,   
 the staff take their time to listen to
 people's news and hear a joke.
