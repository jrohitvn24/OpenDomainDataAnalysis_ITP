		<content>{    LIFE IN St.KEVERNE 50 YEARS AGO   
 Life in St. Keverne 50 years ago was  
 hard because we had no electricity or 
 gas only oil lamps and candles.  We   
 cooked on old Cornish ranges.  We had 
 a council estate but not as many      
 houses as today.  Transport was by    
 motor buses, horseback and 'shanks    
 pony'.  There was no tourist industry 
 like today.  People were employed on  
 farms, fishing and the quarries.      
 Everyone went to church or chapel and 
 we entertained ourselves by sewing,   
 rug making, fret work and singing.  We
 had no mains water.  Where the bus    
 shelter is now was a well from which  
 we drew our water.  We had one doctor 
 but not a health centre.  There was   
 only one school building which we went
 to until we were 14.  Life was harder 
 and we were poorer but we were happy.
