		<title>10FARMING</title>
		<content>Our area is rural. Our farmers grow    
cereals such as oil seed rape, maize,  
wheat and barley. Other crops are grown
for seed such as peas, beans and       
cabbages. At Hullberry Farm there is a 
dairy farm. They have a prize pedigree 
herd of cows. The prize herd are       
Friesians, they are black and white. To
identify the cows they have ear tags   
with a number on and the same number is
put inside the cows ear, incase the tag
falls out. Each calf is dehorned, and  
when young its own particular hide     
pattern is sketched and is recorded.   
Just like our fingerprints, each       
pattern is individual. Farmer          
Alexander, is an expert on Friesians   
and gives lectures all over the world. 
We have been to his farm.
