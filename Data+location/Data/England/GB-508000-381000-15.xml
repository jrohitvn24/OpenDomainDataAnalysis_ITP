 keynote to art in this village. There

 designs knitwear, her husband teaches 
 painting and sells his paintings at   
 exhibitions. We have an architect

 works in silver and gold at home. One

 furniture for house and garden,       
 another restores &amp; repairs Churches &amp; 
 houses. A young mother teaches art in 
 a comprehensive school. A woodworker  
 with a degree in painting makes       
 beehives. The ladies in the village   
 knit &amp; design clothes for their       
 families &amp; regular meetings are held  
 by Church ladies who embroider for the
 Church &amp; sell craft work for Church   
 funds.
