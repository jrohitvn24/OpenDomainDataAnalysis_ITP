		<title>13The Station in Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>Situated just outside the centre of    
Wolverhampton is the railway station.It
plays a major part in the transport    
system.The station has easy access to  
London,Birmingham,Manchester and       
Glasgow.                               
There used to be two stations but      
during the 1960s the other,Low Level,  
became less used.In 1969 the regular   
services ended and there were only     
trains to Birmingham.In 1972 the       
station finally closed down.           
The main reason for its closing was    
because more lines ran through the     
present station.High Level station was 
rebuilt and modernised in the late     
1960s.                                 
Many people think that the older       
station should have been kept due to   
the fact that it was an example of good
railway architecture with a domed roof.
