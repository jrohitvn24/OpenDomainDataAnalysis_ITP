   The walk, each Whit Sunday, is a    
 procession of witness to the Christian
 faith &amp; has taken place for well over 
 a century.                            
   In 1985 police closed the main road 
 for 1\ hours as about 2000 people     
 walked. Nearly 5000 lined the streets 
 to watch the spectacle which included 
 6 huge banners, 9 bands, Rose queen   
 with attendants &amp; colourful, large    
 religious texts. The larger banners   
 needed 2 men wearing special harnesses
 to carry them and 4 people to hold guy
 ropes.                                
   Ten chuches of different            
 denominations were represented. A     
 short act of worship at St Leonard's  
 church was led by ministers of these  
 denominations.
