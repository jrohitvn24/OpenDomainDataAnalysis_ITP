		<title>11A Ringmer Blacksmith's Day</title>
		<content> A{Blacksmith's day}starts at around   
 eight o'clock. The first job he does  
 is to light the coals of the{forge.}  
 Then he stokes the forge to get the   
 coals glowing red. The{horses}then    
 arrive to be{shod.}He has to trim the{
{hoof}before fitting a new shoe. He has
 already got horseshoes made but he may
 have to re-adjust them to fit.        
 Sometimes he has to make a complete   
 new shoe from a straight concave bar. 
 It takes around{1.5 hours}to shoe a   
 horse. Sometimes he travels to the    
 horse with his{mobile forge.}If he has
 no horses to be shod he will do any{  
 welding jobs, make wrought iron gates}
 or sharpen any tools, put handles on  
 spades, put iron tyres on wooden cart 
 wheels. His day finishes at around    
 five o'clock
