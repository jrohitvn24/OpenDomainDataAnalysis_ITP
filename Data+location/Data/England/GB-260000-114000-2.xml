		<title>02BURRINGTON RADAR STATION</title>
		<content>  Mr. Crisp told us that it is the most
 westerly of the eight radar stations  
 which control civil aircraft by       
 overlapping radar cover. Civil        
 aircraft fly at a minimum height of   
 20,000 ft. on special routes between  
 reporting points. The airways,        
 identified by a colour and a number,  
 are 1,000 ft. apart. Our radar station
 was built by 1973 and employs 16      
 people. Radar works by line of sight. 
 There are{two green primary scanners  
 which receive reflections from        
 weather, hills and planes from a pulse
 of 2 million watts. The{two grey SSR  
{scanners}receive signals from planes  
 carrying special equipment. These are 
 turned into computer information which
 is sent to West Drayton.The cabins on 
 the towers house the motors which     
 rotate the scanners 8 times a minute. 
 The scanners have a{160 mile range.}  </content>
