		<title>17FRIMLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Frimley has developed  
 over the years and is now part of a   
{sprawling connurbation}which spreads  
 from Camberley to Farnham and across  
 to Fleet.  Originally it was used by  
 the{army}and they maintain their      
 presence with a{cadet}training centre 
 on the western edge of the village.   
 The{village centre}consists mainly of 
 shops selling food,drink, and         
 hardware goods and has only one small 
 supermarket.{Buses}connect with most  
 local centres, and the{railway}has a  
 half hourly service to those which are
 more distant, as well as an hourly    
 service to{London.}The{M3}motorway can
 be reached at the nearby junction 4   
 and this allows access to{London in 35
{minutes.}As a consequence most local  
 people do only day to day shopping in 
 the village prefering to go elsewhere 
 for larger items and quantities.      </content>
