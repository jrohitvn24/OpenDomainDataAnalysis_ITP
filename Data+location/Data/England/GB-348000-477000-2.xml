		<title>02Beetham School</title>
		<content> There has been a school in the village
 of Beetham since the late 16th        
 century.                              
  In  1633 the school was located on   
 the site of the present Ashton House. 
 Later it is believed that children    
 were taught in one of the cottages    
 near the church. This would be a dame 
 school.                               
       Much later on the school was    
 moved to a permanent building on the  
 edge of the village opposite the      
 present school. This building is still
 standing and is used by South         
 Westmorland stage and screen society. 
     In 1904 the present school was    
 built on the site of a former toll    
 house,part of which can still be seen 
 forming the entrance cloakroom.       
       The school still has its close  
 links with the church.
