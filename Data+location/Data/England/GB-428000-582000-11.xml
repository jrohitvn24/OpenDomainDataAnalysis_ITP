		<content> Our school teaches girls and boys     
 between the ages of 9 and 13.All of   
 the pupils travel to school in        
 Jordan's coaches as the houses in the 
 area were demolished when the local   
 pit closed some years ago.            
   There are about 360 pupils at       
 present but the numbers have fallen in
 recent years.We have twenty teachers  
 including Mr Surtees our headmaster.  
 Attached to the school is a partial   
 hearing unit but this will be moving  
 next year(September 1985).            
   There are 15 classrooms including 4 
 mobiles as well as a dining room/gym. 
 Our school is unusual because we have 
 stables attached and pupils can go    
 horse riding. In the quadrangle we    
 have a 3x2 metre pond which was built 
 by Mr. Ogilvie our science teacher in 
 1980. See W.Sleekburn M.School Staff
