		<content> The Pottery can be found next to the  
 only Village Shop, by the Bridge.     
  When the Children asked{Mr Andrews   
 about Prickwillow Pottery, this was   
 his reply. 'We started this Pottery   
 about 10 years ago, it used to be Coal
 Sheds and Garages. There aren't many  
 people at Prickwillow so it is        
 friendly and the Community like the   
 Pottery. I enjoy Pottery because I    
 can see how much I have done. Each Pot
 is slightly different, it has a life  
 of its own. We don't use local Clay as
 it does not fire well. We use         
 Staffordshire and{Devon Clay.}We mix  
 them depending on the job. I use about
 12 hundredweights a week. If I have a 
 special order it takes 2 or 3 weeks to
 make'. While we were there we saw     
 pots, vases, plaques, bird whistles,  
 money boxes and pieces to make up     
 dolls.                                </content>
