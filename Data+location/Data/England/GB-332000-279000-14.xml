		<title>14PURSLOW SHOW, CLUNTON</title>
		<content> Purslow Show is the big event of the  
 year. It is always held on the Summer 
 Bank Holiday Monday in a field lent by
  a farmer in Clunton. The show        
 committee arrange the main show ring  
 which this year included a Wild West  
 show. It also includes grass track    
 racing, gymknana and other sports and 
 competitions as well as fancy dress.  
 The organization of the produce tent  
 is done by the Women's Institute      
 starting several months in advance,   
 revising and printing schedules and   
 booking judges. The produce section   
 includes the following classes; arts  
 and crafts, flower arranging, cookery,
 store cupboard, garden produce and    
 children's work from Clunbury School. 
 Outside the tent a line of scarecrows 
 compete for first prize in bird       
 scaring (in the opinion of the judges 
 that is, no-one asks the birds).      </content>
