   Gardening is the most popular hobby.
 Most adults like listening to

 pop music. For people who do active   
 sports most do football and cricket.  
 These are also popular spectator      
 sports.                               
   Those who have computers usually use
 them for playing games.               
   Regarding TV the survey found that  
 children liked films while adults     
 liked documentaries best. Sports      
 programmes were popular as well.

 families never went to church. Most   
 took holidays in Britain. Most shopped
 in supermarkets. The Glossop Chronicle
