		<title>10ATTITUDES IN BEDWORTH</title>
		<content> "The Newdigate Park,Community Centre &amp;
 the Rec is where we can play{games.   
 Other fields belong to farmers &amp; are  
 private land.Sometimes we play on car 
 parks,but there is a lot of broken    
 glass.That is all there is for us to  
 do unless we go into town.We found an 
 old stable,in Goodyers End Lane.On the
 wall was some graffiti.{Graffiti}is   
 words which have been sprayed on walls
 in different colours.Some of the words
 were FUNCTION,HIP-HOP,BREAK and       
 UP-ROCK.If I had a chance to live     
 anywhere else I would,because{vandals 
 are shattering windows,telephones     
 boxes &amp; bus stands. I like my house   
 but not the street &amp; I wouldn't like  
 to live in Bedworth."
