		<content> The village of{Kemble}in{             
{Gloucestershire}is situated 4 miles   
 S.E. of{Cirencester}on both sides of  
 the main A 429 road to{Malmesbury.}It 
 is located amidst undulating,         
 attractive countryside at the head of 
 the upper{Thames}valley and is the    
 nearest village to the traditional    
 source of the{River Thames.           
  The name{Kemble}is probably derived  
 from the early Saxon word meaning     
 "boundary". Until 1896{Kemble}and     
 Poole Keynes were part of Wiltshire.  
  The village grew in size when the    
{Great Western Railway}line was built  
 in 1841. In the centre of{Kemble}there
 is an elevated village green with an  
 old drinking fountain in a{Cotswold   
 stone arched shelter.
