		<title>09TEN TORS</title>
		<content> The TEN TORS expedition is held in May
 each year. Teams of young people make 
 up the total of 2400 walkers. Teams   
 have six members and cover routes of  
 35, 45, or 55 miles depending on their
 age and experience. Each route takes  
 the team to 'Ten Tors', where check-  
 points record their progress. Each    
 team has to camp over night, and must 
 carry all the food and equipment      
 needed to do this. Although there is a
 time limit for completion of the      
 course Ten Tors is not a race. Those  
 who complete their Ten Tors receive   
 medals and complete teams a           
 certificate.                          
 Ten Tors is the climax of months of   
 training by the teams, many of which  
 travel long distances to the moor at  
 weekends. Both the training and the   
 expedition are valuable experiences   
 for the young people involved.        </content>
