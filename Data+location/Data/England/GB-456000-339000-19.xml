		<title>19NOTTINGHAM OLD MARKET SQUARE</title>
		<content> The Market Square has an interesting  
 history.It's called the Market Square 
 because a market used to be held      
 there.Old women use the square as a   
 chatting place and from time to       
 time,when our teams win the F.A.Cup or
 our famous skating stars Torvill and  
 Dean come home,celebrations are held  
 there.The Queen sometimes comes there 
 and takes a look round the Council    
 House, signing the visitor's book in  
 the Lord Mayor's Parlour.The fountains
 outside the Council House make it     
 stand out and make the square more    
 pleasant.Pigeons go and perch there   
 for the day and people bring bread    
 for them to eat.They leave an         
 unpleasant mess for us to clean up.The
 Council are talking about spending    
 money to make the square look better.
