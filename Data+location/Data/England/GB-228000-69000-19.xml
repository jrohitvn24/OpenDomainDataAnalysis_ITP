		<content> The building of a{Community Centre}in 
 Pensilva has caused a lot of argument 
 about the amenities in the village. We
 made a short questionnaire to test    
 people's opinions. We received 86     
 replies out of 100 forms.             
 The results were :                    
                                       
{Q. Are you in favour of a community   
{centre being built ?                  
     YES    92%      NO    8%          
{Q. Why are you for/against the idea ? 
 Something for young people     39%    
 Improve community spirit       27%    
 More local amenities           23%    
 Present buildings too small     8%    
                                       
 Those against the idea felt that      
 either there was no need, no community
 spirit or no money.
