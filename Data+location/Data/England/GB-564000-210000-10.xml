   Chignal Smealy has two churches;    
St. Nicholas and the United Reformed.  
St. Nicholas' first rector was Jordamus
Baratine in 1339. There is service held
every Sunday. The United Reformed      
Church held there first service on the 
5th June 1842. The first minister was  
Henry Wardley. This is also the nearest
place of worship for Mashbury. Today   
only a limited number visit Sunday     
School.                                
   Mashbury Church is now closed as a  
vicar can no longer be made available  
due too the low numbers.At Chignal St. 
James there is and old church; St Marys
which has been converted into a house. 
   The Savation Army church in Barrack 
road was built in 1890. The nearest    
Church of England church is in Good    
Easter.
