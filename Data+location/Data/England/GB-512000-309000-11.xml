		<content>                                       
 The Domesday Book mentions the parish 
 under its the name of Est Depinge.    
 The Priory Church was built in 1139   
 as a cell to Thorney Abbey but the    
 spire and tower were rebuilt in       
 1717.The font is made from a single   
 block of Caen stone and has patterns  
 of Norman arches round the side.During
 the 18th century the nave roof was    
 lowered and flat ceilings erected.    
 During recent repairs a stone coffin  
 of the 13th century was discovered.The
 coffin was supporting the floor and   
 contained the major part of a         
 skeleton.The organ is of fine quality,
 it was built in St.Martins Church,    
 Lincoln about 1911.The church         
 originally had five bells dating from 
 1608 to 1704 but a sixth bell has been
 added in recent years.The whole peal  
 weighs over four tons.                </content>
