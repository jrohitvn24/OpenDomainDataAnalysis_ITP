		<title>11 A VISIT TO STRATFORD MARKET</title>
		<content>  WE WERE GREETED BY THE STRONG SMELL  
OF FISH ON ARRIVING AT THE MARKET.     
ROTHER STREET HAD BECOME LIKE A HIVE OF
BEES.THE MARKET IS QUITE CENTRALLY     
SITUATED IN THE TOWN.LOCALS AND OUT-   
SIDERS FIND IT CONVENIENT FOR THEM,    
SINCE THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF DAILY   
ITEMS AVAILABLE,EG.CLOTHES(UNDERWEAR,  
DRESSES,CHILDRENS' CLOTHES,ETC),SHOES, 
MATERIALS AND FABRICS,JEWELLERY,NEEDLE-
WORK(COTTON,LACE,ZIP-FASTENERS,ETC),   
LEATHER AND SKIN PRODUCTS,THINGS FOR   
THE HOME(PICTURES,PLANTS,CROCKERY,TOYS,
ORNAMENTS,HARDWARE,WICKERWORK,FLOWERS),
BIRTHDAY CARDS,AND FOOD(MEAT,FISH,FRUIT
AND VEGETABLES,DAIRY PRODUCTS,PET FOOD 
AND HEALTH FOOD).                      
  THE STALL-HOLDERS COME FROM NEIGH-   
BOURING TOWNS EG.REDDITCH AND          
BIRMINGHAM,BUT MANY OF THEM ARE CENTRED
IN OR NEAR TO STRATFORD ITSELF.
