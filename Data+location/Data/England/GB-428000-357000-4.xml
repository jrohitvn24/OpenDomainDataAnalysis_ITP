		<content> The{Colour Works}stands on the east   
 bank of the River Derwent.The factory 
 produces powdered pigments used in    
 colouring paint,rubber,plastics and   
 concrete.These are made from natural  
 minerals,originally found locally,    
 such as lead and iron oxide and lime- 
 stone.30% of colours produced are     
 exported.The colours are mainly       
 transported by road in 25 kilo sacks. 
 Although the buildings are old and    
 shed-like the company is now using    
 computers in its administration.It is 
 also now using new high-pressure steam
 compressed air crushing machinery.The 
 minerals are crushed,ground and       
 blended at the works.Red,yellow and   
 brown pigments are in greatest demand.
 River Derwent water powers a small    
 turbine but the majority of elec-     
 tricity used comes from the National  
 Grid.                                 </content>
