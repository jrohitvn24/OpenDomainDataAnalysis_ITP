		<title>20 St. Peter's Church Newton</title>
		<content>  The first ever recorded date of the  
church was 1212.                       
  As you enter you see a font in front 
of you, it was made in the 14th C. and 
has 8 sides.The cover is a jagged cone.
  Some of the side windows have stained
glass panels of figures and patterns.  
Some of this glass is amongst the      
oldest in the Midlands. One window     
shows two of the apostles. These were  
painted in about 1420. The main East   
window is more recent and was given by 
a woman in memory of her husband.      
  There are six  stone priests' seats  
at the side of the church near the     
altar table.There are also two brasses 
on the floor nearby. A screen erected  
in memory of those who died in the war,
it divides the church into two parts.  
  Nearly all the village are involved  
with the church in some way. About 30  
people regularly attend services.      </content>
