		<content> Peasedown, the largest of the villages
 in the area, is a typical example of  
 1930's ribbon development. It consists
 of three parts ,Peasedown, Lower      
 Peasedown and Ashgrove, all of which  
 have now merged together. The village 
 now stretches for about 1.5 miles     
 along the main road -A367. There is a 
 new youth club situated alongside the 
 old school providing a stark contrast 
 in building styles. The youth club    
 offers a wide range of activities,    
 and there is also a play group which  
 hold sessions there each morning.     
                                       
 The village also has very well        
 supported football and cricket clubs. 
 The Catholic club of St Josephs is a  
 social club situated near Ashgrove.
