		<title>07   THE SWINTON ESTATE</title>
		<content>    In 1695 Abstruptus Danby bought the
 manor of Swinton and built a manor    
 house there.Over the years stables,   
 fine gates, and a chain of lakes were 
 added.In the 19th century the house   
 was castellated.                      
    The present Lord Masham no longer  
 lives there, Swinton Castle having    
 been sold in the mid-seventies to help
 pay of death duties.It was bought by  
 the Lindley Educational Trust which   
 was established 30 years ago to train 
 people in industry through outdoor    
 experience.                           
   The Earl of Swinton, David Cunliffe-
 Lister,is Education Spokesman in the  
 House Of Lords.His wife Baroness      
 Masham is well known as a peeress and 
 a champion for the disabled since a   
 riding accident paralysed her 20 years
 ago. Swinton Estate employs 35 people 
 in farming and gamekeeping.           </content>
