		<content>    In the 16th century the house      
 belonged to the Whitbread Family who  
 were the Lords of the Manor. They     
 built a new manor called White Notley 
 Hall and Fambridge became a farm      
 again. Today the farm has been sold   
 and the house is now a family home.   
    The house that stands today dates  
 from several different times but the  
 main part is from the late 18th       
 century. The house is mainly lathe and
 plaster with only very small parts    
 (the cellar and the chimneys) being of
 brick.                                
    Inside the house is on several     
 different levels because of movement  
 since it was built so some doors are a
 strange shape.                        
    The cellars were used for storing  
 food to keep it cool in the days      
 before fridges and freezers.
