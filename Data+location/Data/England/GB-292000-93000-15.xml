		<title>15Playground Games. Part 1.</title>
		<content> Whipton Barton First School decided to
 write about the games that they play  
 in the playground and some of the     
 songs they sing to them.              
  In the playground some of us play    
 clapping games like this...'A sailor  
 went to sea, sea, sea, to see what he 
 could see, see, see, but all that he  
 could see, see, see was the bottom of 
 the deep blue sea, sea, sea'. We also 
 clap to:'My mummy is a baker, yummy,  
 yummy, yummy. My daddy is a dustman,  
 poohy, poohy, poohy. My sister is a   
 showoff, coory, coory, coory. My      
 brother is a cowboy, brag, bang,      
 clap'.                                
  We also play other games. The best is
 Cat and Frog. We also sing 'A sailor  
 went to leg, leg, leg, to see what he 
 could leg, leg, leg, but all that he  
 could leg, leg, leg, was the bottom of
 the deep blue leg, leg, leg'.         </content>
