		<content> The first thing of interest to the    
 legend hunter in this area is the     
{tunnel}reputed to have been built by  
 the Saxons to connect the church      
 of St Wystans to Newton Solney Church 
 a distance of over 4 miles.           
 Legend has it that the{ Vikings}sailed
 up the Old Trent and came into        
 conflict with the{Anglo-Saxons}and    
 that there was a huge and bloody      
 battle.                               
 In 1726 a certain Dr.Degge was told by
 a labourer that he had unearthed a    
 stone dormitory inside which was a 9  
 foot coffin. The labourer claimed that
 it contained a{giant}surrounded by 100
 men with their feet pointing in       
 towards the giant. He took the skull  
 and planted a sycamore seed on top of 
 it. The tree is still growing and in  
 1920 the grave was rediscovered again 
 but with no sign of the giant.        </content>
