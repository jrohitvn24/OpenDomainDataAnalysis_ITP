		<title>07Redlynch Park.</title>
		<content>  The old house at  {Redlynch}was built
 by the Earl of Ilchester (one of whose
 titles was the Baron of Redlynch),    
 and what is now known as 'The Towers' 
 was the original grand entrance       
 leading to the house.  It was built   
 to impress George III, who often      
 visited Redlynch on his way to and    
 from Weymouth. By the early 20th      
 century, a second house was built     
 adjacent to the first, which was      
 falling into a state of disrepair.    
 This unoccupied house was burnt by    
 suffragettes and nothing now remains  
 of it.  Redlynch Park was owned by the
 Countess of Suffolk and Berkshire     
 until the 1960's;  she employed over  
 50 staff.  It then became a girls'    
 finishing school and cookery college, 
 until 1981.  The House and Stables    
 were sold for conversion into flats,  
 but this project is still incomplete. </content>
