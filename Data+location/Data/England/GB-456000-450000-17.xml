		<content>{ Jubilee Terrace Garden.}B.R.built a  
 high concrete wall in front of the    
 houses in Jubilee Terrace.When people 
 look out of their windows it is       
 miserable and dull.The path was       
 changed into a garden so that the wall
 would be bright,living and            
 cheerful.St.Barnabas' School          
 volunteered to care for the garden.   
  There is a new{flood barrier}near    
 Clifton Ings because the{River Ouse   
 flooded into all the houses.There is a
 big wall in front of the houses in    
 Earlsborough Terrace to stop the river
 flooding them.                        
{ Our hedge}is in Ousecliffe Gardens at
 Clifton.We have gone to the hedge     
 every Monday since September.We look  
 at the trees and other things,and we  
 do the temperature.We have planted    
 daffodils there.                      
                                       </content>
