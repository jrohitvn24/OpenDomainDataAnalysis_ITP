		<content>On Wednesday 10th of July we went on a 
survey around Sevenoaks district. We   
had to note down all the different     
schools and churches we saw. We went   
with Mrs. Spencer in her car. As we    
went along we told jokes to each other.
We started in Sevenoaks, then we went  
on to Godden Green, Seal and           
Underriver. The schools we saw were    
Sevenoaks School,  a secondary school  
for girls and boys, in Sevenoaks High  
Street; St. Johns Primary School, St.  
Johns Hill, primary school for girls   
and boys; Wilderness, Seal Hollow Road,
secondary school for boys; Dorton      
House, Seal Hollow Road, a school for  
the blind; Walthamstow Hall, Holly Bush
Lane, school for girls age 5 to 18.    
We arrived back at school at 15.10.
