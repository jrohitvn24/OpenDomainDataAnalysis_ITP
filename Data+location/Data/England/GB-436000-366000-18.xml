		<content>   Our school,{Hunloke Park,}is getting
 bigger. Next term we are having a new 
 class because of all the children     
 moving into the new houses. We will   
 have 4 infant and 4 junior classes.   
   The oldest class, the 4th years,    
 help the infants alot, taking them to 
 their classes at the end of playtime  
 or by looking after them indoors      
 during 'wet play'. They also serve the
 younger ones at the dinner tables.    
   The{school day}starts at 9.00am,    
 but alot of children come earlier to  
 practice music, gymnastics or plays   
 which they perform in asssembly.      
    There is a 20 minute break in the  
 morning, 1hr 15mins for lunch and 15  
 mins in the afternoon.  School ends at
 3.15pm for infants  and 3.30pm for    
 juniors.                              
     At playtime children play a wide  
 variety of games or just sit and chat.</content>
