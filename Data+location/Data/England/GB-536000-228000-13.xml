    We went to Diane Hair International
 but it was full up and they could not 
 answer any questions. We then went to 
 Cut Above but they said to call back  
 later as they were too busy also. Then
 we went to the tattooist but that was 
 shut.We then went to 'Personalities'  
 and we asked some questions. We asked 
 what the most popular haircut was and 
 how much does it cost. The answer was 
 a layered haircut and it costs Â£2.00. 
 We then asked what haircut costs the  
 most. The answer was the longer the   
 hair the more it costs.It could vary  
 to about Â£4.00. We then asked which is
 the cheapest haircut. The answer was  
 Â£1.00 for a baby's haircut. We asked  
 how many years you have to train as   
 a barber. The answer was 5 years for a
 professional and 3 years for an       
 apprentice.                           </content>
