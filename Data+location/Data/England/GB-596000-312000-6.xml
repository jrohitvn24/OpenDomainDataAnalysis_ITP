		<content> The biennial Festival, runs for       
 approximately a fortnight in May. It  
 caters for all tastes and includes    
 classical music, pop music, theatrical
 performances and social gatherings.   
 Events are held in various venues such
 as the Memorial Hall, local school    
 halls and private homes.              
 Some performers are professional      
 artistes and some local amateurs.     
 The organisers are a Committee of     
 local enthusiasts who give their time 
 voluntarily to bringing culture and   
 entertainment to the town and         
 surrounding villages.                 
 The town also has an annual "Quiz"    
 when local organisations, offices and 
 firms enter teams to compete for a    
 trophy by answering questions on a    
 diversity of subjects. There is a     
 series of eliminating rounds ending   
 in a final between the two best teams.</content>
