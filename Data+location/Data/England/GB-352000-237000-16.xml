		<title>16Hampton House.</title>
		<content>   As we walked around Hampton Bishop  
 we saw a very impressive building     
 called Hampton House.                 
                                       
   It is a large, two-storey, detached 
 building with an annexe which is a    
 converted farm building.It is         
 approachrd by a fairly long drive and 
 has large predominantly lawned        
 gardens.                              
                                       
   The house was bought by the         
 Herefordshire Old Peoples Housing     
 Society in 1951 and was converted into
 an old peoples' home.                 
                                       
  In 1952 the home was able to         
 accommodate 17 residents but now there
 are over 30 residents.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
