		<title>06THE HOBBY OF A KEELBY CHILD</title>
		<content> My name is Paul Webster, I am 11 years
 old and I am in the top year.One of my
 favourite dates which comes every     
 month is the day I go to Astronomy    
 Club in Cleethorpes, a nearby town.   
 Altogether there are about 60 members 
 of the club, just 5 of which are      
 children.I've been going there for    
 1\ years, and intend to continue.     
   We have a long talk with the        
 lecturer, and he usually brings things
 like old car axles and tells you how  
 to make a first class telescope out of
 them (the clubs telescope is made out 
 of a car axle and other car pieces).  
 At the last meeting he brought a gas  
 pump and a speckled balloon.He pumped 
 up the balloon, and you keep your eyes
 on a dot.All the dots move away from  
 it.This demonstrates why all the other
 galaxys seem to be moving away from   
 ours.                                 </content>
