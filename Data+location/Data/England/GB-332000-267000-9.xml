		<title>09FARMING. SILAGE AT WILLEY.</title>
		<content> Winter feed for sheep and cattle can  
 be provided by storing grass as;      
 1) Hay which is dried grass cut &amp;     
 collected in June or July and made    
 into bales to be stored in dry, airy  
 conditions.                           
 2) Silage which is grass cut, chopped 
 and compressed in deep pits which are 
 covered in polythene &amp; weighted down  
 with used car tyres. Silage can also  
 be stored by compressing the chopped  
 grass into huge black plastic bags and
 covered to protect from mice.         
 The second method enables grass to be 
 cut over a longer period and in less  
 dry weather.                          
 Silage is a popular method of         
 providing winter feed at Willey and   
 has resulted in a local shortage of   
 plastic bags in 1985!
