established by Misses E.T.and V.M.     
Longe in 1965. Thirty acres of Abbots  
Hall Estate are used although seventy

acres. There are carts, wagons,        
agricultural machinery, re-erected     
buildings,craft demonstrations,        
industrial and domestic displays. The  
oldest exhibit is a thirteenth century 
barn.It is continually collecting      
items which have to be conserved under 
cover.Presently thousands of exhibits  
are shown.Last year 34,000 people      
visited,of all ages. It is very cheap  
at one pound twenty pence for adults   
,60p for children,and 70p for OAPs.
