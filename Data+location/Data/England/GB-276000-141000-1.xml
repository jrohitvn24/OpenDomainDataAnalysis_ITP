     The Lancombe area of Exmoor is    
  mainly moorland. The average height  
 is 1200 - 1400 feet above sea level.  
 The area has several spurs and also   
 valleys.                              
                                       
     The moorland is wet and marshy    
 when situated next to streams. There  
 is an east/west ridge which forms a   
 watershed. The water flows south to   
 the English Channel via the river Exe,
 and north to the Bristol Channel.     
                                       
     In the area grows cotton grass and
 Sphagnum bog species. The walled parts
 are in the south, close to the roads. 
                                       
     It is very hard, if not           
 impossible, to grow anything on this  
 land.                                 
                                       </content>
