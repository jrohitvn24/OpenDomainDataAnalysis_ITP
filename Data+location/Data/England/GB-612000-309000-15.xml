  After the food rationing of the{2nd  
{World war,}the{Loveday Report of 1945 
 suggested that{every county}should    
 have a college to{produce trained farm
{workers.}The land in Easton was bought
 in{1949.}It was chosen because it was 
{central in Norfolk,}and available at  
 the time. The{Horticulture}college is 
 situated{17 miles}away at{Burlingham, 
 but the statistics of this college is 
 included in the data. The first       
 students came in{1951,}and the college
 buildings were officially opened in   
{1953.
