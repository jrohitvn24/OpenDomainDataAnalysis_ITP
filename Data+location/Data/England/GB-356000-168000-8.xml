		<content>{LANDSCAPE}                            
 Headley Park is built on top of a     
 hill. That is where it got its name   
 from. Head because it was high up and 
 ley because it had lots of grasslands.
  There is a big stream in{Headley Park
 called the Malago which has           
 uncultivated grassland on both sides. 
 In the Malago or Manor Woods there are
 very steep slopes (we call them donkey
 slides). There is a big grassland     
 called Highridge Common. In Headley   
 Park and Bedminster Down there are    
 allotments _ one in Headley Lane and  
 another in Bishopsworth Road. There   
 are lots of playing fields in the     
 area. There is a church called St.    
 Peter's Church. It was built in 1842  
 and all of the stone was imported from
 Caen in France. There are some        
 industrial buildings mainly warehouses
 for a supermarket chain.  A.MOORE.    </content>
