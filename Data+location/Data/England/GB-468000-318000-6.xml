		<content> I collect football programmes.They are
 the programmes that you get at        
 football matches and they tell you the
 team and all about them.You get good  
 programmes in the First Division and  
 not so good in the Second             
 Division.They cost in the range of    
 30pence to 50pence but Cup game       
 programmes are about Â£1 or Â£2.Football
 programmes are like little books.I    
 first started because my Grandma was  
 going to throw away some old Leicester
 City programmes( they are a local     
 football team) and so I had them off  
 her.I've collected them ever since.I  
 am in a programme club where you send 
 25p and you get three programmes free 
 and a catalogue that you can buy more 
 programmes from.
