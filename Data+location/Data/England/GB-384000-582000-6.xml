		<title>06IRON WORKS</title>
		<content>  The iron works was in{Hareshaw Lynn. 
 It was a place where iron ore was     
 taken from the ground and {smelted}in 
 coke ovens.They sent the iron to      
 Tyneside to be sold. Some was used to 
 build the High Level Bridge in        
 Newcastle.                            
  The workers lived in tiny houses     
 specially built,but now there is      
 only one short terrace left and the   
 names Foundry Farm and Foundry Yard.  
 Here small{factories}are now being    
 built.                                
  About ten years ago there was a flood
 which altered the course of the stream
 revealing an old wagon truck and rails
 used in the{iron works.               
  All around the countryside small     
 humps can be seen.They were spoil     
 heaps from the{mines.}Now they are    
 grass covered and some have special   
 names like the{Blue Heaps}at Blakelaw.</content>
