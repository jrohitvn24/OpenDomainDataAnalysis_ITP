		<content> BIRD LIFE                             
 Bird life is very varied and includes 
 several of the hawk family - buzzard, 
 merlin, sparrow-hawk and kestrel. The 
 buzzard, sometimes known as the small 
 golden eagle, is fairly numerous.     
 Until myxamatosis killed off many of  
 the rabbits, it was these that made up
 a high proportion of a buzzard's diet.
 This bird is also the enemy of snakes.
 There are grouse, blackcock, woodcock 
 snipe and what is also known to be on 
 the moor and is surprising is that    
 there are also wild duck and heron.   
 OTHER ANIMALS                         
 The hare, badger, fox, weasel and     
 stote are common.
