		<content>   This rural area has been studied by 
 the older children of Pittington      
 Junior,Mixed and Infant School. It was
 not mentioned in the original{Domesday
{Book}but nearby areas received some   
 comment in the{Boldon Book}in 1183.   
   A century ago this district was an  
 active part of the Durham Coal-field, 
 but now the land is for either        
 agricultural or residential use.      
   The school's catchment area includes
 the three villages of Low Pittington, 
 High Pittington and Littletown.       
   The villages of Pittington lie on   
 the lower slopes of a hill,           
 appropriately called Pittington Hill, 
 and one of the "Beacon" hills of old. 
 This notable hill is about four miles 
 South-East of Durham, and together    
 with the Church of St. Laurence at    
 Hallgarth, has provided the basis for 
 the children's investigations.        </content>
