		<content>   Millhouse is a remand home.During   
 the war it was used by the officers at
 Hadrian's Camp.It had been taken over 
 from the Carr family.After the war it 
 was taken over by the home office and 
 used as an approved home until 1969.  
    Nowadays it is used as a remand    
 home.The Victorian chimneys are still 
 standing and also inside the home     
 there is decoration around the        
 ceiling.This is said to be worth more 
 than the whole of the home put        
 together.It has still got some        
 medievil windows and some emblems.They
 are the rose,the portculis,the bird   
 and the acorns.The oak work was made  
 in 1922.Also there is a stream over   
 which there is a bridge built in 1921.
 At any one time there is a maximum    
 of 28 children.
