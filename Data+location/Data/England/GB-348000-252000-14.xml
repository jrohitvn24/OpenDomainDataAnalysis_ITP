		<content>{Most}of the{farms}in our area are     
{well established.}They vary in size   
 from 70acres to several hundred.Most  
 of the{farmhouses}are quite{old}but a 
 few have been built this century.Most 
 are{stone built.}The{modern}ones from 
{brick.}One{old}one is{timber framed   
 and is a{protected building.}Old farm 
 buildings are either timber framed or 
 stone.They always have wooden doors.  
 Modern ones are iron girder frames    
 with exterior cladding made from      
 metal,plastic or asbestos sheets.Most 
 farm gates are tubular metal. The     
{smaller farms}seem to have the{older, 
 cheaper{tractors. Larger farms}have   
 more{up to date}&amp; expensive{tractors. 
 The same can be said for other farm   
 machinery.If it cannot be put into a  
 barn,equipment is left outside in all 
 weathers.The better farms try to keep 
 theirs under cover and in good shape. </content>
