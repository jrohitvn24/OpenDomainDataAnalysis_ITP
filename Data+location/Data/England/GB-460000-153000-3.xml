		<content> This area provides a varied habitat   
 ranging from the urban/suburban       
 gardens and verges , the Ring Road    
 banks, chalk downlands, mixed woodland
 and a small stream valley.  The flora 
 and fauna are consequently equally as 
 varied.  Great emphasis has been put  
 on preserving this rich environment in
 both the Basingstoke Development Plan 
 and the subsequent Sherborne St. John 
 Village Plan.  It is possible to find 
 most of the common British birds and  
 many summer migrants including the    
 cuckoo.  Pheasants are reared for     
 local shoot syndicates.  The small    
 mammal kingdom includes mice, voles,  
 shrews, rats, rabbits and hares.  The 
 larger mammals are represented by     
 foxes, badgers and deer(fallow and    
 roe). The flora includes chalkland    
 regulars and wetland rarities.
