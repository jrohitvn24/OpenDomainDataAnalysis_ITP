		<content> Mr Stratton owns Manor Farm. He has an
 Apple computer for keeping accounts.He
 uses his computer for keeping a foward
 cash profile and a capital cash       
 profile.A foward cash profile is for  
 Mr stratton to estimate how much he is
 going to spend in the year ahead.A    
 capital profile shows money coming in 
 to be spent on development.At harvest 
 time the grain is put into corn bins  
 and weighed by electronic scales.In   
 the pocket of every tractor driver    
 there is an eletronic code which is   
 fed into the computer.The computer can
 pick up which field the grain has     
 come from                             
 and how much it is worth.At the end of
 every harvest M r Stratton knows how  
 much he has earned on every field.
