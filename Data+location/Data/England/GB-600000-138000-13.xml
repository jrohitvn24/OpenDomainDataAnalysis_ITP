		<content>{                                      
 This village lies on a small hill,    
 topped by the church. It is at a      
 crossroad with the A2070.             
                                       
 At the crossroad used to be the       
 village Smithy, which has now         
 transferred its skills to the motor   
 trade; also at the crossroad is the   
 village Public House.                 
                                       
 Ribbon development has taken place    
 along the main road leading to        
 Ashford, mainly bungalows, and in the 
 southerly direction more bungalows on 
 the Shipley Hill. Surrounding the     
 village are fields and odd patches of 
 woodland. The Cricket Club makes use  
 of a field near the Church and is well
 supported.
