 Copmanthorpe.He always works on his   
 own and he is the only policeman in   
 the village.For transport he has a    
 bike because he finds it easier to    
 stop and talk to the public than he   
 does in a car.If there was a serious  
 crime in the village he wouldn't be   
 able to tackle it himself,other       
 policemen would be called in to help  
 him.If it wasn't such a serious crime 
 he would be able to do it himself.He  
 isn't always at the police station he 
 is normally riding round the village  
 on his bike to check everything is    
 alright.P.C.Aspinall lives in the     
 village.Everybody in the village knows
 he can be contacted at home on the    
 phone or if he is out and about they  
 know he can be contacted by radio,
