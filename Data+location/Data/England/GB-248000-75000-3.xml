		<title>03Peter Tavy:Church and Inn</title>
		<content>  One of the oldest buildings in the   
 village is the Inn,which was built in 
 the fifteenth century.Peter Tavy also 
 has a church with a tower.This is     
 thought to have been built originally 
 in the fourteenth century in the      
 cruciform style.The church is named   
 St.Peters.As St.Peter is supposed     
 to hold the keys to heaven there is a 
 pair of crossed keys on the font      
 inside the door. The graveyard has    
 some very old graves in it,including  
 graves of children who died as young  
 as three days old.The graveyard also  
 has some new graves,some as recent as 
 1984. There is a memorial there in    
 remembrance of the people who died in 
 the Second World War.
