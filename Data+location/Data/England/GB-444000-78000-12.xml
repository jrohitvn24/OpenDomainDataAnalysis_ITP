		<title>12Roads and Footpaths</title>
		<content>{The Military Road}is the only major   
 road in this area.It was made many    
 years ago for the movement of troops  
 from end to end of the island if      
 necessary.It runs from Chale to       
 Freshwater.It is maintained by the    
 IWCC and brings people from all parts 
 to see this beautiful and as yet      
 unspoilt part of the Wight.The other  
 roads are very minor having passing   
 places and limits of 3 TONS except for
 access.There are no pavements along   
 the roads,but the numerous footpaths  
 and coastal walks are clearly signed. 
 There are lay-bys and carparks along  
 the Military Road and these may be    
 used for short walks along the cliffs.
 Sometimes there are public footpaths  
 down to the shore through chines,from 
 which walks in either direction may be
 taken.In most cases these footpaths   
 are signposted.                       </content>
