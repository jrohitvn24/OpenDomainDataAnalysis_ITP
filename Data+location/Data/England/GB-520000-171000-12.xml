		<title>12Richmond Park (1) Deer</title>
		<content>Richmond Park is a Royal Park, six     
miles from the heart of London,        
completey surrounded by suburbia and   
is an oasis of rural England and       
natural history. The Park covers 2,300 
acres, is walled by 9 miles of walls   
and has 6 gates open to traffic (5 of  
these date from Charles 1) and 4 foot  
gates. There are 7 miles of road within
the Park.                              
Two kinds of deer live in Richmond     
Park, the Red Deer and the Fallow Deer.
They rut in October and the young are  
born the following Summer. Damage is   
done to the trees by the deer browsing 
the lower branches, especially of the  
sweet chestnut.The alder, ash, birch,  
oak, willow and beech are also present.
The older oaks have been pollarded     
probably for firewood or for food for  
the deer in times of scarcity.
