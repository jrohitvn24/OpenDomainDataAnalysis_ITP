		<title>09SHOPPING IN KEMPSFORD AREA</title>
		<content>{Kempsford, Dunfield, Castle Eaton }and
{Marston Meysey}are served by a bakery 
 at{Kempsford}and Post Office/Stores at
{Kempsford}and{Castle Eaton}. There are
 no facilities at{Marston Meysey}or    
{Dunfield.}Milk is delivered daily. A  
 baker's van calls, and weekly a mobile
 wet fish van and a fish and chip van. 
 The main grocery shopping is done     
 weekly at supermarkets, generally in  
{Cirencester.}Home refigerators and    
 deep freezers make this possible and  
 has caused the demise of village      
 shops. Furniture, clothing etc. tend  
 to be purchased in{Swindon.}Available 
 public transport is limited, so       
 private transport is necessary        
 creating problems for non-drivers, the
 elderly or sick - but neighbours help.
 A community minibus operates around   
 the local villages two mornings a week
 taking shoppers to {Fairford.         </content>
