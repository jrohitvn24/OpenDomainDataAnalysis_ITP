		<content> The village church is dedicated to    
 St. Peter.  It is not of particular   
 architectural interest though it does 
 have a nice spire.                    
                                       
 As in many rural communities the      
 church is still considered an         
 important aspect of life and the      
 number of people regularly attending  
 church is quite large.  There is also 
 a Bible study class and a Sunday      
 School.                               
                                       
 The parish is linked with Harberton,  
 and it is here that the vicar lives.  
                                       
 I go to Sunday School nearly every    
 Sunday but not many of my friends go. 
 Sometimes it is quite good.
