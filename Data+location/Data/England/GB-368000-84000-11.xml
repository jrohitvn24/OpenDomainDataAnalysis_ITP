{R.TAYLOR-BUILDING  }                  
{THE WISHING WELL-SHOP. }              
 FROM THIS,WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE   
 NOT MANY PLACES IN OUR BLOCK.WE ASKED 
 EACH PERSON THREE QUESTIONS :         
{1.}HOW WOULD THEY DESCRIBE WHAT THE   
 BUSINESS DOES?                        
{2.}HOW MANY PEOPLE WORK THERE?        
{3.}DO MOST OF THEM LIVE IN UPWEY,OR IN
 THE WEYMOUTH,PORTLAND,DORCHESTER AREA?
 THE GARDEN CENTRE SAID THEY SOLD      
 PLANTS AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT,THE       
 BUILDING PLACE DID EXTENSIONS FOR     
 HOUSES,AND THE WISHING WELL SHOP SOLD 
 FOOD ,TOYS AND BOOKS.                 
 THE GARDEN CENTRE HAD 2 PEOPLE WHO    
 WORKED THERE,THEY BOTH LIVED IN       
 UPWEY.                                
                                       </content>
