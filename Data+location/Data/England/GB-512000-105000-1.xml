 1977.                                 
 Teacher,John Leitch,said,"The most    
 important thing is that children learn
 to use their eyes,and recognise what  
 is around them.The children are       
 gaining experience in                 
 mapping,recording and interviewing,as 
 well as just plain enjoyment."
