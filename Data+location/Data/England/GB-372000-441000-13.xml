		<title>13THE HERITAGE FAYRE CLITHEROE</title>
		<content>    The Heritage Fayre is a festival   
 that takes place on a Sunday, once    
 every year. All roads into the town   
 centre are closed to traffic so that  
 it is an advantage to be living near  
 the centre.                           
    Over a hundred stalls are set up by
 the roadside while in the middle      
 people are everywhere. The Fayre      
 attracts not only the local people but
 people from all over Lancashire.      
    The owners of the stalls shout,    
 ring bells, use megaphones and do all 
 kinds of things to advertise          
 themselves and to attract attention.  
    It is not all stalls though. Other 
 events are held in the castle grounds.
 This year there were trips in a hot   
 air balloon.                          
    This was Clitheroe's second annual 
 Heritage Fayre and it raised Â£25,000  
 for charities.                        </content>
