		<content> In Tackley we have a{Peace Group.}    
 They meet at 6.15 p.m.  Whatever      
 the age you can go and join them.  On 
 Thursdays they all come together and  
 think of peace - generally about Upper
 Heyford (an American Air Force base   
 about 5 miles away) and nuclear war.  
 They meet on the village green and    
 stay for a quarter of an hour.        
 The{Women's Institute}holds monthly   
 meetings.  The April meeting was held 
 at Wesley-Barrell, Witney.   The      
 minutes were read in the comfort of   
 the showroom.  We were then given a   
 tour of the factory and were able to  
 see the making of mattresses from     
 start to finish.                      
 The{Toddler Group}meets in the Village
 Hall on Tuesdays and is for children  
 under 3 and their mums.  The children 
 paint, draw and play.  In summer they 
 go on local outings.                  </content>
