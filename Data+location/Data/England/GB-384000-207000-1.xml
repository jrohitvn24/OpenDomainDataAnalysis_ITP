		<title>01Painswick Valley</title>
		<content> This rural area is part of the        
 beautiful Cotswold Country-Side.The   
 Painswick Valley,where the stream once
 turned the water-wheels of many       
 woollen mills,runs through the middle.
 The hills rise to high vantage points,
 such as Bulls Cross and Scottsquar    
 hill,where there are panoramic views. 
 Common land and Woodland here are     
 famous for wild flowers and           
 butterflies and the popular Cotswold  
 Way goes through.                     
  In this block are the villages of    
 Painswick,Slad,Edge and Pitchcombe and
 part of the development at Whiteshill.
 These are divided from each other by  
 hills and Woodland and linked by      
 winding country roads.Slad is the home
 of the famous poet and author Laurie  
 Lee.The main road between Stroud and  
 Cheltenham runs through Painswick and 
 on to the North Cotswolds.            </content>
