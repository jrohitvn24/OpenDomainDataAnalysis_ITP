		<title>12Customs of Christian Life</title>
		<content>  Christians are usually baptised as   
 babies.The child has three godparents 
 to help him live a good life until he 
 is old enough to accept the faith     
 himself.A priest uses Holy Water to   
 make the sign of the cross on the     
 child's forehead.When a teenager,the  
 christian is confirmed and becomes a  
 full member of the church.            
  Christians marry in a religious      
 ceremony.The bride wears a white dress
 and veil,and carries a bouquet of     
 flowers.She usually has friends as    
 bridesmaids who are also dressed in   
 long pretty gowns.The bride and groom 
 promise,in front of an altar,to stay  
 together for life.The priest ties     
 their hands together with his scarf,  
 and the couple exchange rings.        
  When they die,they are buried or     
 cremated.Once again the priest is     
 present to pray for them.             </content>
