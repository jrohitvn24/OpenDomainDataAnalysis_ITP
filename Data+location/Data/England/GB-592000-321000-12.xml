		<title>12Brisley/Horningtoft Houses</title>
		<content> This area includes many properties    
 which are over 100 years old.Many of  
 them have been altered and joined     
 together over the years.Some have been
 converted from barns and other farm   
 buildings.There are also a number of  
 houses and bungalows built in the last
 20 years.                             
                                       
 Most of the buildings are made of red 
 brick, but occasionally flint has been
 used.A few walls are cement rendered. 
 Roofs are normally pantiles, a few    
 have slates.                          
                                       
 Houses have mains water and           
 electricity.Sewage disposal is by     
 septic tank.
