   This farm is run by father and son. 
 The farmhouse is in the centre of     
 Elton whilst the land is to the south 
 and west of the village.              
  It is 100 acres in size. There are 50
 dairy cattle, 30 beef cattle and also 
 calves raised as replacement dairy    
 cows. There are 86 sheep and lambs on 
 grazing land in Gratton. Free-range   
 hens are kept.                        
  Some silage is cut but hay, stored in
 bales, is the main grass crop.        
  The farmer's day is from 6.00 a.m.   
 until 8.00 p.m., later during calving 
 and hay-making times.
