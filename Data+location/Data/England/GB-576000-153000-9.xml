		<title>09MAIDSTONE:HOUSING OLD PEOPLE</title>
		<content> The percentage of Maidstone's citizens
 who are elderly has recently increased
 and so has the demand for specialised 
 housing. Large detached houses have   
 been converted into old people's homes
 such as Loose Court (763531), Stone   
 Lodge (766537), and Karewell (767542).
 There has also been a demand for small
 self-contained and easily managed     
 houses suited to the elderly. A recent
 example of an estate of such houses is
 at Hillden Shaw(763538), where a full-
 time warden provides for the security 
 of the old people and organises their 
 community centre. Nearer the town     
 centre small blocks of self-contained 
 flats have been built along Waterloo  
 Street (765551). Similar flats may be 
 seen in the Spinney (769548) along    
 West Park Road, where there is also a 
 small terrace of dormer bungalows for 
 the elderly.                          </content>
