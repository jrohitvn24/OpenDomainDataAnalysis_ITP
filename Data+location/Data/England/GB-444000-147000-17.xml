		<content>   Of course the town of Whitchurch is 
 the main feature of this block        
 but the area surrounding the town is  
 also important.There are no villages  
 to be found in the area,there are only
 isolated houses or farms.             
   The farms tend to be mixed farms,   
 that is to say they undertake a       
 mixture of arable and livestock       
 farming.                              
   The nature of the farming has       
 changed in recent years,before it was 
 mainly sheep that were reared in this 
 part of Hampshire but the farms around
 Whitchurch have tended to veer away   
 from this type of farming to the more 
 diverse method.
