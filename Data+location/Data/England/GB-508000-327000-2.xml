 Brownlowe families.Before the Church  
 School was built,in 1855,for the sum  
 of Â£400,a Dame School was held        
 alongside the church organ.There were 
 once ten public houses,including The  
 Mill,The Angel and The Strawyard      
 Tavern;two bakehouses,a blacksmith's  
 forge and a workhouse.Many of the     
 cottages were thatched.In Doctor's    
 Lane there were limekilns and         
 brickyards.The Pinfold,now a recently 
 built estate of bungalows,was used for
 straying cattle and a fee had to be   
 paid to reclaim them.Among the local  
 tradesmen were a molecatcher,a carrier
 a scissor grinder and a woolgatherer!
