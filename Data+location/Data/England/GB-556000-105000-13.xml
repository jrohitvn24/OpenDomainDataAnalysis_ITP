		<title>13BRIAN'S TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> I GET UP AT 7.00am BECAUSE MY         
 BROTHER'S ALARM WAKES ME UP. IT IS    
 BATTERY POWERED. I SWITCH MY TV ON AND
 I WATCH IT FOR 10 MINUTES. THEN I GET 
 MY CLOTHES ON. I GO DOWN STAIRS AND   
 HAVE BREAKFAST. I GO TO SCHOOL AT     
 8.45am AS I HAVE TO BE AT SCHOOL BY   
 8.55. WHEN WE GET INSIDE WE START OFF 
 WITH TWO SONGS AND THREE PRAYERS ,THEN
 WE WORK.WE HAVE DINNER AT 12.00, THEN 
 WE HAVE PLAY. WHEN IT IS DRY WE CAN   
 PLAY ON THE FIELD OR THE PLAY GROUND. 
 WHEN IT IS WET, WE STAY INSIDE AND    
 READ COMICS  AND PLAY CHESS.          
 THERE ARE 3 CLASSES IN OUR SCHOOL, OF 
 37,36 AND 32 CHILDREN.THERE ARE 37 IN 
 MY CLASS. IN THE AFTERNOON WE HAVE    
 READING AND DO PROJECT WORK. SOMETIMES
 WE HAVE GAMES.                        
 AFTER SCHOOL I PLAY ON MY BIKE WITH MY
 BROTHER. I USUALLY GO TO BED AT       
 8.00pm.                               </content>
