		<title>06Rainhill Hospital.</title>
		<content> Rainhill Hospital was built as a      
 lunatic asylum for long-term patients.
 The building is in two parts:Avon wing
 and Sherdley wing. The latter has     
 newly built Scott Clinic, a secure    
 building for dangerous patients such  
 as murderers. The Benedict Clinic is  
 for the cure of alcoholics.           
 Once a patient shows signs of recovery
 they are allowed to re-enter the      
 community. They can live in flats near
 the hospital and return each day for  
 special medication. Their part of the 
 hospital is called Elton Vale. There, 
 Occupational Therepy is attempted by  
 providing instruction in life-skills  
 such as cooking, shopping and         
 handicrafts.                          
 On occasions, depressed patients kill 
 themselves in the area. Some disturbed
 patients wander into the village where
 they sometimes frighten children.     </content>
