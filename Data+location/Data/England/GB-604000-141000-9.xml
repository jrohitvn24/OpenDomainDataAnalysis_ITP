		<title>09TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>A traffic survey was undertaken on     
Wednesday 19th, Tuesday 25th June and  
Thursday 4th July 1985 to compare      
numbers of vehicles using the A20 and  
M20 in our block. The times chosen were
1040-1140 hours,0840-0940 hours and    
1405-1505 hours respectively.Tuesday   
was chosen because it is market day in 
Ashford and the figures reflect an     
increase for this reason and because   
the time coincides with the rush hour  
for commuters to Ashford to work.      
Interesting facts brought out by the   
survey were:-                          
a)cars form the bulk of vehicles.      
b)the big increase in vehicles to      
Ashford market.                        
c)the small number of coaches during   
the holiday season.                    
d)the number of ambulances from the    
hospital.                              
e)the farm products carried on tractors</content>
