		<content> The town of{Chippenham}is a stone     
 built market town. It is a natural    
 crossing point on the{River Avon.     
 King Alfred lived here,and the manor  
 of Chippenham was later held by Edward
 the Confessor.                        
 Today several stone fronted buildings 
 remain from the 18th century. In the  
 market place is the old town hall,a   
 15th century building bearing the     
 borough arms.                         
 Chippenham is an{agricultural centre  
 and an{industrial town.}The railway   
 line and the{M4 motorway}mean that it 
 is within easy reach of London and    
 South Wales.                          
 The town is growing,with many new     
 residential developments,especially on
 the Eastern side of the town along the
 A4 road towards Calne.
