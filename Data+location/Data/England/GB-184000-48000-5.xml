		<title>05ST ERME HOUSE.</title>
		<content> In St Erme there is a special home for
 autistics.Autistic people are unable  
 to communicate as other people can but
 doctors are still not sure why this   
 is.St Erme House community was set up 
 three years ago.It can house up to    
 fourteen people aged between sixteen  
 and thirty two.It is run and paid for 
 by voluntary contributions.           
 A small group of the children from St 
 Erme School went to visit the         
 community with Mrs Keam,one of our    
 teachers.We were shown around and told
 all about it.Marks and Spencers,the   
 chain stores gave a lot of money      
 towards setting up the home and the   
 day room is known as St Michaels,which
 is Marks and Spencers brand name.The  
 day room is used for many practical   
 activities.
