		<title>04THE CANAL THROUGH FLEET</title>
		<content> The{Basingstoke canal,}which flows    
 through Fleet, is undergoing extensive
{restoration work,}with probably five  
 years work to complete. Approximately 
 750 boats will be licensed to use the 
 canal this year. The pressure of      
 pedestrian use is causing a need to   
 re-surface the towpath within the next
 few years. Amongst the activities that
 local people make of the canal are    
 fishing, walking, swimming and        
 canoeing. The{danger}to local children
{of drowning}in the canal has caused   
 many people to demand a swimming pool 
 in Fleet but, up the present time, the
 local council says a pool would be too
 expensive for public money. An action 
 group, The{Hart Swimming Association,}
 was founded in 1980 and is campaigning
 for the provision of a community pool,
 jointly financed between the Hart     
 Council and other bodies.             </content>
