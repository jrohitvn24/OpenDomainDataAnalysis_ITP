		<title>02Historic Chideock Manor</title>
		<content>    Chideock Manor is situated in N.   
 Chideock and was built in 1815 by Sir 
 Humphrey Weld. Some of the materials  
 used in it's construction, including a
 magnificent 15th century Chimney      
 peice, must have come from the ruins  
 if Chideock castle.(The outline of    
 it's site can still be seen.)         
    The Manor House with it's Roman    
 Catholic church, has the main entrance
 on the Eastern side. This Eastern     
 front overlooks lawns which sweep down
 towards the river Winniford which     
 flows towards Chideock. The river has 
 been enlarged within the grounds to   
 make a lake.                          
    On the far side the land rises     
 steeply and sheep graze. This scene   
 well illustrates the pictoral setting 
 of the Manor House. Over 1,000acres of
 land are now farmed by a company which
 has Cl.H.J.G.Weld M.C. D.L.as partner.</content>
