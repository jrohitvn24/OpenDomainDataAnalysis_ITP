		<title>05PRISTON V DUNKERTON GAMES</title>
		<content> Following the Mediaeval games in 1984,
 the 1985 annual match between Priston 
 and Dunkerton took the form of Deck   
 Games on the Titanic held in the      
 meadow by Cam brook. As well as plenty
 of water; spectators in period dress  
 and cucumber sandwiches for tea added 
 to the atmosphere. Rules of the games 
 take account of local conditions so   
 when one of the 'deck hockey' goals   
 is larger than the other and downhill,
 the goalie is armed with a hose to    
 compensate. Games varied from Tug o'  
 War to the less well known 'Uckers'   
 which is thought to be a life size    
 version of Ludo. Deck Quoits and a    
 shooting match added to the variety.  
 Games are entered into without thought
 for life or limb, and indeed the      
 captain of the Priston ladies hockey  
 team ended in hospital, fortunately   
 with nothing worse than six stitches. </content>
