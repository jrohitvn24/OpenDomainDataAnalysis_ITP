 Two Bridges is located centrally in   
 the Dartmoor National Park and        
 although the land has to support the  
 local community, it is also in great  
 demand for recreational use, a de     
 facto right of access extending across
 the whole of the high moor.           
                                       
 The are is mainly used for hiking,    
 rambling and camping; also to a lesser
 extent for the study of natural       
 history and both archeology and       
 industrial archeology.                
                                       
 The soil is too poor to support arable
 farming, the land being of great      
 importance for the summer grazing of  
 sheep, cattle and ponies.
