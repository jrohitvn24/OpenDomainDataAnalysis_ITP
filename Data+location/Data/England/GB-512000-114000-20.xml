		<content>    We asked forty-nine children from  
 the two junior classes in our school  
 where they were going for their       
 holiday this year. Fourteen were going
 to the West Country (Cornwall and     
 Devon), 3 to Wales, 2 to Scotland, 8  
 in the South of England, 12 were going
 abroad and the other ten were not     
 going away this year.                 
    We then asked the children about   
 the countries they have visited abroad
 sixteen have been to France, 16 to    
 Spain, 2 to Greece, 2 to Belgium, 2 to
 Ireland, 2 to Africa, 2 to Holland and
 one each to Austria, Italy and        
 Switzerland.                          
    {* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *}    
 The children of Ashington C.E. School 
 (Yellow Class) wrote much of the      
 accompanying material with teachers   
 Mrs Carter and Mr Breach and much help
 from the Ashington Women's Institute. </content>
