		<content> In our area there are three main      
 roads.Scraptoft Lane was probably     
 built in the Bronze Age along an      
 ancient ridgeway leading from Stamford
 to Leicester.Now it leads into Covert 
 Lane once the old toll road,but now   
 a quiet country lane.Uppingham Road   
 (A47) is now the major route and joins
 the Great North Road near             
 Peterborough.Station Road connects the
 two.All these roads are busy.         
 We did a traffic census on the A47 and
 I made a graph showing how many       
 vehicles used the road.In one hour 249
 cars,45 vans,48 lorries,6 motor bikes,
 4 caravans,2 buses 1 ambulance,1      
 bulldozer and 1 bike left town,a total
 of 358.On Scraptoft Lane I counted 114
 cars,18 vans,9 lorries,6 buses,1      
 ambulance and 10 bikes making 158 in  
 all.The A47 was nearly twice as busy.
