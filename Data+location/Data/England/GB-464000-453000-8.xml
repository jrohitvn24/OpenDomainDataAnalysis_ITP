		<content> Stockton on Forest is 4 miles from    
 York. There is a bus route through    
 Stockton to Scarborough.              
 Buses stop 4 times a day.The fare     
 to York is 70p for Adults 35p         
 for children.                         
      There are no rivers near         
 Stockton only a few becks which       
 are not very wide.                    
 The nearest river is the Derwent at   
 Stamford Bridge.                      
     There was a railway here until    
  1962 but it was closed down because  
  not enough people used it.It went    
  from York to Hull.                   
      The main road from York to Scar- 
 borough cuts through our block (A64). 
 There is a very large roundabout on it
 and work has recently started to      
 extend the York by pass from it.
