		<title>03EDGEFIELD PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The most interesting building in      
 Edgefield is the Church which was     
 originally built half a mile away,    
 where the thirteenth century octagonal
 tower still stands. When Canon Marcon 
 became Rector in 1875 he found the old
 church in bad repair and decided to   
 move it nearer to his parishioners.   
 Most of the materials of the old      
 building were re-used: the stones were
 marked so that they could be replaced 
 correctly, but the old tower with 14th
 century belfry was left standing. The 
 new church was consecrated in 1884.   
 The octagonal font has a rare 13th    
 century bowl.The screen in the south  
 aisle has painted panels dated 1526,  
 showing the donors with their seven   
 sons and six daughters.The new tower  
 was built in 1907. There are 18th     
 century memorial tablets and one to   
 Canon Marcon who died in 1937.        </content>
