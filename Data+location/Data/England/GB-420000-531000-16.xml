		<content> Her father,a local NUM official at the
 time lost his post over this incident.
 He it was who aroused her interest in 
 politics; she joined the Labour Party 
 &amp; helped with the local Co-op. He was 
 one of several instrumental in opening
 the Workingmen's Club in the 20's, one
 of the few facilities open in Newfield
 Mrs Tulip regrets the closing of the  
 mines, yet would not allow her son to 
 work underground. "Too dangerous", she
 said,"he took up a trade". He is still
 at home but before retiring was forced
 to seek employment in Spennymoor.     
 In her youth Mrs Tulip would walk to  
 Willington, crossing the R.Wear by the
 footbridge, to attend dances and the  
 cinema- once popular, now closed. She 
 is still active in the only remaining 
 chapel, even the school has closed.The
 village, no longer the vital community
 she remembers, is still in her blood. </content>
