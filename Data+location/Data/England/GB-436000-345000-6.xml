		<content> The nearest centres of public         
 entertainment are Derby and           
 Nottingham, but only a small          
 proportion of our area's population   
 visit these centres' theatres, cinemas
 or concert_halls, partly due to the   
 preference for television and videos, 
 a development which brought about the 
 closure of the local cinemas in       
 Belper, Ripley and Heanor. Families   
 going out in the evenings are more    
 likely to go to the local Miners'     
 Welfare or other social club, or just 
 to an ordinary public house. Watching 
 or playing sports of various sorts has
 increased in popularity (see separate 
 pages on{Belper Sports Centre}). The  
 young are attrated to youth clubs and 
 discos provided in the area.
