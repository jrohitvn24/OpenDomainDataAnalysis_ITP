		<title>13LAMLASH PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content>    The building of Lamlash Primary    
 School was completed in 1981 and now  
 serves as one of the seven primary    
 schools on the island.The attendance  
 is made up of 97 pupils and 4         
 teachers.                             
    The building is 1 storey semi- open
 plan,and due to the architectural work
 which was put into its design, it won 
 an award.                             
    The pupils come from as far as     
 three miles away and this means that  
 local buses and taxi services have to 
 be provided for the pupils.           
    Before the building was completed  
 the pupils were situated in some of   
 the high school huts,being separated  
 from each other considerably.Now with 
 their semi-open classrooms all joined 
 together teaching is much easier.
