		<title>16The York Outer Ring Road</title>
		<content> The York outer Relief road is being   
 built to join the existing A64        
 south-west of the city It is to be a  
 single carriage road but with land    
 purchased on either side to convert it
 later to a dual carriage-way The      
 by-pass is to cross the river between 
 Clifton and Skelton and a roundabout  
 is being built at Rawcliffe to link   
 with the busy Shipton road into       
 Clifton and York. The by-pass         
 continues across Clifton airfield and 
 Clifton Moor.Work is at present on    
 time and due for completion at the end
 of 1986.Local farmers will have       
 problems when their land is divided by
 the new road. Mr Leaf a farmer at     
 Clifton Gate hopes to solve this      
 problem by crossing with animals and  
 machinery very early in the morning.He
 welcomes the new road.
