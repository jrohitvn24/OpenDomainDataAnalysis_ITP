Around the hall of our school are 2    
patios.One has a fish pond and the     
other has a pond for frogs.We have 2   
playgrounds &amp; a lovely field with 3    
climbing frames,a play house,a fort and
a boat.We only had a few trees so we   
planted a little woodland.We have some 
gardens &amp; an outside swimming pool     
which we use in the summer.In our class
we have pets like gerbils &amp; guinea pigs
&amp; we have tadpoles in an aquarium and  
eggs in our incubator.Hopefully,soon we
might have some ducklings and goslings.
We have a special lamb called Helen    
which we saw born on a farm.At our     
school we do lots of interesting work &amp;
have a lot of fun!
