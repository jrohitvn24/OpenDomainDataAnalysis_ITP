		<title>06FARMING AT BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   Most of our Domesday block is       
 farmland.  We have at least thirty    
 farms on our block.  They have cattle,
 sheep and crops.  There are wide local
 variations in climate: frost and snow 
 occur, but they are very short-lived. 
 The less sheltered land is used for   
 arable and dairy farming.  Dairy      
 farming is changing from milk         
 production to beef production as a    
 result of the E.E.C. quotas.  The main
 breed are Friesians and there is a    
 regular milk tanker.                  
   Several farmers have sheep and there
 were signs of pig-farming.  Many      
 people raise their own chickens, geese
 and ducks.  A fair proportion of the  
 fields are arable, but they are used  
 for potatoes, barley and kale, mainly 
 for cattle feed, although some of the 
 potatoes are sold in Plymouth to      
 green-grocers and fish and chip shops.</content>
