		<content> There is an annual church fete at     
 Cotleigh,the proceeds of which go to  
 church and village hall funds.A recent
 innovation is a car treasure hunt     
 taking place on a summer evening.     
 During winter there are discos in the 
 village hall which has a licenced     
 bar.Next to the hall is a recreation  
 ground with swings and a slide.A point
 to_point meeting took place this year 
 for the first time.In Stockland parish
 people attend Stockland Fair and other
 local entertainments such as          
 occasional concerts,plays,musical     
 evenings and the Harvest Supper.
