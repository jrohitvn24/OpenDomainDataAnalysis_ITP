		<content>                                       
 We chatted with John Bourne of Home   
 Farm.Mr Bourne is 82 yrs. old and     
 sleeps in the bedroom where he was    
 born. He went to our school and       
 remembers the gallery where the       
 infants sat.In his youth there were   
 only four cars in Burghill and one    
 phone at the P.O. Roads were not      
 tarred and heaps of stones were kept  
 for repairs. Electricity came in      
 1926/7, provided by City of Hereford  
 Electricity Dept. He remembered the   
 Misses Woodhouse who lived at the     
 Court. Boys would raise their hats to 
 them and girls curtsied. He knew the  
 man who murdered them in 1926! He has 
 seen many changes in the size of      
 Burghill and also changes in          
 farming.He remembers when many more   
 people worked on the land. He felt    
 life was hard but happier then.       </content>
