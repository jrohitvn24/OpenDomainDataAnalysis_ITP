		<content>{Mr. Adams}moved here because Sutton   
 has many shops and isn't very busy.   
 He lived in Lincoln for 4 years and   
 has been in Sutton for 2 years.He said
 Sutton is different because it is     
 smaller and not so busy.There were    
 bigger schools and shops where he used
 to live.His hobby is C.B.radios.{Mr   
{Adams}likes the peace and quiet       
 of Sutton but he doesn't like the jobs
 that there are.He also said that he   
 may return to Lincoln.{
