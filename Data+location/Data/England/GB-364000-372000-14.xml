		<content> THE RIVER WEAVER  AND THE RIVER DANE  
 JOIN IN THE CENTRE OF THIS AREA AND   
 WITH CASTLE HILL ENJOYING A VEIW OVER 
 THE WHOLE AREA IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN   
 IDEAL SETTING FOR A SETTLEMENT.       
 SINCE THEN THE AREA HAS BEEN          
 DEVELOPED AND THE LANDSCAPE ALTERED TO
 A GREATER EXTENT.                     
 MAN HAS BEEN THE MAJOR CAUSE OF THE   
 CHANGES.THE SALT AND MORE RECENTLY THE
 CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES HAVE  CHANGED THE 
 LANDSCAPE FROM ONE OF FLAT CHESHIRE   
 PLAINS TO ONE OF WASTE AREAS OF LIME  
 AND COLLAPSED BRINE PITS WHICH HAVE   
 FILLED WITH WATER TO FORM PONDS OR    
 MERES.MANY OF THESE CHANGES IN THE    
 LAND HAVE BEEN IMPROVED AND USED      
 RECENTLY. THE MERES AND PONDS ARE USED
 FOR RECREATION PURPOSES WHILE THE     
 FLASHES OR LIME BEDS ARE BEING FILLED 
 BY WASTE PRODUCTS.HOPEFULLY THEY WILL 
 FORM PART OF CHESHIRES BEAUTIFUL LAND.</content>
