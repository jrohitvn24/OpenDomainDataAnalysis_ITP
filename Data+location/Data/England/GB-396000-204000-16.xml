		<content>   Both of the churches are very old,  
 dating from Saxon times, before the   
 Norman Conquest.                      
    The Church of the Holy Rood,       
 Daglingworth, has 3 Late Saxon        
 limestone sculptures set in the       
 interior walls, the most remarkable   
 one being a plaque with a picture of  
 the Crucifixion. Outside the church a 
 Saxon Crucifix and Sundial can be     
 seen. Many tourists visit this        
 interesting church which can seat     
 about l4O. Services are held here     
 every Sunday.                         
    The Church of St. Michael is a tiny
 Saxon church with l7th Century        
 panelled bow pews for about 45 people.
 It has a saddle-back tower and crypt  
 below the chancel. Family services in 
 which children take part are held here
 once a month.                         
                                       </content>
