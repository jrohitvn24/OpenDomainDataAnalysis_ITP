		<title>07A LOCAL FARM</title>
		<content> Bells Forstal farm is owned by Mr     
 Roger Scutt. The farm covers 450      
 acres. Most of the land is used for   
 growing crops. This year Mr Scutt has 
 barley (100 acres), wheat (300 acres),
 grass (35 acres),and oats (15 acres). 
   He also owns 200 cattle, of which   
 140 are dairy cows, and 100 sheep.    
 These are kept on fields outside the  
 Throwley area, but do come to the farm
 for the winter months.                
   The farm has 10 tractors, 2 combine 
 harvesters, a forklift truck and lots 
 of accessories such as cultivators    
 sprayers and trailors. Mr Scutt       
 employs 6 workers.                    
   The greatest problems are planning  
 work because of the weather,          
 maintaining machinery, and regular    
 spraying against weeds pests and fungi
   It costs about half a million pounds
 a year to run the farm.               </content>
