		<title>16DALLAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Dallam was established in September   
 1984,having been set up as a voluntary
 aided comprehensive and co_educational
 school to meet the needs,interests and
 abilities of all its pupils between   
 the ages of 11 and 19.Formed from     
 Heversham Grammar School and          
 Milnthorpe Community College,the new  
 school has a most promising and       
 exciting future:merging the           
 reputations,staffs and facilities of a
 long established grammar school and a 
 thriving community college provided   
 the best elements for a school which  
 is to serve the purposes and          
 challenges that face education in the 
 1980's and far beyond.As an added     
 strength,the boarding tradition of    
 Heversham continues,bringing in pupils
 from beyond our catchment area and    
 thereby enlarging the horizons and    
 experiences of all at the school.     </content>
