		<title>03The Policing of Alderney II</title>
		<content>  People who have done something wrong 
 are put in the jail until they are put
 before the court.After that he does or
 goes wherever the court says.Most     
 people who commit crimes go to        
 Guernsey.The worst crime that has been
 committed in Alderney in 1985 has been
 the possession of narcotics(drugs).The
 largest fine from the Alderney court  
 is Â£100 on one charge.The vehicle that
 they use is a Landrover (AY999-AY     
 being the registration letters        
 denoting Alderney).There are about    
 1950 motor vehicles on Alderney.The   
 licensing hours permitted are ,summer 
 1000-0100 hours;winter 1000-2400 hours
 with shorter hours on Sundays.The     
 police job is very much that of       
 "community policing" as most people on
 the island know each other.
