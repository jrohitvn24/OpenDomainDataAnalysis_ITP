		<title>09PURBROOK SHEEPWASH FARM</title>
		<content> In our square is{SHEEPWASH FARM.} It  
 is quite near Purbrook Heath.  We     
 visited and asked the farmer          
 questions.  We found out that it was a
 family farm.  The primary land cover  
 is grassland sown with rye seeds.  We 
 walked through some fields where they 
 were growing Barley and Winter Wheat. 
 The farm also has animals.  They have 
 Jersey cos called "PURWICKS".  The PUR
 stands for Purbrook and the WICK for  
 Southwick.  The farm produces cream   
 which is sold locally.  They have many
 pigs which they keep at Closewood     
 north of the farm.  Ducks live  by the
 stream which sometimes gets polluted  
 by industrial waste from              
 Waterlooville.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
