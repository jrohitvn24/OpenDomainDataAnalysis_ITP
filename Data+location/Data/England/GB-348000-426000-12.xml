		<content>Most people in our D-block who are over
18 own a driver's licence,hardly anyone
owns a motor bike.99% of families own a
car .Most people use a train for long  
distances only,except when they go on  
holiday in this country;when they use  
their car.The most used type of        
{transport} in our D-block is the car. 
Most adults who were asked did not own 
a bicycle ;they preferred walking or   
driving.                               
Most of the cars in our area are Fords 
or British Leyland.                    
Liverpool Road is the biggest and      
busiest road running through our       
D-block.Traffic travels from Preston   
and Leyland to Southport,Black         
pool and Liverpool.Not many people     
use buses except those going to town   
and school children.There are no taxi  
stands the nearest one being at the    
railway station in Preston.            </content>
