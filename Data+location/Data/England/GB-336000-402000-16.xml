		<content>{Richard}"On a Saturday I usually get  
 up at about 7.30 to watch breakfast   
 television.I eat my breakfast at about
 8.15 and then put on my tracksuit on.I
 leave the house at 9.30 and call for  
 my friends who also play for the cubs 
 football team.If we have a home match 
 we play on the school field,if its an 
 away match we travel by car.I have my 
 lunch at 1.00 and then I go to        
 Goodison Park with my dad to watch    
 Everton play.After I have had my tea I
 usually watch television,especially   
 the football.
