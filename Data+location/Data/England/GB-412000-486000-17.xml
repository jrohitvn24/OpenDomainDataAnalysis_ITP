		<title>17Employment: The Farrier.</title>
		<content> ' A typical day starts at 8am. when I 
 start work &amp; load my car with the     
 shoes I need for the day's work. I    
 keep the names of all the horses on a 
 rota system so that I know which are  
 likely to need shoeing. I try to see  
 the trainer to discuss the type of    
 shoe required eg. light weight shoes  
 for racing or longer lasting mild     
 steel exercise shoes. I shoe a horse  
 every month as horses feet are growing
 all the time. On average I shoe 40    
 horses every week as well as make the 
 shoes.Sometimes I get knocked over &amp; I
 often get bitten. I enjoy my work     
 because to shoe a horse is always a   
 challenge as you are working with     
 living tissue and I get satisfaction  
 in seeing a good job done. I have been
 a farrier for 24 yrs. I was an        
 apprentice for 5 years.'
