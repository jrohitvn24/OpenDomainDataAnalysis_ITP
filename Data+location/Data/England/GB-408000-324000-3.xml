		<title>03THE BUTTERCROSS</title>
		<content> The Buttercross is in the centre of   
 the village and was built in the      
 1600's. It is a hexagonal building    
 made of oak and roofed with slates.It 
 was used as a centre for the Market   
 until the 1800's and was so named     
 because {butter}was originally sold   
 there.It was also the centre of the   
 market which was held in the village  
 and where cattle and farm produce were
 sold. The market reached from the     
 Bottom o Bagot Stret all the way to   
 the Lichfield Road.At the side of the 
 Buttercross there were the village    
 stocks which are occasionally returned
 to the site.(usually during Fete day)
