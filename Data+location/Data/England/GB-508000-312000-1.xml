		<title>01The village blacksmith.(1)</title>
		<content> This is a truly contented man. He has 
 carried on the tradition of an ancient
 craft lovingly for the last 25 years  
 or so,in the{village.}He is the only  
 Master{Blacksmith}in the county, and  
 his services are in demand over a     
 radius of 50 miles. 75% of his        
 business requires him to travel. 25%  
 comes to him at his forge. He is      
 self-employed. He prefers the{farrier 
{side of his}work but still undertakes 
 some of the traditional blacksmith    
 jobs e.g. flower pedestals;hanging    
 baskets;barackets;boot-scrapers;shafts
 on garden tools;picking safes(but only
 when asked by the owner!)             
 His business is pretty constant       
 throughout the year. In the winter he 
 is busy because of local hunts, in the
 summer children's ponies take up more 
 of his time.
