 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL  OF FARMING IN  
 OUR AREA; IN FACT NEARLY ALL OUR AREA 
 IS MADE UP OF FARMS.WE HAVE MOST SORTS
 OF FARMING INCLUDING DAIRY FARMING,   
 SHEEP FARMING, BEEF FARMING AND ARABLE
 FARMING.THE BIGGEST FARM IS A MIXED   
 FARM OWNED BY THE NEARBY LORD         
 WANDSWORTH COLLEGE.OUTSIDE OF OUR     
 SCHOOL WE HAVE A GREAT BIG FIELD AND  
 IT IS FULL OF BLACK AND WHITE FREISAN 
 COWS, THEY ARE DAIRY COWS. ACROSS THE 
 OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IS A HUGE FIELD
 WHERE BARLEY IS BEING GROWN AND UNTIL 
 RECENTLY, THE AREA TO THE WEST OF OUR 
 BLOCK WAS GIVEN OVER ALMOST COMPLETELY
 TO THE REARING OF LAMBS. THIS YEAR    
 THERE WERE SEVERAL LARGE FIELDS WHERE 
 YELLOW OILSEED RAPE WAS GROWN.
