		<content> The park land behind the old Manor    
 House comprises 29 acres and still    
 clearly shows the old ridge and furrow
 style of farming dating back to the   
 Normans.  The furrows run across the  
 field both dividing the ridges and    
 draining the ground.  The water from  
 them ran into a mill race.  Some      
 evidence of this mill race is still to
 be seen.  Archeologists have          
 discovered the remains of an earlier  
 group of plaster and wood houses in   
 the park and a short distance away    
 stood a Roman Villa and shards of     
 pottery have been discovered.  In the 
 park are a herd of cattle.  The trees,
 all planted by the ancestors of Mr.   
 Wright are a mixture of evergreens and
 decidous some them very old and the   
 trunks of a wide girth.  The walls    
 surrounding the park were made from   
 the stone from the old farm yard.     </content>
