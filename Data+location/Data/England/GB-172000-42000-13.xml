		<content> The bats usually live in horizontal   
 galleries leading of from the main    
 shaft. The bat population has dropped 
 by 98% since 1950 and there was       
 thought to be about 200 pairs left in{
{Cornwall.}There were nearly 200 pairs 
 of Horseshoe bats found living in     
 Wheal Buttry near{Bissoe.}The bats    
 leave the shaft in a spiralling       
 flight. A special capping was made to 
 stop cattle from falling in, to warn  
 humans of the shaft and let the bats  
 spiral out. The cover and iron framing
 have to be 75cm to leave room for the 
 bats to spiral out. The bat flaps     
 cannot be painted because bats don't  
 like paint so they use special Iron   
 bars. There are 3 bat flaps at{       
{Creegbrawse}near the School.
