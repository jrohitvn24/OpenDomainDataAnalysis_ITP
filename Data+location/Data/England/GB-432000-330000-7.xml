		<title>07STENSON MARINA</title>
		<content> Stenson Marina is ten years old.It    
 covers an acre exactly.It is five to  
 eight feet deep.The bottom of the     
 Marina is never cleaned but once a    
 month the sides are.The Marina was Sir
 Laurence Sanders father's idea.It took
 two years to build.It was filled with 
 the River Trent water.It took three   
 weeks to fill.The repair shed is ten  
 metres by four metres and two metres  
 high.It's seventeen months old.In the 
 Marina there's room for 126 boats.It's
 fifty pounds per person to live on a  
 boat at the Marina for a week.They    
 have no toilet,which is illegal.There 
 are sometimes vandals.There are 12    
 boats owned by the Marina which are   
 hired out.There's a lot of pollution  
 in the Marina because the sewage pipes
 are near the surface and are leaking. 
 There are no plans to make the Marina 
 bigger.By Sarah,Beth,Sharon,Catherine.</content>
