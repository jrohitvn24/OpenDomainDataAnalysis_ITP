		<content> The{South Downs}are made of chalk and 
 covered with a thin layer of soil. At 
 the bottom{Kingley Vale}there is a    
 small chalk pit to show the depth of  
 soil. We could see about 30 cm. of    
 soil that had been naturally eroded   
 from the top of the hill thousands of 
 years ago . This soil provides rich   
 pasture for grazing eg.at West Stoke  
 Farm.                                 
 At the top of the hill we found a     
 fence that separated the grass covered
 Downs from a wheat field. Here we saw 
 evidence of modern day erosion. We    
 noticed wheat growing on exposed      
 chalk. The topsoil had been washed or 
 blown away.
