		<content> The few very old houses in Cookridge  
 are over two hundred years old. They  
 are made of stone with slate roofs.   
 The farmhouse is now an inn, the old  
 smithy a house and the gamekeeper's   
 cottage a house. The 18th century     
 Cookridge Hall is now a nursing home. 
 In the 1920's a few houses were built 
 along the existing roads. Cookridge   
 began to expand in 1952 when new      
 estates were built, first at Tinshill,
 where the different kinds of houses   
 ranged from 3 storey flats to private 
 bungalows and houses. In 1957 the     
 Moseley Woods were built. The biggest 
 new estate, Holt Park, was built in   
 1973. It consists of houses, shops, a 
 library and a sports centre. The      
 newest houses were built at Cookridge 
 Towers in 1982. These are very modern,
 smaller and brighter looking because  
 they are made of yellow bricks.       </content>
