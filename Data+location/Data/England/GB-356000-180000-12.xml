		<content>   On my birthday I play lots of games 
 like musical bumps, musical statues   
 and pass the parcel. We have food like
 crisps, cakes, chocolate bisciuts and 
 peanuts. When we have eaten all the   
 food everyone sings "Happy birthday". 
 We all wear our best clothes and shoes
 and have brushed hair.                
   I get lots of presents. I like all  
 the presents. I like writing to thank 
 people for the presents, and inviting 
 people round to stay for the night.   
 Sometimes I get Barbie and Sindy      
 Dolls, and clothes for them.          
   I like my  parties, they are good   
 fun. I invite all my friends. I like  
 to have a cake in the shape of a bunny
 rabbit, G, or a Victoria Plum shape,  
 with a ballet dancer on the top and   
 happy birthday. My birthday is on the 
 24th of July.
