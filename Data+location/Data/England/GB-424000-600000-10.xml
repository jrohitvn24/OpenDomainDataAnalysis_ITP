		<content>{The}skeleton of industry              
     Around us lies with scars,        
     And the once thriving human race  
     Is gradually being forgotten.     
     Taken is the ploughman's horse,   
     Taken are the farms,              
     And all of this has been replaced 
     By speedy motor cars.             
{ By}tractors, modern housing estates, 
     Milking machines for churns,      
     And oh! for the love of the       
     Countryside                       
     How many people yearn?            
     A peaceful beach, a tranquil place
     Is just for local folk;           
     But the technology of the '80's   
     With computers it has spoke.      
{The}slowness of the country folk      
     Has been speeded up.              
     As the 'Chevington Lady' digs     
     And the protests carry on,        
     And the power station will come.  </content>
