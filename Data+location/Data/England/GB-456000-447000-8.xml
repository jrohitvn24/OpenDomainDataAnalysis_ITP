		<content> The residents of Woodthorpe generally 
 enjoy living in its peaceful          
 atmosphere. In the Spring and Summer  
 seasons the area is at its best       
 with every street and house having a  
 wide variety of colour from trees and 
 shrubs. Late Spring brings out the    
 blossom on the trees producing        
 beautiful colour and sweet smelling   
 perfume. The gardens of the houses    
 have a wonderful selection of almost  
 every cultivated flower that will grow
 in the area. It truly lives up to its 
 name of a garden village. The         
 cultivation of the gardens is a source
 of pride and they are well looked     
 after.It is a neat, healthy and       
 pleasing environment in which to live.
