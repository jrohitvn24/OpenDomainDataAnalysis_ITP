		<title>19WESTON MAY FAIR</title>
		<content> Each year on the first Saturday in May
 Weston has a May Fair.We have stalls  
 for "White Elephant"and tombola.Next  
 the children of Weston dance.The fair 
 is held for evrybody in the church    
 hall.This year which is 1985 we are   
 presenting a pantomine with singing   
 and dancing.We have been giving these 
 shows for four years but before we    
 just had stalls.We always have do lots
 sorting out before the day.We wear    
 different costumes so we have to get  
 changed all the time but it isn't very
 easy because there is only a little   
 stage.On the stalls we have refresh-  
 ments and lots of jumble and other    
 things.We raise about two hundred     
 pounds each year which we use for the 
 church fund.Nearly all of Weston vill-
 age come but last year not many dads  
 came was cup final day.I hope success 
 this year like the other years.       </content>
