		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN CLOPHILL</title>
		<content>  There are not a great many people    
 employed in{Clophill}itself. Most of  
 the wage-earners commute to the local 
 towns. We do however have several     
 small businesses apart from{farming.  
  The{timberyard}in Old Silsoe Road    
 makes fences, pallets, sheds and other
 things to order.                      
  The shop in the former Chapel next   
 door sells all kinds of{animal feed.  
  Hilltop Farm has a pool for{swimming 
{lessons.                              
  We took a random survey of 100 homes 
 &amp; had 66 replies which showed that of 
 our population                        
 MEN  15% WOMEN 26 % work in Clophill  
      35%        4\%         Luton     
       9%        6 %         Bedford
