		<title>17THE BLOOD STAINED STEPS</title>
		<content> During the Civil War some Roundheads  
 came to Kirkburton to take the Vicar, 
 Gamaliel Whitaker to Manchester       
 because he was a Royalist. They       
 searched the vicarage for him. They   
 found him and searched the house      
 again for anyone else including Hester
 Whitaker, the vicars wife, but didn't 
 find anyone. As they were taking Mr   
 Whitaker away, a boy thought he heard 
 something behind him. He thought that 
 if he shot whatever it was he may be  
 praised as a hero. He spun round and  
 pulled the trigger. There was a flash,
 bang and a dead woman lying on the    
 vicarage steps with blood pouring from
 her head. It was Hester, Gamaliels    
 wife. People say that blood can still 
 be seen on the steps. In 1954 when the
 vicarage was altered, human bones     
 were found and taken to Leeds. They   
 were identified as female bones.      </content>
