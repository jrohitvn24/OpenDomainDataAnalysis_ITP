		<content>{Traffic Congestion in S.E. Ilford.    
   Like many urban areas, we suffer    
 considerably from this especially     
 during morning and afternoon peak     
 periods. In adition, as most housing  
 here was built prior to World War II, 
 there is{anadequate provision for cars
 in residential areas. Thus on-street  
 parking combined with{narrow streets  
 causes frequent problems.             
   Heavy rush hour traffic often causes
{long delays at intersections}along the
 A12 and the High Road. Attempts have  
 been made to improve the flow along   
 some local routes by mini-roundabouts:
{there is major road re-development}in 
 the centre of Ilford but much more    
 needs to be done. More restricted     
 street parking and more car parks,    
 with redirected traffic flows, could  
 ease the problem in many locations.
