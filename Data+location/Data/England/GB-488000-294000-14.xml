		<title>14A GRETTON CHURCHWARDEN</title>
		<content>   Alan Wheeler is a Churchwarden at   
the Gretton Parish Church. He was asked
during an interview to give an account 
of the way he spends a typical Sunday. 
He said that before morning service in 
Church, it is his duty to get out the  
hymn books, light the candles, put up  
the hymn numbers, check the heating if 
required and switch on the lights. When
the people begin to arrive, Alan       
welcomes them at the door. It is also  
his duty to take the collection, count 
it after the service, record it and    
lock it away in the safe. The heating  
and lights are then switched off.      
   On his way home Alan collects his   
Sunday paper. During the afternoon his 
activities can include cleaning the    
car,cutting the lawn, gardening or     
going out with his wife and two        
sons. After tea he possibly has to     
attend another service.                </content>
