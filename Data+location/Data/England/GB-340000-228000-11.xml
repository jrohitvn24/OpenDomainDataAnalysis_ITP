		<title>11FARMING THE FLATLANDS</title>
		<content> The{flatlands}in the centre of our    
 area are used mainly for{arable       
{farming,}the largest unit being at    
{Howton Court.}The soil is mostly heavy
 clay, but with the use of modern,     
 sophisticated machinery and the       
 careful application of{fertilizers}and
 sprays, good crops can be harvested. A
 four year{crop rotation}system is     
 normally used: oil seed rape, wheat   
 for milling, wheat for animal feed,   
 and barley.                           
 Some smaller fields have had the      
 dividing hedges removed to create     
 larger units of 25-30 acres which are 
 more suited to the large modern       
 tractors and ploughs.                 
 Two men can now do the work that      
 required at least ten employees thirty
 years ago.The straw is sold standing  
 to local stockfarmers and the stubble 
 is ploughed back into the land.       </content>
