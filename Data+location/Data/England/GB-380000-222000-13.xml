		<content>GENERAL DESCRIPTION                    
 Almost the whole of the block is agri-
cultural land but the use to which it  
is put varies with the height. The low 
fields near the River Severn are marshy
and are regularly flooded. They are    
unsuitable for crops and are used as   
cattle or sheep pasture. The higher    
ground is used for cereals, orchards or
beans. There is woodland on the steeper
parts of Woolridge.                    
We interviewed many farmers and were   
surprised by the differences between   
the farms. They all looked alike to us!
Most farms are run with very few lab-  
ourers, machines have replaced people. 
One or two have changed from dairy to  
beef cattle as less work is involved.  
Some farms have combined to form more  
efficient units. One landowner has now 
stopped farming and just rents fields  
to other farmers.                      </content>
