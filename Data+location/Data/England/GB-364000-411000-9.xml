		<content> The N.E. boundary of Horwich is       
 nowadays where the Greater Manchester 
 conurbation finally gives way to Green
 belt and open country.It has always   
 been on the fringe of things.         
 The oldest part of Horwich was        
 probably near the Parish Church.The   
 most significant economic activity    
 apart from farming would be to do with
 textiles.Previous to the Industrial   
 Revolution woolens were made at home  
 from the carding,spinning,weaving to  
 fulling and bleaching.                
 The old word for bleacher was         
 "crofter".The soft water from the     
 hillside would be used.Pub names such 
 as "Jolly Crofters" hint at this.     
 In the 19th.century many of the larger
 mills,such as Wallsaches were         
 bleachers.
