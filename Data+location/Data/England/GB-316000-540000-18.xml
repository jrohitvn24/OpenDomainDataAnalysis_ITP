		<title>18ALL HALLOWS CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The church at Mealsgate is dedicated
 to All Hallows. It was built in       
 1898-9. It is built of stone in the   
 Norman style. There is a small        
 chancel, a nave, south porch, small   
 vestry and a tower at the west end    
 which contains two bells. There is    
 seating for 112 people.               
   Attached to the church is a mortuary
 chapel built by George Moore. There is
 a graveyard surrounding the church,   
 still in use, and in the graveyard a  
 stone cross as a war memorial to the  
 men who died in the 1914-18 war.      
   The parish no longer supports its   
 own vicar, but shares with St.        
 Michael's at Torpenhow. Rev. David    
 Scott is also a noted poet and writer.
   The vicarage, opposite the church,  
 was sold and is now a private         
 residence.                            
                                       </content>
