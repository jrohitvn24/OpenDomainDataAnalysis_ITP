		<title>04The canal</title>
		<content>    When the canal was built it        
 stretched from{Nottingham to Grantham.
 It was opened in 1797. It took four   
 years to build and cost Â£100,000. The 
 main use for the{Grantham Canal}was to
 transport coal and night soil from    
 Nottingham to Grantham and farm       
 products were brought from there back 
 to Nottingham. The canal prospered for
 fifty years until the coming of the   
 railways.                             
    Today the canal is not used but it 
 is being restored by the{Grantham     
{Canal Preservation Society.}Now you   
 can find all of the common wild       
 flowers of Britain growing along its  
 banks. Some sections can now be used  
 again by small craft. Water birds and 
 other wildlife live by it.
