  My aircraft design is designed for   
 comfort and elegance,also speed and   
 economics.It is powered by three      
 rectangular shaped thrusters at the   
 rear of the plane which are powered   
 by a nuclear engine stored inside the 
 plane.Inside the plane there are two  
 leather seats for the driver and one  
 passenger and in the back there are   
 seats for two other passengers.Also in
 the back there is a television,drinks 
 cabinet and games computer.           
  The dashboard is highly modified and 
 has every appliance to assist the     
 driver.Outside it has a sleek metallic
 finish with two scarlet stripes down  
 each side and wing.Another advantage  
 of this aircraft is that the nuclear  
 waste is destroyed by a harmless      
 chemical stored at the back of the    
 aircraft.                             </content>
