		<title>13Horse Trainer Lound (part 2)</title>
		<content> Each horse has its own stable which is
 cleaned out three times every day.    
 The horses are groomed every day and  
 are clipped 7 times a year.  The      
 saddles and bridles and other tack is 
 also cleaned regularly.  The horses   
 are fed on hay, oats, bran, sugar beet
 pulp, vitamins and minerals.  The diet
 varies from horse to horse.  Young    
 horses are exercised for l hour a day 
 and older horses for 4 hours a day.   
 They are never ridden bare back.  Mr. 
 Wright takes them hunting to get them 
 used to other horses.  He also takes  
 them to the disused gravel pits where 
 they can get used to water.  They are 
 also taken for hacks and sometimes go 
 jumping.  The horses are very valuable
 when they are trained.  He does not   
 train horses for other people.
