		<content>     {Farming}patterns have, and still 
 are slowly changing. Orchards of      
 apples and pears are gradually being  
 removed and the land used for         
 different purposes. Farms are mainly  
{arable,}the main crops being wheat,   
 potatoes, peas and oil seed rape which
 are grown in rotation . These{crops   
 are particularly suited to the clay   
 soil of the area. The soil has to be  
 limed regularly to compensate for     
 this.                                 
      Some farms have flocks of sheep  
 and a few have a dairy herd but there 
 is a tendency to change to arable     
 farming for{economic}reasons.         
      There is a high level of         
 mechanisation with farmers owning     
 their machinery and therefore there   
 has been a reduction in manual labour.
