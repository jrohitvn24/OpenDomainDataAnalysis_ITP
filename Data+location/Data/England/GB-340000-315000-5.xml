		<title>05MONTFORD BRIDGE - AMENITIES</title>
		<content> The village's amenities have changed  
 markedly over recent years.           
                                       
 The village no longer has a school,   
 a resident policeman, a working garage
 (it is now just a petrol station      
 combined with a shop and off-licence) 
 or sporting facilities.  Its Priest is
 now shared between three parishes.    
                                       
 The village does, however, possess a  
 good shop and Post-Office.  It has an 
 Inn, the Wingfield Arms, which runs   
 various functions such as Country and 
 Western evenings and also serves meals
 and snacks.  It has a village hall    
 (see p.3) and a mobile library which  
 visits fortnightly.  There is also a  
 village blacksmith and a carpenter.
