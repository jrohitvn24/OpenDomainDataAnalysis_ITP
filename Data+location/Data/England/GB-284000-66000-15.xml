 had two classrooms. There was a room  
 for 75 children aged 3_14 years.There 
 was a head master and one or two      
 assistant mistresses. There are now   
 four teachers and a hundred children. 
  There are two pubs in Abbotskerswell.
 Their names are Court Farm Inn and the
 Butchers Arms. The Court Farm Inn used
 to be an old farm and it still has the
 old barn in which they used to milk   
 the cows. The Court Farm Inn has a    
 euchre team, which is a card game.    
 It is owned by Whitbread Brewery and  
 has two bars.  The other pub in
