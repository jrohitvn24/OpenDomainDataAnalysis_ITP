		<title>14LOOKING AFTER PETS</title>
		<content> We have got 6 gerbils,2 adults and 4  
 babies.The babies were born 3 weeks   
 ago.When they were first born we gave 
 the adults milk to drink.We didn't    
 disturb them and we didn't clean the  
 cage out.It takes 3 weeks for baby    
 gerbils to open their eyes.We don't   
 take the babies out because it might  
 scare them.We feed the gerbils on     
 gerbil food,gerbil treats,lettuce,    
 peanuts,carrots and shredded wheat.   
 We clean the gerbils about every      
 6 weeks.Sometimes we let one of the   
 gerbils run on the snooker table,but  
 we have to be careful because there   
 are not any pockets on the holes.The  
 adults have got names but the babies  
 haven't.The light one is male and is  
 called "Cream".The dark one is called 
 "Coffee".There are 4 babies one light 
 one and 3 dark ones.The male and the  
 baby light one have albino eyes.      </content>
