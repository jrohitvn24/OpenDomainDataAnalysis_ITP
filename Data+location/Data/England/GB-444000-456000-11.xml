 One night P.C Calvert and P.C         
 Novakowsky were passing the Little    
 Ouseburn church when they saw a van   
 with three ladders . They went back   
 and saw the van had gone .P.C Calvert 
 saw three shadows on the church roof .
 "Come down !" but nothing happened .  
 "Police come down !". P.C Novakowsky  
 was scared !. They both said "lets go 
 home there is no-one here ". They hid 
 behind a grave stone. The robbers     
 thinking they had gone came down from 
 the roof with the lead . P.C          
 Novakowsky jumped on one and had a    
 fight . P.C Calvert radioed the chief 
 for more men .When the police van came
 they put the robbers in and took them 
 to prison .                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
