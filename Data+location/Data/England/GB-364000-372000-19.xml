		<content> TOURISM IS NOT ONE OF THE MAJOR       
 INDUSTRIES IN THE AREA.THIS BLOCK IS  
 SITUATED MIDWAY BETWEEN THE DERBYSHIRE
 PEAK DISTRICT AND NORTH WALES.THUS    
 THE MAIN TOURISM IS IN THESE AREAS AND
 THE PEOPLE OF THIS AREA ARE WITHIN    
 EASY REACH OF THESE AND OTHER         
 RECREATIONAL AREAS.THE MAIN TYPES OF  
 ORGANISED HOLIDAY IN THE AREA INVOLVE 
 THE USE OF BOATS AND BARGES WHICH USE 
 THE MANY WATERWAYS WHICH PASS THROUGH 
 NORTHWICH.THE NAVIGABLE RIVER WEAVER  
 AND THE TRENT AND MERSEY CANAL ARE TWO
 SUCH WATERWAYS AND HOLIDAYS OF THIS   
 TYPE PROVIDE A VERY ENJOYABLE BREAK.  
 NORTHWICH IS SO CLOSE TO THE CENTRES  
 OF MANCHESTER AND LIVERPOOL THAT IT   
 HAS NO NEED TO BE A POPULAR TOURISM   
 CENTRE.AND WITH CHESTER ONLY SIXTEEN  
 MILES AWAY NORTHWICH IS A TOWN WHICH  
 IS PASSED THROUGH RATHER THAN STOPPED 
 IN.                                   </content>
