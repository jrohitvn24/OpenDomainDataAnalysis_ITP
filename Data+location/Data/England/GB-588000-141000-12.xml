		<content> The village is served by a county     
 mixed junior and infant school. The   
 roll averages 90 pupils taught in     
 three classes. The school, founded in 
 1720, is now housed in a 125 year old 
 building, supplemented by two mobile  
 classrooms. At eleven years of age    
 pupils transfer to a fully            
 comprehensive school nine miles       
 distant in Tenterden. The school day  
 lasts from 9.00 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. with
 a break for lunch and playtimes. A    
 play group for pre-school children is 
 held in the village hall 3 mornings   
 each week, accommodating 17 children. 
 There is opportunity for adult        
 afternoon or evening classes in the   
 village hall, according to support and
 demand. Adults seeking vocational     
 classes have to travel to nearby      
 towns, as do teenagers for further    
 education.                            </content>
