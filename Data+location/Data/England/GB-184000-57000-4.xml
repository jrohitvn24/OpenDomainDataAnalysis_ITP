		<content>  The hedge in Cornwall is a very well 
 known feature.During the winter time, 
 as the winds and rain sweep across the
 countryside the sheep are not the only
 ones to be grateful for their shelter.

  As the lambs arrive,heralding the    
 coming of Spring, the first growth    
 appears.Daffodils,usually near        
 habitation,are followed by primroses. 
  In May and June,the jungle season,   
 what were narrow country lanes now    
 seem barely penetrable.A kaleidoscope 
 of changing colour is dominated by cow
 parsley and campion.                  
  The noisy hedge trimmer comes to cut 
 back-to make safe.Has it arrived late 
 enough to allow for next year's       
 profusion?Will the hedge continue to  
 confer its protection over its        
 inhabitants?
