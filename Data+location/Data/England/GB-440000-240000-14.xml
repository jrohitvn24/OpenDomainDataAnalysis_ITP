		<title>14Bretch Hill Social Problems</title>
		<content>Banbury's Bretch Hill area was built   
in the early 1960's as a council       
estate. In the mid 1970's came a small 
amount of private housing. The estate  
built by agreement with the G.L.C.     
gave 80% of the houses to London       
families, 15% to Birmingham, and 5%    
for local rehousing. Since building    
ended about 10 years ago the estate    
has become more stable. Unemployment   
is high with many young people         
jobless. Some unskilled workers have   
very low paid jobs. As a result of     
this nearly half the school children   
are entitled to free school meals and  
many families are very short of money. 
There are a high number of broken      
marriages leaving 1 child in 3         
supported by a single parent. Other    
children have a step parent. This means
that nearly half of all children have  
experienced great changes.             </content>
