		<content> Truro Railway Station provides an     
 important link in the West Country    
 Penzance to London line and is the    
 connection point for the branch line  
 to Falmouth. The A39, A3076, and A390 
 roads pass through Truro whilst the   
 remainder of the roads are of minor   
 classification. Truro has a Bus       
 Station which is an important centre  
 of the Cornish National Bus network.  
 There is a River link from Truro,(once
 an important port), to Falmouth for   
 pleasure trips, or occasional use by  
 industry such as Channel Foods, a fish
 processing plant. The area also serves
 as a centre for British Telecom and   
 sorting offices for the Post Office.  
 Truro has the lowest bridging point   
 over the Rivers Kenwyn and Allen which
 meet in the City, so this has long    
 made it a focus for local roads and   
 communications.                       </content>
