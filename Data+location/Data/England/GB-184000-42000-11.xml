		<title>11The Cornish Language</title>
		<content> At one time Cornwall had a language   
 that was completely different to      
 English.Nowadays very few people can  
 speak it although it is becoming      
 increasingly popular at night         
 school.Although it is not a living    
 language lots of names of Cornish     
 towns and villages are still          
 distinctly Cornish such as Portscatho 
 which means "a harbour for small      
 ships" or Merthyr,"a martyr's         
 chapel".The town of Truro is in fact a
 slightly changed version of its old   
 Cornish name"Tri-eru" meaning three   
 rivers,the three being the            
 Allen,Kenwyn and Truro.Three of the   
 most common old Cornish words used    
 nowadays occur in the poem which      
 starts"By Tre,Pol and Pen             
        Ye shall know Cornishmen"
