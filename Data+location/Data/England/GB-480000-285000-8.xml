   As well as the one post box in the  
wall of the post office, there is also 
a telephone box in the main street. In 
the village there are two bus stops    
with shelters. There are two express   
buses per day. On Tuesday the bus comes
five times because it is market day in 
Market Harborough. On any other day it 
runs four times a day. The householders
take turns to hold a whist drive each  
week which are very popular with the   
senior citizens.An art class and Womens
Institute meeting are also held at the 
widely used village hall.
