		<title>03LIFE AT KINGSWOOD SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The walls of our classroom are       
 covered with work: bird pictures,     
 patterns, book reviews and many other 
 things. We each have a tray in which  
 we keep all our books. We have an art 
 table, a book corner and a maths      
 table. We usually start with Assembly.
 On Thursday, we have an assembly when 
 we listen to the radio. Afterwards, we
 often do maths. There are 4 groups in 
 our class and we each do a different  
 subject and then change over. For Art 
 work we are doing about birds, so we  
 do something like a papier-mache bird.
 If we do topic maths, we do things    
 about shapes. When we do handwriting  
 we usually do it all together. At     
 playtime, the teacher will say, "pack 
 away now". Play-times are at 10.30,   
 12.00 and 1.45. For lunch we either   
 have sandwiches, a school dinner or go
 home.The school day is from 8.45-3.00.</content>
