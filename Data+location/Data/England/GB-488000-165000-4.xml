		<content>   My name is James and I am 11 years  
 old.  We moved to{Crown Wood}in       
{Bracknell}earlier this year.  When we 
 moved house I was very sad because I  
 was going to a very different home and
 a very different school.              
                                       
   Streetfield School was a{Middle}    
{School}for children between 9 and 14  
 years and it was much bigger than     
 Crown Wood which is a{Primary School} 
 for children between 5 and 11.        
                                       
   If you were sent to the{Headteacher}
 at Streefield it was because you had  
 been very naughty.  I thought it was  
 the same at Crown Wood so when I was  
 asked to see the Headteacher I ran    
 away but when I got back I did not get
 into trouble at all. We just talked.  
                                       
                                       </content>
