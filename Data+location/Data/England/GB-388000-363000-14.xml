		<title>14ROSE QUEEN FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> In 1959 the first Rose Queen Festival 
 was held.The Vicar Rev.Watkinson and  
 two other ladies organised it.The     
 Queen and attendants come from the    
 village school.The first Queen was    
 Isobel Day and the crowning ceremony  
 was held on the vicarage lawn.It was  
 held there until 1980 when the Queen  
 that year was crowned for the first   
 time in church because of bad weather.
 The ceremony is now held on the school
 lawn.It starts with a procession of   
 the retiring Queen,the present queen  
 and visiting queens from nearby       
 villages.Usually a band leads the     
 procession.The fete is opened by a    
 local person.The retiring queen crowns
 the new queen.She makes a short speech
 and is presented with an engraved Rose
 Bowl.Competitions take place and games
 and stalls provide the entertainment.
