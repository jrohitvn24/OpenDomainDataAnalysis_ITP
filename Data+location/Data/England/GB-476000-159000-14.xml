		<title>14Eversley's Mobile Library</title>
		<content>   {Eversley}is a small village and    
 many people rely on the mobile library
 for local information as well as for  
 borrowing books. The library's base is
 at{Fleet.}The County Council owns the 
 van and all the books. There are about
 six thousand books at the mobile      
 library, and they are changed         
 regularly. About a hundred people use 
 the library in a week and they look   
 after the books well, as not many are 
 damaged. The library has the same     
 driver most of the time. We saw eight 
 people choosing books while we were   
 there. They had a very wide choice,   
 fiction and non-fiction. The          
 librarians sold bookmarks and badges  
 and gave free vouchers for a local    
 leisure and fun park.
