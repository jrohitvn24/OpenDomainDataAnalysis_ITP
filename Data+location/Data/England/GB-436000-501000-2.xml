		<title>02HOUSING WELBURY</title>
		<content> Welbury is a small linear village     
 with a good variation of old &amp; new    
 houses.                               
 Many of the older houses are from     
 local brick with pan-tiled roofs.The  
 former Rectory,next to the church,is  
 now a private house and dates from the
 early 19th.century.There is a row of  
 old cottages built in the early 18th. 
 century and recently renovated, facing
 the new Springhill estate of 24       
 modern, stone built houses.These      
 houses were bought when new in 1968/69
 for approx.Â£8,000 and today sell for  
 around Â£65,000.Three  farms lie within
 the village boundary. Applegarth Manor
 was built in the 1890's by the        
 Merryweather family,but has been owned
 by the Sadler family for many years.  
 The "Duke of Wellington" still        
 operates as a public house with living
 accommodation,plus shop and cottage.  </content>
