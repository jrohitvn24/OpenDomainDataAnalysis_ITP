		<title>12BUNCE'S BREWERY.</title>
		<content>{ Wiltshire's youngest brewery}was     
 opened{one year ago}at the{Old Mill   
 in{Netheravon.                        
  The malt is put into a machine which 
 crushes it, then hot water is added   
 and it is left. They sieve the malt   
 out and put in hops to add flavour,   
 these are then removed and yeast is   
 put in. The yeast makes the froth on  
 the top of the beer. No special       
 ingredients are added to the brew. The
 beer is called {Bunce's Best Bitter   
 and the brewery produces{144 gallons  
 at each brewing, usually once a week. 
  Some people go to the brewery to buy 
 beer but usually it is taken round in 
 the brewery truck. It is not sold     
 through shop trade.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
