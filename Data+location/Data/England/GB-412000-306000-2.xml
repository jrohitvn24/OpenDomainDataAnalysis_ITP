		<title>02MY VILLAGE; BOTANY BAY.</title>
		<content>Botany Bay is a nice place. It has lots
of houses, when I say lots, it only has
27, but that is a lot for such a small 
area.                                  
  I live next to a corn field. Me and  
my friends play in it when it is long, 
but it is only long for a short time   
because the farmer cuts it down. Past  
the corn fields there is a strawberry  
field. I sometimes go and pick some    
strawberries for the farmer. There     
are also raspberries and gooseberries  
to pick later in the year.             
  The people who live in my village are
mainly nice, but there are lots of     
children who live near to us and they  
make a lot of noise, often waking me   
early in the morning.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
