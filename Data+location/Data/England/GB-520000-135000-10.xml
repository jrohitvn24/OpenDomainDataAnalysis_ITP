		<content> In July 1985{Rusper Primary School}has
 49 pupils.75% of the children attended
 a{playgroup}either in the village or  
 elsewhere before entering the school. 
 60% of children leaving the school go 
 on to the designated{secondary schools
 in Horsham i.e.Millais for girls,and  
 Forest School for boys.25% go on to   
 Holy Trinity School in Crawley which  
 is C.of E.and co-educational,and the  
 remaining 15% go on to a private      
 secondary school of their choice      
 outside the area.Almost two thirds of 
 the children attending Rusper Primary 
 School live outside the village,and   
 many live outside the{catchment area.}
 This number is increasing,as there are
 very few young families living in the 
 village,because property is so        
 expensive.
