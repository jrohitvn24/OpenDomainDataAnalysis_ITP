 to Redwick and Northwick.The remains  
 go to Oldbury.                        
 There are 175 pupils,and 6 teachers at
 Olveston primary.The school itself    
 will be 150 years old next year.      
 There used to be schools at Littleton

 schools.The catchment area for        
 Olveston school is flexible;pupils    
 come from{Severn Beach,Almondsbury,   
{Northwick(and Redwick),}but like all  
 smaller schools,the numbers are       
 dropping and more children go to {
