		<title>18Leigh Residents' Comments.</title>
		<content>  We went to interview a local resident
 at his flat in Leigh. We asked,"What  
 are the advantages of living here?"   
 He replied,"It's close to London and  
 there is a good train service. There  
 is a regular bus service to the       
 station, although unfortunately this  
 has been cut back recently. My flat is
 also near the sea and there are       
 beautiful walks too,in the Library and
 Marine Parade Gardens, where there are
 plenty of seats to sit on." We then   
 asked him what games he used to play  
 as a boy."Football,Beggar-my-neighbour
 and five stones. I used to play in the
 streets because there was less        
 traffic." Another resident said she   
 had lived in the area 39yrs.One of her
 most vivid memories was the sight of  
 lorry after lorry taking sand to tip  
 on the beach to make it sandy rather  
 than stony.                           </content>
