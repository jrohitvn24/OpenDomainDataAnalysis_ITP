 We asked 90 children.78 children      
 have been in a car, 64 families       
 owned a car.Many children have been on
 a bicycle , most families owned a     
 bicycle.few people have ridden on a   
 motorbike.Some familes own a          
 motorbike.Some people have ridden a   
 horse,one or two people own a         
 horse.There is a large coach firm     
 which started in the village.It is    
 called Bere Regis Coaches. In fifty   
 years it has grown into a firm with   
 over one hundred coaches. Some are
