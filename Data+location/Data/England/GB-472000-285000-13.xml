		<title>13The Police</title>
		<content> To join the Police Force you need 4   
 '0'levels including Maths and         
 English, or you can take 5 short      
 entrance exams. The main crime locally
 is stealing bicycles. The  police     
 recieve about 200 calls a week. There 
 are 3 cells in the police station 1   
 female and 2 male. One of the male    
 cells is especially for drunks. This  
 cell has a bed 6ins off the ground.   
 Inside the cell there is a toilet and 
 a sink. The chain is outside the cell,
 the reason for this is so the prisoner
 can't do anything silly. The personal 
 radios that the police use cost about 
 Â£300 and on a good day can trasmit 5  
 miles.The aerial is 110 feet high. The
 traffic control car is a Ford Sierra  
 and is equipped with road signs and   
 first aid. It is called a jam sandwich
 because of the orange stripe along the
 white boby work.                      </content>
