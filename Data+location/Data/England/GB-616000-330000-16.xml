		<content> Here is how a boy describes the       
 landscape as viewed from school.      
    "The land slopes gently away to the
 curving horizon.The meadowlands curve 
 upweards then down making the land    
 look hilly and lopsided.Young green   
 shoots of grass and flowers grow in   
 the tilted pastures wheresheep and    
 cows eat the young shoots and make    
 milk for their young to suckle.       
     The river runs by winding its way 
 through the fields.Houses are dotted  
 over the  land hiding behind trees and
 small woods.The sky is filled with    
 fluffy white,cotton wool clouds which 
 move slowly away.Church towers look   
 over the landscape unchanged for      
 hundreds of years."                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
