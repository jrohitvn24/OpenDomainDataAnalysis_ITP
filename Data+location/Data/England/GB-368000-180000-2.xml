		<title>02POLICING IN YATE</title>
		<content> There is no police station in Yate    
 because once Chipping Sodbury was     
 bigger than Yate so they put one in   
 Cipping Sodbury.There are 24 policemen
 who look after Yate.There are 4       
 policemen on the beat I think they do 
 this to keep an eye on people and     
 check to see if there is any          
 trouble.The biggest crime that        
 happened in Yate recently is a barn   
 that was set on fire by someone and it
 burnt thousands of pounds worth of    
 straw.The magority of calls are for   
 vandalisom thefts from cars and shop  
 lifters get caught 5 to 10 a week in  
 Yate but many more escape.
