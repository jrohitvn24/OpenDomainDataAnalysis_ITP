		<title>03        HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>    In general, the standard of living 
 in the area's homes is above the      
 national average, with scarcely any   
 unemployment, most homes having a     
 washing machine, freezer and          
 television(s), about half with video  
 recorders and tumble driers and 47% of
 our small survey owning one or more   
 home computers.                       
    As the number of children taking   
 packed lunches to school increases,   
 more and more families have the main  
 meal of the day in the evening,       
 although some still choose to cook at 
 midday.                               
    The use of the freezer to store    
 food is widespread, and most families 
 shop weekly or less frequently.       
    The older folk are looked after    
 too. Meals on Wheels (prepared at the 
 school) are delivered to their homes.
