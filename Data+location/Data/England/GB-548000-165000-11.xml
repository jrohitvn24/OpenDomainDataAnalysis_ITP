		<title>11A working farm 2.Cookham.</title>
		<content> Cookham Farm covers 50 acres(25       
 hectares) and is typical of the  small
  farms is this area.30 acres of the   
 land produce wheat and the rest is    
 used for growing vegetables and       
 wallflowers.The grain is sold directly
 to the flourmills.The vegetables are  
 sold locally and the wallflowers are  
 sent to the New Covent Garden market. 
 The farmer works the farm on his own  
 and much of the work is done          
 manually.He owns 3 tractors(one using 
 cage wheels for rolling in the        
 seeds)and a variety of agricultural   
 machinery.The soil is chalky and falls
 in category 10.There are 2 houses on  
 the farm ,one lived in by the farmer  
 and the other by a non-farmer tenant.
