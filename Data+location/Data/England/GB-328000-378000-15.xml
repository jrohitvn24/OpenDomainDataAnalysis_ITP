		<title>15MODERN INDUSTRY IN NESTON</title>
		<content>    Among some established industrial  
 concerns has appeared recently an     
 important{Hi-Tech}industry, run by the
 Marconi electronics company. Its main 
 business is the making of{guidance    
{systems}for{torpedos.}This development
 has helped to cure some of the{high   
{unemployment}in the area.There are    
 also hopes that there might be further
 developments in what could be a{      
{Science Park.}Unfortunately there is  
 prime farm-land on this site so there 
 is a conflict.                        
    There is also an{Advance Factory   
{Site}for small businesses. Some which 
 have taken advantage of this site are 
 garages, a bakery, double-glazing     
 contractors, pet supply wholesalers   
 and bathroom fitters.                 
   {Merseyside}is badly hit by the high
 unemployment of the 1980s and these   
 schemes offer hope for the future.    </content>
