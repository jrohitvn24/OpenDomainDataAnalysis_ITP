		<title>12HARROW WEALD COMMON</title>
		<content>{ This is part of the vast "weald" or  
{woodland,that in medieval times,      
{would have made travelling northwards 
{from London very difficult,but in the 
{18th century a road was cut through,  
{linking Harrow to Watford.            
  Today,people can enjoy delightful    
 rambles through leafy glades,or amble 
 through pastures where horses graze.  
 A picnic area on the side of the      
 hill,affords lovely views of Harrow   
 and the suburbs of north-west London. 
{                                      
{ Old Redding,}the road that winds it's
 way along the brow of the hill,       
 past a country club, an ancient inn - 
{"The Case Is Altered",}and the picnic 
 area, derives it's name from the old  
 English word{"ridding",}meaning a     
{"clearing through woodland".
