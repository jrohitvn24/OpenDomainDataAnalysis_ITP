 Air Force Connections                 
{In our area we have a field called the
{horse field.During the Second World   
{War lots of tents were put up in the  
{horse field.In the tents were American
{soldiers.They wanted to keep the      
{horses in the field but they gave them
{the wrong food and the horses were    
{taken out. My Nana used to give the   
{Americans butter, milk,bread and eggs.
{           There were connections     
{from the field to Folkingham airfield.
{The airfield was a Dakota field and   
{there are some buildings left,with the
{writing the soldiers wrote on them.   
{The American soldiers were part of    
{operation'Market Garden'which took    
{place around the bridge at Arnhem. }
