		<content> The most famous house in Withern was  
 the best preserved mud and stud       
 cottage in the country which has now  
 been removed, in its original state   
 and put in the Church Farm Museum in  
 Skegness. Some of the original        
 rectories, farmhouses and cottages in 
 the area have been privately restored 
 but for the most part, housing        
 comprises of modern urban development.
 However, there are no housing estates,
 most dwellings being scattered along  
 the Mablethorpe road which runs       
 through the village. The council has  
 erected several houses for local      
 workers and a number of old people's  
 bungalows.
