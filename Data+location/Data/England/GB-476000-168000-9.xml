		<title>09   THE HAWTHORNS SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school serving the{Woosehill}     
 development was origionally designed  
 as a one form Primary school and      
 opened in 1981 by a pupil.The site was
 the only one of three allocated by the
 County  Council to be used,due to     
 legal and economic difficulties.The   
 name{"Hawthorns"}was chosen by the    
 head;the school logo,depicting a spray
 of hawthorn,was designed by a pupil.  
 Planning took six months.The main     
 problems included insufficent cash    
 allocation,selection of staff and     
 difficulty in detailed planning in the
 absence of any accurate prediction of 
 the number of children expected.      
 Plans to extend the school were       
 proposed soon after the school opened.
 Building of the extension was         
 completed in September 1984 doubling  
 the size of the school.Numbers are    
 expected to peak at 400 in 1986.      </content>
