		<title>01VILLAGE OF BENINGTON (1).</title>
		<content>The centre of the village of Benington 
justifies the village's reputation of  
being one of the prettiest in Hertford-
shire. Its classic constituents:church,
stately home,ancient earthworks, folly,
old pub,attractive cottages, duck pond,
all surround an open village green.    
Ducks and geese amble across roadways  
and green oblivious of passing traffic.
Opposite the pond is the gate leading  
to theÂ£Lordship',a Queen Anne house    
with a laterÂ£Folly'attached replicating
the former Norman Castle which stood on
this site.The Gardens,ancient Moat and 
Folly are open to the publicon Wednes- 
days and Sundays at certain times of   
the year.The Church of St.Peter's dates
from Saxon times,as does theÂ£Lordship' 
site which was the former Palace of the
Saxon King of Mercia. (Cont)
