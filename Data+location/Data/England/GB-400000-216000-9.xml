		<title>09Restoration of the Church</title>
		<content>    In the twentieth century much has  
 been done in restoring the church both
 inside and outside. In 1904 the top of
 the two tiered pulpit was taken away  
 and later a new oak pulpit was        
 installed in place of the lower part. 
 Today a mammoth task is the           
 restoration of the roof which is      
 estimated will cost 25,000, of which 
 20,000 was raised in six months. The 
 organ also needs major restoration and
 the well known organ builders Bishop &amp;
 Son are already hard at work          
 rebuilding it. There is a faithful    
 congregation who come particularly to 
 the family service, although          
 attendance is not as high as it was   
 many years ago, probably owing to the 
 advent of radio and television. Even  
 the Methodist Chapel built in 1879 is 
 now used only for Christmas Fayres,   
 Jumble Sales and Barn Dances.         </content>
