		<title>07The Old Village Hall.</title>
		<content> The old village hall was used for its 
 final public use as a polling station 
 on May 9th 1985. There was sufficient 
 boarded floor left  for the polling   
 booths and clerks tables.There were   
 over five thousand nails in the maple 
 floorboards that were lifted.         
 Villagers raised over{Â£11,000}towards 
 the cost of the hall through their own
 fund raising efforts over the last few
 years. When the hall is finished the  
 new hall will have cost around{       
{Â£74,000.                              
 The old Hall was finally demolished on
 the weekend of June 1st 1985 and all  
 that remains as this is being written 
 is a pile of rubble and a brand       
 new,almost completed hall standing    
 just behind the site of the old one.
