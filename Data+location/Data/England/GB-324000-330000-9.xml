		<content> A retired clergyman living in         
 Rhyd-y-croesau was closely involved   
 with the local history group. He had  
 many stories to tell.{Legend}has      
 it that during the civil war in 1643  
{Charles ll}and his troops were        
 spending the night somewhere near     
 Rhyd_y_croesau. In order to foil his  
 enemy (the{(Parliamentarians)}the     
 King led his men on a road which      
 passed through what is now part of the
 garden of Milkwood cottage at         
 Rhydycroesau. Another story told of   
 English and Welsh armies battling each
 side of the stream beside Milkwood    
 cottage. The English were losing so   
 they tied their red coats to the      
 bushes. While the Welsh were still    
 firing at the coats the English       
 crept behind them, thus surprising    
 the Welsh and winning the battle.
