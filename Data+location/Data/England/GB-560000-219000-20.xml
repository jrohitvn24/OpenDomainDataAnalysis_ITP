		<title>20The Dunmow Flitch (Modern)</title>
		<content>   In order to win the Flitch - a side 
 of bacon - the married couple have to 
 prove to a jury that they have not had
 a cross word for a year and a day.    
 There is a judge, prosecuting council 
 for the bacon and defence council, all
 of whom are usually well-known        
 personalities such as Claire Rayner,  
 an 'agony aunt' for the Daily Mirror, 
 who will attract large crowds. The    
 jury is made up of six men and six    
 women who have to be single and from  
 the neighbourhood. Although these     
 proceedings are light hearted they    
 follow the pattern of a normal court  
 case.                                 
   The Flitch is presented to the      
 winning couples in a ceremony held    
 outside the Old Town Hall in the late 
 evening. In 1984 three of the four    
 couples on trial won their case and   
 were awarded their flitch of bacon.   </content>
