		<content> This factory was opened in l939 to    
 produce bombs.The site  was chosen    
 because it was close to towns which   
 could provide a 20,000 work force.The 
 semi-isolated area was ideal for      
 security reasons.The misty,damp       
 mossland reduced the risk of accidents
 and the mist obscured the site from   
 enemy aircraft.The workers filled the 
 bombs and assembled all the components
 in the bunkers.In the danger areas no 
 metal was allowed as it could cause a 
 spark.Special uniforms with wooden    
 fastenings and rubber soled shoes were
 worn.Wedding rings were covered with  
 sticking plaster.The workers changed  
 in the 'dirty' area and their uniforms
 were cleaned when they returned from  
 the 'clean' area after their shift.   
 Lorry drivers unloaded components in  
 the dirty area and clean workers took 
 them into the bunkers.                </content>
