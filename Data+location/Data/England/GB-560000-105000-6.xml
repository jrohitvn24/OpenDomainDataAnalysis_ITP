 attending{Hankham School}which is now 
 106 years old.we understand from the  
 East Sussex Record Office that it was 
 listed in the 1895 Sussex Directory as
 having been built in 1879 for 130     
 children and formed one of the        
 institutions controled by the Westham

 also a National School supported by   
 subscription of Westham and Pevensey  
 Parishes and built in 1852 to         
 occomodate 100 children.This          
 information was supplied to Hankham   
 School during its centinary year in 19
 79 by the East Sussex Record Office on
 the understanding that "the council   
 does not warrant its accuracy and that
 they nor any of their officers are    
 legally responsible for any           
 inaccuracies"ect.
