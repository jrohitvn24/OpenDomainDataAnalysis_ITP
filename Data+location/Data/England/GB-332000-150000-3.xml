		<title>03The Village of Brent Knoll</title>
		<content>                                       
      Brent Knoll village is based on  
 ribbon development. It has one long   
 main street and only a few small side 
 roads. The main street runs north     
 around the bottom of the Knoll from   
 the north to the west.                
      The houses are a mixture of old  
 and new. One house has a date on it   
 1688 and the latest were built this   
 year. Houses from all centuries make  
 up the rest. The church of St.        
 Michael's is built on the slopes of   
 the Knoll in the centre of the village
 and the village appears to have grown 
 around it. The school, built in 1861, 
 is also in the middle.                
      There is no industry in the      
 village and farming is the main       
 business. The north end of the village
 has several farms.
