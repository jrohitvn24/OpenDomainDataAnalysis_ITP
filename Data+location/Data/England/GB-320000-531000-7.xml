		<content> The old police station was opposite   
 the Sun Inn in the village,and then   
 moved opposite Chapel House. There has
 been a police house in{Bassenthwaite  
 since 1860. There has not been much   
 crime in Bassenthwaite, it is a very  
 quiet place. The worst crime was when 
{Armathwaite Hall}was burgled in 1957- 
 58, Â£600 were taken. Many changes have
 occurred. The only means of           
 communication was the local telephone.
 Now they use radios and computers     
 which are based in their headquarters 
 at Penrith, they are able to talk with
 all the stations and men in the       
 county. There have been no police dogs
 in the area. The policeman's job is   
 to uphold the law. He is appointed in 
 the Queens name by the local police   
 committee. He does not arrest people  
 for things like riding their bike     
 without a light,he just warns them.   </content>
