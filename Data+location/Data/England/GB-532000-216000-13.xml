		<title>13FARMING at WESTMILL</title>
		<content>Mrs.Burns who owns the trout farm has  
been running it for seven years.The    
trout are kept in nine ponds which are 
in three acres of farmland. The River  
Rib which is nearby is the source of   
their water supply. There is about 100 
million gallons of water going through 
these ponds a day.                     
Altogether they have 75,000 trout which
are bought as fry from Berkshire and   
are reared for the table. The fry are  
kept for at least nine months when they
will weigh 8oz.but they can grow to    
4lbs. They are fed three times a day on
high protein pigmented pellets which   
make them look pink and shiny.         
The trout are available all the year   
round. There is no problem with        
pollution but the trout can get        
whirling disease which is not harmful  
to the fish or the consumer. The trout 
are sold either locally or in London.  </content>
