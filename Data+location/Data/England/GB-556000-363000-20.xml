		<title>20Home Life in Skegness</title>
		<content> I live in a bungalow below sea level  
 on Old Roman Bank. I enjoy using our  
 acre lawn. My home is near both a golf
 club and the shingle beach. After     
 geeting home from school I get changed
 and play on the shingle beach until   
 8 pm. My dad is an art designer and   
 works in Alford. My mum is the        
 secretary of St Matthew's Church. I   
 have many friends. We live a fair way 
 from town.                            
 The most famous thing in Skegness is  
 the Clock Tower.                      
 The police station is on Park Avenue, 
 next to the Town Hall. My family once 
 owned a guest house on Park Avenue    
 called Savona. I think Park Avenue is 
 the richest area because of all the   
 guest houses and hotels.
