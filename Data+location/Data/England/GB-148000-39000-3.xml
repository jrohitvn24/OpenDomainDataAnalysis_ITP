		<content>  The St.Ives school was situated on   
 the{Stennack}.It was built of granite 
 in 1880,and won an architectural award
 for it's designer Silvanus Trevail.   
  The school was known as the St.Ives  
 board school with separate girls and  
 boys departments.All ages attended the
 school and when the population        
 increased,the{Belyars}school (now the 
 comprehensive)was built for over 11's.
 Then,in 1967,it became a solely a     
 Junior school after the new{Infant }  
 school was built.It closed in 1984    
 when the new{Junior}school was opened.
  Since then there has been a vigorous 
 local campaign to save it from        
 demolition and to turn it into a      
{community}centre. The County Council  
 wish to use the site for a Fire/Police
 station but the matter is still       
 unresolved.
