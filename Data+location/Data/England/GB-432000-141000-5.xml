 appears quiet and sleepy, but this is 
 not so.                               
     Old thatched cottages blend with  
 flint, tiled cottages and new houses  
 are interspaced. Warden controlled    
 bungalows are amongst the latest      
 development along with a new estate of
 private houses.                       
     There is a church and a chapel in 
 the village. The Memorial Hall is used
 for many village activities including:
 Playgroup, Dog Training, Friendship   
 Club for the elderly, Bingo (twice a  
 month), Whist Drives, Soft Furnishing 
 classes and the Women's Institute meet
 there once a month.
