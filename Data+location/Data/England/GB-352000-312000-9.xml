		<content>  The first transport system that came 
 to the area was the canal,which is now
 disused .It used to run near Upton    
 Magna,through Berwick Wharf and then  
 Uffington.By the canal in Uffington   
 there are some cottages called canal  
 cottages they are called canal        
 cottages because the canal used to run
 past them.There is still evidence of  
 the canal.The evidence is the old     
 canal bridge which is by Upton Forge. 
 The other evidence is where the water 
 used to run.Then we had the Railway   
 which was used for quick              
 communication,but now the station at  
 Upton Magna has been closed down.We   
 have the narrow lanes and roads  which
 are used for cars and occasionly a bus
 .But now they are planning to build a 
 motorway that might go through the    
 area.This will be the third major     
 transport system to effect the area.  </content>
