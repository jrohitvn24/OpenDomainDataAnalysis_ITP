		<title>14THE RAILWAY TODAY SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   In 1972 British Rail closed the line
 between Wareham and Swanage. Shortly  
 afterwards Swanage Town Council       
 started to demolish the track, the    
 platform, the water-tower and the     
 turnstile. The area became a scrap-   
 yard and many private societies failed
 to get the railway back in working    
 order, until now when a service is    
 provided again.                       
   The original platform, canopy       
 and water-tower have been completely  
 restored. The track bed has been dug  
 out, properly drained and a run-round 
 loop has been laid. The ground control
 points, signalling and telephone      
 systems are still being worked on. A  
 completely restored turn table has    
 come from the London Transport Museum 
 which will replace the present hand   
 driven one.
