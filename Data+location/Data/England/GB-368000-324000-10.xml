		<title>10ADRIAN'S SATURDAY</title>
		<content>   At 7.00a.m. I wake, change and go   
 downstairs. By 8.00 I am Rotovating   
 the land to grow marigolds. My mum and
 dad run a herb nursery. The marigolds 
 go into medicines and creams. After   
 rotavating I go in and have five      
 rounds of toast. At 11.00a.m. I go out
 to get the coal and chop up logs. I   
 go down to the post office to collect 
 the paper for mum and dad and get some
 sweets for myself.                    
   At  12.00p.m. I have to feed the    
 fish in the pond.                     
   We have lunch at 1.00 o'clock and I 
 go out to do some weeding. We have two
 acres of herbs to weed.In the         
 afternoon I also have to mow the      
 lawns. It is very tiring work and I   
 sweat a lot. At about 3.30 I go inside
 to watch T.V.. Later I go outside and 
 help my dad. We are cutting down a    
 hedgeso that we can see the Wrekin.   </content>
