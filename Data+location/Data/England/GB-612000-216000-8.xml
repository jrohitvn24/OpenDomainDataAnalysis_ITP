		<content> Mr D Hiller likes the caravan park    
 because it is open.He says that       
 there are not many  entertainments in 
 the evening.He says there is a fishing
 lake,amusement park and twice a week  
 there is live entertainment.The rates 
 people have to pay is Â£420 pounds for 
 the year.Mr Hiller says that the      
 caravan site has been open for 25years
 and most of the people have been      
 coming for at least 20years.He says he
 mainly gets retired people.They enjoy 
 it because it is peacful and away from
 traffic.All the people in the caravan 
 park are very friendly and            
 interesting.Mr Hiller says that there 
 are at least 400 people that come to  
 the caravan park and the number       
 increases each year.
