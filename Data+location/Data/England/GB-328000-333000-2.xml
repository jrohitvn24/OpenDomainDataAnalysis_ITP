		<content> With the coming of the{railway}in 1895
{Gobowen}developed at a pace. The new  
 section of the{A5 road}encouraged     
 further development,as did the arrival
 of the{Orthopaedic Hospital}from      
 Baschurch. The station,alas, is no    
 longer our pride and joy,and is being 
 allowed to crumble,despite the fact   
 that it is a{listed building}of       
 outstanding historical and            
 architectural importance. The A5 which
 virtually bisects the village, is     
 getting busier and busier.            
   Work will soon begin on the         
{Gobowen,Whittington and West Felton   
{By-pass.}The traffic through Gobowen  
 will be reduced by 85 per cent.Old    
 prints show that the centre of Gobowen
 used to be very attractive. If only   
 the station could be restored to its  
 former glory,the village would be     
 revitalised.                          </content>
