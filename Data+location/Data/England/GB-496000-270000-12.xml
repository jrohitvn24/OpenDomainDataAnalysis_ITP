		<content> We interviewed nine men between the   
 ages 15 - 25 to find out what they do 
 in their spare time.From the results  
 from our surveys,it seems there are   
 many sport facilities in our area.    
 The most popular sports facilities are
 recreation grounds and lakes.The most 
 popular places for night life are pubs
 and discos.We found that many people  
 in our area watch a lot of television,
 the programmes they watch are Miami   
 Vice, pop programmes, The Young Ones. 
 The programme which has the highest   
 percentage of people watching is      
 Tomorrow's World.We also found that   
 people over the age of 20 watch       
 Tomorrow's World much more than people
 from 15 to 20.The few women that we   
 interviewed seemed to join clubs and  
 go out to places to do with keep_fit  
 and slimming.
