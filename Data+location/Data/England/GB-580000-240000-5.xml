		<content>{Ecology}The area is mainly arable but 
 does include several old meadows,     
 several ancient hedgerows, an old     
 sandpit known locally as snugs pit,   
 and a wood known as heavens wood. The 
 area is criss crossed by many         
 footpaths, many of which go from      
 village to village and very well used 
 today. The roadside verges are very   
 important conservation areas          
 especially as economic factors are    
 preventing regular cutting and        
 spraying; so many wild flowers are    
 flourishing including orchids.        
    Several lanes are listed by Essex  
 County Council as conservation areas  
 not to be developed at all.           
    Animals indigenous to area include 
 Badgers, Foxes, Rabbits and Deer, Grey
 squirrels are also numerous.
