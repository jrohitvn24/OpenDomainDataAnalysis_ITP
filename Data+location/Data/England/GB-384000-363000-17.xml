{Chronicle }14 June 1985.              
  ' Even Headmasters make mistakes!'   
 The issue in question was the winning 
 team in the{Congleton Primary Schools 
{Sports Association}football league    
 competition.The season closed with    
 Daven school and Quinta school sharing
 the leadership.A mistake in the       
 calculation of goal difference lead to
 the premature presentation of the     
 trophy and winning medals to the Daven
 team.A further investigation          
 categorically proved that the Quinta  
 were outright winners but to minimise 
 disappointment to the Daven team they 
 were permitted to keep their medals   
 and a duplicate set of medals was     
 presented to the Quinta team.The      
 schools decided to share the trophy   
 for display purposes.
