		<content> The area rises to{over 150 metres in  
{places.                               
 The area has sufficient topsoil       
 coating the chalk to create an        
{intensive mixed farming}region.Along- 
 side good pastures,cereals and oil-   
 seed rape are currently cultivated.   
 The area is quite well wooded but     
 mainly in the form of{commercial      
{plantations}covering hillsides and    
 spurs.Often these consist of rapid-   
 growing conifers.Game birds are raised
 around these plantations. The native  
 tree of chalk downland is the beech.  
 The only real concentrations of       
 population are the{dormitory villages 
 of Gosmore and St.Ippolyts that hang  
 like a ribbon from Hitchin in the     
 North East near to the Little Ippolyts
 brook and the straight B656.No main   
 roads or railway lines cross the area.
