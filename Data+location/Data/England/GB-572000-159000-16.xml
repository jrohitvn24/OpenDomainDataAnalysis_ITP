		<title>16HOUSING IN AYLESFORD AREA</title>
		<content> There have been dwellings in the      
 locality since Pre-Roman              
 times.Existing housing stock dates    
 from the early 17th century to post   
 war.Afew houses in Aylesford and some 
 farm houses exhibit Tudor,timber frame
 and ragstone contruction.             
 19th century terraced cottages built  
 originally for local cement workers   
 are a distinct feature of part of     
 Eccles.Post-war development makes up  
 most of the remaining housing stock in
 that village.A small number of pre-war
 houses,both local authority and       
 private,are to be found on the        
 outskirts of Aylesford.Central village
 housing is a mixture of 19th century  
 terraced cottages and 20th century    
 semi-detached pairs.The Kits Coty     
 Estate (Bluebell hill) is an area of  
 private housing of various types on   
 large plots.                          </content>
