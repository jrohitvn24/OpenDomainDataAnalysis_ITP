		<title>13The Transit Camp</title>
		<content> At first it didn't seem to us that    
 there was much local{industry}until we
 went to look at the transit camp.At   
 first we found out that it got it's   
 name,because it was used as a base or{
{barracks}for troops in transit to,or  
 from the continent.                   
 Now it is used for a range of purposes
 ;at least 10 companies are based there
 dealing with trailers and             
 containers,used in the{export and     
{import}business.We tried to find out  
 what they dealt with,but we were told 
 that it was not wise to tell us for   
 security reasons;the camp is fenced   
 and well gaurded.                     
 In addition there were 4 firms which  
 were in car repairs,2 in marine       
 building,and also Autoprint.They were 
 kind enough to give us a tour,they    
 deal with all sorts of printing,and   
 are now beginning to print books.     </content>
