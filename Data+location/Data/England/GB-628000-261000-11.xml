		<title>11Framlingham Mere</title>
		<content>Framlingham Mere is a lake beside the  
castle, probably created by digging out
the soil which is now the castle mound.
It used to be much bigger,but it is    
still a good place for seeing many     
forms of wildlife. It has reeds and    
small islands. There are many breeds of
birds,altogether we have seen 52       
different kinds including cormorant,   
muscovy duck, shellduck and a barn owl.
The animals consist mainly of rabbits, 
mice, voles, shrews and hedgehogs. You 
see amphibians around the streams maybe
even the crested newt. In the River Ore
flowing in and out of the Mere there   
 re feshwater fish, stoneloach, minnow 
and sticklebacks. There is much pond   
life such as shrimps,beetles and larvae
of many kinds. Nearby is a wood with   
bluebells. The trees are oak,willow    
elder and hawthorn. In the hedgerows   
you may find blackberry,rosehips, etc. </content>
