		<content>{VALLEY FARM:}Originally Valley Farm   
 was used for a resting place for      
 cattle and they fattened them up for  
 market.                               
 Walking cattle from Wales was very    
 tiring so they stopped to rest at     
 quite a few farms and Valley Farm was 
 the last stop before they got to the  
 market.                               
 Valley Farm concentrates on Livestock 
 and they grow hay and buy food.       
 There are 4 people that work there,1  
 full time worker and 3 part time      
 workers.                              
 There are 550 sheep,2000 chickens and 
 3 horses used for show jumping.       
 10 fields are for grazing and 25 for  
 growing crops so there are 25 fields. 
 They have no Combine Hravesters but 3 
 tractors.There are 3 sheepdogs,4 cows 
 and 1 bull.                           
 Altogether the farm is 125 acres.     </content>
