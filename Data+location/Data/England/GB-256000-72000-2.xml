		<title>02Origin of Dartmoor Legends</title>
		<content> On a bright summer's day Dartmoor is  
 beautiful, but in winter when the     
 weather is bad Dartmoor can be a      
 dangerous and frightening place.      
 There are many mires and bogs, and    
 treacherous mists can descend very    
 quickly. Over the years unusual events
 have occurred to travellers over the  
 moor and many strange legends  have   
 arisen to account for them.           
   Lots of the legends have peculiar   
 names. Here are some to give you an   
 idea :Goemagot ,Vixanna the Witch of  
 Vixen Tor,The Legend of Grey Wethers, 
 The Weaver  of Dean -Combe, The Evil  
 Rider, The Legend of Abbot's Way,     
 Cranmere Benjie, Childe the Hunter,   
 The Bed of Tulips, Jay's Grave,       
 Stephen's Grave, The Legend of the    
 Golden Maize, See No Evil, The Hairy  
 Hands and Crazywell Pool.             
   They make very interesting reading. </content>
