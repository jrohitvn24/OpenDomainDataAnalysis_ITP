		<title>14THE DOVER-DEAL RAILWAY LINE</title>
		<content> The Dover and Deal Joint Railway was  
 opened on 17 June 1881. It was a rare 
 example of co-operation between two   
 rival private companies;The South     
 Eastern Railway and the London,Chatham
 and Dover Railway. To complete their  
 venture the partners had to dig out   
 the 1412 yards long Guston Tunnel.    
 Once open the line served not only    
 Dover and Deal but two communities    
 in-between,for intermediate stations  
 were opened at Walmer and Martin Mill.
 It encouraged the growth of the latter
 village which,in the inter-war period 
 was advertised as "The Station for    
 St.Margaret's Bay with it's sandy     
 beach."                               
 Since 1945 the number of tourists     
 using the line has declined and local 
 villages,especially Martin Mill,have  
 grown as dormitories for the larger   
 towns on the line like Dover.         </content>
