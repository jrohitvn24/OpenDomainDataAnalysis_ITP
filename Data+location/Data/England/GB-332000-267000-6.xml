		<content> The area though covering few houses,  
 has a number of young people aged 10  
 to 24. Those still at school travel   
 8km by coach to Wigmore. After taking 
 G.C.E. 'O' level exams they go to     
 Leominster or Hereford schools or     
 colleges of further education to study
 'A' levels or courses in business     
 studies, catering, nursing or other   
 courses designed to lead to higher    
 education. Most of the boys go to     
 agriculture college and return to work
 on their father's farm. One boy is    
 studying ecology at a polytechnic.    
 Unlike their mothers, most girls      
 expect to leave the area and few      
 expect to return when their training  
 is complete.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
