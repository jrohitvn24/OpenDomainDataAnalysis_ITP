		<title>03A HISTORY OF KINGS NORTON</title>
		<content>The {Romans, Saxons and Normans} left  
their mark on King's Norton.The Saxons 
included nortune in the Manor of       
Bromsgrove. In Norman times it was     
taken by the King so it was called the 
King's North town.There is little left 
of the Norman Church but the present   
St.Nicolas is over seven hundred years 
old.In the time of Edward 1 the manor  
was owned by Roger Mortimer who was    
hanged by Edward 2 in London. The      
Saracen's Head was the bailiff's house.
King James 1 allowed a market and two  
{fairs}. In 1629 the Grammar School was
opened. During the Civil War there was 
a skirmish near the village.Later Kings
Norton was a {nailmaking centre}.      
The canal opened in 1799 and the rail- 
way to Gloucester in 1840.Our primary  
school was built in 1876.Today it is in
a busy suburb of Birmingham.By members 
of Kings Norton Primary School.        </content>
