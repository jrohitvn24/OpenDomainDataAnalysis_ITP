		<title>15HORSES ON WHITE LODGE STUD</title>
		<content>  White Lodge Stud Farm feed their     
 horses on hay and a mix of barley and 
 oats in the winter and grass in the   
 summer. They also have vitamins to    
 make their bones stronger so they can 
 win races. The horses go to Geoffrey  
 Wragg in Newmarket for training. They 
 have to go in a trailor. To get them  
 used to going up dangerous trailor    
 ramps, there is a bank on the stud    
 that slowly gets steeper, and if they 
 are going to fall, there is a board to
 stop them. They then walk straight    
 into the box and the valuable horses  
 are not hurt. They stay with Mr Wragg 
 until they are about 4 yrs old. The   
 max. age for a horse is 25-27yrs. When
 the mares retire from racing they meet
 stallions to have foals. The mare has 
 to mind the foal doesn't hit the wall 
 of the stable as she pushes. A horse  
 is pregnant for 11months from Jan-Mar.</content>
