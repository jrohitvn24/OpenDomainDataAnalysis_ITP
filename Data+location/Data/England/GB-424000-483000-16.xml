		<title>16Shopping around Snape,Yorks.</title>
		<content>   There is only one shop in the       
 village which sells many different    
 things.It is also the Post Office.It  
 is mainly used by children and older  
 people.Most people go to Bedale and   
 Northallerton to do their weekly      
 shopping,and to buy items like clothes
 and shoes.Middlesbrough and York are  
 the furthest people travel to shop for
 clothes and major items. Harrogate is 
 also a favourite shopping centre.     
 People who don't own a car either use 
 the village shop or travel by bus to  
 Bedale on a Tuesday or to Ripon on    
 Thursdays.A mobile shop visits the    
 village once a week.
