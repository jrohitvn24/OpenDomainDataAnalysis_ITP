		<content>I live in a maisonette.I like living   
there but I would rather live in a     
bungalow where every thing is on one   
floor.My parents are looking for a     
house at the moment.I have lived in    
three places since I was born.The      
first a high rise flat where I lived   
till I was three,then we moved to a    
maisonette.I like living where I am    
but soon we shallbe moving to another  
house.I don't know where it is but I   
hope it will be nice.There are a lot   
of large houses in area.Some are       
detached and some are                  
semi-detached.Many have garages and    
most have front and back gardens.The   
average number of bedrooms is          
three.They all have inside bathroom    
and W.C.There are also large numbers   
of flats and maisonettes.Some large    
blocks of flats are very shabby.
