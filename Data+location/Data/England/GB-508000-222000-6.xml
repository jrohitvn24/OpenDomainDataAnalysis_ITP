		<content> On July 1st I interviewed an old man. 
 I gave him a list of questions but he 
 did not answer them, he just went on  
 and this is what he told me.          
 Montrose Avenue was once a small lane.
 THe Biscot Mill was once a real mill. 
 From the Biscot Mill to New Bedford   
 Road was all cornfields. People had to
 pay road charges. Houses have not     
 changed at all. The garden was really 
 an old piece of old land. There were  
 five cinemas, one in Park Street, Mill
 Street, High Town, Dunstable Road and 
 Gordon Street. It was six pence to go 
 to the cinema in the old days. One    
 person in ten had got a car. After the
 second world war there were street    
 parties in St. Michaels and           
 St.Ethelberts. A car in those days    
 cost Â£100. A good wage was Â£3.50 in   
 1935. A house cost about Â£750.
