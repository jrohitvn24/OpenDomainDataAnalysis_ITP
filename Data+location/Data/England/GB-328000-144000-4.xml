       A TYPICAL FAMILY DAY            
 In our family there are two children  
 and two parents.We live in a house in 
 a house in the middle of West         
 Huntspill village.My day starts at    
 about 7.00 a.m.When I wake up,I like  
 to read for about half an hour.My     
 mum's alarm clock rings at half past  
 seven in the morning.My mum comes in  
 to say good morning and to tell myself
 and my sister to get out of bed.We go 
 down stairs to have breakfast and we  
 help mum put the plates out on the    
 table.Our cat comes  running into the 
 kitchen when she hears us come down   
 stairs,she meouws loudly asking for   
 her food ,we give her meat and milk.  
 For breakfast,we eat cereal with milk 
 and sugar and toast and jam.My sister 
 and I drink fruit juice and my mum and
 dad drink tea.                        </content>
