		<title>17A New Water Main-Kinoulton</title>
		<content>                                       
      In the past six months there have
  been a lot of traffic problems in    
 Kinoulton because workmen from the    
{Severn-Trent Water Authoriy}have been 
 digging up the roads to lay a{new     
{water main.}The old pipes have become 
 corroded as they were made of{cast    
{iron.}The new pipes are made of{Medium
{Density Polyethylene}and are expected 
 to last about 60 years.               
        The roadworks have caused many 
 difficulties as cars, buses,etc. have 
 had to squeeze up to the side of the  
 road, sometimes causing damage to the 
 vehicles.                             
      Since the roadworks began our    
 school bus has had to go to Upper     
 Broughton first and then to Hickling, 
 instead of the other way round.In this
 way the bus could avoid passing where 
 the men were working.                 </content>
