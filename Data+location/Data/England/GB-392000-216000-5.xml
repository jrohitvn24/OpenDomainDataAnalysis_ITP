		<content> In the centre of the village is a     
{council estate}of houses and flats.The
 first houses were built after the     
 1939-45 war. A stone plaque{dated 1949
 was inserted in the front of the first
 pair of{semi-detached houses}to be    
 completed. The houses were on three   
 sides of a large village green.       
 Early in the 1960s{three blocks of    
{flats}were built to the west of the   
 council houses. The flats house a     
 total of 80 families but provide only 
{2-bedroomed accommodation.}This has   
 contributed to a transitory population
 as families tend to move as soon      
 as children begin to grow up, needing 
 more bedrooms.                        
{Prefabricated houses}were erected     
 just after the war to provide cheap   
 quickly-built housing to last ten     
 years. In 1975 they were demolished to
 make way for{new terraced houses.     </content>
