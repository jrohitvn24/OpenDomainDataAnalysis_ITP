		<content>    We did a survey of what our area   
 offers us in our{leisure time.}The    
 biggest places we have are a          
{recreation park}which has got tennis  
 courts and bowling greens and a large 
{playing field}with a set of swings and
 slides near by.                       
    We have a good{community centre    
 which has got things like a karate    
 club, ladies' keep-fit, indoor bowls, 
 first aid training, a play group, a   
 youth club and disco dancing.         
    Some of us enjoy watching{sport}-  
 there are two local football teams and
 a cricket team. The cricket team has a
 junior section and boys can join from 
 about the age of nine. A new{golf     
{course}is being built and many of us  
 want to become members.               
    We all like going to the{beach}and 
 we often see people there sea-angling.
