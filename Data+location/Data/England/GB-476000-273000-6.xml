		<title>06Problems in OLD</title>
		<content>  The only shop in Old is the Post     
 Office run by the same lady for 36    
 years.It is very small,three customers
 making it crowded,and sells sweets.The
 main improvement requested by         
 villagers is a shop for groceries.They
 have to travel to Kettering (10 miles)
 or Northampton (12 miles) for their   
 main shopping.{Mobile shops},selling  
 groceries,wet fish and fish &amp;         
 chips,provide an important service for
 those who find it difficult to shop in
 town.                                 
                                       
   Another complaint is the number of  
 heavy {lorries}which go through the   
 centre of the village.The villagers   
 would like to see these banned due to 
 the {noise}and the{dangers }produced  
 by them.
