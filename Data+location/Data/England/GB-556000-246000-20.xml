		<title>20TRANSPORT IN LINTON</title>
		<content>  Those people who we have interviewed 
 thought that there was a great need in
 Linton for a car park.Everybody       
 thought that the bus service was      
 adequate for their needs.People       
 thought that there was an advantage in
 having a car in Linton.More people    
 owned a car than any other            
 vehicle;about 10% of them own 2       
 cars.It appears to us that the yellow 
 lines in Linton are controversial.The 
 A604 is always busy,nearly everybody  
 in Linton uses it frequently to get to
 work and shops etc.The roads are      
 usually blocked up.The busiest place  
 in Linton is at the infant school     
 during the mornings and afternoons.   
 People seem to walk only a short      
 distance mainly to the shops.
