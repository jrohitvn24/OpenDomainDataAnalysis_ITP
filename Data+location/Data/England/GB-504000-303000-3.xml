		<content> Every 10 metres we identified and     
 measured a tree.We found that the     
 trees were a variety of sizes and     
 ages.About one quarter were           
 sycamores.Just under half were        
 conifers.The tallest tree was a Bishop
 Pine.It was about 30 metres tall with 
 a girth of 7 metres.The smallest were 
 saplings.There were also rhododendron 
 bushes and several dead trees.Other   
 trees were Fir,Scots Pine,Beech and   
 Ash.
