		<title>16MY FAMILY'S USUAL WEEKEND</title>
		<content>   After getting home from school on   
 Friday I watch T.V. and at 5 o'clock  
 mum calls my two younger brothers and 
 I for tea. Afterwards I take my pony  
 for a trek in Blakeney Hill woods. My 
 mum takes the car to shop in Lydney   
 and arrives home at 8 p.m. After tea  
 and biscuits for supper I go to bed.  
   Saturday morning sees all the family
 going down the hill to the butcher's  
 in Blakeney. We usually buy "something
 with chips" for our lunch at home. In 
 the afternoon, I go riding again while
 mum and dad work on the garden and    
 house. For tea we usually have        
 sandwiches, then watch T.V. before    
 bed.                                  
   Two of us go to Sunday School in the
 morning. We all enjoy our Sunday Roast
 and the afternoon follows the Saturday
 pattern. In the evening we all have to
 wash our hair before bed !            </content>
