		<content> The Downs Banks consists of 160 acres 
 originally purchased by John Joule &amp;  
 Sons brewers of Stone.They were       
 endowed by public subscription and    
 presented to the National Trust on    
 July 22nd 1950 as a thanks offering   
 for victory and as a memorial to those
 who fell in the second world war.     
   The nature of the Downs Banks is    
 determined by the free                
 draining,acid,sandy soil of the hills 
 and valley sides and the ill drained  
 clay of the valley soil.              
  The decidous woodland was planted    
 prior to 1840.Pine and spruce have    
 been planted by the National Trust.   
  A trackway crosses the Downs and is  
 traditionally regarded as part of the 
 ancient pack horse route from Chester 
 to the East Midlands.
