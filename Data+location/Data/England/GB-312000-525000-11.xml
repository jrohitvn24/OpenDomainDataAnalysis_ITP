 basically outdoor manual workers plus 
 farmers wives who either work on the  
 farm or take in paying guests. 42     
 commuters i.e. those who travel out of

 are professionals. Occupations range

 There are few prospects locally for   
 the children, those who want to pursue
 a profession must travel to nearby    
 towns, first to study and then to find
 work. Most of the retired population  
 live in their own homes or with their 
 families. There is no sheltered       
 housing available.                    </content>
