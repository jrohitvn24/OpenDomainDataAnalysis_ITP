		<title>18DALLAM TOWERS</title>
		<content> Dallam Towers as it is today was built
 in 1720,but there is a much older site
 which is on a prominent hill in the   
 park.In the 18th century this site was
 made into a leval platform but with   
 remains being found from Norman Times 
 this suggests that the site was       
 developed much earlier.It is also     
 thought that it was originally the    
 site of a Roman Fort.Dallam Towers was
 built by Daniel Wilson and he         
 landscaped the park which surrounds   
 the house.The descendants of Daniel   
 still occupy the house and estate     
 today.The house itself is a large and 
 very impresive Manor,as was very      
 typical of the early 1700's.Infront of
 the house there is a sunken garden.The
 gardens at the back of the Tower are  
 also a splendid afair and are         
 sometimes open to the public on       
 National Garden Days.                 </content>
