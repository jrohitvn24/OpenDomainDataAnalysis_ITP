		<title>03 BUYING A COUNCIL HOUSE</title>
		<content>                                       
   The Middle Park and Mottingham      
Estates are run by the local councils. 
The rent and rates are kept low so     
people can rent a house or even buy it.
Once they have bought their house they 
can put on an extention or put on      
porches or leaded or french windows.   
They can change the front door or knock
down parts of the house.If the person  
has not bought the house then they must
ask for planning permission if they    
want to build an extention also they   
have to have their neighbours          
permission because it might block      
their neighbours light.People that want
to buy their council houses can and    
they are given a discount for the      
amount of time they have lived there.  
At the moment the houses on the estates
are valued at about 30,000 pounds but  
tenants can get up to 60% discount.    </content>
