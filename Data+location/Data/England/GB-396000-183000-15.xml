		<title>15A DAIRY FARM,SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   Brook Farm,like most modern farms,  
 has made use of modern technology.They
 have installed two computers,one in   
 the milking parlour and one in the    
 main office.The one in the milking    
 parlour controls the exact amount of  
 food each cow should be given and the 
 one in the office keeps a record of   
 the history of each animal.They have  
 worked out that it costs 6p to feed   
 one cow on grass per day.They also    
 feed the cattle a special "cake" which
 costs Â£200 for 1000kg.                
   Technology also helps to keep the   
 milk clean because the teat cups      
 automatically stop working if they    
 fall off into the dirt.The milk is    
 stored in 3 big tanks,each holding    
 2600litres,and is collected by Wootton
 Bassett dairy.There are 222 cows      
 altogether and 1 Holstein bull.They   
 have been limited by EEC milk quotas. </content>
