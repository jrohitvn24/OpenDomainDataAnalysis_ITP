		<title>11ROAD SAFETY IN THE SUBURBS</title>
		<content>  In recent years there has been an    
{enormous increase}in the traffic using
 the roads around Hatherley.For        
 instance a{fourfold}increase in       
 traffic passing Lakeside School since 
 the late sixties.                     
  Since 1980 several{serious accidents 
 have happened,mostly involving young  
 people.In 1984 a cyclist was killed   
 near the school and in 1983 another   
 very seriously injured.Over a three   
 year period 36 children from the local
 secondary school were injured in road 
 accidents.                            
  The police and road safety officers  
 have tried to solve the problem but so
 far with little success.The class     
 consider that there are two main      
 causes,{cars are driven much too fast 
 and{young cyclists use the roads in a 
{very dangerous way.
