		<title>13GRANGE FARM VISIT.</title>
		<content> ONE WET TUESDAY WE VISITED A FARM.    
 SHELTERING IN THE SHED WE ASKED OUR   
 QUESTIONS. THEN WE SAW A THIRTY YEAR  
 OLD FERGUSON {TRACTOR}. WE COMPARED IT
 WITH THE NEWEST JOHN DEERE, COMPLETE  
 WITH PADDED SEATS AND RADIO. FARMER   
 JOHN GROWS WHEAT, BARLEY, SUGAR       
 BEET, POTATOES AND OATS. SCARECROWS   
 ARE {SCARCE}, BUT A GAS GUN (WORKING  
 ON A TIME SWITCH) FRIGHTENS THE BIRDS 
 AWAY. THE PIG UNIT HAD ONE{ BOAR},    
 SEVERAL SOWS AND SIXTY-SIX PIGLETS.   
 GARETH WONDERED WHETHER THIS COULD BE 
 CALLED {BIGAMY!} THERE WERE PENS OF   
 PORKERS BEING FATTENED FOR MARKET.    
 THEY WERE TO BE KEPT FOR TWENTY WEEKS 
 AND THEN SENT TO THE BUTCHERS OR CURED
 FOR HAM. THE FARMER MADE USE OF HIS   
 DEGREE FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY; A   
 GOOD EDUCATION WAS USEFUL. THE FARMER 
 ENJOYED HIS WORK,ESPECIALLY GATHERING 
 IN THE {HARVEST}.                     </content>
