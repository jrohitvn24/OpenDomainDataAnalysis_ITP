 The church was founded in Norman times
 but was rebuilt after a serious fire  
 in 1897. The west tower, dating from  
 the 13th century, and the Cavendish   
 Chapel, built in 1624, survived the   
 fire. In the churchyard is a grave    
 with a spelling mistake. On the       
 gravestone it says 'in loviny memorg'.

 One of the pubs in the Market Place   
 dates from Tudor times. It was        
 originally a house in which Courts    
 Leet and Courts Baron were held. The  
 old pub sign was a carving in an oak  
 beam. The newer sign is of the same   
 design but made out of cast iron. The 
 Tudor style windows still remain.
