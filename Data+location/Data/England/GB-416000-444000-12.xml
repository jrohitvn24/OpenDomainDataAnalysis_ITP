		<content> It is quite likely that Burley-in-    
 Wharfedale was once a Roman out-post, 
 and that there was a Saxon settlement 
 there before that. Burley remained    
 almost unchanged for centuries until  
 the cotton industry came to the area. 
 The mill was worked almost entirely by
 children sent down from London. In the
 1850 the old mill was demolished, and 
 the present buildings erected, and    
 also the mill school was founded. It  
 was the first one of it's kind.

 King Athelstan defeated the Danes at  
 Brunanburgh and granted the Manor of  
 Otley to Archbishop Wulfstan of York. 
   MENSTON-Today,the only evidence of  
 the earliest habitation on the moors  
 south of Menston are cup and ring     
 markings and stone circles.In the 19th
 century Menston was an industrial town</content>
