		<content>  From the time of the Domesday Book   
 to about 150 years ago, little had    
 changed.At the time of the Industrial 
 Revolution,many left the country and  
 moved into the towns.The rich people  
 set up large estates,like Possingworth
 Manor, which gave work to many people.
 People lived and worked around the    
 village.Sometimes people had to walk 7
 or 8 miles to work.They took the      
 shortest routes and made some of the  
 footpaths we have today. Few places   
 had electricity,water was pumped from 
 wells,butter was churned and crops    
 were cut and chopped by hand. Due to  
 problems,estates began to break up and
 workers rented land for their own use.
 After the First World War,factories   
 made more machines and farmers only   
 needed a few workers.Food came in     
 from abroad and farms became derelict.
