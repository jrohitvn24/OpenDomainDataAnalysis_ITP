		<title>15LOCAL PERSON - REDHILL</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Hatt}moved to{Redhill}in{l924,  
 when he was 7 years old.  He now lives
 at 80, Wray Park Road.  He went to St.
 Matthew's School until he was l4 years
 old &amp; remembers milk &amp; coal being     
 delivered to the local houses by horse
 &amp; cart, &amp; fire engines also being     
 pulled by horses.                     
   Reigate &amp; Redhill were {very quiet }
 in those days.  Many of the big houses
 still survive today but have been     
 converted into flats.  Mr. Hatt can   
 remember eating more porridge, fried  
 bread &amp; fresh vegetables as a boy.    
   During the{Second World War,}Mr.    
 Hatt was away fighting but he can     
 remember being home on leave when the 
 soldiers returned from Dunkirk.  He   
 told us about the bomb which fell at  
 Shaws Corner causing much damage.  He 
 says fun as a family was better as    
 there were less distractions.         </content>
