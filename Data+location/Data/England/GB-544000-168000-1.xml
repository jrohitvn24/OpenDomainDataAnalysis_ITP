		<content>The area covered by our D-block has    
undergone extensive development in the 
post war period.Open spaces have been  
gradually built upon and so residential
areas have grown.It is a part of the   
"commuter land" around London,with a   
large number of people travelling into 
the City to work.                      
The people who live in this area have  
the best of both worlds.London and its 
attractions are only a short train ride
away and the services into the City are
frequent.Yet the countryside is right  
on the doorstep and a short car or bus 
ride can take you away from the bustle 
of town life.                          
The schools that compiled the          
information on this part of the outer  
London suburbs,offer it as an insight  
to the area to those who are           
interested.
