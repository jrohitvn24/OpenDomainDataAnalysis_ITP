		<title>05EAST WITT. SCHOOL FIELD</title>
		<content>   We are lucky to have school field.  
 Our class have been finding out some  
 facts about it.It is roughly a        
 rectangle in shape,and it measures    
 129 metres long and 90 metres wide.One
 day this summer,we went out to find as
 many plants as we could.We were       
 surprised at how many we found.There  
 were buttercups,speedwell,cut-leaved  
 cranesbill,field bindweed,scarlet     
 pimpernel,self-heal,and many more.    
   Most of these plants like a soil    
 which is rich in nitrogen.In the old  
 days,cows used to graze on this field,
 so it has probably not been cultivated
 for many,many years.There are very few
 trees in the Witterings,and this is   
 reflected in there only being a few   
 around the field - Sorbus,Walnut,     
 Prunus and a Pink Hawthorn.
