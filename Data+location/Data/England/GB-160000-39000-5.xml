		<content> Rosewarne Experimental Horticulture   
 Station is part of the Agricultural   
 Development and Advisory Service of   
 the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries 
 and food and specialises in research  
 appropriate to South-Western          
 England.Much of the work at Rosewarne 
 is concerned with the staple crops of 
 this area particularly winter         
 cauliflower. Varieties have been      
 interbred to produce early crops and  
 many experiments have been done to    
 find out the best growing conditions  
 for the vegetable. At present there is
 an experiment in pollination and cross
 pollination using bees and flies in   
 plastic containers.Another crop which 
 is given great attention at Rosewarne 
 is the tomato. They are experimenting 
 with various methods of growing       
 tomatoes including rockwall,and       
 methods of fertilisation.             </content>
