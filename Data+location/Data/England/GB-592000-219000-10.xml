		<content>  The{fete}opens and you can buy a     
 Lucky Programme at the gate for 10p   
 which could win you 5 pounds. At the  
 gate you will see the huge crane, the 
 main attraction of the day. It carries
 you high above the village in its     
 bucket and gives{magnificent views.   
 There are lots of side shows like Mr  
 Big Mouth where you have to throw a   
 ping pong ball into a mouth shape. You
 can also have a lucky dip and pull a  
 prize out of a tub. Other{side shows  
 are Tombolla stall, books, a jumping  
 castle, throwing a welly. You can have
 pony rides and buy ice creams, teas   
 and candy floss.                      
  Many children enter the Fancy Dress  
 Competition and bring along their pets
 for a show. The winners get money and 
 rosettes. There is a dancing display. 
 What a lovely way to raise 550 pounds 
 for our school.                       </content>
