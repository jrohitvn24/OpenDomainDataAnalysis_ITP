		<title>16HADLEIGH BYPASS</title>
		<content>  When the Bypass was finished the     
grass verges had to be sown with a     
special grass and wild flower seed     
mixture. This was done because the     
people of Hadleigh had been worried    
about the loss of wild plants when the 
road was built.Now the grass and plants
have grown the area looks much better. 
  Beside the Bypass, on what used to be
Aldham Common, is a memorial to        
Dr.Rowland Taylor.Dr.Rowland Taylor was
a Rector of Hadleigh and was burnt at  
the stake here in 1555.                
  During the time of 15 minutes at     
1.30p.m. on a June day we recorded the 
flow of traffic:                       
Lorries: 10         Cars: 56           
Vans: 12            Other: 2           
The bypass was quite busy and the      
traffic was travelling at fairly high  
speeds.                                
                                       </content>
