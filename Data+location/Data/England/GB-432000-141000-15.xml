 Primary School is the local school for
 the Abbotts Ann district. The Church  
 of England, through the Parochial     
 Church Council, has representation on 
 the governing body.                   
     The present school building was   
 erected in 1905 replacing an earlier  
 school which was burnt down. There are
 67 children aged between 5 and 11 at  
 the school. The staff is a Headmaster,
 2 full-time and 2 part-time teachers. 
     The school stands on a small      
 playground and has three classrooms.  
 The toilets are in a separate block on
 one side of the playground. The 3 acre
 school field lies on another site. The
 Village Hall across the road is used  
 for P.E.                              
     The equipment in the school       
 includes: 1 BBC computer, a television
