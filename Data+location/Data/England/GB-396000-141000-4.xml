		<content>{Church of England.}All that remains of
 St. Mary's Church is its Chancel. A   
 Holy Communion Service is held at nine
 o'clock on the third Sunday of each   
 month from April to October. Winter   
 Services are not held as there is no  
 heating. Up to 30th June, 1985, the   
 Rev. R. F. Dossetor, M.A., Priest-in- 
 Charge of Tilshead, Orcheston and     
 Chitterne officiated at the Services. 
 Since his retirement there has been an
 interregnum and Services have been    
 taken by visiting, usually retired,   
 clergy. The congregation ranges from  
 eight or nine to about twenty five.   
 The Chancel begins to feel crowded    
 when more than twenty five people are 
 present!                              
{Baptists.}The Chapel remains, but has 
 been closed for worship for many      
 years. Monthly informal services are  
 held in the village hall.             </content>
