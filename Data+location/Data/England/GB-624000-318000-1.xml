		<title>01Introduction to the Area</title>
		<content> The survey rectangle is 6 miles to the
 North of Norwich and 12 miles from the
 Norfolk coast.                        
                                       
  It is predominately an agricultural  
 area where large arable fields often  
 surrounded by hedges, are occasionally
 interrupted by small patches of       
 woodland.                             
                                       
  The terrain is gently undulating but 
 slopes fairly steeply to the NE to the
 valley bottom of the River Bure. The  
 river valley is a major influence on  
 the siting of roads, railways (now    
 closed) and the twin villages of      
 Horstead and Coltishall. These        
 villages are the centres of population
 in the survey rectangle.              
  Elsewhere isolated hamlets and houses
 exist.                                
                                       </content>
