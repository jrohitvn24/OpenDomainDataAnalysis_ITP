		<title>11Buxhall - The Thatcher</title>
		<content> The local thatcher began thatching in 
 1969 as an apprentice. He is a member 
 of the{Suffolk Master Thatchers Assoc-
{iation,}which aims to maintain the    
 best traditional standards of         
 thatching in East Anglia. His business
 is run with a partner and "apprentice"
 although he generally works by himself
 anywhere in Suffolk up to 70km from   
 home.                                 
 Half the work is complete rethatching,
 the remainder is repair. He harvests  
 all the materials used -{reeds}from   
 Norfolk, and{straw}locally using a    
 sail-reaper.{Broatches,}for pegging   
 the straw, and{liggers,}for the       
 decoration on the capping, are made   
 from{osiers or nuttery}(hazel) both   
 gathered locally. He thatches all year
 but dislikes heavy rain and cannot    
 work in severe frost or snow. Then he 
 can make his tools and equipment.     </content>
