		<title>15TRANSPORT &amp; COMMUNICATIONS</title>
		<content> The only modes of transport are by    
 private car or bike. There is a bus   
 service along the A453,in the bottom  
 right hand corner between Ashby       
 &amp; Breedon. The bus services to the    
 nearest towns are at Ticknall &amp;       
 Melbourne, from where the fare to     
 Derby is about Â£1.50. Burton &amp; Derby  
 are about 16-24 kilometres away.      
 Most houses in the area have a        
 telephone, &amp; all have electricity but 
 no gas. Most dwellings do not have    
 mains drainage. Electricity pylons can
 be seen running from  N to S on the E 
 side of the area.A water pipeline     
 flows W to E from Staunton Harold     
 reservoir, pumping water into         
 Leicestershire; inspection chambers   
 can be seen along its length.         
 During bad winters,the roads do become
 difficult to travel along, but it is  
 unusual for the area to be cut off.   </content>
