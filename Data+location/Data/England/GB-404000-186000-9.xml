		<title>09Bee-Keeping In Braydon</title>
		<content> A farmer in Braydon enjoys bee-keeping
 as a hobby. Starting from one hive, he
 now has 17 hives. Surplus honey is    
 sold to local customers.              
    Bee-keepers feed the bees with     
 sugar water syrup to stimulate them in
 April. The hives are visited every 9  
 days during the summer for the purpose
 of swarm control. Protective clothing 
 of veil, gloves and trousers is worn. 
 The honey is collected during August. 
 The bees are fed again in September   
 and then left until the following     
 Spring when the cycle starts again.   
    In Braydon the bees would feed     
 primarily on clover. This wet and cool
 summer of 1985 has been disastrous for
 clover as temperatures of 21 C are    
 required from June to July.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
