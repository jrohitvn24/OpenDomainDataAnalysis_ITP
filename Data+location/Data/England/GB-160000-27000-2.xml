		<title>02THE HISTORY OF ASHTON</title>
		<content> The original name of the village was {
{Ashdown.}Local legend states that a   
 line of ash trees originally stretched
 long the road from Helston to         
 Penzance. Timber was required for pit 
 props in the local mineral mines and  
 these trees were cut down for use in  
 the mines, hence its old name Ashdown.
 The centre of the present village is  
 still on the site where two ancient   
 trackways crossed.                    
                                       
       Before motor transport two horse
 buses served the area, one being run  
 by a Mr Jenkins who drove his bus from
 Helston to Penzance. The bus was      
 pulled by four horses who remained    
 unchanged along the fourteen mile     
 route. The other bus ran between      
 Porthleven and Ashton.
