		<content>{The borough}is split into 13 wards and
 there are 39 councillors who meet as a
 body every 2 months, but are split to 
 form 5 or 6 departments or committees 
 which meet more regularly. The council
 is led by the Mayor.                  
{People}are generally happy with the   
 council but on questioning found it   
 hard to identify the mayor let alone  
 any councillors. Roads and street     
 lighting appear to be the major       
 complaints, closely followed by town  
 centre parking.                       
{Many people}thought that the new      
 shopping centre was killing the       
 traditional shops on the High Street. 
{For the future}a number of people felt
 that youth clubs and nurseries were   
 most needed.
