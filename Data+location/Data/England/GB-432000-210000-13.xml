The Street has neat rows of cottages an
goes up the hill from the Swan.Some    
cottages have slate roofs.The slate    
comes from a nearby village called     
Stonesfield.There is a pub on the      
corner called the Old Swan.There are no
shops.There used to be a post office   
but now it is a private home and so is 
the smithie.The walls of the houses    
are made of stone.Minster Lovell Hall  
and the church are at the top of The   
Sreet and the River Windrush runs      
behind it on the right hand side.
