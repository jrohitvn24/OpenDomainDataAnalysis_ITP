		<title>11The Local Natural Habitat</title>
		<content>   The trees of our area are mostly    
 deciduous with some evergreens. They  
 are mixed with; oaks, chesnuts and    
 beech. In these trees the many        
 inhabitants include the green         
 woodpecker and the grey squirrel. The 
 green woodpecker, like the grey       
 squirrel likes deciduous trees to     
 build her nest.                       
    We have a network of streams       
 of which{Cattley}brook is one . It    
 swirls down through a series of ponds 
 and into the river{Derwent.}It is a   
 very popular place with the           
 watervoles. They come to the brook to 
 catch fish,frogs and newts. Also they 
 will suck up spawn of any kind and    
 will eat any available insects.       
   The trees by the brook are mostly   
 Sycamore, Chesnuts and Oaks which     
 drink water from the moist ground so  
 that they thrive better there.        </content>
