		<content> Epsom Common is perhaps best known as 
 the site of The Wells, famous in the  
 seventeenth century as the source of  
 Epsom Salts.  Houses now occupy the   
 site of the old Wells but the common  
 is maintained in its natural state,   
 with only sufficient management to    
 stop any deterioration of the habitat.
                                       
 Epsom Common must have a lot of       
 wildlife in the woodlands.There must  
 be lots of birds for instance the Blue
 Tit,the Woodpecker,the Wren,the       
 Blackbird,the Sparrow,the Magpie and  
 the Thrush.                           
                                       
 When we visited the common we saw     
 thousands of baby frogs making their  
 way across the paths near the Stew    
 Pond.  Many of these were killed by   
 people walking along the paths.
