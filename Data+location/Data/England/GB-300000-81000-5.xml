		<content> I wake up about seven o'clock I go    
 down stairs have my breakfast which is
 usually Frosties and toast.Then I go  
 upstairs have a wash and get dressed. 
 My school uniform for winter is a grey
 skirt, white blouse a tie that is blue
 with silver stripes.My summer uniform 
 is a blue and white check dress and   
 blue cardigan.Then I pack my bag get  
 my shoes on and go to school.When I   
 get to Brixington Junior School I go  
 in at 9.00.I am in Mr Holland's class 
 with 29 other children aged 10.School 
 Assembly is at 10.20.The rest of the  
 day is spent working except for the   
 lunch break which is from 12 to 1.15  
 when I eat my sandwiches. When I get  
 home from school I get changed and    
 practice my clarinet, then go out to  
 play, but if I have got homework I    
 have to stay in and do it. Then I have
 tea and watch TV until bedtime at 9.00</content>
