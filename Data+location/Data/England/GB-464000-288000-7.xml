		<title>07Farming in the Mowsley Area</title>
		<content>  Of the dozen farms in our D-block,   
 about half are farmed by the owners,  
 the others by tenant farmers.Much of  
 the land is under{permanent pasture   
 for grazing by sheep or cattle.The    
 predominant breeds of cattle are      
 Herefords,&amp; Friesians,while sheep are 
 mainly Mule Masham or Cross Suffolk.  
  Some farmers rotate pasture land with
 silage.{Crops}include oats,wheat,beans
 and oil-seed rape.Many of the fields  
 have copses or coverts, presumably    
 these find favour with the local hunt.
  Interesting{field names}are Bargles, 
 Troopers Meadow,Carpenters Close,Top  
 Close,and several are named Cricket   
 Field.The Charity field in Laughton,is
 rented to local people,the income from
 it going to the poor of Laughton.     
  All the local markets are used by    
 farmers.Leicester,Melton Mowbray,     
 Market Harborough,Kettering &amp; Rugby.  </content>
