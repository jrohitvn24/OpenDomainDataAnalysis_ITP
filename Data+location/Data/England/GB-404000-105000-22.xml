In August 2010 35 Angus Cattle and six New Forest ponies were reintroduced to this land, a National Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by the National Trust and Natural England to keep the gorse and other plants under control.They are hoping to re-create Egdon Heath from Thomas Hardy's novels.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are road grids at each end of the roads and a 40mph limit. They have fenced off some parts of the land beside the road and from farm land. The main part of the area is open and in spite of the 40mph limit some animals have been killed or injured especially at night when it is difficult to see them wandering in the road.Although members of the public held a meeting to discuss the situation the animals are to stay and will wear reflective collars.&lt;br />&lt;br />Permission to graze the heath was given in 2006.&lt;br />&lt;br />There used to be what the maps call a Bee Garden on a small piece of land behind the houses called Four Acres and Gorselands.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
