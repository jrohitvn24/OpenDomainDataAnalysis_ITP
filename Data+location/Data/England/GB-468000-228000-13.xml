		<title>13CONSERVATION IN PADBURY</title>
		<content> Most of Padbury is a conservation area
 so extra care is taken when anyone    
 seeks planning permission to build or 
 alter a house. The Parish Council's   
 views are always sought on planning   
 matters, although the "powers that be"
 in Aylesbury do sometimes go against  
 the advice of the Parish councillors. 
 Generally speaking planning permission
 is granted for houses to be built on  
 derelict sites or waste ground. A good
 example of this is the building of 17 
 houses on the site of the former      
 railway station and yard. The end     
 result satisfies most people but there
 was considerable local opposition in  
 the beginning. However it has proved  
 much more difficult to obtain planning
 permission for infilling on green     
 field sites. The older villagers think
 each field lost is one too many.
