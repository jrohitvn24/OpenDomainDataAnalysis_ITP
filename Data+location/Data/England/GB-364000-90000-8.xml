		<title>08  Town Hill Farm.</title>
		<content>   Town Hill farm , where I live, is   
 one of seven farms owned              
 W.N.Chick &amp; sons.Four people work on  
 the farm, not including my dad who    
 manages five farms.                   
   Our farm has sheep, oats, barley,   
 corn, wheat and cows. The cows give   
 their milk to calves and are not      
 milked commercially.                  
   We grow grass for silage. This is   
 rotted grass which cattle relish.     
   March and April is lambing time. The
 sheep are brought into a large barn.  
 Some have singles and twins and some  
 have triplets and occasionally the    
 sheep have quadruplets. A record has  
 to be kept on the lambing.            
   Cereal stalks go to make straw for  
 bedding. Hay is used for food all year
 round.
