		<title>09 ST NICHOLAS CHURCH TOWER</title>
		<content> On top of the church tower is a needle
steeple covered in lead.It was once a  
sea-mark so Trinity House paid towards 
its repair.The tower has battlements &amp; 
a turret staircase,it dates from about 
1500.There are 111 steps in the tower. 
The first room we came to was where you
ring the bells from.We were allowed to 
ring the bells and use the hand-bells. 
In the next room you can see the clock 
workings.In the next room are the bells
there are 10 of them the bellringers   
practise every Friday.From the top of  
the tower you can see for miles.We saw 
the weather vane,it has a bullet hole  
in it from a German plane in the war.  
There is an acorn made of wood covered 
with copper which usually sits on the  
vane rod.It has just been repaired and 
is inside the church.We all touched it 
while we could before it is replaced.Mr
Barlow,The Vicar,showed us around.     </content>
