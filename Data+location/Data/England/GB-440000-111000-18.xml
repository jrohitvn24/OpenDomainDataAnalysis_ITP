		<title>18International Ferry Terminal</title>
		<content> The international ferry terminal has  
 been in use since the early sixties.  
 On the quay there are warehouses for  
 cargo. The P &amp; O ferries have         
 frequently used the Princess          
 Alexandria dock.                      
   There is an old railway line which  
 runs through the quays which was at   
 one time used to distribute cargo to  
 the port's warehouses.                
   The warehouses have been renovated  
 since the war and are still in use.   
 The docks have been rebuilt in parts: 
 there are new car ramps and the quay  
 has been renewed.                     
   The Itchen area consists mainly of  
 public houses, warehouses and works.  
 There is a major development scheme   
 for the area beneath the Itchen       
 Bridge. The waters of the river are   
 green and muddy.
