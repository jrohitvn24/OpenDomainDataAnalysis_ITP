People living in the Community enjoy   
their rural surroundings, and are very 
concerned with ecology and             
conservation. They guard their         
footpaths and Bridleways, which are    
properly marked and used.  The weather 
and its effect on crops and farming is 
of major importance.  Commuters,       
because of their gardens are also      
weather conscious, gardening being the 
main hobby of most residents.          
Communal activities include:-          
Women's Institute, Scouts, Cubs,       
Brownies, Guides, Gardening Guild and  
Venture Scouts. The meeting place for  
these activities is in the Village Hall
which is in  the adjoining survey      
block. Farming topics dominate         
conversation when groups meet with     
current affairs being of secondary     
importance.                            </content>
