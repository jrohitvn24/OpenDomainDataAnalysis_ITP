		<title>14A BOURNE SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content>   {My}alarm wakes me at an early hour 
 and I get up and brace myself for the 
 day ahead. I am thirteen years old and
 study at Bourne Grammar School which, 
 like any other school day, starts with
 breakfast and my friend calling for   
 me, on her bicycle, at about 8.40.    
   {Lessons}begin after registration   
 and usually go quite well. The best   
 part of the day is when we go into our
 canteen for lunch, with a constant    
 murmur of people discussing their     
 morning's work. Lessons include Maths.
 English,Sciences,French,Humanities.   
   {When}afternoon lessons are over it 
 is usually all "hurly-burly" in the   
 bicycle sheds as pupils try to hurry  
 home to get on with their homework.   
 The radio and a drink are the first   
 things I need. After tea I relax in   
 front of the television with a bag of 
 crisps and then to bed.               </content>
