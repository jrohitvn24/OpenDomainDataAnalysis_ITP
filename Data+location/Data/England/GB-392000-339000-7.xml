		<title>07A BUILDER'S DAY</title>
		<content>My Dad gets up at 6.30.am.He dresses   
and goes downstairs.He has a cup of    
tea and something to eat for breakfast.
Then he makes all his phone calls and  
opens the bills before he goes to      
houses to do estimates for new work.   
After that he goes to Finney's build-  
er's yard in Blythe Bridge.He meets his
work mates and they plan their work.   
When they have finished they start to  
dig the foundations and level the      
ground.At 12 they have dinner.After    
that they start building again until 6 
but Dad goes to see other houses so    
that he can see what people want him to
build.Then he comes home, has tea and  
starts doing bills, drawing plans or   
doing estimates.He watches TV then at  
10 goes upstairs to bed.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
