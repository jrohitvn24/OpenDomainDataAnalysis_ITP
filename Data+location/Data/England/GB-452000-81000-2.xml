		<content> FARMING_GREAT BUDBRIDGE   MANOR.      
 Great Budbridge Manor is situated in  
 the north west corner of our area.    
 Built mainly of stone, with some      
 brick, it is largely 17th century,    
 though may have earlier origins, as is
 evidenced by a low arched door on the 
 west facing side.The frontage is that 
 of a typical small manor house, double
 fronted with a porch with rooms above.
 The upper windows are mullioned.The   
 lower windows have been replaced and  
 the mullions removed, possibly earlier
 this century.Like the owners of many  
 of the manors on the island, those of 
 Great Budbridge have turned the land  
 to commercial use. In this case, 3    
 acres of commercial greenhouses have  
 been erected, in which 30,000 tomato  
 plants are grown annually.The tomatoes
 are sent to all parts of Gt.Britain.
