		<title>16Water Supply</title>
		<content> A good supply  of water was always a  
 major consideration when establishing 
 a dwelling or a settlement.For example
 at Truscott we saw a pond which we    
 think was used for water supply.      
 Another water supply is the           
 well.People in the old days had to    
 take a bucket to the well to get their
 own water.At Langore for example      
 people fetched their water from one of
 eight wells in the village.Langore was
 connected to mains water supply       
 between 1958 and 1963.All other       
 dwellings are on mains water supply   
 but we saw old wells at Newmills,     
 Hendragreen and Truscott.Sometimes we 
 have water shortages and we have to   
 use water wisely.The River Kensey     
 never dries up completly though it has
 been known to flood surrounding       
 farmland.Fishing is a popular passtime
 especially with some children.        </content>
