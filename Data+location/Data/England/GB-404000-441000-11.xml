		<title>11KEIGHLEY FEAST WEEK</title>
		<content>    For the last 150-200 years Keighley
 has had two weeks holiday around      
 June/July.                            
    Feast Week was originally for      
 maintaining machinery in the mills and
 factories.  The Keighley people took  
 their holidays in their Feast weeks.  
 Today some of the larger firms still  
 close down for two weeks.  Schools are
 closed for the last week inJune.      
    A survey of local travel agents    
 showed that the majority of Keighley  
 people still take their holidays in   
 the Feast weeks.  The second most     
 popular time is the September break,  
 another traditional holiday in the    
 area.                                 
    Recently efforts have been made to 
 change school holidays to the normal  
 pattern, with no break in June.       
 However local feeling has been against
 this.  Tradition lives on!            </content>
