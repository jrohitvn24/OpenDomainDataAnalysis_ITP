		<title>04Our Old Caretaker</title>
		<content> Mrs.North has lived in the schoolhouse
 since 1939.When she first came to live
 in Cheriton she had no electricity or 
 outside toilet.                       
        Mrs.North has three            
 children,eleven grandchildren and five
 great grandchildren.                  
        Her job was quite different    
 from Mrs.Ford's,our present caretaker.
 She had to pump water for the school  
 every morning from the well,fill and  
 light paraffin lamps,chop             
 firewood,light fires and carry heavy  
 coal scuttles to keep them going.     
       The school kitchen used to be   
 her garden room and during the        
 1939-1945 war evacuees from Portsmouth
 lived there.                          
       Her husband was a bricklayer and
 worked at Freemans just behind the    
 school.                               
                                       </content>
