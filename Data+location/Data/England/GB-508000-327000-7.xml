		<content> In the past many{customs}were         
 observed. Among the most important    
 were a butter market;an annual        
 Temperance Club fete, which was a     
 holiday,with dancing to concertinas in
 the Manor Barn;and Oak Apple Day when,
 if one failed to sport an oak leaf,one
 was stung on the legs by boys with    
 nettles.Empire Day meant singing      
 patriotic songs and saluting the      
 Flag.On Plough Monday farm workers    
 became Mummers in return for          
 refreshment.Foxhunting and bellringing
 survive as does the May Queen ceremony
 now held during the July{Feast weekend
 which is celebrated with fancy dress, 
 brass bands,coconut shies,decorated   
 prams and bikes and various activities
 in the village hall.The{Harvest Supper
 is still held,not by the Lord of the  
 Manor,but as a well attended,all      
 ticket affair,in the village hall.    </content>
