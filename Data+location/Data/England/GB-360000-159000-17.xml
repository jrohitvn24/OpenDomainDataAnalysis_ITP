		<title>17CLUTTON SCHOOL TODAY</title>
		<content>   The present school population is 147
 pupils and Headmaster plus 6 teachers.
 The oldest child is Jody Probert who  
 was 11 in September and the youngest  
 is Jessica Beeson who will be 5 in    
 August. We asked some of the children 
 in each class what they  like best and
 least about school. Wayne (11)liked   
 football, cricket and swimming best.  
 He did not like maths. Dean (5) liked 
 making models and maths but hee does  
 not like writing. Natalie(8) liked    
 project  work but does not like       
 writing stories because they take too 
 long. The part of school life that    
 most children did not like is school  
 assemblies. Most liked P.E.           
 Thechildren who are leaving this year 
 were asked for their memories of the  
 school. They had all enjoyed school   
 camp at Exmouth.They had enjoyed being
 members of teams and meeting children.</content>
