		<title>05HOUSING IN TEDDINGTON</title>
		<content>   The area to the{south of Teddington 
{centre is mainly housing.  Queen's    
{Road}is used as a by-pass route around
 the centre and{Park Road}is the main  
 street south from the railway bridge. 
 Both{are busy,}especially during the  
 rush hour{but off them are a number of
{peaceful residential streets.} Most of
{the houses are semi-detached and}were 
 built during the{late Edwardian       
 period.                               
  {Off Queen's Road}and behind the main
 street{are 12 blocks of flats. }These 
 were{built in the 1960's-1970's.      
 Several of the{roads in the immediate 
{vicinity of the station were developed
 when the railway came to Teddington in
{the middle of the 19th. century}and   
 these have royal names from that age: 
 Albert, Adelaide, Clarence and        
 Victoria Roads.
