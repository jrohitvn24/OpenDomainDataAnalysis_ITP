		<title>14FIRBECK HOME WATCH SCHEME</title>
		<content> Years ago people got worried because  
 they had a lot of robberies.So they   
 phoned the police man and he phoned   
 the station in{Maltby}and they        
 organisd a meeting.Five policemen     
 came.So they thought of having a Home 
 Watch Scheme.So all the people decided
 to do that.They were all divided into 
 different parts of{Firbeck.}There were
 7 parts of the village.Mrs Stocks is  
 a member of the scheme and also she is
 a co_ordinator.Most of the people     
 who live in Firbeck are at work in the
 day so people  take it in turns to    
 watch people's houses.One time a      
 bird hit a burglar alarm and it went  
 off. There are 14 co-ordinators in the
 scheme. They have had no burglaries   
 since the scheme started.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
