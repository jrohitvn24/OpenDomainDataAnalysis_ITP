		<title>12Our area of Ipswich</title>
		<content>Our family has always lived in Ipswich.
We are close to the town with parks and
shops as well as a Sports Centre. We   
cannot think of any disadvantages of   
living here, because we have all we    
need.  My mum says she would like to   
see a playgroup for young children. We 
only have a sports centre close by at  
Maidenhall but it would be nice for the
school to open up in the evenings for  
indoor sports. Belstead is a nice place
with lots to do.  There are schools    
close by with a clinic, library and    
also ladies and gents hairdressers. We 
have a good bus service. There are two 
large hotels in the area for people    
passing through.  We are also close to 
the A12.
