		<title>11Doodle Bug on Dedworth cont.</title>
		<content> "It's all right Sal" said my father in
 a very worried voice, still pedalling 
 along. The Doodle Bug grew smaller and
 lower into the distance. The sight of 
 the swings dispelled my fears as the  
 noise grew fainter and  I tugged my   
 father' coat asking for a ride. My    
 words were lost and never heard amidst
 the terrific bang which shook the     
 ground beneath us. Sheer  terror      
 gripped me as I clung to my father who
 just stopped pedalling. I thought the 
 world had stopped especially when my  
 father said nothing. Then as if       
 someone had turned on a switch once   
 more we were pedalling again, but with
 urgent haste this time. As we zoomed  
 along doing twice our previous pace   
 there was a big column of smoke. I    
 realised something terrible had       
 happened and my Dad was needed as he  
 was and Air Raid Warden.              </content>
