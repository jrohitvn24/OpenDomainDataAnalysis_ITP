		<content>   The redways are paths for cyclists  
 and pedestrians only which run        
 throughout Milton Keynes.They are made
 of red tarmac.                        
   Whilst on the redways you may       
 need to cross the road.To help you do 
 this there are underpasses,bridges and
 bollards.The bollards are yellow posts
 that warn you there is a road ahead   
   In 1980 there was 150 kilometres of 
 redways running through Milton Keynes,
 but now much more has been built.     
   On the redways there are signs to   
 direct you.They have green backgrounds
 and white letters.                    
   The redways are much safer than     
 riding on the roads.You have to watch 
 out for pedestrians walking on the    
 redways and broken glass lying        
 around,although they are cleaned      
 regularly.
