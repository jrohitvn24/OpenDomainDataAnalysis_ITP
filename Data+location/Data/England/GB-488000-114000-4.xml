		<title>04MORE DOWNLAND PLANTS</title>
		<content>    Grass grows freely along the paths 
 &amp; rides of the downs &amp; the chalk      
 contains many plants typical of       
 lowland pastures as well as its own   
 distinctive species.                  
    Downland grasses in this block are:
 Ribwort plantain, Creeping Red Fescue,
 Cocksfoot, Tufted Sheep's Fescue,     
 Sedge &amp; Quaking grass.  Taller grasses
 include Upright Brome, which shields  
 butterflies &amp; grasshoppers from their 
 enemies, &amp; Common &amp; Downy Oatgrass.   
 Without grazing the coarse grasses:-  
 Tor grass, False oat, Timothy, Fiorin 
 &amp; Cosksfoot spread &amp; smother flowers. 
    Heyshott Down is one of the very   
 special sites where mosses can still  
 be found.  One species is Feathermoss 
 which gives grazed downland turf a    
 spongy carpet-pile feel.  Chalk land  
 is not rich in fungi &amp; only puff balls
 &amp; Clitocybe Nebularis were found.     </content>
