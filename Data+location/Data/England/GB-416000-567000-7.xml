		<content>   Westerhope First School has a staff 
 of forty seven,of which fourteen are  
 teachers. There are two hundred       
 and forty seven children in the main  
 school and fifty nine in the nursery. 
   Westerhope First School was formed  
 because Beaumont and West Park were   
 next to each other and had too few    
 pupils. Mrs Dix,the headteacher,      
 thinks the merger went well. She says 
 the pupils have reacted very well to  
 it.                                   
   Money given to the school would help
 to buy books and repair the old       
 buildings. Mrs Dix said that it would 
 be good to have a sports hall.        
 Mrs Dix said that she likes teaching  
 the children but dosn't like          
 organising repairs etc.
