		<title>13SOME IMPORTANT BUILDINGS.</title>
		<content> We made a list of the buildings we    
 thought were important in the town. We
 were surprised at how many there were.
 What is now the{Town Clock}was first  
 a reservoir (since 1862) where people 
 came to get their water. The Clock was
 added in 1903. We have a{library, post
{office, police station, youth and     
{community centre, fire station, three 
{clubs, two railway stations, two      
{lifeboat houses, the Little Theatre,  
{the old lifeboat shed (now a craft    
{centre), and three halls.} Less       
 important but very interesting are the
 surviving flint{fishermen's cottages, 
 the old{shepherd's cottages}on Beeston
 Common and the Victorian{boarding     
{houses}in Morris Street. Some{two     
{storeyed wash-houses}remain, the down 
 stairs contained the copper and mangle
 and upstairs by wooden ladder is where
 children slept when visitors came.    </content>
