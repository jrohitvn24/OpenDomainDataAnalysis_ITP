		<content> We undertook a survey of families in  
 one class asking about the use of     
{leisure facilities.}                  
                                       
 Two thirds of those who answered went 
 swimming every week. Others went to   
 weight training, roller skating, keep 
 fit, badminton and gymnastics. The    
 first two of these being the most     
 popular.Most people were satisfied    
 with the facilities and prices.       
{Public Houses.}                       
 Witham has 16 public houses.Most of   
 them are in Newland Street reflecting 
 Witham's importance as a coaching town
 in the 18th and 19th centuries.       
  In the sample, 50% of the families   
 used a pub in Witham sometimes, a     
 majoritory thought that there were too
 many pubs, and the same number said   
 that they would use them more if there
 was a children's room for them to use.</content>
