		<title>04Sleap Airfield Farm</title>
		<content> Sleap Airfield Farm is owned by Mr.   
 Bromley and has only 20 acres         
 on a central site with some more acres
 being away from these. The animals    
 kept are beef cattle, cows and        
 calves. The farm grows grass for      
 silage and hay, and some oil seed     
 rape. A compound fetilizer is used to 
 improve the soil, as is animal manure.
 The present farmer has one part-time  
 helper and gets up at 7 o'clock,      
 retiring to bed at about 11           
 o'clock.The farm buildings are about  
 one hundred years old although the    
 present owner has only lived there for
 14 years. Cattle are sold at          
 Shrewsbury market but are not taken to
 shows.The farmer most enjoys feeding  
 the stock.
