		<title>16 AYNHO C.E. SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The village school is closing down  
on 12th. July,1985 because there are   
only 12 children aged 4-11yrs. From    
September, Aynho children will attend  
Charlton C.E. School. In 1980 there    
were about 35 children but since the   
numbers have dropped, there is now only
1 full-time teacher.                   
   Founded as a church school in 1813, 
and housed in an old barn, the school  
is off The Square. and has a playground
orchard, and garden.                   
  For the past few years Games and     
Swimming have been taken with Croughton
School. Many visits have been made to  
different places like Snowdonia, Isle  
of Wight, London and the canals.       
   During the week teachers   visit to 
take music and environmental studies.  
The school is also one of a number in  
the Rural Schools Project with shared  
facilities like a minibus.             </content>
