		<title>03Farming, Bleakholt Sanctuary</title>
		<content> Some of the farms are no longer used  
 for traditional farming but have      
 developed more specialised functions. 
{Bleakholt Farm}is now an animal       
 sanctuary and{  Fecit Farm}is now     
 concerned with the breeding of        
 pedigree dogs, namely Great Danes.    
 Bleakholt covers about 34 acres and   
 has been in operation for 18 years,   
 whilst Fecit Farm is small by         
 comparision occuping 5 _ 6 acres.     
    Bleakholt Animal Sanctuary,        
 situated just outside Turn Village,   
 does not provide boarding kennel      
 facilities for the many dogs, nor is  
 it a resting place for any of the     
 animals whose owners may go on        
 holiday. It is only a sanctuary for   
 animals which have been abandoned,    
 mistreated or lost. The Sanctuary will
 acccept any animal as long as it can  
 be adequately cared for.              </content>
