		<content>   The Great Wood and Dodds Grove are  
 managed by Southend-on-Sea Borough    
 Concil as a{Nature Reserve}.Sixteen   
 hectares was purchased in 1937 and a  
 further 21 ha. in 1946, mainly as a   
 result of pressure from the South-East
 Essex Natural History Society.        
   Coppicing of the Great Wood was     
 resumed 15 years ago as a means of    
 improving habitats for wild-life.     
 About 2 ha. is coppiced annually under
 a 20 year cycle. Some coppiced poles  
 are used by the Parks Dept. but most  
 are sold under contract to timber     
 firms. The warden also undertakes path
 improvement, nesting site provision   
 and educational work with the help of 
 council workers, government work      
 schemes and volunteers.
