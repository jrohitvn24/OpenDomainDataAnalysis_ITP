		<content>   The architecture in{Cookham}is very 
 varied.  The houses around the{Rise}  
 are predominently small family homes, 
 either detached or semi-detached      
 although a few terraced               
 properties,circa 1900,may be seen.    
 The narrow{Pound}road has small       
 terraced houses and public houses on  
 one side with large detached, mainly  
 white faced houses on the other.      
 The mixture of building styles in {   
{Cookham Village}makes it picturesque  
 and unique, and is a tourist          
 attraction for both road and river    
 users.  The village is often used as a
 setting for television drama and      
 advertisements. Half-timbered houses,a
 thatched cottage,terraced houses and  
 stone buildings can be seen. The{     
{School Lane}buildings still retain    
 remnants of their brewing connections.
