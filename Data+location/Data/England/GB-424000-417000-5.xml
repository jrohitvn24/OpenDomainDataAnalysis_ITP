		<content>      The{houses}in our square are     
 mostly{council}and{privately owned.}  
 Some of them are{big}and some are     
{small.} The council houses are        
{semi-detached.}They all look the same,
 and they are on a steady slope.  The  
 privately owned houses are much bigger
 and fancier.  They are mainly         
 semi-detached.  Some of the houses    
 have a{garage,}for a car or a bike,   
 built into the house with quite a long
{drive}going up to the garage. The     
 drives are very well made.            
      The houses are made out of{brick,
{stone and cement. }There are a few    
{detached}houses in our area. Most of  
 the houses have a{garden,}some big,   
 some small. The street{lamps}are quite
 new,{clean}and with their covers still
 on.  Most of the paving stones in the 
 street are in place, and they aren't  
{littered}with{paper and leaves.}      </content>
