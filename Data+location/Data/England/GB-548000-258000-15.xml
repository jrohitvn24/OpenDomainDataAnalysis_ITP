		<title>15Champion roller skater</title>
		<content> In 1962 Mr. and Mrs. Colclough won the
 World Pairs Roller Skating            
 Championship.Their son and daughter   
 are both accomplished skaters.        
 Mr. Colclough worked for the Phillips 
 group of companies as an              
 industrial designer and when he was   
 promoted the family moved from Great  
 Yarmouth to Fen Ditton. Soon          
 afterwards Phillips moved their design
 operations to Europe and at that      
 time, for family reasons, it was not  
 possible for Mr. Colclough to move, so
 at the age of 50 he became redundant. 
 After much thought Mr. Colclough      
 decided to become a freelance designer
 and unexpectedly began to receive     
 commissions from his former employers.
 He worked 12 hours a day, seven days a
 week, and at first could not even find
 time for a holiday.Now he has holidays
 but still works a 12 hour day.        </content>
