   A lot of the houses in Charing have 
wells in their gardens. As bits have   
been added on to the houses some people
have even found wells in their front   
rooms, such as in the restaurant in the
High Street. We have not been able to  
make an accurate count of the number of
wells in this grid square, but nine are
marked on our map and children at this 
school have told us about wells that   
are not marked.
