		<title>14FULFORTH FARM P5</title>
		<content>   The brucelosis and T.T testing is   
 done by the vets.The calves are reared
 and mainly sold as stores.            
   Three markets in the area are used, 
 Hexham (probably most frequently ) but
 also Tyneside (for fat stock) and Tow 
 Law (for stores).                     
   It was difficult to get any idea of 
 a typical day's work as this clearly  
 depends very much upon weather and    
 season.The farmer usually  spends the 
 first part of the morning(7.30am -    
 10.00am) going around and inspecting  
 the stock. Lunch break is from 12.00  
 to 1.00pm. Again the length of the    
 working day varies depending upon     
 season, weather etc.                  
   The most spectacular change in the  
 last 10 years has been the increasing 
 use of sprays ( for everything !!)    
  The son is responsible for this using
 a big 40 foot boom on the tractor.    </content>
