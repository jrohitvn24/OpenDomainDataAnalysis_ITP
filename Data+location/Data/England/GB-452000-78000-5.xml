		<content>  Mr.W. left his home at 8.a.m and     
 walked 2 and a half miles to school.  
 If he heard the train go by he had    
 time to run down the hill and line    
 up.They showed their hands and shoes  
 to the headmaster,then went into class
 to register. They did arithmetic until
 playtime. Mrs.W. played hopscotch and 
 Mr.W. played whip and top. Then they  
 did maths.They had their lunch in the 
 Board room then went for a walk up to 
 the obelisk.                          
  In the afternoon the boys did        
 gardening and the girls needlework.   
  Mrs.W. was once asked to wind        
 a ball of wool.When she took it up the
 teacher said "What do you call        
 this,it's like a cricket ball", threw 
 the wool at her and said "Now do it   
 properly".At 4 o' clock it was time to
 go home,they got their coats and bags 
 and walked home.                      </content>
