   Although Sutton St James is a small 
 village, there are quite a lot of     
 things going on, especially during the
 winter.On Thursdays the Brownies meet 
 in the Scout Hut to play games, make  
 things, and to attempt different      
 skills to earn badges. In the summer  
 they go on pack holiday. Last year    
 they went to Great Yarmouth.          
 On Wednesdays there is ballroom       
 dancing, where you learn dances like  
 the Boston Two-step, Lilac Waltz, and 
 others. A lot of our girls have won   
 the gold and silver medals.           
  The Cubs also meet in the Scout Hut, 
 but they use the school field for     
 football.The Cubs go on camping       
 weekends. There are also Guides for   
 girls of ten to sixteen,but we have no
 Scouts as there is no-one to take     
 them.                                 </content>
