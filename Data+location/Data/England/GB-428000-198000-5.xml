		<content>                                       
 The A4095 and the River Thames are    
the  two main routes of transport for  
the area. There is also a minor        
interchange to the B4495.Heavy lorries 
and coaches are unable to negotiate the
bridges at Radcot. Vehicles with an    
axle weight exceeding 6 tons are       
prohibited.                            
 The A4095 connects Carterton and      
Faringdon ,the two largest towns on    
the outskirts of this area.            
 Narrowboats and motor cruisers ply    
this stretch of the Thames in the      
holiday season.                        
 There is access down to the river off 
the road that goes to Littleworth.     
 Oxfordshire County Council is         
responsible for the roads, whilst the  
Thames Water Authority is responsible  
for the lock not far from Radcot       
Bridge.                                </content>
