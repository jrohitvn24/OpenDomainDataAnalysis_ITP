		<title>11Residential Centre, Grafham.</title>
		<content>   The Centre was purpose-built in     
 1969 with residential accommodation   
 for 54 students in single, double     
 bunked or eight bedded rooms.         
   Changing values , attitudes and     
 advances in technology have all       
 influenced the development of the     
 programme offered by the centre.      
 Equally the economic climate          
 necessitated an increase in revenue.  
 This would have been best met by the  
 expansion of the adult education and  
 training courses. However, the nature 
 of the accommodation, dormitory       
 sleeping and the lack of classroom and
 seminar working space has not seen the
 necessary increase in bookings and    
 therefore it is felt that to meet the 
 requirements of the 80's there must be
 further development of the centre.
