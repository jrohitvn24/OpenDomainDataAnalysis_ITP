		<title>02ECONOMICS IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content>  We have branches of the National     
 Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds Banks
 and many building societies have      
 offices.In recent years building      
 societies have taken business from    
 banks.Midhurst is a wealthy town so   
 the number of bank and building       
 society accounts is above the national
 average and still rising.More children
 have accounts.High property prices    
 prevent first-time buyers from getting
 mortgages.Private borrowers get loans 
 to make household purchases and       
 businesses borrow to even out cash    
 flows.Credit cards have affected      
 building societies by making easy     
 loans available.Rather than give out  
 cash wage packets,more employers are  
 paying straight into accounts or      
 giving cheques as this reduces        
 security problems.The number of       
 investors is rising steadily.         </content>
