		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF:_</title>
		<content> Rachel's grandparents run a 150 acre  
 dairy farm with 90 cows at Ainley     
 Place.Her grandmother reflects that   
 being a farmer's wife is a 24 hour job
 as a wife,mother,secretary,dairymaid, 
 hostess and above all,a good cook!    
  'My day begins around 7.15am unless  
 customers ring earlier to cancel milk.
 I make breakfast for my husband and   
 myself;my sons and the farm workers   
 have it between 8.30 and 10.30.Numbers
 vary from 4-12.After breakfast I begin
 the housework and prepare the mid-day 
 meal.I often go along to the dairy and
 help with the bottling around 11am.   
 Dinner is from 12.30-2.00pm and is    
 usually a substantial meal.           
 In the afternoon I bake,wash,clean and
 iron.I may help with the cows.Tea is a
 quieter meal.Later,I check accounts,  
 answer mail and sort out wages,tax,vat
 etc.Bed-time is often mid-night.'     </content>
