		<content> We asked 50 people what improvements  
 could be made to the shopping centre  
 and these are the main replies we     
 received: it could be cleaner, seating
 could be installed and one man even   
 suggested having a large roof put over
 it.                                   
 More than half of the people we       
 interviewed attended functions at the 
 Civic Centre which is used as a       
 theatre, exhibition hall and, on      
 occassions, a disco.                  
 The shops in the Precinct are used as 
 much as,if not more than,the shops in 
 Grimsby.The average number of visits  
 to the Precinct is  4 times per person
 in a week.
