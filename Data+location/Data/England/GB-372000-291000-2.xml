     The land to the south of St.Mary's
 school is mainly farm land consisting 
 of arable,pasture and woodland, much  
 of which is the remains of the old    
 forest of Morfe. In section           
 91/72,73,74,75 we found a total of 45 
 arable and 43 pasture fields. The     
 whole area lies on a mass of sandstone
 laid long ago by some ancient sea. The
 trees are mainly coniferous because of
 the shallow soil,few deciduous trees  
 grow here. The land is dry,well       
 drained by the sandstone beneath,so   
 pasture and crops often turn yellow in
 the long hot summers. Quatford Wood is
 an example of an ancient forest, two  
 thirds coniferous,one third deciduous.
 Some of the children walked this area:
 Quatford has many old houses,they and 
 their setting have changed little     
 since they were built by the old road.</content>
