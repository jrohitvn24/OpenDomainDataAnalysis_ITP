		<title>15Kirkby Outdoor Market</title>
		<content> On 3rd May a group of children from   
 Kingsway School went down Lowmoor Road
 to the open air market.On the market  
 were about 50 stalls.Lots of the      
 stalls sold clothes.Others sold       
 underwear,sportswear,vegetables and   
 meat.We interviewed eight stallholders
 and four said theirs was a family     
 business.One of the questions asked   
 was,"Roughly how much do you take?"and
 some of the answers were:"Personal",  
 "Not enough","Noy saying",and"Â£200".  
   The market has operated for about   
 nine years.The rent for one stall is  
 Â£7 per day.                           
  Another question was,"Do you sell    
 here each day of opening?"Seven people
 said "Yes".                           
  The market operates from about 8.00  
 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. on Fridays and      
 Saturdays.                            
                                       </content>
