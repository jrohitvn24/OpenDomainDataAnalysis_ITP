		<content>  The{first train}ran on this line in  
{1874.}People could travel in comfort  
 from the{suburbs to their work in     
{B'ham.}The line closed in{1963}because
 it was not profitable.                
  It became{overgrown}and used as a    
{rubbish dump.}Fortunately a group of  
{volunteers}were able to transform the 
 line between{1975-81 into the Harborne
{Walkway.                              
  The old route is now used for{walking
{dogs, cycling and jogging. It}is an   
 attractive and picturesque area with  
 many{trees and wild flowers}growing   
 there.                                
  The railway bridges are still        
 standing. There are some old sleepers 
 and an old L.M.S. sign by Park Hill   
 bridge.{Unfortunately}there have been 
 news stories of{mugging and glue      
{sniffing}along the pathway which spoil
 the amenity to some extent.           </content>
