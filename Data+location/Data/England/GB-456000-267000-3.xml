		<content>  The village pub is called the Old    
Coach House.It used to be an old       
farmhouse,with about 100 acres of      
land.In 1947 it became a pub and a     
farm, but now most of the land has been
sold.The lounge is now where a pig sty 
used to be, and the old cow-shed has   
been converted to stables for horses.  
  The pub has a pool table,skittles,   
and a dart-board.It is very popular    
with people from nearby villages and   
from Daventry.There is a large         
car-park and a beer-garden.            
  There is no village institute, but   
there is a village hall where          
concerts,displays, and meetings are    
held.There is no youth club either, but
the children occasionlly have discos in
the village hall, or go to youth clubs 
in the larger villages nearby.
