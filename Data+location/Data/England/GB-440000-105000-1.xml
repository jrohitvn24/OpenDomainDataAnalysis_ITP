		<content> HYTHE - The prominent feature of Hythe
 is the pier.It was built approximately
 100 years ago by some landowners. It  
 enables ferries to cross over to      
 Southampton. Originally only walk     
 could use it. In 1922 an electrified  
 railway was added. There's also a     
 typical High Street. St John's Church 
 is also there, built in the 1840's. A 
 Marina Village is now being built, due
 to finish in 1990. DIBDEN - At Dibden 
 there's a scattered parish fronting   
 onto Southampton Water whose main     
 interest to the visitor is the Parish 
 Church of All Saints which dates back 
 to the 12th century. It was damaged by
 an airraid during the war, but has now
 been beautifully restored and still   
 fulfils its functions to the locality.
 DIBDEN PURLIEU is a modern residential
 area with admirable shopping          
 facilities close to the forest.       </content>
