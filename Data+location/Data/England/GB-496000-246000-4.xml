		<content> The area is covered by a drift deposit
 of Boulder clay, has clay-loam soils  
 and is Grade 2 Agricultural land.     
 There were more mixed farms in this   
 area. Farming policies have           
 transformed the area, several farms   
 have changed completely and arable    
 crops now predominate. Only scattered 
 pasture areas remain such as the Firs,
 brewery owned land adjacent to the 3  
 Horseshoes public house and at West   
 End Farm, Kempston. A rotation of     
 barley, rape and 3 wheats are grown in
 a 5 year cycle. Minimal cultivation   
 methods are used and surplus straw and
 stubble are burnt after harvesting.
