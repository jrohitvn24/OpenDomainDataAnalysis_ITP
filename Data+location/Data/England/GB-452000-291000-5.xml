		<title>05OLD BROUGHTON MILL</title>
		<content> Broughton Astley Mill is the only mill
 in Leicestershire still operating on  
 its original site. It was, at first, a
 windmill that was destroyed by fire   
 which lead to its conversion to a     
 water mill in  1803. Then in 1945 it  
 was converted to electricity by the   
 late L.G.W  Pickering. Despite        
 development and modernisation the mill
 still retains the character of years  
 past. Broughton mill is 150 yards from
 the stream. Water from the stream fed 
 a canal leading to the mill behind a  
 6_7 foot dam wall.The stream once     
 powered three other mills before      
 reaching Broughton Mill.              
   Today the mill compounds all types  
 of rations for different animals and  
 also produces a special complete dry  
 dog food,known as Astley Dog.
