		<content>{The Blacksmith's Arms}is so named     
 because the{Blacksmith}had his shop   
 behind the {public house.}Nearly every
 cottage had its own cow but fresh milk
 could be bought from the{farms. }Now  
 there are no cows in the village and  
 milk is delivered from {Goole.}People 
 could travel from the village into    
{Goole}by horse drawn bus twice a week 
 on Wednesdays and Saturdays.Every     
 Sunday the {Mail Coach }thundered     
 through the village and all the young 
 children ran into their houses because
 they were frightened.In{1919}a        
{Memorial Hall}was built as a{Memorial}
 to the people who died in the{First   
{World War.}Lord Montague donated the  
 land and the money for the building   
 was raised by the{villagers.}When{Mrs.
{Belton}attended the{village}school she
 had to curtsey to the{Headmaster}every
 morning.{Mr.Belton}had to bow to him. </content>
