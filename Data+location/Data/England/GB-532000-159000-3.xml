		<title>03Types of housing in Kenley</title>
		<content>   The housing in Kenley is varied.In  
 Hermitage Rd.the houses are big and   
 have got quite alot of land.Some of   
 them are like cottages which are      
 pretty.They are all detached.Along    
 Valley Rd.most of the houses are semi 
 detached.Although the odd one or two  
 are detached.Also there are a few     
 bungalows along there.Godstone Rd. has
 quite a few rows of terraced          
 houses.These are where the working    
 people live.There are three blocks of 
 flats along Valley Rd.These flats are 
 mostly for people who have just got   
 married and haven't got much money.   
    The{Godstone Rd.}is the main road  
 through our area.I live at 247        
 Godstone Rd. I like living at my house
 because it is always noisy and I am   
 used to the noise. I do not like my   
 house because it is too small,and it  
 has only got a small garden.          </content>
