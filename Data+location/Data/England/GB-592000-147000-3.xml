  We have been collecting information  
about the age of buildings in Charing  
and what they are used for.            
  We have found out that the biggest   
proportion of the buildings are used   
for housing and are in the range of    
ten to fifty years old.                
 The shops in Charing High Street are  
generally over a hundred years old. We 
only found three disused buildings and 
they were all over a hundred years     
old. Although the buildings are        
disused now, we expect them to be in   
use soon as they are for sale.         
 Despite council house development in  
the last 50 years the overall          
impression of Charing is that of a     
largely unspoilt Kentish village.
