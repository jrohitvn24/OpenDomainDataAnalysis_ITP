		<content>      Over the weekend beginning 17th  
 May 1985 a survey was undertaken of   
 local residents' views on the need for
 a community centre. Of the 416 people 
 interviewed;                          
   326 were in favour,                 
   53 were against,                    
   37 didn't comment.                  
 Main reasons for being in favour were;
   Sporting activities and functions157
   Organisations to hold meetings   101
   Bingo                             53
   Children's evening entertainment  28
   Youth club                        20
   Play school                       15
   Important for devt. of village    12
 Main reasons for negative responses   
 were high cost and lack of demand.    
 Most people thought it should be built
 on the recreation ground or at least  
 somewhere central.  There are now     
 plans for Parish Rooms to be converted</content>
