		<title>15BEACH POLLUTION/SEA DEFENCES</title>
		<content> The sandy beach is sometimes spoilt by
 litter left by tourists. I've found   
 cans, bottles and leftover food which 
 the seagulls scavange. Washed up on   
 the beach are oil cans,rags,detergent 
 bottles .Tiny oil or tar stains are   
 sometimes found.A dead sheep was once 
 washed up.                            
 In the summer the beach near the sea  
 defences gets full of litter but in   
 winter the beaches are clean.         
 The sea defences are built out of     
 reinforced concrete and are about 6   
 metres high at Chapel Point.They are  
 built in steps and curve at the top   
 at headland areas.The groynes are made
 of wood and the sections are bolted   
 together.The groynes are eroding.     
 Overall,our beach is fairly free from 
 pollution.
