		<title>15Changes in farming &amp; fishing</title>
		<content> There have been many changes in       
 various aspects of life in Clovelly   
 within the span of a lifetime notably 
 in{agriculture.} A change from :-     
 handmilking to machine milking; churns
 to bulk tanker collection; hedge      
 trimming with hook to machine; horse  
 to tractor; haymaking by hand to      
 baling by machine; hand shearing of   
 sheep to electrical clippers and from 
 hand reaping to combine harvesting.   
 Today agriculture is an industry with 
 more mechanisation and fewer          
 employees.  There are also fewer      
 hedges.                               
 In{fishing}there has also been change.
 There is not so much fishing done now 
 with a special decline in herring     
 fishing after the E.E.C. ban.
