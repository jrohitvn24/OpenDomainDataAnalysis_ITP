		<title>10Methodist Chapel in Cumbria</title>
		<content> The 78 year old Methodist Chapel at   
 Castle Sowerby is built of corrugated 
 iron (photograph included).   It      
 consists of a main room panelled in   
 wood with an alter and wooden pews,   
 and an ante-room used for Sunday      
 School.                               
 About 20 people attend the weekly     
 Service, which is conducted by one of 
 the 18 preachers on the Wigton        
 Methodist Circuit.   There is also a  
 midweek Bible Class.   About 16       
 children aged 3 - 13 attend the Sunday
 School regularly, mostly from non-    
 Methodist families.    They have Bible
 stories, singing and quizes.   There  
 are annual parties and outings.       
 The Chapel is administered by a couple
 who combine the duties of Chairman,   
 Secretary, Treasurer, Caretaker and   
 Cleaner.                              
                                       </content>
