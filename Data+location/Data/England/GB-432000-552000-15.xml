		<title>15Our Churches</title>
		<content>   There is a great choice of churches 
 in our area. As well as the Anglican, 
 Roman Chatholic and Methodist churches
 there is also the Salvation Army and  
 the Spritualist Church.               
   The oldest church is Penshaw All    
 Saint's, built in 1746 as a Chapel of 
 Ease and becoming a parish church in  
 1838. The church has five stained     
 glass windows, one is a{memorial}to   
 the local men who died in World War I 
 and II.Inside the church can be found 
 a stone from the{Great Pyramids in    
{Egypt.}The bell is rung each morning  
 except for Friday.                    
   St Aidan's church can be found in   
 Herrington. The church was built in   
 1886 but is in a very poor state of   
 repair.The vicar the Reverend Varley  
 said that the church is to be knocked 
 down in 1986 and  it is going to be   
{rebuilt}the same year.                </content>
