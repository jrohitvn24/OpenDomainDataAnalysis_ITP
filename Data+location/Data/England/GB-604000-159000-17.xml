 Methodist Primary.It is a small red   
 brick building erected in 1905.There  
 were originally 4 classrooms around   
 the main hall.The age range was from 5
 to 14.                                
  It has since been altered and        
 extended to include 2 purpose built   
 infant classrooms,kitchen and library 
 area.There are also on site 2 hutted  
 junior classroooms,1 mobile for music 
 and T.V.,plus outdoor toilet block and
 air-raid shelter now used as a store. 
 At present there are 147 children     
 whose ages are 5 to 11.               
  We have many activities such as work,
 sports,fetes and fun.Work consists of

 P.E..At playtimes we play football,   
 netball,climb on the apparatus and    
 make up our own games.(Ref.p.11 &amp; 12).
