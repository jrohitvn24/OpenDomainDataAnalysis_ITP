		<title>16SCHOOLS IN HUMBERSTON</title>
		<content> There are both Primary and Secondary  
 Schools  in the village. There is a   
 Church of England Primary School,a    
 County Infants School,a County Junior 
 School and an 11 to 16 Comprehensive  
 School. All the schools have suffered 
 from the falling birth rate of the    
 past ten years. The falling rolls have
 brought problems to the schools.      
 Surplus staff have been compulsorily  
 or voluntarily redeployed to other    
 schools, leaving smaller numbers of   
 teachers responsible for the wide     
 modern curriculum. Local support for  
 the schools is strong. As rolls fall, 
 the future of the schools is          
 uncertain. Within the next five years 
 some schools within Humberside        
 Education Authority face closure.     
 Action groups formed by parents and   
 governors are fighting to retain      
 Humberston's facilities.              </content>
