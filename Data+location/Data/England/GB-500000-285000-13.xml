		<title>13BARNWELL PARK - FISHING</title>
		<content>    At Barnwell Park there are lots of 
 fish you can catch e.g. tench, perch, 
 roach, bream, dace, chub and          
 pike.Some lakes are different because 
 some are wildlife lakes and you can   
 not fish there. Fishing is not        
 encouraged on the wildlife lakes that 
 is because the lead might kill the    
 birds.Other rules in the park is that 
 you must have a permit to fish there  
 and you must have a rod licence and   
 you must not drop litter.The disabled 
 can fish there because there are      
 special places to fish in.The best    
 place to fish is where there are no   
 weeds and lots of trees and bushes.The
 fishing points could be improved by   
 covering over the mud with shingle or 
 even concrete slabs, as has been done 
 in the area specially prepared for    
 disabled fishermen and fisherwomen.
