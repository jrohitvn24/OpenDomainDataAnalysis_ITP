		<title>10TALBOT COMPUTER OFFICES</title>
		<content> Peugeot-Talbot Car Company have a     
 purpose-designed computer building,   
 opened in 1984. About 110 people work 
 in this two storey building where the 
 big Amdahl V7 computer operates 24    
 hours a day, carrying out four very   
 important functions. These are working
 out salaries, collecting information  
 from dealers and sales, ordering      
 materials and checking stock. In the  
 computer room a false floor hides     
 miles of cables which control the     
 temperature as this is vitally        
 important to the efficient running of 
 the computers. The centre even has its
 own electrical sub-station. A tape    
 library houses about 8,500 tapes.     
 Upstairs are the areas for            
 programming, systems design and other 
 support needed in linking up Tile Hill
 with various parts of the United      
 Kingdom and other parts of Europe.    </content>
