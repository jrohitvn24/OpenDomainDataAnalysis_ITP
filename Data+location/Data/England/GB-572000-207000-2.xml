		<content> A favourite{playground game}is called 
{Queenball.}There are four players and 
 plenty of reserves.There is a Queen   
 and he or she has to hit the ball to  
 one of the other three players who    
 must hit it to another player.The     
 object of the game is to get the Queen
 out so a new Queen can go in.One of   
 the rules is that if the ball bounces 
 twice in your square, then you are    
 out.You may hit the ball with any part
 of your body.Queenball is played on a 
 court marked out with four small      
 squares and two large rectangles for  
 the reserves to stand in.When the     
 Queen is out, then the King moves to  
 the Queen's square, the Jack moves to 
 the vacant King's square, the Ace     
 moves to the Jack's position and a new
 player from the reserves moves onto   
 the empty square.
