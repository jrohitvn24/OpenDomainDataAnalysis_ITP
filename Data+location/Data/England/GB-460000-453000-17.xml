		<content>{Looking around the factory there were 
{very few coloured people present.Is   
{this because they do not live around  
{here or do they just not like the     
{work?                                 
 We do not have many immigrant         
 employees,but this is just a          
 reflection on the population of York. 
 It is Company policy to have no       
 discrimination on the basis of Race,  
 Religion or Sex.Ethnic background of  
 employees is not recorded.This is seen
 as a form of discrimination in itself.
{Men seem to be working in shifts and  
{women do not. Is this deliberate      
{policy?                               
 It dates back to Factory Act          
 legislation. We would have to get     
 exemption to work women on shifts. The
 demandfor women to work on shifts is  
 not very great,but we have applied for
 exemption in some areas. (cont p 18)  </content>
