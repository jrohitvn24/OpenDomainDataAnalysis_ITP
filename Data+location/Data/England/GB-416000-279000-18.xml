		<content>   The road system of the area has     
 changed very little over the years.The
 basic framework was set down many     
 hundreds of years ago. Predominantly  
 rural in aspect, the road system      
 developed, linking the small villages 
 of Catherine-de-Barnes, Hampton in    
 Arden, Eastcote and the scattered     
 farms with Solihull.                  
  As Solihull grew, the residential    
 area to the west developed it's road  
 system, while others changed little.  
 Lugtrout Lane, Henwood Lane , Friday  
 Lane have remained tree and hedge     
 lined with grass and ditch verges.    
  The M42 which cuts the area north to 
 south, the A41 dual carriageway and   
 the Damson Parkway have made the most 
 impact in recent years. They have     
 linked the area to the International  
 Airport and the National Exhibition   
 Centre.                               </content>
