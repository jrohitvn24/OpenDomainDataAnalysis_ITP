		<title>05HOUSING IN THRESHFIELD</title>
		<content> The housing in{Threshfield}falls into 
 three broad categories.In the 1st     
 category are the houses which have    
 been built before the{2Oth Century}and
 are of Historical interest.{Ling House
 on the Skipton side of the{road bridge
 was formerly the home of the{local    
{Besom Industry.The Old Hall Inn       
 replaced{Threshfield Hall}but there   
 are features of this remaining.The    
{Manor House}dates back to the 168O's. 
 Most of these old buildings are       
 centred around the{Village Green}and  
 are built from{Limestone.             
{The Quarry Houses}form the second     
 category and were built to house      
 quarry workers in{Skyrethorns Lane.   
 Finally the most recent developments  
 are the{housing estates}at{Badger Gate
 and{Piecefields.}These have developed 
 because most people have cars and are 
 now able to travel to their work.     </content>
