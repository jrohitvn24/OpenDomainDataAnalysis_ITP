		<title>09LOCAL NEWSPAPERS IN FLITWICK</title>
		<content> There are seven local newspapers. Four
 are 'free sheets' delivered to every  
 house each week advertising events    
 and services as well as goods for     
 sale. These  are as much a guide to   
 future events as a record of last     
 week's news. The longer established   
 newspapers have a greater news content
 and are often looked to for pictures  
 and stories of friends or             
 acquaintances. Many people will know  
 someone in at least one of the papers 
 each week and most people will have   
 appeared in a photograph or news item 
 at some time.                         
 The only daily newspaper is published 
 from Luton some ten miles south of    
 Flitwick. It is read by some because  
 it gives news of the area in which    
 they work and by others because they  
 can remain in touch with the area they
 lived in before moving to Flitwick.   </content>
