 In Finchingfield we have a lot        
 of tourists. The first thing you see  
 when you get to the main part 0f the  
 village is a duck pond with the church
 on the hill behind. Well we call it a 
 duck pond but really it is a widened  
 stream.                               
  We have a lot of tourists come       
 every day ,even when it is raining.   
 When it is hot there are lots and lots
 of people and you can't move.A lot of 
 the people that come are old people   
 who come with a group on a bus and    
 others just come to enjoy the view.   
    People come from all over England  
 and even from abroad . As there are so
 many tourists there are extra pubs,a  
 restaurant and more shops than you    
 would normaly find in a village of    
 this size.
