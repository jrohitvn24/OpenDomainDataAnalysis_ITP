		<title>14Fawley Power Station</title>
		<content>    In 1961 consent was sought for the 
 building of a power station on the    
 west bank of Southampton water.This   
 was because of the growing demand for 
 electricity in the south.             
    Fawley Power Station is situated on
 the edge of Southampton water.The     
 station has four 500 megawatt turbines
 which give an electrical output of    
 half a million kw. each and produce a 
 voltage of 22,000 volts.The station   
 also has four gas turbines which have 
 an electrical output of 17,500 kw. and
 a voltage of 11,000 volts.            
    Fawley Power Station is fueled by  
 oil which comes from the nearby Esso  
 Refinery.                             
    The power station employs 486 men  
 and woman.The main chimney at Fawley  
 is 650ft tall.Before the power station
 was built the state of the site       
 consisted of saltings,marsh and sea.  </content>
