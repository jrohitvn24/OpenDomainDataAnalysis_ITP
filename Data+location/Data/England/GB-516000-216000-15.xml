 THE MANOR HOUSE was built in Tudor    
 times. In the reign of Henry the 8th  
 it was owned by Sir Richard Parr,     
 whose daughter, Catherine, was Henry's
 6th wife. Henry is supposed to have   
 courted Catherine, after locking his  
 then wife, Anne Boleyn, up in a dark  
 room in the roof! Anne Boleyn's ghost 
 is supposed to haunt the Manor, but   
 the present occupants have not seen   
 it. A hat of Henry's and a pair of    
 shoes belonging to Anne were left in  
 the house.The house now has a 17th C. 
 facade. At one time it was turned into
 two cottages where the estate's butler
 and gamekeeper lived, called Stag and 
 Hind!
