		<content> The school was built in 1911. There   
 are 8 classrooms a library, staffroom,
 cloakrooms, and stockrooms. We have a 
 playing field and a playground with   
 logs, tunnels and a sandpit. There are
 196 children in our school aged 4 to  
 11 years. There are four computers,   
 tape recorders and a video camera. We 
 do Maths, English, Art, Topic, Games, 
 Handwriting and Group Work. In the    
 classrooms the desks are arranged in  
 groups so that 4 or 6 children sit    
 together. Classes visit museums,      
 farms, environmental centres and other
 places connected with the work they   
 are doing. A group of children are    
 learning to play string instruments   
 and many of the children play         
 recorders. There are clubs for,       
 cooking, sewing, science, gardening,  
 art and Scripture Union.
