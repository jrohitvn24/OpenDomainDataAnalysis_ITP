		<title>11MOVERONS FARM</title>
		<content> Moverons Farm,lying entirely east of  
 the River Colne,consists of 400 acres 
 of land,part marshy,part glacial      
 gravel,and most of it under cereal    
 crops.Wheat and barley take up 150    
 acres each,the rest of the farm being 
 under 46 acres of peas,10 acres of    
 potatoes,an experimental 2 acre crop  
 of lupins,grown for their oil,and 42  
 acres of grass grown for hay.         
 The farm is on an exposed             
 site,affected by strong winds,although
 the air is less moist than adjacent   
 to the sea at Brightlingsea Point.    
 It is interesting that Dutch Elm      
 disease has destroyed the farm's      
 windshield of elms and that the       
 farmhouse front door has been moved   
 from the north side of the house      
 since the north wind in winter negated
 the effects of the central heating.
