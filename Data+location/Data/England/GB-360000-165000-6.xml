		<title>06St. Augustine's Church</title>
		<content> Built for the growing population of   
 Whitchurch,this ecumenical centre was 
 dedicated by the Bishop of Bristol in 
 1972. Its flexible design caters for  
 the many groups that meet there,such  
 as Playgroups,Brownies,Guides,the     
 Elderly,Drama and Dance.Part of the   
 wall between the Church and hall can  
 be removed enlarging the Church for   
 special occasions. The modern         
 beechwood furniture is movable too.The
 font is Norman,the bell 18th          
 century.The modern windows by Michael 
 Hutchins are the colours of the       
 spectrum.The Pascoe sculpture of      
 Christ on a cross is most striking.   
 After 13 years of frequent safety     
 checks the bell tower had to be       
 demolished &amp; design &amp; building faults 
 necessitated the strengthening of     
 foundations &amp; walls.
