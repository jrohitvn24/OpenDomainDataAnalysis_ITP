		<content> Grange Nursery is situated on the old 
 Woodham road. It covers in all an area
 of 24.5 hectares, two hectares of     
 which is under glass, the remainder   
 being put down to grass for hay.      
 The nursery is wholesale only, growing
 bedding plants for the Spring and pot-
 plants mainly for Easter, Mothers Day 
 and Christmas.  The nursery employs   
 30 full-time people and about 35 part 
 time on a seasonal basis. Of the area 
 under glass, the largest house has an 
 area of over 180 square metres.       
 The houses are heated by hot water,   
 generated by large oil burning        
 furnaces.  The top-soil being used at 
 present is from the building of the   
 new Woodham road, during the          
 construction of which, the nursery    
 lost 2 hectares of land.  The nursery 
 has been on the site since 1938, when 
 it was started by the owner's father. </content>
