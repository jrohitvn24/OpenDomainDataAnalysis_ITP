		<title>05FARMING IN GENERAL</title>
		<content>   Farming in this area is mainly      
 restricted to cattle and sheep.The    
 sheep are all kept on the high ground 
 such as the nearby mountains,but the  
 cattle are lower in the valleys and   
 feed on the lush grass. to feed these 
 animals in winter a lot of silage is  
 made,hay although once popular is now 
 rarely made.                          
   Very little ploughing is done       
 although a bit of ground is ploughed  
 on the very flat grounds where oil    
 seed rape is grown,besides oil seed   
 rape hardly any alternative crops are 
 grown,a little woodand surrounds the  
 area but this is not significant.The  
 farmers are reasonably up to date with
 machinery although big machines are   
 rarely used,mainly a tractor is used  
 to feed the sheep or load the silage  
 etc.
