		<content> In the Burgess Rolls there are details
 of people, their occupations, when    
 they were born , and when they died . 
 You can also look at microfilms of    
 old newspapers.                       
                                       
    When you have found the information
 you need, you then see where it fits. 
 If you come across a name but there   
 are no details, and all you know is   
 the parish in which the person lived, 
 you may visit the church in the       
 parish. After you have looked inside ,
 you go and look around the graveyard. 
 (This needs patience because with     
 seeing so many graves you think that  
 you are going to be here for the rest 
 of your life.)                        
                                       
     Some people now make a business   
 out of searching for other people's   
 ancestors.                            </content>
