		<title>07THE M20 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>     Work has begun this spring on the 
 "missing link" of the M20 motorway    
 between Maidstone and Ashford.The     
 route takes the motorway along the    
 southern edge of the D-block in the   
 beautiful open countryside between    
 Hollingbourne and Leeds Castle. The   
 road is much needed to cope with the  
 large volumn of traffic between London
 and the important coastal ports of    
 Folkestone and Dover but its route has
 been much opposed by local residents  
 who fear its effect on the largely    
 unspoilt countryside.                 
     The first signs of the mototway   
 have already appeared in the form of  
 support structures needed for the     
 bridges that will carry the road      
 over the existing A20.
