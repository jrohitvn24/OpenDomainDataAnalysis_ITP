		<content> I like four square.A square divided   
 into 4 is drawn.One child stands in   
 each square.Bounce the ball (and hit  
 it with your hands)to your friends.He 
 can't hit it straight back to you -   
 that is back-pass,and he would be     
 out.The ball cannot bounce on the     
 lines.

 French Skipping is played with a hoop 
 of elastic.Two people stand inside the
 elastic and put it round their        
 ankles.One person jumps inside the    
 elastic,then outside.Then she jumps on
 both pieces.Whilst the person is      
 jumping,the people inside the elastic 
 say a rhyme;"In,Big Ben strikes       
 ten,one,two,three,four,five,six,seven,
 eight,nine,ten,out".
