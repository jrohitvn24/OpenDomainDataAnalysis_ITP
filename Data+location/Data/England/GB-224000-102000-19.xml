		<title>19History in Industries Lost</title>
		<content>  Years ago Bridgerule was a thriving  
 community with several small          
 industries. Life and work was centred 
 around the village with very few      
 people going outside for employment.  
  There were two working quarries from 
 which stone for many local buildings  
 was obtained. There was no running    
 water for many years and up until     
 fairly recently water was fetched from
 an underground pipe which carried     
 water from a spring. There is an old  
 aqueduct in Littlebridge Hill which   
 collapsed several years ago. This     
 carried the Bude canal and there were 
 two wharfs connected with it.         
  Other industries that have been lost 
 include sawmills, a wheelwright,      
 blacksmiths, a boot and shoe maker and
 a butcher's shop. Also there used to  
 be a working watermill which ground   
 all the local grain for flour.        </content>
