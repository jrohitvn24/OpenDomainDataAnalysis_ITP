		<title>02The Hamlet of Hassop.</title>
		<content> A handful of houses, a farm, a pub and
 an unusual church are what now remains
 of the estate of Hassop. The big house
 itself, with its gardens and orangery,
 is now a country hotel.               
 The church, which was built by the    
 Catholic owners of the estate, is an  
 architectural curiosity, being in a   
 heavy Palladian style, of sandstone,  
 with a pillared portico. It now acts  
 as the main Catholic church for the   
 Bakewell District, with many cars     
 coming out each Sunday.               
 The Dower House and farm are next to  
 each other. A very modern barn in     
 which cows are kept throughout the    
 winter is across the road.            
 The hamlet has a public telephone next
 to the pub.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
