		<content> In our kitchen we have a kettle to    
boil water,an electric cooker, with    
four hot plates a grill and an oven, a 
mixer to make puddings and pastries, a 
refridgerator and a freezer to preserve
food.                                  
 In the dining room we have a boiler   
that heats the water for all the       
radiators in the house. These keep us  
warm.                                  
 In our lounge we have a television, a 
video cassette recorder and a stereo   
tape recorder.                         
 In my bedroom I have a calculator     
keyboard on which I play different     
tunes and work out sums.  I also have  
a Pac-man game, where the little bug   
goes round eating red dots.            
 In my parents bedroom there is a      
television, and a radio alarm clock    
to get them up in the morning.
