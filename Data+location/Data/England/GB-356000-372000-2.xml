  Most of the farms in the area are    
 mixed farms.  They keep dairy cattle, 
 beef cattle and sheep.   One          
 farm has 350 breeding sows and piglets
 and a fattening unit, whilst about a  
 mile away there is a chicken farm.    
  Some farms are arable farms with no  
 cattle.  Crops grown include cereal   
 crops for cattle food, grass for      
 grazing, silage and potatoes.         
  A number of farmers specialoze in    
 contract work.  This can be ploughing,
 bailing combining, mowing, silaging,  
 spraying, hedge cutting and potato    
 harvesting.                           
  A few farmers have sold their land,  
 leaving a large house retaining the   
 name farm, but having only a few      
 hectares of rough grazing land for    
 horses and ponies.                    </content>
