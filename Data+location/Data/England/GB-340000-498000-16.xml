		<content> There are three other residential     
 homes for the elderly, all sited in   
 the vicinity of St. Mary's church.    
 Applethwaite Green is run by the South
 Lakeland District Council and provides
 full care facilities, while nearby    
 Birthwaite, also council-run, provides
 warden-assisted sheltered housing  in 
 the form of small, self-contained     
 flats. A new extension has just been  
 opened. Almost next door is one of the
 privately run Abbeyfield homes.       
 Windermere is a popular area to which 
 to retire and the age 'pyramid' of the
 local population shows a definite     
 bulge in the over 55's. The provision 
 of suitable accomodation for the      
 elderly in the area is therefore      
 important, although many will be      
 financially independant.
