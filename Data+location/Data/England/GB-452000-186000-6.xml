		<title>06East Hagbourne- homes survey</title>
		<content>A survey conducted by the 1st yr of St.
Birinus school, Didcot in East         
Hagbourne on a random sample of 48     
properties showed 73% owner occupied,  
10% privately rented and 17% council.  
The conclusions drawn from this survey 
showed that the private sector includes
all the larger detached properties,    
some bungalows and semi-detached. Only 
the newer houses on the eastern side   
have gas heating, the others rely      
mainly on electricity. The distance    
from the shops is reflected in the high
number of homes with freezers (83%) in 
which to store bulk purchases, and     
high car ownership. The older houses   
tend to have the largest gardens (up   
to 1/4 acre) and the most bedrooms,    
with more than one reception room. The 
council properties on the north west   
of the village are 2 bed maisonettes   
and 1 bed terraced bungalows           </content>
