		<content> We have enjoyed our year in 3MA. Mr   
 Anderson is our teacher he is alright 
 we suppose.Some of the work that we do
 is Maths,English.The kind of Maths    
 that we do is called S.M.P.Our class  
 have all had our ups and downs but    
 we've managed to get through it.Our   
 names are Karen Chandler and Kika Holt
 and we are aged 11 our best friend is 
 Emily Hill.Everyone finds it easy to  
 get on with Mr Anderson because he's  
 so understanding.Sometimes he has his 
 moods but apart from that he's a nice 
 teacher.We all like Drama thats the   
 time when we get to know              
 each other.The games that we play are 
 Cat and Mouse, that's what we all     
 enjoy most.The other two third year   
 teachers are Mrs Steel and Mr Roe.All 
 the children in the third year get on 
 with each other.
