This square remains much as it was in 1986 as it part part of the large Crichel Estate owned by the Hon. Mrs. M. Marten.The houses are occupied in a similar fashion. The estate cottages have been modernised in recent years.&lt;br />&lt;br />Sadly, Cdr. G.G. Marten died in 1997 and his wife Hon. M. Marten about two years ago. At this time the whole Crichel Estate of several thousand acres is up for sale and there may be changes in the future.&lt;br />&lt;br />Farming has changed in that pigs have been reared on a large scale in recent years.&lt;br />&lt;br />The facilities eg. shops and doctors remain as before.   &lt;br />Contribution by: Heather Bartlett and Gillian Martin</content>
