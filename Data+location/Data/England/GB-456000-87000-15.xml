		<title>15Crops in the Ashey area</title>
		<content>  The most noticeable crop is the      
{oilseed rape}which covers the fields  
 with bright yellow flowers. It is a   
 forage crop.                          
  We also found considerable areas of  
 grass,mostly pasture but some would   
 become a{hay}crop in early Summer.    
  Some of the fields were sown with    
 cereals.We expect these would be      
{barley,wheat and oats}which would be  
 harvested in the late Summer.         
  Some of the{woodland}also appeared to
 be being cut down and we were told of 
 a new sawmill being started in        
 Rowlands Lane.It is only a clearing at
 the moment.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
