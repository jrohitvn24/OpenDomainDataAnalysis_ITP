		<title>14The Michaelmas Fair, St Ives</title>
		<content> The Michaelmas Fair has been coming to
 St Ives for the last 784 years, the   
 first recorded event being October    
 12th, 1200. The fair has a right to   
 set up in St Ives by charter.         
                                       
 In modern times the site of the fair  
 has led to complaints from shopkeepers
 and townspeople. Many of the sideshows
 and rides have to be sited within a   
 few feet of the windows and doors of  
 shops. In addition, they feel that if 
 a fire were to take place, emergency  
 vehicles would not  be able to get to 
 the fire.                             
                                       
 It remains to be seen if the fair will
 remain where it is or bow to the      
 pressure to move elsewhere.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
