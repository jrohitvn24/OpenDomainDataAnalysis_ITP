		<title>14DERBYSHIRE HILL FARMING 2.</title>
		<content>   On one local Derbyshire farm,       
 several cross-bred cows are kept in   
 the long shippon next to the farmhouse
 during the winter months. They calve  
 in May or June and are then turned out
 with their calves. Heifer calves stay 
 as replacements in the herd; bull     
 calves will be kept until the         
 September sales of their first or     
 second year.                          
   During May and June, the shippons   
 are thoroughly cleaned out and the    
 muck spread and harrowed onto the hay 
 meadows. Routine farm work like       
 thistle cutting, walling and fencing  
 all have to be finished before        
 hay-making in July or August.         
   Straw and corn are bought in for the
 cattle during the winter months.      
   A milking cow is also kept for      
 domestic use.
