 of the trail passes through a garden  
 of rhododendron bushes.  These        
 rhododendrons are a popular part of   
 the gardens as are the splendid rose  
 gardens.   Another major development  
 in the estate is the construction of  
 an amphitheatre in front of the stable
 block.   This amphitheatre is used for
 band concerts, Morris Dancing and     
 plays, the latter have icluded Twelfth

 well attended.  The Grounds of the    
 House are used throughout the year for
 many exhibitions and shows, Ideal     
 Homes Exhibition and Folk Concerts.

 winter the grounds are used for       
 sledging and ice skating.             </content>
