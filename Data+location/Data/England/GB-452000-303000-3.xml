		<title>03THE BRAUNSTONE ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Braunstone Estate consists of a   
 large council estate just of the main 
 A47 road to Hinckley Town.            
 It was built just after the second    
 world war in the early 1950's.The     
 houses are mainly semi-detached       
 with large gardens but without        
 garages.The population is a mixture of
 senior citizens,young families with   
 children and middle aged people whose 
 children have grown up and left home. 
 The houses have just been extensively 
 renovated as they were beginning to   
 become old and in need of repair.     
 The estate has just been divided by a 
 new ring road which is under          
 construction.This has caused some     
 strong feelings on the estate and     
 various petitions have been           
 presented to the council.
