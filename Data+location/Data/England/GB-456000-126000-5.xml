		<content> Freeman's is a big timber merchant and
 builder just behind the school.Before 
 it became a business it was a farm and
 one of the old barns is still         
 standing.The offices are in the old   
 farm cottages.The firm is 110 years   
 old and is the main employer in the   
 area.Mr. Stenning showed us around,he 
 has worked there for forty years.He   
 showed us the wood they import from   
 Russia,Finland and Sweden.Swedish wood
 is marked with a crown and Russian    
 with a star.He said the best wood     
 comes from Russia because it is colder
 there and the wood grows slowly giving
 better quality timber.The Russian wood
 comes from Archangel by boat to       
 Shoreham,then on by lorry.            
 Freemans stock all the different      
 shaped pieces of wood you need to     
 build a house.
