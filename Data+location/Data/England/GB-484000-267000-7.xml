 The church in this old village is     
 dedicated to St.Leonard, the patron   
 saint of prisoners. Most of it was    
 built in 1220 of rubble with a leaded 
 roof. It has a priests door on which  
 can be found three scratch dials.     
 There were two bells at one time, but 
 one has been sold. The other has been 
 removed. It is a Church of England    
 establishment, which will seat a      
 congregation of 140. Services are held
 every fortnight. The vicar is in      
 charge of two churches. The other one 
 being in Mears Ashby.                 
{The CHURCH OF ST.EDMUND CAMPION}is a  
 Roman Catholic Church. It is a modern 
 one and can be found at the junction  
 of Kingsway and Henshaw Road, just off
 the main road to Northampton. On the  
 adjacent site are the Catholic Infant 
 and Junior  schools of Our Lady's.    </content>
