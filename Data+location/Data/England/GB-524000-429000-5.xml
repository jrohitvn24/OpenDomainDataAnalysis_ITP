		<title>05BURTON PIDSEA HOUSES</title>
		<content>      As part of our study of Burton   
 Pidsea we tried to find out how old   
 some of the houses were.              
      Glebelands is a new estate of    
 semi-detached houses which were built 
 in 1970.                              
      Kissing Gate is an older road and
 has larger houses. Four are detached. 
 They were built in 1927.              
      In Church Street, the Foundry    
 Cottage, Cross Keys Cottage and the   
 shop are all 250 years old. But Church
 Cottages are only 10 years old.The    
 original ones were demolished. Cross  
 Keys Cottage was once the village pub.
      Clematis Cottage, on the Main    
 Road, was once the Dame School. All   
 the doors are low and small. The      
 lounge and bedroom were classrooms.   
 The rest was the teacher's house.
