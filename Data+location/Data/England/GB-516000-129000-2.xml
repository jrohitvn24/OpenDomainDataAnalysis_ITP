		<title>02DAY IN LIFE OF Mr L.N.PRICE</title>
		<content> The day begins at 0700 with the TODAY 
 radio programme. I get up about 0710  
 and make tea for the family. By 0745 I
 have washed,shaved and changed.       
 Breakfast is cereal, toast and juice. 
 After final preparations I leave at   
 0820 for the 20 minute drive to work. 
 I work with B.Cal at caledonian house 
 near Gatwick. My work involves        
 planning B.Cal's North American       
 routes. In the morning, I work on     
 reports of route performance and      
 developments, new aircraft proposals  
 and meetings to discuss schedule      
 programmes, budget corrections or     
 estimates of future competitor        
 activity. Lunch is at about 1230: if I
 have to visit our  office in          
 Houston,Texas, I travel to the airport
 for departure at 1240. Usually after  
 lunch I attend meetings or staff      
 briefings.                            </content>
