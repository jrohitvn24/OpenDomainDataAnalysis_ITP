		<content>  Two doctors' practices are housed in 
 this pleasant red brick building which
 was built in 1979.The five doctors    
 each have a surgery but share an open-
 plan waiting room.There are also      
 treatment rooms which are used for    
 ante and postnatal clinics and a baby 
 clinic with posters on the wall and   
 part of the floor carpeted.A sound    
 proof room is used for testing hearing
 and for speech therapy.There is also a
 chiropodist's room.The centre has a   
 friendly,welcoming atmosphere and the 
 facilities are modern and bright. Home
 nurses also use the centre as their   
 base for visiting families in the     
 locality. There are plenty of toilets 
 including provision for the disabled. 
 Car parking for the patients is in the
 front of the building and an entrance 
 hall accommodates prams and push-     
 chairs.                               </content>
