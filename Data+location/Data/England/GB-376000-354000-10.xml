		<content> There are about 5 different clubs in  
 Alsager.These are the Rotary,Round    
 Table,B'hoys for men.For women there  
 is the Inner circle and the Inner     
 Wheel.They all try to raise money for 
 local charities.They do this by       
 holding social events such as         
 bonfires,sports days,and luncheons    
 etc.To join these clubs you need to be
 invited and you will only be accepted 
 if you have a different occupation    
 than the other members.To join you    
 have to pay a membership fee.Which is 
 around Â£35.The membership fee in the  
 Rotary is split 3 ways some goes to   
 charity,some to the president of the  
 club to help world charities,the rest 
 goes to the local section.The local   
 Rotary club was formed in 1974.Each   
 year a new president is elected.
