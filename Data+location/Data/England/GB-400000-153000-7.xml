		<content> On 6th June 1985 two children from St 
 Barnabas School visited Mr Buckle's   
 farm in Oak Lane, Easterton.It was    
 raining so they didn't see much but   
 they did find out something about the 
 farm. Mr Buckle is an{Arable}farmer   
 which means he only grows crops. He   
 keeps animals for pets and poultry to 
 supply the farmhouse. The farm is 70  
 acres altogether, mostly fields.He has
 some land that he can't farm either   
 because its woodland or rough ground  
 which he can't use because he hasn't  
 got any animals to graze on it. Mr    
 Buckle grows wheat for milling,straw  
 for thatching,other straw for potatoes
 and protein peas for animal feed.He   
 spends 80 hours a week working on the 
 farm.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
