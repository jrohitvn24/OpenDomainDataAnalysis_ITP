		<title>06Changing Patterns,Lenches</title>
		<content> Life in the Lenches has changed       
 considerably over the past decade or  
 so. It is now necessary to have one's 
 own transport to get out to the shops 
 and leisure activities. Local children
 must go out of the area to school when
 they reach the age of ten.With the    
 advent of more mechanisation on the   
 land,work has to be found further     
 afield.                               
  The previous agricultural and        
 horticultural population has been     
 more or less replaced by              
 commmuters and people who have        
 retired to the area. It is worthy     
 of note that redundant farm           
 buildings are being converted for     
 housing.                              
    Old words and expressions have     
 almost disappeared. One or two elderly
 inhabitants use words like 'wapper'   
 -wasp and 'hud' -for husk of nut.     </content>
