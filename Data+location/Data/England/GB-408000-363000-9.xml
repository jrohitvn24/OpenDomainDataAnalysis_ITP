		<title>09A Longnor Joiner's Day</title>
		<content>     Philip Kidd gets up at 8 o'clock. 
He gets dressed and feeds the poultry  
and wildfowl.  Then he has his         
breakfast.  He then goes up to the     
workshop to work.  Philip is a joiner. 
He makes stairs, windows, doors, etc.  
Philip has one worker and he pays a    
builder who is building the mill and   
also helps him.  He has a series of    
machines - tenenors, drills, planers,  
bandsaws, etc.  He uses chisels,       
hammers, planes, etc.  All his work is 
done by hand, but in 100 years time it 
will probably be done by machines.     
     Philip buys wood from a company   
but he sometimes cuts trees down       
himself and cuts them into planks      
using a very big saw.  He leaves them  
outside to dry out which will take     
about 6 to 7 years.  He owns a saw     
mill.  The wheel still works.  Philip  
works until about 10 o'clock at night. </content>
