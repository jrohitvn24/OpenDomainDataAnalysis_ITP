 At 8.00 AM I got up and went to work  
 helping Dad.  I unloaded a truck then 
 loaded it again.  At 10 AM one of the 
 drivers went to Holmes Chapel for some
 pies.  At 10.30 AM I went home, got   
 changed and went to Knutsford Swimming
 Club.  At 11.30 AM I got out of the   
 water and met Damian.  We had a talk  
 and then I went home.  When I got home
 I had some dinner and played on my    
 bike.  At 1.00 PM Peter and I decided 
 to go and see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang 
 at Arthur Burgess's Garage and then we
 went to Jodrell Bank.  After that we  
 went to a barbecue in Chelford and we 
 cycled home at 8 PM.  I stayed out    
 until 9 PM and then went in.  I had a 
 play fight with my Dad and went to bed
 at 11 PM.
