		<title>14Energy from Featherstone</title>
		<content> Ackton Hall Colliery is situated at   
 Featherstone.In 1877 two shafts were  
 sunk by Geo Bradley who was the chief 
 landowner.In 1888 it was sold to Lord 
 Hasham and it remained with this      
 family until 1927 when it was aquired 
 by the South Kirby,Featherstone and   
 Hemsworth Collieries Ltd.With         
 nationalisation in 1947 it became     
 under the control of the National Coal
 Board.Until recently 1150 men were    
 employed with an average weekly output
 of 13000 tonnes.Most of the coal went 
 for household consumption although    
 some was sent to power stations.      
 However on Wednesday 3rd July 1985 the
 last coal was cut as the pit is       
 closing down.It has become uneconomic 
 because of geological faults and the  
 loss of faces.The men have been       
 transferred to other local pits and   
 now there is just a skeleton team left</content>
