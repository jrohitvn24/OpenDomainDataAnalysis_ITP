		<title>11Tuesday Market</title>
		<content>    There was a variety of stalls with 
 clothes and food predominating.Other  
 stalls included                       
 jewelry,material,towels and shoes.Most
 of the stallholders lived towards the 
 edge of a twenty mile radius,but a    
 few came from further afield,such as  
 Coleshill in Warwickshire and southend
 in Essex.All the stallholders came to 
 Beaconsfield every week on market day 
 and the majority have been coing since
 the market first started,approximately
 three years ago.In addition to having 
 a stall at beaconsfield every         
 stallholder attended other            
 markets.Again these were widely       
 spread,ranging from local markets,such
 as High Wycombe,to markets at         
 Leamington Spa and Alton.Generally,the
 stallholders were reasonably satisfied
 with the available failities.
