		<content>Children who were still going to       
school would do a small job to earn    
about enough to pay for two or three   
meals for themselves.The children would
be quite well off if their father was a
farmer because he would earn alot more 
money than anybody else.Chidren whose  
father wass a milkman would be lucky as
well because sometimes the milkman     
would get one or two extra pints of    
milk if he worked hard enough.         
   There were lots of other jobs to be 
done in the house like cleaning and    
polishing and washing and drying the   
clothes. It was much more difficult    
to wash clothes during the war it      
also took longer because we did not    
have washing machines.Washing machines 
were not invented until quite a few    
years after the war.
