		<title>20THE DOMESDAY DISC POEM</title>
		<content> In 1985,                              
 A new and better Domesday Book        
 Will come alive!                      
 On disc instead of book,              
 Everyone will be surprised            
 When later on they look               
 Inside the disc Domesday book.        
                                       
 People all over the world,            
 Will see this piece of work,          
 We write until our pens run out       
 And then we put it on the computer.   
                                       
 If it hadn't been for us,             
 No one would know,                    
 How it used to be so long ago.        
 Class 4 of Swaffham Prior School,     
 Studied the parts that they could do, 
 And sent it off to the B.B.C.         
 Where they put it on disc             
 And that's for you and me.
