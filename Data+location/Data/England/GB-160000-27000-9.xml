		<title>09TREGONNING HILL TODAY</title>
		<content> A building plot on the hill 40 years  
 ago would have cost as little as Â£100 
 30 years ago. Today, the same plot    
 would cost Â£15,000.One person who     
 bought a plot decided to build his own
 house. When digging his foundations he
 found a{Quern.}This was a grindstone  
 used around 500 _ 1000 B.C.. Grain was
 poured into a hole in the top of the  
 stone and the stone was turned around,
 while lying on top of another stone.  
     The owner believes that there must
 have been a settlement of some sort on
 the same site as his present house in 
 the past.                             
     The owner of the house used to run
 a youth club 20 years ago for the     
 local children but when these grew up 
 and moved away there was nobody to    
 replace them. In his own words," to   
 all intents and purposes the village  
 is now dead."                         </content>
