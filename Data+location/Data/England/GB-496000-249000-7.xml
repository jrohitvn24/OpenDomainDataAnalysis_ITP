		<content> There were 2 shops in the village,a   
 bakery and a butchers shop and 3 pubs-
 the White Horse and the Dog and Duck  
 are gone, but the Royal George remains
 today.Milk was fetched from Manor Farm
 by older children before they went to 
 school.The school had up to 100       
 children on roll as families often    
 7-12 children.There was a wheelwrights
 business,an undertaker,farrier,clock  
 repairer,and sawpit.Today only the    
 blacksmith remains carrying out       
 wrought ironwork and machinery repairs
 but no farriery.The village also had  
 its own Brass Band.
