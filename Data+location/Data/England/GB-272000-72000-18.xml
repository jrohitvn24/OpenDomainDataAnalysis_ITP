		<title>18FARMING ECOLOGY DARTMOOR</title>
		<content>      At {Southbrook Farm}a dairy herd 
 of 43 {Friesian}cows is kept.The cows 
 are all named e.g.Georgian, Toots etc.
 The farmer built his own milking      
 parlour.It contains 3 machines which  
 take 2 hours to milk 6 cows at a      
 time.The capital investment is not now
 giving the return expected.This farmer
 could produce more milk  but is       
 restricted by E.E.C.quotas.Small farms
 are allowed the same as 1983 but large
 farms' quotas are reduced by 10%. The 
 farm is on the flight path of low     
 level training aircraft.              
      On Elliot's Hill opposite the    
 Hall there is an oak tree planted on {
{June 7th.1977}to commemorate the      
 Silver Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen   
 Elizabeth II.The hill is also of      
 interest because plants unique to the 
 area grow here.They are lobaria       
 pulmonaria and teloschistes flavicans.</content>
