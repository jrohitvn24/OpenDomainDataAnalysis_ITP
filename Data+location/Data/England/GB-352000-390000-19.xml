		<title>19DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSES</title>
		<content>     The housing in our area has       
 changed over the last fifteen years.  
 Most of our area was fields and       
 farmhouses but some of these have been
 replaced and new housing estates have 
 been built.  The area now is a mixture
 of old stone built cottages, modern   
 council estates, pre-war council      
 houses and modern private estates.    
     The houses have many different    
 styles, some terraced houses, some    
 town houses and some semi-detached and
 detached houses.                      
     Some houses have a front garden   
 and a yard at the back of the house.  
 Some have no gardens at the front of  
 the house but a garden at the back and
 others have gardens at the back, front
 and side.                             
     Most houses have central heating  
 and many have double glazing.
