		<title>06STURRY</title>
		<content> Sturry is a dormitory village 3 miles 
N.W. of Canterbury. Its accomadation   
consists of a mixture of houses over   
100 years old and some recently        
developed estates.                     
 The old part of Sturry is divided from
the new part by the level crossing. The
automatic gates cause long delays and  
is a rather off-putting impression for 
continental visitors travelling along  
the A28 from the ports i.e.Folkestone  
and Ramsgate.                          
 Roads and pavements are generally in  
need of drastic repair,and villagers   
would like to see more improvments.    
 There has been a considerable amount  
of agitation over the proposed plans   
of a by-pass.Most people are in favour 
of the idea but there are arguments as 
to where it should be put. Shop owners 
are worried about the drop in trade.
