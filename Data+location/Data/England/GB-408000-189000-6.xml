		<content>{THE POND}                             
          It is 30ft.deep.It has a     
 train carriage at the bottom.The      
 society is thinking of laying track   
 around it,when they have got the      
 money,for children's rides.They have  
 got men tidying it up and planting    
 flowers.These men have been hired     
 under the{Manpower Services Scheme    
 because they were unemployed.         
          I expect they enjoy it       
 because at lunchbreaks and after work 
 they could take a ball to kick        
 around.We saw two teenagers throwing a
 round wooden sign like a frisbee.
