		<title>07Living In The Area 2</title>
		<content>  The population of the area has       
 changed a great deal in recent times. 
 Formally people who lived around here 
 were either born and brought up here, 
 or got a job here, lived here and     
 raised their own families.            
  Today only a relatively small number 
 of the people fall into that group.   
 New houses have been built and these  
 have mostly been bought by people who 
 have moved in from other areas.  Some 
 of the old farm cottages, farm houses 
 and even chapels have been converted  
 by, or bought by people from outside  
 the area.  Sadly, some of the younger 
 people who were brought up here find  
 house prices too high for them to buy 
 a house and have had to move away.
