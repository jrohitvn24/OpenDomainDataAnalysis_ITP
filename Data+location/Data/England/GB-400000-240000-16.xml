     After remaining the same size for 
 many years this town is suddenly      
 growing rapidly.  The new buildings   
 are all on the south side of the town 
 where there is plenty of flat land    
 between the Cheltenham and Broadway   
 roads. The old parts of the town are a
 jumble of different types of land     
 use but here the District Council has 
 planned separate areas for            
     HOUSING  private and council      
     INDUSTRY and warehouses           
     EDUCATION  schools and college

                 squash courts
