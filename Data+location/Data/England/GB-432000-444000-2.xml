 HAREWOOD IS BEST KNOWN FOR 'HAREWOOD  
 HOUSE', THE HOME OF THE EARL AND      
 COUNTESS OF HAREWOOD. HAREWOOD WAS    
 MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL DOMESDAY    
 BOOK OF 1086. 'TOR, SPROT AND GRIM,   
 THREE SAXON CHIEFTAINS, HAD TEN       
 CARACUTES OF LAND TO BE TAXED - A     
 CARACUTE OF LAND AT THAT TIME BEING   
 ABOUT AS MUCH LAND AS COULD BE WORKED 
 BY ONE PLOUGH IN A YEAR'. THE NAME    
 HAREWOOD HAS BEEN GIVEN MANY          
 DERIVATIONS, 'HARE'S WOOD' TO HAERH   
 (ANGLO-SAXON) MEANING A TEMPLE. OLD   
 DOCUMENTS SHOW IT AS BEING SPELLED AS 
 HARWOOD.
