		<content> It is known that the{Benedictines}used
 the spring water for baptism in the   
 16th century and that it has been     
 bottled since 1622.{Holy Well and Eye 
{Well}200 metres up the hill were owned
 by the{Hornyold family}from 1558 to   
 1919. In the 1740's{Dr Wall}publicised
 their health properties and{Wells     
{House}became a hydropath.{Rock House  
 was built as an overflow in 1812.     
{Cuff's}bottled the water from 1919 to 
 1955 but thereafter Holy Well fell    
 into disrepair until major restoration
 under a scheme adopted for{European   
{Heritage Year 1975.}New catchment     
 works have restored the water to its  
 former purity and it can be drunk     
 unfiltered. It never dries up and is  
 scrutinised regularly by environmental
 health experts. The revival of        
 interest in spas has brought many     
 visitors to this fairly remote spot.  </content>
