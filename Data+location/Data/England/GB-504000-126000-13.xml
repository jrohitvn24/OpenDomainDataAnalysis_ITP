		<title>13BEE KEEPING IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> Bee keeping is done in many places in 
 Wisborough Green. My dad is a         
 beekeeper and I sometimes help him.   
   When you are handling bees, you need
 to wear the correct protective        
 clothing: hat, veil, gloves and       
 wellington boots.                     
   Bees are kept in hives which are    
 usually painted white. In one hive    
 there are usually over five thousand  
 bees. The queen is recognised by her  
 size and some people mark her with a  
 spot of paint.                        
    In a hive there is a broad box     
 where the bees are born. A good queen 
 lays one thousand eggs a day, if not  
 more.                                 
    The drones are the same size but do
 not do much apart from eat honey and  
 mate with any new queen.              
                                       
                                       </content>
