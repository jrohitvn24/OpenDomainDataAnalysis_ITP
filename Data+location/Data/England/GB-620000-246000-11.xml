		<content> The villaes contain a mix of old farm 
 cottages, council houses/bungalows    
 built 1930/1960's immediately post    
 1945 houses and a scattering of large 
 pre 1939 houses, paticularly in Great 
 Bealings.  Lt Bealings had substantial
 bungalow development on the edge of   
 the village in 1960s.  A number of    
 more expensive houses built since 1970
 in rushmere, Great Bealings and       
 Playford reflect the type of family   
 now moving into the area but commuting
 out for work.  The new properties are 
 mainly 'infill' as the area is a Green
 Belt for Ipswich.  20 older cottages  
 lack one or more basic amenities but  
 uprading of cottaes is frequent, for  
 use by commuters or as second homes by
 people living and working elsewhere,  
 usually London.  Farm houses are often
 large and prestigious ones owned by   
 non-farmers.                          </content>
