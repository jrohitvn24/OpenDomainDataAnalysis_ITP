June the 29th was warm and windy,but at
least it did not rain.We were glad     
because that afternoon a day to        
remember.                              
    It was Grendon Underwood School's  
Fun Day and we had a lot of things for 
people to do including:                
    Tug o' War,Skittles,Raffle, Welly 
Wanging,Beat The Goalie,Five a side    
Football,The Stocks,Plate Smashing plus
lots more.                             
    The most popular show was the Five 
a side Football match between the      
Grendon Rangers and Marsh Gibbon,which 
Marsh Gibbon won.                      
    It was a very enjoyable afternoon  
and a lot of money was raised.         
    At the end of the day when all the 
people went home,they all looked very  
happy.                                 
                                       </content>
