		<title>12SHOPPING IN WHEATHAMPSTEAD</title>
		<content> One day after school we went down the 
 village to ask some questions.We first
 went in a shop called Fine Fare and we
 asked the manager some questions.We   
 were in there for about 15 minutes.   
 Then we went in the Chemist.The       
 Chemist is a shop that sells hair     
 clips,baby stuff,medicines and other  
 things .It is a very busy shop.       
 Then we walked out of the Chemist and 
 into the Newsagents.Linda introduced  
 us and we asked questions.That shop is
 quite small really but it is nice     
 inside.They sell sweets,              
 magazines,pens,papers,cards and lots  
  of other things.                     
 We walked up the street a little bit  
 and went into the old hairdressers.The
 lady said the dearest haircut was     
 Â£30.00 and that was a perm.We were    
 quite amazed because the Hairdressers 
 only had two hair mousses.{           </content>
