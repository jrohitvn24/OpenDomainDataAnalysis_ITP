		<content> The stretch of the{Leeds-Liverpool  } 
{Canal}on which the man works          
 is about 42 miles long.It stretches   
 between Leeds and Barnoldswick.       
 He told us that during the            
 winter hardly any boats pass along the
 canal but between April and September 
 there are about 6 or 7 boats each     
 day.There are mainly{pleasure craft}on
 the canal.There is no commercial      
 traffic.                              
 The canal has not been{dredged}for    
 some years but they are beginning to  
 dredge it once more.The more boats    
 that use the canal the more damage is 
 caused.There are about 40 men who work
 on that particular stretch of         
 canal.Flooding is very rare.There is  
 quite a lot of{fishing}as well as     
 other activities,such as              
{canoeing}.The canal worker  is based  
 at{Apperley  Bridge,}Bradford.        </content>
