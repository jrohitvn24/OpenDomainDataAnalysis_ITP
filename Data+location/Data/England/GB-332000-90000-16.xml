		<title>16LYME REGIS TOWN CRIER</title>
		<content> The Town Crier, these days, is more of
 a traditional tourist attraction, due 
 to his stunning outfit.  The first    
 Town Crier was appointed almost 200   
 years before the first Mayor making   
 him more important.  The present Town 
 Crier - Mr Richard Fox no longer      
 collects taxes door to door, but      
 organises Fetes and many local events.
 Even in such a small place as Lyme    
 Regis he has still met many people    
 from places as far as Scotland and has
 toured Canada and America a total of  
 29 times.  He meets many of the       
 holiday makers who crowd Lyme Regis   
 every year.
