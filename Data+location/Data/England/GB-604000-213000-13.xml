		<title>13RANGER'S DAY IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>   The Ranger has been at Cudmore Grove
 Country Park for two years. He lives  
 in a newly built bungalow in the      
 park's grounds. He also looks after a 
 100 hectare ancient coppice in Earls  
 Colne. His work is varied and         
 includes:_                            
  Collecting litter from the park and  
 beach every morning ;                 
  Repairing fences that are broken     
 or have been vandalised ;             
  Every 2 weeks he cuts the grass in   
 the park ;                            
  Growing and selling hay which brings 
 in much needed income ;               
  Sometimes sea_erosion of the cliffs  
 means he has to re_position the fence 
 above them ;                          
  He also maintains equipment,paints   
 signposts and periodically plants     
 trees.                                
                                       </content>
