		<content> Water supplies are often a problem in 
 limestone areas as the rock is        
 permeable. However,on the edge of our 
 area a ridge of impermeable gritstone 
 appears and it is here that the       
 reservoir was built in 1908. It was   
 built because the population of Buxton
 was increasing as it became a more    
 popular tourist, residential and      
 commercial centre.                    
 The capacity of the reservoir is{54   
{million gallons.}The area of water at 
 the top is{4.4 hectacres} and it is{  
{9.3 metres}at its deepest point. Some 
 water comes from local streams and    
 some is pumped from a borehole.       
 There is{treatment plant}which employs
 2 men. There water is treated with    
 lime to correct the PH &amp; with chlorine
