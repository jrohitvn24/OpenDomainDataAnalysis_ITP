		<title>02ROYAL AIR FORCE UPWOOD</title>
		<content>  An airfield was first built in 1917, 
 but only lasted for 2 years before it 
 became farmland again. It was rebuilt 
 in 1937 as a base for light bomber    
 squadrons. During World War II        
 Upwood's role was operational         
 training, and over 1500 aircrew were  
 trained here. The station was attacked
 seven times but without serious       
 damage.                               
  In 1961 Upwood ceased to be a flying 
 base and took on an educational role  
 for the R.A.F. A few years ago the    
 R.A.F. moved out and the base is now  
 the property of the U.S.A.F.          
  Whenever the school has a sports day 
 the children are divided into four    
 teams named after Upwood's favourite  
 aircraft: the York, Anson, Canberra   
 and Lancaster.
