		<title>17Picking and Packaging.</title>
		<content> Our area grows large amounts of fruit 
 and vegetables which have to be picked
 and packaged.Perrett's do a lot of    
 packaging.They pack cabbages,salad    
 stuff,onions,cucumbers,calabrese,     
 sprouts,peppers etc. They handle      
 between a hundred and a hundred and   
 twenty tonnes per day.They employ one 
 hundred and eighty people on a        
 permanent basis,but in the summer this
 could rise to four hundred.The women  
 wash,pack and prepare the goods whilst
 the men load,drive and sell the       
 vegetables.The vegetables travel to   
 supermarkets such as Tesco's,         
 Sainsbury's and Littlewood's.         
 Approximately ten lorries leave laden 
 each day.Perrett's also have their own
 land on which they grow vegetables,and
 two farms and nurseries which are run 
 by their own staff.They are important 
 employers in this area.               </content>
