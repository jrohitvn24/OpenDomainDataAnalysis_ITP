		<content> Further along the High Street are a   
 row of thatched cottages.These used to
 be the headquarters of a smuggler     
 named Charles Weeks around 1720.He    
 smuggled in various goods along the   
 Dorset Coast and hid them in Winfrith 
 before sending them onto merchants in 
 London.                               
 Many of the older houses in the       
 village are built of cob(chalk,clay   
 and straw)and have thatched roofs     
 There are 53 thatched roofs in        
 Winfrith.The village is now in a      
 Conservation Area.Several older       
 properties are restored by the Old    
 Buildings Preservation and Restoration
 Trust.As the village is also on Dorset
 County Council's List for development 
 several new houses have been built.   
 care has been taken to fit them into  
 the village style of architecture.
