		<title>16CHILDRENS GAMES.</title>
		<content> Although our primary school children  
 play many of the national  sports e.g.
 football,netball,table tennis,        
 volleyball,rounders,athletics,cricket,
 chess,we were interested in the type  
 of games played in the playground.    
 Having talked with people from an     
 older generation we noticed how some  
 games remained same.e.g.conkers,      
 hopscotch,British Bulldog,skipping    
 rhymes.However it is noticeable that  
 our children either play games with   
 sophisticated equipment or are still  
 able to make up their own games with  
 little or no equipment.In addition    
 there seems to be an increasing       
 proportion of children who need to    
 copy games from television or even    
 find it difficult to play games with  
 others.
