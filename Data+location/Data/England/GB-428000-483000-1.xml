		<title>01BURNESTON AND CARTHORPE</title>
		<content> The land around Burneston and         
 Carthorpe is quite flat, the fields   
 are used for crops, mostly corn.      
 The main road through Burneston is    
 parallel with the A1 so we get some   
 lorries passing. We would like a speed
 limit.                                
 In Burneston there is a primary school
 for 4 to 11 yearolds and there is a   
 playground and playingfield. The      
 playingfield used to be an orchard,   
 and there was a sweet shop where the  
 school now is. The old school near the
 Church is now used as a nursery       
 school, and was built in 1852. In     
 Burneston there was a chapel built in 
 1859, but it is not used now.         
 Carthorpe does not have a Church, but 
 the chapel is used. The old houses are
 of cobble or brick, with slate or     
 pantile rooves.
