		<title>05CATTLE MART  BARNARD CASTLE</title>
		<content> The cattle mart in Barnard Castle     
 takes place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
 each week,when sheep and cattle are   
 sold by auction.First the animals are 
 weighed and marked and then the       
 selling starts at 10am.Farmers watch  
 the calves in the ring and signal to  
 the auctioneer if they want to bid.The
 fat cattle are shown one by one and   
 again the auctioneer's sing song voice
 echoes round the building,only to stop
 when the hammer bangs down.The Farmers
 chat about their crops,animals,       
 families and of course the weather.   
 When buying and selling is done,they  
 go for drinks or have dinner together 
 and the seller gives a small present  
 to the buyer as a bit of luck as      
 is the custom.In the auction mart,the 
 cleaning up begins. All the pens have 
 to be hosed and brushed before the    
 next wagon load of animals arrives.   </content>
