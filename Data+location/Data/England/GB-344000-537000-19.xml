		<title>19HUTTON MARR SCHOOL CLOSURE 2</title>
		<content>   The children were asked to record   
 their views as to the closure of their
 school.  On balance, most looked      
 forward to their new schools, but some
 expressed specific regrets.  One said 
 "I am both happy and sad - I will miss
 Miss Wilson (Headteacher) and the     
 school."  The division of the children
 between two other area schools caused 
 some wry pleasure, in that old        
 'enemies' would be elsewhere.         
   The staff of the school, while not  
 being able to make constructive plans 
 for their own careers while decisions 
 were pending, have succeeded in       
 sustaining an atmosphere which has    
 remained constructive and forward-    
 looking.                              
   The rural community accepts only    
 with regret the end of nearly 250     
 years of teaching in this area, always
 supported by the local people.        </content>
