		<content>{Coastguard:}When someone rings 999 and
 asks for the coastguard,a chain       
 reaction is started.If a plane has to 
 crash land on the beach the coastguard
 comes to secure it and rope it off to 
 stop members of the public playing    
 around it.We get a flood when the wind
 blows in one direction for a longtime 
 and then change direction, thus all   
 the water that was pushed into a pile 
 rushes in towards land.We get a lot of
 pollution caused by oil leaks which   
 are almost impossible to trace.We now 
 have 16 Auxiliary Coastguards and 4   
 permanent ones.There are a lot of     
 false calls to the coastguards.Sutton 
 does not have many trees because the  
 flood in l953 killed many of them     
 off.We used to have some special      
 sandhills here where you could get    
 lugworms for fishing.
