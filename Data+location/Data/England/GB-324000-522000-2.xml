		<title>02Keswick in winter and summer</title>
		<content> The town of Keswick attracts many     
 tourists in summer.We get an average  
 of 176,200 visitors going to the Moot 
 Hall to enquire about accommodation in
 one year.The main attractions are the 
 lakes and mountains.In summer Main    
 Street is a busy place with cars      
 sounding their horns while trying to  
 surge through the crowds.The tourists 
 with packs on their backs make walking
 on pavements hard.Noise from people   
 and cars is immense.The older folk    
 from Keswick are waiting for peaceful 
 winter again.The population in winter 
 is quite low.We have about 5000 people
 in the town but we still get some     
 visitors.Derwentwater sometimes       
 freezes over and the locals skate on  
 the ice.Up on the fells the snow is   
 very attractive and deep.The skiers go
 to Mell Fell when the snow is deep    
 enough.                               </content>
