		<title>05HOUSING IN NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> This area covers two small villages - 
 Netherbury and Stoke Abbott - and a   
 small part of their nearest town,     
 Beaminster.  There is one magnificent 
 Tudor mansion, Parnham, famous now for
 its find Woodwork School.  Homes range
 from large old houses to small        
 cottages, all built in local stone and
 many thatched, with a few modern      
 houses and bungalows, mostly built in 
 stone to blend with the old.  There   
 are also several outlying farms.  On  
 some of the best sites, with lovely   
 views, one finds a row of council     
 houses for renting, though now some   
 are owned by their former tenants.    
 Most homes are privately owned, well  
 maintained and modernised;  some only 
 holiday homes.  2 new groups of       
 retirements flats with wardens are now
 being constructed in Beaminster, one  
 for private sale, the other Council.  </content>
