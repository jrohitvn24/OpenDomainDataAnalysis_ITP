		<content> In England there are four major       
 television channels.They are          
 BBC1,BBC2,ITV and Channel 4.The most  
 popular type of programme on          
 television at the moment is Soap Opera
 A soap opera is a story which closely 
 follows the day life of a family or   
 neighbourhood.Imported American       
 "Soaps" like "Dallas" are very popular
 in this country.They tend to be about 
 powerful and glamorous people. There  
 are also English soap operas,for      
 instance, "Coronation Street",which   
 are much more about down to earth     
 life.Quiz shows are also very popular,
 like "Connections" and "The Price is  
 Right".These give away prizes like    
 cars, caravans and the "holiday of a  
 lifetime".There are also documentaries
 shown on televison such as "The Real  
 World" and "World in Action".
