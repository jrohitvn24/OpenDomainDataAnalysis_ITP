		<content>  It was announced recently that the   
 Railway works would close in 1986.    
 There will be no reprieve this time   
 for the 2,300 workers.This is the end 
 of the line for the Works after years 
 of uncertainty,in the cause of        
 efficiency . This year the Works were 
 to celebrate their 150th. anniversary 
 of high quengineering which had been  
 the hallmark of the G.W.R. Most local 
 celebrations have been cancelled.     
 A council survey predicts a rise in   
 the crime-rate,family disruption and  
 health problems. The unemployment     
 could create a major problem for the  
 town despite the influx of modern     
 light industry.                       
 There has been a number of rallies    
 held,calling on British Rail to change
 their plans, but this is most         
 unlikely.
