           {FARMING}                   
   Mr Freeman who lived on the edge of 
 the village was growing cabbages,     
 sprouts, onions, beetroot and carrots.
 The field behind his holding which he 
 rented, had wheat growing in it. There
 were also some orchards on land       
 sloping down to the meadows.          
 Many of the farm people rarely leave  
 the village except to go to market.   
 One women who went to Cheltenham said 
 that they had taken up the tramlines  
 since she was last there.
