		<content>    The{Quantock Hills}occupy the three
 kilometre squares in the{East}of this 
 Block. They are designated as an      
{Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty}and
 as they rise to over three hundred    
 metres they afford{spectacular views }
 over the surrounding countryside.     
    One{viewpoint}popular with local   
 residents and holidaymakers alike is  
 to be found at{Staple Plain.}To get   
 there you have to take the very steep 
 road opposite Staple Farm. There is   
 a large Car Park situated between the 
{Forestry Commission}plantation and the
{open moorland.  }                     
   From this vantage point there are   
 views over the village of{Williton   }
{towards Minehead and Dunkery Beacon on
{Exmoor. }To the{North}there are views 
 over the{Bristol Channel}with its twin
 islands of{Steep Holm and Flat Holm}to
 the coast of{South Wales.  }          </content>
