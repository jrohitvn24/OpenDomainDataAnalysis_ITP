		<title>20EMPLOYMENT - WOMEN</title>
		<content> The pattern of women's employment in  
 the area is very different from the   
 men's. The children's survey shows:-  
     Mothers' Work Pattern             
 Full time employment (paid)     58%   
 Part time employment (unpaid)   15%   
 At home (housewife unpaid!)     27%   
                                       
     Mothers' Places of Work           
 Loddiswell                      47%   
 Locally outside village         21%   
 Kingsbridge                     21%   
 Travelling widely               11%   
 (Housewives not counted in this)      
                                       
 So it seems that a high percentage of 
 women find work locally, and only a   
 few commute. Local shops, the school, 
 and services provide most employment. 
 Until recently the local Egg Packing  
 and Poultry Station gave plenty of    
 work for women, but it is now closed. </content>
