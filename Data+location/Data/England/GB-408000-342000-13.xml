		<title>13Village shop in Ellastone.</title>
		<content>We interviewed the village postmaster  
who owns the post office and the       
village shop.He delivers newspapers,   
bread and groceries and he has about   
175 customers a day.He gets up at      
6:50 in the morning.He goes 26         
miles a day and delivers to 5          
villages.People would miss their       
deliveries.He said he doesn't like his 
job because he doesn't like seeing the 
same miserable faces  every day.       
During the day he sorts newspapers,he  
sorts the bread,loads the car,has      
breakfast,delivers to Ellastone and    
Wootton and delivers to Roston and     
Snelston.Then has dinner.In the        
afternoon he does bookwork,deals with  
orders,and balances the post office.   
The postmaster thought old people      
would miss their pension being taken   
out to people and the local            
availability of food.                  </content>
