		<title>10HOUSING IN TYNEMOUTH</title>
		<content> Tynemouth grew up as an attractive    
 place for people who worked in the    
 city of Newcastle upon Tyne to live,  
 particularly at the end of the 19th   
 and beginning of the 20th centuries.  
 Many streets of grand terraced houses 
 were built at this time and were the  
 homes of fairly well-off people. A    
 further spate of building occurred in 
 the 1930s. There has been very little 
 building since World War II           
 (1939-1945). In recent years, many of 
 the large terraced houses have become 
 too big for late 20th century living  
 and they have been turned into smaller
 units - flats and maisonettes. Life   
 styles have changed a great deal and  
 people no longer have such large      
 families or servants to warrant the   
 upkeep of a 7 or 10 bedroomed house.
