		<content> Central Luppitt, in an area of        
 outstanding natural beauty, has many  
 small dairy and stock rearing farms.  
 The village, dominated by St Marys'   
 Church, has close links with the      
 Norman Conquest. The manor originally 
 owned by the Flemmings and then the   
 Mohuns is bordered by the river Otter.
 Sir George Carew (whose family later  
 owned the manor) lived here and as    
 vice admiral of the Mary Rose was     
 drowned in 1545 when the ill fated    
 ship capsized near Portsmouth. In     
 1982 this ship was raised and is      
 undergoing restoration. The           
 surrounding countryside comprises of a
 laqrge area of common land, much of   
 which was brought into cultivation    
 during World War II, has been improved
 and is now collectively farmed.
