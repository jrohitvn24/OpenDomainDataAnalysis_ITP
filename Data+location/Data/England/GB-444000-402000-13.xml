		<title>13GOLDTHORPE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Goldthorpe Church is one of the high  
 churches in this district.  Its       
 denomination is{Church of England.  } 
 The congregation on a normal Sunday is
 about{20-30 people.} We have two      
 priests, one called Father Marshall   
 and the other is called Father        
 Matthews.  Father Marshall has been at
 Goldthorpe Church about three to four 
 years now and Father Matthews has been
 here about a year.  The parish has had
 about six priests; one who was old has
 recently died of a heart attack.      
 The nave of the Church has the        
{Stations of the Cross}along the walls.
  The Lady Chapel has just been        
 re-decorated and a new chapel called  
{St. Michaels}has just been built.  A  
 club called the 'one way club' will   
 hopefully be started in{1987. }
