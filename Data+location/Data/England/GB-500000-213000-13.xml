		<content> Father John is a priest with white    
 hair, a white beard and black square  
 glasses. He wears a white collar, a   
 long black robe and a necklace with a 
 metal cross. He cares about the Church
 which nearly always needs             
 repairing.Studham Church was started  
 by Uff in 1220. It has some stained   
 glass windows depicting Bible stories.
 The glass is brightly coloured mostly 
 green, yellow, blue,purple and red.   
 There are wooden pews and many hand   
 stitched kneelers. At the back of the 
 Church is a room where the bells are  
 rung.The tower has 4 old bells _      
 Numbers 1and 2 dated 1666,Number 3    
 inscribed"Pries the Lord 1599" and    
 Number 4" God save the King           
 1627".Father John does not teach      
 scripture at Studham school as the Rev
 Brown did in the early 1900's _Louise
