		<content>    We carried out a survey about 2CR  
 in Bournemouth.                       
    42 people work for 2CR as DJ's etc.
 Before the building was turned into   
 2CR it was an MFI store for furniture 
 and before that it was an indoor      
 bowling green.                        
    They try to follow the same pattern
 every day: Nine hours of records, Nine
 minutes of advertisments per hour,    
 Three minutes of news per hour(local  
 and national),Fifteen hours of        
 infomation.                           
    They broadcast along the South     
 Coast from Weymouth to Lymington and  
 Northwards towards Salisbury.There is 
 a daily potential listening audience  
 of 597,000 people in the 2CR area.    
 Money from the advertising revenues is
 Â£1,200,000 a year.
