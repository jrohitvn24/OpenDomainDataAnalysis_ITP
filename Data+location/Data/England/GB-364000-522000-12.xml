 business is Mr.Ewbank of Broad Lea.

 wagons.When he is busiest he employ's 
 upto nine men but most of the time he 
 employ's only two.                    
    His wagons do long distance work.  
 Kent being the furthest.He transports 
 sheep,cattle and pigs to be slaughter-
 ed.                                   
    He moved out of Long Marton in 1980
 to live at Broad Lea because of the   
 space needed for the lorries and also 
 to be away from neighbours because of 
 the noise.                            
    As well as the lorries his wife has
 four cottages which she rents out     
 either for winter lets or as holiday  
 cottages.

 own dairy milk dilivery.
