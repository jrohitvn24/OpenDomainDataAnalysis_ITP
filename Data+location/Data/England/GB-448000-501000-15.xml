		<content> Faceby is part of the{United Benefice}
 of Carlton, Faceby, Swainby and Potto 
 in Stokesley Deanery and York Diocese,
 served by a vicar resident in Swainby,
 a non-stipendiary minister and three  
 lay readers. On average 10-15 people  
 attend morning worship at St Mary     
 Magdalene Church, fewer at evensong.  
 Alternative Services Book Series 2 is 
 used and services are at 8 am, 11 am  
 or 6 pm, one each Sunday. Faceby      
{Methodist}Chapel, built in 1866 and   
 only a few yards from the church,     
 closed in 1963 and Methodists attend  
 Carlton Chapel. There is one{Jewish}  
 and one{Roman Catholic}family.        
 Although few people attend church     
 regularly, the whole village supports 
 fund-raising efforts for the upkeep of
 church and church hall, a building    
 converted from vicarage outhouses, and
 the only public hall in Faceby.       </content>
