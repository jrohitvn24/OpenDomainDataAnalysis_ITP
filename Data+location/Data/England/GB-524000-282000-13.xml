		<title>13THE UPWOOD WHEELWRIGHTS</title>
		<content> There were two wheelwrights who were  
 brothers.They lived in Upwood and were
 partners in trade.A wheelwright is a  
 person who fits metal rims onto       
 cartwheels.Their house burnt down but 
 they had a metal,gold coloured sun on 
 their house,so if a fire engine was   
 passing by it would stop and put the  
 fire out.If it didn't have a sun on it
 the fire engine would go straight     
 by.There is a new house on the site of
 the old one and the sun has been put  
 on it.The house has caught fire a     
 number of times.On one occasion,a fire
 was caused by a spark which flew up   
 from the road,while people tarred the 
 road.Luckily no-one was killed.
