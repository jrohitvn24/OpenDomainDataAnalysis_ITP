		<title>09CHURCHES IN CHILMARK/TEFFONT</title>
		<content> The{Church of St Margaret of Antioch, 
{Chilmark}is a handsome cruciform{Early
{English}building with an earlier door 
 way. The northern side of the building
 including the aisle arcade was added  
 in{1856.}The congregation averages 25.
 The parish is part of the{Tisbury team
 ministry. The roof will have to be    
 rebuilt in the near future, at a cost 
 of at least Â£15,000. The church spire 
 can be seen from a long way away when 
 approaching the village from any      
 direction.                            
{St Edwards, Teffont Magna,}has{Saxon  
 features, and a nave and chancel in   
 one. The congregation of about two    
 dozen has difficulty in maintaining   
 the fabric. The parish is now combined
 with{Dinton and Barford St Martin}to  
 the east. The Reading Room, a First   
 World War memorial, belongs to the    
 church and is now used as a store.    </content>
