		<content> At the South end of the road,houses   
 were built in the grounds of Stoke    
 Cliff House.One was built in 1935 in  
 the'functional' style.It has a plain  
 front,flat roof,white brick walls and 
 wood-frame windows,except for the new 
 double-glazed patio window.There is a 
 steep back garden which leads up to a 
 thick woods.Robins,squirrels and slow-
 worms come into the garden,once 2 cows
 wandered in to eat the cabbages.The   
 front terrace has lovely rose beds and
 a wide view of Kingswear and the sea. 
 Some houses are Edwardian,they have   
 decorated windows,balconies and       
 gables.The rooms have high ceilings   
 and it can be quite draughty in the   
 winter.The gardens are steep but      
 beautifully kept.One big problem here 
 is parking.We met the road sweeper,who
 said his big problem is dogs.Also,in  
 Autumn he wears out 1 broom in 1 week.</content>
