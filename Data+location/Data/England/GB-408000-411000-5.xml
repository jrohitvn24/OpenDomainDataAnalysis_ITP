		<title>05Dry Stone Walling</title>
		<content> Dry stone walls can only be found in  
 hilly areas and where there are lots  
 of stones.They were built to keep     
 animals in their own fields or if not 
 they would get mixed up.They usally   
 build them with sandstone or          
 limestone                             
                                       
 The sandstone in our area is millstone
 grit,and turns a black colour because 
 of the acids in the rain.             
                                       
 The wall is built up of two sides of  
 stones and rubble in the middle.The   
 foundations are like a house.If one of
 the stones is wobbly you find a small 
 stone which will fit underneath it    
 stopping stone from wobbling.This is  
 called a wedger.
