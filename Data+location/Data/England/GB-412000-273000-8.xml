 Cheswick Way, where we see some new   
 houses being built.We go down         
 Creynolds Lane and see lots of new

 There's a small, old bridge with a    
 shallow steam underneath.We turn right

 a big house,the Vicarage.Now we turn

 big church called St.Patricks Church  
 with the church school beside it.We   
 turn left into Limekiln Lane where    
 there's a pub called  The Bull's Head 
 and an old,pretty cottage built in    
 1911.We turn into Warings Green Road
