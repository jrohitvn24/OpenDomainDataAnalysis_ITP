    Modern farming methods used        
 locally, particularly on the Prestwold
 Estate have changed the appearance and
 size of fields. Original ditches have 
 been replaced by large underground    
 pipes; improving the drainage. Certain
 hedges and trees have been removed    
 increasing the acreage of the fields, 
 enabling the efficient use of aerial  
 crop spraying. Also the unfortunate   
 death of the elms affected by Dutch   
 Elm Disease has also changed the      
 appearance of the land.               
    Herbicides have reduced the number 
 of wild flowers in the arable fields; 
 poppies, corn chamomile and wild oats 
 are now controlled.
