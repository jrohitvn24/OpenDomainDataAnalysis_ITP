		<content> Chillenden is little more than a ham_ 
 let. There is a farriers workshop, a  
 village hall, Kemps Coach depot the   
 village church, a rather dirty duck_  
 pond which doubles as a drainage sump 
 of the road in rainy weather. The     
 Griffins Head is the local pub. The   
 housing is a mixture of several styles
 and different periods. There are two  
 small, newly built areas one of expen_
 sive detached housing overlooking the 
 village; the other set in the valley  
 bottom and made up of medium period   
 detached houses. The remaining houses 
 are of different periods. Close by is 
 Rowling hamlet. It is mainly used by  
 holiday makers in the summer and some 
 students in winter. It is owned by the
 Fox Pitt family of Knowlton. It has   
 few permanent residents.
