		<title>19Sheriff of Buckinghamshire.</title>
		<content>The High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire for
1985-86 works as estate agent for Lord 
Hambleden. His office is situated only 
two minutes walk from the school. He   
was sworn in on 28th March,1985 by a   
Justice of the Peace. This office is   
the oldest office in the country next  
to the monarchy. His job is to hold    
together the administration of the     
county,to keep in contact with the     
judges and support the chief constable 
and police.                            
  There is much social work to do and a
lot of visiting is involved.The        
position provides opportunities to     
visit hospitals and schools to see good
work going on which often goes         
unnoticed.                             
  As there is much travelling and      
entertaining to do,a sheriff has to be 
wealthy but in spite of this,the       
sheriff is proud to have been chosen.  </content>
