 Employment is limited because of the  
 lack of industries so most people are 
 either unemployed ( over 25%),        
 self-employed tradesmen, seasonally   
 employed in Tourism or involved in    
 farming. Other employment is provided 
 by an old people's home, the health   
 centre, the butcher who runs his own  
 abbattoir, the 3 pubs, the school.    
 Residents find employment outside of  
 this block at Goonhilly Earth Station,
 a quarry 2 miles away, 3              
 mini-factories, or Helston 12 miles   
 away.  Some professionals commute up  
 to 30 miles. Fishing is no longer a   
 viable industry and employs only a    
 handful as the waters have been       
 overfished by foreign fleets. A few   
 woman are able to secure part-time    
 employment because of Tourism.
