		<title>09CHURCHES IN OUR D-BLOCK</title>
		<content> In our block there are two very       
 interesting old churches and one new  
 chapel-of-ease.{St.Mary's}is the      
 Parish Church and it was built in l862
 and is a listed bulding.The tower is a
 copy of one in France and you can see 
 it from all over Wythall.There is a   
 big congregation with sunday school   
 and singing groups.The Church Hall was
 a school  from 1840 until 1965. The   
{Baptist Church}was a candle factory   
 until l840 when it was made a         
 church.It is lovely and light &amp; airy  
 inside.The organ is old and comp      
 licated and is up in a balcony.The    
{Catholic church}is the chapel really. 
 It has not got a graveyard so it      
 shares with St.Mary's.The people have 
 spent a lot of money on restoration   
 and building.Before there was a house 
 to have holy services in.{Meadow Green
