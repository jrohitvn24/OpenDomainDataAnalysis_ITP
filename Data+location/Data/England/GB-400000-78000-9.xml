		<title>09A DAY FOR GARETH SWANAGE</title>
		<content>   On Wednesdays I get up at 7.00am, I 
 get dressed and have my breakfast. My 
 favourite breakfast is porridge and a 
 glass of milk. After this I have a    
 wash and clean my teeth. At 8.30 I    
 feed my guinea pig called Snowman. My 
 sister has 3 guinea pigs called:      
 Yummy, Susan and Lynette.             
   My friend's mother gives me a lift  
 to school in their car at 8.45. When I
 get to school I play until the bell   
 goes. Then I go into my classroom and 
 we all say our prayers. We then work  
 on our Domesday Project which I like  
 very much because we visit lots of    
 places and then we write about them.  
 It is great fun to go on the visits.  
   At 10.30 it is playtime. If it is   
 fine we play on the field, but in the 
 winter we play on the playground. We  
 all prefer to play on the field       
 because then we can play football.    </content>
