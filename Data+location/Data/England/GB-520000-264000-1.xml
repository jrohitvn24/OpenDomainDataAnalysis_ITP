		<content> SUMMARY of D Block                    
 This area is situated in the South    
 west of Cambridgeshire and is mainly  
 made up of farmland. It is largely    
 arable land with few trees.Part of the
 area is raised above the valley of the
 River Ouse which runs though the  east
 side of the  area. Running parallel to
 the river is the main London  to      
 Scotland railway line.Running though  
 the centre of the area is the B1043   
 road which goes from St Neots to      
 Huntingdon.There are two villages_    
 Great Paxton to the south and Offord  
 D'arcy to the  north .Each village has
 a school and a church.Great Paxton    
 has no shops now but Offord has one or
 two,so the nearest shopping towns are 
 St Neots and Huntingdon.There is very 
 little  employment in the area.
