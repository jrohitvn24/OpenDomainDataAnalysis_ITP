		<title>05CRANAGE HALL HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>      The hall was designed by Thomas  
 Hall over 200 years ago. When he died 
 it was bought by the Carver family.   
 Eventually the Carver family decided  
 to convert it into a hospital for     
 mentally handicapped patients. Now    
 there are around 300 residential      
 patients and over 100 staff. The old  
 hall is now a nurses home.            
      The hospital grounds are very    
 attractive and have many trees and    
 ponds to make it as pleasant as       
 possible for both patients and staff. 
 The wards are named after the trees,  
 like Maple, Cherry and Birch. The     
 hospital also has its own garages for 
 the hospital transport and            
 maintainance vehicles, and offices for
 administration. The grounds of the    
 hospital cover a large area and some  
 of it is rented out to local farmers  
 for grazing cattle and growing crops. </content>
