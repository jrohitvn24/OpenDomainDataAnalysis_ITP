  As a final exercise the members of   
 the survey-group decided to see what  
 the attitudes were,of children of age 
 12 and 13,to the features in our      
 block.                                
 The majority of those asked felt that 
 the special assets of the area,the    
 bird sanctuary and Piel Castle,were   
 simply "boring!".Children of this age 
 seem to prefer the attractions of the 
 Caravan Park to Local and Natural     
 History.However,many suggestions were 
 put forward to alleviate the          
 dereliction of the South End of       
 Walney.For example,converting the     
 waste-land into a motorcycle scramble 
 track that is run by youngsters in an 
 attempt to prevent vandalism.         
{ }                                    
                                       
                                       </content>
