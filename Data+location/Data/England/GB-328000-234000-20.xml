		<title>20CONCLUSION AND CREDITS.</title>
		<content>   This area, as the reader can gather 
 from the previous pages, is a         
{beautiful though rather isolated part 
{of our country.}The views are really  
 outstanding and there is{plenty here }
{for the tourist}from lovely drives, to
 breathtaking walks, fishing, shooting 
 and a very slow pace of life.The local
 people are friendly and helpful.      
   Each season brings its own wonderful
 sights.The newly born lambs in Spring,
 haymaking and harvesting in Summer,   
 the ploughing and the changing colours
 of the trees in Autumn, and the       
 bleakness and heavy snow falls in     
 Winter.                               
    {The children of Michaelchurch   } 
{Escley C.P.School}carried out this    
 project.They live in this area and    
 thoroughly appreciate their luck.There
 are drawbacks living here but these   
 are outweighed by the pleasures.      </content>
