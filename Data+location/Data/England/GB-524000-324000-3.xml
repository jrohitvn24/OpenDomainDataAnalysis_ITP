{   }Because of the price of land there
 are not large numbers of small farms. 
 It is possible in the future that the 
 sizes of farms will increase as it is 
 only the bigger companies that can    
 afford the high prices of land.       
    In the last 10 _ 20 years there has
 been a tendency for field sizes to be 
 increased in line with machinery size 
 so that farmers could farm their land 
 more efficiently. This trend has now  
 come to an end in this part of the    
 country and we are unlikely to see any
 further increases in the field size.
