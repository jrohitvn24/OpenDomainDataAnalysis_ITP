		<content> Battlesbridge is on the North bank of 
 the River Crouch and is below the 8m. 
 contour line.This part of Essex was   
 flooded in the 1953 floods.Existing   
 sea defences are a minimum of 6.7     
 metres high.The average high tide is  
 5.4 metres though Spring level in July
 1985 was 5.8 metres.This gives 90cms  
 of safety.There have been several     
 floods during the last 10 years,caused
 by surge tides;a trough of low        
 pressure in the channel draws water in
 to a hump making tides higher.Should a
 major flood occur the station would be
 safe though the antique centre,church,
 garage and Hawk Inn would be flooded. 
 Farmland near the river is mostly     
 pasture so would suffer little. The   
 concrete defences need some           
 reinforcement. Residents do not fear  
 another flood.
