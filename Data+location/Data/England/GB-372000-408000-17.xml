		<title>17HAULGH HALL-MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content>  Haulgh Hall in Hilden Street was     
 built about 1600 and was originally   
 inhabited by the Haulgh family. IT is 
 a small manor house which may have    
 included a late Medieval building.    
 It was sold in 1639 to Orlando        
 Bridgeman, the son of the Bishop of   
 Chester who had purchased the Great   
 Lever estate. It was held by the Earls
 of Bradford until it was bought by    
 Bolton Council, who rented it to      
 tenants. Bolton Council have recently 
 restored the property and in December 
 1984 it was bought by Mr. Eden.       
 Part of the building is made from     
 random stones which have a very rough 
 surface and part of it is timber      
 framed with cruck construction. It has
 a small square bay which sticks out   
 like a porch which was traditionally  
 known as the domestic chapel.
