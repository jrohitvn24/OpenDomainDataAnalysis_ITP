		<content> The district is predominantly flat &amp;  
 low lying.   The land is intensively  
 cultivated.   In this decade much of  
 the traditional field pattern has gone
 to be replaced by large open fields.  
 A small area of Burgh Common remains  
 as pasture land with high protective  
 hedges.   The land is mainly in the   
 hands of small family farms.          
 Bugh-Le-Marsh, an ancient settlement  
 stands on an area of high ground      
 rising dramatically from the          
 surrounding marshland.   It dominates 
 the area physically and as a centre   
 for shopping and social life.   It is 
 mainly a dormitory settlement with    
 modern bungalow estates on the        
 outskirts housing visited prople from 
 midland towns.   Nevertheless there is

 Hall and Recreation Centre (formerly  
 the Victorian school) are fully used  </content>
