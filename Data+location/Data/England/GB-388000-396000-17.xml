		<title>17Audenshaw Reservoirs.</title>
		<content> The reservoirs are very popular in the
 summer.They attract sunbathers,besides
 those who like to swim.There is a golf
 club nearby. The reservoirs are over a
 hundred years old.In 1875 an Act of   
 Parliament was passed to allow some   
 reservoirs to be built at Audenshaw   
 and Denton. Although five were planned
 only three were completed.In August   
 1883 they were filled with water.They 
 could hold 1,413,488,434 gallons.The  
 water came from reservoirs at         
 Longdendale. Red Hall and some farms  
 were covered by the water.Red Hall was
 built in 1672 by Ralph Stopford,who   
 had been an officer in Cromwell's     
 army.Its name came from its red       
 brickwork.The reservoirs are regularly
 used by the local people for leisure. 
 There are many canoes and sailing     
 dingies.It is also a favourite haunt  
 for walkers,joggers and fishermen.    </content>
