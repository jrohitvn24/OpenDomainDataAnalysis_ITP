		<title>14FORSTER PARK</title>
		<content>Forster park on one side is pure green 
with loads of dark green trees.On the  
other side it has some pretty yellow   
and pink flowers.There is also a forest
full of leaves on the ground fluttering
 bout.There are plenty of park benches 
 for people to sit on.We also play     
 games in the park like football and   
 rounders.                             
Instead of just the park that you can  
look at there's a park where you can   
play and muck around on swings,slides, 
round-abouts,climbing-frames and       
see-saws.On the other side of the park 
there's a nursery for younger children 
where there is a little paddling pool  
for when it gets hot.This nursery is   
for the ages of 3-5 years old.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
