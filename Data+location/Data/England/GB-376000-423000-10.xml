		<content> Most of the area is{pastureland}      
 belonging to local farmers. Much of   
 the land is over 250 metres above sea 
 level. Farms have decreased in number.
 The pastureland is used mainly for the
 grazing of sheep with a small number  
 of dairy cattle. Lower pastures, below
 300 metres is used to produce 2 crops 
 of hay for winter feed.               
 The area lies on the western edge of  
 the Pennines. Quarrying can also be   
 seen. Local millstone has             
 traditionally been used in the        
 building of local houses and          
 factories. This has resulted in much  
 of the landscape being spoilt but     
 recentely great efforts have been made
 to tidy up the results of past        
 industrialisation.
