		<content> Montsaye pupils did a{Domesday Survey 
 around Desborough and looking at our  
 results it shows that most people were
 pleased with the housing in the area. 
 People we interviewed said that they  
 would like a bigger house. We walked  
 round Desborough asking people about  
 their houses. A few said they either  
 wanted to move or were actually doing 
 so. On the whole most people were     
 pleased to remain here.               
 We went to some really new houses that
 had only been lived in for less than a
 year. They were very pleasant houses  
 but the residents said there ought to 
 be more central heating because in the
 winter it is so cold. Also they said  
 they wished all the houses had a      
 porch.                                
 New houses are still being built on   
 this site which is on the{Braybrooke  
 Road,leading from Desborough.         </content>
