		<title>10SANDY'S PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>  ST.SWITHUNS IS THE PARISH CHURCH OF  
 SANDY, IT IS IN THE HIGH ST. THE      
 RECTOR IS MR E ROWLAND.               
  THIS PARTICULAR CHURCH WAS BUILT     
 ABOUT 1860, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A      
 CHURCH ON THE SITE FOR ALMOST A       
 THOUSAND YEARS. THE CHURCH IS VERY    
 BEAUTIFUL AND MR ROWLAND OPENS IT UP  
 EVERY MORNING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LOOK 
 ROUND AND PRAY QUIETLY. SERVICES ARE  
 HELD EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. THERE IS  
 ALSO A SUNDAY SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN AT  
 10am EVERY SUNDAY.                    
  THERE ARE SIX BELLS IN THE CHURCH,   
 THEY WERE INSTALLED ABOUT 1885. MR    
 ROWLAND HAS TO FIND PEOPLE TO RING THE
 BELLS ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.           
  WHERE MR ROWLAND'S HOUSE IS NOW, IS  
 THE SITE OF THE OLD RECTORY, AND THE  
 RECTORY ROOMS WHERE THE SUNDAY SCHOOL 
 IS HELD WERE ONCE STABLES.
