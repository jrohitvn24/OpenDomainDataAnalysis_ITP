		<title>02Fawley Church</title>
		<content>  Fawley Church is very old the Normans
 built it in 971 A.D. The oldest piece 
 of furniture is a paten which was     
 given to the church by the Bishop     
 of Winchester in 1350.The church was  
 the largest place in the village of   
 Fawley.They held many things there    
 like,school lessons,parties and even  
 markets.After the market they lifted  
 up the pews and put all the mess the  
 animals made into a hole under the    
 floor.                                
    Of the many tombstones which may be
 seen in the churchyard one belongs to 
 a local hero called Samuel Kinkead who
 whilst trying to break the air speed  
 record lost his life.In the church    
 there is a seventeenth century chest  
 which was used to keep official       
 documents.In the second world war the 
 church was bombed but by luck it      
 survived.                             </content>
