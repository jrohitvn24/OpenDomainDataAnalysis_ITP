		<title>12Upper and Nether Padley</title>
		<content> Around the Grindleford station, the   
 area of Upper Padley is actually in   
 the civil parish of Hathersage. The   
 London, Midland and Scottish Railway  
 actually brought about a growth of    
 residental property in this area, and 
 the tunnel now known as the Totley    
 Tunnel cost Â£75 per yard to build, and
 due to the solid underground gritstone
 and the presence of water, only about 
 20 yards per week were tunneled.      
 Padley Mill, once a large saw mill    
 built on the Burbage brook, is now a  
 private house. Nether Padley, being   
 further down the hill towards the main
 Grindleford village centre, is a      
 difficult name to define.  In old     
 English, the word 'PADDE' meant toad, 
 and 'LEAN' was a clearing in a wood.  
 However, many a persons name was used 
 in the naming of a particular area.
