		<content>    Each year at Village Day which is  
 always held in the middle of June     
 there is a display of dancing or      
 costumes based on a special theme.    
 This year-1985-the theme was Carnival 
 and everybody was encouraged to dress 
 up in carnival costume. The three main
 countries on display were Mexico,     
 Greece and Nepal. Greece was used     
 because we have a number of Greek     
 children in our school and they had   
 costumes and could show us how to do  
 Greek dancing. Nepal was chosen       
 because the village has a friendship  
 link with that country.               
    Mexico was the main country because
 some of the classes had been doing a  
 large project on Mexico with the help 
 of a Mexican lady and her husband.    
 They taught us songs and dances and we
 were able to dress up in real Mexican 
 costumes.                             </content>
