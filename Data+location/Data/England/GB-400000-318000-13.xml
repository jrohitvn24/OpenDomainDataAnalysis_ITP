		<title>13The Canal And Waterworks.</title>
		<content>The other day we went down to the      
waterworks which is the Brindley Bank  
Pumping Station. We use the water for  
drinking, in other words it is a water 
supply. From 1905 until 1968 the water 
was pumped by a steam engine but now it
is pumped by electricity. The bore hole
is about 165m deep down under the      
earth. The Trent and Mersey Canal is   
used for pleasure. It is used for      
boating and fishing and there is a tow 
path for walking on. The Bloody Steps, 
which go down to the canal, are called 
that because in 1839 Christina Collins 
was murdered on a boat. Her body was   
found next morning in the canal. Her   
body was carried to Rugeley up the     
steps. So from that day on we call the 
steps 'The Bloody Steps'.The men who   
murdered her were either transported to
Australia or hung and Christina        
Collins is buried in Rugeley.          </content>
