		<content> The Parish of Warbleton has a Parish  
 Council consisting of 11 Councillors  
 who meet six times a year in the      
 Dunn Village Hall. The main items of  
 business are planning matters with    
 particular reference to the illegal   
 siting of caravans, the maintenance of
 footpaths and the upkeep of the green 
 and car park at Rushlake Green, both  
 of which belong to the Council. Road  
 safety, the retention of public       
 telephone boxes and civil defence are 
 all matters which have been raised at 
 meetings during 1985. Although the    
 meetings are open to the public,      
 rarely do more than a few attend. The 
 Council employs a part-time Clerk who 
 draws a salary of Â£550 per year, but  
 it pays neither the time nor expenses 
 of Councillors. Its activities are    
 financed by a Parish Rate and its     
 current annual budget is around Â£1700.</content>
