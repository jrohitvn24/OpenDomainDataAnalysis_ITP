		<title>05The Frome Valley Walkway</title>
		<content> The River Frome flows through our area
 and along its banks is the Frome      
 Valley Walkway which stretches from   
 Frenchay to Iron Acton. The name      
 'Frome' is derived from an old word   
 meaning 'fast flowing'. Taking this   
 attractive path you pass many historic
 sites including the remains of several
 old mills,though in many cases it is  
 only the weirs that remain. The river 
 runs under the Winterbourne Viaduct,a 
 fine example of a Victorian railway   
 bridge. It has eleven magnificent     
 arches and is almost thirty metres    
 above the river. Many people who use  
 the walkway do so to exercise their   
 dogs. They also go to enjoy the       
 wildlife and peaceful atmosphere.     
 Besides the locals, people from many  
 other areas make use of this path.    
 Sometimes people from other countries 
 visit it whilst sight seeing.         </content>
