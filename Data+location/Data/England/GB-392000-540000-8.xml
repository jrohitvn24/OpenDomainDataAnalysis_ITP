      The farms vary in size from      
 approximately forty to three hundred  
 acres, all have rough grazing or fell 
 'hefts' of varying sizes on which     
 Swaledale sheep are bred _ these being
 usually the biggest single source of  
 income. Enough pure Swaledales are    
 bred to provide replacements and keep 
 the herd numbers steady, the remaining
 Swale ewes are put to the Blue Faced  
 Leicester tup to produce the Mule     
 sheep. These Mules are very much in   
 demand for breeding as they combine   
 the hardiness and good mothering      
 ability of the Swaledale with the     
 prolific and milking abilities of the 
 Leicester. The Mule gimmer lambs are  
 sold at the autumn sales; many find   
 their way to the southern counties for
 breeding early maturing lambs.
