		<content> The churches of Marlborough have      
 covenanted to form an ecumenical      
 parish, and to do nothing             
 separately that could be done         
 together. The team is (Anglican)      
 Rev. Canon W.Down, Team Rector; Rev.  
 M.Cripps, Priest Assistant of St.     
 Mary's Church; Rev. Colin Fox (Team   
 Vicar of Preshute and Mildenhall) Rev.
 R.Marsh and Rev. D.Dales (Chaplain and
 Assistant Chaplain of Marlborough     
 College); Rev. G.Gordon, Minister of  
 Christchurch (Methodist and Reformed  
 Church) and Father T.Kelly, Parish    
 Priest of St. Thomas More (R.C.). The 
 team works closely with the Society of
 Friends, and the covenanted members   
 renew their covenant annually.        
 It is interesting to note that St.    
 Peter's church in the High St. (now   
 deconsecrated )is the church in which 
 Cardinal Wolsey was ordained.         </content>
