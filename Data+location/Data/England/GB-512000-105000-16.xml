		<title>16DURRINGTON-CONFLICTING VIEWS</title>
		<content> Mrs Osborne,resident of Durrington,   
 says that at present she likes her    
 area as it is a suburb of Worthing,   
 close to Arundel and the West.However 
 she dislikes the mushrooming          
 developments of small box-type houses,
 lack of access roads and increasing   
 traffic load.Insufficient shops,      
 except Tesco's supermarket, leads to  
 overcrowded pavements and enforced    
 queues in this area of housing        
 explosion.                            
 Four residents of Durrington were     
 questioned.Three had moved to the area
 in the last two years but one did so  
 40 years ago.The people liked the     
 quietness and the convenience of      
 shops.The noisy roads were the only   
 thing disliked.The only changes       
 noticed were the buildings.Their      
 overall impresion was that of a quiet,
 pleasant residential area.            </content>
