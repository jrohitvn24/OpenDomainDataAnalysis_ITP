 This ancient Egyptian craft was to    
 keep the Goddess of the Harvest safe  
 during the winter. Special wheat is   
 grown in Oxfordshire for this craft.  
  This area used to make straw bonnets 
 but cheaper imports have killed this  
 industry. Although plaiting schools   
 have died out the displays we saw     
 showed it is becoming increasingly    
 popular as a hobby. The examples we   
 saw included:                         
 A Glory Braid with one staw for each  
 Apostle;Harvest Crosses;Love Favours  
 to be given to a sweetheart;hedgehogs;
 cages;mice and a baby's rattle. Our   
 school has a chair with a backing     
 weaved from Black Oats from Orkney.
