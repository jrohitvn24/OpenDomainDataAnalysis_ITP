		<title>17YORKSHIRE DIALECT - DEWSBURY</title>
		<content> Language experts think that over the  
 next 50 years{dialects will disappear 
 as exposure to television and         
{computerised voices}increases. A      
 survey was carried out to see if the  
 Yorkshire dialect was dying out in the
 Dewsbury area. 24{'Yorkshire'}words   
 were chosen at random, some old, some 
 in common use eg.{beck, gill,         
{maungy,causey and smittled}and then   
 pupils, parents and grand-parents (all
 born  and raised in Yorkshire) were   
 asked to define them.                 
{Results:-}average number of words     
 known: by pupils - 10; by parents -   
 17; by grand-parents - 21. This       
 provides{strong evidence}that the     
 Yorkshire dialect is dying, a         
 regrettable fact as experts agree it  
 contains words dating back to{Saxon   
{times}and as such gives us a direct   
 link with our ancestors.              </content>
