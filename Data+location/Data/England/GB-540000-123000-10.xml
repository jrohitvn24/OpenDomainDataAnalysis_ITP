		<title>10FLETCHING BONFIRE SOCIETY</title>
		<content> Fletching Bonfire Society was founded 
 in 1854. There are 25 members and a   
 committee of 20. They raise funds all 
 year, and expect to raise Â£500 for    
 fireworks this year. Bonfire night    
 will be 26th October. The men dress as
 civil war confederates or union       
 soldiers, the women as southern belles
 . They process through the village    
 from end to end then assemble at      
 Cherry Tree Council Estate for a      
 firework display and bonfire. As      
 village bonfires are very much a      
 Sussex tradition, different costumes  
 being chosen by each village society, 
 many other bonfire societies join in  
 the parade. This year there will be{  
{Lindfield},{Burgess Hill},{South      
{Street Juveniles Lewes},{Newick}and { 
{Hailsham}Societies plus 2 bands, the  
 Guy and the Societys banner. All carry
 flaming torches an impressive sight.  </content>
