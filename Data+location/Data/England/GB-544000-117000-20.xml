		<content>   An interview with the local Water   
 Bailiff:                              
  "The section you see in front of you 
 is fairly typical of a{lowland river. 
 Two years ago it was so overgrown with
 fallen trees that something rather    
 drastic had to be done to prevent the 
 channel from becoming blocked &amp; flood-
 ing adjacent farmland. It entailed the
 cutting back of a number of trees so  
 that the roots were left, but this is 
 not always possible.                  
   This river bank looks{natural.}You  
 can see the new growth coming from the
 stool or stump of the Alders. It need 
 not be touched for another twenty     
 years or more. I try to get the River 
 looking as I like to see it; the banks
 aren't laid bare but have plenty of   
 flora and fauna."
