		<title>18Deepcut Village</title>
		<content>   Our village has very few shops, but 
 it has two churches, one Catholic and 
 one Church of England. They are army  
 churches so they have Chaplains       
 instead of vicars. There is a         
 tattooist in the village. Most of his 
 customers are soldiers. Most of the   
 trade with the takeaway food shops is 
 also from soldiers.                   
   The village is busy with cars going 
 up and down the main road. About 2000 
 people live in Deepcut village. Most  
 of them are not in the army, but many 
 have jobs with the army. My dad works 
 for{Marconi,}an electronics firm in   
 Frimley.                              
   Some residents are old age          
 pensioners or retired army people.    
   There is plenty of open space in the
 village which includes a park with    
 swings, a roundabout and a climbing   
 frame.                                </content>
