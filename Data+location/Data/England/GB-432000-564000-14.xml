		<content> An agreement between the{Port Of Tyne 
 Authority and{Tynegrain}Ltd.resulted  
 in a new grain terminal being built.  
 The Authority installed fast ship-    
 loading equipment and Tynegrain       
 provided the 31 silos with a storage  
 capacity of 26,000 tonnes.The dryers  
 and conveyors can process and dry     
 grain immediately upon harvesting and 
 export 40,000 tonnes in 12 weeks.     
{Coal}no longer dominates the trade of 
 The Tyne but it is still the largest  
 single item in the trade of the port. 
 A new Â£9m. coal handling plant opened 
 in 1985 at{Tyne}Dock.The plant is fed 
 by rail and discharges from trains on 
 to a conveyor belt and ships can be   
 loaded at the rate of 2,000 tonnes per
 hour.                                 
{Westoe Colliery}is connected to Harton
 Staithes where nearly 2m tonnes of    
 coal and waste is shipped per annum.  </content>
