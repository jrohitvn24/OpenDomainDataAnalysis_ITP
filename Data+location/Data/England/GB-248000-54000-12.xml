		<content> Efford Cemetery is one of the two main
 cemeteries in Plymouth, maintained by 
 the City Council. There are 13,500    
 grave spaces, but there have already  
 been 28,750 burials there since it was
 opened. This means that each grave    
 space has been used at least twice.   
 There are about 200 burials annually. 
 Most people are cremated when they die
 and there are about 1,500 cremations  
 annually. People prefer cremations    
 because it does not use up a lot of   
 ground, and the ashes of relatives can
 be saved in a special urn. There are  
 two memorials in the cemetery - one to
 the civilians killed in the 2nd World 
 War, and the other to the members of  
 the Armed Forces cremated at Efford.  
 The oldest grave we could find dates  
 from the middle 1800s.
