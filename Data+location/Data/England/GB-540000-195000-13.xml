		<title>13My Family</title>
		<content> My name is Lawrence Mann. There are   
 four people in my{family,}my dad,my   
 mum,my sister and me. We live on an   
 estate at the north end of Loughton.  
 My dad drives to the station and then 
 goes to work in London. My mum doesn't
 go out to{work}but stays at{home}and  
 does the house work. My dad leaves at 
 8.00am and comes home at 6.00pm, some-
 times later. We rarely go out except  
 on birthdays.                         
 Because my mother is German every year
 the whole family goes to Germany at   
 least once, some times three times to 
 visit relations. Every two years we go
 across to Germany at Christmas and New
 Year.My sister enjoys{playing}the     
 piano and flute and spends a lot of   
 time reading books. She attends the   
 Davenant Foundation School, and in a  
 year I will be going there for 6 or 7 
 years schooling.                      </content>
