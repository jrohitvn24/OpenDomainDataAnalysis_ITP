		<content> The survey block is dominated by      
 farmland.                             
 The smallest farms in the area are    
 about 75-125 acres. They are really   
 large smallholdings,worked just by the
 families that own them. All farms are 
{freeholds.}Only one farm has been     
 taken over by a financial institution.
 The largest farms are about 1000      
 acres: Shepherds' Farm, Ashwell and   
 the Farr's farm, Newnham. There are   
 4/5 farms in the middle range.        
 The main{cash crops}are winter wheat  
 and barley. Some grow peas to break   
 the rotation. The bigger farms also   
 give a small acreage to{soft fruit    
{like raspberries and}strawberries.    
 These are picked by casual labour from
 Ashwell or sold on a "Pick-Your-Own"  
 basis. Farrows Farm, Ashwell also has 
 a herd of some 3000 fat pigs.
