 151 acres: 10acres potatoes,15 acres  
 carrots,100acres barley,the rest      
 hay.He runs the farm with his two     
 sons.They keep two milking cows for   
 the house the rest are beef cattle.The
 farm used to have 100 sheep but these 
 were sold last year.He does not keep  
 hens because there are too many foxes 
 on the Moss.The number of beef cattle 
 varies from 45 to 100 depending on    
 housing and money for buying them     
 in.They are kept in barns and are fed 
 intensively on barley,soya bean       
 meal,fish meal,straw and hay.They are 
 mainly Hereford or Angus cattle with  
 dairy cow mothers.They are killed when
 they are a year old.They would need to
 be kept for 18months to 2 years if    
 they were outside.They are sent to    
 Chelford for slaughtering, usually    
 on Thursdays.                         </content>
