		<title>02the Fleetwood Landmark</title>
		<content> This strange structure was erected    
 in 1740 by the Lancaster Commissioners
 to guide ships to Lancaster Port and  
 Glasson Dock. It was a large wooden   
 pyramid sited in a field on Rossall   
 Grange Farm close to the sea, a mile  
 from Rossall Hall. One of these land- 
 marks was washed away by the strong   
 and stormy weather off Rossall Point. 
 The landmark was called 'The Rossall  
 Landmark'. The Reverend St Vincent    
 Beechey, with a maths teacher from    
 Rossall School witnessed 'the beacon' 
 topple over into the sea. When the    
 lighthouses took over and the Beacon  
 was disused,it became a popular place 
 for young people. The last landmark 60
 ft bit the sand in 1924, when a local 
 merchant bought it for firewood. Sunk 
 without trace and still sinking the   
 huge iron cage awaits discovery. All  
 that remains is a circle of stumps.   </content>
