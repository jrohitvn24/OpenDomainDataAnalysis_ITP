  The Woodstock Museum is in the town  
centre. It is a good place to go on a  
wet day.Thirty seven helpful people    
work there in the different            
sections. The exhibits are kept at a   
constant temperature and humidity by   
chemicals. On average, 73,429 people   
come to visit the museum each year. It 
has many valuable exhibits, such as    
wall paintings, a penny farthing, and a
tomb. There is also a Sites and        
Monuments Record which keeps a         
record of all the old buildings in     
the county and any archaeological      
finds. The security there is so good   
that there is no possible chance of    
anybody breaking in! The museum lends  
out exhibits to schools. There is a    
nice coffee bar, shop and a garden. It 
is a very pleasant place.
