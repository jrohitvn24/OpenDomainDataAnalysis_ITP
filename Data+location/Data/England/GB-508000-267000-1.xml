   This block contains most of the     
 parish of Kimbolton. At its centre    
 lies the former market_town (present  
 population 1100) nominated a          
 conservation area of special interest 
 because of its church, its castle and 
 its collection of timber_framed       
 houses. It is also{a Rural Service    
{Centre} and has grown steadily over   
 the past 20 years, while retaining its
 compact medieval plan.{The A45 trunk  
{road to the East Coast ports at       
{present carries too much heavy traffic
{for comfort.}Most of the block,though,
 is agricultural land surrounding this 
 nucleus.                              
   There are 387 houses in the         
 parish,333 of which are privately     
 owned.21% of the population is under  
 16,17% are pensioners.81% of          
 householders own cars (1981 census)   </content>
