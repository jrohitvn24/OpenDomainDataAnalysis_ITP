		<title>02Tadcaster Local History</title>
		<content> Tadcaster is steeped in{local history.
 The{Romans}named the town Calcaria,   
 which is a reference to the hard      
 limestone on which the town stands.   
 Tadcaster was used by the Romans as a 
 staging post on the way to York. They 
 built a castle on what is now called  
 Castle Hill. The arrival of the       
{railways}in the 1840s took much of the
 coaching traffic away from the town   
 but the{breweries}began to develop.   
 The viaduct was built in 1849 by      
 George Hudson to carry the York line  
 over the River Wharfe, but the line   
 was never completed and the viaduct is
 used as a footpath. The first stone   
 church was built about 1150 AD. The   
 church flooded a lot and so it was    
 rebuilt five feet higher and reopened 
 in 1877.
