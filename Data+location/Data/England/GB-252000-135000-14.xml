		<content>      Cream teas are very popular in   
 this area.The church hall is used by  
 the church members to provide cream   
 teas for visitors to the gardens and  
 to make some money for the church.Many
 people make their own clotted cream by
 heating creamy milk slowly and then   
 leaving it to cool in the fridge      
 overnight.You can then take the cream 
 off which is like a crust.Cream as    
 well as being put on fruit and cakes  
 is also put on scones and soft rolls  
 with jam(cut-rounds.)People bake their
 own yeast cake and make potato cake   
 Some of the older people call         
 dumplings "dough boys".There is a lot 
 of fruit and flowers in the area so   
 many make their own wines and         
 non-alchoholic drinks like elderflower
 champagne.
