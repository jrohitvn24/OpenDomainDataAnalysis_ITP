		<content> The main London to Edinburgh{railway  
{line}runs through this area. A train  
 passes every 5 minutes each way. The  
 125's use this line at top speed.     
 There used to be a{station}at Moss.   
 This was because of the brickworks    
 near by and because of the visitors to
 the spa town of Askern only 2 miles   
 away. The station was closed in the   
 1950's. The A19 or the{Great North    
{Road,}which was the main roadway      
 before the motorways, passes through  
 this area. The original{toll bar      
 built in the 1700's is still to be    
 seen. It is now a petrol station and  
 shop. Travellers had to pay at the    
 toll bar to be able to travel on the  
 next section of the road.
