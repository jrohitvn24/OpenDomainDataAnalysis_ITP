		<title>07Whiteley Village-other facts</title>
		<content> Other buildings in the village include
 3 churches, a hospital and offices.   
 A few people do not like the village  
 and leave after a few weeks, but most 
 stay there for the rest of their      
 retirement. They do not have to be    
 retired shop workers any more. Anyone 
 can apply to live there as long as    
 they are fit and healthy on arrival.  
 One rule is that residents can only   
 leave the village for a few days each 
 year, so that no-one can use their    
 cottage like a holiday home.          
 Now that more residents have cars     
 there is a plan to build some garages.
 The old air-raid shelters are used by 
 many people as garden sheds.          
 The old people really enjoyed talking 
 to us. They gave us sweets and        
 oranges, and told us that we were very
 well behaved and to come again to see 
 them.                                 </content>
