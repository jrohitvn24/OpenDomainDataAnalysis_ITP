		<content> There are two state schools in our    
 area,one in Steeple Ashton,in the High
 Street and one in Keevil in the Main  
 Street.Both schools were founded by   
 the Church of England; Steeple Ashton 
 in about 1820 and Keevil in about     
 1870.Both schools are small, under 60 
 children in each.                     
      Most children attend the village 
 schools from the age of five to eleven
 but some children go to private (fee  
 paying) schools in nearby towns.      
      At the age of eleven children    
 transfer from the village schools to a
 school in one of the nearby towns:most
 children go to Clarendon Comprehensive
 School at Trowbridge.They stay at     
 school until at least sixteen,some    
 until eighteen.At sixteen or eighteen 
 children may leave school and either  
 start work or go on to some further or
 higher education.                     </content>
