		<title>13The Bowling Club.</title>
		<content>  The Club is a hive of activity in the
 Bowling season from the end of April  
 to the end of September. There are{150
{men and 90 lady playing members}as    
 well as many social members.          
  The Club is run by all the members,  
 (who are mostly retired), working     
 together on a rota basis. The smart   
 and spotlessly clean Clubhouse was    
 built mainly with money left to the   
 Club when a member died, but some     
 money from the Council was needed.    
  As the ground is such a sun-trap, it 
 gets very warm by the Greens and so   
 the matches attract spectators by the 
 dozen.                                
  The most famous people who have      
 played at the Club are{County players 
 and{Middleton Cup players.}The        
 Middleton Cup is the most prestigious 
 inter-county competition.
