		<content> Farming.                              
       Until twenty years ago, some    
 farmers used horses and employed teams
 of men. In recent years there has been
 a switch to greater cereal production.
 This, and mechanisation has meant that
 far fewer men are employed in farming.
       The old pattern of small mixed  
 farms has changed. Only one working   
 farm remains in Nawton and two in     
 Wombleton. Some villages have         
 smallholdings and do some part-time   
 farming.                              
       Land is gradually been bought up
 by large landowners. One major        
 landowner has begun to let farmhouses 
 which were once tenanted as holiday   
 homes. This landowner has retained the
 land and turned it over to cereal     
 production and contractors are        
 employed.                             
                                       </content>
