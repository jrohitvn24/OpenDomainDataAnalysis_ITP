		<title>05The Parish Church part 2</title>
		<content>   The parish registers have been kept 
 regularly since about 1559 and it is  
 interesting to note some of the names 
 so well known in our village today :_ 
 Thurgood,Page,Mott,Pickett and Knight.
   In 1641 the church was raided by    
 George Thurgood to destroy the        
 coloured figures in the stained glass 
 windows. This raid was instigated by  
 the Puritan John Skringle. The        
 communion rails were also destroyed   
 and the church plate and bells were   
 stolen. Finally the church walls were 
 whitewashed.                          
   In the second half of the 17th      
 century we find records of people     
 being "buried in woollin", this made  
 compulsory by Act of Parliament in    
 1666 to help the wool trade. Any      
 departure from this incurred a fine of
 Â£5.
