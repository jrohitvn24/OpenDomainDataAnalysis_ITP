		<title>06UNEMPLOYMENT IN HAVANT</title>
		<content>  Today,July 1985 there are over 3     
 million people out of work.This has   
 been caused by two major factors.The  
 first is the closure of large_scale   
 industrial factories;the second the   
 increasing use of computers in        
 business.In the Havant area there are 
 about 4 thousand people without jobs. 
 The Government have set up a scheme   
 to help the young people who have not 
 got jobs.It is called the Youth       
 Training Scheme.School leavers can go 
 on to the scheme for a year.In this   
 year they start to learn a trade and  
 some companies retain them on a       
 permanent basis.They get Â£25 a week.  
  From the school leavers at           
 Warblington 19 of them are going on   
 the YTS,83 of them are going on to    
 college,18 of them have jobs to go to 
 and 24 of them are unemployed.
