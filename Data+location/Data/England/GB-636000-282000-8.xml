A little school with grace and charm,  
Has stood a hundred years,             
Children have laughed and cried and    
sung,                                  
Through endless years of toil and fun. 
                                       
Hopscotch, hoopla, spinning top and    
tag,                                   
Have all been played in the old school 
yard,                                  
In the classrooms the children must    
work                                   
For their lessons they must not shirk. 
                                       
All those who've been to this little   
old school,                            
Remember their days with respect and   
esteem.                                
They've all played their part,         
AS members of our great school team.
