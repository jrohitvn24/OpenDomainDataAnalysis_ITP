		<content>   There was not as much entertainment 
 then as there was today. There was a  
 Dance Hall near the harbour. People   
 amused themselves by playing penny    
 machines &amp; looking at machines called 
 "What The Butler Saw." They showed    
 pictures of sexy men &amp; women. There   
 were also telescopes along the        
 sea-front &amp; for 1d you could look     
 through them for 1 minute. At this    
 time there was no Punch &amp; Judy        
 show. There was a bandstand on the    
 cliff where military bands played     
 popular songs &amp; excerpts from operas. 
    Ice-creams were 1/2d &amp; 1d each.    
 There was no candy floss or popcorn   
 but seaside rock &amp; candy was cheap.   
    William Fleming was a life-boat    
 man, who after retirement gave        
 tourists trips in his boats.
