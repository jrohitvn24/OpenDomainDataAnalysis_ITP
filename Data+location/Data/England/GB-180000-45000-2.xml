		<content> Apart from the two main areas of      
 population, i.e. village at           
 Shortlanesend and edge of Truro City, 
 the area is rural with smallholdings  
 and farms, building is sparse. However
 there are some places that are being  
 developed for housing. The buildings  
 that exist are chiefly{residential,   
 with{commercial buildings}dominating  
 in the city.                          
                                       
 Three main link{roads}come into the   
 block from St.Austell, Bodmin &amp;       
 Newquay and Perranporth.              
 The main{British Rail line}from       
 Paddington to Penzance passes the S.E.
 corner, through cuttings and over     
 viaducts. At{Buckshead}the train      
 travels through a tunnel over 300     
 metres long. The train engines are    
 powered by diesel oil.
