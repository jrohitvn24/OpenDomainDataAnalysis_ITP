		<content>{This is an ordinary school day}in the 
 summer as described by a girl aged 11 
 living in the village.                
{At 8.00,}I get up , make the bed and

 school. At 8.25, I do my hair and go  
 to school. I arrive at school at 8.40 
 and the bell goes for work to start at
 9.00.                                 
{In school,}we have a morning assembly 
 and then I do some Maths and English  
 but we have a break at 10.30 when we  
 play games. At 12.00, it is time for  
 lunch and at 1.30 we go back into     
 school to start work.                 
{We go home}at 3.30 and from 3.45 to
