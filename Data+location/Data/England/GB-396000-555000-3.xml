		<content> The farms in this area range in size  
 from about 30 acres to 500 acres and  
 cover a range of enterprises, the most
 common being {milk production}for the 
 Milk Marketing Board. The average size
 of the dairy herds is 50 cows. Several
 of the farms have a flock of{sheep,   
 producing fat lambs for market in     
 autumn. {Pigs} are the only enterprise
 on one farm but they are secondary    
 production on 3 of the other farms.   
 The dairy farms all produce{silage}as 
 winter feed for their herds and 50% of
 the farms grow{corn,}mainly barley for
 home stock consumption. The remaining 
 farm produces {beef} for sale at the  
 local town marts. Calves are both home
 bred and bought in for this purpose.  
 Each of the farms is owned and farmed 
 by the same family with one exception 
 -Colpitts Grange, where a manager has 
 been employed.                        </content>
