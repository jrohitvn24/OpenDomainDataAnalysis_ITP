		<content>   There is a large{green}in the       
 centre of the village.In the past the 
 Mill Leat crossed it but this has now 
 been filled in.There are some swings  
 there.The School,a village hall called
 "The Reading Room" and several        
 cottages all face on to the green.    
 There is also a Post Office,which     
 sells fruit,icecream and postcards,a  
 small grocery shop and a telephone    
 kiosk.                                
                                       
   On the main road is the entrance to 
{Constable Burton Hall}owned by the    
 Wyvill family and on the edge of the  
 village a public house called "The    
 Wyvill Arms".The beck is crossed by   
 a bridge carrying the main road which 
 follows the wall surrounding the Hall 
 grounds.
