		<title>12ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, CLAY HILL</title>
		<content> St. John's the Baptist Church was     
 completed in 1857 in the venetian     
 style, as a Chapel of Ease to St.     
 Andrews, Enfield Parish Church.The    
 church was consecrated and finally    
 became a separate parish in 1867.Later
 a vicarage was built and then chairs  
 removed from the church and benches   
 installed.Gas lighting replaced the   
 original oil lamps and electric light-
 ing was installed in 1949.The altar   
 reredos of terracotta sandtone showing
 the baptism of Christ dates from this 
 time, as does the Hunter Organ.The    
 brass eagle lantern was presented in  
 1896.The carillon peal of 8 bells     
 was installed in 1927 as a memorial to
 those who died in 1914-18 war.The     
 Church has many stained glass windows,
 many dating from the early years and  
 for this reason the Church is now a   
 listed building.                      </content>
