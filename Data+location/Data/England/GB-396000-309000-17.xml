In a recent survey of Sherbrook        
school children concerning the         
employment of their fathers it was     
found that 10% were employed in the    
primary sector as  coal miners, 15%    
were employed in the secondary sector  
as mechanics and builders and 75% were 
employed in tertiary sector, covering  
the full range of service industries.  
 Cannock District Council is anxious   
to help young people to find employment
and have therefore established many    
local schemes which provide valuable   
experience for school leavers.         
 Unfortunately, 22% of the population  
of Cannock are unemployed however, the 
area has a lot to offer the potential  
 mployer(see page 8 ) and Cannock      
Council is encouraging industrial      
growth.
