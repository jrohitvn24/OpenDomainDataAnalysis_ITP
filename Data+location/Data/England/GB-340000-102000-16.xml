		<content> In Broadwindsor school we have a      
 library.It is full of interesting     
 books.We have a colour code to help us
 find the books we are looking for.I am
 a library monitor with Ruth,Nicola and
 Andrew.We are supposed to tidy the    
 library often, but we tidy it rarely. 
 We keep mathematics equipment in      
 there.There is a table in there, so   
 that you can have a quiet read.By the 
 library is the kitchen.It is separated
 from the library by a big brown       
 curtain.People choose reading books   
 from the library. I think that we are 
 very lucky to have a library with so  
 many interesting books.
