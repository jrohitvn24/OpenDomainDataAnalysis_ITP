 In a survey of peoples opinions about 
 Alne we found that everyone was       
 satisfied  with the village but one   
 person said that there should be kerb 
 stones along the sides of the roads   
 and more street lamps on both sides of
 the street.                           
  A lot of the old people  said that   
 the village could'nt be improved.     
 Nearly everyone said  the {bus service
 was very good but one old man was     
 disappointed about the buses being    
 stopped on a Sunday.Some people said  
 there should be a playing field or    
 something for the children to play    
 safely,and some that said there should
 be a mini supermarket.Some people said
 that the village had improved since   
 1940,and think that Alne is one of the
 prettiest {villages in North          
{Yorkshire. }                          </content>
