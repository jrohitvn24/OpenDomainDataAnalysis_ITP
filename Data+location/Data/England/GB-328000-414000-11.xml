		<title>11OLD LADY ON VILOENCE &amp; WAR</title>
		<content> I interviewed a 76 year old war widow 
 who lived in a rest home in Birkdale. 
 She survived the horrors of both world
 wars and has seen many changes in the 
 standards and attitudes of our society
 Despite the high unemployment and     
 rising prices of today she believed   
 that the majority of people complain  
 too much;life when she was young had  
 been much harder due to the 1930's    
 depression.She thought that the       
 Government had got its priorities     
 wrong,that they spent too much time   
 and money on nuclear weapons and not  
 enough on reducing unemployment.She   
 said that a war of nuclear powers     
 could never happen because that would 
 reduce the second world war to a      
 pillow fight.She thought that violence
 had been with us since the 1930's but 
 todays improved communications made   
 everybody more aware of the problem.  </content>
