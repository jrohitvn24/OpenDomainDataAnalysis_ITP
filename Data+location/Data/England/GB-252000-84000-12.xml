		<title>12Birds on the Moor</title>
		<content>    In our travels around the area     
 several birds have been seen.         
    Possibly the most common is the    
{Skylark.}In the summer months its song
 enlivens the atmosphere of the moor.  
 It seems as if one is not alone with  
 the sound of the Skylark shimmering   
 down from a cloudless blue sky.       
    Another common bird seen on the    
 moor is the{Wheatear.}This bird is    
 distictive in that it has a bright    
 white rump. Rumour has it that the    
 bird used to be called "whitearse",   
 but this was changed to Wheatear to   
 suit out choosy Victorian ancestors.  
   {Crows}are common on the moor, but  
 if you are lucky you will see a{raven 
 feeding on the lambs that do not make 
 it. This large black bird is easy to  
 recognise by its size.                
    Finally there is the king of the   
 moorbirds,- the{Buzzard.              </content>
