		<title>12Sparham Agriculture</title>
		<content> Most of the land in Sparham is owned  
 and farmed by one family, who have    
 lived there for several generations.  
 The major part of the land is arable  
 growing a variety of crops including  
 wheat, barley, sugar beet, oil seed   
 rape and rye-grass. Some of the land  
 borders a 3 mile stretch of river     
 which is let. The watermeadows fatten 
 cattle. 200 acres is woodland, farmed 
 with oaks for future generations      
 thereby helping with the dreaded      
 Capital Transfer Tax. The oak is      
 interspersed with other trees which   
 all have an earlier harvest. This     
 woodland provides natural cover for   
 wildlife. There is a disused          
 brick-kiln which was used to provide  
 bricks for all the buildings.
