		<title>08Shopping in South Benfleet.</title>
		<content> A variety of employment is available  
 locally in trade and industries       
 serving local people.There are 17     
 hairdressimg establishments,4 Banks,3 
 firms of Accountants,4 solicitors,3   
 travel agents,4 Building Societies and
 7 firms of Estate Agents.The three    
 super-markets have limited scope,so   
 that many people shop outside this    
 area in Pitsea,Basildon,Hadleigh or   
 Southend. Small general grocers are   
 closing down,but several newsagents   
 are beginning to sell a variety of    
 tinned and packaged food.Local shops  
 cater for gardeners and DIY           
 enthusiasts.This year a very large DIY
 centre,PAYLESS,has opened in Benfleet 
 and may in time affect the small shops
 serving the DIY market.Numerous       
 advertisements in Post Offices and    
 newsagents offer services of          
 individual,decorators,plumbers,etc.   </content>
