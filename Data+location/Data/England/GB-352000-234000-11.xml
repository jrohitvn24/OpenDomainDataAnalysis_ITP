		<title>11HOLME LACY HOUSE 2</title>
		<content> Now the house is empty,in{1985,}and   
 probably{1986.}Five years past from   
 1986,it closed down.If you have read  
{page 10}you would know that it was    
 used as an{old peoples' home.}It      
 closed because of reduction in the    
 health service .They did not have     
 enough money to run it.The old people 
 were moved to Saint{Mary's Hospital}in
 the{city of Hereford.}It is now       
 empty; workmen are re-rendering the   
 sides,it is covered in                
 scaffolding.   People are not allowed 
 inside because of the{asbestos dust}in
 the doors, for stopping fire.This can 
 make walking hard.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
