		<title>20SPECIAL DAYS AT HORNDEAN</title>
		<content> In Horndean, once every year, in the  
 grounds of Cadlington House there is a
 carnival in aid of charity. Every year
 a fair comes and people set up stalls 
 and games. There is a parade and a    
 prize for the best float and walking  
 party. The carnival lasts three days  
 and on the last day there is a horse  
 show. On November 5th there is a fair 
 to celebrate bonfire night. A big     
 bonfire is built and a model of Guy   
 Fawkes placed on top.  On Remembrance 
 Day people of the village gather at   
 the War Memorial on the village square
 to remember those who died in the two 
 Great Wars.                           
 The information covering this Block   
 has been compiled by pupils from Hart 
 Plain, Wecock and Horndean Middle     
 Schools and Cowplain Comprehensive    
 School.
