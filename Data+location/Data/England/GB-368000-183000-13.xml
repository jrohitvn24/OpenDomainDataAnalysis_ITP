		<title>13TRANSPORT IN NORTH YATE</title>
		<content> Most pepole who live in the North     
 Yate area own a medium-sized family   
 car.Some people have two cars.A few   
 people have another vehicle, for      
 example a lorry,and most families have
 some bicycles.Not many people are     
 completely satisfied with the local   
 roads.One complaint is that they are  
 full of pot-holes and repairs are not 
 done quickly enough.Another worry is  
 the large lorries that have to use the
 small roads.Some people would like to 
 see lower speed limits and others     
 would be pleased to see some cycle    
 paths.The public transport in the area
 consists solely of an occasional bus  
 service.Almost every family in the    
 area has their own private car, and   
 not many people have cause to use the 
 buses.There is a disused station and  
 railway line, which quite a few       
 people think should be reopened.      </content>
