 300 years. Parts of the church date   
 from the Norman conquest. The village 
 is of linear development &amp; new        
 building work is mainly filling in    
 extensions or other improvement work. 
 Many roof timbers are prefabricated.  
 Outer walls are generally of brick    
 construction. The inner walls may be  
 brick or block such as celcon. Many   
 houses have wooden frames inside walls

 their homes by double glazing lagging 
 the roof and cavity insulation but
