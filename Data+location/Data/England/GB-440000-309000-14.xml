		<content>   Many sporting opportunities are     
 available in Ibstock.                 
   Most of the indoor ones are to be   
 found at the Community College and    
 they include basket-ball, badminton,  
 judo, swimming and canoeing. These    
 facilities are shared by a very active
 club for the disabled.                
   The Miners' Welfare runs a thriving 
 bowls club and also cricket and       
 football teams. The Welfare cricket   
 ground is situated behind the club    
 building in Leicester Road and the    
 Ibstock Town C.C. ground is just off  
 Melbourne Road.                       
   The Welfare Club has two teams in   
 the local District League and Ibstock 
 Penistone Rovers' F.C. is in the Derby
