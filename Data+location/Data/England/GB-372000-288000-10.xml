		<title>10EARDINGTON MANOR SHROPSHIRE</title>
		<content>{  Eardington Manor}was built in 1790  
 and had 10 acres of ground.It is now a
 GRADE TWO{listed building.            
  The seven of us who visited the house
 and spoke to the owner were amazed by 
 the sheer size of the building.The    
 idea of a private house having 24     
 rooms and a swimming pool was to us   
 staggering.                           
  The house has a large cellar,of      
 several rooms,which floods when the   
 R.Severn rises.Nowadays there is an   
 electrical pump which automatically   
 empties the cellar.                   
  During excavation for the swimming   
 pool over 100 Victorian bottles,jars  
 and a china doll were unearthed.      
  Several years ago an extension was   
 added in the same style as the        
 original building.The house is in good
 condition and provided an interesting 
 visit.                                </content>
