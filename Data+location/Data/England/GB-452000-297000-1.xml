		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content>    In our area there are three        
 residential villages,Narborough,      
 Enderby and Whetstone.There are not   
 many shops in each village but they   
 sell a wide variety of household      
 goods.                                
    Each village is separated by       
 countryside,covering a large part     
 of our area.There are quite a few     
 farms on this undulating land. Two    
 small rivers,the Soar and Sence       
 join North of Enderby bridge.         
    There are quite a few things to    
 do at the leisure centre in Enderby or
 in the village parks.There are several
 pubs in each village.                 
    A  big mental hospital called      
 Carlton Hayes lies between Narborough 
 and Enderby.There is a main police    
 station,well placed for access to     
 the M1 motorway,one of the major roads
 in the country.{                      </content>
