 At one time this area contained the   
 main line to London and Leicester as  
 well as a line from Northampton to    
 Peterborough,known as the Nene Valley 
 Line.This was double_tracked and its  
 route can still be traced in places.At
 Ditchford,for example,the old level   
 crossing gates survived until         
 recently.The trackbed now forms a road
 to the local water treatment works at 
 Broadholme.There was also a branch    
 line to Higham Ferrers,opened in 1894 
 from a junction near Wellingborough.It
 was a single line and was to go on to 
 Raunds,but this was never finished.The
 old station at Rushden,on this branch 
 line,now forms a recently _opened     
 transport history museum.
