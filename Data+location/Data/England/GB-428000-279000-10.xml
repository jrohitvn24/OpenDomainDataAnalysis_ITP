		<content> A 650 house estate is presently (1985)
 under construction in the area between
 Upper Eastern Green Lane and the A45, 
 immediately adjacent to the 'green    
 belt' between Coventry and Birmingham.
 The estate is being constructed by    
 three building firms; Bovis, Bryant   
 and Benfield - the last of these also 
 being responsible for the development 
 of a shopping complex on the site.    
                                       
 The Bovis homes are typical of the    
 houses being built, their part of the 
 new estate being called Woodridge. It 
 is incidentally the 100th aniversary  
 of the foundation of the firm this    
 year.                                 
                                       
 There are 223 houses on the Woodridge 
 estate. There are 10 types of houses  
 varying in price between Â£40 000 and  
 Â£60 000. They are called the Stratford</content>
