		<title>14LIVE-AID CONCERT</title>
		<content> In October 1984 a film report of the  
 starving people of Ethiopia stunned   
 the people of the world. Children and 
 grown-ups were dying in their 1000's  
 because of the famine in their        
 country.People all over the world     
 responded by raising money to help    
 provide food  and shelter to those who
 were suffering.                       
 Bob Geldof,a Pop-Star, decided to     
 raise money by getting singers to sing
 a song. The group was named Band-Aid  
 and the song was "Do they know its    
 christmas?". American Pop stars made a
 similar record. The records were such 
 a big success, raising lots of money, 
 Bob Geldof arranged a World-Wide Pop  
 Concert, with the American Groups.    
 The concert was watched on TV by      
 millions of people and raised Â£50,000 
 000. Bob Geldof was very pleased.
