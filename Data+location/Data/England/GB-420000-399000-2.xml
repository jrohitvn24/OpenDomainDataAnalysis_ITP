		<content> The area rises to over 300 metres.The 
 northern two-thirds of the area is a  
 plateau or gently sloping dip slope,  
 while the southern third is a scarp   
 running steeply down to Stocksbridge, 
 over 100 metres below.                
  Plantations and isolated farmsteads  
 are scattered over the plateau        
 surface,which is dissected by several 
 small becks and cloughs.              
  The man-made Underbank Reservoir in  
 the south-west corner is over 1km.    
 long and provides water for industries
 and recreation.                       
  The eastern boundary of the area is  
 formed by the Little Don river        
 valley,whose steep sides are masked by
 trees.
