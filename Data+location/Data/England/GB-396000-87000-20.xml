		<title>20ARNE'S LIFE,PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content>   In the nineteenth century smuggling 
 was one of Poole's main industries.   
 Leading merchants both profited and   
 disapproved.They petitioned the       
 Government in 1720 and 1722 to halt   
 smuggling.A few years later they asked
 for measures to be relaxed as so many 
 people were in prison!                
   Nowadays apart from the farm owners 
 only one person lives and works on    
 Arne;that is the warden of the Nature 
 Reserve whose bungalow is situated    
 opposite the car park.Tourism is an   
 important aspect of Arne but tourists 
 have to walk nearly 3/4 of a mile to  
 reach the beach from the car park,    
 unless they arrive by boat.
