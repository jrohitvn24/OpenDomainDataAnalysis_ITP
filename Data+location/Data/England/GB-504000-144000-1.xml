		<title>01Albury Heath &amp; Farley Heath</title>
		<content>  The valley of the Lawbrook divides   
 the uplands of Albury Heath and Farley
 Heath.   This is a rural green belt   
 area, west of Guildford, of           
 heathlands, woods, farmland and       
 hamlets.   It is good horse riding and
 walking country, and many horses and  
 ponies are kept.   Most people commute
 to work in London; the Reading/       
 Torbridge railway passes through but  
 does not stop, so people drive to     
 Clardon on the Guildford-Waterloo     
 line.   People are very mobile and    
 houses change hands frequently; small 
 houses are enlarged but few new houses
 have been built.   Mainly in Albury   
 Parish, partly in Shore, the area     
 still has a church and a pub, but     
 Brook shop and the school closed      
 recently and there are few buses to   
 Guildford now.   Most of the farming  
 is market gardens, with a few animals;</content>
