		<content>  The deciduous woodland and disused   
 railway line, being seldom disturbed, 
 provide ideal cover for most common   
 British birds. Yellowhammers and      
 linnets are abundant in the woodland, 
 pigeon, lapwing, larks, and starlings 
 on open ground.Yellow Wagtails as     
 summer visitors  breed successfully.  
 Pheasant and partridge may also be    
 seen.                                 
   The woodland comprises mainly       
 hawthorn ash and oak with blackberry, 
 elderberry, wild rose and sloe bushes.
 Few elm trees have survived Dutch Elm 
 disease.  Many wild flowers are found 
 such as cowslips, primrose, campion,  
 willow herb and bluebells.            
  Most of the common British mammals   
 are found including badgers, foxes,   
 hares, rabbits and hedgehogs. Badger  
 setts and fox earths can be seen in   
 the railway embankment.               </content>
