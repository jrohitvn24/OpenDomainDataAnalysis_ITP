		<title>05Manwood's School,Sandwich</title>
		<content>   Sir Roger Manwood's School is       
situated on the Deal side of Sandwich. 
Despite the school being on the        
outskirts of the town it is easily     
accessible.                            
   Most of the pupils live in Sandwich 
or Deal or in surrounding villages. A  
few live in Dover or Thanet.  Most of  
the problems met are in travelling to  
and from school.                       
   Recently the school has had a new   
building added to create room for more 
pupils on the admission of girls. In   
the building there are new rooms for   
language studies, music, cooking and   
art. The school has good playing       
fields but unfortunatly, because       
Sandwich is in a marshy area the       
fields often become flooded.           
   The school also takes boarders.     
Since the town offers few recreational 
facilities the school provides most.   </content>
