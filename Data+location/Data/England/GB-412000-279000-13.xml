		<title>13Solihull Station</title>
		<content> Solihull Station was first opened in  
 1852 by the Great Western Railway on  
 the line from Snowhill,Birmingham and 
 London Paddington. The original       
 station was closer to Streetsbrook    
 Road than the modern one.             
    There have been many changes over  
 the years. The extra lines that       
 allowed broad and narrow guage trains 
 to run have been removed and the      
 footbridge has been replaced by a     
 subway. The first train to use the    
 station was Lord of the Isles. At one 
 time the station was very important.  
 It had four tracks and was on the     
 lines between Birmingham and Oxford   
 and Banbury and Leamington Spa. Now it
 is not so important. When they were   
 testing new bridges at the station    
 they joined up 4 of the biggest steam 
 trains and raced them down the track. 
 The bridges are still there.          </content>
