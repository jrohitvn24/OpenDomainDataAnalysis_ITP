		<title>12THE BLUECOAT SCHOOL,OLDHAM</title>
		<content> AN OLDHAM HATTER BUILT BLUECOAT AS A  
 BOARDING SCHOOL FOR ORPHAN BOYS IN    
 1834.IT IS NOW A MIXED COMPREHENSIVE  
 SCHOOL BUT IT ONLY TAKES CHURCH OF    
 ENGLAND PUPILS ALTHOUGH,IN THE        
 FUTURE,IT COULD BE OPEN TO            
 ANYONE.1130 PUPILS ATTEND BUT THERE IS
 STILL A WAITING LIST.IT IS POPULAR    
 BECAUSE IT UPHOLDS ITS TRADITIONS BUT 
 KEEPS ABREAST OF MODERN TIMES.A PUPIL"
 IS EXPECTED TO CONDUCT HIMSELF IN SUCH
 A MANNER AS TO BRING CREDIT TO HIMSELF
 AND THE SCHOOL AND TO ALWAYS SEEK THE 
 BEST".THESE OLD MOTTOES STILL         
 APPLY.IT'S A HAPPY SCHOOL WITH EQUAL  
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOYS AND GIRLS AND  
 IT GETS RESULTS.EVEN IN THIS AGE OF   
 UNEMPLOYMENT,MOST OF THE STUDENTS FIND
 WORK OR GO INTO FURTHER               
 EDUCATION.PUPILS BELIEVE THAT A GHOST 
 HAUNTS THE SCHOOL.WE KNOW THAT A MAID 
 COMMITTED SUICIDE THERE MANY YEARS AGO</content>
