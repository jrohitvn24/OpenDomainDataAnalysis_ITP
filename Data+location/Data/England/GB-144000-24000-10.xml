		<title>10Housing in Mousehole</title>
		<content>    {Mousehole}developed as a{fishing} 
 village and it is known to have been  
 in existance, with its name spelt in  
 various ways, since 1284.  The coast  
 shape provided a sheltered cove and   
 the island, although some distance    
 from the shore, a form of breakwater. 
     There is only one house in        
 Mousehole today which was built before
 1595.  The reason for this is that the
 Spaniards attacked Mousehole in that  
 year and all but the 'Keigwin Arms'   
 were burned to the ground.  However   
 the houses that were built after this 
 are huddled together with narrow      
 streets and are made of{granite.}     
{Newer houses}and bungalows that have  
 been built around the outside have    
 used more modern materials, while the 
 net lofts and cellars of the old      
 houses are now let out to {summer     
{visitors.                             </content>
