		<content>   I've been a policeman in Herne for  
 nearly 10 years. I cycle round the    
 area,I'm a community policeman.I'd    
 rather do the job of a constable than 
 take promotion and lose contact with  
 the public.                           
   My working hours are eight hour     
 shifts. My job is to go round calling 
 on people,listening to their problems 
 and trying to sort them out. I deal   
 with people who have had their houses 
 burgled,road traffic accidents and    
 investigate sudden deaths.            
   About 40 policemen cover the Herne  
 Bay and Whitstable area in            
 shifts.I work from 8a.m. until late   
 afternoon,or 4p.m. till 2a.m.         
   Life's a bit more hectic here than  
 at my last posting on Romney Marsh    
 which was just farms cows and sheep.
