		<content>{  Pomery Wood}(924463) is a coniferous
 wood and some of it is a plantation.  
 The wood consists mainly of pine, fur 
 and spruce. There are several tracks  
 on its outer perimeter. Many of the   
 trees have been cut down and as a     
 result this wood is not very dense. It
 covers an area of 275 sq.m.           
  {Golden Wood}(934464) is a broadleav-
 ed wood and has only a few conifers   
 here and there. There are hardly any  
 tracks. The wide variety of trees here
 includes oak, ash, poplar, willow and 
 beech. This wood is far denser than   
 Pomery Wood and covers 379 sq.m.      
  {Carveth Wood}(925457) is also       
 coniferous and is much like Golden    
 Wood. However, it has fewer tree      
 varieties; these include ash, beech   
 and holly. There are no tracks in the 
 wood which is very dense and covers an
 area of about 380 sq.m.               </content>
