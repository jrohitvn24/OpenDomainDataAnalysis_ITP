{  }Torpoint is quite a large town,but 
 we do not think there enough shops for
 a town of this size.We think there are
 not enough shops because it is so near
 to Plymouth.However there is a problem
 of getting to Plymouth,the ferry to   
 get across to Plymouth always has long
 queues.A survey was done of people    
 shopping in Torpoint.                 
{ }Here are the questions they were    
 asked:                                
{ Shoppers questions.
