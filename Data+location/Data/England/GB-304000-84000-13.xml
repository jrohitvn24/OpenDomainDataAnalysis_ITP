		<title>13 TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>The main communication route is the    
A376 which runs N-S along the line of  
the Otter,but on terraces always above 
10 metres.This road by-passes          
E.Budleigh &amp; is a busy commuter &amp;      
coastal access route.Minor roads run   
from this westward up &amp; onto &amp; across  
the commons.The Yettington road bridges
the Otter &amp; runs through Otterton in   
the east.All roads are very busy       
during the holiday period (May-Sept).A 
single-decker Devon General bus runs   
along the A376 at hour intervals en    
route from Exmouth to Sidmouth.The fare
from E.Budleigh to B.Salterton is 60p &amp;
to Exmouth is 100p. This is the only   
public transport in the area now       
the railway has gone.Use of private    
cars is essential for mobility;taxis   
are a more expensive alternative.
