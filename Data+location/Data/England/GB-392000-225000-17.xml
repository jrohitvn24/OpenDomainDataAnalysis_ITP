		<title>17BROCKHAMPTON SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> We visited a Sewage Works or Farm.It  
 is owned by the Severn Trent Water    
 Authority.It serves the Southam/ Wood-
 mancote area.The Works treats domestic
 sewage waste  and industrial waste    
 from Smiths Industry.The Works deals  
 with 1,000,000 gallons of sewage a    
 day,which is taken into the Works by  
 Archimedes Screw.There are 4 but only 
 1 is used on an average day.The sewage
 is cleaned by settlement tanks ,      
 sprayers and biological coke bed      
 filters.Only 2 people work            
 there.Sometimes they have to unblock  
 and mend the Treatment Works. The     
 Works also deals with surface rain    
 water.But in a storm flooding doesn't 
 cause any problems because storm tanks
 hold the extra water. The Authority   
 owns another property in the area,a   
 small sewage treatment works near     
 Stoke Orchard.                        </content>
