		<content>   The Dilhorne Recreation and         
Community Centre is somewhat unusual   
in that it is totally voluntary unaided
Centre run by a small management       
committee of approximately 12,         
established in 1969 by a Scheme of the 
Secrtetary of State for Education &amp;    
Science(under the Charities Act of     
1960).                                 
   It stands in quite a historical     
setting being on the site of the old   
Dilhorne Hall. The original hall was   
demolished in 1350, to be replaced     
twice, the last one in 1837, this was  
demolished in 1927 and all that remains
is the Dilhorne Lodge at the entrance  
to the Centre.This requires finance and
attention to bring it back into use. It
is a Grade 2 listed building. There is 
an ice-house of rare character within  
the grounds, which extends to          
approximately 4.5 acres.               </content>
