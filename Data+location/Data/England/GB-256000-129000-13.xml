		<content> The church and manor of Bishop's      
 Tawton, with its chapelries of Landkey
 and Swimbridge, formed part of the    
 original endowment of the See. At a   
 very early date the Manor of Tawton   
 was given to the Bishops of Devon, and
 a residence was built for them on what
 is now Court Farm. The parish was     
 henceforth to be known as Bishops     
 Tawton. The present owner of Court    
 Farm is Mr. Waldron who is the        
 Chairman of the Governors at Bishop's 
 Tawton Primary School.
