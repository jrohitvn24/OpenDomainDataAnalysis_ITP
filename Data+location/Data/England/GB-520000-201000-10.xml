		<content> Mimms Hall and much of the            
 surrounding area is owned by Lord     
 Salisbury and is part of the estate of
 Hatfield House.  Mimms Hall was built 
 in 1598 and extensions have been      
 built on since then. It is now leased 
 out to private tenants. Interesting   
 features of this building are the     
 priest holes in the fireplace of      
 the games room. Little is known of the
 history of this building but a local  
 historian is carrying out research at 
 the moment.
