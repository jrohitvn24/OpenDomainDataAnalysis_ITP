		<content> A major shopping centre is growing    
 near Rayleigh Weir.The site is close  
 to the junction of the A127 with an   
 estimated population of 300000 in a 30
 minute drive.The units include a major
 food store,furniture and other nation-
 al retailers.Smaller shops also cater 
 for needs such as newspapers.The site 
 has a car park and easy access, alth- 
 ough peak hour congestion has yet to  
 be relieved by a flyover.The effects  
 on local shops has yet to be measured 
 and the increase in population        
 provides some extra people locally.A  
 similar development within a 5 mile   
 radius at Basildon where there is an  
 enclosed centre may attract some of   
 the customers.With a gradual increase 
 in housing demand and a growing need  
 for pm shopping by car such centre    
 will multiply.
