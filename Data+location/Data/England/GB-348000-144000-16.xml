		<title>16Amenities, Wookey-Bleadney</title>
		<content>  A survey was conducted in 1983 to    
 compare the amenities in Somerset     
 villages with those which existed in  
 1966. In the Wookey to Bleadney area  
 there were the following amenities in 
 1966: a Post Office, food shop,       
 primary school and daily bus service  
 in Wookey; in Henton, a Post Office,  
 food shop and village hall plus a     
 daily bus service; and in Worth,      
 Yarley and Bleadney, only a daily bus 
 service.                              
  In 1983 the survey showed that these 
 amenities had been maintained, and in 
 this respect this area has been       
 luckier than villages in many other   
 parts of Somerset. However, there has 
 been a decline in the number of buses 
 which run daily through the area, now 
 only three a day with one extra in the
 morning, which runs only from Wells to
 Wookey.                               </content>
