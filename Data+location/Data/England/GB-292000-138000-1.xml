 Cutcombe is a small village on Exmoor.
 The village has developed in two      
 parts, Cutcombe village itself with   
 the church and Wheddon Cross at the   
 cross-roads.                          
 The houses in the village are a       
 mixture of new and old. Some are made 
 of stone or brick and some are        
 thatched.                             
 There are many good views from the    
 village especially the view towards   
 Dunkery Beacon.                       
 There are farms all round the village 
 and they are mixed farms.             
 The village pub is called The Rest and
 be Thankful. This is an old name and  
 in the past travellers who had come up
 the long steep hills to the village   
 were thankful to be able to have a    
 rest, a drink and some food and even  
 to stay the night.                    </content>
