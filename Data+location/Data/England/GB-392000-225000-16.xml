		<title>16SWINDON VILLAGE TROUGH</title>
		<content> In{Swindon Village }there is a horse  
 trough of polished red marble.Nowadays
 it is used for growing flowers to make
 the Village look pretty. People used  
 to put water in it and the horses used
 to drink out of it.The {Trough}used to
 be situated outside the old Cross     
 Hands Pub,Tewkesbury Road. The old pub
 was pulled down and the new Cross     
 Hands Pub was built,so it was decided 
 to move the{Trough}to outside         
 Swindon Village Hall. They considered 
 it was a better site. The writing on  
 it says,                              
  "Presented by Mrs.Waddington and the 
 Misses Emily and Blanche Belcher in   
 memory of their father and mother     
 Mr.and Mrs. Belcher of Swindon        
 Hall,1909. Metropolitan Drinking      
 Fountain and Cattle Trough            
 Association". We had Belchers at      
 Elmfield Junior School.               </content>
