		<content>   The surgery is a General Practice   
and does not specialise in anything.   
Six partners, a trainee and a part     
time doctor work there. On the ground  
floor there are five rooms plus a      
reception area and a waiting room. On  
the first floor there are three rooms. 
Five receptionists, two nursing sis-   
ters, a secretary, a prescriptionist   
a book keeper and two cleaning ladies  
also work at the surgery.              
   Doctors carry a great deal of equip-
ment such as a stethoscope, needles,   
dressings, etc which they buy themsel- 
ves. In the surgery, scales, peak flow 
meters, scissors, etc are bought by the
partnership. Twelve thousand patients  
are on the surgery's list. Each partner
and trainee do nine surgeries per week 
The part time assistance does three to 
five surgeries a week.
