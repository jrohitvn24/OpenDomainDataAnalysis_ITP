		<content>   The suitable small pieces of clay   
 from the separator were then pressed  
 together into a brick shape and these,
 because of their colour were called   
 green bricks.   After the green       
 bricks were burnt they were called    
 commons.  If they are to be more      
 important facing bricks then they are 
 blasted with coloured dry clay.       
   Then we saw the workmen stacking the
 bricks by hand into a special pattern.
 They do have machines which try to do 
 this but they keep breaking down.     
 After they are stacked, a fork lift   
 truck comes along and takes the stack 
 to one of the many chambers which make
 up the kiln.
