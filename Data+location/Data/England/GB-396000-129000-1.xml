		<content> Upper and Lower Chicksgrove are       
 hamlets in a farming area which, apart
 from the coming of the railway, has   
 remained virtually unchanged for      
 hundreds of years. Each settlement is 
 centred round a farm with which the   
 older buildings were once directly    
 connected. Both adjoin the road which 
 runs at a safe distance from the water
 meadows of the river valley. Only one 
 meadow retains the channels and stone 
 sluices of the flooding system while  
 the weir and sluices on the river are 
 falling into disrepair. Cereals, sheep
 and store cattle are raised but the   
 undulating nature of the land would   
 probably preclude much further        
 enlargement of fields while the narrow
 road inhibits industrialisation. With 
 its stone and thatched buildings and  
 ancient hedges, this area is really   
 like an illustration in child's book. </content>
