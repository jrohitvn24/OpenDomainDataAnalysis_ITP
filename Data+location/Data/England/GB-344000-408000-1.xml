		<content>Lathom is a scattered rural area with  
about 3,500 inhabitants in the civil   
parish. It is bounded by Ormskirk,     
Skelmersdale and Burscough. The R.Tawd 
and the Liverpool-Leeds Canal flow     
through the area. Most of the land is  
undulating and covered by farms. A few 
people work on the land, some travel to
Liverpool or Manchester to work and    
some are unemployed. Pilkingtons       
Research Labs. stands out from the     
scattered farms and cottages. There are
some modern houses but most are old    
dwellings and barns which have been    
modernised. Buildings of note are      
Lathom Park Chapel (1500),Blythe Hall  
(1700),and the west wing of Lathom     
House (1734), now largely derelict.    
Amenities include Ormskirk Golf Club,  
Tawd Vale Scout Camp and Lathom Park   
CofE Primary School which now has 2    
classes and less than 30 on roll.      </content>
