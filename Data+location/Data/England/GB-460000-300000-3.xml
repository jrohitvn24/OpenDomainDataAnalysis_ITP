		<content> We first see this stream as it leaves 
 a drainage ditch near Judgemeadow     
 Secondary School. It then runs south  
 east towards the Leicestershire Golf  
 Course. Part of its course forms the  
 boundary between Evington and the     
 district of Harborough. The stream is 
 small and has a bed made up of sand   
 and gravel. It is also quite shallow. 
 It contains sticklebacks, and many    
 minnows, water shrimps and stone      
 leaches. There are a number of bridges
 over the stream. Golfers use them, but
 also people walking through the Golf  
 Course, as there is a footpath running
 by the side of the stream. Walkers    
 exercise their dogs or are just taking
 fresh air. The stream is an obvious   
 hazard to golfers. At places the bank 
 is boarded, but a number of trees have
 fallen across as the water erodes the 
 soil from the roots.                  </content>
