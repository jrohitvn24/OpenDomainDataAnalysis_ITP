		<title>07Housing in Chitterne</title>
		<content> The majority of the housing stock in  
 Chitterne (south) and area to the     
 south and west is over 5O years old,  
 with the exception of a small estate  
 of seven 4-bedroomed detached houses  
 built in 1975, and five other houses  
 and bungalows. Most of the other      
 houses are mainly cob and slate       
 cottages, though practically every    
 building material is represented in   
 the area. Many of these were farm     
 labourer's cottages but are now almost
 all privately owned. A row of farm    
 cottages along the Shrewton road was  
 demolished in 1963 to allow for road  
 widening, and the residents rehoused  
 mainly in Local Authority houses      
 elsewhere in the village.
