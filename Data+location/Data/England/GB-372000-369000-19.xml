		<title>19Grass Cutting</title>
		<content> Simon.                                
 Alan and I went to Ken's to ask if he 
 wanted the grass cutting.  He said    
 "Yes.  Come in and I'll show you how  
 to use the mower."  When I had nearly 
 finished the brake cable fell off and 
 I went into the hedge.  Luckily Alan  
 switched off the mower.  After        
 receiving 20p each we went home.  In  
 the afternoon we visited Butterfly    
 World in Shropshire where there were  
 thousands of butterflies from all over
 the world.  After fish and chips for  
 tea we went home and I went to bed.
