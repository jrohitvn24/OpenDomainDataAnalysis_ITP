		<title>04ELBURTON PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content>    Elburton{playgroup}was started on  
 March 11th, 1968. It has now been open
 17 years. The teacher says that she   
 opened the playgroup because it was   
 badly needed and was something useful 
 to do.                                
    The playgroup is open five days a  
 week from 9.00 am to 12.00 noon. On   
 Thursdays it is open in the afternoon.
    On average,{30 children}go to the  
 playgroup, all aged 3, 4 or 5.        
    We asked the children in the       
 playgroup some questions:             
 Q) Do you like the playgroup?         
 A) Everyone said yes.                 
 Q) Do you have brothers and sisters?  
 A) Most children said yes.            
 Q) Do you have many friends here?     
 A) All children had 3 or 4 friends.   
 We found that the playgroup was a very
 useful and happy place.
