		<content> Milton Keynes has been built up over  
 the past 10 years and it has one of   
 the biggest shopping centres.Heelands 
 is quite a new estate because it was  
 built about 5 years ago.In Bradwell   
 Village there are a lot of old houses.
 One of them is called The Moat House. 
 Near the pub there are some houses    
 that are quite new but they have been 
 built to look old.Right at the bottom 
 of Bradwell there is a railway that   
 runs from London(Euston) to Glasgow.In
 Kiln Farm and Stacey Bushes there are 
 lots of Warehouses and Factories.     
 Loughton is very nice.It has 4 lakes. 
 It also has some stables with about 20
 horse.Most of the houses there are old
 but they are building a new estate    
 onto it.In the southwest corner of our
 grid there are lots of farms.They are 
 Two Mile Ash farm,Whitehouse farm and 
 Common farm.                          </content>
