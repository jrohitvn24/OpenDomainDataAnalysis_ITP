		<title>09STRADISHALL AND DENSTON</title>
		<content>Stradishall has a number of restored   
thatched houses including several of   
large size.   Home Farm has a central  
chimney with four tall shafts.  Large  
orchards belonging to Justin Brookes   
surround the village, and there is a   
packing station and cool store for     
apples etc.   The small Church of      
St Margaret has an old screen, some    
Tudor seating and an 18th cent pulpit. 
Part of the next village of DENSTON is 
within the area: in particular         
Denston Hall and Park.  The large Hall 
is of many periods, but largely        
Georgian.  It is moated.  The owners   
were among the first to buy motor cars 
and local resident Alfred Hicks was    
under-chauffeur in the 1920s.
