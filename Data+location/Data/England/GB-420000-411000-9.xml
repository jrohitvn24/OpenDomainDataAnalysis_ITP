		<title>09A VISIT TO EMLEY MOOR MAST</title>
		<content> We visited the mast where Mr, Parker  
 met us. Some went into the control    
 room while I went up the mast. I      
 felt frightened waiting to go up. The 
 lift was slow and noisy taking seven  
 minutes to reach the top where I felt 
 scared and shakey but excited.        
 Suddenly I saw something in the sky.  
 Too big for an aeroplane, it was an   
 airship flying over Barnsley. The     
 scenery was amazing, fields were      
 centimetre sized, cars like pinheads  
 and houses like tiny rocks. I didnt   
 feel the swaying of the mast. During  
 this time Mr, Askey was showing the   
 rest the huge disc drives, computers  
 and typewriters which are much bigger 
 than at school. They were excited     
 when they went in the dark room where 
 they saw the world of television on   
 five different screens. It was an     
 interesting and enjoyoble visit.      </content>
