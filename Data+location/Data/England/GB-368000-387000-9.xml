		<title>09May Queen Festival</title>
		<content> The Lymm May Queen Festival orignated 
 in 1889 when the Lymm and Oughtrington
 Band of Hope held their first festival
 in the village.The actual purpose of  
 the festival is veiled in the passage 
 of time but is more likely akin to the
 walking-days of Lancashire with a     
 subsequent field-day for the children 
 of the Band of Hope and Churches.The  
 festival lapsed in 1935 and was       
 revived by a group of enthusiasts in  
 1947 and has been held every year     
 since then.The queens were originally 
 chosen from the chapels,in rotation   
 and the present method follows the    
 pattern except that the four wards are
 now used.Monies raised on the route of
 the procession are given to local     
 charities while the money raised on   
 the field helps to offset the cost of 
 staging the festival.
