		<title>10THE FORD</title>
		<content> Fords were made for carts and people  
 to go through in olden days as there  
 were few bridges.The ford had to be   
 shallow,but its' depth does vary      
 depending on the time of year.        
 The ford on our survey was beside     
 Clappers Farm between {BRAMLEY and    
{SILCHESTER},so the river could be     
 polluted by slurry from the farm,as   
 well as by sticks,stones and other    
 things people may have thrown in.     
 The footbridge across the ford is     
 quite high up,so perhaps the water    
 rises quite a lot sometimes.The water 
 in this ford is fast flowing.         
 The ford is surrounded by North       
 Copse,Clappers Farm,and the           
 Basingstoke to Reading railway line.  
 There are a lot of roads and footpaths
 leading to and from the ford probably 
 because people had to come from all   
 directions to cross the river here.   </content>
