		<content> AGRICULTURAL WORKERS are employed on  
 the                                   
 farms:ploughing,planting,harvesting,  
 milking the dairy herd,rearing cattle 
 and mending fences.The increase in the
 use of FARM MACHINERY however has     
 meant fewer agricultural workers.In   
 the village of Partridge Green most   
 people use their own or firms         
 transport to travel to either HORSHAM 
 or CRAWLEY,notably GATWICK AIRPORT,to 
 work.Some of the WOMEN work in one or 
 other of the industrial estate        
 factories.Village TRAFFIC increases   
 between 8 and 8.30 in the morning and 
 5 and 6.00 in the evening."FLEXI-TIME"
 helps to relieve traffic jams.People  
 may start work at any time between 8  
 and 9.30am.and finish at any time     
 between 4 and 6.00pm.providing that a 
 basic 35/37 hour week is worked.
