		<content>   {Cobtree Manor Park}was once a      
 private zoo and has recently been made
 into a place to walk, play, picnic or 
 anything you like except picking the  
 flowers and damaging the trees. It    
 also has a{golf course}and this is    
 very popular but most people come here
 to{walk}and enjoy being in the        
 country. We often bring a picnic to   
 eat after we have had our walk. There 
 are many walks through both{woods}and 
{open countryside.}The park has a large
{car-park}well screened by trees. It   
 also has a{warden's office}and a      
{toilet block.}Everything else in the  
 park is natural. Many people ride     
 their horses in the park on a         
 specially prepared track. My brother  
 and I often play a chase game with my 
 sisters here - it's good fun.
