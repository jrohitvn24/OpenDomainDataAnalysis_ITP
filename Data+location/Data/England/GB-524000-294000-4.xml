		<title>04New Whittlesey houses</title>
		<content>  Most of the houses in Whittlesey have
 been built in the last forty years.   
  One of the biggest estates is the one
 I live on. The houses are all less    
 than fourteen years old.              
  Our house is on this estate it is a  
 typical new Whittlesey house.         
  It is in the modern style with large 
 windows and glass doors.  The bricks  
 are Fletton Reds and the roof is      
 covered with Purple, Marley tiles.    
  It has three bedrooms, (average size 
 4m by 2.75m), and a bathroom upstairs.
  A hall, lounge,( 5m by 4.5m), dinning
 -room and fitted kitchen downstairs.  
  Outside we have a small front garden 
 and a larger back garden, most of the 
 garden is lawn or flower border. A    
 garage for our car is joined by a car 
 port to the house. Four of us live    
 there.
