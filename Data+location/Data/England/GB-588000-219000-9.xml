 Dutch,French and German lorry drivers.
 In the summer a lot of Dutch and      
 Swedish cyclists stop as well as      
 coaches of foreign school children on 
 trips.The cafe has been in existence  
 for more than 20 years. It closes at  
 7:00 p.m. and they have finished      
 cleaning by 7:30 p.m.She has two full 
 time staff and three part time staff  
 who all arrive by bicycles and have   
 been working there for 20 years.      
 During the course of a day,150_200    
 lorry drivers will have called. The   
 owner eventually goes to bed somewhere
 between 9 and 10 o,clock.She does not 
 serve on Sundays.She has a little girl
 who is looked after by a lady who     
 comes in at 7:00 in the morning.The   
 cafe was broken into in 1983.
