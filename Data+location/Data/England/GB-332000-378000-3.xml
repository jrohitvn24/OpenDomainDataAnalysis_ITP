		<title>03LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content>  For our section we are doing Law and 
 Order.We will be doing about the Home-
 watch Scheme,The Police,The police    
 band and a Civic Award Scheme that we 
 are doing with the school.            
  There are many roads involved in the 
{ Homewatch Scheme}in our area.It      
 involves keeping an eye on other      
 houses in your street and watching for
 suspicious people.                    
  We spoke to Mrs Thompson the         
 homewatch leader for the Edgewood     
 Estate.She told us the police visit   
 the leaders regularly to check that   
 everything is alright.                
  We went out to find out how many     
 people have burglar alarms we asked 27
 people out of these only 3 people had 
 alarms and these had all been fitted  
 recently, but we also found that alot 
 of people also use dogs to guard their
 houses.                               </content>
