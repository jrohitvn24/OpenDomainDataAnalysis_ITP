		<title>01MANSELL LACY SOUTHWARD</title>
		<content> Mansell Lacy lies on the edge of a    
 gently valley N.W. of Hereford with   
 fertile fields and pasture draining in
 the Yazor Brook. The highest ground is
 forested with predominantly coniferous
 pines interspread with clumps of      
 hardwoods such as oak, beech and ash. 
 The steeper fields running down from  
 the woods are generally pasture soon  
 giving way to arable crops such as    
 cereals, potatoes, sugar beet and oil 
 seed rape.  The grass fields support  
 mostly sheep and beef cattle with a   
 little dairy farming with both hay and
 silage being made for winter feeding. 
 A yeoman farming area supporting and  
 employing craftsmen in modern farming 
 and forestry it retains many features 
 of the Landed Estate with keepered    
 shoots, reared pheasants and abundant 
 wild life. The area is rich in flora  
 and faune especially birds and deer.  </content>
