		<content> Miss Stainer originally had a school  
 in London.She was very interested in  
 dancing because she was a friend of   
 Ninette de Valois.She started the     
 school in Sunningdale,on its present  
 site,during World War 2 which supplied
 dancing lessons instead of the usual  
 physical education.She supervised the 
 dancing herself but appointed an      
 academic teacher to be in charge of   
 the other lessons.There were          
 originally 15 pupils but the numbers  
 went up to 174 in 15 years,ranging in 
 age from 4 to 17 years.               
 The school building used to be a      
 private house in its own grounds.Extra
 rooms have been added,including a     
 dance studio and another house called 
 Little Hurst.Recently extra porta     
 cabins have been put up.              
 The school has a kindergarten,Junior  
 Department and a Secondary section.   </content>
