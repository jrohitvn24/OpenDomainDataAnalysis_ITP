		<title>04Traffic Survey</title>
		<content> We went to survey Newton Road and     
Cross Street to count the traffic      
passing through.The vehicles that we   
counted were commercial vehicles,buses,
private cars,motor-cycles bicycles and 
others.The Eastern by-pass will relieve
the traffic from Newton Road and the   
Western by-pass will relieve the       
traffic from Cross Street.From the     
survey we found out that Newton Road   
had more traffic passing through than  
Cross Street.Most people think that the
Western by-pass should be built before 
the Eastern by-pass,because Cross      
Street gets VERY congested in heavy    
traffic, more than Newton Road as Cross
Street is very narrow.                 
 We also agree that the Western by-pass
should be built first.
