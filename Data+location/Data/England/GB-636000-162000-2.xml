		<title>02RESIDENTS OF RAMSGATE</title>
		<content>The population of Ramsgate is about    
40,000,a number which has increased    
slowly over many years.A survey at our 
school revealed that 77% of the        
families had moved here within the past
10 years, most of them coming from     
London &amp; the south-east.Most have come 
here to work.The locally born          
population remains fairly static,but   
other types of people have moved into  
the area.The London boroughs buy houses
in the town &amp; turn them into hostels   
for residents who are aged or mentally 
handicapped.This places a great strain 
on local health services.The centre of 
the town is mainly commercial;the next 
band of properties are owner occupied, 
&amp; the main council estates are towards 
the edge of town.Many local people     
have Welsh or North-East backgrounds   
because miners moved here to work at   
the local coalmines 60 years ago.      </content>
