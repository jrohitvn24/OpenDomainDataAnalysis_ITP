		<content> The church at Shadforth is Anglican.  
 It was built round about 1870.        
 Shadforth church is quite small.There 
 is a Salvation Army church at sherburn
 Hill.It is very big.It has a big hall 
 and a small hall.Quite a few children 
 go.This Salvation Army church has not 
 been up very long.There used to be two
 chapels in square two.One was a       
 Methodist chapel.There was a chapel at
 the east end of Sherburn Village.     
 Worship in the area ha declined in the
 last 20 years, together with a general
 decline in the population. There is   
 now no active place of worship in     
 Ludworth ( although those that once   
 were used are outside of the D block).
