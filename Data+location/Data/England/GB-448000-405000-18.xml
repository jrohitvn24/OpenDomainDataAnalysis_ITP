		<content> The best way of spreading{news}around 
 the villages is by putting a poster in
 the village shops.There are also      
 notice boards at the churches and one 
 at school.Every month the parish      
 newsletter is issued.All the{news     
 about the parishes is in it.At school 
 we used to run a newspaper called The 
 Brodsworth Bugle.It contained{news    
 about school and the village and had a
 puzzle page.All the articles were     
 written by the children. Apart from   
 the National Newspapers the villagers 
 get The Yorkshire Post,The Doncaster  
 Star and The Free Press.The Advertiser
 and Metro{News,}which is the local    
 council paper,are free.The property   
 guide is also free.The local{radio    
 stations are{Radio}Sheffield,{Radio   
 Hallam and Viking{Radio.}The channels 
 we get on{television}are BBC1,BBC2,   
 Yorkshire{Television}and channel 4.   </content>
