		<content> The 'Historic' Hardwick Hall six-mile 
 road race is organised by local runner
 Cyril Leason. It has taken place      
 annually since 1981. The first race   
 was won by Bob Foster of Milton Keynes
 A.C. in 34m 54s. It has been won each 
 year since then by Nick Lees of Derby 
 &amp; County A.C. and his current record  
 time, set on 18th July 1985, stands at
 31m 21s. The Ladies' record was set on
 the same date by Kay Barringham of    
 Hallamshire Harriers H.A.C. with a    
 time of 37m 4s. Both record holders   
 are national runners. Former Great    
 Britain international Keith Angus of  
 Sheffield A.C. holds the Veteran Men's
 (over 40) section record with a time  
 of 33m 28s also set in 1985.          
 The course goes from Pilsley School to
 Hardwick Hall and back. 123 athletes  
 took part in the 1985 race.
