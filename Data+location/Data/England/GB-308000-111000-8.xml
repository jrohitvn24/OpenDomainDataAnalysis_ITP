		<title>08Culmstock after World War 1</title>
		<content>                 by Mr. and Mrs.Channon
       Life in Culmstock just after the
 lst World War was different from life 
 today in many ways. People mainly     
 travelled by horse and trap and       
 outside the Ilminster Stage a         
 wagonette stopped to take passengers  
 to Wellington,4 miles away,and back.  
 The first cars in the village belonged
 to Mr. Knowlman and Mr. Collier and   
 there was a motorised van that used to
 come around selling Brook Bond        
 tea.People didn't leave the village   
 much as there were four general shops,
 two cobblers,three butchers and a     
 blacksmith in the village.            
       House work was far harder and   
 took much longer in those days.Cutlery
 would be cleaned with water and a     
 brick while washing the clothes would 
 take all day as they first had to be  
 boiled in a copper.                   </content>
