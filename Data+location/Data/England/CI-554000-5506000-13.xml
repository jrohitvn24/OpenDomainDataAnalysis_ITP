		<title>13Education in Alderney II</title>
		<content> The childen who go to Guernsey are    
 educated at either the States         
 Grammar School or at one of the       
 Public Schools there.The majority     
 stay on Alderney though to continue   
 their education.At the age of 15      
 children may leave school or they can 
 stay on for C.S.E and O level exams.If
 they wish to continue their education 
 they must leave the island.           
 In recent years the Brecque School was
 the only alternative on Alderney to   
 the States school.It closed in 1971   
 through lack of support.It now        
 operates a pre-school group and also  
 helps children after school hours.    
  There is also a pre-school group     
 run by volunteers that operates in the
 Island Hall.
