		<content>   There are over 500 pupils in our    
 school which is a large one storey    
 building. Its grounds are about 14    
 acres. The school is divided into     
 three year groups and we start at 10  
 and leave at 13. We have maths and    
 English most days and other lessons   
 once or twice a week. We have a       
 library, craft area, cooking area,    
 science lab., large hall and small    
 hall. Dinners, costing 50p each, are  
 cooked in the school but you can bring
 sandwiches. Our uniform is grey skirts
 for girls and grey or black trousers  
 for boys. Both sexes have a shirt,    
 grey jumper and maroon tie. The       
 uniform would cost about Â£40.         
   Some people walk to school but most 
 people come by bus. The bus fare is   
 between 15p and 30p one way.          
   I think it is a good school and very
 educational.                          </content>
