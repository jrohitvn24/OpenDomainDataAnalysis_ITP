		<content> My Dad and I were looking, just after 
 lunch at Bem Bom Brothers Funfair, at 
 a huge Roller Coaster, spinning,      
 whirling and and looping around. Just 
 looking at it made me feel sick. It   
 was blue and white with black         
 carriages, somehow my Dad dragged me  
 into the queue and soon I felt myself 
 settling into the carriage. There was 
 no going back now, my heart was       
 beating extremly fast, slowly we      
 ascended the giant iron monster, at   
 the very top were three red flags, for
 me they spelt out the three minutes of
 sheer agony, and then we dropped, for 
 one second I felt completely          
 weightless, quickly followed by my    
 stomach shooting backwards then a     
 loop, it felt like I was pressed      
 back in my seat, then at last, along  
 quiet silence, we had stopped, and    
 somehow I was standing up, relieved.  </content>
