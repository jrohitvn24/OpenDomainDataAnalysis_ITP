		<content> These are Ipswich and Gorleston.There 
 are no diseases common to this area   
 and the main cause of death is old    
 age.                                  
                                       
{DENTISTRY.                            
   In this area there are two full_time
 dentists,and one half_time.There is no
 major tooth disease other than common 
 decay,in Southwold and Reydon.As in   
 most places, fifty-four percent of the
 population visit their dentist        
 annually.                             
                                       
   Free eye_treatment and cheap spec_  
 tacles are available.The{NHS}is a     
 matter of controversy.It costs a great
 deal and there are many inequalities  
 within it.The Conservative government 
 are working on quite radical reforms  
 and it may not continue as it is,for  
 much longer.                          </content>
