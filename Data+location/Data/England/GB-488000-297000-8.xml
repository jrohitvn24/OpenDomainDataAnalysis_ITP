		<title>08Oldest Woman in Bisbrooke</title>
		<content> (Interview by Colan Bartram and Mark  
 Ferguson)                             
    Mrs Webster is the oldest woman in 
 Bisbrooke - she is 83. She came to the
 village in 1946 and before that lived 
 in Uppingham for 18 months. Her home  
 is Glasgow, and she goes back there   
 for holidays.                         
    Mrs Webster has a small cottage    
 with a living room, a kitchen and two 
 bedrooms. She lives alone and her     
 nearest relative is her aunt of 93 in 
 Uppingham. She watches comedy, soap   
 operas and old westerns on T.V. She   
 gets the news from radio and T.V. and 
 does not take a newspaper. She thinks 
 Bisbrooke is a lovely village because 
 it is so peaceful. She used to work in
 a shop and sold flowers.
