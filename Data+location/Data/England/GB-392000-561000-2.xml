 In 681, Hexham was known as           
{Hagustaldes-ea,}the Water near the    
 home of the Younger Son who had not   
 inherited any of the family land.The  
 Normans changed the Saxon name to     
{Hexham,}the town on the Hextol river, 
 which is now called Cockshawburn.In   
 674,{Queen Ethelreda}gave some land   
 in Hexham to{Wilfrid}to build a       
 church. He built the first church     
 where the Abbey is today, and the     
 Saxon crypt is still there.This became
 a monastery and was granted  sanctuary
 one mile from every direction.Land    
 to the south was the property of the  
 Royal family of Northumbria,and       
 became known as{Hexhamshire,}a lovely 
 area of rolling farmland, villages and
 woods.Hexham grew around the Abbey,   
 and has had an interesting and, at    
 times,a troubled history.             </content>
