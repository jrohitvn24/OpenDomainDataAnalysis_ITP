		<title>17Greenhill Lodge Farm (cont)</title>
		<content>    The fields of the farm had all been
 sown with grass and were intensivly   
 managed.Apart from sheep and cows, Mr.
 Bower kept a few hens to provide eggs 
 for the use of his family.He had no   
 pigs.                                 
   The farm which was yellow brick was 
 probably built in the 1830's or       
 1840's.Its roof was made of{Rosemary  
{tiles}and the windows were sash       
 windows.The cowsheds and other        
 outbuildings were built round an      
 enclosed paved yard.An interesting    
 feature was a dove cote with nine     
 pigeon holes set high in the roof of  
 one of the buildings.When Mr.Bower    
 first took over the farm there were   
 over one hundred nesting boxes there. 
 Pigeon pie used to be very popular    
 with the previous farmers there,who   
 fed the pigeons to provide extra meat.
 Only six now remain.                  </content>
