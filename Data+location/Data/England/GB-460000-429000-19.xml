		<content> The letter{BMX}stand for{Bicycle Moto 
{Cross.}The first{BMX}bikes were built 
 in{1969.}They were built by a group of
 boys addicted to street racing on     
 choppers. When their bikes fell apart 
 they borrowed some welding gear and   
 built their own bikes. Then in no time
 at all{BMX}tracks were built all over 
 the world. Now things have changed    
 slightly and you can buy bikes        
 straight from the shops. There are two
 kinds of{BMX}riding -{Freestyle}which 
 is stunts and{racing.}A{BMX course}   
 normally consists of a {start hill}   
 that can take up to eight racers at a 
 time, two pairs of{whoops,}around five
{berms}which are banked corners and two
{step-ups.}A{step-up}is a jump that    
 goes up the back and a pyramid that   
 goes up 50 degrees each side.
