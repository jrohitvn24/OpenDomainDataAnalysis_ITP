		<content> Netherbury Charities are administered 
 by a committee of local people drawn  
 from Netherbury, Salway Ash and       
 Melplash.  The available yearly income
 is divided among 4 main funds:        
 Smith's Educational Fund: most of     
 which is allocated to Salway Ash      
 Primary School, contributions going to
 Netherbury Play Groups.  Distribution 
 Fund: covers donations to local       
 organisations and voluntary societies 
 according to their need, village hall,
 churchyard, playing field.  Coal Club 
 Fund: provides Christmas coal to the  
 aged, infirm or any in special need.  
 Clothing Fund: allocates money equally
 to each child from the parish leaving 
 Salway Ash to go on to Beaminster,    
 helping with the necessary uniform.   
 The first recorded account of an award
 from a donor is Smith in 1567,        
 followed by Lake and many others.     </content>
