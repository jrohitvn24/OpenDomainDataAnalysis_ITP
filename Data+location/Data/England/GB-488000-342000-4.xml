		<title>04A RESIDENT OF MARSTON</title>
		<content> Though born in Yorkshire Mrs. Slater  
 has lived in Marston for many years.  
 She first came to the village as a    
 land girl during the second world war 
 and stayed.                           
 At her wedding the reception was held 
 in one of the school classrooms as    
 there was no village hall at the time.
 Her husband has worked on a local farm
 for over 50 years.                    
 Mrs. Slater has been school caretaker 
 for 34 years and has served under many
 different head masters.               
 Both Mr. and Mrs. Slater retire this  
 year and will visit their son and his 
 family who have emigrated to          
 Australia.
