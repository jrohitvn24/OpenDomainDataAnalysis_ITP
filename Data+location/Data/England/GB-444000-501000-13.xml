		<content> There are 25 farms ranging from 20 to 
 300 acres. Five have{dairy}stock, one 
 a{sheep}suckler herd, one breeds      
{horses,}the rest mainly arable. Four  
 are tenanted and the others privately 
 owned. Deep fertile boulder clay      
 covers the{land base.}Almost all the  
 area is artificially drained. Fields  
 are 25 acres or less. Principal crops 
 are wheat, barley and oil-seed rape,  
 with a few potatoes and oats. Dairy   
 cattle are Friesian. There is one     
 suckler herd of Angus X. Sheep breeds 
 are Swaledales on a farm with common  
 grazing on the moor, Mashams and Mules
 at other farms. Four farms have grain 
 driers and all grain had to be dried  
 this year when harvest was late and   
 planting still unfinished in          
 mid-October.{Beehive}space is rented  
 in fields of rape and on a site near  
 the heather in summer.                </content>
