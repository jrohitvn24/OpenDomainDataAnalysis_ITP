		<content> They cross to the mainland by boat for
 shopping,school and                   
 entertainment.Those who do not have   
 their own boats use the Castle or     
 National Trust boats.They find Poole  
 and Bournemouth ideal for shopping    
 and when they go out for the day they 
 might go somewhere like Salisbury.    
 For entertainment on the island there 
 is a bar at the castle,croquet,and    
 badminton.Most people have a T.V.They 
 do not find it lonely in the          
 winter,as they enjoy the peace.The    
 houses are Victorian with old pictures
 and antique furniture and the         
 inhabitants have their own private    
 beach.                                
 The weather varies a good deal, but it
 is mainly hot  in the summer and can  
 be rough in the winter.The sea has    
 never frozen over, but there have been
 blocks of ice in it.                  </content>
