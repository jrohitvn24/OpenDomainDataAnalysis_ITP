		<title>01GAZETTEER - HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content>  Located approximately 2 miles        
north-east of Cannock town centre,     
{Hednesford, Rawnsley and Hazelslade}  
lie on the fringes of{Cannock Chase.}  
A Forestry Commission conifer          
plantation covers nearly half of       
the area in the north and east. In the 
south-western corner is the main       
Hednesford connurbation, built         
around Market Street, the local        
commercial centre. An area of          
heathland, known as Hednesford Hills   
divides this old urban district from   
recent council and private housing     
estates at Rawnsley and Hazelslade.    
The population is served educationally 
by 4 schools and ecclesiastically by   
11 religious establishments. A well    
developed road network links the area  
to Rugeley and Stafford in the north,  
and to Cannock and the M6 motorway in  
the south.                             </content>
