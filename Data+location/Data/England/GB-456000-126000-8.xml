		<content> In the morning dad comes in to wake me
 up at 7.15,then I get up,brush my hair
 and then get dressed by about 7.30 and
 I go down to breakfast.For breakfast I
 usually have toast,except when I feel 
 really hungry then I have cereal.I    
 have finished breakfast by 8 o'clock. 
             After I have cleared up   
 the breakfast things I go upstairs    
 clean my teeth,then I play the        
 recorder until about 8.15 when I go   
 upstairs and mess around with my hair 
 and put in my slides.                 
             At 8.30 I go down and open
 the garage for Mum then do a bit of   
 piano and watch breakfast television  
 if there is anything interesting on.  
 I watch until about 8.40 then I get   
 my coat and bag and go to school.I    
 get there about 8.50 if i go slowly.
