		<content>      Elderly residents remember many  
 more{shops}making them almost self-   
 sufficient. Some went to Norwich only 
 twice a year to buy winter and summer 
 clothes. They went by{horse &amp; cart    
 which crossed through the river as    
 there was only a footbridge until the 
 1920s. The{school}had at least 60     
 pupils and 3 teachers financed by the 
{Le Neve}trust and the villagers. The  
 schoolmaster charged 4d. per week.    
      The{church}tower dates from the  
 13th century, the stained glass from  
 the 14th and 15th centuries and the   
 hammer beam roof from the 15th. The Le
 Neve arms appear on some memorials. In
 1970 it was in danger of closing, but 
 local people made concerted efforts to
 restore it and since then it is looked
 after and regular services held. The  
 Rev. Hewetson is vicar for this parish
 as well as for Taverham.{(Mrs J. Sims)</content>
