		<title>20Ribchester in 1953</title>
		<content>On Coronation Day in Ribchester people 
celebrated on the Rec. At night people 
dressed up and went in a torch light   
parade. At the end of Coronation Day   
everybody got a mug.On the Rec there   
was a band,racing and stalls etc. In   
1953 both cotton mills were working.   
All the houses were the same apart     
from Chesterbrook. There was no clinic 
or playgroup. There was no carpark by  
the Recreation ground. There were few  
cars at that time. On November 5th     
they would have bonfires on the river  
bank but they had to stop because of   
the fire risk.                         
The tennis court on the Rec. used to   
be allotments but now these are near   
the river. The river has changed course
during 1953-1985. And the sewage works 
used to be where the allotments are    
now.
