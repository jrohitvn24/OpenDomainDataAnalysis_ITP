		<title>07Chapman's by Jason H</title>
		<content>   My house is about 100 years old.    
 It was built in 1890 and was lived in 
 by a family until 1910 when the       
 Chapman family moved in.A few months  
 later they turned it into a butcher's 
 shop.Their meat was pretty good and   
 they made quite a success of their    
 business although it was not the only 
 butcher's shop in Halling They        
 called it Chapman's.A few years later 
 Chapman's closed down.                
                                       
   Then a family bought the shop and   
 turned it into a house.Our house has a
 cellar.It also has a little room built
 into the right hand side wall.Just    
 before you go into it,you look up     
 towards the ceiling.Hanging on a rusty
 metal bar there are two rusty old meat
 hooks which the Chapmans used to use  
 when it was a butchers shop.
