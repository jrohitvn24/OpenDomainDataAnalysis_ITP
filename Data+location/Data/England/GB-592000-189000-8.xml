		<title>08ALL SAINTS CHURCH BARLING</title>
		<content>  Barling Church is 800_900 years old. 
 It has a square stone tower with  a   
 wooden spire.Rev.Woolven's favourite  
 parts of the  Church are the stained  
 glass windows.He told us that there   
 was a gravedigger who had to open a   
 vault to bury another body and he     
 found a body which was in perfect     
 condition after a 100 or so years.He  
 ran in to tell his wife but when they 
 got back the body had disintegrated.In
 the churchyard the oldest gravestone  
 was dated 1674 it has a skull and     
 crossbones at one end and at the other
 end there is a sand clock.We believe  
 this was to remind us that everyone's 
 life ends at sometime.There are 3     
 bells but they no longer swing, they  
 are rung by ropes attached to the     
 clappers. They are dated 1902. The    
 church has a 15th century font and    
 a 17th century pulpit.                </content>
