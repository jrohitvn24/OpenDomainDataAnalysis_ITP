		<title>06Kimblesworth Colliery</title>
		<content>      Kimblesworth is now without its  
 colliery. Once the village was        
 entirely centred around 'the Pit'. All
 the houses were colliery houses. Now  
 few 'pitmen' reside in the village and
 they work in the coastal collieries.  
      One retired miner who worked for 
 24 years in the mine recalls pushing  
 coal trolleys along tunnels only 75cm 
 high.                                 
      Electricity which is now taken   
 for granted was provided by colliery  
 generator for the village but was not 
 available during the night.           
      The site of the colliery has     
 changed - gone are the winding gear,  
 the railway and the bridge which used 
 to carry it over the A1. In the pit   
 yard small businesses have been set   
 up, such as a small steel             
 manufacturing company and 2 vehicle   
 repair shops.                         </content>
