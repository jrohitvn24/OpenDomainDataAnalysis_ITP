		<title>18  A NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Local residents formed the Friends of 
 Hollywood in June 1981 in response to 
 a threat that woodland was to be      
 redeveloped for housing. Having       
 successfully defeated the proposal    
 they determined to conserve the wood's
 natural character for people and the  
 indigenous wildlife. It is situated on
 either side of the M6 motorway flyover
 between Junctions 6 and 7. Foxes,     
 squirrels and hedgehogs are often     
 spotted amongst the birch, oak and    
 sycamore. In spring bluebells carpet  
 the area, followed by rhododendron in 
 late May and June. Apart from the more
 common birds, residents often hear    
 jays, warblers and great spotted      
 woodpeckers. Local people manage the  
 wood with advice from the Urban       
 Wildlife Group and Sandwell           
 Metropolitan Borough Council.
