		<title>03OLD BUILDING METHOD DUNSFORD</title>
		<content> Dunsford is a small village on the    
 River Teign.It was there in the Norman
 times.It probabally started off as a  
 place where people could cross the    
 river.Dunsford has many old houses    
 which ars built of cob and thatch.Cob 
 is a mixture of straw,small stones,mud
 and dung tightly compacted.The walls  
 are cut with a tool that has a cutting
 edge at right angles to the handle,   
 called an adze.To thatch a roof is a  
 very long job that requires much skill
 on the thatcher's part.Each thatcher  
 has his own way of finishing the ridge
 to show that he has thatched that roof
 We count old houses as over 100 years 
 old but some are six or seven         
 centuries old.
