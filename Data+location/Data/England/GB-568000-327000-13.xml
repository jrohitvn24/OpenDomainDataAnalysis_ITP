		<title>13West Newton Village</title>
		<content> This small village stands on the      
 southern edge of Sandringham Park. It 
 has grown steadily since the          
 acquisition of the Sandringham Estate 
 by The Royal Family. Some 150 people  
 live in cottages, bungalows and a few 
 houses made from local carstone ( a   
 ginger-coloured sandstone) dressed    
 with red brick.                       
                                       
 Most of those who live here either    
 work on or have worked on the estate, 
 but there are a number of retired     
 people who have come from other Royal 
 Houses.                               
                                       
 It is a friendly place, with a church,
 (St. Peter's) a school, a Post        
 Office/ General stores and a club with
 its own bar.
