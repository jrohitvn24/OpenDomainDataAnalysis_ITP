		<title>14THE PEACE MOVEMENT IN LEWES</title>
		<content>      The{Peace Movement}is an         
 important part of the lives of many   
 people in Lewes, expressing their     
 concern for the future of the world.  
      Lewes{Campaign for Nuclear Disar-
{mament}has attracted 550 members since
 its l98l formation. With Youth CND, it
 has members of all ages, from all main
 opposition parties. They have held    
 many demonstrations and vigils, and   
 their street ballots show that many   
 people think about disarmament even if
 they do not believe in unilateralism. 
     {"Lewes Against Trident"}is       
 opposed specifically to Britain's     
 expensive nuclear missile.            
     {Lewes World Disarmament Campaign 
 is a multilateralist peace group.     
      The{Lewes Peace Library}in the   
 Friends Meeting House, has books,     
 posters, games and teaching materials 
 about both conflict and Peace.        </content>
