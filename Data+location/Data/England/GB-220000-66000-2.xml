		<content>   TOURISM ALSO PLAYS A PART. THERE IS 
 A CARAVAN CLUB SITE AT TRENANT, AND AT
 LOWER TRENGALE AND OTHER FARMS, FARM  
 GUESTS ARE TAKEN. THE AREA BOASTS A   
 TOURIST ATTRACTION IN GOLITHA FALLS ON
 THE RIVER FOWEY. DONIERT THE FIRST    
 CHRISTIAN KING IN CORNWALL DROWNED    
 HERE AND HIS MEMORIAL STONE IS ALSO IN
 THE BLOCK.                            
   FORESTRY IS ALSO IMPORTANT WITH     
 PLANTATIONS OF YOUNG CONIFERS, AND    
 STANDS OF DECIDUOUS HARDWOODS.        
  TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO CLUBS   
 BASED IN THE BLOCK, NOR ANY CHAPELS   
 STILL OPEN. THE CARAVAN SITE AT       
 TRENANT USES A CHAPEL AS WASHROOMS AND
 LAUNDRY, AND THIS STILL HAS A CEMETERY
 WHICH IS STILL MAINTAINED.            
  WITHOUT TRANSPORT THIS IS A HARD AREA
 IN WHICH TO LIVE.
