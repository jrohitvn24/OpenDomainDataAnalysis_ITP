		<title>13St.Matthew's Church Wookey</title>
		<content>  St.Matthew's Church is situated in   
 the village of Wookey. The present    
 incumbent, who has held the post for  
 two years, is the Reverend Bindon     
 Plowman. He lives in a new vicarage   
 built in the grounds of the much      
 larger, older vicarage.               
  The medieval church, which today     
 seats 280 people, is about 78 feet    
 long by 37 feet wide and has a square 
 tower which is 63 feet high.          
  The oldest parts of the present      
 church are the chancel wall, east     
 window and the font, which were       
 probably designed by a thirteenth     
 century architect in the pre-decorated
 style. The rest of the church,        
 except the S.E Chapel, was probably   
 built in the following 150 years. A   
 graveyard surrounds the church but    
 none of the dates on the gravestones  
 are older than the eighteenth century.</content>
