		<title>04SANDING IN KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>  This tradition of sanding has been   
 going on for over 900 years.  It is   
 believed that King Canute(1013-1045)  
 started the tradition.  Since then it 
 has been passed down from father to   
 son.  Ted Worrall is the last we know 
 of who has passed it down to the      
 present team. The people who do it now
 are Jimmy and Alfred Gilbert, Ray Keat
 and Colin Veal.  We hope that it will 
 be passed down and carried on by the  
 next generation.  Each year the sand  
 is coloured with dye which is dry     
 powder.  They have about six different
 colours of sand (red, yellow, orange, 
 white, blue and purple).  They have   
 lots of different patterns and        
 sometimes make up new ones.  The time 
 of year they do the sanding is on May 
 Day but they also do it at weddings.
