		<title>15Gamekeeping</title>
		<content> Gamekeeping is a{custom}which has been
 around for hundreds of years. It first
 became popular in the middle ages     
 because the landlords wanted the game 
 for food. Today, gamekeeping is much  
 the same as it has always been except 
 that the{guns}and{traps}are different.
 Gamekeeping is a dangerous job because
 there is always the possibility of    
 being attacked by{poachers.}The  guns 
 which are now used are more modern,   
 more powerful and quick to load. The  
 most popular guns are the 12 bore and 
 the .22. The most popular trap is the 
 snare which is often used.
