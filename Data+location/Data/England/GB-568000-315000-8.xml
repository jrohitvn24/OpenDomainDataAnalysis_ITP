		<content> An Interview with Miss Smith,a former 
 headteacher.                          
 Miss Smith has been retired for       
 several years now but she still lives 
 in a house next to the school. She    
 remembers the time when she first     
 became headteacher in 1939. The       
 playground was a surface of ashes     
 covered in shingle. The school had    
 four gardens divided by paths and     
 apple trees. There were only eight    
 boys in the school then so two looked 
 after each garden. There were no      
 school dinners and most of the        
 children went home at lunchtime but   
 some could not so they had a hunk of  
 bread and lard and some hot cocoa in  
 the winter which was made at the      
 school.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
