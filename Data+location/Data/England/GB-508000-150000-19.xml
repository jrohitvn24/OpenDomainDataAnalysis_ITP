		<content> This area of the 1985 Domesday Project
 was researched by members of Fetcham  
 Village Women's Institute.  We do     
 not live in E.Horsley but it was the  
 nearest available area to Fetcham.    
 Mrs. Mollie Bridge took the photo-    
 graphs and visited the Golf Club;     
 Mrs. Ann Brixey visited the old       
 people's homes; Mrs. Margaret Torr    
 with other members of the Institute's 
 Rambling Group investigated the wood- 
 land and flowers;  Mrs. Lesley Hignett
 researched the farms.  Other informa- 
 tion was also supplied by local       
 groups.                               
 Mrs. Enid Scriven &amp; Mrs. Barbara      
 Bennett researched the area generally,
 and with the help of Mrs. Mollie      
 Bridge wrote, edited &amp; finalised the  
 information.  We enjoyed ourselves.
