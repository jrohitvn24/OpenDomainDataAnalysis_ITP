 of which go through Fivw Acre Wood.   
 This is where A.A.Milne the famous

 onto the forest. One of the footpaths 
 runs onto Church Hill, locally known  
 as Black Hill, and continues in a     
 northerly direction to Withyham       
 Church. Fishers Gate includes a fine  
 Manor House, farm land and several    
 cottages all owned by Earl de la Warr,

 leading to Park Grove Farm and on to  
 Penns-in-the-Rocks.
