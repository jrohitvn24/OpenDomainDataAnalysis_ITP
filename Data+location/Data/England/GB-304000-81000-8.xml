		<title>08Childrens Games in Salterton</title>
		<content> The following games for children      
 are the most popular in Budleigh      
 Salterton.                            
{CHASE }Two teams of four people       
 make a place for jail. This could be a
 post.One team runs off and the other  
 team counts to twenty and then chases 
 them.Anyone caught is taken to        
 jail.They can be freed by being       
 touched.The game is over when the     
 whole team is in jail.                
{MONKEY}The catcher counts to fifty at 
 the post while the rest hide.When the 
 catcher sees someone he touches the   
 post and calls Monkey One Two Three   
 and Out.If the other gets to the post 
 first they shout Monkey One Two Three 
 and In.                               
{CONKERS }Two horse chestnuts are      
 threaded on string.One person holds   
 his conker while the other hits it.   
 They take turns until one smashes.    </content>
