		<title>13ABBOT HOLME FARM</title>
		<content>      In the area there are many       
 traditional Dales hill farms of about 
 50 acres, with milking cows and       
 grazing sheep forming the main income.
  Most of everyday is spent working    
 because the animals provide the income
 and therefore have to be kept alive.  
 Financially the farm is hard to run   
 because the price for the animals is  
 set and paid by external buyers and   
 can differ greatly between two similar
 animals.  To supplement the income of 
 the farm they did try bed and         
 breakfast for a while.  But the amount
 of extra income that this brought in  
 did not justify the work involved.    
      Self-sufficiency is a major      
 factor in small farms; the farmers'   
 families do not travel much beyond    
 Sedbergh and the cattle auction market
 at Hawes.  They use delivery services 
 from local grocery shops.             </content>
