		<content> Many People do not like being         
 invaded by the tourists except the    
 handful of traders who benefit        
 financially. Each year at the end of  
 August the 'Peace Women' come for a   
 short festival and to receive         
 'vibrations' from the stones. Most    
 villagers are against their visit but 
 some find them interesting and        
 harmless.                             
   When large numbers of people descend
 on the area, precautions are taken by 
 local people especially farmers who   
 block field entrances with farm       
 machinery. One carpark in the area is 
 blocked with barbed wire by the police
