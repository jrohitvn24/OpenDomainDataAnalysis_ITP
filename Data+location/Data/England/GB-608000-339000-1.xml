		<title>01High Kelling Woods &amp; Heath</title>
		<content> The area is flat with farmland,       
 coniferous woods and heathland.  The  
 soil is poor and light but ideal for  
 heather and Rhododendrons.   Greshams 
 School (public school founded in 1955 
 and recently turned co-educational)   
 provides employment &amp; shares its      
 facilities with the local community.  
 The major employment is at the two    
 hospitals.   Kelling Hospital (once a 
 TB sanatorium) serves the local       
 community and Pineheath Hospital cares
 for geriatrics.   Home place is being 
 converted to an old folks home.  High 
 Kelling has a high district church    
 (previously a sanatorium chapel) but  
 always parish status.   It has        
 recently developed in Holt, Kelling   
 and Bodham parishes.   It has an      
 attractive community centre entirely  
 built by amature labour, which serves 
 it's largely retired residents well.  </content>
