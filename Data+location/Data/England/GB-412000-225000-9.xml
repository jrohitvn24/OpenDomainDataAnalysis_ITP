		<title>09Cotswold Slates &amp; Dewponds</title>
		<content> Cotswold stone slates were dug on land
 at Eyeford Hill. The Slate Pits       
 Coppice now covers all the trenches   
 and old rail lines. The stone was dug 
 at Summertime and covered with piles  
 of earth to keep it moist. At a       
 certain time in Winter the church bell
 was rung to signal that the earth     
 should be removed so that the frost   
 split the strata of the stone into    
 thin sheets- Cotswold slates.         
 Dewponds were made at the time of the 
 Enclosure awards where field          
 boundaries crossed so that they       
 supplied water to all 4 fields in the 
 days when stock was kept on the farm. 
 Cattle were driven over a clay-lined  
 hollow to firm the ground so that it  
 would catch the dew and rain.
