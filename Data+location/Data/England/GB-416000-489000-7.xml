		<title>07MORE ABOUT THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The school uses the{Village Hall}for
 dining and for Physical Education in  
 wet weather.It has its own kitchen    
 where school meals are made.          
                                       
   The school is one of the smallest in
 North Yorkshire and indeed in the     
 country with only{13}pupils on the    
 register.The numbers have over recent 
 years steadily declined and may       
 decrease further bringing the danger  
 of closure to another village school. 
                                       
   In spite of such small numbers,the  
 parents work together to ensure that  
 the children are not disadvantaged    
 through lack of funds.                
                                       
   Two{teachers}are employed here,one  
 full-time and the other part-time     
 because the pupils are so few in      
 number.                               </content>
