		<title>09Home life in Alresford</title>
		<content> During weekends and holiday periods,  
 homelife in Alresford often revolves  
 around various hobbies and small tasks
 in the home. The people usually work  
 on their cars over the weekends, and  
 much of their spare time is also taken
 up gardening.  One particular hobby   
 that has become a part of the         
 homelife, is that  of D.I.Y. and home 
 improvements.  Other weekend          
 activities include sailing at         
 Alresford Creek, a sport in which the 
 whole family can participate and      
 fishing at the site of the old sand   
 and gravel pits which have now been   
 made into ponds. Pleasant country     
 walks and nature study hobbies also   
 take up a lot of the people's free    
 time, as do the various clubs and     
 societies that are run in Alresford.  
 About 10% of the population attend the
 local church, St. Andrews.            </content>
