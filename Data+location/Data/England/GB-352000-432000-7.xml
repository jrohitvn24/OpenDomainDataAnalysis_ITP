		<title>07Carmelite Convent.</title>
		<content> The convent built in 1917 takes about 
 5 acres of land. The nuns' main work  
 is to make communion wafers of flour  
 and water, spreading it onto hot      
 plates and a lid is brought down which
 prints the pattern. The brittle sheets
 are then put onto shelves in a warm   
 room to soften, then put through a    
 machine which cuts the wafers. They   
 are packed into boxes, and sent to    
 churches in the diocese. The nuns make
 100,000 small wafers per week and     
 nearly 3,000-4,000 larger wafers. They
 also make jumpers, dolls, cribs, shell
 ornaments, decorate egg shells, keep  
 poultry and have two hives of bees.   
 The nuns' rooms called cells are very 
 simple. Mass is celebrated daily at   
 8.00am. the day starts at 5.30a.m. and
 they go to their cells at 10.30pm.    
 There are 17 nuns and one postulant.
