		<content>I get up at 7.15 every morning except  
Sunday. I go down take a cup out of    
the cupboard make myself a drink then  
go back upstairs. I get dressed and    
sort out my bag. Then I go and have    
breakfast. I then wash and clean my    
teeth and brush my hair. I play with my
dog then go to knock for my friend.  We
get to school at about 8.45. At the    
start of school I go to my form room,  
first lesson is at 9, the next starts  
at 10 and break is at 11. The lesson   
after break finishes at dinner time    
which lasts for an hour. Afternoon     
school is 1.05 to 3.35. I wait for my  
friend and we walk home together. She  
waits at my house while I change then  
we go to her house and play. At about 6
I go home for tea after which I take my
dog for a walk. I then play outside    
with friends till about 9. I then read,
watch TV, do homework and go to bed.   </content>
