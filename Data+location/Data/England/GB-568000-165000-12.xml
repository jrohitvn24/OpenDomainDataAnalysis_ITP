		<content> Mr. Wadsworth owns the local          
 self-service grocery shop. It is in a 
 row of four shops in the main village 
 street. He sells fruit, salad         
 vegetables, cooked meats and general  
 groceries. He gets his stock delivered
 daily from wholesalers. His busiest   
 day is Saturday. His best selling item
 is potatoes. He has got two           
 storerooms, one for dry and smelly    
 goods and one for packet and tinned   
 goods. He opens his shop at 8.00am.   
 and closes at 5.30pm. and has a one   
 hour lunch break. He has three        
 assistants who work with him. His     
 takings are Â£2,000 per week, one      
 quarter of which he takes on Saturday.
