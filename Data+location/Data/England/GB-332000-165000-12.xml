		<title>12THE SCHOOL NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Two and a half acres of steeply sloped
 woodland at the back of Kewstoke      
 school has in the last three years    
 been developed into an area of study. 
 Aided by the Avon Wildlife Trust and  
 other bodies the children of the      
 school have helped to create from     
 rough, overgrown woodland a managed   
 site that has a pond, an open air     
 classroom and steps made of sycamores 
 cut down in the initial thinning      
 stages.                               
 The awards from the Shell Better      
 Britain  scheme have been won together
 with first prize in a competition run 
 by the Weston-super-Mare Civic        
 Society.  A birdhide is to be built   
 this Autumn (1985) from funds raised  
 at the School fete in June.
