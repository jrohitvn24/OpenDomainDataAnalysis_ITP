coast W.M.Stephens have a factory.The  
company which moved here in 1962 has as
its trade mark a picture of a dog      
wearing goggles.This is a reminder of  
the days when they made goggles for    
dogs travelling in the first motor     
cars! Today they make all kinds of     
safty wear and industrial clothing.Some
of this clothing is to keep men warm   
who work in cold places like the       
frozen food factoriei at lowestoft.    
Apart from this they also make donkey  
jackets,bodywarmers anoraks, fur       
jackets and duffle coats.Sixty people
