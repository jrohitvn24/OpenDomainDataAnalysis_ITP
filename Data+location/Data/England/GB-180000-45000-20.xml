{Old People's Homes.}Cornwall is an    
 attractive retirement area, increasing
 the percentage of older people in the 
 community.                            
 There has been an increase in         
 privately run homes and a decrease in 
 state run homes during the past 5 yrs.
{Government financing}and changes in   
 the DHSS rules have brought this      
 about.                                
 Each Rest Home has to be registered to
 the{Cornwall C.C.}The proprietor must 
 have certain nursing qualifications or
 employ others with the required       
 qualifications.                       
 The Rest Homes in the area have       
 numbers ranging from 5 to 35          
 residents. The new rules require a    
 room for each resident and not        
 dormitory type homes.
