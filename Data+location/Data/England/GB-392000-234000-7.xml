		<content> One game we play is{Britsh Bulldogs.  
 To play this game you have to choose a
 person to be on and then that person  
 says the name of another person who   
 has to run past the person who called 
 him without getting caught.If they are
 caught they help the catcher.         
  Another game is{Tag.}One person is on
 and he has to run after the others and
 tag them. Then they are on and they   
 have to tag someone.{                 
{Railings}.To play this you have to    
 have a wall. Someone is on and they   
 have to try and touch someone else.If 
 they touch someone else that person   
 has to go to the wall and lean against
 it with one arm straight out.Someone  
 else has to go under the person's arm 
 and if they do that person is free.The
 person who is on has to stop this from
 happening by tagging them first.
