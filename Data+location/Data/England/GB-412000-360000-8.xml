		<content> Tuesday May 24th, an interview with   
 the oldest inhabitant of Hartington,  
 90 yr old Miss Palfreyman. Ninety     
 years ago there was not a lot of money
 about. Toys were scarce with most     
 being made by parents. Whip and tops  
 were a favourite,they painted them    
 brightly, she recalls a friend sending
 his top through a ladies window.      
 Hartington School had 70 children on  
 roll. The school has changed since    
 then with 2 new extensions built on   
 inrecent years. A white horse named   
 Harriet brought groceries long ago    
 from nearby Warslow. During the 2nd   
 world war a bomb fell by the church,  
 thankfully no great damage was done.  
 Mrs Palfreyman worked at the cheese   
 factory during the war when there were
 only 5 staff. In coronation year, 1953
 the village celebrated with a dinner  
 at school.                            </content>
