		<title>03HOME LIFE in Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   Families tend to be interdependent  
 for example: they share child-care,   
 lifts into Cockermouth and heavy      
 lifting jobs (pianos, boilers, etc.)  
 Tools and experience are also shared  
 as houses are modernised (mostly Do-  
 It-Yourself improvements).            
   Due perhaps to Blindcrake's relative
 isolation, children play happily      
 together despite some wide gaps in    
 age. Ages range from two new babies to
 teenages with most between 5 to 11    
 years old.                            
   Food is purchased in nearby towns or
 from the several mobile shops that    
 visit each week. Supplementing these  
 are locally produced fruit, vegetables
 eggs, honey, etc.. Food is cooked and 
 homes heated with solid fuel (coal and
 wood), oil, electricity or bottled    
 gas. Thre is no mains gas supply.
