		<title>12Older Houses in Bristow Rd</title>
		<content> Bristow road was built in the late    
 1940's. It has a lot of older people  
 living there because they have done so
 ever since their childhoods.          
                                       
 There are also a lot of young families
 moving in because it is the cheaper   
 side of town and has good local       
 schools and facilities. Many of the   
 childen living in this area go to     
 Watchetts Middle and{France Hill      
{Secondary}schools.                    
                                       
 Recently, a lot of modernisation has  
 been done in Bristow Road: the houses 
 have been re-wired, had insulation put
 into the walls, been re-painted, and  
 have had new sink units put in.
