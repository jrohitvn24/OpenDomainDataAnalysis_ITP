		<title>06The Village Hall</title>
		<content> Hanley Swan village hall was built in 
 1956 and took six months to complete. 
 It was built as a memorial to the men 
 of the area who were killed in the two
 world wars.Itcost Â£5,000 and this was 
 collected through fund raising events 
 like concerts,whist drives and fetes. 
 The people of Hanley Swan and Hanley  
 Castle felt they needed a place where 
 they could meet together.             
         Today many people outside the 
 villages use the hall,this goes       
 towardsthe running costs,(50 bookings 
 a year).The hall serves the community 
 daily. Two mornings a week it is used 
 for a play_group.Not only does this   
 help to give mums a break, but also   
 the children get to know each other   
 which helps when they start school.   
 One family chose to live in Hanley    
 Swan because of the play_group.
