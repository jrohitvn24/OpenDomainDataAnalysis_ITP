		<content>  The{Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth}railway
 crosses the block.It is single track  
 and trains can pass each other at West
 -bury and Hanwood.At Stretton Heath   
 there is a manned level crossing.The  
 keeper lives by the track and comes to
 open the gates when you ring a bell.  
 When she is on holiday some workmen   
 operate it.They live in a yellow hut  
 across the other side of the line.    
 On Mondays to Fridays 9 passenger     
 trains go up the line to Aberystwyth  
 and 7 go down.9 go up and 8 go down on
 Saturdays and 1 goes in either direc- 
 tion on Sundays.{Yockleton}people can 
 board trains at{Shrewsbury.}          
  Some farmers have land on either side
 of the line so British Rail have built
 locked gates and given farmers the    
 keys.They have to listen for trains be
 -fore they unlock the gates to cross. 
 There have been some bad accidents.   </content>
