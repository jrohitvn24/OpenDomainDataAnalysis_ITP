		<content> Barton Manor.                         
   An oratory was founded here in 1272 
 by the rectors of Shalfleet and       
 Godshill.   It was surrendered in 1439
 and the lands were bestowed on the    
 College of Winchester.  Queen Victoria
  then bought the lands and the Prince 
 Consort made it his own farm.  The    
 Manor House is a pretty gabled        
 building.  Wine is grown and bottled  
 here and sells for around Â£3 - Â£4     
 abottle.  The manor is a tourist      
 attraction but not as popular or      
 extensive as the nearby Osborne House.
