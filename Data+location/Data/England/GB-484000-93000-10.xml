		<title>10A DAY IN SELSEY - 21.O6.85.</title>
		<content> On June 21st.1985 we asked people in  
 Selsey to write about their day.We    
 discovered that most people got up    
 between 7.30 and 8.00 and left for    
 work or school between 8.00 and       
 9.00.They ate their lunches between   
 1.00 and 1.30 mostly and tea at either
 5.15 or 6.30.Most people ate supper   
 between 8.00 and 8.30 and usually sat 
 in front of the television.Few        
 children or adults went to bed before 
 10.00.                                
    For breakfast people ate cereals,  
 especially muesli or cornflakes, bread
 sometimes toasted or fried,croissants,
 marmalade,eggs,bacon and drank        
 tea,coffee or fresh fruit juices.     
    For lunch many people ate          
 sandwiches,crisps and fresh fruit or  
 meat,fish salad,other vegetables.Most 
 drank coffee,fresh fruit juice or     
 water,a few drank wine.               </content>
