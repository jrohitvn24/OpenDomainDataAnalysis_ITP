 The Dene is situated north of the     
 village, Castletown, and south of the 
 ancient building, Hylton Castle.  It  
 lies in a west to east direction, with
 a small stream flowing east.  Recent  
 replanting has taken place in special 
 enclosures.  There are three          
 established groups of trees more than 
 80 years old.  The stream is          
 occasionally littered with assorted   
 rubbish and is overgrown in Summer.   
 The established forest area at the    
 centre of the  Dene ends in a shrubbed
 valley with marsh plants growing on   
 the valley floor.  The Dene has       
 generally retained its natural        
 wildness, some of the areas unchanged 
 in the last 50 years.  Used by local  
 people for walking; exercising dogs;  
 recreation; and access beyond         
 Castletown.                           </content>
