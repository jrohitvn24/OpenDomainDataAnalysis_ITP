		<content>   We carried out a survey to find out 
 something about{people's travel in    
 connection with their work.           
   We found that very few people live  
 within walking distance of their place
 of work.Most of the people we         
 contacted have a journey of about     
 twenty minutes and do not mind making 
 this journey.{Pinhoe}has a frequent   
 mini-bus service into Exeter which is 
 used by a lot of people who live in   
 that area. The rural areas have a     
 much less frequent bus service which  
 is only used by 5% in our sample.The  
 great majority of people travel to    
 work by private car.
