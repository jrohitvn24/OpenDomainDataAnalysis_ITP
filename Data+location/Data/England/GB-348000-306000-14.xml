		<title>14Jones'Restored Army Vehicles</title>
		<content>   Mr.Jones'dad started the garage in  
 1928,and Mr.Jones started to work on  
 the pumps when he was ten.He doesn't  
 sell cars now.He just mends them.His  
 special hobby is restoring 2nd World  
 War army vehicles.He has got 14       
 vehicles in his collection.They have  
 been in some films and television     
 serials.                              
   When we were there he was restoring 
 a D.U.K.W,a Tank,and an RAF staff car.
 The{D.U.K.W}is like a boat on wheels. 
 You could fit 50 people in the back   
 but it did not look like it. The seats
 in the front of the D.U.K.W are very  
 hard.The{Tank}is in bits at the       
 moment.I was surprised to see that    
 bullets had gone right through one    
 side of the tank's turret and marked  
 the other side.The{RAF staff car}had  
 blackout covers on the headlights so  
 that bombers could not see them.      </content>
