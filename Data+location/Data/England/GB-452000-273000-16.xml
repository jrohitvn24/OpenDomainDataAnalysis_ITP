		<title>16The Hardware Shop</title>
		<content>    The hardware shop is owned by Mr.  
 Brian Mc.Lean.He chose this kind of   
 shop through his previous experience  
 of working in home improvements.The   
 shop does not cover all the needs of  
 the people but he is learning what    
 brands people buy and is trying to    
 improve his outlets all the time.     
    Pricewise he is beating the town   
 shops with garden items like plants   
 and composts.THe hardware side of the 
 business is very competitive but the  
 paint he sells is an un-advertised    
 brand.                                
    It is mainly older people who come 
 in because they prefer the freindly   
 service,like items being carried out  
 to cars.However he does have customers
 from an area including Northhampton,  
 daventry and other places within a    
 twenty five mile radius.
