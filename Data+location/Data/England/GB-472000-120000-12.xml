 Council are the Planning Authority,   
 Hampshire County Council are the      
 Rating Authority, Southern Water are  
 responsible for sewage disposal and   
 Mid Southern Water supply the drinking
 water. {Health:}Doctors attend from

 About half of the houses are owner    
 occupied, and have been bought by     
 fairly wealthy retired people eg ex   
 Service Officers, company directors.  
 Property values are high and few young
 people move to the village.  Most     
 young people live on the council      
 estate.  New houses have been built   
 between High Street and Bones Lane and
 along the Petersfield Road.           </content>
