		<title>17KILMINGTON AND SHUTE WOODS</title>
		<content> The woods are made up mainly of       
 coniferous trees, but there are       
 deciduous trees growing around the    
 outer edges.                          
 Shute Wood is larger than Kilmington  
 Wood, and is all around Shute Hill.   
 Kilmington Wood grows on the hill near
 the Roman road.                       
 There are paths through both the woods
 and there is quite a lot of wildlife, 
 so it is a nice place for naturalists 
 to visit.                             
 Perhaps the greatest attraction is in 
 the autumn, when it is a popular place
 for collecting conkers and chestnuts, 
 as there are both horse chestnut trees
 and sweet chestnut trees.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
