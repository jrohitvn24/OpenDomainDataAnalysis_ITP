		<title>14POP FANS IN LAINDON</title>
		<content> Pop music amplifies from local        
 community centres where young people  
 are disco dancing or even playing live
 music in their own groups or bands.   
 There are several different kinds of  
 music at the moment such as soul, pop 
 and heavy metal.                      
{Soul}                                 
 Soul is funky, disco type music.      
 "Shakatak" are a soul group.          
{Pop}                                  
 Pop is popular music. "Wham" are one  
 of the most famous groups at the      
 moment. Girls in our school wear      
 tee-shirts with pictures of "Wham"    
 printed on them. They also decorate   
 their bedroom walls with magazine     
 pictures of the group.                
{Heavy Metal }                         
 Heavy Metal is sort of loud, drummy,  
 rock music. "Iron Maiden" are a heavy 
 metal group.                          </content>
