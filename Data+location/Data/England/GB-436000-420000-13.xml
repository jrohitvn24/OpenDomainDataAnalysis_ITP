		<content> After leaving school at 18 with some  
 "o" levels and "A" levels hopefully   
 tucked under my arm I hope to become a
 pro-footballer.After playing with     
 Altofts A.F.C. since I was 11,I hope  
 to have had some scouts to come and   
 whatch me play and hopefully be signed
 on by somebody.I will probably get a  
 part-time job for a while until I get 
 some money which I will buy a         
 semi-detached house with.I might get  
 married at 25 and probably have       
 children. I would like to go on       
 holiday abroad e.g. Spain, Italy and  
 Canada.                               
  The average wage for those who are   
 fortunate enough to be employed is    
 about Â£120 per week,where as a        
 footballer may earn 5 times as much.
