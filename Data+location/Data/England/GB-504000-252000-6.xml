		<title>06The Local Policeman</title>
		<content>    When interviewed, our 'friendly    
 policeman' said that the main crimes  
 in Brickhill were burglaries and some 
 vandalism. He thought the Homewatch   
 Scheme, which functions in street     
 groups, is very good because people   
 help each other by reporting any      
 unusual happening. Members of the     
 groups display a sticker in their     
 front windows with an eye on it.      
    The community policeman usually    
 rides around the area on a bicycle so 
 that he can get to know the people    
 living in it. He rarely travels by    
 Panda car.                            
    Much of his time is spent in       
 visiting schools and playgroups to    
 talk about safety and in running      
 cycling proficiency courses for the   
 older children. He also talks to adult
 associations on various subjects.
