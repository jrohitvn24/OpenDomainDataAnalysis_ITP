		<title>06Cliffe Common - Conservation</title>
		<content>      The Nature Conservancy Council   
 has advised Cliffe Parish Council on  
 two pieces of land it owns.           
{1. Broad Lane Wood. }This should have 
 a hedge along its northern side to    
 provide shelter and a barrier against 
 spray drift. The hazel bushes are     
 smothering ground plants and should be
 coppiced. There are few young trees,  
 and some of the seedling oaks growing 
 along the edge should be moved into   
 cleared areas.                        
{2. Ponds.}There are three shallow     
 ponds in a field near the crossroads  
 on Cliffe Common. These are rare in   
 areas of intensive farming, and they  
 have a lot of wildlife, including     
 frogs, toads and newts. Large dead    
 branches need removing, and herbicide 
 sprays and inorganic fertilisers      
 should not be used near the ponds.
