		<title>08Living at the Crematorium.</title>
		<content> My name is Libby Thompson and I live  
 at the Mid Warwickshire Crematorium as
 my father is the manager. I enjoy     
 living there as I get to see lots of  
 wild life and its very peaceful.      
 However because of the regulations    
 regarding crematoriums we do live in a
 very isolated spot.                   
  As I attend school in Bishop's       
 Tachbrook this is where most of my    
 friends live. It's too far to walk so 
 we travel to each others houses by    
 car,although we do talk a lot on the  
 telephone.                            
  Both my parents work so we do our    
 shopping in Leamington on a Saturday. 
  We are on Mains electricity but our  
 cooker is on propane gas and a tanker 
 collects our sewage.                  
  Many of my friends think a           
 crematorium is a creepy place to live,
 but I do not agree.                   </content>
