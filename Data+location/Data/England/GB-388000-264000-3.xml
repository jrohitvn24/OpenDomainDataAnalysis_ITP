 I have a video.I use it to record and 
 watch films and programmes.I watch it 
 mostly in the evening.                
 Today  we visited the supermarket     
 on Westlands (Boycott) Estate which   
 hires videos.It had about 200 to      
 select from.These included comedy,    
 thriller,childrens, sciencefiction,   
 horror and many others.They were all  
 graded.Gold star were Â£1.50 per night.
 Silver star were Â£1.25 per night and  
 ordinary were Â£1.00 per night.        
 We looked at the poster advertisements
 in the window.We saw Red Dawn and the 
 Philadelphia Experiment.Red Dawn was  
 about the Russians invading America.  
 It was about the possibility of World 
 War III starting.The Philadelphia     
 Experiment was about to visit the     
 future.  The video has become a very  
 popular pastime.                      </content>
