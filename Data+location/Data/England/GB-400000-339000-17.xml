		<content>Apart from Tean Mill in the High Street
there is one other small textile mill  
housed in the old St Thomas' school    
which employs 20 people.In the area    
there are some quarries producing sand 
and gravel mostly used for cement      
making.There are also some disused     
quarries that are now either waste land
or have been replanted with trees.     
There are three garden centres which   
are popular.                           
Some employment is provided by small   
transport firms carrying sand and      
gravel from the local quarries.These   
lorries do cause problems along some of
the narrow roads.There is a firm       
(Lymers) which has a fleet of coaches  
for tours and outings.
