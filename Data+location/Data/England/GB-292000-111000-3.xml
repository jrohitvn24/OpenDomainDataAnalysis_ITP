		<title>03Farming in the Tiverton Area</title>
		<content> We made a survey of how the           
 countryside in our D Block was being  
 used.  We viewed our whole area from  
 its highest point near a place called 
 Seven Crosses.  We saw a variety of   
 land uses:  eg Pasture for Sheep and  
 Cattle, Grassland for Hay and Sileage 
 and crops such as Barley.             
 We interviwed some farmers.  They told
 us that because the land around       
 Tiverton is fairly near moorland many 
 of the fields are boggy and do not    
 provide high quality pasture.  The    
 three main types of farming are Dairy,
 Beef and Sheep but a number of crops  
 are harvested as well.  We were       
 told that the average price of        
 farmland is about two thousand pounds 
 an acre.  This stops smaller farmers  
 expanding.  Another common complaint  
 was that EEC Milk Quotas made it hard 
 to keep profits up.                   </content>
