     As the traditional trawling fleet 
has declined the longshore fleet has   
greatly increased in numbers. Longshore
boats get their name because they only 
fish a few miles from shore. They are  
usually 30 to 60 feet long and carry a 
small crew of 3 to 6. They either use  
trawls or longlines to catch fish.     
Trawling is done by trailing a net on  
the bottom of the seabed catching cod, 
plaice, whiting, sole and skate.       
Longling is very different, miles of   
lines are strung out behind the boats. 
Each line contains hundreds of baited  
hooks attached to it by small strings  
called snuds. At regular intervals a   
small anchor weighs the line down on   
the seabed. This method is mainly used 
for dogfish and cod.
