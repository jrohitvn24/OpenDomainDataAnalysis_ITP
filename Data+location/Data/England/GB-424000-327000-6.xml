		<content> I am retired.I have lived in Egginton 
 for a few years.The first thing I do  
 is to get up.I get up at about 6.00am.
 The first thing I do is to have a cup 
 of tea.I take my time over my         
 Breakfast.I normally have porridge and
 tea or coffee and toast and marmalade 
 and thats lovely.By about 8.00am I've 
 finished my breakfast and my dog Job  
 thinks that its time to go for a walk.
 We take Job for a walk to the         
 field.After that I find there is lots 
 to do in the garden.Once or twice a   
 week my wife and I go shopping we go  
 to one of the supermarkets in Burton. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
