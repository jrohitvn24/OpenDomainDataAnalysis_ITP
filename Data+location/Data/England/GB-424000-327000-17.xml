		<title>17EGGINTON WELL DRESSING</title>
		<content> We have well dressings to ask God to  
 keep the wells full of water in       
 limestone country. Nowadays we have   
 them to make money for charity. Well  
 dressings have been going on for four 
 years in Egginton. There are eight    
 wells in Etwall and they are all      
 dressed. They are made with large     
 boards that have been soaked in the   
 brook for a week. They are coated with
 a mixture of clay, sand and water.A   
 picture is drawn by school children.  
 The design is marked out in alder     
 cones on the clay, then flower petals 
 and other natural materials are       
 pressed into the clay. It takes a week
 to mark out and petal. The completed  
 boards that are 2m. square may take   
 six men to lift them. The boards are  
 stood up against the well in Etwall.
