		<title>17GRAND UNION CANAL</title>
		<content> The canal that passes through Cowley  
 is the Grand Union Canal which runs   
 from London to Birmingham.The Grand   
 Union Canal was built to transport    
 cargoes such as cotton,wool,coal,wood,
 building materials,flour,meat and     
 vegetables.The barges were originally 
 pulled by horses walking along the    
 towpath but the horses were replaced  
 by engines.Most of the long boats tied
 up along the canal now are used as    
 homes or pleasure craft.Cowley lock   
 was built in 1893 and two of the      
 original gates are still used now.It  
 is lock no.89.Locks are needed where  
 the land slopes to allow the boats to 
 travel up or down hill in short       
 stages.At Cowley lock there is a      
 public house_The Shovel,the lock      
 keeper's house and a toll house.
