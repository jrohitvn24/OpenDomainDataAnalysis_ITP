		<title>02TOURISM ON WHIPSIDERRY BEACH</title>
		<content> On the 5.7.85 we interviewed tourists 
 on Whipsiderry Beach.It was an        
 overcast morning so we could only talk
 to ten people.Nine said that they     
 found the area interesting, but the   
 tenth had only arrived the night      
 before.Those who had been on the beach
 said that it was flat, sandy and      
 clean, with plenty of room for        
 children.They said that the scenery   
 was lovely but the steps which led to 
 the beach seemed slightly dangerous   
 although the sea seemed reasonably    
 safe. They found the beach rarely     
 became overcrowded. A lot of them     
 enjoyed walking on Porth Headland. The
 people we interviewed were on holiday 
 for two weeks and one lady has come to
 the area on holiday every year for    
 forty years. The people said that they
 could get most of the things they     
 needed at the nearby shops.           </content>
