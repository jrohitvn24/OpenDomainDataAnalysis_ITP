		<title>01The villages of St. Agnes</title>
		<content> St. Agnes is a popular holiday village
 set in the spectacular cliffscape of  
 the Heritage Coastline of north       
 Cornwall.  Mithian is a particularly  
 quaint sleepy village of thatched     
 cottages and more modern houses with  
 its 16th century pub "The Miners Arms"
 at its centre. The village of         
 Silverwell has frequently hosted the  
 West of England Steam Traction Engine 
 Annual Rally in August.               
 A peaceful, rural community is found  
 alongside the relics of a wealthy tin 
 mining past; and the gaunt, deserted  
 engine houses provide a spectacular   
 backdrop for the setting sun.         
 The hustle and bustle of the seasonal 
 holiday trade sees everyone putting   
 great effort into the annual Carnival 
 and Victorian Fayre.  In the mild     
 winter climate many societies and     
 clubs flourish in the community.      </content>
