		<content>    Joseph Norton built a row of houses
 known as the Fleet. They were         
 designed with peoples comfort in mind,
 the upper floor being used to house   
 looms and weaving accessories, to keep
 them separate from the living room.   
    Later, Saville St. and Water St.   
 were built but there was no provision 
 for weaving because this had moved to 
 the mills.                            
    In the middle 19th century the     
 village expanded rapidly and the      
 Norton Bros. employed 1000 workers.   
    The rapid expansion meant a        
 shortage of church space and St.      
 Augustines was built and consecrated  
 in 1839. The chancel was added in     
 1901.
