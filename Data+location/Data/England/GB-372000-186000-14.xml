		<title>14HISTORICAL WICKWAR (2)</title>
		<content> WICKWAR WAS A TOWN THAT MANUFACTURED  
 CLOTH IN THE MIDDLE AGES.IT MUST HAVE 
 BEEN RATHER IMPORTANT FOR IT WAS      
 GRANTED  A CHARTER BY A KING SO THAT  
 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AS A BOROUGH       
 c.1285. A MONTHLY MARKET AND A BI-    
 ANNUAL FAIR COULD BE NOW BE HELD IN   
 WICKWAR.                              
 THE "PACK HORSE "BRIDGE WAS THE       
 CROSSING USED BY THE TRADERS AS THEY  
 TRAVELLED AROUND BUYING AND SELLING.  
 THE PRESENT CHURCH WAS BUILT IN       
 1500A.D. AND IS DEDICATED TO THE HOLY 
 TRINITY.EVIDENCE DOES EXIST OF AN     
 EARLIER CHURCH, PROBABLY BUILT BY THE 
 LORD OF THE MANOR.THE CHURCH IS IN    
 VERY GOOD ORDER AND CONTAINS SOME     
 INTERESTING MEMORABILIA.              
 THE TOWN HALL HAS WHAT IS REGARDED AS 
 THE OLDEST WORKING TOWN HALL CLOCK IN 
 THE COUNTRY ON ITS RECENTLY           
 REFURBISHED STONEWORK.                </content>
