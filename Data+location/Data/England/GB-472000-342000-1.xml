		<title>01Car Colston and environs</title>
		<content> Latterly Car Colston has largely      
 become a commutor villiage with       
 expensive houses, but Screveton and   
 Hawksworth remain principally farming 
 villages. The ususal materials are    
 brick and pantile and both Brunsell   
 Hall and Beech clos are seventeenth   
 century Grade II listed buildings.    
 Car Colstons Little Green and nearby  
 grass paddocks and coverts support    
 abundant wildlife but the predominant 
 land use is arable farm land cropping 
 winter cereals and oil seed rape.     
 Wooda are mainly deciduous, and       
 several are newly planted, Ash is the 
 predominant hedgerow tree and numerous
 streams drain into the Car Dyke.      
 Older established families include    
 Blagg (1743) Gilbert Martin Thurman   
 and in ScrevetonMarsh and             
 Willis.(Blacksmiths).
