 This picturesque area is made up of   
 rolling farmland with the River Tees  
 running through the southern edge in a
 sweeping meander.The area is close to 
 the large Cleveland industrial area   
 served by Teesside Airport,whose      
 runways cover approximately one sixth 
 of the block.There are almost no      
 amenities and people must go to other 
 areas. There is a church in the midst 
 of farmland,but the only residential  
 area of Low Worsall,with its village  
 green,lies on the south bank,with no  
 bridging point to give access to the  
 northern bank. There is an important  
 pumping station at Low Worsall. The   
 area is not in any way a cohesive     
 community with the block lying in     
 North Yorkshire,Cleveland and County  
 Durham.
