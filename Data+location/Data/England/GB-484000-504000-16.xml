 Residents in the southern and upper   
 end of Sleights village are served by 
{regular buses along the A169}to Whitby
 and also to Pickering, though these   
 are less frequent.                    
                                       
 The nearest railway station is  at the
 northern end of Sleights by the River 
 Esk about a mile from the "top" of the
 village.This is the{Esk Valley Line}  
 between Whitby and Middlesborough.    
                                       
{Private transport}is the norm for most
 residents, a great asset to visitors, 
 and often essential for residents who 
 work outside the area.Lack of such    
 transport restricts shopping and      
 entertainment choices and is sometimes
 a serious problem for the elderly.
