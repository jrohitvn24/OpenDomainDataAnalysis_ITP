		<content>  My aim in life is not to end up on   
 the dole que but to have an active and
 meaningful life.I would like to go    
 into scientific career and maybe some 
 day reach the stage of being able to  
 take part in space technology.If this 
 career does not work out I would like 
 to become a teacher in a middle       
 school.My main subjects would be,again
 science and probably maths.Being a    
 teacher in ten years time will        
 probably be totally different to what 
 teachers are like now.I think that I  
 would be correct in saying that there 
 will be more advanced equiptment used 
 and maybe new subjects taught,        
 therefore giving the children a better
 education than we are receiving now.
