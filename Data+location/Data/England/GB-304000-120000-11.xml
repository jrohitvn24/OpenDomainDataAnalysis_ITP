		<content>            Cricket.                   
       Cricket has been played at      
 Appley for over a hundred years. Until
 recently it was the main event each   
 week for most local people between    
 April and September. Now the age of   
 the cricketers is increasing as fewer 
 young people seem interested in       
 playing. The area has produced some   
 very good players and some have been  
 chosen to go for County trials.       
       The local team play against     
 others from as far away as Taunton and
 Allerford. After a match at the       
 cricket field the teams and their     
 families often go to the Globe Inn for
 refreshment. It becomes very busy.    
       The Ashbrittle and Stawley      
 Cricket Club are such a good team that
 they are in the top division of the   
 West Somerset League.
