		<title>16WASTE DISPOSAL IN HAILSHAM</title>
		<content>   In the Waste Disposal Unit there are
 19 lorries in use and 7 spares that   
 are old.                              
   The waste disposal unit has roughly 
 152 tons of rubbish coming in every   
 day.                                  
   Dustmen would like people to be     
 careful what they put in dustbins.    
 Broken glass can be dangerous to the  
 dustmen even though they wear gloves. 
 Some people put metal in dustbins and 
 this can ruin the mechanism of the    
 dust lorry. Chemicals, asbestos and   
 bricks are also dangerous.            
   At the moment there are 80 workers  
 but soon there will be fewer employed 
 workers because wheel dustbins will be
 used and Can Banks introduced.        
 Glass is the only rubbish to be       
 recycled at the moment.
