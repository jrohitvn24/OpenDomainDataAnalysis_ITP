		<content> In a village where there is relatively
 little unemployment the life style of 
 its inhabitants is as much tied to    
 personal preferences as to finance.   
 The exceptions are the few families   
 with sufficient income to employ part 
 or full time help and entertain       
 regularly.  The families of           
 farmworkers tend to have a full       
 mid-day meal at noon and tea in the   
 evening.  Those whose menfolk travel  
 farther to work or who are used to so 
 doing have a light lunch and an       
 evening supper or dinner.  Television 
 has changed rising and bedtime habits,
 but older folk are generally in bed   
 before l0 p.m.  The urban retired     
 people keep later hours as do the     
 younger families.  7 a.m. is the      
 normal rising time.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
