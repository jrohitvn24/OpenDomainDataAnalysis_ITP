		<title>08EDUCATION IN BEWCASTLE</title>
		<content> Within the survey zone there now      
 exists only a primary school, which   
 serves the whole of the area and the  
 surrounding parish.Formerly there was 
 another school about a mile away to   
 the north-east but it is now ruined.  
     State education in the area starts
 at the age of three when the children 
 can go on the nursery-bus , a         
 converted mini-bus which goes round to
 farms picking up young children and   
 either taking them into school or     
 providing a session actually in the   
 bus.At four the children move into the
 primary school full-time , being      
 brought there each day by a carefully 
 organised system of taxis. At present 
 there are 42 children in the school in
 two classes.When aged eleven the      
 children move to Longtown School,     
 again being transported there by      
 special bus.                          </content>
