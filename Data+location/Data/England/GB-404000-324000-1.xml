{ABBOTS BROMLEY}is the main residential
 area in this block. Old houses line   
 the long village street, with new     
 housing developments behind           
 them. Abbots Bromley is famous for{THE
{HORN DANCE.}The village was a thriving
 market town but the railway bypassed  
 it and it is now a large village.     
    The whole landscape is an          
 intensively farmed dairy area with    
 some remnants of the {NEEDWOOD FOREST.
 Part of Blithfield Reservoir is in    
 this block. Abbots Bromley is within  
 easy reach of Uttoxeter, Rugeley,     
 Burton-on-Trent, Stafford and         
 Lichfield.                            
    Farming is the main occupation with
 other people travelling to work in    
 nearby towns.
