		<content>  At Clipston School there are several 
attics.  If you climb up the ladder    
into the very top attic by the clock,  
it is said that you can hear footsteps.
If you are very lucky, or unlucky as   
the case may be, a man's head, with    
long black shaggy hair and blood on it 
appears.  It is said that the blood    
comes from his ear that has been partly
severed.  No-one knows whether this is 
really true or not, or where this      
character may have come from.
