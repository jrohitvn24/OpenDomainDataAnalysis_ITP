 downstairs to make me,Alex and Emily  
 some breakfast.Then she leaves us to  
 get dressed.When she is dressed she   
 shouts at my brother to brush his     
 hair.                                 
   When we are ready she takes us to   
 school in the car and she goes        
 shopping.She goes shopping in Arnold  
 and Nottingham.On the way back from   
 shopping she collects Alex and Emily  
 from school.                          
   When I get home from Caroline's     
 house she makes our tea and then we go
 swimming.Afterwards we have fish and  
 chips.Mum goes to bed at about 11.30  
 p.m.
