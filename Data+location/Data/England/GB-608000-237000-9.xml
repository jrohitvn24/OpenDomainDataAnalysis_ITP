		<title>09Mushroom Farm</title>
		<content>At the Mushroom Farm two men showed us 
around.The farm is 7 acres and has been
there for 23 years.To grow mushrooms   
they use horse and chicken manure.The  
manure takes 5 weeks to prepare.After 2
weeks it is put in a room and heated to
160 degrees to kill germs.After it has 
cooled down wheat or millet seeds      
covered with mushroom spores are put   
in.Chalk,peat and water are put on top.
One week later tiny mushrooms appear   
all over.From this manure they are able
to get 8 crops before new batch is     
needed.They have 5 men,13 women and 4  
boys to prepare,grow and pick 1600     
boxes (3lb),each week from the 13      
growing sheds
