		<title>02The Life of a P.K</title>
		<content>First of all P.K stands for parsons    
kid, which I happen  unfortunately, to 
be. Take it from me if your dad's the  
local vicar your life is not gonna be  
worth living. For a start vicars don't 
earn much money and all your mates at  
school don't seem to understand why you
haven't got the latest craze. " I spose
you give all your money to the poor " I
ask you what money ? Theres the teasing
as well. "Holy" "Good" and because I   
have glasses and am about to have a    
brace "Four eyes" "Goggles" and "Mesh  
mouth". Mind you I like being who I am 
it's fun. One monday I will describe to
you. I woke up late, rushed downstairs,
ate my breakfast, called my brother,   
fed the rabbit, grabbed my bag and ran 
to school. School was uneventful I got 
home, played my guitar, had tea,       
watched t.v and  went to bed. Here you 
have Me.        Caroline Sceats        </content>
