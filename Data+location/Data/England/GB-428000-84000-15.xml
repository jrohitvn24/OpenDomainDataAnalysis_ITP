		<title>15A VET'S LIFE AND WARREN FARM</title>
		<content>  My dad is a vet,he works for the     
 Ministry of Agriculture.He helps      
 prevent diseases from coming on to the
 island.He works from 8:30 to 5:00,but 
 if something is urgent,he could be    
 called at any time.There are only a   
 few diseases on the island.My         
 dad helps to keep diseases like rabies
 off the island.Our island was the last
 place to have foot and mouth          
 disease.My dad also goes round farms  
 to check if the animals are okay and  
 that the animals are treated properly.
 Warren Farm is a dairy farm.We buy    
 our milk from the farm.Warren farm is 
 built on the Warren.
