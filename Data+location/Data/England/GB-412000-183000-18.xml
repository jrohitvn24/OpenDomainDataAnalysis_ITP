		<title>18Magic Roundabout in Swindon.</title>
		<content> The Magic roundabout is one of        
 Britain's busiest traffic spots. Over 
 24 million vehicles use it every year,
 which is almost 2,500 vehicles every  
 hour of every day. Clearly it is the  
 worst accident spot in Wiltshire.     
 At this point 5 main roads converge   
 and once created long traffic jams.   
 A new type of roundabout was pioneered
 here and has proved very successful.  
 Locsl people always called it the     
 "Magic roundabout" but the  local     
 council named it "County roundabout". 
 After many years of public pressure   
 the name has been officially changed  
 to the "Magic roundabout".
