		<title>05Birkenhead Park</title>
		<content>   Birkenhead Park was the first public
 park  in the  country.  We like it for
 its  open spaces  to play in,  for its
 sports areas, for its quiet  places to
 walk in and  because it costs nothing.
 However, some  people thought a  small
 entrance fee might keep out the people
 who destroy things.                   
                                       
{Our park is so big and great          
{No need to pay-just go through a gate.
{There's a gate and rocks to climb     
{So come-on in-have a good time        
{There are swings and things           
{And magnificent trees                 
{Plants and flowers up to your knees   
{Shades and shades of green on green   
{The swiftest squirrels you have seen  
{And with Central Park a mere copy of  
{ this-                                
{We think our park is bliss.
