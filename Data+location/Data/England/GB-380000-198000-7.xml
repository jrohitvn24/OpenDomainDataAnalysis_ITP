		<title>07Cattle at Upper Lutheredge.</title>
		<content>   Cattle are bought from dairy farmers
 at{6}months of age.They are then      
 kept for a further{18}months.         
   The beef cattle are put into two    
 different age groups.The young cattle 
 vary in age from 1-18 months, and the 
 older cattle are aged between 18      
 months and 2 years.When they reach 2  
 years they are taken to the slaughter 
 house in Malmesbury.In Winter the     
 cattle are kept in barns,and in the   
 Summer they graze in the fields on the
 hillside. The farmer crossbreeds      
 cattle. The black white-faced heifer's
 father is a Hereford and the mother   
 is a Friesian.The pure black ones     
 have an Aberdeen Angus for a father.  
   The farmer's sons feed the cattle in
 the morning.Formerly the straw bales  
 were rectangular but now they are     
 circular.Each weighs 2-3kilos and is  
 1.25 metres high.                     </content>
