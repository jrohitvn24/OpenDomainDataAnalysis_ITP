		<content> The opening of the by-pass has been   
 the first step towards                
 "gentrification" of the village and   
 consequent increasing house prices{(3 
{bedroomed terraced house  Â£26,500)}put
 many houses out of reach of first time
 buyers in this locality{(Average farm 
{worker earns Â£4,500 per year)}.County 
 Durham's Structure Plan only allows   
 infill housing and the local authority
 have no plans for more council houses 
 in the village.The departure of young 
 married couples because of failure to 
 secure housing at reasonable cost can 
 only compound all the other problems  
 of rural areas.Successive government  
 legislation seems to have led to      
 there being many vacant houses which  
 could form part of the rented private 
 sector,though a recent review of      
 Listed Buildings seems to be bringing 
 these houses onto estate agents books.</content>
