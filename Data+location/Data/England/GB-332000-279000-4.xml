		<title>04COMMUNICATIONS IN CLUNTON</title>
		<content> The telephone system is maintained by 
 British Telecom from a central        
 installation at Aston-on-Clun. The    
 exchange is "Little Brampton" the name
 taken from the hamlet at the          
 crossroads of the Clun_Craven Arms_   
 Bishop's Castle roads known locally as
 the Top Road or the Bank. Wind, storms
 and lightning can put the lines out of
 action but they are soon repaired.    
    Post is delivered by van once a    
 day. The grapevine fills the vacuum   
 left by all the offical systems.      
 Messages, parcels and odds and ends   
 are carried by local bus, milklady,   
 postman, Meals on Wheels, and the     
 Library van. The Parish magazine      
 spreads the gospel ecclesiastical and 
 secular. Coffee mornings, the bar of  
 the Crown Inn at Clunton, and the     
 notice board at Clunton also serve    
 their part.                           </content>
