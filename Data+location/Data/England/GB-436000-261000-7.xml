		<content>                                       
  The community of Ufton and Bascote   
Heath have no community health         
facilities. If illness or injury can   
not be self-treated the residents have 
to travel to nearby Harbury village or 
the small town of Southam (1km. and    
3km. respectively). Here they will find
two 3 doctor practices. Other practices
are available at Radford Semele and    
Royal Leamington Spa further along the 
A 425 road. The nearest hospital is at 
the town of Warwick nearly seven miles 
away.                                  
  Most of the time the people of this  
area treat their own illnesses and     
injuries.                              
  The situation is similar in terms of 
veterinary services for animals.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
