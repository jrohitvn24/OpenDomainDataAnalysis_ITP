		<content> One game we play is called"Time Bomb".
 Everyone has to stand in a circle and 
 the person who starts needs a ball.   
 They throw a ball to someone and if   
 that person drops the ball they must  
 run round all the players before they 
 count down from ten to one. If they   
 don' make it back in time they have to
 take their turn in the middle of the  
 circle.                               
  Aother game we play is "Piggy in the 
 Middle". Someone stands in the middle 
 with two people on either side of him 
 or her. The ones on the outside throw 
 a ball to each other and the middle   
 one has to try to get it. If he gets  
 it he changes places with the person  
 who threw it.                         
  "Two ball" is where you get two balls
 and juggle with them until you drop   
 one.
