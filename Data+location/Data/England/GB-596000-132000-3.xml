   The major centre for leisure and    
 recreation is in the nearby town of   
 Ashford. However, there are a variety 
 of local activities which occur.      
   Cricket is the main summer activity 
 in the local villages.Warehorne has   
 its own cricket field where matches   
 take place on Sundays.Football takes  
 over in the winter, matches being     
 played on Saturdays.                  
   To the north of our area is         
 Hempstead Forest which is a combined  
 nature trail for walkers and a picnic 
 site.                                 
   There are many local footpaths in   
 the area and part ot the Saxon        
 Shoreway Footpath passes through the  
 south of our area.
