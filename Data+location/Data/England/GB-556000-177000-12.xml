 redundant and leased to Adventure

 was a stopping place for Canterbury   
 Pilgrims before they crossed the      
 Thames.Now it is surrounded by        
 industry.The huge Proctor &amp; Gamble    
 plant towers above it.On the other    
 side is Thurrock Power Station.Close  
 by is a Ford motor plant,DAF Trucks,  
 Blue Circle Cement,Thermalite,Bowater 
 Scott and a number of haulage         
 companies.this has been called the    
 most heavily industrialised square    
 mile in Britain.                      
     It is known as "The Ark"and is a  
 community hobby centre where young    
 people can make things for            
 others-invalid ramps for public       
 buildings,toy repairs and furniture
