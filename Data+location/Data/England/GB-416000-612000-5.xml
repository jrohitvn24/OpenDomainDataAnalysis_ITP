{A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY}       
 My family get up at 8a.m.             
 We have cornflakes.  We get our shoes 
 on. We walk to school.  My dad works  
 at Sterling Winthrop.  They make      
 medicine and pills.  My mum works at  
 Alnwick South School at night time so 
 my Aunty Avril looks after me till    
 5.00p.m.  My dad comes home then and I
 get changed for Cubs.  At 7.00p.m. I  
 go home and I go to bed.  My dad and  
 mum watch television or the video or  
 work on the computer and go to bed    
 later.  My Uncle Nathan works at the  
 pit.  There are two different shifts, 
 day and night shifts.  They go on a   
 blue bus. The police don't go with    
 them any more because the strike is   
 over.  But people don't use as much   
 coal as they used to because of       
 electricity gas and oil. We have gas. </content>
