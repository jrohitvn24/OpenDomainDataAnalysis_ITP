		<content>The church of St.James the Less in     
Sulgrave was built in the reign of     
Edward lll (1327-77) but its stones    
were brought from an earlier church    
built near the disused windmill.       
Today the church offers one service    
each Sunday morning and an evensong    
once a month.It shares its incumbent   
with Thorpe Mandeville and Culworth.He 
conducts services of marriage,baptism  
and burial of the dead.The Mothers'    
Union meet once a month.               
At Harvest Festival the church is      
decorated with vegetables,flowers and  
fruit and the service attended by a    
large proportion of the community.At   
Christmas and Easter special services  
are held and the children from the     
village school take part with songs,   
prayers,poems, paintings and hand-bell 
ringing.
