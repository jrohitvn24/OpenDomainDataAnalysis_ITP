		<content> The age of buildings varies from the  
 timber framed Elbridge 15th C, Tudor  
 Cottage 1596 with its crow stepped    
 chimney to modern bungalows. Most     
 characteristic are the soft red brick 
 houses with peg tiled roofs + string  
 courses built in the 1630-60 period   
 with bricks from the Archbishops      
 Palace at Bekesbourne e.g. the        
 cottages on the green, Swanton Farm,  
 Old Waterways Cottage. Also of this   
 period are the flemish gables seen on 
 Higham, The Old Vicarage, The Anchor  
 + Post Office. There are several      
 terraces of the 19th C. early and     
 late, Edwardian tiling + 1920's type  
 development along Jubilee Road. There 
 are 4 main developments of modern     
 houses + bungalows, one built in the  
 garden of the Old Rectory, the others 
 on orchards. Postwar houses were built
 on the Hill to replace bombed ones.   </content>
