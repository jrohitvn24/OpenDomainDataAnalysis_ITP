		<content> We explored the North _ West corner of
 our square. In the residential area   
 were some lovely well kept gardens.   
 Most of the houses were built in the  
 1930s but many of them had been       
 modernized with things like double    
 glazing. They were made of brick with 
 the top half made of pebble dash. The 
 houses in Whitehouse Gardens were     
 terraced &amp; fairly new. Millbrook Road 
 was very busy. I think it is dangerous
 because the cars go fast. I don't     
 think this area has any problems.
