		<content>Boundary Way is a road on the edge of  
Warstones estate. It is called Boundary
Way because it is on the boundary      
between Wolverhampton and              
Staffordshire.On Boundary Way is       
Highfields School. Highfields is where 
most of the local children go when they
are 11 years old. They usually leave   
when they are 16 but can stay on until 
they are 18.                           
Farther down Boundayr Way are the      
allotments. My dad owns an allotment   
which he shares with the Callows. We   
go down to the allotment twice every   
week and if one family cannot come the 
other is always there. We grow goose-  
berries, strawberries,broad beans, peas
tomatoes, cabbages, onions and marrows.
When all the fruit and vegetables are  
grown we share them between the two    
families. The allotment is rented from 
the council.                           </content>
