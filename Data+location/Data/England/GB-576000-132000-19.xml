		<title>19BENENDEN WEALD, ROADS.</title>
		<content> Two roads run from east to west across
 our block each with a different       
 character.  The B2086, Swattenden Road
 is a wide well-surfaced road in       
 comparison to the narrow winding      
 Nineveh Lane, weathered and sunken.   
 The road runs mainly along the top of 
 the hill only once dipping gently to  
 cross a stream. The lane frequently   
 drops steeply into valleys to cross   
 small headstreams of the Rother. Old  
 and new houses border the road with   
 the landscape being generally open and
 fairly flat, and several services are 
 here. The lane has a few farms, some  
 of sandstone and there are no services
 along its length as it runs through a 
 landscape of steep hills and woods    
 with high hedges often almost meeting 
 overhead. Traffic speeds along the    
 road but has to advance slowly round  
 the corners of the lane.              </content>
