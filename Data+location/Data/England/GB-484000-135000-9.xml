		<title>09Clubs Around Grayshott</title>
		<content>      In{Grayshott}there are many{clubs
 such as{Path Finders, Sunday School,  
{Womens Institute (W.I.)}and many, many
 more.{Path Finders}is like{Sunday     
{School}but a lot more fun. We sing    
 songs which surprisingly the boys     
 like, we pray after singing, then we  
 listen to a sermon type thing but it  
 is much easier for us to understand   
 than the sermon or talk in{Church.    
 After the sermon or talk we have a    
 game where the girls compete against  
 the boys.                             
      Once we have finished this we are
 offered a drink and biscuits. Then we 
 normally play a game like crab        
 football, it is lots of fun.{Sunday   
{School}is sometimes all prayer and    
 compared with{Path Finders}is not much
 fun at all. When I went to{Sunday     
{School}the only thing I liked was the 
 story from the{Bible.                 </content>
