		<content> Abreast/herringbone milking parlours  
 are used.  There is a computer        
 controlled concentrate input on one   
 farm.  Milk goes into jars then by    
 pipeline into a stainles-steel        
 refrigerated tank.  Milk Marketing    
 Board tankers collect daily.  Milk    
 goes to Bamber Bridge for pasteurising
 and resale; to Garstang for cheese; or
 Kendal for butter.  Concentrates have 
 been reduced since milk quotas were   
 introduced and there is some anxiety  
 about future policy of Government and 
 E.E.C. toward dairy farming.  Silage  
 quality this year (l985) was poor     
 because of the wet summer; the barley 
 was harvested late; and more          
 concentrates were needed to maintain  
 the milk quality and yield.
