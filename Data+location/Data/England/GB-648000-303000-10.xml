		<title>10PUBLIC OPINION IN BRADWELL</title>
		<content>   When we interviewed people in the   
 village we asked them what they       
 thought of some of the amenities.     
   Everyone was pleased with the{Health
{Centre}because before it was opened   
 the nearest chemist was in Gorleston  
 and there were no dentists in the     
 village.                              
   We asked people if they attended    
 clubs or activities in the{Community  
{Centre.}We found that the only people 
 who used the Centre were mothers with 
 young children or the old aged        
 pensioners. There are, though, quite a
 variety of activities such as whist   
 drives, playgroup, over 60's, flower  
 club and discos.                      
   The new traffic lights on Beccles   
 Rd. were not very popular. Older      
 people said there was not enough time 
 to cross the road and others thought  
 it held up traffic unnecessarily.     </content>
