		<title>02AGE OF NORTH CAVE CHURCH</title>
		<content>     The real age of our church is not 
 known but we do know that the first   
 Rector worked there in 1175 so the    
 time the church was built must be some
 time near that.   The best guess at   
 the age of the church is 900 years'   
 old.  The style of the windows is also
 around that time.                     
                                       
     The Normans were the people who   
 built the first part of the church.   
 This church was not as big as the one 
 you see today.   When the Normans     
 built the church, the tower was very  
 much shorter, the roof was lower and  
 the hall was not as wide.   Since then
 the church has been made bigger and a 
 clock, porch and pinnacles have been  
 added.
