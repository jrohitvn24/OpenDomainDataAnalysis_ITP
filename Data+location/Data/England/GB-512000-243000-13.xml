		<title>13Mrs Diggle's Day</title>
		<content> One of the oldest citizens of Old     
 Warden is 73 year old Mrs Diggle who  
 has lived there since l936.           
   Her house was once a vicarage.  It  
 is approximately 200 years old  and   
 stands in 14 acres of land.  Her three
 part-time gardeners help look after   
 the estate.                           
   Her day consists of getting up at   
 8.15am and and having breakfast       
 at 9.00 am.  Later she feeds her      
 Guinea Fowl, Bantams and two donkeys  
 then sometimes she does some          
 gardening.                            
   She has lunch at 1 pm.  She then    
 visits friends in the afternoon.  Her 
 main meal is at 7.30 in the evening.  
 After dinner she watches television   
 and reads.  Mrs Diggle loves Old      
 Warde; she finds it a friendly        
 village.                              
                                       </content>
