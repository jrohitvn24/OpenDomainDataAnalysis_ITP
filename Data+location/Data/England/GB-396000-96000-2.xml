		<content>{Corfe Mullen}was once said to be the  
 second largest village in Europe.Today
 it is a thriving residential area,    
 serving the Bournemouth and Poole     
 areas.Most of Corfe Mullen is         
 recent,built within the last 20 years.
                                       
 Construction of estates has slowed,   
 although a few homes and other        
 facilities are still being built.     
                                       
 The main cultural,commercial and      
 sporting centres are to be found in   
 nearby Bournemouth and Poole,but many 
 businesses have relocated to the      
 cheaper land of the outer suburbs.    
 These are mainly service industries.
