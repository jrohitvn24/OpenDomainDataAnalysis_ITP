		<content>Local farms cover all aspects of       
farming. There are arable, dairy and   
mixed arable and dairy farms. Milking  
herds are mostly Freisian,  and one    
or two farms have sheep as well as     
cattle.                                
There are cash crops of potatoes ,     
barley, wheat roots and rape. A large  
proportion of the farms are rented     
from either the Church Commission,     
or an Estate and pass on from          
generation to generation.              
Farms are now largely mechanised, and  
are worked by the farmer and his       
family, with very little hired labour. 
There is an Agricultural Contractor    
in the area, and the farmers who do not
own large specialised equipment, use   
his services.
