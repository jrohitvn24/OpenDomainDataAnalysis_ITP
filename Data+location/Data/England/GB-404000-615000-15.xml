		<title>15The Harvest Festival</title>
		<content> On Sunday I was feeling very excited  
 because it was the Harvest Festival at
 Ingram Church. But in another way I   
 felt sad because it was Canon Hay's   
 last service. He was retiring.        
 When I went into the church it was    
 packed. I could smell the fruit and   
 vegetables and I could see all our    
 brightly coloured Harvest pictures up 
 on the stone walls. I put on my choir 
 robe. We had about three hymns. Then  
 the children from our school came out 
 to the front. We sang Stand Up Clap   
 Hands Shout Thankyou Lordand said     
 Harvest Poems. The little ones sang   
 Oats and Beans and Barley Grow. We    
 walked slowly back to our places.     
 After the service everyone went into  
 the hall. The tea was spread out on   
 long tables.  We gave gifts to Canon  
 Hay.                                  
                                       </content>
