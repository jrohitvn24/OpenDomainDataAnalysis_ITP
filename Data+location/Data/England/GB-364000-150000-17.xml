		<content> Farming is quite a common job in the  
 countryside. The farms in             
 Stratton-on-the-Fosse and Chilcompton 
 are mainly dairy farms. The cows are  
 milked twice every day  at about 0600 
 and 1600. They are taken into a       
 milking parlour where they are milked 
 by machine. The most modern parlour   
 is a rotary one. About 8 cows stand on
 a revolving platform and can be milked
 at once. They must be fed properly so 
 that they can give fresh milk. The    
 milk is stored in a refrigerated tank 
 until it is collected by milk tanker  
 lorry. The tanker calls every day.    
 Wheat, barley, potatoes and oil seed  
 rape are the main crops grown in this 
 area. Wheat is used for making bread, 
 barley is used for making beer and oil
 seed rape is used for margarine.
