		<title>15Coaley - Village Activities</title>
		<content>  Although only a small village, Coaley
 has clubs and activities for all ages.
  There is a clinic where a nurse sees 
 new babies and gives injections       
 against Whooping Cough, Measles and   
 Tetanus and vaccination against Polio.
  The Mother and Toddler group and     
 Playgroup meet each week and are a    
 means by which mothers can talk       
 together while the children play.     
  Girls meet weekly for Brownies where 
 they make things, work for badges and 
 play games.                           
  Some ladies meet for the Women's     
 Institute while others meet to play   
 badminton.                            
  At the church another group meets to 
 ring bells on Sundays and other       
 special occasions. The church also has
 a lively choir and a Sunday School.   
  The school is well supported by a    
 group of fund-raising parents.        </content>
