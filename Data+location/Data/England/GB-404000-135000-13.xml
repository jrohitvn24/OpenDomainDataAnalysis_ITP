 prepare the children's breakfast and  
 my husband's, who comes in at         
 7.30am.At 7.30am I call the children  
 and then serve breakfast.After        
 breakfast I go outside to feed the    
 goats and milk them.After milking I   
 tether the goats.                     
   At 8.45am we leave for school.It is 
 a five minute journey by car.From

 After this I may garden,knit or make  
 corn-dollies.Following this I do some 
 cooking and have lunch.

 the three children to bed after which 
 I bring the goats in.From 8.45pm to
