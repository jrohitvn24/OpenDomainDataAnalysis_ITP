		<content>{TOM LONG'S POST}is a sign post on     
 Minchinhampton Common at a junction   
 where many roads meet:from Stroud;    
 Nailsworth;Amberley;Minchinhampton;   
 Cirencester and Brimscombe.The site   
 is said to be where some highwaymen   
 committed suicide to avoid capture.   
 All roads are unfenced causing danger 
 for traffic from grazing and wandering
 beasts.                               
{EARLY HIGHWAY}- the first evidence of 
 a road is a report of a highway       
 robbery in 1371.The road from Stroud  
 to Cirencester was turnpiked in 1752  
 at Minchinhampton with  a toll gate at
 the site of the present Blue Boys     
 Dairy. The stage coaches used the road
 to travel to Cirencester and London   
 but when the Stroud to Cirencester    
 road (A 419) was built in the         
 Brimscombe valley traffic grew much   
 less.                                 </content>
