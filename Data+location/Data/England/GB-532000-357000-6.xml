		<content> On Saturday my  Dad wakes up at       
 6 o'clock. He goes to work at 7       
 o'clock. Just before he goes he wakes 
 my mum up at 6.45am and she  puts her 
 washing machine on. Gary my brother   
 gets up at 8 0'clock and puts the     
 video on so that wakes me up.I was    
 going to Sally's for the morning so I 
 caught the 10 0'clock bus to Horbling 
 Lane. She waited for me at the top of 
 the lane .When we got to her house we 
 played records and played on her      
 organ. At 2 0'clock my Dad came and   
 collected us both to go to Skegness.  
 When we got there it was snowing so we
 came home came again. Dad took Sally  
 home and I watched television until I 
 went to bed at 10 o'clock.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
