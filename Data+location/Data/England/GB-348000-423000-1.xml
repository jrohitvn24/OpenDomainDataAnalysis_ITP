		<title>01POPULATION OF LONGTON AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
       This area is  basically three   
 villages set in pasture and arable    
 land.                                 
{       Longton}is the oldest village  
 and is the local shopping centre for  
{New Longton}and{Walmer Bridge.}The    
 former grew round the railway station 
 which is now closed,the buildings     
 dismantled,and the whole of the       
 track lifted.{Longton}is a perpetual  
 village which, apart from growing to a
 population of approximately 6000,     
 has remained basically a community    
 which fends for itself. There are no  
 commercial leisure facilities since   
 the villagers organise their own      
 spare time activities.                
       Most people work in Preston     
  or Leyland, but some travel as far as
 Manchester or Liverpool(30 miles).
