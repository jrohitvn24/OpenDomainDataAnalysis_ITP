		<content> Our class took some sheets home. They 
 had on them some questions about our  
 families and the jobs our parents do. 
             {Mum's job                
 There are more housewives than        
 cleaners. There are six housewives    
 and five cleaners. There aren't any   
 mums who work out of doors.           
             {Dad's job                
 More dad's jobs are outside than      
 inside. A lot of the outside jobs are 
 on farms and the inside jobs are in   
 factories. There are ten dads who work
 out of doors and nine who work        
 indoors. Two examples of indoor jobs  
 are teacher and mill operator.        
          {Children's ages}            
 In our class fifteen pupils are eight 
 years old and five are nine years old.
 The youngest child in our families is 
 two months old and the oldest is      
 sixteen years old.                    </content>
