		<content> Most housewives consider an electric  
 cooker, a 'fridge, a washing machine, 
 a colour television and a transistor  
 radio virtually essential and many    
 would be happy with central heating.  
 The installation of this in an old,   
 thick-walled flint cottage is not easy
 and the expense together with the     
 running costs is discouraging.        
 Stanhoe has no gas supply.  A few     
 households have micro-wave cookers but
 in general these are thought          
 unnecessary luxuries as are dish      
 washers.  Freezers however, are common
 especially in the larger families, and
 surplus garden produce and self-picked
 fruit tends to fill them rather than  
 commercial products.  For             
 entertainment, several families have  
 video recorders but the majority      
 prefer television in the evening.     
 Most children have lots of toys.      </content>
