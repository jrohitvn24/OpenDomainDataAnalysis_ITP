		<title>18LOCAL SADDLEWORTH DIALECT</title>
		<content> Saddleworth is a Yorkshire parish with
 a Lancashire population, so is a      
 'mongrel' sort of parish! It is said  
 to be strongly Yorkshire in customs,  
 but the dialect is definitely strongly
 Lancashire, with much local 'slang'.  
 Yorkshire &amp; Lancashire writers have   
 over the years been inspired by       
 similar things &amp; have striven to      
 express them in the same way, but     
 local terms abound. H. B. Whitehead,  
 who was born in Diggle in 1890, has   
 written several poems about the area, 
 &amp; also wrote 'Song of the Cenotaph'   
 for the unveiling of the War Memorial 
 at Pots &amp; Pans in 1923.               
 Typical local expressions include:    
 'He's bitten off more nur he con chew'
 if in difficulty; an avaricious person
 wants 'boath the hawpenny an' the     
 gingerbread'; &amp; 'it never rains but it
 pours' describes something excessive. </content>
