		<content> A walk along Glaston Road in early    
 October 1985 revealed features not    
 apparent on a map. Three tracks lead  
 north from the road; one is           
 unsignposted but perhaps leads tp     
 Launde Farm, the second leads to      
 Welland Vale Nursery, which has a     
 large new greenhouse near the road,   
 and the last has a small rough sign to
 'Millhouse and cottages'.             
 There is an interesting hedge on the  
 north side of the road, near the      
 by_pass junction. This contains ash,  
 field maple, elder, sycamore, elm,    
 black bryony, woody nightshade,       
 bindweed and bramble. The elm is      
 interesting as the author of the{Flora
{of Rutland,}Guy Messenger, has        
 recently written to{The Times}        
 suggesting that regularly cut elm may 
 be resistant to Dutch Elm Disease.
