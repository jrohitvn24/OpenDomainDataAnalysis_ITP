		<content>   Shawforth Drum Majorettes were      
 started in 1981. Local sponsors and   
 fund raisers helped them to buy their 
 own coach to transport the children to
 carnivals, and provided them with     
 their red and white majorette outfits 
 and musical instruments.              
                                       
   Almost all the children live        
 locally. Ages range from approximately
 6 years old to teen-agers. Rehearsals 
 are held in local schools or out of   
 doors in good weather. The majorettes 
 have a full time-table, are to be seen
 at local galas and have given displays
 at other venues around the North West,
 including Pontin's Holiday Centres.   
                                       
   An enthusiastic group of parents act
 as trainers and supporters.
