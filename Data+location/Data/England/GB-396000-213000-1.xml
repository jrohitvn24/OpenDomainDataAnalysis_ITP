		<title>01A Cotswold Idyll</title>
		<content> The{Cowley area}in Gloucestershire    
 lies in the undulating oolitic        
 limestone Cotswold Hills which rise to
 270 metres above sea level.           
 Predominantly rural in character, the 
 area supports mostly arable farming.  
 Walks around the area are popular with
 tourists and two local inns provide   
 attractive resting places. Wild life  
 can be easily encountered particularly
 pheasant, rabbits and magpies and     
 sometimes deer, foxes and badgers.    
 The villages are mostly dormitory     
 settlements for the nearby towns of   
 Cheltenham and Cirencester, although a
 small nucleus of people still work on 
 the land. There is quite a high       
 proportion of indigenous retired      
 people. Cowley Manor, Churnside Camp  
 and the Guide HQ draw visitors, many  
 of them young people, into the area   
 and attest to its natural beauty.     </content>
