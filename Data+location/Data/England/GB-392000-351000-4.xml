		<content>   The structure used is made up of    
about twelve panels.Locally dug clay is
chopped into small pieces then it is   
"puddled".The puddlers tread the clay, 
mixed with water.The panel boards are  
soaked in water then the clay is spread
on to the panels to a thickness of two 
centimetres and smoothed over.The      
designer prepares a picture revolving  
around the theme he wishes to present. 
(1985-The 150th.Anniversary of the     
introduction of Methodism into Endon). 
The outlines of the design are sketched
on to the surface and beech cones are  
used to mark them.Moss,tree bark,lichen
and coloured grit are used in the      
design,together with numerous flower   
heads.These materials are embedded in  
the clay to complete the picture.The   
finished product has to be sprayed with
water frequently to keep the flowers   
fresh.                                 </content>
