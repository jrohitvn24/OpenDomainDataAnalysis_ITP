		<title>19Traffic in Lyndhurst</title>
		<content> The current concern amongst the       
 residents living south of Lyndhurst,  
 is the problem caused by traffic.     
 There are two busy roads leading      
 southwards out of Lyndhurst towards   
 the New Forest.   These pass through  
 an attractive residential area.   The 
 majority of people living there are of
 an older generation and appreciate the
 peaceful atmosphere.   Therefore, in  
 summer when Lyndhurst becomes a       
 tourist attraction the traffic        
 disturbs their peace.   Lyndhurst's   
 narrow roads are not designed for     
 heavy traffic which tourists cause.   
 The residents have been awaiting plans
 for a proposed by-pass, to control    
 this increasing problem.  However,    
 opposing this suggested solution is   
 the argument of the Forestry          
 Commission, saying that to implement  
 these plans would ruin the landscape. </content>
