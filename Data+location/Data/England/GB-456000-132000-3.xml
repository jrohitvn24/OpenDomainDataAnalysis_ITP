		<title>03ALRESFORD WATERCRESS GROWING</title>
		<content>    {Watercress}has grown wild in the  
 area for hundreds of years,but it was 
 the railway opening in 1865 that      
 opened up the industry.The perishable 
 cress could be taken to the station in
 the afternoon and be on sale at Covent
 Garden in the early hours.            
     It takes about 5 or 6 weeks for   
 the cress to grow.The process is      
 labour intensive as it is picked and  
 bunched by hand.They must pick the    
 cress before it flowers and goes      
 yellow.                               
     The cress 'beds' are constructed  
 of concrete and in general fed by bore
 holes in the Chalk which deliver the  
 water at a constant 10 degrees C.The  
 water is kept running through the beds
 and grids etc. at the higher end keep 
 out most fish,sticks and things which 
 may damage the cress.It is sold at the
 'beds' for about 18p. a bunch.        </content>
