The agriculture carried on in this     
block is almost entirely arable        
farming.Barley predominates but wheat  
also is grown.Sugar beet is also a very
important crop and this is harvested   
and transported to the refinery in     
nearby Bury St Edmunds in strict       
rotation.It must be delivered on the   
day stipulated and if it is not then   
that particular delivery is missed and 
must wait,rather than interrupt        
subsequent deliveries.                 
     Of late,oil seed rape is of       
considerable importance to the cooking 
oil and "margarine" industry,and the   
fields are yellow during flowering     
time.This is often confused with       
previous yellow fields which were then 
mustard flower.Apart from these        
crops,little else was found.
