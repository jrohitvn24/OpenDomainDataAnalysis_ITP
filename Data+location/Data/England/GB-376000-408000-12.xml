		<title>12Ainsworth Isolation Hospital</title>
		<content>{Ainsworth Isolation Hospital}was built
 in 1906 and was last used to treat{   
{small pox}in 1966.In 1984 Bury        
 Community Health Council wanted the   
 hospital used for the younger         
 chronically sick,but the Regional     
 Health Authority wanted to sell the   
 hospital so that other hospitals in   
 the area,such as{Fairfield}and{Bury   
{General}could be developed.           
 In January 1972 the home for the      
 nurses at the hospital,{Paddock Leach,
 was demolished by being deliberately  
 burnt down.This was done to prevent   
 infection during the demolition.      
 Paddock Leach,which dates back to the 
 18th century,was at one time a        
 combined farmhouse and collective     
{weaving}shed.The top storey housed the
 hand looms.
