		<title>19No Sports Hall for Us</title>
		<content> People in New Mills are concerned that
 we have not got a Sports Hall.        
 Recently there has been a petition for
 the Sports Hall to be built.If we     
 still had a carnival maybe we would be
 able to raise enough money to build   
 such a structure for public use.Next  
 to the swimming pool and squash courts
 they have built a clinic and left a   
 space for the Sports Hall. The        
 council do not want the Sports Hall   
 because  the council is from all over 
 the High Peak and they are more       
 concerned with Buxton and other       
 places.New Mills has got a Youth      
 Centre.The Youth Club has got Table   
 Tennis, Pool, Football, Netball,      
 Weightlifting,etc.The Youth Centre    
 is keeping teenages out of trouble and
 off the streets.The Sports Hall would 
 help more of them to keep out of      
 trouble.                              </content>
