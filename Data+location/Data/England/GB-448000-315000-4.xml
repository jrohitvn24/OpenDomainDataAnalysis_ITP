		<title>04TREE CONSERVATION IN L'BORO</title>
		<content> The Outwoods is a popular area of     
 recreation just a few miles from      
 Loughborough town centre.  It is a    
 mixed wood with much plant and animal 
 life, including a nature trail, foot  
 paths and bridle paths.               
   During the past year there has been 
 a large conservation programme. Seven 
 acres of land have been planted with  
 young trees.  Many of the local groups
 have helped plant the trees. The local
 cub pack planted trees on May 2,l985. 
   On Thursday 27 June Loughborough had
 a Royal visit from Princess Diana and 
 Prince Charles. Prince Charles had    
 been invited as Patron of The Men of  
 the Trees to plant the 10,000th tree. 
 It was an exciting day: six people    
 from our school were invited. Prince  
 Charles planted an oak tree.          
 We hope the new plantation will       
 provide much pleasure in the future.  </content>
