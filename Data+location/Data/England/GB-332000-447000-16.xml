		<title>16ST OSWALD'S PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content>   St Oswald's Church is 86 years old  
 and there has been a parish church in 
 Knott End since 1899. The present     
 Vicar, Mr Bob Jackson, has lived in   
 Knott End for 16 years and now he, his
 wife and youngest daughter live in the
 vicarage. In an interview he said that
 most of the church-goers are elderly, 
 mainly because so many retired people 
 live in the village. The oldest church
 member is 96. There are 10 group      
 activities at St Oswald's and his     
 favourites are the youth group and the
 choir. In his years at St Oswald's    
 only 3 young people have approached   
 him because they want to serve God as 
 ministers, but more people come to    
 church now than did two years ago; 300
 people come to the church each week.  
 He is happy because he feels needed by
 the people but would like to see more 
 care and concern shared by churches.  </content>
