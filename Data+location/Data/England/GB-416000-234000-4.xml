		<title>04Baby clinic</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 1st. May we interveiwed  
 Miss Kellard about the baby clinic.The
 baby clinic is a place where babies go
 to have thier weight checked and have 
 thier injections .To be a health      
 visitor you need to be a qualified    
 nurse and do a special course.        
        The health visitor that comes  
 to Blockley prefers small villages to 
 large towns.                          
        The baby clinic has been       
 running for 11 years, but before the  
 war there was an infant welfare       
 clinic.If a baby was ill at clinic    
 Miss Kellard would send it to a local 
 doctor or hospital if needed.         
         The clinic is held at the St. 
 Georges Hall, Blockley once per month.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
