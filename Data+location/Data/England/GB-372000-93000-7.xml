		<content> For a place as small as{PUDDLETOWN}   
 there are a considerable number of    
 shops and services.                   
     There are two village stores.They 
 sell just about everything from       
 foodstuffs and other household items  
 to toys,alcohol and cigarettes.They   
 attempt to attract local custom by    
 offering weekly bargains but they have
 great difficulty in competing with the
 larger shops in{DORCHESTER,BLANDFORD  
 and{POOLE}where most weekly shopping  
 is done.A mobile shop tours the       
 local area supplying small villages   
 and farmsteads.                       
     Other shops in the village include
 a{butchers,clothes shop,hairdressers  
{and a post office.}This shop offers   
 the usual postal services plus sweets,
 drinks,cards and so on.There are two  
 postal colections and two deliveries  
 on weekdays and one on Saturdays.     </content>
