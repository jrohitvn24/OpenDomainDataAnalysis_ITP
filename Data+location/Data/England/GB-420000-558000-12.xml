		<title>12Travel to Work</title>
		<content>   Unlike commuters in some parts of   
 Britain workers living in our block   
 enjoy easy access to their place of   
 work and this is also reflected in    
 their choice of transport.  With good 
 roads and public transport it may seem
 odd that the tradition of living close
 by the work place persists.           
   Half our sample work less than 2    
 m from home;22% travel up to 3        
 m into Gateshead;only 16% travel 5    
 m into Newcastle and a mere 4%        
 travel either up to 12 m within       
 Tyneside or up to 20 m beyond.        
   Travel to work on foot is common    
 (29%) particularly among those in     
 Lobley Hill working on nearby Team    
 Valley Estate. Almost equal numbers   
 use bus and car (35%), though car use 
 in Whickham is more common (50%).
