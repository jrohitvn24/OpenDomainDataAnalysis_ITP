		<content> THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF {FOOD}TODAY    
 .CHEESE CAKE IS ONE OF THE NICEST     
 DESSERTS.IT IS MADE OF A CREAMY CHEESE
 FLAVOUR WITH SHORT CAKE AT THE        
 BOTTOM.ANOTHER NICE FOOD IS FISH AND  
 CHIPS.{FISH}IS USUALLY DONE IN BREAD  
 CRUMBS OR BATTER.YOU CAN BUY FISH FROM
 EITHER NORMAL SHOPS AND COOK THEM AT  
 HOME OR A FISH AND CHIP SHOP WHICH HAS
 THEM COOKED ALREADY.                  
    CHIPS ARE MADE OUT OF {POTATOES}   
 .THE POTATOE IS SLICED INTO RECTANGLES
 TO MAKE THE SHAPE OF THE CHIPS.       
    THOSE ARE THREE OF MY FAVOURITE    
 FOODS.
