{What jobs were there in Ravenfield    
{before the war?                       
 There were two jobs, either the men   
 were miners or they were agricultural 
 workers on the farm.                  
{Were there any"characters"in R.field? 
 "Ravenfield Jack" kept the only shop  
 in the old village and sold beer. He  
 had a superb collection of coins. Men 
 used to come to the shop buy a bottle 
 of beer then go to an old shed to     
 drink it and smoke a pipe.            
{What shops were there?                
 There were very few shops. There was  
 old Jack's, and a fish &amp; chip shop at 
 the Common. Opposite the "Cavalier"   
 public house was a general store. Down
 Braithwell road was a wooden building,
 selling everything from screws to     
 food.
