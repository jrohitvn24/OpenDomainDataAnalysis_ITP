		<title>19Heskin Old Hall Farm</title>
		<content>     Built about 1800, of stone        
recovered from the burnt-out Old Hall, 
the farm has belonged to the Cooper    
family for three generations.          
     The farm covers 200 acres, and    
wheat and barley are grown on the whole
of it. The farm is fully mechanised, so
the farmer does not employ any workers,
depending on the other three members of
his family to help out. All the grain  
produced is fed to their 10,000 battery
hens. The eggs are graded for size and 
packed on the farm before being sold.  
     The very old crook barn houses 27 
tractors. Five are used on the farm;   
the rest are vintage models, forming a 
collection which the farmer hopes to   
restore.                               
     A few pigs are kept, but not as a 
commercial venture.
