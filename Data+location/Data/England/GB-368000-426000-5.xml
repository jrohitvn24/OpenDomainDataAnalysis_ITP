		<title>05SEATON COURT</title>
		<content>   In Blackburn there are quite a few  
 old people's homes, but we have chosen
{Seaton Court}on the Roman Road        
 estate to write about. This is a      
 council-owned protected dwelling and  
 the thirty-seven occupants are between
 the ages of 65-90 years old.          
   Every morning the warden goes around
 to see if the old people are well. Any
 ill people are sent to a nursing home 
 where they will be looked after.      
 Shopping and looking after their rooms
 are just some ways the people occupy  
 themselves. Concerts are held and     
 there are outings anywhere in Britain.
 The warden and the cleaner organize   
 these entertainments.                 
   Because of the helpful staff, the   
 old people are kept very happy and    
 comfortable and it is the sort of     
 place that we would like to live in   
 when we are old.                      </content>
