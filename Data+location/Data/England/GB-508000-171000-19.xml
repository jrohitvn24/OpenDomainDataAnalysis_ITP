		<content> The clothes of today are very         
 different from what our parents used  
 to wear. People are now far more      
 fashion conscious than they used to be
 and people tend to associate with one 
 trend or another. The following is    
 a list of styles that young people in 
 our local area are wearing today;mods,
 casuals, rockers, punks and futurists.
 Mods began in the 1950's but there are
 still many people who follow this     
 fashion and ride scooters (the        
 standard Mod form of transport).      
 Casuals wear modern designer clothes  
 that are very expensive to buy and    
 which come in and out of fashion very 
 quickly. These clothes are easily     
 identified by the makers emblem or    
 label that is clearly visible on      
 shirts,jumpers and trousers.
