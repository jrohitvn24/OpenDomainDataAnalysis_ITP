		<title>08HITCHIN BY-PASS (2)</title>
		<content>   However, the planning and building  
 of this Relief road proved to be very 
 controversial.A By_pass for Hitchin   
 had been talked about way back in the 
 1920's and although central government
 agreed to such a road as long ago as  
 1958, it was not until 1971 that the  
 government approved its location.Since
 then cash cutbacks and doubts about   
 the proposed route resulted in more   
 delays and a public enquiry in Sept   
 1979. Objections ranged from the cost 
 of the scheme, the disappearance of   
 listed buildings, fears of town centre
 road closures resulting in loss of    
 business,the disturbance of old       
 people's homes,fear of subway muggers,
 to the more practical problem of what 
 to do with 70,000 tons of earth!      
  All these problems were finally      
 overcome or partially resolved and the
 By_pass is now well established.      </content>
