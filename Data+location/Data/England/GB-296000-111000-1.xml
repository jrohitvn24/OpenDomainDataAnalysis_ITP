		<title>01EAST OF TIVERTON</title>
		<content>  Our Domesday Block is situated in the
{County of Devon,}containing the       
 eastern outskirts of{Tiverton,}a town 
 of about 15,000 inhabitants, and open 
 countryside in the{Lowman Valley.     
  There are two{residential suburbs    
 dating generally from the 1960/70's.  
 About half of each estate is devoted  
 to rented{council housing,}the rest   
 consisting of a number of private     
 developments inhabited by             
{owner-occupiers.}                     
  Between the two estates lie the{main 
{road (A.373),}the{old railway line,   
 the{River Lowman}and a small          
{industrial area. }A canal is nearby.  
  Along the south of the block runs a  
 ridge of{hills}rising to about 200    
 metres, overlooking the{flat valley.  
{Farmland}which covers about 3/4 of the
 area is devoted mainly to{grassland   
{for grazing.                          </content>
