		<title>10Linceter Today(Brockhampton</title>
		<content> Linceter Farm was built about 1839    
 it is a brick house witha slate roof  
 and is built on an old foundation     
 situated on Badley Wood Common.My     
 Great Grandfather came aa a tenant to 
 Linceter Farm in 1903.                
 Many changes have taken place since   
 those days,such as combining in stead 
 of threshing,silaging in place of hay 
 making,potatoe harvester for harvest- 
 ing potatoes,hedge trimmer instead of 
 hedge bills.                          
  My Father sells his animals in       
 Worcester and Hereford market and     
 usually buys them from the same       
 market.                               
  Most groceries Mum buys in Bromyard  
 but clothes and and household goods   
 she buys in Kidderminster,she stores  
 much of this food in the freezer.     
  I travel to school by bus,Mum takes  
 me to the bus stop by car.            </content>
