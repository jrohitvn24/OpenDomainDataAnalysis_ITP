		<title>16CLUBS FOR CHILDREN</title>
		<content> Lots of our children go to the        
 Creswell Division of the Saint John's 
 Ambulance Brigade Cadets to learn     
 first aid.                            
 There are also packs of Cubs and Boy  
 Scouts, Brownies and Girl Guides.     
 For children who are good at sports   
 there are lots of different clubs to  
 join. Karl plays for a local football 
 team at the weekends. Lee goes to the 
 Judo Club at the church rooms to learn
 about the martial arts. Peter goes to 
 the Speedo Swimming Club at Creswell  
 Baths. Here the children improve their
 swimming strokes so that they can     
 enter competitions. Rhonda is such a  
 good swimmer now that she enters races
 all over the country.                 
 At Creswell Baths there are also      
 swimming classes for toddlers, mothers
 and old age pensioners as well as     
 children.                             </content>
