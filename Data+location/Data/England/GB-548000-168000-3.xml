		<content>  Although orginally a small town,with 
only one shopping area,as Swanley's    
housing development grew,so did the    
needs of the people. Phase one of      
Swanley's precinct was begun and it    
consisted of a varied selection of     
small shops,plus a bank,doctors surgery
,Woolworths,Boots,the Co-op and        
International.                         
  Phase two mainly consisted of an Asda
superstore.This provides a wide range  
of goods.                              
  Eventually phase three will begin,but
we don't know what it consists of      
because construction has been delayed. 
  Wednesday is Market day.It is popular
,but many people would like more       
produce stalls.                        
  We conducted a survey and most       
residents seemed satisfied with        
Swanley's shopping facilties,but many  
women wanted more clothes,shoe shops.  </content>
