		<content> The old school only had two           
 classrooms, so one class had to work  
 in the village hall, which was about  
 200 yards away. We had to move into a 
 new school because there was not      
 enough room in the old one for every  
 one to fit in and apart from that it  
 was very damp and the walls were      
 rotting. In the winter it was very    
 cold in the village hall, so that     
 sometimes we had to keep our coats on 
 all day. The new school opened in     
 October 1984. There are three classes 
 working in large,bright,colourful     
 classes. There are four teachers and a
 secretary. There is a very large hall 
 with a music area and P.E. equipment. 
 Pupils transfer at the age of eleven  
 to the nearby Comprehensive School at 
 Barlby.There is a play group for under
 fives supervised by parents in the    
 Village Hall.                         </content>
