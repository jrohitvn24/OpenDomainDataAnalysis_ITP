		<content>   Although there are many older       
 buildings in this area, most of the   
 modern building took place in the     
 196Os between Kirklington Road and    
 Lower Kirklington Road.  Then it went 
 to the other side of the latter road  
 towards the River Greet in the 197Os. 
 The current building estates are on   
 the Newark Road (a continuation of    
 Lower Kirklington Road). Around this  
 area flooding can occur from the      
 river.                                
   Development towards Halam was halted
 by Norwood Park and other land owned  
 by Lord Starkey.  In Station Road and 
 Dover Street and the surrounding area,
 the houses are older and include some 
 terrace houses built around the turn  
 of the century.
