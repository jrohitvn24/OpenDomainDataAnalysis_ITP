		<title>05LLOYDS BANK</title>
		<content>   The sub_manager of Lloyds bank who  
 we interviewed was called Mike Lee. He
 had worked at Lloyds bank for 6 years 
   He was unable to tell us how much   
 money that the bank had in its vaults 
 for security reasons. There were 28   
 people working there, only 9 of which 
 were men. The staff work in shifts    
 from 9.30am_3.30pm.                   
   He said that the busiest day of the 
 week was Friday and the busiest time  
 of year was Christmas and the end of  
 the year. He said that the minimum age
 for a worker there was 16.            
   Cars, Home Improvements and weddings
 are the things Personal Loans are used
 for most.                             
   The bank has been raided 2 times and
 there are security alarms, but he     
 couldn't tell us any more than that.
