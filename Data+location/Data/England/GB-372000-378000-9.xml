		<content>   Elizabeth Gaskell first came to     
 Knutsford in November 1811 when she   
 was a year old.  Her name was         
 Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson until she
 married and became Mrs. Gaskell.      
   Elizabeth was married in 1832 at    
 Knutsford Parish Church.  She had four
 children, all girls, but it was after 
 the death of baby son, William, that  
 she started writing books.            
   These included 'Mary Barton',       
 'Cranford','North and South' and      
 'Wives and Daughters'. Cranford was   
 based on her experiences of Knutsford.
   The house where she lived,          
 Heathside, overlooks Little Heath.    
   Elizabeth died at 55 and was buried 
 in the churchyard of Brook Street     
 Chapel.
