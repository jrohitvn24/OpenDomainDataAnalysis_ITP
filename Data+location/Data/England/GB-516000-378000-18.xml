		<title>18TRANSPORT IN PANTON</title>
		<content> Transport in {PANTON}is very poor. The
 only public transport is that which is
 provided for the children to go to    
 school either in Louth or East        
 Barkwith. A school bus arrives every  
 morning at just after eight o'clock at
 Warren House and collects the local   
 children for Louth. The bus is a 53   
 seater bus owned by Appleby's. It     
 picks up a full load of children on   
 its journey to Louth which takes about
 45 minutes. For the younger children a
 local private taxi calls at various   
 points to collect the four children   
 who attend East Barkwith Primary      
 school. There is no other form of     
 public transport and residents are    
 wholly reliant on their own cars or   
 bicycles.
