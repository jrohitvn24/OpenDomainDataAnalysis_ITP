		<content>{Wildlife:}The people we interviewed}  
 spoke highly of the area they lived   
 in. The land was good for walking and 
 rambling, and a group of the boys had 
 undertaken a survey of the wildlife   
 and birdlife that they saw whilst they
 were in the area. Squirrels, foxes,   
 deer, a kestrel and a whole host of   
 different types of birds were seen.   
{Pollution:}The Leeds-Liverpool Canal{ 
 runs through the village, and near the
 canal they saw a mallard duck and     
 ducklings but significantly they did  
 see some dead fish, and it is wondered
 in the village itself whether the     
 canal is being polluted from the      
 quarry at the top of the Hill.
