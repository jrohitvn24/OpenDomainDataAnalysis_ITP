		<title>02Farming around Baker Street</title>
		<content> There are three farms in this area,   
 namely Hoblets Farm, Poplar Farm and  
 Whitefields Farm. They are owned by   
 one family who live outside the area. 
     The fen land in the area was once 
 common land used for grazing but      
 during the war it was ploughed up to  
 produce food as part of the war       
 effort.                               
     The intention was that the fen    
 would revert back to common land, but 
 this never happened. Gradually dairy  
 farming was phased out in favour of   
 arable crops.                         
    The small council estate in this   
 area was once an orchard.             
     There is still some rough grazing 
 land to be seen around the Baker      
 Street area and Hoblets Farm has a    
 pheasant hatchery.
