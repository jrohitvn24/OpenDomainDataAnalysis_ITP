		<title>03The Grantham Canal-Kinoulton</title>
		<content>      The {Grantham Canal}is 33 miles  
 long.The canal itself is a very       
 peaceful and quiet place.Every day    
 many people go walking along its      
 banks.There are lots of{Wild Flowers} 
 growing e.g. cowslips,hop trefoil     
 tufted vetch,red campion and          
 bird's-foot trefoil which many people 
 call 'eggs and bacon'.Hovering around 
 the hedges there are lots of blue     
 dragonflies and colourful butterflies.
      In the summer people see Mallard 
 ducks,moorhens and swans with their   
 young.Also there are goats grazing on 
 the banks.In winter the canal some-   
 times freezes over and people skate on
 it.                                   
      Many years ago the canal was a   
 busy place and{barges}would sail up   
 and down carrying many goods to the   
 village.Now the noise and bustle of { 
{barges}are just memories.             </content>
