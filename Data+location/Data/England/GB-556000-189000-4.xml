		<title>04STREAMS (2): WARLEY, ESSEX</title>
		<content>   An attempt was made in mid June to  
 measure the channel and flow          
 characteristics of the streams in the 
 area, but there were difficulties. The
{Weald Brook,}the most sizeable stream,
 has cut down about 2m. below its      
 nettle-strewn banks, and its bed is   
 very soft. Access and measurement were
 thus difficult. At points where access
 was possible, e.g. the bridge at      
 559915,{rubbish}had been liberally    
 tipped into it making measurements    
 meaningless and hazardous. The other  
 streams were mostly reduced to        
{trickles}or stagnant pools at this    
 time of year. Elsewhere they had been 
 straightened and confined to concrete 
 channels: there was no point in       
 measuring them.{Weeds and plant}growth
 were common in the channels, reflect- 
 ing wide-scale application of         
 fertiliser to the surrounding fields. </content>
