		<content> One of the team working on the        
 defences against the sea describes    
 some of his work.  Cockle Path - a    
 short cut to the sea - was in a poor  
 condition.  We built up 140 yards of  
 the path by humping mud.  We          
 re-planted vegetation for 400 yards by
 digging up marshes and carting the    
 vegetation by raft to its new home.   
 We placed plastic net wire on top of  
 this to give it a base to cling to.   
 Nearer the sea we bulldozed a pathway 
 through the hills and made a wooden   
 walkway.  Still using the bulldozer we
 strengthened nearby dunes before      
 transplanting marram grass.  This has 
 taken hold well and loose sand blown  
 off the beach has gathered on the     
 dunes to provide more resistance.     
 Back on the Staithe we put down rubble
 and fabric to form a hard area for    
 cars and trailers and launching boats.</content>
