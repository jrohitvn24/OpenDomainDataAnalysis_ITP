		<content> Mr.Duffield built an{indoor riding    
{school}in 1981 for the winter months  
 for his children to ride.Mr.Creaton,  
 the manager,told us how it grew       
 bigger.                               
  There are twenty stables that they   
 use in winter and there are about     
 thirty horses which they use but some 
 people bring their own.               
 In summer they have most of their     
 lessons outside,but in winter they    
 always have them inside.              
  They are hoping that in the future   
 they will have two or three day       
 shows.People travel miles and miles to
 come,some from Wales,Scotland and the 
 other side of London.People come to   
 them to do their{British Horse Society
{Award}which is a twelve month         
 course.This Summer they will prepare  
 a team for the{Horse of the Year Show.
