		<title>04BELVEDERE by the Wind.</title>
		<content>  Now it's Autumn and I'm looking      
 forward to blowing through Belvedere. 
 I look, and should be above my        
 favourite spot by now, but it's not   
 there. Instead, are just rows of      
 houses. The old sea-mens' home's land 
 is a new estate where children ride on
 bikes making lots of noise and add to 
 the traffic commotion, although the   
 people don't seem to notice it. I pass
 through the village where the shops   
 are swapped around. I'm getting lost. 
 There are so many people about, it's  
 not at all like thirty years ago.     
  Where should I go? I wonder. Then I  
 remember the doctors' beautiful       
 gardens, surely they must still be    
 there. But they're not, instead there 
 are houses. Feeling very disillutioned
 with what has met my gaze, I blow     
 away, to return perhaps another day.  
 Will there be any changes? WHO KNOWS! </content>
