		<title>11HOMOEOPATHY - WALL.</title>
		<content>  Living in "Madeley Cottage" Wall Lane
is a gentleman who is a practitioner in
Homoeopathic medicine. He is a         
director  of "The Centre for           
Alternative Therapy" Rugeley.          
  Homoeopathy is based on the law of   
similars. The word itself comes from   
the Greek-Homion meaning "Similar" and 
Pathos meaning "Disease". The Law of   
Similars means that a remedy which     
creates symptoms and conditions in a   
healthy person will cure a sick person 
manifesting similar symptoms.          
  Homoeopathy is based on the principle
that "like cures like"; homoeopaths    
believe that a sick person's symptoms  
are a sign of the body's battle        
against illness and they try to        
stimulate, rather than suppress this   
reaction.                              
  Health foods are also proving to be  
much in demand at his shop in Rugeley. </content>
