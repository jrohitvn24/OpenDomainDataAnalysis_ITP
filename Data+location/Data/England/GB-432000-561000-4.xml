		<content>    Only 10% of people in our area live
 close enough to shops or work to      
 travel on foot. Although many own     
 cars, more than 50% still rely on the 
 public transport system. This system  
 is an integrated one, relying on bus  
 services to the local{Metro           
{Interchange.}                         
    The{Metro,}which opened in 1982,   
 provides a rapid and cheap way of     
 travel by rail to many parts of{Tyne  
{and Wear.}                            
    Difficulty of parking in shopping  
 centres, has resulted in 50% of car   
 owners preferring to use the{Metro. } 
    Another means of travel is by{     
{British Rail.}Trains run from{Boldon  
{Colliery}to{Newcastle and Sunderland. 
    The main roads are the{A1T,}running
 north/south via the{Tyne Tunnel,}and  
 the{A194}running east/west from{South 
{Shields to Newcastle. }               </content>
