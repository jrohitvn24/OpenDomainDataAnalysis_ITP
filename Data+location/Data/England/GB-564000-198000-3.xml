		<content> The block lies just to the north of   
 the southernmost limit of glaciation  
 in the British Isles. Surface deposits
 over much of the area consist of      
 boulder clay and it is only in the    
 north-east of the area that there are 
 more sandy deposits, though still of  
 glacial origin.                       
                                       
 These glacial deposits overlie London 
 clay. London clay may actually be seen
 occasionally in the bed of the River  
 Wid and its tributaries.              
                                       
 The geology of the area is responsible
 for the landscape and the character of
 farming in the block. Crop farming is 
 the typical use of boulder clay lands.
 The sandy deposits in the north-east  
 of the block help explain the greater 
 incidence of woodland and non-arable  
 land.                                 </content>
