		<content> The name Framwellgate Moor comes from 
 the old English and Scandinavian      
 languages.Framwell meaning "a spring" 
 and Gate meaning "a street".The name  
 may mean "the street of the strong    
 spring."                              
 Pity Me comes from the Norman         
 French,"PETIT MER",meaning a small    
 lake and there is evidence to prove   
 that one existed.                     
 In the Boldon book,Framwellgate Moor  
 is described as a hunting ground for  
 the Bishops of Durham.The area was    
 agricultral and contained 18 farms at 
 one time.The main landowners between  
 1809-1838 were Liddell and Russell.   
 In the 19th Century colleries         
 developed.In 1901 a census revealed   
 that there were 5105 people living in 
 the parishes and 1000 men worked at   
 the colleries.
