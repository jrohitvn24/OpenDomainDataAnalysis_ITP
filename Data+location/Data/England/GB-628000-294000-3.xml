		<content> Despite social,economic &amp; agricultural
 changes in the past 30 years,the pace 
 of living in our rural communities    
 still allows time for the minor       
 courtesies:there is a marked friendli-
 ness in all walks of life; native     
 parochialism still expects &amp; receives 
 support at local functions such as the
 School Fete or Flower Show.Inevitably 
 there has been a weakening of this    
 attitude owing to the need to look for
 work beyond the villages.The car makes
 it easy to shop at supermarkets,      
 threatening the village shop.Earlier  
 almost total involvement in farming   
 has given way to regarding the farmers
 as "they",not "us".It is of interest  
 to note the strong attachment in      
 villages to their churches,probably   
 the oldest signs of civilisation;     
 coupled with the burial ground of     
 their forbears they command respect.  </content>
