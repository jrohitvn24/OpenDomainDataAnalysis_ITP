		<content>  Interview with Brian Summers, general
 reporter with Wolverhampton Express   
 and Star. The future of local         
 newspapers, the Express and Star      
 especially.                           
  There is much competition from       
 national and other local newspapers.  
 Also from television, radio,video,and 
 teletext news. The Express and Star   
 covers local interests which others do
 not.                                  
  The paper can be read slowly and read
 more than once. Can be read on the bus
 or train unlike other media. The paper
 is progressive. It is put together by 
 computers, typwriters are no longer   
 used. Stories appear straight onto a  
 computer screen. This is the main     
 change in newspapers. It has caused   
 dispute with print unions over fears  
 for jobs. Main change in West Midlands
 is growth of unemployment.            </content>
