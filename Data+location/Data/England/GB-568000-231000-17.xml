		<content>    Our school was built in Victorian  
 times about 130 years ago.It used to  
 have separate sides for girls and boys
 with even a wall down the middle of   
 the playground.                       
    Nowadays it is divided into three  
 classes by age.There are about seventy
 children who come from the village,   
 Cornish Hall End and a few Americans  
 from the Air Base.                    
    The day starts at 8.45 with a break
 at 10.30 for 15 mins.The dinner hour  
 is from noon to 1.30.Afternoon break  
 is at 2.30 and school ends at 3.30.   
    We do Mathematics and language     
 work.Topic work is also important as  
 we go out on trips to nature reserves,
 museums,archaelogical digs and also   
 many places in the village itself.    
     We go swimming once a week and    
 play football,netball,rounders,gym    
 volleyball and cricket.               </content>
