		<title>06Large Abattoir,near Wootton</title>
		<content>  There is a large abattoir and meat   
processing plant about a mile from     
Wootton. It employs 318 workers and    
some jobs have been lost recently      
after the company was sold.            
   An incredible number of animals are 
slaughtered every week: 580 cattle,    
2000 lambs and 3500 pigs. The animals  
are made drowsy before they are killed.
                                       
  Meat is prepared for the company's   
shops as well as for some supermarket  
chains.The hides, bones and offal are  
also processed in various ways.        
There could be changes in the meat     
trade as many of the public prefer     
leaner meat. The cattle now have to be 
fed differently. There also seems to   
be a trend against meat eating among   
some people.
