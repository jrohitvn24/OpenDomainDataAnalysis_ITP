		<title>12Children's "in words"</title>
		<content>    Children all around the country    
 develop a set of words that they use  
 when with their friends, especially at
 school. We are not sure why they start
 to use the words, perhaps they come   
 from TV characters.                   
    Words used to express approval in  
 this area have been{"that's brill",   
{"ace", "cool",}but the latest         
 favourite is{"mega".}Children accepted
 as "in with the bunch" are{"ace kids" 
 or{"cool dudes".                      
    Children also pick up on sayings   
 they hear from their parents and older
 folk.{"Kids today!"}was often uttered 
 by children when their friends were   
 being silly.{"Don't cry about it"}is a
 reply to anyone complaining about the 
 unfairness of the situation they found
 themselves in.                        
    Names they call each other are less
 suitable for the general public!      </content>
