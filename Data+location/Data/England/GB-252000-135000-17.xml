		<title>17MARWOOD S. A TYPICAL FAMILY</title>
		<content>    There are four in my family, my    
 Mum, Dad, my younger sister Selina and
 myself. We live at Marwood Hill in a  
 cottage that was built in the 15th    
 century as a stable and later         
 converted into a house.               
    My grandparents all live out of    
 Devon in Utterby in Lincolnshire. Both
 my parents are teachers. Dad teaches  
 at Pilton Comprehensive School and Mum
 teaches the infants at Marwood.       
    My family often do a lot of        
 walking in our spare time as we all   
 enjoy it.                             
    We keep chickens and get about 3   
 eggs a day. We have got two fish and a
 rabbit that runs about the garden.    
    My favourite programmes on TV are  
 "Blue Peter","Dallas",Don't Wait Up", 
 "Cover Up" and "Starsky and Hutch".
