		<content> 10-year old children were asked what  
 they hoped to achieve in the future.  
 Most children wanted to own  a  car.  
 The second most popular "dream" was   
 to live in a big house and have lots  
 of money.Other dreams included:       
                                       
    Managing an airport                
    Owning a horse                     
    Owning a trendy shop,              
    Running a computer shop            
    Becoming a Pop singer              
                                       
 Here is a what one person wrote about 
 their dream:                          
                                       
    The thing I would like most is to  
 live on a farm with lots of animals,  
 but most of them would be horses.It   
 would have an indoor riding school.It 
 would be very big and nice.
