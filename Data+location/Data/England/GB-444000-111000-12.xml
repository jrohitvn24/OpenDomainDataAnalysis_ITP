		<content> The opening of the {Bitterne Bypass}, 
 named "Mowbray King Way" was an       
 important event in 1984 in this       
 eastern area of{Southampton}.Through {
{traffic }on the main road from        
 Portsmouth now passes to the north of 
 Bitterne on a dual carriageway.The    
 main street in {Bitterne}is now closed
 to traffic and is,in 1985,in the      
 process  of being converted into a {  
{pedestrian precinct}.Features of the  
 precinct include a {new Church}and{   
{supermarket}.Also opened in 1985 was  
 the {Bitterne Leisure Centre}which    
 includes a multi-use{sports hall}. An 
 adjacent{swimming pool}is due for     
 completion in 1986.Considerable       
 disruption and inconvenience has been 
 caused by this reconstruction in the  
 1980's but it is hoped that {Bitterne 
 will now enjoy better facilities than 
 ever before.                          </content>
