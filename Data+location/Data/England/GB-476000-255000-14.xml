		<content>   From our questionnaire to parents   
and friends of the school we found     
that the most popular kinds of         
programme were drama and "soap         
operas". Sport was the second most     
popular ,followed by nature programmes 
and American crime series.             
   The television is on for an average 
of five and a quarter hours every day. 
   Although we sometimes enjoy         
programmes on television it may be bad 
for our eyes and we do not learn very  
much from it. There is a lot of boring 
stuff on.                              
   It also stops us getting outside so 
much and there is a lot of sex and     
violence shown which is probably bad   
for us.
