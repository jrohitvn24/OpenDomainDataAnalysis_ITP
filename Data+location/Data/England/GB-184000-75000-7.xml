 some 60 surviving crew members plus   
 more than 100 representing families   
 who died in H.M.S. Warwick assembled  
 for a reunion. This included a        
 Remembrance Service at St. Merryn     
 Parish Church, and dinner at the      
 Harlyn Inn. Padstow Lifeboat (from    
 Trevose Head) helped visitors to lay  
 wreaths on the sea in memory of those 
 who died when H.M.S. Warwick was sunk 
 by enemy action off Trevose Head in   
 l944.

 face casualty lift from the Lifeboat  
 House below was formally opened.
