		<title>03KNIVETON SCHOOL BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Kniveton Primary School is the only   
 primary school operating in our       
 area. Atlow School has been closed    
 for a long time and the one at        
 Hognaston closed 2 years ago because  
 it had become too small although it is
 expected that it will be re-opened as 
 a field centre to serve the area.     
 Kniveton School buildings are very old
 part of then dating back to 1861.There
 are two classrooms,one for infants and
 the other for juniors.The junior room 
 measures 8m by 4m and the infant one  
 4m by 4m.                             
 Attached to the old building is a     
 kitchen,where our meals are prepared, 
 and a new cloakroom toilet block.There
 is no hall or gym so we have          
 assemblies in the junior room and P.E.
 in the playground or the rough field  
 which is shared with cows and sheep.
