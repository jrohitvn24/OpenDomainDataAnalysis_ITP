		<title>03Limestone Dales: Derbyshire</title>
		<content> We are fortunate to live within       
 walking distance of two spectacular   
 dales, Lathkill Dale in the north and 
 Bradford Dale further south.          
 Both are characteristic of Derbyshire 
 dales with steep sided valleys at the 
 base of which clear streams splash    
 through successive rock beds and the  
 remnants of man made dams. Once these 
 valleys were the powerhouse of early  
 industry; today nature has reclaimed  
 all but a few crumbling buildings and 
 spoil heaps. Earlier this year some   
 young people tidied up Bradford Dale  
 repairing walls, clearing dead trees  
 and restoring the old sheep dip near  
 Middleton. Both dales are now havens  
 for many varieties of flora and fauna.
 Such is their beauty that both are    
 attracting incraesing numbers of      
 ramblers, nature lovers and tourists.
