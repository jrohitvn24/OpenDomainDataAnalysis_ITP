		<title>01A SUMMARY OF LYVEDEN</title>
		<content> Lyveden is a small area in rural      
 Northamptonshire. There are not many  
 amenities in Lyveden, apart from a    
 historical site called the 'Lyveden   
 New Bield', built by Sir Thomas       
 Tresham.The Bield is cruciform shape  
 and is meant to show the passion of   
 Jesus,as Sir Thomas was very religious
 and was persecuted for his Roman      
 Catholic beliefs.                     
 The area around Lyveden is mainly     
 farmland with non_grass arable crops. 
 There are only six inhabited buildings
 in the area, and most of the area is  
 owned by the Duke of Gloucester,      
 including Lyveden Manor which is at   
 the moment rented by tenants. There   
 are different types of deer in the    
 local woods, and various other types  
 of wildlife. Even though there is     
 a lack of activities in Lyveden,it is 
 a very pleasant and enjoyable area.   </content>
