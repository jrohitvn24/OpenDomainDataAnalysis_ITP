		<content> Man has changed our D block           
 drastically.                          
 At one time the the Wirral was        
 probably part of a{large forest .     
 However many rich people wanted to    
 make more money and  one perfect way  
 to make more money is by useing the   
 land .This meant the trees and bushes 
 that had been the habitat for many    
 animals over the years was cut        
 down.People began to build and many   
 estates have sprung up.Many buildings 
 were built,animals ran to the few     
 safe places.Big diggers made roads    
 and shops.Farm land was bought and    
 built on.Small parks were set up, but 
 the owners wanted more money and so   
 they built on the country.There are   
 now country parks.Rangers protect the 
 land.Many animals,plants and birds are
 recovering.     {
