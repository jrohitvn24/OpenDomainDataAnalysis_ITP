		<title>09BEMPTON'S IT'S A KNOCKOUT</title>
		<content>      Bempton and Buckton have very    
 little by way of customs but for the  
 last five years a group of villagers  
 have organised an{It's A Knockout }   
 competition. Teams from Bempton,      
 Buckton, Flamborough and Flamborough  
{Lifeboat}compete and the money raised 
 by the event is shared between St.    
 Michael's Church, Bempton Village Hall
 and Flamborough Lifeboat.             
      As many visitors are attracted by
 the cliffs it is almost inevitable    
 that there are some accidents. Thus we
 have strong links with the Lifeboat,  
{Coastguard }and {Air Sea Rescue }     
 service. It is for this reason that   
 the Knockout involves a Lifeboat team 
 and for the last two years has been   
 opened by the coastguard,Mr. Vic      
 Crossthwaite, firing a maroon and a   
 fly-past by the {R.A.F.}rescue        
 helicopter.                           </content>
