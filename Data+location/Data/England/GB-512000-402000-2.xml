    "Cabourne Parva is a farm which    
 stands in the middle of its farming   
 area unlike new farms today which are 
 built near major lines of             
 communications.                       
    The farm has nine furrow reversible
 plough for ploughing straight up and  
 down the field by turning upside down 
 where there is another nine shares. A 
 large set of spring-tine harrows which
 are used for raking the top soil where
 the soil is chalky or stoney. An      
 artificial manure spreader, a huge set
 of discs which are used for breaking  
 up the soil and some sprayers. There  
 are two Case tractors, two John Deere 
 and a Massey Ferguson tractor. There  
 is also a twelve foot bed             
 International combine. This machinery
