		<title>15 - INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE</title>
		<content> There is very little industry and     
 commercial enterprise in the area     
 because of its rural nature. What     
 little there is, came into existance  
 before local authority planning       
 regulations existed, and would never  
 be allowed to start up today.         
                                       
 The sandpits at Heathend and Coates   
 are the only viable non-agricultural  
 businesses. Because the sand lorries  
 have to be weighed there is a         
 weighbridge that is also available to 
 the public.                           
                                       
 A builders merchant operates from     
 the same premises as the Sandpits,    
 but only provides a retail service,   
 since all the goods that are sold are 
 bought in from the actual             
 manufacturers.                        
                                       </content>
