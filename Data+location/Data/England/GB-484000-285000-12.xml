		<title>12COUNCIL HOUSING</title>
		<content> The council houses on the Danesholme  
 estate have very small gardens,and the
 front gardens have fences around      
 them.The bricks that the houses are   
 built from are all the same colour    
 unlike the private houses.            
  The streets with private houses on   
 are usually a{mixture}of three and two
 story houses,sometimes with{flats}and 
{massionettes.}They are mostly terraced
 houses.                               
  The way the houses are set out is    
 that they are grouped around a        
{courtyard,}with covered alleyways     
 leading from one courtyard to the     
 next.                                 
  Some of the council houses have been 
 bought by the people who live in them.
