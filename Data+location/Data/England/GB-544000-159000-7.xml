		<title>07 FARMING - MACE FARM</title>
		<content> {Mace Farm}is situated about 1 mile   
N.E. of the village of Cudham. The farm
has been in existence for 300 years and
occupies an area of 292 acres.  The old
farm house fell down and the present   
building was erected in the 1920's.    
 There is only one full-time employee  
with extra help being brought in from  
other farms when needed. The farm grows
WHEAT,(sold to local flour mills),     
BARLEY,(exported to the Soviet Union), 
OIL-SEED RAPE,(sold to corn merchants  
for use in margarine and cooking oils),
and BEANS and SILAGE,(used for cattle  
feed).                                 
 The milking herd was sold in 1980 and 
now only beef cattle are reared, 50    
Charolais-cross cattle are bought in at
9 months of age and sold as 2 year olds
at Haywards Heath Market.              
 The farm has been owned by the same   
family since 1934.                     </content>
