		<content>BUS SERVICES                           
Borstal village is served by several   
bus routes run by Maidstone and        
District Bus Company. These bus        
numbers pass down Borstal              
Street:155,156,127 and 126. The        
representative of the company revealed 
that the buses were mainly used by     
people too young to have a car,young   
people who cannot afford to run a car  
and also by elderly people who cannot  
afford or don't want to run a car.     
Most buses on this route run to a      
profit,but the Sunday services don't   
so the company receives subsidy from   
Kent County Council. Frequency of      
service:one of these buses arrives     
about every half hour,and the service  
operates until just after 10 p.m. The  
152 service from Mereworth to          
Gillingham runs along the A228 Cuxton  
Road. It also is not profitable.       </content>
