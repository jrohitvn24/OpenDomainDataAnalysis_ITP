		<content> On Saturday we get up at 9 o'clock. I 
 go downstairs and set the table while 
 Mummy makes breakfast. Then we sit    
 down on a bench to have breakfast. For
 breakfast Mummy, Wendy and I have     
 cereal and Daddy has egg and bacon.   
 Then we go upstairs and get dressed.  
 Then we come downstairs and watch     
 television. At 11 o'clock we set off  
 to go to Grandma's. When we get to    
 Grandma's house (which is in          
 Harrogate) we get some fish and chips 
 from across the road and Wendy, Daddy,
 Andrew, Carl and I play snooker while 
 Mummy, Grandma and Grandad talk. At   
 teatime Grandad makes curry and we all
 enjoy it. After that we go home, have 
 a drink of milk and go to bed. My bed 
 is comfortable and I sleep well.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
