 RAMBLING BADGE. Thursday, June 6th.   
 will be our last ramble for our badge.
 At a Brownies Rambler Meeting, we     
 begin by giving in our 20p. admittance
 charge. We start our walk, which has  
 to fit in between 6 and 7.30pm.       
 Usually, we go down to the shop and   
 Mrs. Horton and Mrs. Roberts buy us   
 chewing gum and crisps and sometimes a
 bottle of pop to share with those who 
 have no drink.                        
 Usually, we go across fields and      
 stiles and streams and we see many    
 different kinds of birds and flowers.
