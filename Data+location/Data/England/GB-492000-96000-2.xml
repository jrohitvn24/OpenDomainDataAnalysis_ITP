 The area seemed to change from then on
 as many of the town's best buildings  
 were demolished to make way for new   
 developments. Many of the remaining   
{Georgian}and{Regency}houses have been 
 converted into flats or rest homes for
 the elderly.                          
 Today in 1985{Bognor Regis,}and       
 especially the{South-West,}remains a  
{residential}and{tourist area.         
 The area offers many facilities for   
 tourists and residents to enjoy.There 
 is of course the{sea}and the safe,    
{sandy beaches}where you can
