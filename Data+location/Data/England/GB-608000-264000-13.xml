		<title>13MENDLESHAM SCHOOL TODAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 Mendlesham school is a very little    
school.  It is a victorian building    
made out of bricks and has a slate     
roof. There are four classrooms but    
there are three teachers and three     
classes.  There is no hall so we use   
the spare classroom for assembly,      
music, television and things like that.
Around the school there is a playground
with a climbing frame.  In the summer  
the swimming pool is put up in the     
playground.  There is a path which     
leads to our playing field and canteen.
The canteen is separate from the       
school and dinners are cooked there.   
We sometimes use the canteen for       
dancing or PE or games if its wet.     
Our school is on the edge of the       
village. Children start when they are  
nearly five and leave to go to the     
middle school when they are nine.      </content>
