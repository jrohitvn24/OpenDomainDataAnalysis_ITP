		<title>18A PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT</title>
		<content> It was Thursady lunchtime and we were 
 all looking forward to tomorrow when  
 we would be demonstrating our work on 
 the Domesday Project to parents and   
 important people in the Barnet.       
 Then the announcement came, because   
 Jessica and Roger had written to her  
 the Prime Minister would be coming to 
 see us.Wow!                           
 On Friday after the sniffer dog had   
 been around and the police surrounded 
 the school and the parents had arrived
 we were pleased to see Mrs Thatcher   
 walking around the hall. She spoke to 
 each of us about our work, she was    
 very pleasant to us all.Afterwards she
 was interviewed by Jessica and Roger  
 about Finchley. After she had gone the
 newspaper people wanted to talk to    
 some of us and find out what she had  
 said to us. All in all it was a very  
 interesting day.                      </content>
