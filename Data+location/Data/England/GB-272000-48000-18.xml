		<content> One of the special features of the    
 area, and indeed of the whole of The  
 South Hams, is the beauty and richness
 of the hedgerows or Devon banks.      
 From early March, when the first of   
 the primroses appear, until July when 
 the foxgloves are 'going over' there  
 is a succession of colour.            
 Among the primroses, which are        
 abundant in many places, are          
 celandines and violets between the    
 unfolding ferns. Tall Alexanders then 
 Queen Anne's lace quickly grow. In May
 bluebells, red campion and stitchwort 
 give a patriotic colour scheme to the 
 roadsides. Closely trimmed sycamore   
 shoots break into varied red and brick
 coloured young leaves.                
 This beauty is fragile and must be    
 cherished. We must guard against hedge
 destruction, chemical sprays that only
 encourage grasses, and early trimming.</content>
