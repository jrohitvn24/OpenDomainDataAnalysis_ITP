		<content>    This block is developing as a      
 residential area with the growth of   
 several small industrial estates as   
 well. In the southern part of the     
 Block is the mining community of{     
{Armthorpe} with the pit itself -      
 Markham Main - just outside the Block.
{Edenthorpe}and{Kirk Sandall}in the    
 north of the Block are mainly residen-
 tial. The{River Don}crosses part of   
 the area. The glass firms of          
 Pilkingtons and Rockware are both     
 found in the area. There are two      
 comprehensive secondary schools:      
 Hungerhill serves the northern and    
 Armthorpe the southern part of the    
 Block. The link road to the nearby{M18
 crosses the area.                     
    Despite the many developments      
 taking place the area still retains an
 agricultural atmosphere in a few      
 places.                               </content>
