		<title>16COMMUNITY POLICING</title>
		<content> There are many criminals in our area  
 so we've got lots of police men and   
 women. The problem is many people     
 still don't care and make our area a  
 rough place but we have quite a good  
 police force.                         
  Over a month ago some of the police  
 force came and visited us at school   
 and told us all about the police      
 force. Their names were W.P.C.Grant,  
 W.P.C.Mathews and P.C.Evans. They told
 us that police cars were called panda 
 cars because long ago they where black
 and white like pandas. They also told 
 us about their working conditions and 
 also the different jobs in the police 
 force. We have policemen and women    
 patrolling different areas just in    
 case there is a robbery or something. 
 Nearly every day I see police men and 
 women patrolling our area.
