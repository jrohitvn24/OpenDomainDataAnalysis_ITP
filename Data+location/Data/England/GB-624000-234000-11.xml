		<title>11Farms in Trimley</title>
		<content>  In the past most of the houses in    
Trimey were along the Street,or High   
Road,and most of the farms were        
isolated. Many of the farmsteads are   
very old and some are mentioned as     
manors in the Domesday Book.           
  Searsons Farm is the largest holding,
covering about 1000 acres,not all in   
our block, It has modern sheds and a   
large grain drier.                     
  Grimston Hall,once the home of Thomas
Cavendish,the second Englishman to sail
round the world,is still a working farm
of 478 acres.                          
   Alston Hall,another Domesday manor, 
is now farmed from Goslings Farm,just  
outside our block.                     
   Great Street Farm is on the High    
Road,next to the Welcome Hall.It has   
503 acres of land.
