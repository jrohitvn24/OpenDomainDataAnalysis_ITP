		<title>01THE AREA AROUND FAIR OAK</title>
		<content>    Fair Oak was once a small village  
 but now it has grown to a semi-urban  
 sprawl with a population of more than 
 10,000. It is now almost joined to    
 neighbouring Bishopstoke (which lies  
 partly within our area)with new       
 housing developments eating away at   
 the open farm and woodland between.   
   Three miles to the west is Eastleigh
 once an important railway town, where 
 many of the inhabitants of Fair Oak   
 work. Eight miles to the north is     
 Winchester and Southampton is the same
 distance to the south.                
    Much of the open land is farmland  
 with some emphasis on dairy farming   
 but with also a great deal of fruit   
 and vegetable growing. Although not   
 the principal strawberry growing area-
 many farmers have gone over to "pick  
 your own"marketing.                   
    There is little or no industry.    </content>
