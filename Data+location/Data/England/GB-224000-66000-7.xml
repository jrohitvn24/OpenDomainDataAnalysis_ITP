		<title>07    St. Cleer Well.</title>
		<content>    Our  Well is in  Well  Lane, to    
 the North of the  Church.  It looks   
 like  a very small granite chapel.    
   It has a wall at the back with two  
 decorative arches, and two big arches 
 on the other sides. The roof is made  
 out of slabs of granite with pinnacles
 at each corner, from  which the points
 have been broken off.  There is a     
 small statue above the front arches of
 St. Clarus, who was a 10th century    
 bishop. At the front of the roof there
 is a granite cross.  There is a grid  
 to stop people falling in the water.  
                                       
    This well was a bowsening well,    
 which was supposed to cure the mad,   
 blind, lame and epileptics. People    
 throw money in the well to give them  
 good luck. The money is collected each
 year to help maintain the well. It is 
 the only  endowed well in the world.  </content>
