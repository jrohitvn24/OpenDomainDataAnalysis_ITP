		<content>{  THE ENVIRONMENT OF OWSTON           
   The village of Owston lies centrally
 in the square of{04760306}on a        
 northern slope of the clay uplands of 
 East Leicestershire,at about{700 }feet
 in a mainly agricultural landscape,   
 which is dissected by hedges,minor    
 roads,footpaths and streams. In the NE
 the area covers the edge of           
 Knossington ,including the Grange     
 School. With the exception of a few   
 isolated farms there is no other      
 habitation. Owston woods lie to the   
 SE,extending two kilometres and are   
 the relic of ancient forest. Owston,  
 once dependent on its abbey and       
 originally the centre of rural routes,
 is now very small and isolated. There 
 are no shops and few social amenities;
 the population is mainly dependent on 
 farming. Motor transport and          
 electricity are essential.            </content>
