		<title>18DOGMERSFIELD AREA FARMING</title>
		<content> Most of the land in this area         
 comprises farming land. There are     
 large areas of permanent pasture      
 alongside arable land. There are also 
 numerous copses of deciduous trees    
 amongst the fields. The grassland is  
 used for cattle grazing. The arable   
 land is in large expanses formed from 
 several older fields with the         
 hedgerows removed. Wheat, barley and  
 oats are grown. Dogmersfield Park,    
 formerly the grounds of Dogmersfield  
 House, is also used for farming with  
 the same combination of arable and    
 pasture land.
