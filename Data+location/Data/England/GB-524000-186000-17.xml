		<title>17JEWISH YOUTH GROUPS</title>
		<content>{Ezra}is a Jewish group for boys and   
 girls of different ages which meets on
 Saturday afternoons and other         
 ocassions. They have a wide variety of
 outings ranging from hikes to having a
 football match.                       
    In the summer holidays they arrange
 a camp for two weeks. They are very   
 original with their ideas for team    
 competitions. One Saturday night there
 was a peanut hunt and another day     
 orienteering. They have an outdoor    
 swimming pool most years and tennis   
 courts, not to mention snooker and    
 table-tennis tables.                  
{   Pirchim,}just like Ezra, is run by 
 the Aguda. They meet for an hour on   
 Saturday afternoons and learn the     
 Bible. On other days there are outings
 for instance going on hikes and seeing
 how a post-office is run.
