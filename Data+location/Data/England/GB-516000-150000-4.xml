		<title>04Nursery Gardens-Dorking NE</title>
		<content> We went to two nursery gardens and saw
 the difference between them .Surrey   
 is a good place for these because many
 people are rich and have{big houses   
{and gardens}so they need plants and   
 shrubs.The nurseries are near London  
 and one of them is on a main road     
 which will encourage people to come   
 in.This one employs{6 full time       
{workers,4 part time}and one summer    
 student.They buy all their            
{herbaceous,bedding and house plants   
 from Kent and their shrubs and herbs  
 from Chelmsford.They also sell garden 
 furniture,peat and fencing.           
   The other nursery employs{8 workers 
 all part time.Eve Wood took us        
 round.She has regular customers and   
 gives personal service.They only sell 
{bedding plants}and grow everything    
 from seed.They sometimes cut flowers  
 from what they grow.They are friendly.</content>
