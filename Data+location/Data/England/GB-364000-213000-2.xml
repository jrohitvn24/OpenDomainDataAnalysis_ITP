		<content> The Industrial Revolution, with its   
 need for iron and coal brought        
 Cinderford into being. Iron mining had
 carried on from pre-Roman times, but  
 in the Middle Ages the Forest of Dean 
 was reserved for royal hunting. Only  
 the villages on the outskirts are     
 early in origin, with Littledean being
 a much older place. By the mid        
 nineteenth century deep coal mines    
 were made possible by the introduction
 of pumping engines.                   
{Cinderford grew up from clusters of   
{cottages of the foundrymen and miners.
{In the 1960's the last of the deep    
{mines were closed, but Cinderford's   
{past is reflected in such buildings as
{the Miners Hall, College, (originally 
{a mining college,) and the Council    
{Offices which were colliery owners'   
{houses.
