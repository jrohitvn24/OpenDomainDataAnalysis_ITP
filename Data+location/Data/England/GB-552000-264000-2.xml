 The land is flat and close to sea     
 level. The scenery immediately        
 apparent is lines of irregularly      
 spaced willow growing along field     
 boundaries, and of long grassy        
 droveways reaching through to distant 
 fields. The exposed position allows   
 the prevailing westerly wind to sweep 
 unchecked across the fen, touched only
 by a few trees, thorn hedge and high  
 grass banks of the lodes. In winter   
 the fen is bleak and raw, in summer it
 has a softer, peaceful air.           
                                       
 Buildings                             
                                       
 The few isolated brick buildings      
 originate from local claypits in the  
 19th century. Newer buildings are     
 mainly postwar family extensions.     </content>
