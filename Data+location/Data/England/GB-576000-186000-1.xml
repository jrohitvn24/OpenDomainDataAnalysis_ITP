		<title>01Sth Benfleet and Thundersley</title>
		<content> This block covers two ancient         
 settlements: South Benfleet and       
 Thundersley. Both belong since 1974 to
 the large District Council of Castle  
 Point, a name which was coined when   
 the Canvey Island District merged with
 the Benfleet Urban District, which had
 only existed since 1929 when it was   
 formed from the parishes of           
 Hadleigh, South Benfleet and          
 Thundersley. For 45 years the name    
 Benfleet referred to all three        
 parishes and its use is still         
 confusing. It does not exist any      
 longer and{South Benfleet}once again  
 refers to the original settlement and 
 its development covering the southern 
 part of this block. It lies on a Creek
 of the river Thames about 35 miles    
 (56Km) east of London. Thundersley is 
 situated on a plateau covering the    
 northern part of the block.           </content>
