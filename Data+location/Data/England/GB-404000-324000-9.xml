		<title>09THE HORN DANCE</title>
		<content> A Horn Dancer came to our classroom   
 and talked to us about the Horn dance.
 He came in his outfit. His trousers   
 had oak leaves on them. He wore a gold
 and red waistcoat and another         
 waistcoat on top. He has been a dancer
 for eighteen years. He wore green     
 socks and black shoes.                
 Twice a year the horns are taken out  
 on horn dance day and fete day. The   
 horns are reindeer horns with carved  
 wooden heads. They are a thousand     
 years old and they are kept in St.    
 Nicholas' Church
