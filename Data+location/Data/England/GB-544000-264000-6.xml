      We interviewed Rev.Mac Donald    
 Milne.The first question we asked him 
 was"Would you like the village to be  
 changed in any way".He answered that  
 question by saying this"Yes there is  
 plenty of things".Another question    
 was"How long have you been doing your 
 job".Rev.Mac Donald Milne answered"I  
 have been working for two years".The  
 next question we asked him was"Is     
 there anything important happening in 
 your village over the next few weeks".
 The answer that he gave us was"Yes    
 there is going to be a fete".He gave  
 us lots of intresting answers about   
 the village of Landbeach.
