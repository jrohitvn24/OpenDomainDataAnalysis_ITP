		<title>06OTTERTON MILL (II)</title>
		<content> About 4,00 tickets are sold every year
 and about 19,000 people just come to  
 look around the shops! Admission is Â£1
 for grown ups and 50p for children.   
 There are about 10 craftsmen          
 altogether making pottery and         
 woodcarving .They work in the out     
 houses at the back of the Mill.  She  
 employs one person all the year round,
 Ian Crowther, and she employs  7-8    
 people in the season. The restaurant  
 is the thing that brings in the most  
 money. The food they make is all      
 wholemeal food.                       
   People that visit the Mill either   
 come because they are interested in   
 water power or because they put on    
 exhibitions. Others like the cooking. 
 They have 5 doves, 20-40 hens and     
 loads of fish in the stream.
