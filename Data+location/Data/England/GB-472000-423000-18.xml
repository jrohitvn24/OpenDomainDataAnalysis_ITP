		<title>18ST.JOSEPH'S SCHOOL, GOOLE</title>
		<content>  St.Joseph's Roman{Catholic}Primary   
 School was opened in 1980 and is the  
 most recently built school in Goole.  
 Our{school}is the only one with       
 pupils aged from 5 to 11, all the     
 other first schools transfer their    
 children at the age of 9.             
  Our school was built where a playing 
 field and some allotments used to be. 
 There is still a playing field big    
 enough for 3 rounders pitches, a      
 running track and a large playground. 
  Inside, we have a big hall for P.E.  
 and assemblies, 5 areas where we have 
 lessons and a library.                
  There are 100 children in our school 
 and we do lots of{interesting}things. 
 For example, this term we have grown  
 plants and put them in tubs and flower
 beds all round the school to make it  
 more attractive.
