		<title>19THE BLUEBELL RAILWAY</title>
		<content> 25 years ago steam trains were still  
 part of every day life but fast       
 disappearing. Railways declined with  
 the coming of motor transport. In 1948
 railways in Britain were nationalised 
 and British Rail began closing        
 uneconomic lines. Despite protests the
 Lewes to East Grinsted line finally   
 closed in 1958.                       
 A year later the Bluebell Line        
 Preservation Society was formed and   
 purchased 4 half miles of line. They  
 began a limited service in 1960 (this 
 year it celebrates its quarter century
 ) Thanks to much voluntary effort. The
 railway now runs the whole 5 miles to 
 Horsted Keynes daily in summer Sundays
 and Bank Holidays throughout the year 
 (not Christmas Day)                   
 It employs 12 full-time workers and   
 about 400 part-time voluntary helpers.
