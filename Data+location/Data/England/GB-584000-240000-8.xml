		<content>   Since William the Conqueror's time, 
the river has been important to Sudbury
for moving wool, grain and other goods.
The Mill Hotel, with its working wheel 
is a conversion of one of the old      
river mills.  The grazing land beside  
the river is largely unchanged since   
"Domesday" times and is technically    
still owned by the families named in   
the great book.  The river and land is 
under a conservation order by Babergh  
D C with a river manager, Mr Black.    
A dismantled railway line runs along   
the river and has been converted to a  
public way called "The Valley Walk"    
   Sudbury Rowing Club, the only one in
Suffolk, have used the river for their 
sport for over 50 years.
