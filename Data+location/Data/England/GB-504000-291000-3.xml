		<content>                                       
We have sewing machines to sew with and
to mend clothes.   We have lawn mowers,
vacuum  cleaners,  washing machines and
tumble driers.    Some people have dish
washers and coffee makers.             
We have tools like hammers, chisels and
screw-drivers  for making  and  mending
things made  of wood  or metal  and for
joining things  together or for  fixing
articles like  pictures and placques on
our walls.                             
We use spades, forks, hoes and rakes to
do our gardening.                      
Some tools are  driven by  electricity.
We have power saws, hedge cutters, lawn
mowers and drills.                     
Construction  firms use large  machines
like  bull-dozers,  cement  mixers  and
cranes.
