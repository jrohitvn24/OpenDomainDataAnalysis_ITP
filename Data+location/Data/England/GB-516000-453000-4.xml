		<content>{ }In{1945}my Grandad worked for Mr    
 Hawkins at Southfield farm. He worked 
 7am.to 5.30pm.and half day Saturdays. 
 His pay was 2p per hour. The 300 acre 
 farm had 30 cows ,12 pigs ,170 sheep, 
 8 horses,200 hens,60 cattle.It grew   
 wheat,barley,oats,clover,and roots.   
 With his Clydesdales he could plough a
 20 acre field in 20 days.He enjoyed   
 hedging but he didn't like building   
 the high stacks.The first tractor     
 came in 1938.His work was hard, and   
 long but it was very varied.          
{  Now}my Grandad works for John Walkup
 at Church Farm.His hours are 8.00am.to
 5.30pm. They have 4 tractors and 1    
 forklift.  The 500 acre farm has  450 
 pigs and 87-cows.They grow peas,rape, 
 barley,wheat and grass.               
 In the last 40 years Grandad has seen 
 many changes. He misses working with  
 horses but he prefers combining today.</content>
