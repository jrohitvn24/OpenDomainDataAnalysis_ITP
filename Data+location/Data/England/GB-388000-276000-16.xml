		<title>16Living in Broome</title>
		<content> I quite like living in Broome because 
 it is out of the way of busy traffic  
 and factories but, it has its         
 disadvantages because none of my      
 friends live in Broome. The children  
 that do are much younger or older than
 me. I am 12. There are no shops       
 (except for a rather expensive organic
 foods shop) and there are no clubs for
 children, so I go to Blakedown Church 
 Youth Club on Tuesdays, but only if I 
 get a lift in a car. In the winter    
 we usually miss some School because   
 all the snow blows off the fields in  
 several metre high snow drifts and    
 blocks our drive and the local lanes. 
 Broome has 115 residents and is built 
 around a triangle of lanes. It is     
 thought to have been founded in 1154  
 when Henry II gave it as a gift to a  
 nobleman and called it after the      
 yellow broom shrub. (Pamela Pheysey)  </content>
