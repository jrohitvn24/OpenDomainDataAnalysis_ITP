		<content>   There is evidence that this area has
 been inhabited and prosperous for     
 thousands of years.                   
   The Long Barrow marked on survey    
 maps was a pre-Roman burial mound.    
   The Saxon churches and the medieval 
 Manor House indicate village life     
 continuing through to the Middle Ages.
 The circular dovecot near the Manor   
 House is said to be one of the oldest 
 in the British Isles. The wool trade  
 flourished in the Cotswolds and the   
 market town of Cirencester was        
 convenient for the local farmers.     
    The advent and increase of         
 mechanised transport has brought a new
 type of prosperity to the area        
 bringing a changing community of      
 commuters who work in cities as far   
 away as London. Sadly this has led to 
 the loss of some village amenities.
