		<content>   Old coulsdon is a residential area, 
 with mainl detached and semi-detached 
 houses. There is one parade of        
 fourteen shops. There is a wide range 
 of shops, for example:- greengrocers, 
 Post Office, chemist, mini-market,    
 butcher, and baker. People of all ages
 use these shops, and the busiest days 
 are Fridays and Saturdays. We         
 interviewed a lady in the mini-market,
 and she said "it's tiring working     
 here". Old Coulsdon has a public bus  
 service with five bus routes: the     
 109,190,411,409, and 166. The people  
 questioned at the bus stop thought the
 service was efficient and punctual.   
   In some parts of Old Coulsdon ther  
 is a problem with vandalism. A survey 
 around Byron School showed that       
 graffiti was the main problem.
