		<title>09A WALK THROUGH BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   We came out of the un-manned station
 that is being converted into holiday  
 flats and the station-master's house  
 that is also a holiday home and we    
 were in the top of the village where  
 houses are newer and one was being    
 built - a bungalow made of granite    
 blocks.  There was a concrete mixer   
 and a wheelbarrow with cement.        
   We met and interviewed some people  
 who were going to the station.  One   
 lady goes shopping to Plymouth twice a
 week, another, who goes on the train  
 once a month, has lived in Bere       
 Ferrers for thirty years.             
   We came to the village pump which   
 still works and is used.We saw anotice
  saying "Fresh Eggs for Sale." There  
 were other notices about village      
 events.We passed the lovely church and
 a hotel.The Post Office and shop are  
 near the quay where we had a picnic.  </content>
