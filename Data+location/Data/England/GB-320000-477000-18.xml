		<content> Dangers of Development:               
    The countryside around Askam and   
 Ireleth is not only valuable farmland 
 of high agricultural grade (Grade 3)  
 but also of superb aesthetic value    
 from a natural history point of view, 
 but there are pressures to develop the
 land for other purposes, not the least
 of which may be industrial development
 such as chemical works similar to     
 those in a nearby block.              
     The land closest to the shore has 
 its limitations for agricultural use  
 but surrounding land is ideal for this
 purpose. The Duddon Estuary site      
 itself is classified as an area of    
 special scientific interest and is    
 protected by policies which underline 
 its importance. Indeed there are a    
 number of nearby sites (SSI) which    
 stretch around the estuary to Walney.
