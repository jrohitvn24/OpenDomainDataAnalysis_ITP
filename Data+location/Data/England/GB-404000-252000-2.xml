		<title>02Dunnington Primary School</title>
		<content> Dunnington School has 40 pupils. They 
 are taught in 2 classes; the infants  
 by Mrs. Longstaffe and the juniors by 
 the headmaster, Mr. Reeks. Mr. Reeks  
 has taught at the school for 12 years 
 and is retiring at the end of this    
 school year. The school was built in  
 1876, on land given by the Marquess of
 Hertford. The school did not have a   
 playing field until 1932. Before 1953 
 the lavatories were 2 buckets inside 2
 huts, then Elsan toilets were         
 installed. It wasn't until 1960 that  
 hot and cold running water and proper 
 flush toilets were put in. A kitchen  
 and staff room were also added at this
 time. A new headmistress, Mrs. M.     
 Hood, has been appointed this term.   
 She is coming to us from Lapworth     
 Primary School.
