		<content>      The children play{games}like     
 Bulldog.  Bulldog is a game to see how
 fast you can run and dodge other      
 people.  One person is "on".  He or   
 she stands in the middle of the       
 playing field, and the other people   
 have to get to the other side without 
 being 'tigged'.  If you are 'tigged'  
 you are on with the person who tigged 
 you, and you have to help him tig the 
 people who are left. It carries on    
 like that.                            
      There is another game they play. 
 It is (hot rice - cold sago).  This is
 a game of trying to hit other people  
 with a small ball.  If you hit them   
 they are on and they have to hit      
 someone else and so on.  To start the 
 game off you stand in a circle and    
 bounce the ball.  If it goes through  
 someone's legs, then they're on.
