		<title>09THE BELL INN WILLERSEY</title>
		<content>{The Bell Inn}was originally a         
 fourteenth century farmhouse and      
 stands back on the village green      
 opposite the duck pond. It has been a 
 pub for one hundred and forty years   
 and has only had four landlords. The  
 customers' ages vary from the youngest
 at seventeen to the oldest who is     
 eighty eight and still enjoys his     
 morning pint. There are six darts     
 teams and three quiz teams.The main   
 feature of the Bell is a unique       
 collection of mugs. There are five    
 hundred and eighty in all ranging from
 a complete set of first and second    
 division football club mugs to the    
 many commemorative ones of which some 
 date back to Queen Victoria's time.   
 Outside The Bell there is a collection
 of old farming implements.
