		<title>06LANDSCAPE WESTPORT LAKE</title>
		<content>  Westport Lake used to be the site of 
Port Vale football club,then the ground
sunk and became a tip and was polluted.
Today there are two lakes,with a path a
mile long around them.A lot of people  
use the lake,they go fishing and       
sailing.You can walk around the lake.By
it there is a small nature reserve,with
many types of wildlife there.You have  
to be careful because it is like a     
swamp.There is a little lake which is a
bird sanctuary,with a little island for
birds to nest.On the car park there is 
a snack-bar in the Summer,and there are
also some toilets.The lake has many    
visitors both in Summer and in Winter. 
         A rubbish tip is now a public 
park in Stoke-on-Trent.
