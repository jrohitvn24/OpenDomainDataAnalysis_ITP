		<content>{Wood End} comprises 29 houses. At the 
 foot of a rise stands the old Post    
 House, now a private residence. This  
 thatched house dates from the Stuart  
 period, possibly 1605. Mains          
 electricity &amp; water were installed in 
 February 1985. The present owners     
 moved in in October 1984.             
   At the top of the rise stands Wood  
 End House, rebuilt about 150 years    
 ago. The stables have been converted  
 and the property stands in 17 acres.  
 The Lodge at the drive entrance is    
 very old, revealing walls of wattle   
 and daub.
