		<title>06MINING FOR CLAY ON ARNE</title>
		<content>   In September 1974 the issue of Ball 
 Clay mining on the beautiful Arne     
 Peninsula came to a head. 200         
 objection letters were received by the
 County Planners and a Wareham-Arne    
 Action Group was set up with the      
 support of many conservationists,and  
 on September 25 1974 an 800 signature 
 petition was presented to the Planning
 Committee.                            
   The Planning Committee was          
 recommended to pay compensation to the
 English China Clay Company who had    
 already been granted permission to    
 mine for the Ball Clay.This proved    
 unpopular with many people as the     
 ratepayers would in effect be stopping
 the "Rape of Arne".The outcome was for
 the mining to commence,but 10 years   
 later,the mining has had little       
 influence on the landscape.
