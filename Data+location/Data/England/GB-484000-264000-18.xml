		<title>18     Water Supply</title>
		<content> The water supply is the responsibility
of the {Anglian Water Board,the largest
Board in the country.} Rain and river  
water is collected and stored at       
Grafham Reservoir which was man made   
to abstract water from the river Great 
Ouse.The water then goes to the large  
Hannington Reservoir which holds       
6000,000 gallons.The water goes to the 
treatment works where it is purified   
by the addition of chemicals &amp;         
chlorine &amp; is filtered.Northants is a  
flat county &amp; because the land is not  
sufficiently high for resevoirs,water  
storage towers have to be built on the 
highest land in the area.Our water is  
piped from Hannington and pumped into  
storage towers at Doddington and Earls 
Barton.
