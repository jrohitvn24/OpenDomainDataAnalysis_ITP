		<content>   In Holt,there is the headquarters of
 a company which deals in the unusual  
 business of vehicle registration      
 plates. Tony Hill, the owner, has     
 become well known for this and other  
 activities such as making pop records 
 and running disco's for children and  
 charities. He has been in the vehicle 
 registration business for twelve      
 years. He started off working as a    
 salesman in central heating. His car  
 at that time had a "cherished" number 
 plate which gave him the idea of      
 starting the vehicle registration     
 business.He now buys hundreds of      
 vehicles a year and sells off         
 interesting or unusual registration   
 numbers to people who want their      
 number plates to appear distinctive or
 personal. He has provided plates for  
 many famous people and has written two
 books on registration numbers.        </content>
