		<title>05POP STARS AND GROUPS</title>
		<content> Some of the most popular music stars  
 and groups are Paul MaCartney, The    
 Flying Pickets, Michael Jackson, Duran
 Duran, Buck Fizz, King, Wham and      
 Frankie goes to Hollywood. I like to  
 dance to records from,Michael Jackson,
 Paul MaCartney, Duran Duran. Pop music
 is quite an industry. Besides records 
 you can buy T shirts, badges,         
 stickers, magazines, posters,         
 autographs, head bands, arm bands and 
 other cheap objects. Rock, reggae,    
 heavy-metal, soul and pop are ace. I  
 have a poster of Duran Duran, I       
 haven't any badges but I have got a   
 lot of stickers of pop groups and     
 stars. I like to listen to The Flying 
 Pickets. They are clever. They sing   
 without any musical instruments. They 
 sing different parts. I like the      
 leader of them and the little one with
 curly hair and a hat.                 </content>
