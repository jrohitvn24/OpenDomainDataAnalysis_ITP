		<title>13Myself-a girl called Louise.</title>
		<content>   My name is Louise and I was born in 
 Newcastle General Hospital in 1975.  I
 live on Chapel House estate and go to 
 Milecastle First School.  My favourite
 subject is History.  I do not like    
 Maths.                                
   I have blonde hair and blue eyes and
 I weigh 4 stone.  I have a brother    
 called Gianni.  My Dad is called      
 Anthony George and my Mam is called   
 Lesley Ann. I have a pet rabbit       
 called Flopsy.                        
   My favourite food is tortilinni and 
 belly pork.  My favourite clothes are 
 flowery skirts and dresses.  My       
 favourite pop group is Wham.          
   My Mam and Dad drive a car, and I   
 like riding my two-wheeled bike.
