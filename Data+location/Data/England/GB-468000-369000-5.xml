		<content> The school in Walesby is a Church of  
 England Voluntary Controlled Primary  
 School. Although there has been a     
 school in the village since 1878 the  
 present building was started in 1966, 
 being completed to its present size of
 six teaching areas in three stages.   
 There are approximately 180 children, 
 aged from 4+ to 11, on roll with a    
 staff consisting of headteacher, seven
 teaching staff, secretary, caretaker, 
 5 kitchen staff and 3 lunch-time      
 welfare assistants. There are also    
 visiting peripatetic staff for        
 specialist music and drama work. The  
 school has a number of resources      
 including T.V., video and four BBC    
 computers. The children in the school 
 travel in from a number of villages   
 including Walesby, Kirton, Haughton,  
 Perlethorpe, Bothamsall, Tuxford,     
 Wellow, Boughton and Ollerton.        </content>
