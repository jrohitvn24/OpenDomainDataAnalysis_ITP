		<content>    The attractive village of Chewton  
  Mendip has a beautiful church with a 
 famous Somerset tower in the          
 perpendicular style. Dedicated to Mary
 Magdelene the church has traces  of a 
 Saxon building on the site of the     
 present chancel, and a Norman arch    
 opposite the south door. The peal of  
 eight bells is reputedly the finest in
 Britain.                              
    St Mary's in Litton is a smaller   
 church and tower with a Norman        
 piscina, and a Hagioscope near the    
 pulpit, which is in the Jacobean style
 like the altar rails.                 
    St Lawrence's at East Harptree is  
 largely Norman and is set in the midst
 of a pretty stone built village.      
    All three churches are well worth a
 visit.
