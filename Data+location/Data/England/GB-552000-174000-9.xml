weekend.  After school on friday I go  
home have my tea and watch television  
until 9 p.m. .  On Saturday morning all
my family go shopping, for clothes and 
things we need for school ect. After   
lunch I play with my friends and my Dad
usually dose the gardening, if its     
sunny my Mum likes to sunbath. In the  
evening the whole family goes to play  
squash, after squash we go swimming and
there is an inflatable dragon for us to
play on its great fun.  Sunday morning
