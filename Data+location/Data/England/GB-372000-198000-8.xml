 The buildings and roads are mostly    
 built on the Marlestone platform      
 (middle lias) because the limestone   
 soil is too hard to grow much on it.  
 Above this level is the Stinchcombe   
 Hill escarpment. On the Inferior      
 Dolite on the plateau top is rough    
 pasture and the Golf Club. Beech woods
 grow on the Cotteswold Sands of the   
 steep sides of the hill. It would be  
 difficult to grow trees on the top    
 because of the weather. The canopy of 
 branches and leaves allows only small 
 shrubs to grow. The roots come up to  
 the surface of the soil because there 
 isn't much goodness underneath. The   
 farms and sown grasslands are situated
 mainly on the gentle slopes and lower 
 lias clays of Dursley, Cam and        
 Stinchcombe, where the land is not too
 steep to use tractors.                </content>
