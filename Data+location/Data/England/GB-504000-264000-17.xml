		<content> There are no places within the village
 for children to pursue leisure        
 activities.                           
 For sports such as squash and         
 badminton they have to go to Bedford. 
 Brownies are held at Dean.            
 There are also several after school   
 activities.                           
 The Upper School at Sharnbrook offers 
 many evening classes of recreational  
 nature as well as vocational classes.
