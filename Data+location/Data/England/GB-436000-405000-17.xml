		<content> If we stand on a round-about more cars
 will pass than being on a leading off 
 road.                                 
 If we stand on one side of the road we
 cannot see the cars going up the other
 way, so we should have partners to see
 the other side.  Also we will have    
 another on our side to catch the      
 registratoins if we miss them.        
 If we go out at different times of the
 day we will get different answers, so 
 the time we go out at 11.00 a.m._     
 12.00 a.m. will be buisier than 3.30  
 p.m. in the afternoon because of rush 
 hour traffic.                         
 I think we should go out for 15-      
 minutes so that gives us enough time  
 to survey the cars.  Also to go out   
 more than once and at different time  
 of the year.
