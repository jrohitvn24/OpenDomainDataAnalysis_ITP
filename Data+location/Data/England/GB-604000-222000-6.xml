		<content>   After school at 3pm I usually       
 play with my friends Gary and         
 Jonathan. They come to my house and I 
 get changed Into other clothes and    
 then we go to gary and Jonathans      
 houses. My mate who is sixeen goes to 
 a sailing club  so we are allowed     
 in his boat and we sail around in the 
 river. We go in at half past five  to 
 have our dinner. Then we come out     
 again and sometimes we have competions
 on jonathans computer playing         
 'Defender'. We go in and scrounge some
 money off our mums and spend it on    
 sweets. On saturday we sometimes bike 
 it up to Arlesford and places         
 around.we sometimes go up to the      
 university to play tennis. Then we go 
 round Garys and have a sodastream.
