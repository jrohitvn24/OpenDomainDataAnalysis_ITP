		<title>02Hollybush Farm.</title>
		<content>{Hollybush Farm}was the first farm we  
 visited.It was rather different       
 because it had a brand new chapel.It  
 is used by a lot of people as a       
 church,a meeting place and it had a   
 small private shop squeezed into the  
 corner of it.In the summer at big open
 air services people get baptised in   
 the River Wiske which runs through the
 farm land. The farmer is a religious  
 man.There is a caravan site behind the
 chapel.                               
 The next farm we visited was{Home Farm
 at Newby Wiske.There were about five  
 hundred sheep being dipped.The smell  
 was disgusting.They had twenty horses 
 for riding.Down a cart track were     
 barley and wheat fields.Poppies were  
 growing wild at the edges of the      
 fields,and the fields were divided by 
 hawthorn hedges.
