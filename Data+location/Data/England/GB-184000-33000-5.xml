		<content> The town is surrounded by breathtaking
 scenery and its waters provide safe   
 moorings for many visiting sailing    
 craft.St.Mawes castle built in the    
 time of Henry VIII is a favourite     
 point for tourists to visit and       
 although just outside this block,     
 deserves a mention,as visitors to this
 point of the Roseland Peninsula always
 visit this famous castle.             
{Walking and Sightseeing.}There are    
 many coastal and countryside walks for
 tourists who prefer to see the beauty 
 of the area at a slow pace.           
 For those who like to visit old       
 churches,then this area is of         
 particular interest.The Parish Church 
 of St.Just_in_Roseland,thought by many
 to be one of the most beautiful in    
 England,was founded in Norman times,  
 but has since been re built.Some parts
 date back to 1261. {PTO               </content>
