		<content> I sit near the Millstone Country Hotel
 I can hear;singing birds,bees buzzing 
 ,noisy cars go on the road.Trees      
 partly camouflaging houses,rows of    
 flowerpots,a rockery within my sight. 
 It is peaceful when no cars pass.A    
 slamming car door breaks the peace.   
 It's a hot day.A phonebox by the      
 bridge was being used by someone now  
 it looks peaceful.Cows eating grass or
 just sleeping.                        
 I'm sitting on a picnic table adjacent
 to a hotel.On the right there's a road
 along which one or two cars travel. A 
 couple of seconds more pass;it seems  
 very isolated here at this hotel but  
 very welcoming.A genial breeze        
 suddenly gusts papers flap.Ahead      
 countryside's in view.The sun's hot   
 and is blazing down.On the right are  
 trees.A house is so surrounded by     
 trees it's hardly visible.            </content>
