		<title>17A multi-fuel cooker</title>
		<content>Most homes are heated by electricity,  
coal,or oil, as there is no natural gas
supplied to this area.                 
Since an epidemic of Dutch Elm disease 
among the trees in this area,there has 
been an abundance of cheap,even free   
wood.Some homes have taken advantage of
this and installed multi-fuel cookers. 
One particular stove is made in France 
and as well as acting as a cooker it   
provides hot water and heats fifteen   
radiators for central heating.It burns 
wood,straw logs and solid fuel.Daily   
maintenance is essential to prevent the
fire from going out and the chimney    
must be swept annually.It is reliable  
and provides a focal point in the      
kitchen.The family even give it a pet  
name...Gladys!When storms leave the    
rest of the village without electricity
this particular family are warm and    
well fed.                              </content>
