		<content>  First mentioned in the{Domesday Book 
{of 1085}the village is nine miles     
 north-west from Leicester and eight   
 south-west from Loughborough, only one
 mile south-west of the M.1 motorway   
 junction 22 with the A50 Leicester to 
 Stoke-on-Trent road.                  
  The{population is slowly declining   
 and there are{approximately 500 people
 living in and around the village      
 today.Most of the land is{farmed}and  
 the village is overlooked by the      
 Cliffe Hill Quarry, which has produced
{granite}since about 1860.             
  Many of the houses in the village    
 date back to{Victorian}times, although
 some council property was built in the
 1960's and some private dwelling in   
 the 1970's.There is a{primary school  
 in the village itself and a{secondary 
{school}nearby.
