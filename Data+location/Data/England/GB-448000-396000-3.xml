		<title>03Employment. Youth Scheme</title>
		<content> A youth training scheme is run by the 
 council it is intended to give young  
 people employment.One such person is  
 in our school.There was a wide variety
 of opportunity but she chose to work  
 with children,even though she didn't  
 have any say which school she would be
 placed in.On the scheme Michelle gets 
 Â£26.25 per week plus Â£3.00 bus fare   
 allowance for her{transport.}Michelle 
 thinks the{youth}training scheme is a 
 good idea because it gives young      
 people a chance to{work.}She is better
 off now she has joined the scheme,as  
 she is getting more money than she was
 on the social security and most of all
 she is gaining work experience.She    
 would recommend it to other young     
 people leaving school.
