		<content> The{City School sports area}is in sq. 
 9569. We have completed a survey to   
 find out how many children use it. The
 most popular sports were swimming,    
 junior activities,roller skating and  
 gymnastics.                           
 Activities which children would lke to
 see at the area were fencing,shooting,
 go-carting and ice-skating.           
 Most people used the cafeteria or bar 
 facilities after taking part in sport.
 In sq. 9571 there is the{Carholme golf
{and race course.}From 1849 to 1964 the
{Lincolnshire Handicap}race was run    
 here. Three race meetings are held    
 every spring. The stand holds about   
 2500 people and it has a bar and      
 club room too.                        
 The golf club is in the same square as
 the race course, it was established in
 1906 and there are about 500 members. 
 The club house is not in our square.  </content>
