		<title>13Boldron Village</title>
		<content>  Boldron Village used to be called    
{Bolt-hole,}because it was used as a   
 refuge by highwaymen who had robbed   
 coaches on the main road.(now the A66)
  Boldron used to be a hamlet with a   
 few houses on one side of the green   
 and was gradually extended during     
 Georgian and Victorian times(and quite
 recently)to its present size.         
  Its population is 87 people:64 adults
 (10 O.A.Ps.);23 children.Many of the  
 residents are newcomers to the area.  
  The village has a church,a chapel,and
 a public house/post office.The public 
 telephone box acts as the local point 
 of collection for newspapers.         
  An annual fete is held on the village
 green,whilst the village hall is used 
 every alternate fortnight for Women's 
 Institute meetings and whist drives.  
 The hall is also hired out for dances 
 and discos.                           </content>
