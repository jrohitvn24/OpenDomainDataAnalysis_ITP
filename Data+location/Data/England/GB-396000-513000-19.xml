		<content> Without personal transport one is     
 virtually isolated.One bus per day    
 travels west,one bus per day travels  
 east.These services are supplemented  
 by a market day (Wednesday)service.In 
 car owning families,it is             
 often the husband who travels to work 
 in it leaving the wife without        
 transport for the greater part of the 
 week.Government policy is presently   
 aimed towards greater privatisation of
 services and a reduction of subsidy to
 operators in the hope that this will  
 create a more needs orientated        
 service.It seems a far cry from the   
 days when there were at least three   
 trains per day each way to say nothing
 of a regular,reasonably priced rural  
 bus service.It would be pleasant to   
 see a social subsidy paid to those in 
 rural areas to combat high fuel prices
 which penalise rural living.          </content>
