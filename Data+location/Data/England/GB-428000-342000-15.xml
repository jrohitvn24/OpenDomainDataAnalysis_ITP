    There is a local amateur dramatic  
 society called the Yew Group which    
 produces plays in the Church.         
                                       
    There is a{Trout Farm}in the S.W.  
 corner of our block.  The building    
 where the young trout are reared was  
 previously a mill where local farmers 
 took their corn to be ground into     
 flour until early in the 1920's.  When
 the trout are larger they are put into
 one of the large ponds which make up  
 10 acres of the farm.  When they are 1
 or 2 years old they are sent all over 
 the British Isles to re-stock rivers  
 and lakes for angling.                
    This particular farm introduced    
 trout into the Falklands in 1953, and 
 exports trout eggs to S. Africa,      
 Kenya, India and Sri Lanka.
