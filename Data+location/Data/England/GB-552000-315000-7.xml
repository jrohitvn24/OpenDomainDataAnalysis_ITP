		<content> This is on WALPOLE CHASE and was      
 seeded during 1983.For the first year 
 little use was made of it,but at the  
 moment it has a CRICKET PITCH and two 
 FOOTBALL PITCHES in winter.Three local
 football teams use the pitches,       
 WALPOLE UNITED,WALPOLE CHASE and the  
 Sunday team PRINCESS VICTORIA.There is
 a five a side pitch at one end of the 
 field.The CRICKET TEAM lost all their 
 games in their first year(1984)but in 
 the local league and friendlies this  
 summer have a 50% success rate.The    
 field has mobile changing rooms,      
 toilets and a groundsmans shed.
