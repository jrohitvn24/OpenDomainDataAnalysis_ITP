		<title>17SOUTH SHIELDS TYNE PILOT RTD</title>
		<content> I was apprentices in the pilot service
 in 1928. My duty was to put the pilots
 on board ships from an open rowing    
 boat. It could be very dangferous at  
 times, especially when the sea was    
 rough and the ship was rolling.       
                                       
 Until recently, Shields' Pilots have  
 nearly always lived close to the      
 river's mouth, on the{Lawe Top},from  
 the time of Richard the Lionheart.    
 They also claim Viking ancestry.      
                                       
 I became a pilot in 1946 and was 30   
 years a TYne Pilot until I retired in 
 1976, my 66th birthday.               
                                       
 The river is not nearly so busy now as
 when I was piloting, but we live on an
 island and will always require ships.
