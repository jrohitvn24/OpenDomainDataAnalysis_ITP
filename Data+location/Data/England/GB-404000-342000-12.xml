		<title>12BUILDINGS IN ALTON</title>
		<content>Probably the oldest building in Alton  
is St. Peter's Church,built in 1178 by 
the Normans and completely rebuilt in  
1256.Alton Castle was first built by   
the Normans in 1158.The new castle,    
built by Pugin over the ruins of the   
Norman Castle is still in good repair  
and is now a boarding school.The       
chapel which adjoins the school has an 
intricately-made roof called the       
"Golden Roof".In the old castle a      
beautiful grotto has been made from    
the ruined walls.                      
  St. Johns Church adjoins a convent   
which was used as a hospital when it   
was built in 1840.St Johns School,     
attached to the convent,has two        
storeys,although most of the upper     
storey is used as a Guild Hall.The     
Church,the school and the convent were 
all designed by Pugin.
