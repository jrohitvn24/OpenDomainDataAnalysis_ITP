		<content>      Although Feniscowles, Blackburn, 
 is primarily a residential area there 
 are three major industrial units.     
 These are two paper mills and a fuel  
 oil depot.                            
      Hargreaves Fuel Oil has been in  
 Feniscowles for about 25 years. They  
 are situated on the banks of the      
 Leeds/Liverpool Canal adjacent to a   
 main road, Livesey Branch Road.       
      The firm distribute gas oil for  
 industrial and domestic uses. The gas 
 oil comes from Ellesmere Port, near   
 Liverpool, and is taken to all parts  
 of Lancashire.                        
      Hargreaves employ only two full  
 time staff and two drivers, but they  
 take on extra staff in their busiest  
 time, winter.
