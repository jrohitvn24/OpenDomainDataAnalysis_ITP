		<content> Housing.                              
       A good deal of housing has been 
 built within the last ten years in    
 Nawton and Beadlam. Most of it has    
 been infill.                          
       There is some council housing in
 the three villages but there is less  
 and less rented housing available     
 because owners are renting them out as
 holiday cottages or selling them to   
 people who want them for that purpose.
       The cost of housing in these    
 villages has risen sharply as retired 
 people and professional people have   
 moved into the area.                  
       Many barns and farm buildings   
 have been converted into housing and  
 villagers believe that this has helped
 to "tidy up the village".             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
