		<content> Showborough Nurseries: 8 years ago a  
 family from Holland, bought           
 Showborough House with 25 acres of    
 land. The land was planted with       
 hardwood saplings which are now sold  
 as mature trees to public parks and   
 estates. They converted the stable    
 block into living accommodation and   
 sold Showborough House with 5 acres of
 land. This has now been converted to a
 residential home for the elderly. 14  
 residents plus two families who run   
 the above now live there. 15 local    
 people are employed.                  
                                       
   Showborough Common: this has        
 a fluctuating population of gypsies.  
 They are genuine people and good      
 neighbours.
