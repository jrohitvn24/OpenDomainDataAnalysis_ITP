		<content>  Farming is the main occupation in the
 area, some farms being privately owned
 others being smallholdings which are  
 leased from the County Council.Some of
 the smallholdings are no longer run as
 farms but are owned by newcomers who  
 use their land for grazing horses.Most
 fields are small with hedges as bound-
 aries.'Pick your own'fruit farming is 
 a further use of land.Such farms      
 specialise in selling soft fruits and 
 vegetables direct to the public.      
  The majority of the farms are prim-  
 arily dairy farms but calf rearing    
 plays an important role in the income 
 of many farmers.Large farms also grow 
 cereals for animal consumption.Those  
 farms which include hill grazing rear 
 sheep.Some grazing land is let.Sheep  
 dogs for controlling livestock are    
 kept on most farms.One farm special-  
 ises in rearing pigs.                 </content>
