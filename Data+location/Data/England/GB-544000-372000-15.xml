		<title>15Farming changes near Alford</title>
		<content>  The area is not affected by industry 
 but has been changed by modern        
 technology. Ditches are polluted by   
 surplus nitrogen run-off and the      
 growth of blanketweed abounds. Sparrow
 hawks were almost exterminated in the 
 1960's by DDT but now, because the use
 of DDT and its group has been limited,
 the species has fortunately revived.  
  Forestry, horticulture and           
 agriculture have changed in response  
 to economic and government pressure.  
 Drainage and extensive fertiliser use 
 are common. There are fewer meadows   
 and pastures and more cultivated land.
 Woodland is becoming more coniferous  
 and less deciduous with a resulting   
 effect on the wildlife that relies on 
 the broadleaf trees. One of the       
 casualties of extensive drainage is   
 the snipe, its traditional haunts     
 shrinking fast.                       </content>
