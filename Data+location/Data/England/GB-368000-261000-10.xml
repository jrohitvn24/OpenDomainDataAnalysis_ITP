		<content> Near Yearston Court and Kiln cottages 
 there is a lot of{wildlife.}The rest  
 of the countryside is the same. The   
 same{creatures}seem to setle in all   
 around here. Between Yearston Court   
 and the road is a dried out lake and  
 in this now-dry trench are lots of    
{oaks. Beeches}are also common. The    
 trench is covered in dry leaves.{Grey 
{squirrels}and{rabbits}live there. It  
 is quiet and dark. The{squirrels}often
 hop about in the leaves.{Tawny owl's  
 nests are plentiful in the trees.     
{Foxes}live amongst the tree roots and 
 the young{cubs}play there. It is a    
 quiet, pleasant place. But recently,  
 in the brook behind the court, that   
 goes into{Sapey brook, mink}have been 
 found. They are disturbing the        
 wildlife. They are a pest and people  
 are trying to get rid of them.
