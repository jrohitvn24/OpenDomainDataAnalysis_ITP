		<content>   In most of the households surveyed  
 two people worked. The marjority of   
 these worked in Norwich rather than in
 the surrounding villages. Out of      
 fifteen workers most of them had      
 worked for more than ten years at the 
 same job.                             
   The average worker worked for forty 
 hours a week.                         
   More people were public sector      
 workers,than anything else.Most of the
 people we asked worked full time,     
 rather than part time.                
   We worked out that the average      
 income of a weekly full time worker   
 was between fifty and one hundred     
 pounds.                               
   Of the houses we surveyed ,most     
 people were in full time employment.
