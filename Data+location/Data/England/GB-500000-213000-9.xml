		<content> On Wednesday we did a survey. We saw  
 the war memorial. It is a big tall    
 building with a clock in the middle.  
 It is to remind us of all the brave   
 soldiers who died in the war._Louise  
 The children in our class visited the 
 Chiltern Open Air Museum on the 19th  
 June 1985. This museum is set in 25   
 acres of Newlands Park Training       
 College. All the building are from the
 Chiltern area. They have been taken   
 down and reassembled. Skilled         
 craftsmen are then employed to restore
 the buildings to their original       
 state.Vicky and Karen                 
 Every year the Studham school children
 perform in a Christmas Concert in

 the younger children performed        
 Cinderella(with songs and music by Mr 
 Stephen Beaven) and the older children
 provided a choir and orchestraV Hodges</content>
