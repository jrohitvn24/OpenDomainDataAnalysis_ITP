 District Councils appear to serve the 
 area adequately.Most people are       
 satisfied with public services though 
 some are not happy with the health    
 services.Most people have some form   
 of transport and feel roads are kept  
 satisfactorily.Provision of shops is  
 considered reasonable.There are no    
 strong feelings towards the youth
