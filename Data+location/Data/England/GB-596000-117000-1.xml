		<title>01LANDSCAPE IN CAMBER</title>
		<content> Coming from the east The Midrips      
 Cottages seem to be built entirely on 
 the edge of a great area of shingle   
 the other side is flat marshland and  
 ahead a block of coastguard cottages. 
 The sea wall blocks the view of the   
 sea, and on the right is a row of     
 small bungalows and a small cafe.     
 Approaching Camber there is a large   
 farm house and buildings very well    
 appointed, then the first of the      
 camping sites for static touring      
 caravans and tents. There are some    
 large houses built at the level of the
 sea wall, small shops and bungalows   
 line the main street- a general store 
 and Post Office, a village hall with  
 building going on behind on the right 
 a small and fairly modern church and  
 vicarage.  The large building of the  
 Holiday Camp.  The village is on the  
 Walland Marsh and so is very flat.    </content>
