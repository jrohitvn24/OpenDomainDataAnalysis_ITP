		<title>05FORESTRY - DERWENT VALLEY</title>
		<content>    Chopwell Woodlands has been looked 
 after, on a leasehold basis, by the   
 Forestry Commission since its         
 formation in 1919.It once belonged to 
 monks, who leased it to farmers and in
 turn was leased to noblemen and       
 clergy, but because of their          
 importance, the woodlands were        
 eventually kept by the Crown.         
    Coalming has left the land with    
 many problems involving subsidence.   
 Since nationalisation in 1947 records 
 show that drift mines broke surface in
 at least two places in the woodlands. 
 Today felling of trees continues. Two 
 forestry workers are responsible for  
 the organisation throughout the wood- 
 lands of the North East. Great care is
 taken not to disturb the balance of   
 nature and natural habitat of much of 
 the wildlife when felling takes place.
