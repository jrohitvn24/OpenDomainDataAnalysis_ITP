		<content> B.P.Nutrition  is a part of the       
 international B.P. company. They make 
 food additives for animal feed, which 
 include vitamins, minerals,trace      
 elements and medicines. The raw       
 materials are cereals,fats,fish       
 meals and vegetables. 60,000 tons of  
 additives are produced each year and  
 sales total Â£30,000,000 per annum.    
 Most of the production is sold in the 
 U.K. with only a small percentage for 
 export. The Wincham factory is the    
 largest and most up-to-date B.P.      
 Nutrition operation in Europe and was 
 opened in 1975. However, the original 
 firm was founded over 60 years ago by 
 the Leigh family as an animal feed    
 mill. In the thirties a local farmer  
 discovered the beneficial effects of  
 mineral additives and asked the Leigh 
 firm to produce them for him. The rest
 is history.                           </content>
