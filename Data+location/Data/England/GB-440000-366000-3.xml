		<title>03GRASSMOOR TRAINING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The{Grassmoor Training Centre,}opened}
 in 1952, covers an area of 6 acres. It
 is built on the site of the exhausted 
{Grassmoor Colliery.}The centre, which 
 trains men for the North Derbyshire   
 coalfields, is unique. On the one site
 are facilities for training mining,   
 electrical and mechanical engineers   
 for the coal industry. About fifty men
 spend up to eleven weeks at the centre
 on training or refresher courses. The 
 site has several classrooms and       
 workshops, offices, a cafe, a gym as  
 well as numerous galleries. These are 
 tunnels built on the surface to give  
 the men realistic experiences of      
 mining life. Before they enter the    
 galleries the men have to go to a     
 Contraband Zone where they are checked
 for dangerous items just as if they   
 were going into a real mine. The site 
 also has various sporting facilities. </content>
