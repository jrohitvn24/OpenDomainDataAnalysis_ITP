		<content> Middleton has plenty of pubs to suit  
 everyone.{GARRY Age 18 }"I like modern
 pubs &amp; go for the video games &amp;       
 company. I don't drink. Pubs are an   
 important part of social life in      
 Middleton because there is nothing    
 else to do. Some pubs are very popular
 with young people and that's a good   
 idea - you can meet people your own   
 age. Pubs are good meeting places     
 before you go on to somewhere else    
 like a club or a party."{MUMS &amp; DADS  
 like traditional old-style pubs, cosy 
 &amp; friendly, to meet their friends &amp;   
 have a good chat &amp; play darts. Pubs   
 are popular because people say there  
 is nothing else to do in Middleton &amp;  
 they are a good part of social life.  
 Nothing will take the  place of a pub.
 Everyone agrees that the {Old Boar's  
{Head}should be preserved because it is
 very historical.                      </content>
