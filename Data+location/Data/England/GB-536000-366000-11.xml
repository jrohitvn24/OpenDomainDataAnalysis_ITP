		<title>11Reverend J. Thorold.</title>
		<content>     Revered Thorold has been vicar of 
 the Spilsby group of churches since   
 l977. During this time he has seen a  
 small rise in the size of his         
 congregation due, he considers, to the
 introduction of the family service.   
 Everybody is welcome to this family   
 service and where possible members of 
 the congregation take part by reading 
 extracts from the bible and reading   
 the prayers.                          
     The duties of a vicar are to      
 baptise, marry and bury; to visit the 
 sick and elderly and to train young   
 people in the knowledge of God. He    
 also has to prepare services for the  
 worship of God on Sundays.            
     Reverend Thorold is a much loved  
 and respected member of the community 
 and the sight of him pedalling his    
 cycle around his parish is as familiar
 as the postman doing his round.       </content>
