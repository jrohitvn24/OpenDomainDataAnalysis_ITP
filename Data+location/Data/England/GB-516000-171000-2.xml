		<content>   A local resident born in Ham in{1894
  gave us the following information.   
   There were 80 children in Ham in{   
{1900}with very few buildings. There   
 were no shops apart from a draper, a  
 post office and a dairy There were    
 several farms and open spaces. The    
 first trams appeared in{1915}between  
 Richmond and Kingston.                
   There were horse drawn carriages and
 the milkman called five times a day.  
 The only school was the{Russell School
 which was at the corner of Petersham  
 Park. The children walked to Richmond 
 for cookery lessons.                  
   They celebrated{V.E.Day}by a        
 firework party on the common and      
 street parties.
