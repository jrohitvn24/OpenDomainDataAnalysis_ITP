		<title>14Life At Elford Manor</title>
		<content>                                       
Miss Mary Dyott is the grandaughter of 
the last Lord of the Manor of Elford.  
She has told us many interesting facts 
about life at the hall when she was a  
girl and the changes she has seen in   
her life.When she stayed at the hall   
there was of course no  central        
heating,no light other than candles and
no bathrooms.There were however 3 water
closets.The water for these and the    
taps in the kitchen and pantry was     
pumped up by hand to a tank in the     
house twice a day.One of the many      
things she remembers was that everyone 
dressed for dinner even if it was quite
a simple meal.One of the puddings they 
often had was fresh Angelica tart.The  
Angelica was grown in the gardens.
