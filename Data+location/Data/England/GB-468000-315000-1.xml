		<content> On Thursday I got up at 06.30. I got  
 washed at 07.55. Then I watched       
 "Breakfast-time". I got dressed. We   
 had breakfast of cornflakes and toast 
 at 08.00. After breakfast I went      
 upstairs and brushed my teeth and     
 hair. Then I went to School. I arrived
 at School at 08.40 and played outside 
 until assembly at 09.10. We started   
 lessons at 09.30. At 10.30 we had     
 break. Afterwards we watched,"Animals 
 in Action," on the video. We had      
 dinner at 12.00. At dinner break I    
 practised running with an egg and     
 spoon. Afternoon school started at    
 13.15. I got home at about 15.30.Later
 I watched T.V. We had tea at 17.50. At
 20.00 I was sent upstairs because Mum 
 had a playschool committee meeting. I 
 watched T.V. until 21.35 when I went  
 to bed.My date of birth is 25.9.74.
