		<title>07Housing:Nether &amp; Over Silton</title>
		<content> The majority of houses in Over Silton 
 are owner occupied;most are very      
 attractive new or modernised and      
 improved stone built properties.There 
 is an increasing trend for old houses 
 in this area to be bought and improved
 by those working in the large towns.  
 Nether Silton however has a greater   
 proportion of rented houses as a large
 part of the village is privately owned
 by Silton Hall Estate.                
 Silton Hall situated at the Western   
 end of the village green was formerly 
 a school for orphans of the clergy    
 established in 1800.The cottages owned
 by the estate are stone built,detached
 or semi detached and some date from   
 the 16th century although there was a 
 period of building early in the 19th  
 century.Apart from the two council    
 houses there is only one new home in  
 Nether Silton built in 1974.          </content>
