		<title>15DARTINGTON'S HISTORY</title>
		<content> Dartington is first mentioned in      
 a Saxon charter in 833 when LADY      
 BEORGWYN owned "the farm by the       
 Dart",an early Saxon settlement in    
 Celtic Devonshire. John Holland,Duke  
 of Exeter,half brother to Richard     
 II,built Dartington Hall in 1388.Over 
 the years its fortune changed.It was  
 in a derelict condition when Dorothy  
 and Leonard Elmhirst bought the hall  
 in 1925 and began their imaginative   
 and exciting programme in rural       
 reconstruction.This project was to    
 affect and enrich the local community.
 As well as creating jobs in forestry, 
 agnculture, horticulture, pottery and 
 textiles, joinery and the world famous
 Dartington glass factory, the arts and
 education were encouraged. Co-existing
 with the Hall, yet independent of it, 
 is the lively village with the        
 amenities of a small town.            </content>
