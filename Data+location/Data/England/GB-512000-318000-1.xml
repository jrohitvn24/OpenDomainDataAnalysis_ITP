		<title>01OVERVIEW-THE LAND,SOUTH FEN</title>
		<content>    Two very small hamlets are found in
 this area known as South Fen, Twenty  
 to the extreme north-east and Tongue  
 End to the extreme south-east. The two
 hamlets are separated by the rivers   
 Bourne Eau and Glen.  The major part  
 of Tongue End itself is outside the   
 survey area and even with the addition
 of the few scattered farm houses the  
 total population is less than seventy 
 inhabitants.                          
    The land within the area is flat,  
 rich,black reclaimed fenland lying    
 between two and three metres above sea
 level.  The land is protected from    
 flooding by the highly-banked river   
 Bourne Eau, which flows through the   
 area from west to east, and a modern, 
 sophisticated drainage system managed 
 by the Black Sluice Board to the north
 and the Welland and Deepings Drainage 
 Board to the south of the river.      </content>
