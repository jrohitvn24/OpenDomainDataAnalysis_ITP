		<title>13Woodlands around Cattistock</title>
		<content> There are three privately owned woods 
 of mixed species.  An old plantation  
 has been felled and replanted with    
 ash, beech, rowan and hornbeam.       
 Chestnut, sycamore, lime, oak and ash 
 trees predominate throughout the area.
 In the watermeadows near the river are
 alder.  White willows north of the    
 river give a glow of orange-red colour
 in late winter.  Flowering cherries   
 are numerous around the village and   
 churchyard spectacular in early May.  
 There are several hazel coppices.     
 Chalmington Firs is a small area of   
 conifer plantation.                   
 Few hedges have been eradicated, many 
 are ancient.  Hazel, blackthorn,      
 elder, bramble, hawthorn, sloe and    
 crabapple are the main components.    
 Some are still laid by hand, but this 
 is very costly.  Otherwise they are   
 cut annually by machine.              </content>
