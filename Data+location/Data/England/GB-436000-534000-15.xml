 US A TENT AND WE STILL HAVE IT TODAY  
 AND LAST YEAR WE CAMPED OUT (THAT     
 MEANS SLEEPING IN IT,) THE TENT IS A  
 TWO MAN TENT AND CAN HOLD ABOUT SEVEN 
 YOUNG PEOPLE.LAST YEAR ME (IAN DARBY,)

 RAIN GOING THROUGH AND SOAKING YOU.THE
 TENT IS MADE NYLON AND WE ARE GOING O 
 CAMP OUT THIS YEAR WITHOUT GRAHAM BELL
 BECAUSE HE HAS HIS OWN TENT NOW AND
