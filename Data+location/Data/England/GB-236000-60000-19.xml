		<title>19THE VILLAGE BREAKFASTS</title>
		<content> This event must be a unique community 
 service to the tourist trade in       
 Cornwall.                             
 On eleven summer Saturdays the {      
{Village Hall}is open from 6am until   
 9.30am serving breakfasts to those    
 visitors who have travelled through   
 the night.It is a community service   
 because all the organisations who use 
 the hall take charge of a Saturday.   
 Each provide enough helpers to park   
 cars,work in the kitchen and serve the
 breakfast.                            
 The finances are beneficial to both   
 hall and organisations as it is the   
 policy of the hall committee to share 
 profits,half to the hall and the rest 
 divided equally between the           
 organisations. The 1984 profits       
 exceeded Â£1600. The Hall's share is   
 used for major projects,for example,a 
 clubroom was built in 1981.           </content>
