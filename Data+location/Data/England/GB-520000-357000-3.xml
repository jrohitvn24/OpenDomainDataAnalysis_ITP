 used to extract sand and gravel.It has
 board-sailing,water-skiing and        
 boating,also fishing and horse riding.
 Tattershall Castle is near the centre 
 that is why it  is called the Castle  
 Leisure Centre.The gravel works is    
 next to the Centre and when it is     
 worked-out the land will be used to   
 extend the Centre.There is a field    
 where the horses are put in.It is on  
 the main road so the cars can see it. </content>
