  WE VISITED AN OLD PEOPLE'S HOME      
 CALLED'CHARLSTON COURT' IN BAMBER     
 BRIDGE. WE ASKED AN OLD LADY LOTTY    
 WHAT CHANGES HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE   
 AREA. SHE TOLD US THAT THE TRAFFIC HAD
 INCREASED A LOT AND OTHER PEOPLE      
 THOUGHT THAT THE NUMBER OF HOUSES HAD 
 INCREASED ENORMOUSLY. THE OLD PEOPLE  
 SAID THAT THEY FELT MORE CONFIDENT IN 
 THE HOME THAN IN THEIR PREVIOUS       
 HOUSES. AN OLD GENTLEMAN -MR          
 BILLINGTON  SAID THAT IT WAS CHEAPER  
 TO LIVE THERE THAN IN HIS OWN         
 HOUSE.HE SAID HE GOT Â£36 AND HIS WIFE 
 GOT Â£22 PENSION A WEEK AND BOTH OF    
 THEM FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO LIVE ON    
 THAT - FORTUNATELY HE HAD OTHER       
 SOURCES OF INCOME TO HELP THE         
 SITUATION. ALL THE OLD PEOPLE SAID    
 THAT BILLS WERE THEIR GREATEST WORRY. </content>
