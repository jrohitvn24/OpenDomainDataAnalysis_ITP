		<title>01Upper Nidderdale N Yorks</title>
		<content> Two small villages and small valley   
 farms make this a pleasant tourist    
 area though not in the National park  
 nor an area of outstanding natural    
 beauty.                               
 Todays visitors come on foot along    
 many of the paths (including the new  
 Nidderdale Way) cycle or by car. The  
 railway closed in 1929 and the track  
 removed in 1936 and the land taken    
 back by the farmers but the route is  
 clearly visible. A regular bus service
 is, except in summer, virtually a     
 thing of the past. There ae several   
 campsites, bed and breakfast and hotel
 accommodation but the youth hostel    
 closed in 1983. The land rises severly
 from the Nidd and becomes poor. Only  
 for sheep,grouse rearing and timber   
 lofthouse houses some of the water    
 board workers buy. There are no lead  
 miners.                               </content>
