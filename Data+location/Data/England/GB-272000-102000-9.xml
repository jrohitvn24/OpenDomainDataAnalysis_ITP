		<title>09MORCHARD ROAD</title>
		<content>   Morchard Road is a small village on 
 the main Exeter-Barnstaple road, where
 the road to Torrington turns off, and 
 on the cross roads to Morchard Bishop 
 and Down St Mary.  The garage is the  
 main business in the village today. It
 sells food and drink as well as       
 petrol.  The pub next door is called  
 the Sturt Arms, after the family who  
 were originally Lords of the Manor. It
 has been a pub for well over a hundred
 years. At the beginning of this       
 century there was also a slaughter    
 house at the pub. The other main      
 business today is the saw mill, where 
 Mr Frank Howard makes seats, tables,  
 name plates, etc.  The Station is     
 unmanned nowadays, but trains stop by 
 request. The building is used as a    
 house.
