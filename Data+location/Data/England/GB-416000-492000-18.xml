		<content>   The{Quoits Club }was formed in 1978.
 There are 23 members. From May onwards
 they  play on  Mondays and Wednesdays.
 They are in the Zetland and Lower Dale
 Leagues.In 1984 they were Zetland  2nd
 division champions. They travel  north
 to Bowes  or  as far south as Sowerby.
 38 games have been played this year.  
   My family moved into the{New Inn }in
 1984.My Dad used to be a policeman but
 now he is a landlord. He and Mum serve
 drinks, English  and  European lunches
 and suppers.  My Mum won a trophy this
 year for making German food. Customers
 enjoy playing darts and dominoes.     
   Louise's grandad was the publican of
 the {"Odd Fellows Arms" }for 28 years.
 In 1984 it was renovated by new owners
 and became the{Countryman's Inn.}There
 are  five  guest rooms.  Lunchtime and
 evening meals are served and there are
 the usual pub games and teams.        </content>
