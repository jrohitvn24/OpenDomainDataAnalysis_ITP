 the South the land rises to cliffs.   
 Accommodation is provided near the    
 beach by chalets,with showers,toilet  
 and cooking facilities.There is a     
 solarium here.                        
   An outstanding natural feature is   
 the{Trow Rock}.Its ragged outline is  
 topped by a W.War 2 bunker.There is a 
 similar emplacement to the South in { 
{Frenchman's Bay}.On top of the cliffs 
 is a grassed area of several          
 acres,which houses an athletics       
 stadium{Gypsies Green}.This is used   
 for exhibitions, displays and         
 carnivals.The{Great North Run}        
 finishes here.
