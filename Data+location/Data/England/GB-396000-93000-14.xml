		<content> I love discos and I usually go to     
 Upton Club.You have to have membership
 which costs Â£1.50 for an adult which  
 allows their family in as well. Upton 
 Club is near the library and          
 clinic. They have all different kinds 
 of entertainment like groups, discos  
 and parties. They have a bar in the   
 next room so people can go and have a 
 quiet drink. I love it especially at  
 Christmas when the club puts on a     
 party for children aged 10 to 16 years
 old.We have a meal and disco and I get
 to know lots of other people in the   
 area. They also put on a pantomine for
 the younger children. Upton Club is a 
 great community idea.
