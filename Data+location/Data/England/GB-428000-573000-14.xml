		<content> In Seaton Delaval we have a{joint     
{church}which is used by Methodists and
 URC.It is on Elsdon Avenue and on 7th 
 May, the minister Mr. Cash came to    
 talk to us. He told us of the         
 organisations which use the church. He
 also said that the old Presbyterian   
 church which is near our school, was  
 the first Presbyterian church to be   
 built in England. On 9th May we had a 
 visit from an officer of the{Salvation
{Army}called Mrs. Dean. She told us of 
 the history of the Army in Seaton     
 Delaval and especially of a man called
 Harby Hook who was 91 and had served  
 the Army in our town since his        
 dedication in 1895. We also visited   
 the local parish church,{Holy Trinity}
 in Seghill and were shown around by   
 Father Murray. Many of us knew these  
 people through going to Sunday School.
