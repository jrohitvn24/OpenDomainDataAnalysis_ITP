		<content> Most of the people we spoke to liked  
 living in the country. They liked the 
 freedom, the space around them and    
 they liked the peace. One lady we met 
 was not at all happy. She had a very  
 comfortable bungalow with a beautiful 
 garden in a secluded trust estate. But
 she did not drive, and she was half a 
 mile from the bus stop. She liked the 
 walk but she hated having to wait for 
 the bus and all the time that she had 
 to waste.She also found it very lonely
 in the winter.                        
 Since we originally spoke to her ,she 
 has moved to Hove and says she has    
 never been happier in her life.
