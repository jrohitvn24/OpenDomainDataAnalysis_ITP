		<title>03The Silk Mill.</title>
		<content>   The Silk Mill stands on it's own    
 island in the middle of the River Test
 and there has been a mill there for   
 many hundreds of years.At the end of  
 the last century the Hide family      
 bought the mill and they introduced a 
 new industry to the town,the spinning 
 of Momme Silk.                        
   The silk now used at the mill comes 
 from China and Japan.Several weights  
 of cloth are now made,from the        
 lightweight cloth for scarves to the  
 heavier material used for the black   
 gowns worn by barristers.             
   The building is three storeys high  
 with a small bell tower and is faced  
 with brick.It was built in the late   
 eighteenth century.There is a small   
 shop there where you can buy some of  
 the material that they produce.The    
 mill is to close this year in October.
