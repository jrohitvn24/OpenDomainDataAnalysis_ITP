		<title>16Changes and Attitudes</title>
		<content> The{obvious changes,}according to the 
 elderly who live in Bourton, are the  
 growth in{tourism,}expanding{trade}and
 the big increase in the{number of cars
 bringing with them more people. The   
 elderly feel as though they are being 
 pushed out of the village. There are  
{new housing estates}and many{existing 
{houses}have been{renovated}to make    
 them habitable once more. There are   
 many old buildings left in the village
 the oldest being the{Dovecot}behind   
 the{Manor House.}Young people tend to 
 feel much more strongly about the     
 tourism and feel that the tourists are
 taking over the village by pushing    
 them out. The elderly feel that the   
 younger generation is outgoing, think 
 more deeply and communicate more with 
 their parents. The young people think 
 that the elderly are suspicious of    
 them yet they try to be friendly.     </content>
