		<title>16ROMAN VILLA _ CHIGNALS</title>
		<content>                                       
   The Roman Villa at Chignal St.James 
was discovered in 1975. The outlines of
ditches and banks can be seen from the 
air, and it was an aerial survey that  
found it. The villa can be found in    
Great Banks Field.                     
   There is an elaborate defensive bank
built around the villa, this could     
possibly of post Roman origin.         
   A great deal of pottery was         
discovered although no complete items. 
In lower excavations Iron age pottery  
was discovered .                       
   The date is thought to be shortly   
after the Roman conquest calculated    
from a bronze broach that was found.
