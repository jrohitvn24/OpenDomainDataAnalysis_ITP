		<title>12INGLEBY ARNCLIFFE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Ingleby Arncliffe (pop 350) is cut off
 from neighbouring villages by its     
 position between two busy roads, A19 &amp;
 A172. The parish church also lies away
 from the village across A172, where it
 stands next to Arncliffe Hall. The    
 village is divided into  two sections.
 Ingleby Cross is a group of buildings 
 situated around the crossroads of the 
 former Stokesley to Northallerton road
 A pub,the Village Hall and war        
 memorial are here. Ingleby Arncliffe  
 lies 800 m. up the hill. The two are  
 linked together now by new housing. In
 recent years housing deveopments have 
 produced a commuter village serving   
 Teesside via A19. The one shop and    
 post office are situated in the main  
 street. Also here, are the Methodist  
 Chapel built in 1863, and the village 
 school. The local butcher owns the    
 abattoir which lies behind the Main St</content>
