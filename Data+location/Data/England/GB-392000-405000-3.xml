		<content> I GET UP AT SEVEN AND WATCH T.V. UNTIL
 QUARTER PAST. I HAVE BREAKFAST, A     
 CEREAL, AND GET DRESSED. I SET OFF FOR
 RASCA AT 7.45. RASCA IS A PLACE THAT  
 LOOKS AFTER CHILDREN WHILE THEIR      
 PARENTS ARE AT WORK. MY MUM WORKS     
 THERE. WHEN I GET THERE I PLAY GAMES  
 ON THE COMPUTER. WE SET OFF FOR SCHOOL
 AT 8.40 AND ARRIVE AT 8.45. I MEET MY 
 FRIENDS AND WE PLAY GAMES. WHEN THE   
 BELL RINGS WE LINE UP AND WE GO INTO  
 ASSEMBLY. AFTER THAT WE DO ENGLISH AND
 HAVE A BREAK AT 10.35. MY FRIENDS AND 
 I PLAY TWO-BALL ON THE WALL. WHEN THE 
 BELL RINGS AGAIN WE LINE UP AND DO
