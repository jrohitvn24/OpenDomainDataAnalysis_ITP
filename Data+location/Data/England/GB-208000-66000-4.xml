		<content> There are 60 Friesian cows which are  
 milked twice a day in an abreast      
 parlour. The milk is collected at 8 in
 the morning by tanker and taken to    
 the Lostwithiel factory.              
     There are some followers_ that is 
 young cows and about 150 beef animals.
 These are mostly Hereford/Friesian    
 crosses although there are also some  
 Limousin, Charolais and Simmental     
 animals                               
     All these animals are housed in   
 the winter because it is too cold for 
 them outside.                         
     There are 420 ewes and their      
 lambs. The sheep only come inside at  
 night while they are lambing and until
 the lambs are about 12 hours old. Twin
 lambs are all put in plastic coats    
 with numbers on. This is to help      
 protect them from the rain.
