		<content> A few years ago, road resurfacing     
 reached the bridge at Plucks Gutter. A
 platoon of Army Cadets with their     
 officer asked permission to lay a{mock
{demoliton charge}as an exercise. While
 making an artistic arrangement of     
 wires and modelling clay, they found a
 real charge! This (50lbs of Gun       
 Cotton) had been installed in the dark
 days of 1940 by the Army or Home      
 Guard, and all record lost.{Bomb      
{Disposal Experts}were about to blow up
 the charge in a nearby field when it  
 was pointed outthat they had placed   
 the explosives over the{main gaspipe  
{to}Thanet. After this, a search was   
 made of all the bridges in East Kent. 
 Other{charges}were found, relics of   
 the time when a German invasion was   
 expected at any moment and men stood  
 to arms in every field.
