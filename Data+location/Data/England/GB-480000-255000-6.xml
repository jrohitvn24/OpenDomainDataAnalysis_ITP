		<title>06 BRAFIELD STADIUM</title>
		<content>Brafield stadium lies between Hackleton
and Brafield on an unclassified road   
off the A428 and B526.                 
Since 1955, during the summer months it
has become the venue for car races of  
many different types.These are usually 
held on Sunday though there are other  
meetings e.g.Bank holidays.            
Some of the cars which race at the     
stadium are:-                          
Hot-rods which are very fast cars,     
Midgets which are very fast small      
cars, Bangers,which travel fairly fast 
but are allowed to knock into each     
other during the race.These are old    
vehicles which have been bought cheaply
from a scrap-yard.Stock-cars also race 
while sometimes Ministars which are    
small cars for children between the    
ages of 10 and 16 are allowed to race.
