		<title>07HOME FARM: BROWNHILLS.</title>
		<content>   Children from Millfield School      
 visited this farm of 350 acres. They  
 discovered that the land was mainly   
 arable; barley, sugar beet and        
 vegetables being grown. The farmer    
 kept 17 bullocks which were  being    
 fattened for beef and were fed unsold 
 crops and silage.                     
   Until recently there had been a     
 small wood near the canal, but        
 vandalism had prompted the farmer to  
 turn the area over to grass. He had   
 been happy for local families to      
 picnic there, but when youths rode    
 motorcycles through his barley crop   
 and fired shotguns, not only at the   
 birds, but near him, he decided that  
 the wood must go.                     
   A 200 foot bore-hole provided water 
 for irrigation. It was pumped up by   
 electricity and then distributed by a 
 system of underground pipes.          </content>
