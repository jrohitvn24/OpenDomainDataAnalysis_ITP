		<content>{A DAY IN MY LIFE by Andrew Martin     
 Saturday.I got up and went downstairs 
 for breakfast_the usual,boring........
 cornflakes.I watched television for   
 about two hours,then went to get      
 dressed.I put on my jeans and Aston   
 Villa top.Mum then asked me to go     
 shopping.It took me about half an     
 hour.When I got back I was excited    
 because today was the cub's cup final 
 day.I played on the computer for a    
 while,then I got my football kit      
 packed and set of for the football    
 ground.We all had our team photograph 
 taken.I was playing in defence.We     
 played well for the first ten minutes 
 and soon led 1-0.That day was hot so  
 at half time were soaked down with a  
 freezing cold bucket of water.In the  
 second half we scored to make it 2-0. 
 After the match we were excited and   
 happy about winning.                  </content>
