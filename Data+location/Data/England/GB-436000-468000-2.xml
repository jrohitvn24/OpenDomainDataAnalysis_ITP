		<title>02The Houses we live in</title>
		<content> Most of the people who live in the    
 area have two floors in their houses. 
 Some live in older houses with three  
 floors and others live in bungalows.  
 In Kirby Hill there has been a lot of 
 houses built since 1960.              
  The main building material is brick  
 with tile roofs although several of   
 the older properties have roofs of    
 slate. One or two of the older and    
 more important houses are built of    
 stone, usually limestone. The houses  
 are mostly gathered together in the   
 three villages with an occasional     
 outlying farm.                        
 In Skelton most of the houses are     
 occupied by people who work in the    
 village for the Newby Hall Estate     
 which owns a lot of the property. In  
 Kirby Hill most of the people work    
 elsewhere and need transport.
