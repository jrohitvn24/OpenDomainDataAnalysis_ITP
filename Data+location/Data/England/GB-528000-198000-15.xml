		<content> Group as a whole as does the British  
 Steel Corporation.The Strayfield Road 
 factory has pattern shop facilities   
 for single or multiple patternss in   
 wood, resin or metal.The most popular 
 piece of equipment is the Niagia      
 screen but aa wide range of screens,  
 bunkers, washer barrels, conveyors,   
 feeders and associated supporting     
 structures can be supplied to suit any
 site condition specified.No job is too
 large or too small; installations have
 been undertaken in the most difficult 
 atmospheric conditions, ranging from  
 the hotest to the wettest and the     
 coldest parts of the world.To date the
 most expensive installation has been  
 one in N. Ireland for a Â£1million +   
 quarry installation which will process
 up to 560 tonnes per hour.Many of     
 these large orders carry heavy penalty
 clauses so work is planned carefully  </content>
