		<content>      Older Young People tend to join  
 the Young Farmers Club.This is a mixed
 club and as its name suggests is      
 primarily for young farmers. This     
 group meets twice a month usually in  
 the school during the winter but      
 outside at farms and other places of  
 interest during the summer following  
 activities such as stock judging etc. 
 During the winter they have visiting  
 speakers and demonstrators and hold   
 quizes and public speaking            
 competitions etc.                     
      The district is served by four   
 local pubs, only one is in our        
 rectangle but these play quite a major
 part in village life having men and   
 ladies darts teams, leek clubs, domino
 competitions and darts matches.Most of
 them also provide bar meals at a      
 reasonable price.
