		<content> The unit in which I work is part of   
 Weare School.During the day I work    
 with children from all the classes in 
 the main school. I hear some children 
 read and others I help with their     
 writing.Sometimes I help the teacher  
 in the classroom.                     
   At 3:30p.m.I leave school and go to 
 the supermarket in Cheddar to do some 
 shopping.By the time I get home it is 
 4:30p.m.and time to wake my husband.He
 is a policeman who often works at     
 night and so must  sleep in the       
 daytime.I make the supper which is    
 usually meat,potatoes,and vegetables  
 and collect Jackie from Axbridge.After
 supper I finish any housework.I hoover
 the carpets and wash the clothes.Later
 I go and help the Brownies work for   
 their badges.I enjoy playing games    
 with them too.At 10:30p.m. I go to bed
 to be ready for the next day.         </content>
