		<title>16SOUTHAMPTON AIRPORT HISTORY</title>
		<content> The 'founder' of Eastleigh Airfield   
 was Eric Rowland Moon who used the    
 meadows of North Stoneham Farm as a   
 flying field for his monoplane. He    
 achieved{flight}in his Moonbeam Mk.II 
 in 1910 and probably used the field as
 early as 1909.                        
 The USA{armed forces}used the{airport}
 during WW1. During 1920/21 shipping   
 companies took over the buildings as a
 trans-migrant centre and the name     
 changed to Atlantic Park. The site was
 bought by Southampton Corporation in  
 1929. The first flying club, Hampshire
 Aero Club, was established in 1933. In
 1935 there was increased activity for 
{tourism}especially to the Channel     
 Islands. 5, March, 1936 saw the maiden
{flight}of R.J.Mitchell's prototype    
 Spitfire. During WW2 the Admiralty    
 took over the airfield. On 15/5/1961  
 private enterprise took over.         </content>
