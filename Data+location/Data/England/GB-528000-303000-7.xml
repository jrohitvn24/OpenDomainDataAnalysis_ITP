		<title>07Thorney Attitudes To Youth</title>
		<content>    What do the people of{Thorney}think
 of{fashion}and{young people}in the    
 village? We decided to ask them. These
 are our results.                      
    Most people thought that young     
 people generally behave.  We asked the
 people in Thorney about{vandalism.    
 Most of the{youngsters}said that there
 is'nt a lot, but when there is it's a 
 pity. There were different tastes in  
{pop music,}but the favourite group was
{WHAM!}and most preferred{breakdance}  
 for dancing. They thought{fashion}in  
 Thorney is quite up to date,but not   
 too outrageous. We asked the younger  
 people what they thought of the older 
 people in Thorney. They said some are 
 a bit grumpy but most are very nice   
 and have lovely characters. We asked  
 the older people if they liked Thorney
{now}or in the past. They mostly said  
 they liked it how we live{today.      </content>
