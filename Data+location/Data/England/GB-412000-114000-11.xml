		<title>11Ashford Water Trout Farm.</title>
		<content>    Before there was a trout farm at   
{Ashford Water,}it was marshland. The  
 marsh had lots of{wildlife}such as    
 owls, nightjars and frogs. Now that   
 there is a trout farm there, the      
 wildlife has changed dramatically.    
 Today we see heron and kingfishers.   
 There are no frogs, nightjars or owls.
    The owner has fifteen ponds of     
 varied sized fish. He breeds the fish 
 himself and sells them when they are  
 about three years old. He sells the   
 fish to stock{fishing lakes.}He also  
 freezes some fish and gives some away 
 to his friends. He has eight sheep to 
 keep the grass down and a guard dog.  
    In the future the owner hopes to   
 build a house on the site now occupied
 by a caravan.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
