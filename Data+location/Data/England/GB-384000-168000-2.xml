		<title>02LEAFIELD ESTATE, CORSHAM</title>
		<content>  This industrial estate has been      
 developed over the last ten years.Some
 twenty factories provide work for many
 people. We visited several of the     
 factories including Kirk Dysons which 
 makes trade plastic mouldings.They    
 make 30,000 balls a year for          
 ballbarrows. They also make toilet    
 extensions for old people and hospital
 wards as well as plastic street       
 bins. It covers about 2 acres of land 
 and employs 27 people. They export to 
 France, Germany, Ireland, Singapore   
 and they import from Germany.         
 On another visit we went to Carfax    
 Waste Paper Factory which buys up all 
 kinds of waste paper, anything from   
 cardboard to cheque stubs. This is    
 sorted, cut up, baled and sold. The   
 factory can recycle paper up to 4     
 times and 1 tonne of cardboard equals 
 17 trees, we were told.               </content>
