		<content> This area, south of the Town of{      
{Winchcombe,}is drained by Beesmoor    
 Brook, Langley Brook and the River    
 Isbourne. The land rises southward    
 away from the centre of a natural bowl
 in which{Winchcombe}is situated.      
                                       
 As the land rises, geologists tell us 
 that it is made up of Middle Lias and 
 Upper Lias clays moving towards the   
 Inferior Oolite at Belas Knap. Springs
 emerge at the junction of the Upper   
 Lias and the limestone; deep valleys  
 have been cut by the R.Isbourne; ponds
 are formed where the underground water
 is high.(eg.Washpool)                 
                                       
 The oolitic limestone makes a superb  
 building material, being quarried in  
 the past around the Corndean area. It 
 is this stone that gives buildings in 
 this area their warm glowing tints.   </content>
