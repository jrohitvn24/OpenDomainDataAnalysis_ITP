		<title>04Suggitt's Ice-Cream.</title>
		<content>{ The Suggitts}have been making their  
 popular ice-cream since 1925.The      
 present Mr.Suggitt had a relative who 
 made it before him.The Suggitts used  
 to live on High Green in the 1930s and
 made their ice-cream out in their back
 garden although they still had their  
 old shop.Mr.Suggitt now lives in a    
 large house by the{River Leven.}Today 
 the shop also sells sweets,and a small
 cafe' owned by the Suggitts is a      
 popular addition.Suggitts white,creamy
 ice-cream is sold at quite reasonable 
 prices,and is popular with both       
 villagers and visitors alike.Aswell as
 the shop in the village,the Suggitts  
 have a van which covers quite a wide  
 area.A visit to Great Ayton,would not 
 be complete without sampling Suggitt's
 ice-cream.
