		<title>02Transport: Cobham, w. Strood</title>
		<content> Watling Street, an important Roman    
 road, now the A2, passes through the  
 area from London in the west to the   
 Medway Towns, then Canterbury and     
 Dover in the east. As the A2          
 approaches Strood, the M2 motorway    
 begins, taking transport to the south 
 and east, bypassing the Medway Towns. 
 Much of the heavier traffic takes     
 advantage of this motorway, especially
 between the capital and the Channel   
 ports.                                
 The rural nature of Cobham Park means 
 there are  many public footpaths but  
 very few roads within an area of some 
 five square kilometres.               
 Bus services for residents into the   
 Medway Towns from western Strood are  
 quite extensive.
