		<title>03The Local Landscape</title>
		<content> The landscape is full of things to    
 see, trees, fields, hills and         
 different kinds of buildings. The     
 fields are pretty colours and are all 
 shapes and sizes like a patchwork.I   
 sometimes take a pencil and a piece of
 paper and go and draw the landscape.I 
 look at all the houses and sometimes I
 see a ruined one.                     
                                       
 There are lots of pretty things to see
 in the hedgerows round the fields,    
 flowers and small creatures. When I   
 look up and around I can see farm     
 buildings and cows. The fields are all
 different colours. Some are green but 
 they are not all the same green, some 
 are yellow and some are brown. The    
 farmers grow wheat, oats and barley.  
                                       
 The landscape is a very beautiful     
 thing to look at.                     </content>
