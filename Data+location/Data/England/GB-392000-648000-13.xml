		<title>13Longridge Estate</title>
		<content> House,grounds,lodges,stables etc, were
 bought by Capt. Collingwood Thompson, 
 and the house let to Miss Gordon-Smith
 Who turned it into a girls school,    
 boarders,weekly boarders and day-girls
 and the Collingwood Thompsons moved   
 into the stables.Because of high      
 running costs,in 1939 the school moved
 to more viable accomodation and the   
 army took over for the duration of the
 1939_45 war.When released,the building
 was bought by a consortium of business
 men,turned into an hotel without      
 success and again sold to a Catholic  
 Order,who transferred their school    
 from Berwick.It was run successfully  
 until 1982,during which time a Chapel 
 and swimming pool were built.         
  The Nuns,who were a popular part of  
 the local community,had to leave      
 the area because of a lack of teaching
 nuns and its closure was regretted.   </content>
