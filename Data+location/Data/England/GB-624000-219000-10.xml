		<title>10HOUSING DEVELOPMENT</title>
		<content> All coastal adjacent sites in         
 Frinton-on-sea and Walton-on-Naze have
 been filled,with the exception of the 
 Greensward,and development is also    
 restricted to the north of Walton by  
 the marshes,which prevent further     
 construction. Most of the inland      
 building sites which are available are
 being utilised.                       
   The area is experiencing much recent
 housing development and its associated
 pressures.                            
   Frinton's expansion external to the 
 railway gates includes the present day
 estates of Heronsgate,Walden          
 Way,Newport Way,Rochford Way and      
 Branscombe Close.                     
   Estate developments in Walton, such 
 as Rainham Way, Butchers Lane and Wade
 Reach, reached 8 units per acre, many 
 of these being bungalows, as opposed  
 to the 6 units per acre in Frinton.   </content>
