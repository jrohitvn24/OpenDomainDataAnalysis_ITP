to suit every interest.Many of these   
are connected to the churches.For      
instance,the church has a good choir   
and a team of campanologists;there is a
sunday school and a Mothers' union.    
 The Great Central Railway Enthusiasts 
Club meets in the social club on the   
second Wednesday in every month to see 
films and slides of steam locomotives  
and to talk generally about the age of 
steam.For the young there are Girl     
Guides and Brownies,Scouts and Cubs.   
  A History Society was formed 30 years
ago.It has aroused a great deal of     
interest in the village.Meetings are   
held once a month in the community     
centre and usually attract some 30     
people.Subjects include archaeology,   
antiques,Roman coins etc.as well as    
local History.Visits to places of
