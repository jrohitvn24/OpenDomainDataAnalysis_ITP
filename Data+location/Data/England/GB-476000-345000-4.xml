		<content> Firs Farm has changed in the past     
 years,there used to be 6-7 small      
 fields but now there is one big one.  
 The tractors couldn't get through the 
 small gates so the farmer cut down all
 the hedgerows and made all the small  
 fields in to a big one.Another thing  
 was,there used to be big barns made   
 from brick but now to save money      
 people use metal,plastic or wood.In   
 the fields of Graham Walker there used
 to be clay drains.Nowadays farmers    
 have plastic drains because they are  
 cheaper.Mr Walker grows all sorts of  
 crops.There's wheat,barley,potatoes   
 and a new crop called linseed.A daily 
 routine for Mr Walker is something the
 weather decides.If it rains, indoor   
 jobs are done but if the weather stays
 fine, outdoor jobs are done.The bit Mr
 Walker likes about farming is the open
 air.He has 350 acres of land.         </content>
