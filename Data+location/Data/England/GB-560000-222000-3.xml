 At school we can have school dinners  
 or sandwiches.When the bell goes we   
 line up and then we go into the hall. 
 We have to go into the kitchen to get 
 our dinner.We have 10 points in all.We
 have four points for our main course, 
 we can have ham or eggs or choppy or  
 cheese or fish fingers.My favourite is
 choppy.Then we choose a vegetable it  
 is 2 points,we can have potato or rice
 The next thing to choose is 2 points, 
 we can have peas or cabbage or baked  
 beans or beans or salad.For our last  
 course we can choose cake or meringue 
 or jelly or a drink.I like my dinners.</content>
