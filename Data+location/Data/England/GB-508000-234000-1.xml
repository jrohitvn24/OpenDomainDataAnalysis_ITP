		<content> This area is mainly agricultural with 
 two villages, Upper Gravenhurst and   
 part of Silsoe,  the hamlet of Lower  
 Gravenhurst , Wrest Park, Cainhoe     
 Manor, the Mill near Gravenhurst and  
 several scattered farms. The land is  
 mainly heavy clay soil on rolling     
 hills and valleys with small woods and
 copses here and there. The young River
 Flit runs through the valley at the   
 extreme eastern edge of the block, and
 small streams join it at intervals.   
 Roads are winding and narrow except   
 for the A6 by-pass Luton to Bedford,  
 round Silsoe. Although there is no    
 part of great beauty, the area is     
 pleasantly rural, a quiet and peaceful
 place in  which to live and work.     
 Public transport is not frequently    
 available so most inhabitants rely on 
 using their own cars. The area is     
 typical example of rural Bedfordshire.</content>
