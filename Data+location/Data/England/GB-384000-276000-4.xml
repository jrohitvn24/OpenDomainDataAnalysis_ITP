		<title>04HURCOTT VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>      {Hurcott Village}has been created
 out of one of the oldest sites in     
 British papermaking history dating    
 back to the Middle Ages.It was owned  
 by the Earls of Dudley and paper was  
 hand made by monks.By 1635 it was     
 owned by Thomas Blount and paper      
 making continued on the site until    
 1973 when it was closed due to modern 
 technological competition.It was then 
 used as a furniture store but a       
 disastrous fire ,causing the deaths of
 local firemen, destroyed a great part 
 of the original buildings.            
      These have now been rebuilt into 
 a modern development beside the old   
 mill pool surrounded by fields and    
 trees but convenient to the town.     
      The pool is an attraction for    
 wild life and a good place for        
 fishing.
