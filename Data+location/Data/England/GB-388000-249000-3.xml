		<title>03An Inhabitant of Stoulton</title>
		<content>     Mary, who is fifty-seven years old
 was born in Stoulton, and went to     
 school there until she was seven years
 old.  She met her husband in the      
 village and they have two children, a 
 boy and a girl, who are both married. 
 One lives in Kempsey, the other in    
 Worcester, both of them were          
 christened and married in Stoulton    
 like herself.  She has four           
 grandchildren, two boys and two girls.
     Mary used to belong to the Womens 
 Institute, but she was unable to be a 
 regular member after her father became
 bedridden.   He was well-known among  
 the villagers for his prize-winning   
 vegetables and died aged eighty-seven.
     Mary lives in a council house     
 opposite what used to be the local    
 smithy and she feels there has been   
 little change in Stoulton over the    
 years.                                </content>
