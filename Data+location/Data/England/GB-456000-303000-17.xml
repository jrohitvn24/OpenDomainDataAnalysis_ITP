		<title>17Leicester Holiday Fortnight</title>
		<content> In the city of Leicester there is an  
{industrial fortnights holiday}for the 
{first two weeks of July.}Most         
 factories close down completely,      
 consequently, as most people are away 
 the schools begin their summer        
 holidays at the beginning of July.    
 During the{July fortnight}the city    
 centre stores hold their{summer sales.
 The{bus services}into the city centre 
 are very{restricted}as there are so   
 few passengers.                       
 The{East coast}is a popular holiday   
 destination for many Leicester people.
{Skegness, Hunstanton}and{Mablethorpe} 
 are very popular. At Mablethorpe there
 is the{Leicester Children's Holiday   
{Home.}It is a{charity run home}for    
 poor, neglected children of the city. 
 The only charge the children are asked
 to make for a fortnights holiday is   
 towards transport costs.              </content>
