		<title>06A SICK STORY</title>
		<content> I woke up at 4.30 a.m. &amp; felt sick. I 
 sat up &amp; read till 5.30. Suddenly I   
 was sick, called for Mum but Dad came.
 He got me some water in glucose &amp; I   
 went back to sleep. I woke up at 7.30 
 to hear my Mum saying, 'Wakey-Wakey!  
 How are you feeling, oh you look aw-  
 ful!' I told her I felt awful. She    
 told me to keep quiet &amp; go back to    
 sleep. I felt I was going to die but  
 fortunately I didn't. When my Mum had 
 taken Mark to school she came back to 
 see me. She brought up a bowl with her
 &amp; it was just in time! I slept most of
 the day, when I woke up it was 4.00.  
 Mum bathed my head with something cold
 A schoolfriend came with my{Domesday  
{work}but I was sick so she had to go. 
 I lay on the settee &amp; dozed off. Later
 I felt better, had a biscuit &amp; drink &amp;
 was sick yet again. I went to bed at  
 7.30 hoping to feel better next day.  </content>
