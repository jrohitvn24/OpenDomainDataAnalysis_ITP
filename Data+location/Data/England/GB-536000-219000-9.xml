		<content>  St. Edmund's College was founded in  
 1793 after the refugees from the      
 English College at Douai (founded in  
 1568) were expelled from France and   
 joined the school at Old Hall Green   
 (founded in 1769).The main college    
 buildings were constructed in 1798/9. 
 The College remained both a school and
 seminary until 1915 when the latter   
 moved to Chelsea.                     
  The College has 520 boys and girls   
 from eight to eighteen years of age.It
 comprises of St.Hugh's (boys 8-13),   
 Junior House (boys and girls 11-13),  
 five senior boy's houses and one      
 senior girl's House.All houses are    
 mixed - both day and boarding         
 students.A broad curriculum of        
 academic and creative arts subjects is
 followed through to 'O' level,with a  
 high percentage following on to 'A'   
 level and higher education prospects. </content>
