		<title>02CHURCHES IN HOLT (PART ONE)</title>
		<content> There has been some kind of church in 
 Holt since the 14th Century, but St.  
 Katharine's Church dates back to the  
 19th Century. St. Katharine's is a    
 Church of England Church. There are   
 three buildings in Holt which have    
 been vicarages; this is the reason    
 why. The first vicarage was on The    
 Green and it was occupied by a        
 bachelor vicar. He got engaged to     
 a girl whose family owned Harvey's    
 Bristol Cream (a sherry company). Her 
 parents thought that the vicarage was 
 too small, so St. Katharine's House   
 was built. Later, the church          
 commisioners decided that many        
 vicarages were too big to keep, so    
 they built another, smaller one, in   
 the grounds of St. Katharine's House. 
 There are two churches in Holt because
 there were Christians who didn't wish 
 to belong to the official Church.     </content>
