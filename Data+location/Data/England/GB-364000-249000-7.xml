		<content> An interesting development in this    
 area has been the setting up of small 
 businesses.  There is now a rope maker
 and repairer who makes and repairs    
 ropes for many churches in the        
 country, and is currently engaged in  
 work for St. Thomas', Salisbury, and  
 Pershore Abbey.  Not far from him we  
 find a furniture designer and maker.  
 In the small village of Munderfield   
 there is an antique furniture         
 business which was set up six months  
 ago, and a gunsmith.  This gunsmiths  
 was started by a man from Birmingham  
 with his two sons.  While they sell   
 and repair guns, his wife runs the    
 village shop and post office.  There  
 is also a builder working in the      
 village.
