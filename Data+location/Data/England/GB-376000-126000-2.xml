		<content>    In our area there are a number of  
 small businesses and some people are  
 self-employed. Most people work on    
 farms. Lots of ladies are housewives  
 and some people are builders.         
    In the village of Milton there is a
 post office where the owners live and 
 work. There is a garage with the post 
 office which also sells sweets,       
 vegetables, fruit and tinned food.    
    In this area there are no factories
 although there are two nurseries; one 
 in Milton and one in Wyke. There is   
 one public house but no restaurants.  
    There are ten farms in the area,so 
 there is quite a lot of employment for
 farm workers.
