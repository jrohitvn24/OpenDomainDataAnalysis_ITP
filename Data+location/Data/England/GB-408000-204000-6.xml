		<title>06RIVER COLN IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> The River Coln is a 6m wide fast      
 flowing freshwater river which flows  
 through the centre of Bibury. It was  
 originally used for washing the wool  
 and for household uses. Nowadays,     
 water is pumped out at the rate of a  
 million gallons a day into a reservoir
 at Faringdon where it is purified for 
 use as drinking water. The water is   
 also used for cattle, fishing and as a
 general amenity. The river is a great 
 tourist attraction and every day there
 is some-one there even when it is     
 snowing.                              
 Next to the river is Rack Isle a wet  
 grassland conservation area where     
 mallards,moorhens,coots and mute swans
 can nest. In the river are brown      
 trout, rainbow trout, graylings,      
 golden orf, tadpoles and frogs and    
 water voles and water rats which live 
 in the embankments.                   </content>
