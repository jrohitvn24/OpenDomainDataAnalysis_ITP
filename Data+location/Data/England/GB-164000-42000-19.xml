		<title>19Tehidy Woods.</title>
		<content> Part of{Tehidy Woods}is being         
 developed into a{Country Park.}For    
 two years the 12 people who are       
 employed at the{woods}have been making
 it safe by building new{stiles}and    
{fences}and rebuilding old ones which  
 are in poor condition.Another thing   
 that is happening is they are draining
 the lake so the water will flow easily
 and it will stay clean.The only plan  
 for the{lake}is to stock it with{fish 
 so water{birds}will nest there.Old    
{trees}have been cut down and many new 
 ones have been planted.At the moment  
 only a few people visit the{woods}now 
 and again.The{Country Park}will be    
 open to the public some time in       
 1990.It will be open seven days a week
 and there will be no admission fee.   
 People will be able to ride{horses}and
 take their pet{dogs}into the{Country  
{Park.                                 </content>
