		<content> I wake up in the morning, wash and    
 then dress. I go down for my breakfast
 and wash the dishes. l get my pack    
 lunch ready and wait for Mary Trick.  
 When she comes we get in her car and  
 she drops us off at Park Rd. We walk  
 up Dean St. and into school. The bell 
 goes and l come in and read my book.  
 Then we do maths. Then the bell goes  
 and then we go out to play. We do     
 English for an hour. Then we do P.E.at
 12.30pm it's Gymnastics. Then some of 
 us go out to our D.blocks. After about
 another hour or two we go home. My mum
 picks us up at Cockles Rise, then we  
 go home and watch television. We have 
 our tea and go out to play at 7.30.   
 Then l go in and go to bed at 8.00.
