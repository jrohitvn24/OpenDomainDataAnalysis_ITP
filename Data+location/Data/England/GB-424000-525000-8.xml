		<title>08THE LOLLIPOP MAN.</title>
		<content>    On a morning at about 8.20a.m. Mr. 
 Bell starts work. He guides us across 
 the road. He stands near the fence at 
 our school and we wait for him to come
 across the road. He wears a big, white
 coat and a hat. When it is raining or 
 when it is snowing he never fails to  
 come. When he is tired and weary he is
 still there every morning.            
    When he is sick, a policeman comes.
 The policeman stops the traffic by    
 holding up his arm but Mr. Bell stops 
 the traffic by holding up his lollipop
 which is a big piece of metal with a  
 sign at the top saying STOP CHILDREN. 
    Mr. Bell started to work here on   
 17th March, 1980. At the end of term  
 he gives us sweets and a packet of    
 lollies. He is the kindest, nicest    
 lollipop man in the whole wide world.
