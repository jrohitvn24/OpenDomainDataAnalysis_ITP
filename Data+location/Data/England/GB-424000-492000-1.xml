		<content> This is a rolling agricultural area   
 bisected by the A1 trunk road (the    
 main London to Edinburgh road which   
 follows the route of the Roman Dere   
 Street).                              
     There is little high land and most
 of the fields are cultivated though   
 some are grazing land for sheep or    
 cattle.The main crops grown are       
 cereals,potatoes and grass for hay or 
 silage.                               
     Hackforth Village is the largest  
 settlement having about 40 houses and 
 a population of about 120.Here there  
 is a school,village hall,public house 
 and a sub-post office/shop.           
     Ainderby Mires and Gyll Hall are  
 farmhouses of historic interest.On the
 east side of the A1 road there is a   
 stud farm and a haulage contractor.   
                                       
                                       </content>
