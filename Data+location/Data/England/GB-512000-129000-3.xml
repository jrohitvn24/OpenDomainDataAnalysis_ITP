		<content>   There are varied opinions on the    
 different aspects of the Broad Oak    
 Estate and the new Laing Houses.      
   The residents who live on the       
 Guildford road next to the Industrial 
 Estate find that their road is much   
{quieter}and{safer}now that all the    
 traffic is diverted around the        
 by-pass.One of the residents,at first,
 was not used to the quietness. The    
 manufacture of perfume at the Estate  
 produces an{aroma}which some of the   
 residents object to but some enjoy.   
   The buildings in the Estate{shelter 
 the houses from westerly winds. The   
 lights from the Estate and those from 
 a nearby garage provide{security.     
   One resident complained that there  
 used to be a green field next to her  
 so she is against the new Laing Houses
 which are now next door. She has      
 applied for a rates reduction.        </content>
