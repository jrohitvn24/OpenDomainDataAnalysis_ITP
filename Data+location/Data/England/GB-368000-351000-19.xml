		<content> In our area, there are six pubs. The  
 Elephant and Castle and The Horseshoe 
 were farms until the mid-19th         
 century,but were changed when the     
 Newcastle road (A52) became a main    
 road. The White Hart, also on the A52,
 served as a mill before it was a pub. 
 The Raven was purpose-built for the   
 Brookhouse estate. The Cheshire Cheese
 and The Vine were built for local     
 communities, but the estate near the  
 Cheshire Cheese never materialised.   
 The present owners put on musical     
 entertainment each evening to attract 
 customers, staying open till midnight 
 on weekdays. For those interested in  
 pool there is a Sunday-evening club at
 the Cheshire Cheese, and              
 remote-control car enthusiasts should 
 visit the Vine on a Sunday morning or 
 Wednesday evening.
