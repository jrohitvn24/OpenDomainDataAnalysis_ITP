		<content>  Farms have large ranges of buildings 
 for housing crops,stock and implements
 during the winter months,all farms    
 have mains electricity,and although   
 some have private water supplies from 
 wells or boreholes,most are connected 
 to mains water supply.                
   Up to threequarters of the land will
 be ploughed and cultivated this year  
 for crop production.Major crops grown 
 are Winter and Spring Barley,Winter   
 Wheat,Oil Seed Rape,Potatoes,Oats,Peas
 and Swedes for stock feed.The farms   
 are famous like the rest of Tweedside 
 for producing good quality malting    
 barley.During the last few years more 
 crops such as Wheat,Barley and Oil    
 Seed Rapehave been planted in the     
 Autumn,this has the advantage of      
 spreading the work load away from     
 Springtime,and also allows for an     
 earlier start to the harvest.         </content>
