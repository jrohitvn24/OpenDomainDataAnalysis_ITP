		<title>01THE LIE OF THE LAND</title>
		<content> This part of the survey is situated   
 in the South-East corner of the Wirral
 Penisular and lies on gently sloping  
 land rising for the south - west.It   
 is situated at the very end of a      
 shallow sandstone ridge which extends 
 in a north - westerly direction as far
 as Birkenhead.                        
                                       
 To the west of the area the land rolls
 gently down into an ice cut valley    
 which extends to the north west and   
 the Wirral coast.                     
                                       
 The natural vegetation of this block  
 might best be decribed as marsh with  
 scrub,much of that made up by Silver  
 Birch.Today it most difficult to find 
 any remains of this as most of the    
 area has either been aquired for      
 houses or is now intensively farmed.
