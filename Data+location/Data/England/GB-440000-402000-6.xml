		<title>06Low Valley Farm</title>
		<content> Low Valley farm is about 300 years    
 old. It has got about 82 acres of     
 land. The farm is rented from the Coal
 Board and Middlewood Hall Trust. The  
 present farmers have lived on the     
 farm for 29 years.The only animals    
 kept on the farm are heifers and      
 calves. They have 6 tractors and      
 numerous pieces of machinery. A lot of
 damage is done by vandals. They start 
 fires and throw rubbish in the fields.
 One cow swallowed some litter and     
 died.                                 
   They use the land for grazing and   
 crops. They grow barley and wheat. The
 grain is ground for cattle food. The  
 Mine opposite will soon be closed and 
 the site will be returned to farmland,
 making the farm 150 acres.The farmer  
 is hoping to continue to live here but
 the N.C.B.may put the land up for     
 sale.                                 </content>
