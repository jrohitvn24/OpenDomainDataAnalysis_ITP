		<title>03River Dart at Staverton</title>
		<content> The river here is not navigable except
 for very small craft and the rafts    
 that career down stream from          
 Buckfastleigh to Totnes each year for 
 local charities.  There are two       
 bridges ;Riverford and Staverton.The  
 two weirs were built by salmon        
 fishermen and the deep weir pools     
 provide good sport. The rights here   
 are leased to Blake Sports ,Totnes ,a 
 daily ticket costing Â£5.The Water     
 Bailiff tries to stop all unofficial  
 fishing.Most of the year the river    
 flows gently under Staverton Bridge   
 but after winter snows it is often a  
 raging torrent some 5 or 6 feet deeper
 with all sorts of debris bashing the  
 piers of the bridge.Swans and many    
 other water birds live on this        
 reach.Occasionally we see the lovely  
 Kingfisher flitting by. This is a     
 place for naturalists and artists.    </content>
