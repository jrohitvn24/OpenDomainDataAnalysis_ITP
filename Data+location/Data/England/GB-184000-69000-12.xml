		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LISA</title>
		<content> At between 6 am and 7 am I wake up.I  
 then get dressed and washed. Next I   
 brush my hair and I go and have my    
 breakfast.Then I generally mess about 
 until 8.25 am. I then find my shoes,  
 coat and schoolbag.After that I go    
 down the road to call for my friend.We
 then go up the road to call for my    
 other friend.When she is ready we walk
 to school.Once we're in school we     
 usually do Maths and English and      
 sometimes we go into the hall for     
 Assembly.At 10.30 am we have play-time
 which lasts for a quarter hour and at 
 12.00 pm it is dinner-time.Once we've 
 had dinner we play 'till l.l5 pm.Then 
 we do some more work and at 3.l5 pm it
 is home-time. At home at 4.15 pm we   
 usually have tea then I watch the     
 television until 9.00 pm when I get   
 changed, brush my teeth and go to bed.
