		<title>14VEHICLE TESTING,IPSWICH</title>
		<content> All major towns have a place where    
lorries and vans are tested to see if  
they are safe to drive on public roads.
The Vehicle Testing Station on Landseer
Road is run by the Minstry of          
Transport.                             
  Here, lorries are given a very       
demanding test to see if they have     
sound brakes,tyres, lights etc. Highly 
sensitive, computerised machinery, in  
the hands of an experienced worker,    
will determine if the vehicle is fit   
to travel on the roads around Ipswich. 
  The buildings and large parking areas
are only 1km from the docks and factory
areas, an ideal position as much of the
local traffic is that of lorries and   
vans.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
