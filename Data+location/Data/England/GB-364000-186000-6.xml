		<title>06TYTHERINGTON QUARRY</title>
		<content> The Company that owns Tytherington    
 Quarry is{AMEY ROADSTONE CORPORATION  
{(A.R.C.).}The Quarry is about 100_120 
 acres. At the middle of the quarry 250
 ft down on the 5th shelf is a large   
 pool of water which collects in       
 the quarry. Two million gallons of    
 water is pumped out every day. To     
 excavate the stone is blasted off the 
 face twice a day, with the result 8_9 
 thousand tons of carboniferous        
 limestone is brought down. Roads      
 around the quarry are closed and      
 traffic stopped. After the blasting   
 stone is taken to the crusher,it is   
 tipped down the shoot and goes on a   
 conveyer belt. Large hammers smash the
 stone into smaller pieces. The main   
 problems for the quarry are water and 
 possible harm to local areas.
