		<content>{ Walsall Road}is the most important   
 road serving Darlaston. All Saints    
 Church, originally given by the Mills 
 family (ironmasters) in 1872 was      
 destroyed by bombing in 1942, no one  
 was killed but only a crater remained.
 The{war damage commision}gave Â£28,320 
 and the parish Â£10,000 - the present  
 church was opened in 1942. The vicar  
 spends half his time as an industrial 
 chaplain and the{council of churches} 
 is much concerned with levels of      
 unemployment -{21,000 worked in the}  
{mid 70's now only 2,500.}The Methodist
 Church (1807) is very active in the   
 area. With factory closures more open 
 spaces are appearing to add to the    
 pleasant cemetery in Fallings Heath;  
 Kings Hill Park, and the large group  
 of allotments near the Black Horse.   
 There is now a distinctive Asian style
 to the shops off Walsall Road         </content>
