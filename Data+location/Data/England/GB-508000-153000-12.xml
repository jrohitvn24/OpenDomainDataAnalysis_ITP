		<content>   There are two drama groups in       
 Horsley:{The Nomads,}so called because
 they used to perform in various places
 but now have their own theatre, and   
 the{WHIPS}(West Horsley Institute     
 Productions)who have always performed 
 in the West Horsley village hall.     
   There are three age groups within   
 each club:The Whips have the{Whippets}
 (12 years old and under),{Young Whips}
 (13_18 years old) and the{Whips}(19+).
 The Nomads have the{Young Nomes, Nomes
 and the{Nomads,}with similar age      
{groups}to the Whips.Both groups have  
 to make their own scenery for their   
 productions which occur about 3 times 
 a year.If all age groups are included 
 there could be as many as{6  }        
{productions per year. }
