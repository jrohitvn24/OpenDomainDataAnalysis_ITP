		<content>     Jeans, sweat shirts, trainers and 
 lightweight jackets are the most      
 popular clothes in 1985 for young men.
 For women the most popular clothes are
 jumpers, high heel shoes and skirts.  
 The length of a skirt is just above or
 just below the knees.                 
   Clothes cost a lot of money.  For   
 instance, a good child's pair of jeans
 cost Â£9.99 and a girl's lime coloured 
 summer dress Â£6.99.  Some people wear 
 very brightly coloured, almost        
 flourescent socks, belts and head and 
 wrist bands in yellow, red, green and 
 pink.                                 
   There are also fashions for hair.   
 Some people in their teens have their 
 hair almost shaved off of have it dyed
 different colours like red, green or  
 blue.  But most people just have their
 hair cut to different lengths with    
 females wearing theirs longer.        </content>
