		<content> There are not many opportunities for  
 employment.  Farming is the principal 
 occupation, supplemented by the few   
 small businesses listed, e.g. market  
 garden, haulage, agricultural         
 workshops, camp and caravan site, dog 
 kennels, plant hire and landscape     
 contractor and storekeeping in the six
 hangars - relics from the second world
 war dispersed airfields.  Some of the 
 inhabitants work at RAPRA or RAF      
 Shawbury, and others at the nearby    
 MOTEC establishment.  Farmers tend to 
 train their sons - usually the eldest 
 - to take over some of their duties,  
 and eventually all of them.  Most     
 farms now are gradually reducing their
 work force due to mechanisation.
