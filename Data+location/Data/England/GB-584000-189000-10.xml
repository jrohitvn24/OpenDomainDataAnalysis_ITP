		<title>10Employment in Rochford Area.</title>
		<content> Approximately 20% of the people who   
 live in the Rochford area have a      
 managerial or a professional job.     
 50% have manual jobs, some skilled and
 some semi-skilled. The rest are       
 somewhere between the two.  A lot of  
 people in the area go to London to    
 work.  Some travel by train (Rochford 
 or Hockley Stations) and some travel  
 by car or even coach.  About 20% of   
 the population work in London.  The   
 rest of the people, unless they are   
 unemployed, work mainly in Essex.     
 Nearly 25% go to work in Southend     
 which is three to four miles away,    
 depending on where you live.  Another 
 nearly 10% work in Basildon where     
 there are many big industries,        
 including the Ford Motor Company.     
 Basildon is approximately eight miles 
 away.  These people travel either by  
 public transport or use their own car.</content>
