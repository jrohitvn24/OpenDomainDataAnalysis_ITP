		<content> The Methodist Church came to Sellindge
 in 1883 when Mr.J.W.Andrew,a          
 Colporteur,wished to provide the      
 opportunity in the village for non-   
 conformist worship.Initially meetings 
 were held in Thomas Rigden's barn.A   
 Mr.Coke,a local preacher,was shepherd 
 to Mr. Rigden and the result of this  
 relationship was the building of the  
 Chapel,paid for by Mr. Rigden.It was  
 built by Mr.Cambourne of Folkestone in
 1883 for Â£1,264 5s 8d, including      
 furnishings,on its present site 150   
 yards East of the Parish Church on the
 South side of the main A20 road.The   
 Chapel is part of the Folkestone      
 circuit and the present Minister is   
 Rev.Tom Allen B.D.who lives in Hythe. 
 Officers of the Chapel include Mr.&amp;   
 Mrs.Shorter,she being the organist.   
 Services are well attended and the    
 Chapel is thriving.                   </content>
