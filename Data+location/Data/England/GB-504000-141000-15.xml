 are given transport by Surrey County  
 Council where they live more than 3   
 miles from nearest appropriate school.
                                       
 INDEPENDANT SCHOOLS: None.  Many      
 children in this area go to private   
 schools.  Cranleigh School only about 
 5 miles away takes day boys from this 
 area and girls in the Sixth Form.     
 There are other schools in the area   
 that also serve as day schools.       
 Many other children go away to        
 boarding schools.
