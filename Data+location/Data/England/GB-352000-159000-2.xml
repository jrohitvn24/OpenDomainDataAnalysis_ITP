		<content> Population 163 - 1981 census. The     
 village consists of a few cottages    
 clustered round the Church, 4 council 
 houses, a few of houses below Breach  
 Hill, and some larger properties and 8
 farms scattered among the hills. The  
 twisty lanes fall eventually down to  
 Blagdon Lake (Yeo Reservoir) to the   
 S.W. The curious name of the village  
 is derived from Emnett (Old English)  
 meaning "plain" and Throb-well, a     
 "gushing stream". It does not conform 
 to the modern idea of a "plain", being
 hilly, but gushing streams certainly, 
 especially in wet weather. The name   
 possibly refers to{Pixie Hole,}once a 
 narrow gully of rushing water, now a  
 steep lane running from Dew Down to   
 Ubley. The area must once have been an
 ancient settlement. To the west there 
 is a{Neolithic Longbarrow,}known for  
 some curious reson as{"Fairy Tootes".}</content>
