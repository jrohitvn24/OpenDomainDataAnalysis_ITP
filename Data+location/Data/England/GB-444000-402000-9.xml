		<title>09THE NEW BRIDGE AT BOLTON</title>
		<content> The bridge is at{Furlong Road,}Bolton.
 The old bridge was about 90 years old 
 and developed downward fractures.  The
 125 trains were too heavy for it      
 because it was build for lighter      
 trains.  The works department of the  
 railway board at Sheffield are        
 responsible for the new bridge with   
 some sub-contractors.  The bridge has 
 expansion gaps in the centre part     
 which weighs about{350 tonnes}and is  
 made of prefabricated reinforced      
 concrete blocks.  Fitters, joiners,   
 plasterers and all sorts of           
 construction machinery have been used.
 Rail-traffic was only stopped for     
 about two days during construction but
 single lane road traffic has operated 
 many times during the{thirteen months}
 it has taken to build the bridge.  The
 slopes at the side of the bridge are  
 being landscaped by Harrisons.        </content>
