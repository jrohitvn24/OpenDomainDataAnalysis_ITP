		<content>{  WANSBROUGH PAPER MILL}              
 In Wansbrough Paper Mill they make    
 brown and white paper. 220 men work   
 there and 30 women. They make         
 envelopes, paper bags, wallpaper,     
 sugar bags and paper for packaging.   
 They are open 7 days a week and 10    
 days off at Christmas. They have two  
 cooks. The paper goes to the Midlands.
 They have 25 lorries owned by Griggs  
 and 75 trailers. They got 2 million   
 pounds in 1984. The lorries carry 20  
 tonnes. They have got two big         
 machines. They gave us a drink and    
 something to eat. Once the paper mill 
 was owned by some Americans but now it
 is owned by English people. The paper 
 mill is very dangerous because of the 
 hot wax they have and it is very big.
