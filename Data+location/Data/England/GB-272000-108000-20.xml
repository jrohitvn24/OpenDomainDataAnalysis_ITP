{routes}between Exeter and Barnstaple, 
 right in the middle of the country.   
 Seven {trains}run each day to and from
 Exeter and the return fare is Â£3,     
 while  six trains go to Barnstaple    
 with the fare Â£3.50.Two {buses}go to  
 and from Exeter each day and the      
 return fare is 85p, while the fare is 
 Â£1.20 to Barnstaple.it takes about    
 half an hour by {train}or {bus}to     
 Exeter and 45 minutes to Barnstaple.  
 Most people travel by {car}though, and
 only two families in our school do not
 have a car.The {main road}to Exeter   
 was built in 1825 when it was a toll  
 road and the {railway}was laid in     
 1855.
