		<content>When I was 3 years old,I went to       
Whitgreave Nursery School.On my first  
day I wasn't looking forward to going.I
can remember I was crying because my   
mom had to leave.Every one was friendly
to me but I just said nothing,not even 
"hello", I just smiled.First of all my 
friends and teachers introduced        
themselves to me,and then at last I    
told them my name.We started the day by
having a hymn.Then I had some biscuits 
and milk.I also remember there was a   
bunk bed.I use to climb the ladder and 
jump on the bed.I usually banged my    
head on the ceiling! I enjoyed myself  
that day playing with the toys and     
paints.There was also a sand pit.I was 
very naughty because I threw sand at my
friends.I didn't want to go back home  
again.I said goodbye to my friends and 
teachers.Then my mom came to take me   
home.I told her what happened that day.</content>
