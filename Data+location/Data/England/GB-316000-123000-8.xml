		<title>08Fideoak Transmission Station</title>
		<content>   This CEGB Transmission Station was  
 opened in 1957. It deals with both the
 400 000 volt National Grid lines and  
 the local networks at 132 000 volts or
 less; it covers about 35 acres and is 
 an important centre in the South-West 
 network.                              
   Little change is envisaged over the 
 next ten to fifteen years except in   
 the area of technical development.  As
 pieces of equipment wear out they are 
 replaced with modern, electronic      
 designs which are smaller and usually 
 cheaper (unless they have to be       
 specially produced for the system).   
   The new technology is reducing the  
 work load so that there are between   
 five and ten fewer jobs each year.    
 Today the station employs about       
 seventy people, many local. Jobs are  
 management engineering, fault finding,
 administration, and maintenance.      </content>
