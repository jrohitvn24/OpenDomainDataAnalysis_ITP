		<content> There was a mill on this site in the  
  fourteenth centuary.                 
 It was used for various purposes.     
 It was a corn mill,a pulling mill for 
 wool and in the fifteenth centuary    
 it became a paper mill.               
 In 1788 it became Thomas Cookes.      
 The name was transfered from Yorkshire
 by Thomas Lumb.He was such a hard     
 man that he was said to have been     
 quarried not born.                    
 It made hand made paper out of cotton 
 and rags.                             
 It now makes specialised paper from   
 wood pulp imported from Europe.       
 It employs about two hundred and      
 fifty people some work shift hours to 
 keep the mill running round the       
 clock.It shuts down on Sunday for     
 maintance.Their future is             
 optimistic.They have recenttly        
 invested heavily.                     </content>
