		<content>    In my spare time I clean the house 
 and do the dishes and if I still have 
 a lot of time I go to the swimming    
 baths.   Sometimes I watch television 
 or take my sisters out to play.  We   
 might play in the back garden, on the 
 swings or go to the park.  Sometimes  
 my brother lends me his bike and then 
 my friends get theirs.  We can ride to
 the van (a mobile shop) where we can  
 buy sweets or we ride round the houses
 and squares.   Most times we play up  
 and down the street.   At 8 o'clock I 
 go indoors to watch television and I  
 go to bed at about 11 o'clock.   I am 
 very happy.              Lesley Miller
