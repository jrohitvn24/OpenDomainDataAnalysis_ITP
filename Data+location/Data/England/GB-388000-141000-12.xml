		<title>12THE RIVER WYLYE</title>
		<content>   My Dad is a River Keeper on the     
 River Wylye.In the winter he cuts out 
 the weeds and pulls out mud banks to  
 make a gravel bed for the brown trout 
 to spawn.  In the spring he puts in   
 brown trout which have been reared in 
 big tanks.  He also cuts the water    
 weeds in the spring to make the river 
 flow easier and for better fishing and
 river life.                           
                                       
   His length of river runs from Jobs  
 Mill to Heytesbury railway bridge.This
 is set into 'beats'.  In the beat     
 downstream of Bishopstrow there are   
 brown trout, rainbow grayling and a   
 few roach.  In the upper beats there  
 are brown trout and a few rainbow     
 graylings. Other living things in the 
 river are cray-fish, water shrimps    
 which give the trout pink flesh,      
 clams,mussels and eels.               </content>
