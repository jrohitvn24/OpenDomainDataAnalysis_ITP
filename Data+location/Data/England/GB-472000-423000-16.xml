		<content>                                       
  On a weekday morning,I am awakened by
 the noise blaring from my clock radio 
 at 7.15. When I have washed and       
 dressed I pack my school bag - and    
 often forget something - before going 
 downstairs. While my mother is        
 preparing breakfast,I watch the early 
 morning television programmes.        
  After eating breakfast I have a paper
 round to do which takes about twenty  
 five minutes. Often, with very little 
 time to spare, I then have to rush    
 home,grab my bag and leave for school.
  Weekends are much more relaxed and I 
 stay in bed much longer to make up for
 all the sleep lost during the week !
