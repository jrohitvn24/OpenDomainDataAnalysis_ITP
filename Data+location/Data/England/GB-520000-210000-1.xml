		<title>01WELWYN GARDEN CITY</title>
		<content> Situated in a{50}sqr mile area of     
 countryside the Welwyn Hatfield       
 district borders Greater London to the
 South and to the North encompasses    
 rural Hertfordshire.In the centre of  
 this district is Welwyn Garden City,a 
 garden city,designed in the{1930s}by  
 Ebeneezer Howard and Louis de         
 Soissons.Although Hatfield to the     
 South and Welwyn to the North are     
 steeped in historical interest,prior  
 to the{1930s}W.G.C was nothing but    
 fields.Indeed the rural beginnings are
 retained as W.G.C has open spaces with
 trees and spaces of carefully         
 maintained grass and flowers.Initially
 designed to be separate from the      
 housing area,the industrial area      
 caters for firms such as Nabisco and  
 Roche.W.G.C is linked to London by    
 electric trains to Kings Cross.Bus    
 routes link local and distant places. </content>
