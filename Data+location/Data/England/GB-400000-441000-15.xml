		<title>15SUTTON OLD BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>    The part of Sutton in the block has
 the oldest buildings.High Street was  
 the focus of Old Sutton.Craven        
 House,facing up High St.,is one of the
 oldest houses being of late sixteenth 
 or early seventeenth century origin.A 
 house in King's Court,off High St.,and
 over 200 years old,has a large first  
 floor room,used by James Sugden for   
 woolcombing in the 1840's.The house   
 has thick walls and a wide staircase. 
    Several old properties adjoin "The 
 Ellers",a steep,winding road leading  
 from High St. up onto Sutton Moor.The 
 name "Ellers" was spelt "Hellers" in  
 1851 and comes from the Norse word for
 alder trees.Sutton House was built by 
 Richard Dixon in 1639 but today has an
 eighteenth century facade.Higher up,  
 America Farm,probably takes it's name 
 from "Merica Ben",a tenant who had    
 travelled in the U.S.A. in the 1860's.</content>
