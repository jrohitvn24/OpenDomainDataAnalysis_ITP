The Y5 pupils of St. Mary's CoE Primary School, Timsbury have taken up the Domesday 2011 challenge to find out more about the lives of people who live and work in Timsbury. &lt;br />&lt;br />During literacy sessions they have studied entries from 1985 and made several discoveries about life over 30 years ago in their village. Working in groups the children surveyed over 30 local people and here are the results from interviews and surveys, written by the children themselves.&lt;br />&lt;br />We sent over 30 surveys to people living in Timsbury. The surveys asked question about: family life, hobbies, jobs, homes and general life styles. We found that 33 people surveyed were not born in Timsbury and one person was born in Timsbury. We found out that 32 people have children and that only two people do not have any children.   &lt;br />
