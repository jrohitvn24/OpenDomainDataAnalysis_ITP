		<title>09HOUSING IN/AROUND CHAGFORD</title>
		<content> While most of the houses in and around
 Chagford are{privately owned,}there   
 are some{Council Houses}in Chagford   
 itself. There are examples of mag_    
 nificent houses standing in their own 
 grounds, some dating back to the 13th 
 and 14th Centuries.  One style part_  
 icular to this area is the{Devon long_
{house,}which is basically a house with
 a central cross_passage.  On one side 
 of this passage lived the people,     
 while on the other lived the animals. 
 The majority of old houses have roofs 
 of{thatch}and walls partly of{Cob,}a  
 mixture of straw, dung and water, and 
 mostly of granite, found in abundance.
 Houses have been built within the last
 two years in Chagford itself, while   
 the bungalows in the{Lamb Park}estate 
 have been built for some 10 years.    
 Moorlands caters for old people as    
 does the{Greenacres Nursing Home.     </content>
