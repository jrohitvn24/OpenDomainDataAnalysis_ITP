		<content>{North Yorkshire Police Headquarters}  
 In Newby Wiske there are the North    
 Yorkshire Police County               
 Headquarters.They are housed in what  
 once was a stately home.In 1948 the   
 house was bought for a Police Training
 College and in 1977 it became the     
 police headquarters.You can still see 
 it was a beautiful home because it has
 big brass door knobs,large fire places
 and a lovely curving stair case.      
 We met the Chief Constable and he     
 answered our questions.We found out   
 that there are 1163 policemen in the  
 county and only 89 police women.In    
 1984 there were 6062 accidents and one
 of the worst was when a farmer was    
 burning stubble and the fire got out  
 of control and the smoke covered the  
 road and cars crashed.
