		<content> This is an historical area,which has  
 been continuously inhabited for 5000  
 years.{Cold Kitchen Hill}with its     
 ancient trackways,ditch systems and   
 long barrow shows evidence of man's   
 occupation from earliest times.       
 The area also has a strong tradition  
 of folk-lore associated with{King     
{Alfred.}Throughout this long history  
 man has left his mark on the          
 land-scape but it remains essentially 
 rural.In recent years in-filling of   
 'Executive-style' new houses has      
 occurred in Longbridge. Dutch Elm     
 disease had a great effect on the     
 landscape when trees disappeared from 
 the hedge-rows.Hedges have been       
 grubbed out to create larger more     
 efficient fields and improve crop     
 yields.The busy A350 has increased in 
 traffic but once thro'Longbridge it   
 leaves the valley to its ancient peace</content>
