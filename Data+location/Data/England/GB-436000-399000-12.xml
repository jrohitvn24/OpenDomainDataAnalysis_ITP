		<content>{Hoyland Lowe Stand}is on land at a    
 height of six hundred feet.Hoyland    
 Lowe Stand is to the west of the      
 township of Hoyland.In 1924,the stand 
 and the land in the immediate vicinity
 was purchased by the Dearne Valley    
 Water Board.For many years the Stand  
 had been occupied as a dwelling house.
 Hoyland Low Stand came into being when
 cairns and columns were built.The     
 accepted theory is that the Stand was 
 erected about the year{1720,}at a time
 when surrounding countryside was given
 ever to{hunting,}that it served as a  
 huntsman's box and as a observation   
 point .We estimated the height of Lowe
 Stand to be 20 metres  high and a     
 girth of 14 metres.When we visited the
 building it was in a very bad state of
 repair.From Lowe Stand we could see   
 all around the county of South        
 Yorkshire.                            </content>
