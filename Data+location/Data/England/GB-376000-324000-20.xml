 area has a number of recreational     
 clubs which cater for various age     
 groups. There is a snooker club and a 
 football club, both of which play in  
 local leagues. Based on the Village   
 Hall in Woodseaves are the Youth Club,
 the Darby &amp; Joan Club, and the Womens'
 Institute. Whist drives are held every
 fortnight in the Village Hall. There  
 is also a Brownie pack.               
 A piece of land has recently been     
 acquired which belongs to the School  
 in Dickys Lane,Woodseaves.The land is 
 rented by the Parish Council from the 
 County Council for a nominal amount   
 and is used as a playing field for    
 organised and casual games.           
 Local pubs run darts and domino teams 
 and one pub runs a Horticultural      
 Club,the garden produce being sold    
 every week,the money going to charity.</content>
