		<content>  Most of the work is now carried out  
 by{machines}and ever increasing use is
 made of chemical fertilisers          
 and sprays. Retired farm-workers who  
 had worked all their lives on the land
 told us that the greatest change they 
 had seen was the replacement of horses
 by{tractors}and the use of machines to
 replace hand methods.                 
  An important result of mechanisation 
 is the decline of the{labour force}on 
 the farms. One farmer told us he farms
 200 acres single-handed, yet as       
 recently as l5 years ago he employed  
 six men full-time.                    
  Mechanisation and the smaller labour 
 force has led to the widespread       
 destruction of{hedgerows}here as      
 elsewhere in East Anglia. Many        
 hedgerows however remain. The same    
 farmer told us that he had not removed
 any hedgerows in the last l5 years.   </content>
