<title>25A day in a life</title>
<content>

I woke up early this morning and Holly was already awake playing on her bed. Next we went downstairs I had Weetabix that my mum made for me. Then I went downstairs because every Saturday I have swimming lessons while we were swimming my mum was helping at the school fair. My dad made us lunch while we were having a shower. After lunch my dad took us to the school fair. My mum was on the treasure hunt when we arrived we all helped mum.&lt;br />&lt;br />Simona, my dad and I had a go at the coconut shy, Simona and I got a coconut and dad didn’t. When we came back mum said you can go and get some raffle tickets. I got some and saw the Funky Chicks they were good. Then I went into the year 1 and 2 playground and we saw Ryan we had pink hair so we queued up and we had some of coconut I won from the coconut shy.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Next we went to Chloe’s party and that finished at 5pm. My mum picked me up and we went home and went to bed.    &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
