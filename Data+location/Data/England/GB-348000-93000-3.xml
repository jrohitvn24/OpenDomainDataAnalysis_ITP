 In the Second World War it had one    
 anti-aircraft siding with two guns.   
 There were four different kinds       
 of engines: they were 0-6-0t pannier  
 tanks,0-4-0 prairy tank,electric      
 and a 0-6-0 saddle tank.              
 West bay used to be called Bridport   
 Harbour but the railway men called    
 it West Bay so gradually it was       
 changed to Westbay.The railway ran at 
 the bottom of Boarsbarrow Hill and    
 there was an accident at Bradpole     
 crossing when a diesel locomotive     
 failed to stop at the gates. Luckily  
 there was no casualties.              
 There were also two other branch lines
 of the G.W.R. They were the line from 
 Abbotsbury to Weymouth that was also a
 single track and the big line from    
 Bristol to Weymouth that was a double 
 track.                                </content>
