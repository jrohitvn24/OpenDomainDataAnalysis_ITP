		<title>18Hadley Bowling Green Club</title>
		<content> Hadley Bowling Green, in the heart or 
 rural Worcestershire, is one of the   
 oldest{Crown Greens}in England. It is 
 thought to date back to Roman times,  
 as many{Roman relics}have been dug up 
 in the past. The Bowling Club started 
 in the reign of the first Elizabeth,  
 and the yew hedge which surrounds part
 of the Green is thought to date back  
 to then. An inn was built adjoining   
 the Green, and{Queen Elizabeth}was    
 staying there just prior to{Sir       
{Francis Drake's}famous game of bowls  
 on the Hoe at Plymouth on the eve of  
 the Spanish Armada. The Bowling Club  
 meets twelve times a year and have a  
 meal at the Inn.In the{Club House}are 
 all the charts, plaques and pictures  
 that have been collected throughout   
 the long history of the Club. Recently
 a{Clay Pigeon Shooting Club}has also  
 been started, based at the Inn.       </content>
