		<title>15The Reservoir, St. Peter</title>
		<content>   The reservoir in Val de la Mare     
 valley was planned during the later   
 1950s and built in the early 1960s.   
 The site was a wild valley of         
 luxuriant valley vegetation and gorse.
  It had not been used for anything    
 since the Germans built their railway 
 from Ronez Quarries down to the       
 defence works they were creating in St
 Ouen's Bay in the middle years of the 
 Second World War.  The track was never
 used after the Germans left.          
   Since building the reservoir, the   
 waterworks company have laid a path   
 from its head to the dam.  This is    
 a popular walk for people.  The       
 reservoir is also stocked with trout  
 (Rainbow and Brown) and used on a     
 licence basis for fishing.
