		<content>The farming in this area is concerned  
with 2 main products-  ARABLE- cereals 
used for biscuits and breakfast cereals
and distributed nationally &amp;           
internationally.LIVESTOCK-mainly wool, 
meat and milk.in one case,2/3 of the   
milk went to London by rail &amp; 1/3 to   
Cheltenham.There is some variation in  
markets for the products.Any meat or   
livestock are taken to markets in the  
Midlands or locally eg Gloucester      
Cirencester &amp; Andoversford.All eggs go 
to Cheltenham or locally.              
  The EEC has had an effect on trade   
with a cut-back on cows because of     
overproduction of milk and butter and  
an increase in cereal production. Over 
the past 40 years there has been a     
continuous pattern of change and this  
should be seen as the most recent part 
of it .EEC bureaucracy is disliked.
