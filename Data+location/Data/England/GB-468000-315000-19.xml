		<content> Kirby Bellars is a smaller village    
 than Frisby, and lies closer to the   
 main road (A607).The housing types are
 chalet bungalow,a small modern estate 
 and a large hunting lodge now         
 converted to flats. The Village       
 Hall,built in 1925  is used           
 regularly through the week by         
 the Art Club , the Dog Training Group,
 W.I.and various other people on a     
 private basis.Small fund raising      
 events are held, usually in aid of    
 Church funds.                         
 There is no proper shop in the        
 village:the Post office is based      
 in a private house,but various mobile 
 tradespeople,including a butcher, fish
 &amp; chip van and grocer call regularly. 
 Local people were concerned by the    
 lack of a proper shop, morning        
 paper delivery and recreational       
 facilities.                           </content>
