		<title>13Beckhampton</title>
		<content> Beckhampton is a hamlet with a        
 roundabout through the middle. Not    
 many people live there. There are two 
 farms, a public house frequented by   
 the racing fraternity especially      
 stable lads and apprentice jockeys,   
 and Jeremy Tree's racing stables. A   
 large plantation of conifers          
 "protects" the 28 or so houses. These 
 houses are a mixture of old and new as
 is the population. Although a tight   
 knit community the people of          
 Beckhampton mix freely with those of  
 Avebury through the primary school,   
 the social centre activities and the  
 Church. Despite the necessity to cross
 the dangerous A.4 trunk road the      
 children of Beckhampton often go into 
 Avebury to play with their peers.There
 are no shops in Beckhampton most      
 people shop in Marlborough,           
 occasionally Swindon or Calne.        </content>
