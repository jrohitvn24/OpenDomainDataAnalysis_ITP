		<title>20PIG OAK</title>
		<content> In the village of Holt there is{Pig   
{Oak.}It is named after an oak tree in 
 the middle of a field. The owners of  
 the field had to take their pigs to   
 the tree so that they could eat the   
 acorns. They did this because ponies  
 were in the field and too many acorns 
 kill them.                            
{THE FARM AND TACKROOM                 
 Pig Oak Farm is mainly a beef and     
 cattle farm. One of the rooms in the  
 farm itself is the tackroom. It       
 contains everything for horses and    
 their riders including cleaning kits  
 and medical equipment for the horses, 
 and clothes for the riders. It is     
 cheaper to buy medical supplies from  
 the tackroom than from your local vet.
