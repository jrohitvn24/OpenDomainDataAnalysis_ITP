		<title>02       THE MARKET</title>
		<content>   Masham market place is one of the   
 largest in northern England and also  
 one of the quietest. For much of the  
 day it is deserted except for a few   
 parked cars.                          
   Markets are held on{Wednesdays}and  
{Saturdays.}During the summer the      
 number of stalls has steadily         
 increased so that now there are about 
 a dozen stalls on average. People can 
 buy:{vegetables,fruit,plants,health-  
{foods,linen,home-made cakes,kitchen-  
{ware,old books,sweets,bric-a-brac,    
{clothing,materials,cheeses,fish,foot- 
{wear.}                                
   During the winter there are not so  
 many stalls.                          
   There is an ancient market cross    
 and the markets date back to a Charter
 given by Richard II in 1393 to Stephen
 le Scrope,Lord of the Manor at that   
 time.                                 </content>
