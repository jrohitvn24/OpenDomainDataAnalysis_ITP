		<title>17Tourism - Powburn Area</title>
		<content> Our area is becoming increasingly     
 popular with tourists.  There is a    
 large caravan site run by the local   
 council near Branton.  It is open from
 Easter until October and is specially 
 for touring caravans.' Bed and        
 breakfast' is also  offered during the
 Summer months at several farmhouses.  
                                       
 There are, at present, seven cottages 
 in our area which are being used as   
 holiday homes. In view of the fact    
 that the area is fairly sparsely      
 populated, this is quite a high       
 proportion.                           
                                       
 People like to come here for holidays 
 because there are lots of good walks, 
 the countryside is quiet and peaceful 
 and they get plenty of fresh air.
