 the northern edge of Wellington, Apley
 Park, and part of the parish of       
 Eyton-on-the-Wealdmoors.There is a    
 small area of woodland and a new      
 housing development.A new hospital is 
 being built and a factory and improved
 road system have recently been opened.
 At Dothill there are blocks of flats  
 as well as houses and the area        
 contains two pools which are homes for
 swans.At Hadley there is a            
 long-established factory and features 
 of historical interest.At Apley       
 there is a nursery on the site of an  
 old house.
