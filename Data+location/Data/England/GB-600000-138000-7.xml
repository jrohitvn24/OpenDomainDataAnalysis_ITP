 is part of a large 5,000 dwelling     
 housing estate known as{STANHOPE.}This
 was part of London overspill          
 re_housing in the late 60's.  The     
 Kingsnorth Road shows typical ribbon  
 development of late '20s and '30s; the
 Tennyson Road area has houses of the  
 post World War II era, re_furbishment 
 has recently  been carried out, in    
 addition there are pockets of modern  
 infill. Kingsnorth village has houses 
 mentioned in 17C. Chronicles as does  
 Sevington. For the rest, there are    
 single farm cottages and houses of    
 varying age from modern to middle     
 ages. Many of these have been         
 converted to modern commuter needs.   
 One Pattison Farmhouse is typical with
 a building date of 1802.
