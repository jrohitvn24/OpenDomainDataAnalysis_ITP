		<content>   {Little Sutton C.of E. Primary      
{School}stands on Berwick Road near    
 "The Olde School House Hotel". It was 
 built in{1867,}the date being engraved
 at the site of the old bell tower.    
 The five classes, three infant and two
 junior,total 100 pupils. Recently     
{class One,}whilst studying the        
 Edwardians, invited{a 70 year old     
{lady,}a former pupil to come into     
 school to talk. She{described}being   
 caned by the Headmaster for being late
 and not standing up straight. Class   
 One were relieved that this does not  
 happen now! When asked{what changes   
 they would notice if they came back to
 the school{in 70 years time,}some of  
 the pupils thought that teachers would
 have been{replaced by robots and      
{computers.}Would there still be books 
 and paper? They will have to wait and 
 see!                                  </content>
