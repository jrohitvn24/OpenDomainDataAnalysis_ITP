		<content> Much of the land cover in our area is 
 arable farmland. Several different    
 crops are grown. Peas, sugar beet,    
 wheat, barley, onions, sprouts and    
 strawberries are the main crops. In a 
 few fields sugar beet is grown with a 
 border of barley or potatoes. This is 
 to make the harvesting of beet easier.
 Most of the wheat and barley is cut in
 late August and early September. The  
 beet is harvested in October. Potatoes
 are taken up in autumn by hand and    
 machine. The crops are changed from   
 year to year to keep the land good.   
 There are a few meadows which provide 
 pasture for cattle. Drainage ditches  
 run alongside most of the fields. The 
 herds are Friesian, Jersey and        
 Hereford. Some bullocks are           
 slaughtered in early November. Poultry
 is bred by factory farming methods for
 major suppliers.                      </content>
