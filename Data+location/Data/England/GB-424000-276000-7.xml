		<title>07THE BELL INN, TILE HILL</title>
		<content> The Bell Inn is in Tile Hill Village. 
 It is a public house attached to Bass 
 brewery. It opens from 11a.m. until   
 2.30p.m. every lunchtime and reopens  
 at 6p.m. On Mondays to Thursdays it   
 closes at 10.30p.m. but at weekends it
 is open until 11p.m. The only day in  
 the year it does not open is in the   
 evening on Christmas Day. The busiest 
 day of the week is Friday-both lunch- 
 time and in the evening. Six and a    
 half thousand pints of beer and lager 
 are sold in one week while the most   
 popular spirits are whisky and gin. A 
 variety of fruit juices are sold as   
 well as lemonade and coke. In the     
 evening most of the customers are     
 local but at lunchtime about 50% come 
 from local factories as bar snacks are
 served then, the most popular being   
 filled bread rolls, with hot snacks   
 being sold more in cold weather.      </content>
