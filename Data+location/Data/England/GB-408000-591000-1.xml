		<content> The area around Nunnykirk is a very   
 rural area which is part of two large 
 estates belonging to the Ord &amp;        
 Trevellyan families.   Most of the    
 land is used for grazing sheep or     
 cattle but there are several small    
 mixed woodland areas which are homes  
 for deer, fox, squirrel, rabbits,     
 pheasants etc.   There is a local     
 woodsman and gamekeeper and game      
 shooting is a popular pastime.   The  
 river Font flows through the area from
 the reservoir further west.   This is 
 a sparsely populated area with most   
 people working on local farms or at   
 Nunnykirk Hall School which was, until
 nine years ago, the Ord family home.  
 The local inhabitants have to travel  
 to Morpeth (10 miles away) or         
 Newcastle (30 miles away) for shopping
 or entertainment.
