		<title>20TOURISM IN NORTH HAMPSHIRE</title>
		<content> Faccombe is popular as a riding and   
 walking area. It is used regularly by 
 the Ramblers' Association who keep a  
 check on footpaths and signposts. The 
 public house, recently refurbished,   
 provides snacks, meals and            
 accomodation.                         
 From a height of 700ft on the         
 Hampshire Downs, Linkenholt overlooks 
 the valley of the Bourne, across to   
 Doles Wood and Tangley Clumps. To the 
 east &amp; north the famous walking area  
 of Sheepless Hill and Summer Hill are 
 dwarfed by Inkpen Beacon and Warbury  
 Hill.                                 
 A sight line has recently been made;  
 it is said that on a clear day the    
 Solent and the Isle of Wight can be   
 seen from a vantage point at Faccombe.
