		<title>15COMMUTER BELT - HORTON KIRBY</title>
		<content>    The commuter belt surrounding      
 London has grown systematically over  
 the past 25 years. Both employment and
 housing patterns have changed with    
 resulting effects on family life.     
 London, with its job opportunities but
 relatively expensive housing, has     
 required a steady level of employment.
 Consequently, Horton Kirby, South     
 Darenth and other similar communities 
 have become part of the commuting     
 belt. A reasonable train service and  
 direct road routes to employment      
 centres have contributed to this      
 change. The main objective when comm- 
 uting to work in London is to reduce  
 travelling time and costs to the      
 minimum. The railway is often hampered
 by bad weather and labour disputes,   
 and road travel is delayed by traffic 
 congestion. The uncertainty of travel 
 time is the commuters' nightmare.     </content>
