		<title>03Sileby</title>
		<content> Sileby hasn't got alot to offer for   
 children of our age.It has a few      
 playing areas and a park that people  
 go to but most of the rides have been 
 vandalised.There is a library that is 
 popular and  a pub called the         
 Free Trade where children are allowed 
 to play as long as they are with an   
 adult.{This is how I think Sileby     
{could be improved.                    
 We're a long way from the sea so a    
 Lido would be great.The nearest       
 Leisure Centre is 4 miles away in     
 Loughborough.                         
 I would like to see more clubs and    
 activities like gym clubs and horse   
 riding and swimming clubs.            
 I wish Sileby had more things to go   
 and see like museums and a big super  
 market or an antique shop.
