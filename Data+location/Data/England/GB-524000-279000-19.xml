		<title>19Education around Raveley</title>
		<content> There are no schools within the three 
 villages of Great and Little Raveley  
 and Wistow, although Wistow does have 
 a small preschool playgroup for the   
 under fives. Children of primary      
 school age, 4+ to ll, are collected   
 daily by bus and taken to Upwood      
 County Primary School.  Secondary     
 school children are also collected by 
 bus and taken to Ailwyn School,       
 Ramsey, where they remain until the   
 age of l3+, when they are transferred 
 to the adjacent Abbey School.   Here  
 they can either leave at l6 or        
 continue their education by taking    
 CSE's and 'O' level and 'A' level     
 examinations.  Students are able to   
 further their education at Huntingdon 
 Technical College, 6 miles away.      
 Adult education facilities are        
 provided at Ailwyn School, Ramsey and 
 at Huntingdon Technical College.      </content>
