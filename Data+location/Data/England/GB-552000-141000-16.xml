 Before the forge was a garage it was a
 blacksmiths forge. It has been a      
 garage for 19 years. Mr Streeter has  
 worked there since it was a garage. It
 belongs to Penshurst Place. The garage
 was built as a blacksmiths forge in   
 1966. It has been robbed 3 times. Once
 the robbers took the safe out of the  
 wall, they stole Â£600.                
         {Ford Place}                  
 Ford Place which was the manor house  
 of the ancient manor of Hepstroke. A  
 name which occurs in one of the       
 "yokes" in Roman times. It is stated  
 to have been the residence of the     
 Sidney family before they were given  
 Penshurst Place by Edward VI in 1552  
 and certainly seems to have been used 
 as their dower house as it is referrd 
 to as "fford pallace".
