		<title>01UPPER KENT ESTUARY</title>
		<content> This area is a tidal estuary beyond   
 the confluence of the Rivers Kent,    
 Bela and Gilpin. The small section of 
 the Eastern shoreline of the estuary  
 includes parts of the villages of     
{Storth}and{Sandside.}                 
 The major part - to the west of the   
 estuary - is mainly woodland. There   
 are low-lying arable farmlands and a  
 few large dairy farms on the west,    
 separated from the wooded area by a   
 North/South mudstone outcrop.         
 The main trunk road to{Barrow}and W.  
 Cumbria effectively forms the northern
 boundary of the area, this road       
 providing the only real link between  
 the east and west.                    
 Roads within the western section are  
 poor - only farm tracks and footpaths 
 in the main.
