		<title>01Introduction to the area</title>
		<content>This area is in Greater London.Its     
western boundary is on high ground     
sloping down to the river Wandle which 
runs from south to north through the   
centre. It includes parts of Wimbledon,
Tooting and Wandsworth. These were once
seperate villages but they were joined 
in the last century when the railway   
made it possible for London workers to 
live in the country. Even today many   
inhabitants of the area travel by the  
Southern Region of British Rail or the 
District Line of the underground       
to jobs in Central London.There is     
still much C19 housing - big houses    
with large gardens in the west and     
small terraced houses in the east -    
mixed in with industry and commerce.   
There are also several open spaces.
