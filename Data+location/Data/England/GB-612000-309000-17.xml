		<content> College:                              
                                       
  The people of Easton have{little to  
{do}with the college. In the past any  
{trouble}has been{blamed}on the        
{college,}but recently two{Easton      
{youths}were found{guilty}of{stealing  
 property from the college. There is a 
 kind of{love/hate}relationship        
 existing.                             
                                       
 The Nowich Southern Bypass            
                                       
  In{1937}it was proposed that a new   
 bypass should be made around Easton   
 village.                              
                                       
  The suggestions that were made for   
 the routes inevitably pass through    
 agricultural land, including the      
{Easton Lodge estate, the Agricultural 
{college and the Royal Showground.     </content>
