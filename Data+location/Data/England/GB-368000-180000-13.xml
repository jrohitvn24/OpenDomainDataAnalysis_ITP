		<content>      Yate,which was once a village in 
 Gloucestershire,is surrounded by      
 farms.                                
      There are some dairy farms       
 producing milk.                       
      Many of the farms grow some      
 cereals and oil-seed rape.            
      Also many fields are sown and    
 fertilised grassland used for pasture 
 or for cutting as grass,silage or hay.
      Fields are used as pasture or    
 paddocks for the many ponies and      
 horses which are kept for recreational
 purposes.                             
     In the past a livestock market was
 held close to the old railway station 
 site .Both are now closed and have    
 been demolished.
