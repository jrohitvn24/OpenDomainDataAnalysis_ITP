		<title>17Grafham Water Nature Trails.</title>
		<content>   Two{nature trails}have been laid out
 within the nature reserve.            
   The first starts at the west        
 end of the Mander car park at the     
 south west end of the reservoir. The  
{short trail}is about three quarters of
 a mile while the{long trail}is double 
 the length. The{bird hide}administered
 by the Beds and Hunts Naturalist Trust
 is situated on this trail overlooking 
 Grafham Water.                        
   The second trail, the{Savages       
{Spinney Nature Trail,}is on the north 
 west shores of the reservoir. Access  
 is from the Hill Farm car park and the
 trail covers some three and a half    
 miles and passes through Savages      
 Spinney, an old and well-established  
 woodland. This wood is frequented by  
 Muntjac Deer whose tracks may be seen 
 in the soft mud.
