		<title>18WALKING AROUND BASSINGBOURN</title>
		<content> On Tuesday July 10th we went out of   
 the school. We walked across the play 
 ground. We passed 5 staff houses then 
 on the north side of the road there   
 was a grazing field. We came to the   
 brook and crossed over. We passed     
 other fields of crops. We had also    
 passed 5 houses and Low Farm.       {*
  We turned back down a little track.{*
 This track led us to Wellhead. On   {*
 the way we saw more crops. On the   {*
 south side was a disused clunch pit.{*
  We walked down the last piece of   {*
 the track over the stile and into  {**
 the school. We were all very hot   {**
 because of the lovely hot day.     {**
