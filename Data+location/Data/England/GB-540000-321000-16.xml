		<title>16    THE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     There is a date stone on the front
 of the Primary School which says,     
 "Free School_A.D. 1835". This year we 
 are celebrating our 150th anniversary.
 It is probably the 400th anniversary  
 of the first primary school in Long   
 Sutton which was held in the South    
 Porch of the church.By 1828 the school
 was not large enough to cope with the 
 children so a new one was needed. In  
 1835 this school was built. The school
 was enlarged in 1843 and 1872. Girls  
 and boys were taught seperately. Until
 1952 children spent all their school  
 life here. Then the Peele Secondary   
 School was opened. In 1986, hopefully 
 a new primary school will open        
     Perhaps the old school will be    
 demolished and an old folks' home     
 built.
