		<title>03THE BOGS</title>
		<content>                                       
   The Bogs is a piece of land near the
 bridge over Scorton beck.The reason   
 why the Bogs is called by that name   
 is because it used to be swampy       
 land,and it still is in parts.        
   After the Green was levelled the    
 people of Scorton used the Bogs as a  
 rubbish tip.                          
   Then the Parish Council decided to  
 have it all grassed over.Hundreds of  
 tons of soil were brought from the    
 Gatherley Road trading estate when the
 Cadbury's Smash factory was being     
 built.                                
   On the Bogs there is a tree with a  
 stone seat around it.They were given  
 by the R.A.O.B.(the Buffs),and cost   
 Â£200 in 1982.R.A.O.B.stands for the   
 Royal Antidiluvian Order of the       
 Buffaloes.
