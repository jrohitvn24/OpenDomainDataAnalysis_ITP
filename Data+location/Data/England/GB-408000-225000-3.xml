		<content> The Cotswold District Council provides
 road maintenance and snow clearing in 
 the winters when it is often very much
 needed. They also employ dustmen who  
 come every Monday. The County         
 Authority is the Gloucestershire      
 County Council who run the            
 Schools,Police etc.                   
 The Parish Council for most of our    
 area is the Temple Guiting Parish     
 Council whose chairman is Mr. C.      
 Hickman of Kineton. The rest of the   
 area is served by the Guiting Power   
 Parish Council.
