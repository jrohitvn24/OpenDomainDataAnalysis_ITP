		<title>07THE MORAVIAN CHAPEL</title>
		<content>    During the 19th century            
 Baltonsborough Parish Church was      
 thought to be too Anglo_Catholic for  
 many of its parishioners. An abortive 
 appeal to the Squire of Butleigh led  
 to approaches being made to all       
 non-conformist churches. The Moravians
 showed interest and the chapel was    
 built in 1852 with finance from three 
 local men. The Manse was built in 1859
 and in 1861 a school was built which  
 sixty children attended. The Moravian 
 community broke up in 1963,the school 
 closed and the Manse and the chapel   
 are now private houses. One resident  
 is still eligible for burial in the   
 Moravian cemetery, now a garden.
