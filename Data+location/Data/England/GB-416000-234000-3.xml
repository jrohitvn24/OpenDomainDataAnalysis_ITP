		<title>03Farming land</title>
		<content> This is what you call a mixed farm.   
 It has a north and east escarpment.   
 Mr.Dee was born on the farm.His father
 worked there.He loved the land and had
 a love of the animals and he needed a 
 lot of patience. You don't need a lot 
 of qualifications in farming.         
       Mr.Dee gets up at 6.00a.m.and   
 goes to bed at 11.00p.m.He said the   
 land was beautiful.He said that he    
 lives in a nice spot and it was a     
 healthy spot and it had lot of springs
 in the ground.                        
       Then Mrs Dee said they had found
 flints and arrow heads. So they took  
 them to the Corinium Museum.          
        The pond on his land is shown  
 on all the maps.It is a fish pond.    
        A man had a summer palace in   
 Blockley it was bought for use in the 
 summer.The farm has been recently     
 modernised and is very old.           </content>
