		<title>16A VISITOR'S VIEW OF RYTON</title>
		<content>  Most people who see Ryton are only   
 passing through on the A45(T).To them 
 the village is no more than a garage, 
 a large pub painted to hit the eye    
 rather than to attract it, and a blur 
 of road signs and crash barriers.     
  To a few it is a stopping off place  
 for a drink, some chips or to refuel  
 the car before heading on into        
 Coventry; or Northampton.             
  Yet off the road{Ryton}is a{quiet    
 village with a{church}that is well    
 worth a closer look. The main street  
 winds it's way southwards between some
 old fashioned{cottages}to join the    
 Leamington road. The village is{neat  
 and{well kept}and there is an         
 abundance of{flowers.}The village does
 have a{park}for the children to play  
 in, and several places serving good   
{food.}It also boasts it's{"best Kept  
{Village"}status with a small sign.    </content>
