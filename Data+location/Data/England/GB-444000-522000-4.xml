		<title>04Interviewing the Curate</title>
		<content> This is an interview with Michael     
 Alexander Tobias Rubus Aisbit, the    
 Curate of Saint Mary's Church in      
 Norton.                               
 The oldest part of the church is 965  
 years old. It was built in 1020 AD.   
 The oldest part of the church is the  
 tower. The church is the only example 
 of a Saxon Cruciform Church in        
 Northumbria. In the early 19th century
 the church had balconies but they had 
 to be knocked off or they would have  
 fallen off. The old vicarage (now part
 of Red House School) was very large.  
 The Vicar owned lots of land which    
 people used to farm and pay rent. This
 meant the Vicar was very rich. This   
 land was called Glebeland and is now  
 covered in houses. In the church      
 graveyard there are so many graves    
 that you can not be buried there.
