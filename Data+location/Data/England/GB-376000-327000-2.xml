		<content>{Adbaston} The hilly North West area   
is predominantly rough pasture, whilst 
the   loams and clay loams of the      
West, South and Central areas contain  
arable crops and more intensively      
managed grass for silage.  One farm    
was entirely arable, growing wheat,    
barley and sugar beet, the others      
being either mixed or live- stock      
only. Arable crops on mixed farms were 
wheat, barley and oilseed rape. Cattle 
on mixed farms were mostly for beef,   
one farm at Bishops Offley having 250  
beef animals. In the livestock only    
group, cattle for milk and beef were   
in equal numbers. Other livestock      
included sheep on 3 farms and there    
was a 300 strong pig unit at 'The      
Tunstalls'. Farm sizes (ha) vary from  
7 to 98, with a mean of 42 ha. The     
mean for arable and mixed is 61 ha,    
others 23ha.                           </content>
