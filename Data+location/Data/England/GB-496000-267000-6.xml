		<content>        The FERRERS SCHOOL is a mixed  
comprehensive for 11-18 year olds with 
742 pupils on roll. It is a single     
storey building which although only 5  
years old is already overcrowded, with 
mobiles all over the place.            
        There is no corporal punishment
and rules are not all that strict.     
However all pupils are expected to wear
a smart blue uniform with a tie and    
school badge showing the town shield.  
        The teachers are good and easy 
to get on with and most are very young.
There are plenty of lunchtime and after
school activities which many pupils    
attend e.g.sport and hobby clubs.      
        Following a survey of 2nd year 
pupils it was found that the most      
popular lesson was Maths and the least 
popular was German.                    
        New subjects include;Control   
Technology, Electonics &amp; Computers.    </content>
