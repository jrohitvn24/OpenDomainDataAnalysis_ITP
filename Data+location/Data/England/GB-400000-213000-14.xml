		<content> Most older houses are situated around 
 the Church in a special conservation  
 area.This means that people have to   
 keep their houses as they have always 
 been.Houses in this area are built    
 with Cotswold stone and the roofs are 
 made with Cotswold tiles. There are   
 five particularly interesting houses  
 which are{The Manor House, The Old    
{Rectory, Halewell Close,The Corner    
{House}and{The Old Forge.}Parts of all 
 these houses date back to the{15      
{Century.                              
 To the west of the conservation area  
 some modern houses have been built    
 using reconstituted stone.The older   
 houses in Compton Rise are made       
 entirely out of wood and the more     
 recent ones have been built using     
 concrete blocks.Most of the houses in 
 Compton Rise are owned by the Cotswold
 District Council.                     </content>
