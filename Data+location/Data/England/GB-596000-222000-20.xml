		<title>20The Well House, Stanway.</title>
		<content>   On the way to the zoo from          
 Colchester, there is an interesting   
 house called the{Well House.}         
   The house has a well which is over  
 four hundred years old in the garden, 
 and this gives the house its name.    
    Down the road a bit was a house    
 called Draw Well because the people   
 long ago used to draw water from the  
 well.                                 
    Next to the Well House was a large 
 field and when the agricultural people
 came they said that the field next    
 door was the Romans' first place to   
 camp.                                 
    Now there is an extension on the   
 house which was built about 1975 and  
 another which was put on in 1983.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
