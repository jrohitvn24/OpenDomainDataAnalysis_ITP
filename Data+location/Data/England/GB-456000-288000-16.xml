		<content> Three species of tit are common with  
 blue, great and long tailed both      
 summer and winter.  Finches also flock
 in the winter and yellow hammers are  
 common.  Blackbirds and thrush are    
 seen year round and fieldfare and     
 redwing appear early in autumn and are
 found in gardens in hard winters.     
 Green and lesser spotted woodpeckers  
 are frequently seen and large numbers 
 of magpies reflect easy pickings in   
 spring and summer. 3 species of owl   
 are found with little owl commonly    
 seen, and tawny and barn owl.         
 The most potentially interesting area 
 is that of the disused airfield.  The 
 centre of the airfield is rough and   
 undisturbed and moorland bird species 
 such as curlews are resting there.    
 Development as a nature reserve is now
 being sought and should provide       
 interest in the future.               </content>
