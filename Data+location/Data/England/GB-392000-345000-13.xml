		<title>13Corn Mill Hulme Village</title>
		<content>The mill was established in 1965,but it
has not always been used as a mill.The 
last owners used it as a dairy.The mill
owners do not play any part in the     
village life although they supply local
farms with feed for livestock.They also
supply the general public.They employ  
five people,four of whom live in the   
village the other lives in nearby      
Longton.The everyday working hours are 
from eight o'clock in the morning to   
four o'clock in the afternoon.The mill 
also sells beef and pork.              
  The mill uses old equipment to mix,  
grind and pack the product.The corn is 
delivered by the mill's own truck.The  
working day varies during the summer   
months.Business is slow but builds up  
during the winter.                     
  The mill owner has 200 head of cattle
,from which he makes a profit by       
selling them to markets.               </content>
