		<title>15TILE KILN ESTATE CHELMSFORD</title>
		<content> The Tile Kiln Estate is a residential 
 area mainly built in the 1970's.      
 It covers an area of about one square 
 kilometre to the south of Chelmsford. 
                                       
 The Estate takes its name from the    
 farm whose land the houses are now    
 built on.The farm buildings no longer 
 exist.{Brick and tile making}has been 
 carried out in this area since{Roman  
{times}as Essex has no natural building
 stone and the clay soil here is just  
 right for bricks and tiles.There were 
 once many brick and tile works in the 
{Chelmsford and Galleywood}area but    
 none are left today.                  
                                       
 The Estate has its own parade of five 
 shops;as well as two primary schools, 
 a public house and a church.
