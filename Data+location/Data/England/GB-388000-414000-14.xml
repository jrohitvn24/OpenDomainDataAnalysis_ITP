 The chief attractions of Syke Common  
 are the ponds.One small pond has been 
 made for small children to paddle     
 in.The larger pond is a popular place 
 for sailing model boats, but is       
 especially good for tadpoles.         
  Syke Common is a good place for      
 children to play safely.Anyone may    
 play there and activities range from  
 horse riding to kite flying.Frogs have
 been seen living in deep horseshoe    
 impressions left in the mud.There are 
 many public footpaths in the Syke area
 which give short cuts through fields  
 and through the housing estates on the
 perimeter of the common.              
  Syke is very close to the moors and  
 so many walkers use Syke as an access 
 point to an area of local charm and   
 beauty.                               </content>
