		<content>{PLANNING THE PARK.}                   
   LORD BATHURST PLANNED THE PARK IN   
 THE STYLE OF VERSAILLES AND COMPIEGNE.
 A SERIES OF AVENUES MET IN A 'ROND    
 POINT' COMMANDING FINE VIEWS OF THE   
 COUNTRYSIDE. LORD BATHURST ADAPTED    
 THIS PLAN TO A DESIGN MORE TYPICAL OF 
 THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE THAN THE      
 FORMAL FRENCH GARDEN. TEN THOUSAND    
 ACRES WERE ADDED TO THE ESTATE. MANY  
 EXISTING TREES WERE CUT DOWN AND THE  
 CONTOURS OF THE LAND MOULDED TO GIVE  
 THE APPEARANCE OF HEIGHT AND DEPTH.   
 THE RESULT IS UNIQUE AND IS SAID TO BE
{ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF GEORGIAN
{LANDSCAPE-GARDEN. }                   
                                       
   THE WORK WAS BEGUN IN 1714 AND THE  
 SCENE HAS CHANGED BUT LITTLE SINCE    
 THAT TIME.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
