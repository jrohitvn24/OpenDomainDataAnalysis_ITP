		<title>02MY DAY IN SCREDINGTON.</title>
		<content> My name is Paul and I am seven years  
 old.On school days I get up at 8      
 o'clock and get dressed then I go     
 downstairs and have my breakfast.I get
 my bags and walk to school with James.
 We have a little play before the bell 
 goes at 9 o'clock. First we have a    
 little sing song, then we do maths and
 we write a story and we go out to     
 play. Sometimes we watch school       
 programmes and we have our lunch and a
 playtime. In the afternoon we go on   
 the computer and we bake cakes. At    
 three o'clock it is home time and my  
 mum and sister come to meet me and    
 when I get home I change my clothes   
 and I have a drink and a cake then I  
 go out to play. At five 0'clock my mum
 calls me. After tea I do my homework  
 and sometimes I go out to play and    
 sometimes I watch television and at 8 
 0'clock I have a bath and go to bed.  </content>
