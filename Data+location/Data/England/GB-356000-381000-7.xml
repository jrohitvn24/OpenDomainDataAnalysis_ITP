		<content> Some of the farm land will be lost to 
 new town housing as the development   
 approaches completion. There's a small
 brook called Keckwick Brook running   
 through. Too small for fish but there 
 are many insects living in and around 
 it. It kooked fairly clean but I would
 not like any to drink. There are 16   
 small ponds, 4 of which we think had  
 fish in them - they wre all fairly    
 clean and all of them were surrounded 
 by trees. Two of the ponds had private
 fishing signs up. There are four large
 areas of woodland with only one having
 more than 4000 trees. There were no   
 signs of felling being done recently. 
 The majority of the land is used for  
 growing crops with a little land used 
 for cattle.
