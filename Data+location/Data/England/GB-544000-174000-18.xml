		<title>18Danson Park</title>
		<content> There are lots of things for people to
 do.There are two gardens_the Old      
 English Garden and the Rockery_where  
 children are not allowed on their     
 own.They are mostly for old people who
 like to sit in peace and quiet.       
 There is a large artificial lake,where
 you can fish,row,hire a peddle boat or
 have a ride on a paddle-steamer.      
 Most people use the park for fun or   
 walking the dog.There are twenty      
 tennis courts,a bowling green,pitch   
 and put,football and rugby pitches.   
 In July they have the Bexley Show.The 
 main feature is the horticultural     
 show,but there are many side shows run
 by many charities.Some stalls are run 
 by car manufacturers.                 
 The arena is set aside for            
 displays.There is also a fair and the 
 atmosphere is one of great fun for all
 the family.                           </content>
