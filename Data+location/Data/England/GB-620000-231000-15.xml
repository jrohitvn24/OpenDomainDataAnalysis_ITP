		<title>15COPPERAS WOOD -IMPRESSIONS</title>
		<content> "On the 19th June 1985 we went to     
 Copperas Wood.We had to keep to the   
 path as the Government has designated 
 the wood as an{Area of Scientific     
{Interest,}because it so rare.         
 As you walk through the wood you can  
 hear the birds singing in the trees.  
 It is very peaceful apart from the    
 faint sounds of traffic and trains.A  
 dark and cool place full of life.     
 We crossed the railway bridge and came
 to the shore. There was a thin mist   
 floating over the water, cutting us   
 off from the 20th century. We were    
 completely cut off from other people, 
 nobody to bother us, in our own       
 world.A fishy smell, a smell of salt  
 and seaweed touched our nosrils. The  
 receeding tide had exposed the mud    
 revealing crabs, small fish and other 
 creatures. Its a lovely place to go."
