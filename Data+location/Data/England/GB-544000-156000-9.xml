		<title>09Footpaths in Knockholt</title>
		<content> Being entirely rural the area abounds 
 in footpaths lined by trees and hedges
 or small copses or skirting farmland. 
 Access is usually by gate or stile    
 with a request to respect the land and
 not to damage crops or remove wild    
 flowers. The footpaths provide a means
 of commuinication between houses and  
 farms, and recreation, in that, people
 are able to enjoy the countryside.    
 School parties gain valuable knowledge
 about farming and the enviroment by   
 using these paths. Local horses are   
 exercised along them - also those     
 brought in by horse box from less     
 rural areas. Hikers enjoy not only the
 lesser paths, but the well used and   
 ever popular{"North Downs Way"}on the 
 crest of the Downs going from Farnham 
 to Canterbury and Rochester, and the  
 "Pilgrims Way" at the foot of the     
 Downs.                                </content>
