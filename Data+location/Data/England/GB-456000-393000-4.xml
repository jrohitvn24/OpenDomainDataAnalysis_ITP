		<content> 60 per cent of{housing}in Tickhill has
 been built since 1961,and about 40 per
 cent since 1971. This extensive       
 building has caused the number of     
 dwellings to rise from about 850 in   
 1961 to just over 2000 in 1985.Most of
 the older buildings are clustered     
 around the Buttercross or line the    
 main streets.Many of them are         
 difficult to age,some are of{medieval}
 foundation.There are several good     
 examples of tall elegant{18th century}
 houses especially along Sunderland    
 Street.Many of the older houses are   
 made of stone.Some are made not with  
 dressed stone but with poor stone and 
 have had to be rendered or repointed. 
 Many of the new houses have been built
 in{estates}around the village.These   
 mainly family houses have been built  
 from brick.New houses amongst older   
 buildings are built from stone.       </content>
