		<title>18TRAFFIC SURVEY COWPEN BLYTH.</title>
		<content>  Two roads run on two sides of Bebside
 Middle School: the A189 a dual        
 carriageway which is the main arterial
 road of S.E.Northumberland and the    
 A193 (a single carriageway) linking   
 the A189 with the town of Blyth and   
 more especially Bates Colliery.       
   It was noted after two surveys in   
 the early afternoon of two weekdays   
 that the minor road ,A193, was more   
 heavily used by both cars and         
 commercial vehicles.The H.G.V. rate   
 for this road was 30% of the total    
 usage, with approximately 33% of these
 transporting coal from the colliery or
 returning empty.                      
   The A193 is immediately outside the 
 school gates. Between 900 to 1000     
 vehicles pass the gates each hour with
 296 H.G.V.'s per hour during the      
 school day.                           
                                       </content>
