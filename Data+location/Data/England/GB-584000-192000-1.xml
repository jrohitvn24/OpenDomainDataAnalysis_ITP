		<content> HOCKLEY IS A SMALL TOWN WHICH IS      
 UNDERGOING CHANGE. IT IS ON THE MAIN  
 RAILWAY LINE TO LONDON AND THEREFORE  
 THIS HAS A CONSIDERABLE EFFECT UPON   
 HOUSE PRICES. A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE
 INHABITANTS COMMUTE TO WORK. IT IS A  
 PLEASANT ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO LIVE 
 AND IS ACCESSIBLE TO LARGE LOCAL URBAN
 CENTRES ASWELL AS PLACES OF           
 EMPLOYMENT. IT HAS UNDERGONE A GREAT  
 DEAL OF DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LAST FEW 
 YEARS AND THIS WILL CONTINUE IN THE   
 NEAR FUTURE. THE AREA IS SERVED BY    
 LOCAL SHOPPING CENTRES AND THE TOWN   
 CENTRE ITSELF, ALTHOUGH THIS IS       
 LIMITED IN THE TYPE OF SHOPS AND      
 OFFICES. A SECONDARY SCHOOL SERVES THE
 TOWN ITSELF AND THE SMALLER VILLAGES  
 TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
