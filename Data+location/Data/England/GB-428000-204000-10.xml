		<content> Father and son manage the{racing      
{stables}whilst another son runs the   
 farming side. The{farmhouse}is{400}   
 years old. The farmland was drained in
 the late 1930's but the soil is       
 still heavy. There are stables for 25 
 horses and training costs around Â£100 
 a week. 5 or 6 grooms are employed.   
 The farm also has{breeding mares}and  
 rears its own{foals}. Horses flat race
 from 2-6 years and steeple chase until
 11. The trainer attends race meetings 
 regularly and takes{identity cards}for
 his horses and grooms for{security}.  
 The horses are very valuable. A       
 promising foal may be worth{Â£15,000}at
 3 months. The farm is 122 hectares and
 employs 2 men. They grow 56H Winter   
 Wheat,23H Winter Barley,4H Oats for   
 horses. It costs Â£40,000 to grow 200  
 acres of corn. 25% of the cost is due 
 to spraying.                          </content>
