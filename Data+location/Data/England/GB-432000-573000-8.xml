		<title>08 BRIERDENE FARM</title>
		<content>  Agriculture has had an important part
 to play in this area for many years.  
 Early settlers were atracted by its   
 flat well-drained,fertile soil. Early 
 farms provided foodstuffs for the     
 local priory at Tynemouth and then the
 rapidly growing urban centres of      
 Tyneside. Brierdene Farm is an arable 
 farm situated 2.5km north of the      
 growing conurbation of north Tyneside 
 It takes its name from the nearby     
 Brierdene which drains mineland and   
 flows Eastwards into the N. sea.      
 The farm is 500 acres,employs 2 full  
 time workers and is extremely         
 mechanised,with machines ranging from 
 small grasscutters to large combine   
 harvesters.300 acres are dedicated to 
 wheat with barley and oats and oilseed
 rape being the other main crops.The   
 busiest time of year is between       
 August and September during harvest.  </content>
