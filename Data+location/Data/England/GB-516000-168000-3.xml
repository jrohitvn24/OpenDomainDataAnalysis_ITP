		<title>03CORONATION STONE, KINGSTON</title>
		<content> The stone stands opposite the         
 Guildhall and is next to the Hogsmill 
 River.  Seven{Anglo-Saxon}kings were  
 crowned at Kingston.  It is about 1m  
 by 0.79m high.  It is grey with blue  
 railings round it with posts at every 
 metre.  The stone itself is over a    
 thousand years old.  There is a sign  
 with three fishes on it, this is the  
 badge of Kingston.  The following list
 shows which Kings were crowned and the
 year in which they were crowned:-     
{Edward the Elder,}son of Alfred the   
 Great (900),{Athlestan}(925),{Edmund} 
 (940),{Edred}(946),{Edwy}(956),{Edward
{the Martyr}(975) and{Ethelred II}     
 (979).  A silver penny of the reign of
 each of these kings was set into the  
 plinth of the stone, probably in 1850.
