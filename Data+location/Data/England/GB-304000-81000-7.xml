 Doctor Taylor has been a doctor for   
 thirteen years.We asked him about the 
 care of peoples health in Budleigh    
 Salteron.He said that there are four  
 doctors and 2 dentists in the town and
 that the main problems with elderly   
 people are arthritis;heart and lung   
 diseases and cancer.Young people      
 suffer mainly from infectious diseases
 ,asthma and appendicitis.             
 The town has a Health Centre, where   
 doctors have their surgeries, and a   
 cottage hospital.                     
 The hospital has 24 beds and 2 single 
 rooms with a staff of 14 nurses.About 
 400 people are admitted each year and 
 it is very comfortable, although      
 patients are expected to do some      
 things for themselves.                
 There are two nursing homes in the    
 town;St Cecilias and Bay Court.       </content>
