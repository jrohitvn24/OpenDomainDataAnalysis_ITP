		<title>11COWLEY AND BROWN'S CHARITY</title>
		<content>      In 1725 Thomas Cowley made a     
 bequest that rents from certain lands 
 should be used to endow Quadring      
 School and for the assistance of needy
 and infirm persons.                   
      One of the people entrusted to   
 see to this was one Edward Brown. He  
 too left land to be used in a similar 
 manner.                               
      This money is now looked after by
 a group of local people known as the  
 Trustees. Each year they provide money
 for Christmas boxes for               
 pensioners.Money is also made         
 available to people who are receiving 
 education and need to purchase books  
 etc.                                  
      Quadring Cowley and Brown's      
 Primary School regularly receives help
 from this charity.
