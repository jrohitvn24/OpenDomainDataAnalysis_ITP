 1 acre of land, originally 20 acres.  
 Until 19th century it was surrounded  
 by Common Land, now farmland.The house
 is listed because of unusual murals   
 painted on the staircase panelling.   
 They are of little angels;in Victorian
 times they were covered by curtains,  
 ladies should not look.In a bedroom is
 a painting of The Fire of London,this 
 was painted in about 1666.In 1774

 the owner,William Sheperd.The plaque

 seen.The house is still being         
 investigated by the Essex County      
 Council Archives.
