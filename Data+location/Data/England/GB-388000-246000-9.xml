		<title>09Deerfold Wood Wadborough.</title>
		<content> In Wadborogh we saw quite a lot of    
 wildlife in the wood .In Deerfold     
 wood we saw a few animals and ground  
 birds such as{pheasants}and{partridges
 .The name Deerfold wood indicates that
 there might have been{deer}in wood at 
 one time but we could not see any     
 signs of them. We found some{rabbit   
 burrows in the wood and we found a    
 shell of a hazel nut that had been    
 partly eaten by a{wood vole.}We also  
 found some{fox}tracks and think we saw
 a{fox.}We saw two{partridges,}a male  
 and a female. In the grass we saw what
 we think was a{grass snake}. In the   
 trees there was a{grey squirrel}so if 
 it was not a{wood vole}that ate the   
 hazel nut it could of been a{squirrel.
