		<content>    Cutting right across the area,from 
 the northeast to the southwest is the 
 New Chelmsford Bypass. This is in the 
 process of being built,but it is      
 destroying the country side and       
 cutting through good farming land.    
    Most of the roads are narrow and   
 have very little traffic except for   
 the A130 Chelmsford to Southend, which
 is a very busy road.                  
    There is a small commuter village  
 at Howe Green,but there are no shops  
 or schools, only one small chapel.    
 Most of the houses are fairly new,    
 being built in the last twenty years  
 or so, and a few old houses, which    
 were probably farm cottages.          
    The other houses in our area are   
 mainly the older individual types of  
 property. Some have land attached and 
 a few animals such as chickens and    
 goats.                                </content>
