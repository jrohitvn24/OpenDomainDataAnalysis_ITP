		<title>16Housing In Harley</title>
		<content>{Harley}is split into{three}sections   
 of{housing.}First there are the{old   
{stone cottages,}then there are the    
{council houses}and last there are the 
{new private houses.}The{old stone     
{cottages}look very pretty and most of 
 them have been{modernised}now to make 
 them comfortable inside. Most of the  
 people who live in them have lived in 
{Harley}for a long time. The{council   
{houses}are all built along one road   
 and some of them are{old peoples      
{bungalows.}The{modern private houses  
 are all at one end of the village and 
 they are a mixture of{houses}and      
{bungalows.}The shops, pub and church  
 are all in the{old}part of the        
 village. The people we spoke to all   
 liked living in{Harley}and didn't want
 it to change. I think{Harley}is a nice
 quiet village but I would{not}like    
 to live there  my self.               </content>
