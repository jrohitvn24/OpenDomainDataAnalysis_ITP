 those who do,most work part-time to   
 suit school hours.Fewer mothers work  
 full-time.Some people work in         
 factories producing chemical goods or 
 electrical goods.Other people work in 
 offices and shops.Quite a few people  
 work in our school.Some of the men and
 boys work as tradesmen in the shipyard

 farms.A small number of people own    
 their own businesses.By far the most
