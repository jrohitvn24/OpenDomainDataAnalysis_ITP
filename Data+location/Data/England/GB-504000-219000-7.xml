		<content>The following observations were made on
life on Farley Hill Estate. These views
were expressed by a group of 12/13 year
olds, 25 in all.  They felt generally  
happy about living on the estate, one  
described it as quiet, clean and       
friendly.  The group was pleased with  
the recent addition of a BMX track, a  
sort of cross-country area for bikes.  
A number of requests for more things to
do in the evenings and at night were   
made.  A majority would like some extra
facilities such as a cinema or youth   
club.                                  
Four members commented adversely on    
ethnic minority groups but this        
unfortunate reflection of racialism was
eclipsed by the feelings of most who   
were happy with their homes and        
neighbours.
