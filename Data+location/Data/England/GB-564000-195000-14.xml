   A group of shops, serving local     
 needs, has grown up at the junction of
 Radford Way and Perry Street. These   
 include a newsagent, a hardware store,
 a greengrocer and a butcher. The only 
 public house within the grid is also  
 sited at this junction. It is a modern
 building called "The Pilgrim", a      
 reference to Billericay's association 
 with the Pilgrim Fathers who sailed in
 the Mayflower.                        
{Radford Way                           
{ }The approach to the railway station 
 has its own row of shops. These       
 include a hairdresser, bookshop,      
 plumbers' supplies, fishing tackle,   
 car spare parts and a newsagent. A    
 garage/petrol station is well sited   
 for the station car parks.
