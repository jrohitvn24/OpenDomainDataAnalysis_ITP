		<title>11MY NEW HOUSE IN HOOK</title>
		<content> My name is Fiona and I am new to      
 Hook, having lived on the Martin Grant
 Estate for just a year.The roads are  
 cul-de-sacs and are all still uneven  
 and unsurfaced. The builders say they 
 are going to finish them when the     
 whole estate is complete.So in summer 
 they are dusty and in winter muddy.At 
 the entrance is a showhouse with nice 
 furniture in it.My house has 3 toilets
 2 bathrooms 4 bedrooms 2 garages study
 with computer and utility room.The    
 smallest bedroom is used as a TV room 
 and for playing games on my computer. 
 Our bedrooms are all fitted with lots 
 of cupboards-my brother Alistair even 
 has them under his bed.Our house would
 cost about Â£80000 to buy now,when we  
 moved in it was only Â£65000 but, of   
 course, we have planted the garden    
 with lots of shrubs and a lawn so that
 it is very attractive.                </content>
