		<title>02PILSLEY EMPLOYMENT - MINING</title>
		<content> A survey of the employment of the     
 fathers of the children at Pilsley    
 Primary School showed that 24% work   
 for the National Coal Board in the    
 mining industry in jobs ranging from  
 coal-face workers to colliery         
 technicians and engineers. Formerly   
 the N.C.B. employed a larger          
 percentage of Pilsley men when the    
 local colliery was working, but it has
 now been closed for some years.       
                                       
 The N.C.B. workers are now spread     
 amongst eight collieries, two N.C.B.  
 workshops &amp; plant maintenance depots, 
 and the National Smokeless Fuel Plant.
                                       
 The majority of Pilsley miners work at
 the Silverhill, Markham and Arkwright 
 collieries.
