		<title>10New Silksworth (cont)</title>
		<content>  The majority of working men have to  
 travel outside of{Silksworth}in order 
 to find work. There are good bus      
 services into{Sunderland}and the      
 surounding districts. About 60% of    
 familes in{New Silksworth}own a car.  
  New buildings in the village include 
 a{health centre}and a{private housing 
{estate}near the{cricket field.        
  At the present time a new{junior     
{school}is being built to replace the  
 present buildings which are 110 years 
 old. it is interesting to compare the 
 cost of the new school, which will    
 accommodate 350 children, with the    
{miners' hall}in{Blind Lane}which was  
 built in 1893 for public entertainment
 and could hold 900 people. In 1893 the
{miners' hall}cost Â£3, 300. in 1985 the
 cost of the new school is estimated at
 almost Â£1,000,000.
