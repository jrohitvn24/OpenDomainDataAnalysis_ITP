		<title>08A FEN EDGE FARM</title>
		<content>    Chalk Farm covers an area of 480   
 acres and was established on former   
 common fields and old heath as a      
 result of parliamentary Enclosure. The
 area is predominantly chalk and the   
 top-soil produces a medium loam.      
    The farm consists of only four     
 large fields. Each is between 96 and  
 126 acres in size. The fields have    
 always been this size and have not    
 recently been made larger to cope with
 modern machinery.                     
    The fields are bounded by hedges   
 which contain some trees. There were  
 many elm trees, but they were killed  
 by Dutch Elm disease. New trees such  
 as American Oaks are being planted to 
 replace them; there are also many     
 beech trees.                          
    This has always been an open area, 
 without much woodland.
