		<title>05TOURISM IN HARDWICK</title>
		<content>{ Hardwick Hall}has dominated the area 
 for nearly four hundred years. Along  
 with the estate and parkland it is now
 managed by the{National Trust.}It     
 comes as no surprise, therefore,      
 that{tourism}is perhaps the area's    
 greatest industry.                    
  The Hall itself lures over 55        
 thousand visitors each year and when  
 one sees it towering magnificently    
 over the miles of parkland the reason 
 is immediately obvious.               
  The{parkland}attached to the Hall    
 plays host to hundreds of thousands of
 visitors each year. They come to{fish 
 in the rivers,{canoe,}follow the      
{nature walks}or merely enjoy a family 
{picnic}and relax in the beautiful     
 countryside.
