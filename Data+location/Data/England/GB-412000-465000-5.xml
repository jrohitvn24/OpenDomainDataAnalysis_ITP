		<title>05Tourism: Pateley</title>
		<content>  Pateley Bridge often enters a        
 competition called Britain in Bloom.  
 The competition's aim is to make the  
 environment more attractive by        
 encouraging the planting of flowers   
 and shrubs. This also improves the    
 number of tourists because people are 
 attracted to the town. The flowers are
 judged in spring, mid-summer and late 
 August. The parks department of       
 Harrogate looks after the plants and  
 supplies them from their huge green-  
 houses. Their gardeners produce the   
 hanging baskets of flowers and they   
 are then brought and hung around the  
 town. Â£10 is paid by each shop for the
 flowers. Local farmers have given old 
 hayracks and stone troughs to put the 
 flowers in. Even the river is checked 
 for litter. The competition has made  
 Pateley a much brighter town to live  
 in and visit.                         </content>
