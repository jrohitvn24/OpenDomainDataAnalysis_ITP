		<content> More and more{sheep}are appearing in  
 local fields, river banks and         
 churchyards as farmers take advantage 
 of{Common Market}subsidies. A local   
 Ministry of Agriculture spokesman     
 said,"Sheep farming is becoming very  
 profitable. The pig market is         
 unpredictable and dairy farming is    
 very costly." Mr. George Hoyles who   
 farms with his father and brother at  
 Newton and keeps 300 sheep said,"Dairy
 farmers have suffered because of milk 
 quotas, so more sheep are being kept  
 in the fens. I use a new type of      
 electric fencing which enables me to  
 move sheep more easily all around the 
 farm." But Mr. Hoyles did warn that   
 E.E.C. guaranteed prices for sheep    
 might not last for ever. The current  
 value of a good ewe is Â£50 to Â£60.
