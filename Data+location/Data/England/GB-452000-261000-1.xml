		<title>01Summary of our block</title>
		<content>Our block has Staverton, part of the   
Grange Estate ,Fords ,some small       
factory units and many acres of farm   
land. The farms grow wheat and barley  
mainly and rear cattle and sheep.      
Farmers take their animals to the      
markets at Banbury ,Rugby and          
Northampton. There may be a lot of farm
land but there are not many farm houses
and barns asd such. The only woods are 
two small ones near Staverton.Staverton
wood is on top of Big Hill and contains
mainly oak ,ash ,birch and pine trees. 
                                       
The main hills in the block are Big    
Hill, Staverton Clump and the hill that
Staverton is on.                       
                                       
West of Staverton lies the remains of  
the old railway line which was closed  
15years ago .It has been dismantled    
now. It ran from S.W to N.E.           </content>
