		<content> A long time ago the council wanted    
 lots of houses for low cost, so they  
 designed {Terraced houses}which are   
 plain and colourless. They are cramped
 inside and all look the same. The{    
{front gardens}are small. They are     
 generally uncared for, perhaps because
 the owners are at work, and are not   
 interested or do not have enough money
 for plants and equipment. Some gardens
 are looked after but their appearance 
 is spoiled by rubbish and vandalism.  
 Many houses have multi-occupation     
 which leads to problems about the use 
 of the gardens. Because of {Noise and 
{Dirt}and the lack of a pleasant view  
 no-one sits in the front gardens.     
 Noise and dirt go together in the     
 streets of Wood Green. Traffic,       
 annimals, humans; everything in its   
 own way destroys the peace.
