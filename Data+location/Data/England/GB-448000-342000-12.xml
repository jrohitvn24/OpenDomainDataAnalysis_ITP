		<title>12 Preserving Strelley Hall</title>
		<content> Marian Henshell says:                 
   "We have to have permission to      
 alter the outside of the hall. In fact
 all we've done is alter the old       
 kitchen by putting in four new        
 windows.                              
   We can do what we like to the inside
 of the hall but we want to preserve   
 it. We've made certain rooms into     
 offices. In fact, even Miss Edge's    
 bathroom we've made into an office.   
 But if we've moved anything we've     
 always tried to use it elsewhere, even
 the brass taps. We've altered the     
 stables very little. We've kept the   
 stalls and the mangers and the hay    
 racks and the floor. All the panelling
 from the stables we have used to panel
 the lower parts of the walls in our   
 new lounge, which used to be the      
 servants' hall and the housekeeper's  
 room and store rooms."                </content>
