		<title>15GAMES CHILDREN PLAY IN RIPON</title>
		<content>  The games children play in a         
 playground vary depending on age.The  
 young children,5-8 year olds would    
 play games like tig,stuck in the mud  
 and hide'n'seek which are the most    
 popular,but there are many more.      
 Children at 8-11 years would play     
 cricket,football,blockey,peggy,tennis 
 and french cricket,these are the most 
 popular for this age group.           
 Children that are 12-15 years old     
 seem to lose interest in these games. 
 Games children play also differ from  
 school to school.At one school a game 
 may be popular at another school it   
 may not.
