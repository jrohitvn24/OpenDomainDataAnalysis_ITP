		<title>09BELLRINGING LT.WALTHAM II</title>
		<content>  I am a member of the{Little Waltham  
{Bellringers.}There are about a dozen  
 members,the youngest being ten and the
 oldest is in his fifties.             
     We ring on Wednesdays and Sundays 
 plus special occasions like weddings  
 for which we recive Â£2.               
     I ring the second bell of a set of
 6.I have been ringing for eight months
 but I have not as yet been in any     
 competitions.We have an annual        
 striking competition with other       
 churches,this is ringing different    
 methods.We are marked as sound,order  
 and if not clipping' (bells not       
 conecting each other).                
     The bells in my church have       
 inscriptions on them all telling      
 it's own story.                       
    Eg.the treble has "Alfred Bowell   
 made me and hung us all." 1935
