		<title>07THE CROASDELLS-HOLKER MOSS</title>
		<content>   The{Croasdells}have lived in the    
 area since the 15th century and were  
 paupers.Now Mrs.Croasdell owns a      
 small house called "Grassgarth" just  
 south of Bigland Hall Estate.She has  
 lived there for 61 years.In her youth 
 she would play on land owned by the   
 Biglands and was frequently chased off
 by the patrolling gamekeeper.The only 
 disturbance to the peace now is caused
 by low-flying military aircraft on    
 training runs.The local dialect       
 describes the land as being "bony" or 
 rough,rocky and uncultivated.Mrs.     
 Croasdell looks at today's youth and  
 believes that children's attitudes    
 have not changed over the years but   
 that they are more restricted in their
 actions..."when you saw a can you used
 to kick it,it was the natural thing to
 do.Nowadays children are brought up   
 being told not to do this and that".  </content>
