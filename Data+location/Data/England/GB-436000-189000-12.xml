		<title>12Life as a Cub Scout W.Grove</title>
		<content> On 24th May, I went on a cub camp at  
 Didcot Power Station Reserve. On      
 arrival we made our beds and pitched  
 our tents.  After lunch of stew and   
 dumplings was an inspection and some  
 football. On our return we cooked fish
 fingers and spaghetti.  Then we had 15
 minutes free time.  Bedtime was at    
 10.00 pm. In the morning, we had      
 Inspection, then breakfast. We worked 
 on our Scientist Badge. On the last   
 day, I was judged the tidiest,        
 cleanest Cub Scout and won a shield.  
 Other summer events included a St.    
 George's Day Parade on April 28th,    
 when Scouts and Cubs marched to       
 Wantage Church, a District Rally at   
 Uffington, when all the packs had     
 games on White Horse Hill, and the    
 District Athletics when we all        
 competed against each other.
