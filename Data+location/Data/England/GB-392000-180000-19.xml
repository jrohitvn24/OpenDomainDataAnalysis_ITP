		<title>19Sunday.</title>
		<content> On a Sunday morning I try to stay in  
 bed for as long as possible because   
 Sunday's are totally boring.When I    
 finally climb out of bed I feed the   
 cat,then I get dressed but I don't    
 have any breakfast.When Mum gets up I 
 ask her if she can make the dinner for
 3.00.I ask her that because my        
 programmes start at 2.00 and finish at
 3.00,so then I won't get so bored.When
 I have finally conquered my boredom by
 playing with a ball,I do a crossword  
 which is in the paper.The reason I get
 so bored is because there are no      
 activities for children in Corston and
 no-one my age to play with.At 7.00 I  
 watch programmes until 9.00,then go   
 to bed.Another Sunday gone by.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
