		<content> At half-past six in the morning my dad
 gets up to milk the cows, it takes    
 about an hour. First he fills two     
 buckets with warm water to wash the   
 cows' udders to prevent germs getting 
 into the milk. After dad has wiped the
 udder clean he puts the milkers on.   
 Then he switches  them on , he has to 
 pull down a lever and push a switch on
 the milkers anticlockwise this will   
 start milking. After the cow has been 
 milked the udders have a liquid which 
 stops them from chapping. After dad   
 has finished he goes in and has       
 breakfast. Mum is a milk recorder and 
 she sometimes milks the cows for dad. 
 After breakfast dad goes and turns the
 hay to help it dry quicker. Then he   
 puts the cows out in a field. In the  
 afternoon he bales the hay and stores 
 it in a barn.In the evening dad milks 
 the cows again.He goes to bed at ten. </content>
