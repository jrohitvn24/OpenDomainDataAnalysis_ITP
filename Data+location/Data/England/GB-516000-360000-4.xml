		<content>{TRADE IN WOODHALL SPA}                
 Woodhall boasts some 80 different     
 businesses;foodshops of all variety,  
 shoes,clothes,bedding,gifts,dairy,wine
 ,Building Societies,banks,estate      
 agents,public houses,hotels etc.We    
 have some first class builders,hotels 
 and one very good nursing home.We also
 have four good retirment homes.The    
 general trade in the Spa has been very
 good in the last ten years or so,but  
 it is now more difficult to maintain, 
 owing to the large stores.Tourism is  
 beginning to play a an important part 
 in our trade at the Spa and in the    
 last 2 years has helped tremendously. 
 It should help the Spa to maintain the
 high standard of business already here
 but it is doubtful if it would support
 new shops.The Spa needs to expand in  
 its development of new houses to enjoy
 the present trend of trade.           </content>
