		<title>11UNEMPLOYMENT-CRAFT REVIVAL</title>
		<content>   When the work force at the giant    
 Rank Xerox plant at Mitcheldean was   
 drastically cut, some three years ago,
 the unemployment caused was severe,   
 although relatively few in our area   
 were affected.                        
   Finding new jobs in a rural area is 
 very difficult, and many have turned  
 to old crafts as an occupation.       
   One very thriving small business was
 started in this way when a{Gunsmith's 
 workshop was opened in{Barrell Lane.  
   There is now a work-force of three  
 and the business has expanded to      
 include not only repair work but also 
 the making of shotguns and rifles, and
 the provision of shooting tuition,    
 thus catering for members of the      
 shooting syndicates and the Clay      
 Pigeon clubs.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
