		<title>15INCORPORATION OF STRAW</title>
		<content>   Farms are doing a lot of work on    
 straw incorporation and this method of
 disposal is being used increasingly.  
 It is not a quick or cheap method of  
 disposal, to achive the best          
 incorporation the straw needs to be   
{chopped finely}and this is done either
 with a chopper on the back of a       
 combine or by a separate machine drawn
 by a tractor. At the same time it     
 needs to be spread widely across the  
 field and incorporated as soon as     
 possible. The important element is    
 thoroughly mixing the straw with the  
 soil. Loss of production results      
 from straw incorporation, the farmer  
 is faced with{capital expenditure}on  
 extra machinery, added manpower and   
 fuel costs and a delay in getting on  
 to the land to start autumn drilling  
 and at the moment no clear idea of the
 long term effect on the land.         </content>
