		<title>14LANGTON HOUSING</title>
		<content> There are many different types of     
 houses;houses that have been owned for
 several generations by one family and 
 houses that are new and modern with   
 wonderful appliances. Some buildings  
 were designed as barns, coach houses  
 etc. but have now been converted into 
 homes. Most of the modern houses are  
 either detached or semi-detached and  
 many of these are owned by commuters. 
 There are terraced houses, mainly     
 occupied by elderly people, because   
 they are small and therefore are      
 relatively easy and cheap to run; also
 it is good for old people to have     
 other people living near at hand.     
 There are not many flats the few there
 that exist are mainly occupied by     
 elderly people and young families.    
 There are only a few bungalows in the 
 village. There are also quite a lot of
 large expensive houses in the village.</content>
