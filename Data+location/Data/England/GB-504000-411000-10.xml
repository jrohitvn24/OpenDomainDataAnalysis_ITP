		<title>10FOX HUNTING IN Melton Ross</title>
		<content>  This section of the county (a square 
 4 Kms to east and 3 Kms to north of   
 1104) is hunted by the Brocklesby Hunt
 Foxhounds.Due to the new roads the    
 Hunt will now only hunt in this area  
 once or twice during the season.The   
 hunt meets every wednesday and        
 saturday.                             
 There are 35 couples of hounds which  
 are the property of the Earl of       
 Yarborough.                           
 This hunt dates back to approx.1700.  
 The 1st. Earl of Y. was master of the 
 foxhounds in 1816 and currently since 
 1967 the present Earl is joint master,
 with Mr M F Strawson.                 
 At this time many people regard fox   
 hunting as cruel and are campaigning  
 to get it banned ,but most local      
 residents are sympathetic to fox      
 hunting because it is part of the     
 heritage and way of life of the area. </content>
