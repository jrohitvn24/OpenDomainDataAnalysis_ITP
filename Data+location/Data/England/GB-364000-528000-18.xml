		<content> Milburn school is situated at the top 
 end of the Green.The present building 
 was erected in 1851 after the previous
 one was burned down by one of the     
 scholars;it had a thatched roof at    
 that time.The present school is built 
 of sandstone with a slate roof. It has
 one classroom with a cloakroom/kitchen
 attatched. Outside there are 2 toilets
 and 3 small storerooms.There is no    
 playground so the pupils use part of  
 the village green .The Headmistress   
 is the only full time teacher, and a  
 part time teacher comes in for        
 1.5 days per week.Monday - Friday the 
 school is open and begins at 9.00 a.m.
 &amp; finishes at 3.30 p.m.The children   
 start during the academic year in     
 which they are 5,and at the age of

 choice to attend schools in Penrith.
