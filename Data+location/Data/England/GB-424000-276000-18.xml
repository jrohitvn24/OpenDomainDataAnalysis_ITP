		<title>18TRAFFIC SURVEY IN TILE HILL</title>
		<content> We did a traffic survey of the traffic
 which uses the three main roads in    
 Tile Hill Village. Our survey was done
 in three separate groups in the       
 afternoon. There were exactly the same
 number of buses in Station Avenue as  
 in Tile Hill Lane but as this part of 
 Torrington Avenue is not a bus route  
 we did not see any buses. There were  
 very similar numbers of cars, vans,   
 lorries and motorcycles in these first
 two streets as these are the two      
 routes which carry traffic from       
 Coventry, through Tile Hill Village,  
 towards Kenilworth. Torrington Avenue 
 is much busier in the mornings and in 
 late afternoons than the rest of the  
 day as there are many small industrial
 units along this street. There were   
 more pedestrians on Tile Hill Lane but
 we discovered that they were going to 
 a mother and baby clinic that day!    </content>
