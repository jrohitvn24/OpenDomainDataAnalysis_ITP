		<content> Some of the older, retired people who 
 have lived and worked in Thorner over 
 a long period of time were asked about
 changes which they had seen during the
 20th Century.                         
                                       
 They said that new innovations and    
 ideas had only been accepted slowly.  
                                       
 Farmers had supplied most produce for 
 the village, there was little need to 
 go out of Thorner to shops. Until the 
 1960's there had been a railway, but a
 regular bus service from the Beehive  
 public house had taken over.          
 Some remembered horse drawn transport 
 in the village...until 1962 a horse   
 called Prince regularly pulled a malt 
 cart in Thorner.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
