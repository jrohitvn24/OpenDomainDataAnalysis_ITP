		<content> VISIT TO GRANGE FARM                  
   We were told an interesting story   
 about monks from a long time ago.     
 The monks used to smuggle the catholic
 people into the monastery,away from   
 the soldiers.They used to take them   
 down the secret passage to the Boat   
 House.They got a boat and sailed to   
 France.                               
 WALBOTTLE ROAD                        
   The bank between Walbottle and      
 Newburn is steep.At the bottom of the 
 green in Walbottle is a restored horse
 trough.Horses used to stop for a      
 drink after pulling heavy loads up the
 hill.                                 
 THE ROMAN WALL                        
   The Wall was built by Emperor       
 Hadrians'soldiers.Ruins of the wall   
 were found in 1929.At that time there 
 was an apple tree growing in the      
 middle of sections of the wall.       </content>
