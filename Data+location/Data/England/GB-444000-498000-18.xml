		<title>18BRIT TELECOM RELAY STATION</title>
		<content> The British Telecom relay station GR  
 459996 stands at the top of the steep 
 slopes of Arncliffe woods overlooking 
 the village of Ingleby Arncliffe.It is
 one of the national network of 191    
 relay stations used to send telephone 
 messages and some T.V.pictures around 
 the country.Because this station is in
 a National Park area,none of the      
 reception dishes or transmitters can  
 be over 20 metres high and therefore  
 32 dishes are necessary to relay the  
 microwave signals from Newcastle to   
 Leeds.The station is 25 years old and 
 we were the first visitors to be      
 allowed in.T.V.cameras and local radio
 were there to record the visit as well
 as some journalists from local        
 newspapers.Inside the station there is
 a standby generator with a 4 litre    
 engine producing 129 bhp. This is used
 in the event of power failure.        </content>
