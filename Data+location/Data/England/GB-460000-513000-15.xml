		<title>15Local Government-Guisborough</title>
		<content> The town's pop.of 20000 is increasing 
 as dormitory for Teesside 10 m.away.  
 3 local govt.tiers affect Guisb: the  
 parish;Langbaurgh DC;Cleveland CC.Our 
 amenity survey went to parents of stu-
 dents at the 6th form college; 50     
 forms were returned.Only 37 could name
 their MP (Holt) &amp; only 12 their Euro- 
 MP (Vanneck),many misspelling the     
 latter.Of their local contribution    
 most felt they'd done little.They were
 said to be'noticeable by their abs-   
 ence'.On 2.5.85,C.Council elections   
 were held.28 voted,with 15 voting for 
 local issues;18 on national. About the
 town,there was much dissatisf.with    
 local amenits.(see next page). It was 
 felt the town had expanded enough:    
 46 said No more.Of course our survey  
 wasn't a cross section; parents of 6th
 formers are not typical; nor are form 
 fillers,of those who cant be bothered.</content>
