		<title>13A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content>My mum wakes me up at about 7.30am.For 
my breakfast I eat Shreddies with cold 
milk and sugar followed by a cup of    
tea.I have to set off to go to school  
at 8.40 as it starts at 9.00.          
When we get to school the teacher      
checks the register to see who is      
present,after that we go to a religious
assembly.After assembly we have 4      
lessons each lasting half an hour.Lunch
time lasts for 1 hour,I stay for school
meals,there is a choice of 3 first     
courses and 3 sweets.It costs 2 pounds 
to stay for dinners for 1 week.        
When lunch is over we have 4 more half 
hour lessons.We take subjects such as  
Mathematics,English,French,Science,P.E.
Craft Design Technology,Geography,R.E. 
History,Art,Music,Home Economics,and   
some pupils take German.               
Most nights I go straight home after   
school but sometimes stay for clubs.   </content>
