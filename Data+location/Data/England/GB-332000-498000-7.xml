		<content> The limited resident population of the
 Hawkshead area causes little trouble, 
 and law &amp; order are to a large extent 
 self-imposed. There is a police       
 station with 2 cells, and a small     
 magistrates court which sits on the   
 1st and 3rd Fridays of each month.    
 There are 6 magistrates on rota.      
 During the summer there is 1 sergeant 
 with 6 constables on the station      
 strength; in winter this is reduced to
 the sergeant and 3 constables. Their  
 main problem is traffic, and theft    
 from vehicles during the summer. In   
 1984 there were 189 crimes reported   
 and 104 prisoners held. 303 other     
 incidents were also reported.         
                                       
 Despite having a car park for 800 cars
 and 12 coaches, parking can be        
 difficult in summer when the car park 
 can often be full by 11 a.m.          </content>
