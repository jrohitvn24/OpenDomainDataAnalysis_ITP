 The area is predominately Middle Class
 with a commensurate life-style.  The  
 vast majority of housing is privately 
 owned. Most people leave the area for 
 their work, but take pride in their   
 home surroundings and enjoy a sense of
 community. This is particularly true  
 in Rottingdean and Ovingdean which    
 have an older population and less     
 geographical mobility. The pace of    
 life is slow. In Saltdean there is    
 less sense of a village community as  
 much of the housing is of recent      
 years. Every day family needs are     
 provided by ample shops but residents 
 tend to drive to Brighton for their   
 main week-end shopping.
