		<content> We have a garage which is next to some
 stables.Further on there is a large   
 farm building.Further still there is  
 an outdoor straw stack near a new cow 
 building.The cow building is connected
 to a silage pit.We also have 60 acres 
 of land which surrounds the house.Some
 of the land is used for growing       
 crops such as: barley,hay and         
 silage.The other land is used for     
 animal grazing,mostly for horses,     
 although cattle graze on it too.      
       There are two people in the     
 family who are interested in horses : 
 my elder sister and my mother.There   
 are six horses one pony and a goat.My 
 mum buys the horses as novices,works  
 them up to higher grades and          
 eventually sells them to another      
 yard.She goes showjumping between one 
 and four times a week.
