		<content>I am a{Catholic}and belong to SS Joseph
and Helen's Parish. Our church is in   
Station Road and Father Bouchier is our
{Parish Priest.} On the 29th April 1985
I received the{Gift of the Holy Spirit}
through the{Sacrament of Confirmation.}
I was Confirmed by {Bishop Cleary} and 
chose the name St Jane as a sign of    
becoming a {full member} of the Church.
Before we were confirmed, the bishop   
blessed us. My {sponsor} and I went to 
the {altar,} the bishop put her hand on
my right  shoulder, I said my          
{Confirmation Name,}  then the bishop  
said, "Jane be sealed with the gift of 
the Holy Spirit". I said, "Amen" and   
the bishop {anointed my forehead} with 
the {Oil of Christ.} It was a very     
special occasion for me, my family, my 
school and for my parish.
