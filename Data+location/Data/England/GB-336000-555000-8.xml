		<title>08A CARLISLE SUBURB &lt;1></title>
		<content>  Belle Vue is the name of the suburb  
 of Carlisle where I live.It is a plea-
 sant area,bordering onto open country-
 side.Most of Belle Vue is used for    
 housing and residential purposes but  
 the houses aren't too squashed up.This
 is because about twenty years ago     
 Belle Vue was mostly fields.Even now, 
 there are lots of parks and open      
 spaces which haven't been built       
 on.There are play areas which are     
 quite safe for young children and the 
 roads aren't very busy.I like living  
 in Belle Vue because nearly everywhere
 you look there are green open spaces. 
 Even when you are surrounded by houses
 you can see green grass in the gardens
 or by going down a road you are soon  
 in the open enjoying a walk in the    
 country.This is one of the advantages 
 of living in Belle Vue.Another is the 
 quietness of the roads.               </content>
