		<title>10LOCAL INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> There is very high unemployment around
 here, especially in Bacup, where it is
 over 25% on the Fairview Estate. Once 
 there were busy cotton mills which    
 provided jobs and prosperity for the  
 area, but when the cotton mills closed
 nothing really took their place.The   
 biggest industry is shoe and slipper  
 manufacture. There is Bacup Shoe      
 Company which is in our D-Block and   
 Hirsts Shoes, which is just outside   
 but many people from Stacksteads have 
 jobs there. Some of the old mills have
 been converted into small lots which  
 small businesses operate from. The    
 Government are trying to encourage    
 this and our area is an "Enterprise   
 Zone". People get special grants to   
 start up in business and this has     
 helped alot of people who had been    
 made redundant.
