		<content> The{Oxford Canal}crosses the area and 
 joins the{Coventry Canal}in the N.W.  
 corner of the block.No longer an      
 industrial route,it now carries       
 pleasure boats,both traditional and   
 modern.                               
 An arm to the south of the motorway is
 preserved for owners to moor and      
 repair their craft.                   
 Stops at Tusses Bridge, Hawkesbury and
 Sutton Stop  have been revitalised by 
 the canal societies and trusts to make
 an interesting amenity.               
 The Pump House and other interesting  
 buildings are being preserved and     
 canal rallies are often held.         
 Boat trips are also available.
