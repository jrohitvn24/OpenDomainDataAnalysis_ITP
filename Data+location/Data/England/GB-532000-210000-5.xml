 no school and I read until it was time
 to get up,then I got up,then I got    
 washed, and dressed and made my bed.  
 I went down for breakfast,of Weetabix,
 tea and toast,after which I took the  
 dog,Hoagy, a{Springer Spaniel,}for a  
 walk to buy some potatoes. When I     
 got home I finished the last of my    
 French homework,then I played on my   
 computer till lunch.After lunch I went
 to see a football match ({Totenham    
{Hotspur}v{Everton}) with my dad. We   
 went in his car_a Citreon BX. When we 
 got back from football, I had my      
 dinner of turkey breasts, potatoes and
 peas, and went to swimming gala at    
{Hatfield,}I was representing Ware     
 Swimming Club and won 2 of my races   
 one of which was 2 lengths backstroke.
 Then we went home. I went to bed at
