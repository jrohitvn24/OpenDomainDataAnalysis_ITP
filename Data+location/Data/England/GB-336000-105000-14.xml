 My Mum is called Cheryl.She works at  
 Winsham School as a dinner lady.After 
 dinner she looks after us at          
 playtime.Sometimes we go to play on   
 the playing field at dinner           
 playtime.After play Mum has her dinner
 in the School kitchen.Then she helps  
 Mrs Bone.After her dinner she goes    
 home.After school she comes and looks 
 after the Taxi people until the Taxi  
 comes.My Dad is called Mike.He works  
 in Yeovil at the Ace Project.He does  
 lots of other things.Most of the      
 people who work with him are punks.My 
 dad is sort of a teacher because he   
 teaches the punks to do things.The Ace
 Project is something like teenage     
 school really.It helps the school     
 leavers get a job.
