which had once been on the estate of   
Lord Leigh, from Mr. Bamford's uncle.  
They have done for eleven years.His    
uncle taught the skills of farming     
because his father hadn't been a       
farmer.Mr.Bamford had many jobs before 
going into farming.His ambition is to  
breed a Cheltenham Gold Cup            
winner.Mr.Bamford's farm is a stud farm
and has 13 horses including the        
foals.He doesn't use any machinery and 
has used the same method for working   
all the time he has rented the farm. He
used to have sheep on his farm but he  
changed them for cattle.He employs one 
person full-time and three people      
part-time.There are 8 mares,5 foals and
1 stallion.The foals are given         
nicknames and when they are a year old 
they are given racing names.They sell  
for 1,000-3,000 pounds.                </content>
