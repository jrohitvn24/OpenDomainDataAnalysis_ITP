		<title>08LAYER WATER WORKS</title>
		<content> These treatment works are owned by The
 Essex Water Company. The company      
 operates five principal treatment     
 works and a number of wells and bore  
 holes to supply a potable water to the
 southern part of Essex. Layer and     
 Langham Works can supply up to 200    
 Ml/day, approximately one third of the
 company's daily output. The main areas
 supplied are Witham, Chelmsford,      
 Brentwood, Grays, Tilbury.            
 Water is taken from the River Stour at
 Langham. It is pumped to a balancing  
 reservoir at Ardleigh. From Ardleigh  
 water gravitates the 8 miles to       
 Abberton Reservoir. The Layer Works   
 were built in 1939. Water flows from  
 Abberton Reservoir into Layer Pits and
 then into preliminary settling Tanks. 
 Water is filtered through sand and    
 chlorine and ammonia are added. The   
 treated water is pumped to Danbury.   </content>
