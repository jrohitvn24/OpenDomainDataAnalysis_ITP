{  The Morris Markowe Unit}is in New   
 Malden on the south side of Kingston  
 Road. It is also called New Malden    
 Annexe. The hospital caters for 161   
 psycho-geriatric patients. The        
 building was built in Victorian times 
 and could have been a work house. The 
 hospital was named after the last     
 Superintendent. The oldest patient is 
 103 years old. Most of the patients   
 are over 40 years of age. The Annexe  
 is not the main hospital,which is     
 Springfield Hospital in Tooting.      
   Patients are allowed to go outside  
 the hospital occasionally,providing   
 they ask permission first. In the     
 garden there are lots of flowers and  
 trees. Each patient has their own     
 room.
