		<title>18HALLATON: TORCH HOUSE 2</title>
		<content>  Much of the printing, taping, collat-
 ing and library work takes place in   
 the old coach houses and air-raid     
 shelters. Most of the time there are  
 40-50 people living in Torch House and
 the three new houses built in the     
 grounds. About half the staff are vis-
 ually handicapped. Some of the Torch  
 folk are involved with the village    
 chapel and many staff and helpers,    
 blind and sighted, are well known to  
 villagers as they use the village shop
 and travel on the bus. Villagers are  
 invited to Torch for the open day, the
 Easter Sunday Praise Service, and the 
 Christmas Carol Service. Many visit   
 Torch at other times as the doctor    
 holds his surgery there twice a week. 
 The main surgery is at Kibworth, 8    
 miles away, so this local surgery is  
 much appreciated. Mothers and babies  
 meet the health visitor there also.   </content>
