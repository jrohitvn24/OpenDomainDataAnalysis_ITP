		<title>03The Lancaster Canal</title>
		<content>The Lancaster Canal runs through       
Slyne-with-Hest on its way North going 
to Carnforth.It is no longer used for  
industrial traffic but for pleasure    
craft.The Lancaster Canal is a very    
quiet place with many creatures living 
in and around it.Usually tourists go   
boating in their barges in Summer.     
During the Spring ducks and swans have 
ducklings and cygnets, and children    
come from many places to feed them.It  
is a truly relaxing walk to stroll     
along its banks.In the Lancaster Canal 
there are lots of different fish like  
Pike, Roach and many eels, so it is a  
very good spot for fishing.Also        
birdwatchers come and study the        
different species of water bird. Not   
only do fish and birds survive in the  
waters but lots of kinds of weed like  
Canadian and Duckweed which are fairly 
common in the canal.                   </content>
