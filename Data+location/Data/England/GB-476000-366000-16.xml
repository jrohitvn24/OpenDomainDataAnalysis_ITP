		<title>16Scarthingmoor House Farm</title>
		<content>   This property was originally a      
{coaching inn,}where{Queen Victoria}is 
 said to have once stayed, when it was 
 known as the Black Lion. Remnants of  
 its former use remain, such as the    
 bells for summoning servants, and a   
 weather vane in the shape of a lion.  
   The family now running the farm keep
{livestock,}including cattle, sheep,   
 pigs, goats, and especially large     
 numbers of fowl, mostly bred for sale 
 at market. Large incubators have been 
 installed inside the house to hatch   
 the chicks and ducklings.             
   In the typical farmhouse kitchen,   
 there is a large wall clock which has 
 only 58 minutes marked out on its     
 face.
