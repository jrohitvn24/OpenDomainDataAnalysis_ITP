		<content>    Dungeons and dragons is a game for 
 two to about 12 players. You start by 
 rolling three 6 sided dice and you add
 them all together and this is your    
{character strength.}Then you roll the 
 dice another 5 times for your         
 character's intelligence, wisdom,     
 dexterity, constitution and charisma. 
 Then you choose your character's      
 profession such as a cleric, a fighter
 a magician or a thief. A thief is bred
 in the art of picking pockets and     
 locks. A cleric needs wisdom and      
 a fighter needs strength to fight     
 with a heavy sword. A magician        
 needs intelligence to read rules      
 and spells. A thief needs good        
 dexterity to move silently.Next you   
 must choose what race he is going to  
 be; Dwarfs, Elves, Gnomes, Half-Elves,
 Hobbits or Humans.
