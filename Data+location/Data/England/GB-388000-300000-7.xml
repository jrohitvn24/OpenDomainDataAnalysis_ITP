In the 1800s  the site was  owned  by a
banker, Mr Hordern, and his family.They
lived at Dunstall Hall which had lovely
gardens. Unfortunately the gigantic and
beautiful palace-like mansion was  then
demolished,only to build a factory that
made synthetic yarns. In 1972 Courtalds
closed down, the factory was demolished
and  the  site  became  a  wasteground.
Courtaulds tried to sell the  land  but
no-one wanted it. Tarmac Homes enquired
but the answer was no. Eventually  they
got planning permission and Heath Croft
was built.
