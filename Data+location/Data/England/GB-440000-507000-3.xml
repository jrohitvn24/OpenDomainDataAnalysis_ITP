		<title>03KIRKLEVINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The original Domesday Book shows Kirk-
 levington among the crown lands as a  
 "Manor in Lentune". Today it is a     
 busy commuter village.It is  popular  
 for housing built in a rural          
 setting within reach of Middlesbrough,
 Stockton, Darlington &amp; Industrial     
 Teesside. There are{412}houses now    
 compared with 28 in 1947. There are   
{815}people over 18 years &amp; approx.    
{220}children living in the village.   
 Fifty years ago every field was named,
 but now the roads built on them are   
 named thus: Forest Lane, St. Martins  
 Way. The Village Hall, Church, School 
 and "Crown" Pub are meeting places for
 villagers. Mr. Fairs owns the village 
 shop, but for facilities other than   
 post &amp; telephone, people travel to    
 Yarm &amp; beyond. The United Bus stops at
 Forest Lane end on the A67 but most   
 people have their own transport.      </content>
