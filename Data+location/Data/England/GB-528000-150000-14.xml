		<title>14REDHILL TOWN (2)</title>
		<content> In the 1980's the face of REDHILL is  
 changing dramatically.  Redhill used  
 to be a Victorian Railway Town but is 
 now changing into a modern office     
 complex which is trying to attract    
 people out of London.  Other things   
 are changing too, the old Football    
 Stadium was pulled down earlier this  
 year and the football ground is being 
 turned into a park.                   
                                       
 The railway station is still very     
 important to the town.  It provides   
 one of the main links to London and is
 used everyday by thousands of people, 
 businessman, tourists and locals      
 alike.  There are trains to{VICTORIA} 
 and{LONDON BRIDGE}every twenty        
 minutes.  The station is near the town
 centre and is just a few minutes walk 
 from several local schools so is often
 used by shoppers and schoolchildren.  </content>
