		<title>15HESSLE ROAD HULL</title>
		<content> This road was once famous as the      
 centre of the fishing trade but as    
 that industry has gone into decline so
 has the area.  During the war this    
 part of town suffered a great deal due
 to it being very close to the docks,  
 however it was not until 1956 that the
 first slums were cleared.  That street
 was Marmaduke St and it was not       
 re-developed until 1976.  During the  
 clearance work people from the area   
 have been moved to estates such as    
 Orchard Park and Bransholme, but many 
 have been re-housed in the area as    
 3,600 new homes have been built to    
 replace the ones torn down.           
 Not only houses have been built though
 as new schools and industry have also 
 been set up.  The South Orbital road  
 has been built to carry traffic to the
 docks. The area once dominated by     
 fishing now has a new character.      </content>
