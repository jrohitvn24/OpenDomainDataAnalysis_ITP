		<content> Mr Leckenby,who lives at Seave Green  
 Farm has 20 cows now but he did have  
 24.His cows live on 48 acres and he   
 works 12 hours every day.Mrs Leckenby 
 or Mr Flintoft milks for him when he  
 is ill.His cows eat barley,hay,kale   
 and grass which Mr Leckenby grows.Each
 cow gives about 5-6 gallons of milk a 
 day and the collection tanker calls at
 12.00 midday.The most common ailment  
 is Mastitis and most of his calves are
 born without him being there.When he  
 goes to Mart he goes to Northallerton 
 about twice a year.Milking in the     
 winter is difficult and Mr Leckenby   
 has thought of arable farming.He has  
 had 10 calves this year and keeps his 
 milk cows about 12 years and a cow is 
 three years old when it has a calf and
 gives milk.He keeps a dog to help him 
 with his work.
