		<title>05DRURIDGE BAY MIDDLE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Druridge Bay Middle School is 22     
 years old.While the present school was
 being built the children went to a    
 school at Red Row.At that time the    
 present building was a high school.   
 Later an extra block was added beside 
 the main building.This is now used as 
 a teaching block for first year       
 children, and it also houses the      
 public library.In the block there are 
 4 classrooms and in the main building 
 there are 15 classrooms and a gym.The 
 classrooms have changed from the      
 school at Red Row as the windows were 
 higher up and at our school they are  
 lower down.                           
      An english room was a music      
 room.We know this because of the stave
 lines on the blackboard.              
      In the first year the teachers   
 are:Miss Stanton,Mrs.Hawgood and      
 Mrs.Dunn.                             </content>
