		<title>08LIVING IN GROBY.</title>
		<content>    In Groby life is like any other    
 village near a town.It has quite a lot
 of fairs and fetes,especially on      
 Saturdays and Sundays in the summer.  
 There are flourishing organisations   
 like the Guides,Scouts,Cubs and       
 Brownies.These meet either in the     
 Scout Headquarters or in one of the   
 Primary Schools.                      
    Most people go out of Groby to work
 although some work at the local       
 Industrial Estate.                    
    On weekdays there is a 'rush hour' 
 on Ratby Road between 8am and 9am,also
 between 5pm and 6pm.                  
    Life in Groby is great because it  
 isn't too busy either.The only        
 criticisms are that the village could 
 be better policed and the quality of  
 the road surfaces could be improved.
