		<title>13TILE HILL RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> The railway line which runs through   
 Tile Hill was opened on September 17th
 1838. Twelve freight trains use this  
 line every day. The London Express    
 travels along this line but does not  
 stop at this station. Sixty six local 
 trains stop here every day between    
 06.26 and 23.49 hours and about 170   
 passengers use this station (only one 
 first class passenger in ten years)   
 mainly travelling to Birmingham. The  
 signalling for the crossing is worked 
 from Coventry and there are two       
 cameras surveying the track to check  
 it is clear. Tile Hill Station has two
 staff who work in shifts, either 6.10 
 until 14.30, or 14.20 until midnight  
 every day. The tickets they issue have
 a different colour strip down the side
 for different days.
