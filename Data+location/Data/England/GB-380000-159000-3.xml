  Most of the people who live in       
 Bradford-on-Avon do not actually work 
 in the town, but those who do work in 
 the town mainly work for, "Avon       
 Rubber," the ping-pong/tennis ball    
 factory, "Moulton Developments"       
 (where a new type of bicycle was      
 invented) and the printing            
 works. "Avon Rubber," concentrate on  
 making hoses and suspensions for the  
 motor car industry. They also make    
 millions of small rubber diaphragms   
 which are put inside every aerosol can
 made in Europe. Most of the shops in  
 Bradford are self owned and only two  
 stores belong to a national chain of  
 stores, "CO-OP," and "Spar." There is 
 a high proportion of antique shops and
 estate agents.
