		<title>12Whitworth Rush Cart :2</title>
		<content>   Eventually the rushes were not      
 needed in the church but the tradition
 lived on because it had become a      
 holiday. In the early 1900's the      
 ceremony died out because people had  
 proper holidays and more money.       
 Perhaps the churches were also less   
 draughty!                             
   In 1976 the Whitworth Rush Cart     
 Procession was revived. A rush cart   
 dance was remembered by people who    
 were young enough to recall the year  
 of 1920 when celebrations and dances  
 were held to commemorate the newly    
 erected War Memorial.                 
   In 1977, the Queen's Silver Jubilee 
 Year, a charter was found that enabled
 a fair to be held in Whitworth each   
 September and the Whitworth Fair has  
 taken place every year since that     
 date.
