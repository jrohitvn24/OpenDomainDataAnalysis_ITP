		<title>01Maltby and District</title>
		<content> The Maltby district is a gentle dip   
 slope of Magnesian limestone,forming  
 part of the concealed coalfield of    
 South Yorkshire. The coal measures are
 deep down and hidden by the newer     
 cover of limestone. Whilst the exposed
 coalfield further west became         
 industrialised our area remained rural
 and agricultural. Up to 1910 the area 
 contained one village,one hamlet and a
 few scattered farms. The coming of a  
 branch railway and the sinking of the 
 colliery in the early 20th century    
 signalled the transformation of the   
 area. The development of a major      
 colliery has had a profound impact    
 upon employment and the               
 environment,and created multiplier    
 effects for secondary and tertiary    
 industries so that Maltby is an       
 expanding small town with a variety of
 functions.                            </content>
