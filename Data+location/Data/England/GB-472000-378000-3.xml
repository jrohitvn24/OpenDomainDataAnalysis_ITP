		<title>03ST.HELEN'S CHURCH,GROVE.</title>
		<content> The Parish of Grove has not had a     
 resident vicar for 32 years,when      
 Rev.Padgell died.In the meantime,     
 Services have gradually been          
 curtailled.This summer they were      
 reduced to two a month, one being Holy
 Communion.The bells are now rung only 
 on special occasions. The congregation
 now averages only eight and there is  
 only one warden in office.Weeds are   
 now growing from the top of the tower 
 and the church is falling into a state
 of disrepair. The rectory is now used 
 as a private dwelling and its former  
 stables,now housing the Village Hall, 
 urgently need repair and decoration.  
 The church is reached by a grass path 
 from a Lych Gate and passing through  
 the churchyard.The oldest marked grave
 is dated 1766.  Visitors are now on   
 the increase and include many from the
 U.S.A.                                </content>
