		<content> This area is sparsely populated with  
 no definite village centre. Most      
 houses are of traditional farm style  
 recently renovated, possibly by       
 newcomers. One or two large new houses
 were observed. Buildings are of red   
 brick; some with wood frames; many    
 with local sandstone bases. Some      
 former farms are now used as transport
 depots or as builders yards etc.      
 The terrain is extensively cultivated 
 with fields of mixed cereals. Smaller 
 areas nearer to the farm houses are   
 put down to soft fruit and vegetables,
 some advertising to the public as     
 "Pick Your Own".                      
                                       
 The view from high points revealed a  
 surprising amount of tree cover in    
 hedgerows and small copses. The       
 hedgerows are of various trees. The   
 copses are about an acre in size.     </content>
