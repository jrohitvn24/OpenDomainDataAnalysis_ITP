		<title>09Hanger Down,Cornwood</title>
		<content> When the Blachford estate recently    
 came on the market it was feared that 
 Hanger Down might be sold off         
 independantly to the Dinnaton country 
 club owners,who wanted it for an      
 18-hole golf-course.The Down is unique
 in that it is separated from Dartmoor 
 proper,while retaining all the featur-
 es of open moorland.A petition,bearing
 1000 signatures,was devised locally,  
 requesting the refusal of the golf    
 course application,and the retaining  
 of the Down in its present condition, 
 which allows the public to enjoy its  
 footpaths and bridlepath.Friends of   
 the Earth,the R.S.P.B.,the Dartmoor   
 Preservation Society,and others joined
 in the protest,resulting in a restric-
 tion being placed on the Down requir- 
 ing any future owner to apply to the  
 National Park committee before alter- 
 ing the Down's  purpose in anyway.    </content>
