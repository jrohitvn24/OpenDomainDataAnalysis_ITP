             APPLEY                    
       Appley consists of a small      
 number of houses and farms. At the    
 centre of Appley is the Globe, a pub  
 which can be quite busy, especially   
 after a cricket match has been played 
 or when skittles are in progress.     
       A house that is now lived in    
 used to be the local Primary School.  
 Like most of the buildings in the     
 area, it is of considerable age and is
 constructed of slate from a nearby    
 quarry. Modern buildings of the       
 present school are hidden from view.  
       At Appley Court Farm they have  
 recently sold all their herd of cows. 
 Nearby is Frogs Farmhouse which is    
 quite ancient and has a pretty        
 thatched roof.
