		<content>    The{River Trent}runs through this  
 area separating the{Meadows}to the    
 north of the river, from the village  
 of{Wilford}and the town of{West       
{Bridgford}to the south.Three bridges  
 take traffic across the river.        
    In the{Meadows,}which is part of   
 the city of{Nottingham,}many of the   
 Victorian houses have been demolished 
 and new houses built instead. There is
 an industrial estate too.             
   {Wilford}is a growing village       
 community with small areas of new     
 houses.Leisure organisations flourish,
 which gives the village a lively      
 social network.                       
   {West Bridgford}has grown over the  
 last hundred years from a small       
 village to a thriving,busy town of    
 about 27,000 inhabitants. Within the  
 town is County Hall and the{Rushcliffe
{Civic Centre.}                        </content>
