		<title>01Eastern End of Alderney C I</title>
		<content> The eastern end of Alderney is low    
 lying and fringed by sandyy beaches.  
 There is evidence of pre-historic     
 remains and it is also supposed that  
 the area was used as a burial site by 
 people from France 8 miles across the 
 race.                                 
 The Romans probably used Longis Bay   
 as a staging post.                    
 There are numerous forts spanning     
 years from 1548 Essex Castle, through 
 the Victorian forsts of 1850's to the 
 German structures of World War II.    
 This area is sparsely inhabited with  
 little cultivation but boasts         
 Alderney's finest beaches,golf course 
 and lighthouse.
