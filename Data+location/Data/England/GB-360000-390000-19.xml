		<title>19RECREATION_SATURDAY CLUB</title>
		<content> The Saturday Club starts at 10.30am   
 and it finishes at 12 noon and I go   
 every Saturday.If it is just a club   
 session it costs 25p but if it        
 something special like a film or a    
 show, it costs 40p. When you join you 
 get a membership card with a number on
 it and every week someone picks a     
 number out of the bag. If it is your  
 number you get some prizes like cars  
 or posters or games. At the Saturday  
 Club you can stay inside and make     
 things like masks or sewing, or you   
 can go in the sports hall to play     
 games like rounders, basketball or    
 tennis.During the school holidays     
 Saturday Club is usually on every day 
 of the week but not Saturday or       
 Sunday.
