 and I have cornflakes for breakfast at
 07.15. Then I feed my two rabbits and 
 guinea_pigs. At 07.45. I walk down the
 lane to the bus-stop. The bus comes at
 08.20. School starts at 08.45.Assembly
 is at about 09.15. Then at 10.30 it is
 playtime. At 12.00 we have lunch.     
 Afterwards we have another playtime.  
 School finishes at 15.00 and then we  
 get on the bus again. I get home at

 Afterwards I pick some grass for the  
 rabbits and guinea-pigs and then I    
 play on the computer or watch the     
 television.I have my dinner at 17.00
