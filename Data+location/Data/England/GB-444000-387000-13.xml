		<title>13FAMILY CHURCH SERVICE</title>
		<content>   {                                   
  Once a month a family service is held
 at Ulley Church.This service is taken 
 by a retired curate.We were greeted by
 Mrs Lovely the local farmers wife,who 
 is also the Sunday School teacher.She 
 gave us an hymn and prayer book and we
 sat in the middle of the church.The   
 service began with a hymn and was     
 accompanied by the organist.The       
 service was very pleasant and the     
 theme was about Love and all that love
 means and entails.The sermon was      
 interesting and the hour and twenty   
 minutes that we spent in the church   
 passed very quickly.The service ended 
 with Holy Communion which most of the 
 adults took part in by going up to the
 altar to take the bread and wine.We   
 children also went up to the altar for
 a blessing.After the service we were  
 invited for refreshments.             </content>
