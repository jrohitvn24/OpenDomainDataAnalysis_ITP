		<title>18HUNTING AROUND MAREFIELD</title>
		<content> This ares is one of the premier fox   
 hunting districts of England, the     
 territories of the Quorn and          
 Cottesmore Hunts meeting here. The    
 John O'Gaunt Fox Covert is maintained 
 by the Quorn Hunt as a refuge and     
 breeding place for foxes. The Quorn   
 hunts in this area on Fridays hence   
 the area is known as "Friday Country" 
 Most farmers give permission for the  
 hunt to cross their land and the hunt 
 notifies the farmer when it is likely 
 to do so. Hunting begins in late      
 October and continues until March with
 cubhunting in the preceding two       
 months. The traditional hunting dress 
 is only worn in the main season, with 
 tweeds being worn for cubbing. The    
 packs of foxhounds are maintained by  
 the Master of the Hunt, although today
 this expense is often shared by Joint 
 Masters and Committees.               </content>
