		<title>03PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> In the school yard we play all types  
 of games. The boys play football most 
 of the time but will occasionially    
 play 'bull dog' or 'cat &amp; mouse'.     
 Girls do join in with the boys in cat 
 &amp; mouse which is similar to bull dog. 
 One person has to try to catch or     
 touch people as they run from one end 
 of the yard to the other.             
  The girls also play skipping games   
 with rhymes,and 'two balls' against   
 the wall. Some of the games involve   
 just singing &amp; doing actions. One of  
 the songs we sing is called "My name  
 is Diana Dors". Here are the words.   
{MY NAME IS DIANA DORS,                
{AND I'M A MOVIE  STAR                 
{I'VE GOT A CUTE, CUTE FACE,           
{I PLAY A MONKEY GUITAR,               
{I'VE GOT THE LIPS OOH,                
{I'VE GOT THE  HIPS OOH,
