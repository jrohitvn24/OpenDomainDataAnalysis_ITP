 Ashling now have no immediate shops   
 whilst Fishbourne has only one.The    
 only{Post Office}is at Bosham.        
  Bakery,butcher,sweet and general     
 store shops have all{closed in recent}
{years. }                              
  A large{Hypermarket at Havant}and    
 numerous{supermarkets at Chichester } 
 have taken their toll.Shopping habits 
 have changed.Families travel by car or
