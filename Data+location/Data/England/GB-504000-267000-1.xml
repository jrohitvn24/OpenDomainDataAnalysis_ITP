		<content> Dean is Bedfordshire's most northerly 
 village and one of the most           
 attractive. The Parish stretches from 
 the Melchbourne boundary to the Three 
 Shires Stone on the A45, marking the  
 junction of Bedfordshire,             
 Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire:  
 the original stone was the base of an 
 old stone cross. Dean straddles a     
 small tributary of the River Till:    
 there is a ford across Shay Lane. The 
 village is in 2 parts Upper and Lower 
 Dean which are separated by about 0.5 
 mile of winding lanes. Overlooking the
 villages from Shelton Hill is a       
 windmill, now a derelict tower mill   
 with some of it's machinery and sails 
 still in place. It is the last of such
 mills in North Bedfordshire and would 
 be well worth saving.                 
 From the road between Upper and Lower 
 Dean a wide Green Lane leads to walks.</content>
