		<content> Built circa 1740 as a home farm of    
 Appuldurcombe Estate, it was          
 remodelled about 1840 and extended to 
 become a gentleman's residence. Built 
 of local stone, with Georgian sash    
 windows, the original roof has hand   
 made clay peg tiles. About 1900 a     
 servants' wing was added, the later   
 addition having a welsh slate roof, 10
 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, lounge, dining 
 room, study, billiard room, kitchen   
 and servants' hall. The 4-acre grounds
 contained fish ponds, fountains,      
 walled garden, orchard, stables,      
 keenels and coach house. Pre-1939 it  
 was a guest house,then successively an
 emergency army hostel and a hostel for
 Italian prisoner of war working on the
 land. Bomb damaged and empty for      
 several years, it is now restored as a
 family home.
