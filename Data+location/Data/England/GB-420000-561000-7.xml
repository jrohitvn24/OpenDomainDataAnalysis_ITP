		<title>07LOCAL EVENTS IN ELSWICK</title>
		<content>  For the{Elswick Festival}they had a  
 bouncy castle, a mini hoppings, grass 
 sledging,scoop the duck,gymnastics and
 a raffle stall.They played "It's a    
 Knockout" and each team made a joker  
 which was held up when they wanted to 
 play a certain game. One game was     
 called{"Hit the Head".}You put seven  
 people into a dinghy and paddled up   
 the pool until you were in a throwing 
 position.When the heads were knocked  
 down you were pulled back and the     
 first team to get back were the       
 winners. In a game called{"Fill the   
{Pot"}you got buckets, some cups and a 
 dinghy. You paddled up the pool and   
 while you were paddling you filled the
 buckets with water by using the cups. 
 The water was then put into a         
 container at the end of the pool,     
 measured and the team with most water 
 won the contest.                      </content>
