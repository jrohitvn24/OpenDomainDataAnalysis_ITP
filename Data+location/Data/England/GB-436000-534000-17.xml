		<content> I GET UP AT 7.30AM ON SCHOOL DAYS AND 
 GET READY AND WASHED.I GET MY GYM GEAR
 READY FOR SCHOOL AND THEN I GET NMY   
 COAT ON AND 30p FOR SCHOOL.WHEN I GET 
 TO THE BUS STOP I CATCH THE BUS TO    
 SCHOOL IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO 
 GET TO SCHOOL.WHEN WE GOT TO SCHOOL WE
 HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE BEFORE WE GO INTO
 SCHOOL.THE SCHOOL IS BIG IT HAS A HALL
 AND CLASSROOMS.THE BELL GOES AFTER WE 
 HAVE A LITTLE PLAY.WE LINE UP IN OUR  
 LINES AND GO IN.WE DO SOME WORK AND   
 THEN HAVE TEN MINUTES PLAYTIME.THE    
 THING WHAT I LIKE ABOUT SCHOOL IS P.E.
 WE HAVE IT THREE TIMES A WEEK.THE BELL
 GOES AT 12.00 FOR DINNER SOME PEOPLE  
 GO FIRST AND SOME PEOPLE GO SECOND FOR
 THEIR DINNERS.THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE     
 PACKED LUNCH GO AND AFTER THAT WE HAVE
 ANOTHER PLAYTIME THEN A STORY AND GO  
 HOME.
