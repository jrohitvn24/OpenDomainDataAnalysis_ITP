		<title>04Attitudes Newton/Dunham area</title>
		<content> Attitudes vary with a persons         
 age.People of middle age and over have
 usually lived in the area all their   
 lives and have relatives and friends  
 in the area. They do not leave the    
 village much and regret the lack of   
 public transport and central points of
 old village life - doctor butcher     
 baker.  They feel life is not as good 
 as it was. New people to the area have
 usually chosen to live here and       
 purchased houses. They tend to be     
 young, most have children and have    
 created facilities for them such as   
 playgroups toddlers clubs and youth   
 clubs. Children attend the village    
 schools happily and play outdoors     
 after school when the weather permits.
 They are more unsophisticated than    
 children from   the towns.
