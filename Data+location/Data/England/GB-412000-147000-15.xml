		<title>15FIGHELDEAN IN 54 YEARS.</title>
		<content>  The school caretaker,{Mrs Lewis,     
 moved to{Figheldean}as a child.       
  In those days,{1930,}there was no    
 mains water, no main sewage disposal  
 and{no electricity.}Today the         
 villagers have the benefit of all     
 these amenities and also pedestrian   
 street lights for the dark winter     
 nights.                               
{ There is a general store with a post 
{office counter but there used to be   
{four shops}including a{blacksmith, a  
{baker, a grocer and a separate post   
{office. There is also a public house  
{and a Working Men's Club.}The Club is 
 new.                                  
  Some of the houses, several with     
 thatched roofs, are very old and have 
 changed little but there has been a   
 lot of new dwellings on the eastern   
 side,most of them bungalows.
