		<content>  This 'D' block covers a rural area on
 the south-west escarpment of the      
 Cotswolds. Within the area are the    
 villages of Hillesley, Alderley and   
 Tresham, and the hamlets of Lower     
 Kilcott and Wortley. Alderley and     
 Wortley are within the county of      
 Gloucestershire. The other villages   
 were also in that county until the    
 government county boundary            
 re-organisation in 1974, since when   
 Hillesley, Tresham and Lower Kilcott  
 have been situated within the newly   
 formed county of Avon.                
  Hillesley covers the largest of the  
 residential areas within the block,   
 and also has the greatest population. 
 Most of the area is covered by        
 farmland, some of which has been      
 planted with crops, but most is rough 
 grazing land. The woodland areas are  
 dominantly deciduous trees.           </content>
