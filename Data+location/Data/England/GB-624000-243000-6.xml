		<title>06MARTLESHAM NEW VILLAGE.</title>
		<content>The village has been developed over the
last fifteen years on the site of the  
former Martlesham Heath airfield by the
Bradford Property Trust. Mainly heath- 
lands the site lies just South of the  
A12 and about l mile west of the       
original village of Martlesham.        
A tremendous variety of houses ranging 
from large detached to smaller terraced
accomodation in many different styles  
and colours have been erected to meet  
the demands of an incoming population. 
At the centre of the village lies a    
square of shops, a bank and other      
services and also the Douglas Bader    
public house-opened by the man himself.
Nearby is the Community Centre and a   
large green.                           
The former role of the site is         
preserved in some of the road names    
like Gloster, Anson, Hawker and        
Lancaster.                             </content>
