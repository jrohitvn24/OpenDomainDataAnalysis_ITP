		<title>15Press and Radio in Dunmow</title>
		<content>   Most people in the area receive a   
 national newspaper daily. The local   
 area does publish a few weekly        
 periodicals. The Dunmow and Braintree 
 Times and the Dunmow Observer are     
 rival papers covering local news,     
 sports and events. Many people also   
 receive free papers covering motoring 
 and real estate.  These contain little
 real news, mainly advertisements which
 pay for their publication.            
   All these papers are delivered by   
 paper boys and girls around the area. 
   The area benefits due to location in
 that it can receive both Essex Radio  
 and some London stations.  The most   
 popular station is Radio One though it
 is being challenged by off-shore      
 pirate radio stations.                
  However television is the clear      
 leader in the distribution of views,  
 news and entertainment.               </content>
