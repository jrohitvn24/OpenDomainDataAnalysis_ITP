		<title>19RAMSGATE HARBOUR</title>
		<content>Ramsgate's harbour was built 200 years 
ago and is now changing dramatically.  
Once the home of a large fishing fleet,
port of call for pleasure steamers from
London and home of the first hovercraft
service,it now is a yacht marina and a 
landing stage for imported foreign cars
Adjoining the harbour,a large complex  
called Port Sally has been built to    
accommodate the Sally Line passenger   
and car ferries,and Schiaffino lorry   
ferries.Beyond the harbour,a long outer
arm is being built to give a large area
of still water;more jetties will be    
made;new roads will run along the shore
to carry the large container lorries.  
Managing the harbour are Captains Phinn
and Grieves who are in charge of all   
shipping traffic in and around the     
Sally complex and harbour.Trinity House
pilot boats,Ramsgate's lifeboats and   
dredgers all work from the harbour.    </content>
