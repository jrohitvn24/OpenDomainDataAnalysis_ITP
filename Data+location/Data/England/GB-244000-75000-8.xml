		<title>08WHEN MY GRAN WAS YOUNG.</title>
		<content> When I went to interview my Gran,Mrs  
 E.Worth she said she prefers in the   
 middle of her life than today because 
 she was more able to do things.She    
 said our school was the same as today,
 but everyone left at the age of 14,   
 except the farmers' sons who left at  
 the age of 11 and went to Grammar     
 school at Tavistock.The transport you 
 would have had was a bus, but today   
  people without cars suffer because   
 the bus only goes through Lamerton    
 twice a week.They used to play with   
 dolls,skipping ropes and wooden hoops,
 and they would have played marbles,   
 snap dominoes snakes and ladders,ludo,
 rounders and hop scotch.Gran said     
 there used to be a wall dividing girls
 from boys and my mum Mrs.M.Worth said 
 that it was still there when she went 
 to school.Today boys and girls play   
 together.                             </content>
