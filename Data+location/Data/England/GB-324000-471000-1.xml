		<title>01TOPOGRAPHY/GAZETTEER OF AREA</title>
		<content> The topography of the area is a com-  
 bination of soft rolling hills and    
 flat land. The fields, mainly under   
 grass,are enclosed by hedges and walls
 constructed of the bed rock,which is  
 limestone, as are most of the build-  
 ings in the three villages of the area
 listed in the following gazetteer.    
 In STAINTON WITH ADGARLEY the farms   
 and cottages are built around a large 
 green,where a cock fighting ring is   
 still visible. There are two public   
 houses and a limestone quarry.        
 In LITTLE URSWICK the ancient Grammar 
 School and the Inn border the village 
 green along with the  farms and cott- 
 ages. There is a garage with work shop
 and petrol pumps.                     
 SCALES is a quiet linear village of   
 cottages and farms. It has a small    
 school and a malt kiln in the centre, 
 and a ruined castle on the outskirts. </content>
