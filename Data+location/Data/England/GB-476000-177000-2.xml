		<content> We interviewed a{farmer}who owns 320  
 acres, a{tenant farmer,}a{herdsman}&amp; a
{smallholder.}The tenant farmer employs
 6 men,including a tractor driver and 4
 herdsmen, on his medium sized,600 acre
 farm. One farmer keeps 67 cows and the
 other has 600. The herdsman we met is 
 responsible for 108 cows and the milk 
 yield is 8500 litres per week. All the
 workers are skilled and attend courses
 with the Agricultural Training        
 Board.Both farmers have students from 
 the Berkshire College of Agriculture  
 to learn on their farms. Both farmers 
 agreed the 1984 harvest was the best  
 they had known. They produce grass for
 silage, forage, maize, barley &amp; spring
 corn. They own tractors, harrows,     
 drills, milking machines, and machines
 which do several jobs.                
 The smallholder grows vegetables and  
 fruit for local customers.            </content>
