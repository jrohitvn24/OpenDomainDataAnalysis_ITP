 Working down a coal mine in the old   
 days was not much fun.It's hard to get
 up early when you are little.Boys,men 
 and women worked down the mine.The    
 ones who opened the doors were only 5 
 or 6 years old.The miners told them   
 stories about ghosts and they got     
 scared and lonely.It was very dark but
 if you lit a match it would blow up   
 because of the gas.There were brackets
 to keep up the roof.Boys pulled trucks
 but if you didn't work hard your Dad  
 spanked you because he got less money.</content>
