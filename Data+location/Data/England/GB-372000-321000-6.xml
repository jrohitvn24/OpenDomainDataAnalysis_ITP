		<content> WALLS AS IT PASSES THROUGH THE        
 CHETWYND ESTATE.                      
   THE MAIN KIND OF BOUNDARY ALONG THE 
 MANY LANES IN THE AREA WAS HEDGING .  
 THE FIRST HEDGEROW WE STUDIED WAS NEAR
 THE VILLAGE OF FORTON NEXT TO FARMLAND
 (03750321). WE MEASURED TEN PACES     
 ALONG A SECTION OF HEDGEROW AND       
 NOTED DOWN THE PLANTS AND ANY ANIMAL  
 LIFE. THE HEDGE WAS ON A BANK ABOVE A 
 DITCH. THE MAIN SHRUB OF THE HEDGE WAS
 HAWTHORN WITH SOME HOLLY, FIELD MAPLE 
 AND HONEYSUCKLE. WE FOUND THE CHICKS  
 OF GUINEA FOWL RUNNING ALONG THE HEDGE
 AS WELL AS A BLACKBIRDS NEST. ON THE  
 BANK BELOW THE HEDGE WERE BRAMBLES AND
 COMMON CLEAVERS WHICH WE CALL GOOSE   
 GRASS. THIS PLANT IS COVERED IN LITTLE
 HAIRS WHICH MAKE IT CLING TO OUR      
 CLOTHES. OTHER PLANTS ON THE BANK WERE
 GRASSES, NETTLES, HEDGE PARSLEY,WHITE 
 CAMPION, BUTTERCUPS AND SOME DOCK.    </content>
