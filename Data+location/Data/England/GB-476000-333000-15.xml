		<content> When babies are born the mums look    
 after their babies.The babies are     
 usally wrapped in cloth or towels.When
 the mum comes home with her baby the  
 nurse checks in every so often to see 
 how the baby is.The nurse also comes  
 to children at the school and she     
 looks at your hair and finger nails   
 and toes and eyes .When you have got a
 cough you don't have to go to hospital
 but if you have stitches you do.You   
 don't stay in to have stitches but if 
 you break your leg you do have to stay
 in hospital.If you an operation you   
 have to stay in hospital as well.There
