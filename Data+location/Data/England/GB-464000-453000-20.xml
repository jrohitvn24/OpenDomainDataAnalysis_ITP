		<content>        When we looked at the old      
 census lists of 1861 we were surprised
 at the number of peoples surnames that
 were the same as the names of children
 who are at our School now.            
        In the Parish Church of Holy   
 Trinity at Stockton there are many    
 memorials to the Agar family.Charles  
 Agar inherited Stockton Hall in 1910. 
 Records show that a Thomas Agar was a 
 landowner in Stockton in 1583.The Pub 
 at Warthill is known as the Agar Arms.
        Stockton has some roads        
 named after notable historic local    
 characters.There is De Mauley Place   
 named after the Lord of the Manor in  
 1303.Chaumont Way remembers Gaceus de 
 Chaumont who was Lord Mayor of York in
 1256 and was a landowner in Stockton. 
 Finally, there is a road named Marmian
 Drive, which recalls Maud Marmian who 
 owned the land in the village in 1347.</content>
