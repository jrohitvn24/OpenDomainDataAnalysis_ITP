		<content> manage the manor and serve the knights
 and tutors.It is thought that some    
 tutors would have been knights who had
 earlier fought in the Holy Land and   
 returned to England after they had    
 been injured.                         
 Very little of the commandery remains.
 Only the Dove Cote and the Gate House 
 of the original buildings survive     
 intact.The main building,the Court,   
 was deliberately destroyed and the    
 stone used to build farm buildings at 
 a later date.
