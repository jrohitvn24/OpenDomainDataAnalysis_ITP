		<content> This is an area of small family farms 
 in flat countryside which avoids      
 bleakness through its many hedges &amp;   
 trees, a green backcloth for the old  
 farmhouses and farmbuildings. There   
 are many hamlets and groups of houses 
 but the chief residential area is The 
 Street at Smarden, dominated by the   
 stone church tower to the west. This  
 harmonious group of houses, built over
 4 centuries, displays several types of
 local material: brick, tile-hanging,  
 plaster &amp; beam and most prominently,  
 weatherboard. Kentish ragstone was    
 used for the church, school, Old      
 Rectory and one pair of cottages near 
 the church. The local authority has   
 established a conservation area around
 the church, where building is strictly
 controlled and the appearance of the  
 old houses maintained. Only 2 examples
 of thatched houses remain.            </content>
