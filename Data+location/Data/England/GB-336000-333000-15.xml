		<title>15Hardwick Estate</title>
		<content> The estate occupies some 560 acres in 
 a belt between Ellesmere and Frankton.
 Owned by Colonel Kynaston it now      
 comprises three farms,one devoted to  
 arable,one to doing and one to dry    
 stock.There are also estate cottages  
 at Perthy.There are about 40 acres of 
 woodland on the estate, much of it    
 around the hall itself.There is also a
 large pool and several smaller ones.  
   In the current year some 220 acres  
 were devoted to cereal,60 acres to    
 peas(for both animal and human        
 consumption)and the rest is lay grass.
 The estate is worked by a  labour     
 force of 6,one of whom is also        
 responsible for the lawns etc at the  
 Hall.The Hall,much altered in its     
 time ,is still a very fine country    
 house and stands in a position        
 enjoying views across the estate      
 itself.                               </content>
