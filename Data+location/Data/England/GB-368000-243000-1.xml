		<content> The name Bosbury is derived from the  
 Saxon word "Bosanberrig" meaning      
 Bosa's Town. Bosa was a member of the 
 household of Witlaf, King of Mercia   
 around 800.                           
 Bosbury's rural parish occupies 4769  
 acres and has a population of around  
 800.                                  
 The village centre is comprised       
 largely of half-timbered houses, some 
 of which date back to medieval times. 
 The surrounding district is almost    
 entirely farmland. The majority of    
 farms in this area are small,         
 approximately 100 acres,with mixed    
 farming,ie.wheat,dairy cattle,sheep   
 and fruit. Hops are grown at several  
 farm. Most of the population          
 work on the land or commute to the    
 neighbouring towns of Malvern, Ledbury
 or Bromyard.
