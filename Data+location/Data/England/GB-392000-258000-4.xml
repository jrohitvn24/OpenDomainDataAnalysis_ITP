		<content>       The other forms of intensive    
 enterprises are Dairying and Beef     
 production. The Dairy herds consist   
 mainly of Freision cows - these being 
 used because of their ability to give 
 greater yealds of milk. With the      
 advent of better breeding schemes the 
 quality of the milk in terms of butter
 fat content and solids not fat has    
 risen , as also has the general       
 conformation and standard of the      
 cattle.                               
      Most of the intensive beef       
 animals are a by-product of the dairy 
 herd i.e. all the bull calves , whilst
 the heffers are generally used to     
 replace their dames in the dairy herd.
 The beef units are generally producing
 an animal ready for slaughter at 11   
 months of age having been fed on      
 barley and straw.
