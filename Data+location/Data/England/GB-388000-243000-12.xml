		<content>{ Defford}is a peaceful village with a 
 great variety of housing. the ages    
 vary considerably. Most of the homes  
 are post{1945.}There are a few 19th   
 century  and fewer still before that  
 date. Some of the later 20th century  
 are faked to look like 18th century   
 houses. Many of the homes in the      
 village are owned by the local        
 council. Despite their age the        
 pre-twentieth century houses appear to
 be in better condition than the later 
 buildings.
