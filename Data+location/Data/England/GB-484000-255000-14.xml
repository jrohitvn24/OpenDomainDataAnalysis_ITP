		<title>14 Game keepers</title>
		<content>  About fourteen gamekeepers were      
employed on the estate each being in   
charge of approximately 800 acres of   
land and responsible for 50 coops.The  
pheasants eggs were hatched under a    
brooding hen and the chicks when reared
were released on to the estate         
In the quiter   period of the year the 
task of the game keeper was to protect 
the pheasants from vermin such as      
owls,weazels,stoats and foxes.As the   
darker nights approached,so the number 
of poachers increased, then the game   
keepers rounds would become much       
busier .Shooting time for   the        
pheasants began in October.Some of the 
birds taken would be used at Castle    
Ashby house and some were sold in      
Northampton, but most were sent to the 
game dealers  in London .Beaters had   
to be taken on during the pheasant     
shoot                                  </content>
