		<content>      Lower Whitehalgh Farm is 185     
 acres. Mr Shorrock, the farmer, keeps 
 cows and sheep but he doesn't grow any
 crops. He has 100 cows altogether,    
 most of them are Friesian but he also 
 has 3 Charolais bulls. The biggest    
 bull weighs one and a quarter tons. He
 has 41 sheep which are pedigree       
 Suffolk. The cows are milked and the  
 milk is kept cool until a tanker comes
 to collect it. If the milk is not the 
 right temperature, he will not get the
 proper price for it.                  
      Horden Farm covers 70 acres and  
 is a mixed farm, keeping sheep and    
 growing crops.                        
      Higher Whitehalgh Farm covers 100
 acres and is similar to Lower         
 Whitehalgh Farm in that it keeps dairy
 cattle and sheep.
