 GROUPS OF LILLY PADS,A DUCK ISLAND AND
 TWO DUCK HOUSES,ALL OF WHICH ARE BEING
 USED BY MOORHENS AND DUCKS. THE       
 REMAINDER OF THE GREEN IS OCCUPIED BY 
 GRASS AND TREES AND IS LOOKED AFTER   
 VERY WELL.                            
                                       
 THERE ARE TWO PUBLIC HOUSES IN THE    
 AREA. ONE BY THE VILLAGE GREEN WHICH  
 IS RUN BY A MAN NAMED MARTIN          
 PATCHING. THIS HOUSE IS NAMED 'THE RED
 LION'. MARTIN WAS ONCE A PLAYER IN    
 WATFORD FOOTBALL TEAM. 'THE RED LION' 
 HAS A NICE GARDEN WITH NICE FLOWERS.  
 ONCE EVERY YEAR 'THE RED LION' HOLDS A
 BAR-B-QUE IN THE GARDEN.              
                                       
 THE SECOND PUBLIC HOUSE IS CALLED 'THE
 PLOUGH' AND IS NEAR TO THE VILLAGE
