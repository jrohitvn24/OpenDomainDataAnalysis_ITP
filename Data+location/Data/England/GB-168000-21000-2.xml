		<content> This is a very rural area where very  
 few people live.There are only three  
 villages,{Garras,Cross Lanes}and{White
{Cross}all of which are quite small.   
 There is also a hamlet called         
{Nantithet.}There are many{scattered}  
 houses and many{isololated farms.  }  
                                       
 Most of the land is farm land with    
 farm houses which are at least 100    
 years old and are made from local     
 stone.This stone has been obtained    
 from{local quarries. }                
 One third of the houses are made from 
 bricks or concrete blocks and have    
 been built in the last 50 years.      
                                       
 The houses that have been built most  
 recentiy  have been faced in{local}   
{stone}to make them{blend}in with the  
{countryside.}
