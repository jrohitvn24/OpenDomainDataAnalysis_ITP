		<title>15HOUSING. General Description</title>
		<content>  Most housing is in and around BROCTON
village though there are a few isolated
cottages for farm/forestry workers.    
The village is based around half a     
dozen old buildings in the centre      
built in previous centuries and        
a few farm buildings.To the SE along   
Sawpit Lane are some mid 20th Century  
semi detached and bungalow housing.To  
the north there exists much of the     
newer houses many built since          
1970.There are no estates with much of 
the building being small, individually 
designed and expensive houses in the   
60/90 thousand pound price range.      
{MY HOUSE}.....We have gas central     
heating.Only three of the windows are  
double glazed.We dont have cavity wall 
insulation.We cook by electricity and  
have a lot of electrical appliances.   
Four people live in our house.
