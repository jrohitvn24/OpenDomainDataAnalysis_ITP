		<content> Radio,television and magnetic tape    
 recording aids are used in schools to 
 add interest to lessons. Films are    
 shown and transparent photographs are 
 shown on a screen by means of         
 projectors _ which illustrate points  
 which the teacher wishes to make. Very
 recently, the computer has been       
 introduced to schools and children are
 being taught to operate these new     
 electronic machines both for pleasure 
 (playing games) and for learning. Our 
 belief today is tha the silicon chip  
 which stores information for recall,  
 is going to revolutionise our lives by
 the uses to which it will be put.
