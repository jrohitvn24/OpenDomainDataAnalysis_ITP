		<content>   THE BLOCK IS SERVED MAINLY BY 2     
 GENERAL PRACTICES, BOTH HAVING THEIR  
 SURGERIES OUTSIDE THE BLOCK, IN       
 LISKEARD. THERE ARE HEALTH VISITORS,  
 DISTRICT NURSES AND COMMUNITY MIDWIVES
 ATTACHED TO BOTH PRACTICES.           
   THE NEAREST GENERAL HOSPITAL IS IN  
 PLYMOUTH, BUT THERE IS A COTTAGE      
 HOSPITAL IN LISKEARD, TO WHICH        
 HOSPITAL CONSULTANTS COME TO HOLD     
 CLINICS.                              
  BABIES ARE BORN AT PLYMOUTH OR TRURO 
 HOSPITALS, A DISTANCE OF 22 OR 30     
 MILES. A FEW HOME DELIVERIES ARE      
 CARRIED OUT BUT NOT ENCOURAGED, BY THE
 LOCAL GPs.                            
   THERE ARE NO DENTIST SURGERIES OR   
 OPTICIANS OR OSTEOPATHS IN THE BLOCK. 
 A CHIROPODY CLINIC IS HELD WEEKLY FOR 
 THE ELDERLY IN DOBWALLS.
