   Barnston originally a very small    
 village, is where most of the modern  
 development has taken place in this   
 rural area.  The church is situated   
 outside the main village and dates    
 from Norman times.  The population is 
 now approximately 900.                
                                       
                                       
   The earliest recorded building is   
 the Little Dunmow Priory founded in   
 1104 around which the village grew and
 has remained largely unchanged.  It   
 now has a population of approximately 
 300.
