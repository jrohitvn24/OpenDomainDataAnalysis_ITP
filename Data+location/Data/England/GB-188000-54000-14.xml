		<title>14THE BLOCK WORKS</title>
		<content> A very recent addition to this area is
 the English China Clay Companies block
 works which serves the whole of       
 Cornwall. The works took 12 months to 
 build and was opened in 1984. It is   
 along side Milord's Road which runs   
 from Fraddon to Scarcewater.The works 
 covers 22 acres, 7 of which are       
 tarmacadamed. It produces concrete    
 blocks using the nearby waste China   
 Clay sand brought in by 50 ton        
 dumpers, cement in bulk tankers from  
 the cement depot at Chacewater and    
 mains water. The works are fully      
 antomated requiring only 24 staff. It 
 is basically a programme Logic control
 system which requires a process to be 
 completed before the previous         
 operation in a sequence of events can 
 take place.Another innovation is that 
 blocks are dried in kilns as a result 
 of their own drying process.          </content>
