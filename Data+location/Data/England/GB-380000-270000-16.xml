		<title>16POCKET MONEY</title>
		<content>   81 children were asked if they had  
 pocket money and if so how they used  
 it.                                   
                                       
 75 had pocket money and 6 did not.    
 More fathers than mothers give pocket 
 money.                                
 The average amount is 80p.            
 Lots of children have their pocket    
 money once a week.                    
 More than half save some and spend    
 some while the majority of the rest   
 save everything.                      
 Only 5 spend it all.Those who spent   
 their pocket money mostly bought      
 sweets toys and games.                
                                       
   Children who do not receive pocket  
 money have their needs met directly   
 by their parents.
