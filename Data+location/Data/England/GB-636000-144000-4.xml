		<content>   The Pines Gardens are just over 6   
 acres of land which are to be         
 preserved as open space. They were    
 previously owned by a family who left 
 the Pines house and 3 acres of land   
 derelict and ugly.                    
   Mr.and Mrs.Cleary(founders of the   
 St.Margaret's Bay Trust)had a dream of
 just how the Pines Garden could look. 
   First of all the site had to be     
 purchased and cleared.Then in 1970    
 work was started.In 1971 they were    
 officially opened and in 1972 a large 
 statue,by the sculptor Oscar Nemon,of 
 Sir Winston Churchill was erected in  
 the gardens facing the White Cliffs of
 Dover.The statue was unveiled by Sir  
 Winston's grandson-Mr.Winston         
 Churchill.                            
   This statue was the finishing piece 
 to Mr. Cleary's dream-The{Pines       
{Gardens.}                             </content>
