		<title>15Arable Farming round Haywood</title>
		<content>                                       
Tithe Barn Farm at 350 acres is the    
largest farm, and the only farm in the 
area that is totally arable. This      
grows barley, wheat and some oilseed   
rape. It has its own Combine Harvester 
which is used for a total of only four 
or five weeks each year. For the rest  
of the year it is stored. All the      
grain is stored in a new building      
where it is kept dry with underfloor   
heating until the market is right to   
sell. Machinery is stored in this      
building once the grain is sold.       
Several other farms grow some grain    
crops, contractors being used for the  
harvest. The other main crop in the    
area is grass for silage or hay, as a  
winter feed for the livestock. Lount   
Farm is unique to the area in being    
the only farm that uses completely     
organic fertilizer and no pesticides.  </content>
