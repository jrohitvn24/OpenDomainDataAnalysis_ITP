		<title>15THE SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> A complete sewage scheme for          
Wolverhampton was adopted in 1867. The 
Barnhurst Works are the largest and    
oldest of the Town's four sewage works 
and serves a resident population of    
119,000 plus a large industrial        
population.                            
 Wolverhampton straddles the main      
watershed of England and therefore has 
no large river into which inferior     
effluent can pass unnoticed. Effluent  
from Barnhurst flows into the          
Shropshire Union and Staffordshire and 
Worcestershire Canals. It thus         
requires a high level of treatment     
before it can be discharged into an    
area used for recreational purposes.   
 To ensure this twenty men work shifts 
to keep the Works operating 24 hours a 
day throughout the year. The effluent  
passes through a series of processes   
before being discharged into the canals</content>
