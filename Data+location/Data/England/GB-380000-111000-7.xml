		<title>07INDUSTRY IN SHILLINGSTONE</title>
		<content> There is comparatively little industry
 in the Shillingstone area.            
 In 1924 the Shillingstone lime works  
 was started to extract lime from the  
 Middle Chalk beds in the area by      
 quarrying,and a large area of         
 Shillingstone Hill has now been       
 excavated.The works now cover an area 
 of 34 acres.Annual production around  
 20,000 tons.It is supplied to builders
 merchants throughout the South        
 West,and to farmers as agricultual    
 lime.Pre-war 30 workers employed,now  
 4.There are 3 kilns for burning the   
 limeto make quicklime.                
 In the old railway yard are 3 related 
 firms,Intasco (veneered table tops    
 with brass inlays) Resistec (Brass    
 labels) and Hambledon Furniture (Solid
 wood furniture).Set up 3 years ago    
 they employ around 60 workers.
