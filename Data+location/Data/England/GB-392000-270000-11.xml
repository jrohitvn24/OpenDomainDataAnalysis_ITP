		<title>11WIDENING THE M5, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content>    I live about 60 metres away from   
 where the M5 motorway crosses the     
 Kidderminster road. They are widening 
 the M5. It will go on until 1987. It  
 is being done by the Department of    
 Transport. They brought bulldozers and
 diggers, then started ripping up all  
 the hedging and fencing on the bank.  
 Then they burnt it all. It took two   
 weeks. The black smoke was terrible   
 and we couldn't open our windows.     
    Dust comes out of the trackways    
 when the lorries go over them. They   
 sweep the road every day because big  
 lumps of soil drop off the lorries.   
 They have been digging ditches and    
 putting piping in. Through the day,   
 when they are working, it is very     
 noisy at my house. All the way from my
 house to the motorway bridge there are
 cones and traffic lights, causing long
 traffic jams.                         </content>
