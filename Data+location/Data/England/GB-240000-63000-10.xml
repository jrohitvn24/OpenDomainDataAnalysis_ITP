		<content> An{historic house}in the area is      
 Halton Barton, mentioned in the       
 original Domesday Book. Once the Manor
 House owning most of the surrounding  
 land, this is now a private dwelling. 
 Even the{supernatural}is catered for  
 as the house is believed to be        
 haunted. Other Historical Buildings in
 the area include a Mine Captain's     
 House, a Mine Count House, a former   
 Iron Smelting Works and a former      
 Basket Maker's workshop. A{monument}in
 the area is the mausoleum on the      
 Pentillie Estate. It was built by an  
 eccentric who directed that after his 
 death he should be clothed and seated 
 in his chair. He is still there but   
 flat on his back in a coffin. Evidence
 of{religion}is found in the existence 
 of a Holy Well at Chapel Farm which   
 has a statue of St. Dominica (founder 
 of the local Church) in its niche.    </content>
