		<title>01Hollington,Crowhurst Areas</title>
		<content>  Our area covers the N.W. part of     
 Hastings and St.Leonards, the district
 known as{Hollington.}It extends to the
 West to part of the village of        
{Crowhurst}(6 miles from Hastings      
 Centre). The Northern edge includes   
 the A2100 'Ridge' road at the back of 
 the town.                             
 It is a{mixed area;}from the busy     
{residential}Hollington region, with   
 some industry, to the pretty village  
 of Crowhurst. About two-thirds of our 
 area is{farmland and woodland.}This is
 decreasing each year as more building 
 takes place. Over the last 10 years   
 many new roads, houses and factories  
 have been built. So the region is     
 rapidly changing, and still doing so. 
 The A21 London road, and Hastings to  
 LOndon railway line pass through the  
 region. It is 2 miles to the sea and  
 Hastings Town Centre.                 </content>
