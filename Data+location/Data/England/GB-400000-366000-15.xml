		<content> At the play group there are usually  3
 people running the play group. There  
 are 10 children aged 3 and over and   
 5 children under 3. The play Group    
 has run for 4 years. At half time they
 have a biscuit and a drink of orange, 
 then, when the children have finished 
 their drink, they choose what to do.  
 The children have a choice what to do.
 The choice is to do a jigsaw or ride  
 on the cars or to  play on the        
 climbing frame. After doing the       
 jigsaws and riding on the cars they   
 have a story and after the story the  
 children's mums come and collect the  
 children from play group and they go  
 home .
