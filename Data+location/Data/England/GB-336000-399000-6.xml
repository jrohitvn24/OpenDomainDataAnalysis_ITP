 of spring wheat, ll acres of potatoes,
 40   acres of winter barley, 45 acres 
 of spring barley, 8 acres of savoy    
 cabbages, 3 acres of white cabbage. 96
 acres of the land is grass and 36     
 acres, vegetables.   60% of all crops 
 in our area is grass and grain and 40%
 is vegetables.  You can only put l    
 crop ina field for two years because  
 otherwise you might get a disease of  
 whichever crop you plant.   There is  
 usually a 5 year rotation for each    
 separate field such as cabbages,      
 wheat, rye, cauliflowers and sprouts. 
  Mr. Morrey does not have any animals 
 apart from some chickens and ducks    
 because the land around his area is   
 better for growing crops and he would 
 make a better profit if he grew crops 
 on his land.
