    Willington has its own parish      
 council of 10 elected representatives 
 of the parishioners. Elections to the 
 parish council take place every 3     
 years and from those elected a        
 chairman for each year is chosen. For 
 1985-86 the Parish Council Chairperson
 is Mrs. Cooper.                       
    The parish council exists in order 
 that the local amenities, playing     
 fields,common land etc, may be        
 maintained and local interests        
 fostered.                             
     Willington also forms part of the 
 South Derbyshire District. The local  
 reprsentative on South Derbyshire     
 District Council is Mrs.Bordoli.      
     Each of these councils meet once a
 month to discuss general business; in 
 addition sub-committees deal with     
 specific areas of business.           </content>
