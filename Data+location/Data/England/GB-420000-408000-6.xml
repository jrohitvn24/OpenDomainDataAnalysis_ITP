		<content> All sectors of industry are found in  
 the area.{Primary}activities are      
 largely extractive, particularly of   
 coal (a washing and screening plant in
 Skelmanthorpe), clay (Naylors pipe    
 works) and building stone. (Houses of 
 sandstone still popular, if less so,  
 despite the advent of artificial      
 materials.){Secondary}activities are  
 dominated by the textile industry, now
 much slimmed down and often with      
 foreign backing - artificial fibres   
 much in evidence - producing a more   
 limited range of goods. Field Rugs and
 Shelley Textiles are good examples    
 of the new textile industry. Some old 
 mill premises have been converted to  
 small scale units providing service   
 industry such as car repairing. The{  
{tertiary}sector has seen some growth  
 in leisure activities(eg social clubs)
 and home-based professional firms.    </content>
