		<title>02A SCHOOL HEADMASTER</title>
		<content> It was whilst reading through one of  
 the school log books that I realised  
 that although the log book gives      
 information of the daily happenings it
 doesn't give an insight into the      
 teachers as people.One entry in an    
 early log book states that the head   
 teacher died after 46 years in the    
 school. As to what kind of person he  
 was there is no indication.           
 My name is Richard Murphy and am 52   
 years of age.Born in Belfast I joined 
 the R.A.F.in 1950 and served as a     
 radio technician working on a variety 
 of aircraft. Vulcan, Victor,Javelin.  
 I entered teacher's training college  
 in 1967 and qualified in 1970.        
 I was appointed head of this school in
 Jan.1982. I enjoy my work very much.  
 There are no discipline problems with 
 the children who appear to enjoy the  
 work we do in school.No one gets caned</content>
