		<title>06Cockfield Hall Farm.</title>
		<content> Cockfield Hall is definitely the      
 oldest dwelling in the area,being at  
 least 700 years old.It was built by a 
 Frenchman named Vansour and is a      
 listed building which means that it   
 cannot be structurally altered.It is  
 situated on the Eastern outskirts of  
 the village,behind the church.        
 Cockfield Hall used to be part of     
 Strathmore Estate,belonging at one    
 time to the Earl of Glamis,who was    
 grandfather to Queen Elizabeth IInd.  
 The farm is now owned by Mr and Mrs   
 Bainbridge.They bought it from the    
 Strathmore Estate in 1950,but the     
 Bainbridges have farmed this land for 
 202 years,the early years as tenants. 
 The house and farm buildings are all  
 stone built and it is interesting to  
 see the solid stone walls which are 3 
 ft.thick.All the doorways, even the   
 farm buildings.                       </content>
