 I get up at 7.15 and go downstairs to 
 have my breakfast.  I have Frosties   
 and sometimes bacon. Then I go back   
 upstairs to get dressed and make my   
 bed.  I then watch breakfast TV until 
 we take my dad to work at Faygate     
 Garage where he works from 8.00 to    
 5.30pm. At 8.20 we leave home and get 
 to school at 8.30.  When we get in we 
 read for thirty minutes.  After maths 
 we have an assembly. After a 20       
 minutes playtime we have english and  
 science until lunch.  After lunch we  
 have art and we do all sorts of things
 like painting, clay and drawings.     
 Then we have a radio programme called 
 "In the News".  When I go home I watch
 childrens' programmes on ITV.  Then we
 go to our Nan's.  At 9.00 we go to    
 bed.
