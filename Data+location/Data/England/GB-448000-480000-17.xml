 I walk to school and play football. I 
 do geography or science or maths till 
 lunchtime. I like doing "Dragon World"
 on the computer. At 3.30 I go home and
 play or watch the video or go to the  
 cubs in Thirsk.

 I catch the school bus which comes    
 about 8.15, it goes round 4 villages  
 picking up children for Thirsk School.
 I take a packed lunch. My favourite   
 lesson is geography. On Thursday I go 
 to Athletic Club at school. On Sunday 
 I go riding.

 assembly and wrote a story. After     
 lunch I made a model dragon. When I   
 got home I played on the Village Green
