		<title>09Trimley St.Mary-Landowners</title>
		<content>  Most of Trimley was part of an estate
which was bought by Trinity College,   
Cambridge in the 1930s.  They have sold
some land for house building but they  
still own most of the farm land and the
land on which the dock and warehouses  
have been built.                       
  Some of us went to see the Land      
Agents, Bidwell's, who look after the  
estate for Trinity College.They have an
office in the village.  We were told   
what land agents do. The farms are     
mostly rented and the land agent talks 
to the farmers about their plans and   
decides how much rent to               
charge.Searsons Farm is farmed "in     
hand" by the agent.   We were told     
that most of the land is good          
quality,Grade 2 or 3 agricultural      
land, which would cost about one       
thousand eight hundred pounds an acre.
