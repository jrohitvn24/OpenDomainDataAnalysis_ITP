		<title>14A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SARAH</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7.30 am every morning   
and get washed and dressed. Each school
day I wear school uniform. During the  
summer term a green checked dress or a 
other times grey skirt, white blouse,  
green cardigan and tie. I usually have 
a cooked breakfast before school.      
   At 8.30 I go to St. Mary's Platt    
C.E. Primary School by car. I'm hymn   
book monitor so I get there earlier.   
   The bell goes at 8.58 and we go     
inside for registration, then into the 
hall for assembly. I clear up the hymn 
books and go to the classroom for      
Religious Education and Drama.         
   Break lasts 15 minutes and          
afterwards we have Maths and reading   
workshop. I have school dinners. Then  
we go swimming at Swanley Baths. We    
arrive back and have spelling tests. I 
stay at school for Dance Club and Piano
lesson.                                </content>
