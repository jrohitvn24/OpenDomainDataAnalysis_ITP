The area includes the south-east corner
of Wellingborough, the north-west of   
the village of Great Dodddington, the  
village of Little Irchester and the    
western part of the village of         
Irchester. It is crossed from east to  
west by the new A45 trunk road         
which comes from Northampton which is  
to the south-east. The valley of the   
River Nene extends from the south-west 
corner to the north centre of the      
area. It also includes the A509 road   
from Wellingborough to Newport Pagnell.
Most of the land area is rural and is  
used for various types of farming. Part
of the developing county of Northampton
shire the area has seen great change in
recent years. The valley of the River  
Nene is destined to be radically       
altered in the immediate future because
of gravel extraction.                  </content>
