		<title>17Transport in Pevensey Area</title>
		<content> The{Southdown buses serve}the Pevensey
 area.They are the{186,799 and 199.}The
 799 goes from  Worthing to Rye and the
 186 goes from Eastbourne to Hailsham, 
 via Pevensey Bay. The 199 only runs in
 the summer because it is an open top  
 bus for holiday makers.               
{The railway station}mid-way between   
 Pevensey and Pevensey Bay is ten      
 minutes walk from either village.     
 Trains only stop occasionally and     
 don't link with the hourly bus times. 
 The area is served by three private   
 local{taxi services}of cars and a{mini
{bus}which also takes children to      
 school each day.                      
{Age Concern}recently bought a{welfare 
{ambulance}paid for by public donation.
 It is for the house-bound as it holds 
 5 wheel-chairs.Unfortunately there is 
 nowhere to garage it.
