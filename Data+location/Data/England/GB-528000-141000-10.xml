		<title>10GATWICK PASSENGER TERMINAL</title>
		<content>  We interviewed some local businessmen
 who regularly travel abroad from      
{Gatwick Airport.}All were agreed that 
 Gatwick is a very good international  
 airport. As business travellers with  
 little luggage, they had no need to   
 use porters or trolleys. Neither did  
 they use the car parks, Post Office,  
 Chapel or viewing area. One had had   
 cause to use the medical service which
 was very good. All those interviewed  
 mentioned that there are not enough   
 Customs Officers on duty particularly 
 early in the morning which causes     
 delay. All used the Duty Free Shops to
 buy cigarettes and alcoholic drinks.  
 The various food catering facilities  
 were described as adequate but not as 
 good as those available in some other 
 countries. It was felt that there     
 should be more public telephones      
 within the airport.                   </content>
