		<title>09CHANGES AT IVYLEAF FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Ed Stanbury who owns Ivyleaf Farm  
 has kept an{aerial photographic record
 of which enable farm changes to be    
 plotted.In the early 1950's the farm  
 consisted of the farmhouse and a      
 quadrangle of barns and stores.On the 
 north side of the quadrangle was a    
 second row of stores.                 
    By the early 1970's the southern   
 part of the quadrangle had been       
 removed and a modern barn built.In    
 front of this a garage was also built.
   In the next 10 years the farm       
 expanded and a new large barn was     
 constructed in the small field north  
 of the main block. The rest of this   
 field was excavated and a silage store
 made. Through all of the 30 years the 
 south facing garden has remained the  
 same.
