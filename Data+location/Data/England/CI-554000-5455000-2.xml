		<content> At the time of our survey count (June 
 1985) most of the fields in square    
 05545455 had new potatoes growing in  
 them.                                 
 Jersey Royal early potatoes are a     
 popular crop in Jersey because the    
 farmers can get a good price for them 
 at the beginning of the season. This  
 is because Jersey is further south    
 than England and has a milder climate,
 therefore crops are ready for         
 harvesting earlier than England.      
      Green house grown Jersey Royal   
 potatoes are dug from April onwards,  
 but most of the outdoor crop is       
 harvested from May until the end of   
 July.                                 
     Most of the potatoes are dug by a 
 harvester. A harvester digs up the    
 potatoes from the ground and then     
 passes them along the conveyor belt   
 and back onto the ground.             </content>
