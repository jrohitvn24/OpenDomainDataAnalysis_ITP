		<content> The window shattered, letting in the  
 screaming wind. He ran for the        
 door, groping frantically for the     
 handle. He turned it,the door did not 
 open, it seemed to be locked. He ran  
 to the window, then realised that a   
 fifty foot drop onto concrete would be
 worse than remaining in the room. Or  
 would it? He remembered reading a     
 brass plate in the wall of the tavern 
 which said 'The Red Bedroom is said to
 be haunted by a mad poltergeist which 
 was encounted by King George V when he
 slept at the Inn. He had laughed at   
 the time, but now he was terrified.   
 Suddenly he saw a pair of red eyes    
 gleaming in the darkness. The blood   
 pounded through his temples, he       
 screamed, and blacked out.{
