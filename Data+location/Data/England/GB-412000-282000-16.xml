		<content>IMAGINATIVE GAMES-Mums &amp; Dads, Schools 
When we play mums&amp;dads most people     
like to be a baby but I like to be a   
big girl because I can pretend to put  
high white shoes on &amp; make-up.I also   
have a handbag. Schools:-First we      
pretend to do some work, then we go    
out to play.                           
OLD FAVOURITES-Tig,Skipping,Running,P.E
In Tig someone is on and if they tig   
you, you stand with your arms stretched
out like a scarecrow.You are free when 
girls run under your outstretched arms.
I skip with my friends.Skipping        
skipping,I like skipping is one song we
skip to.Running is a nice game.I some- 
times win &amp; sometimes lose &amp; sometimes 
a draw.When we are allowed on the grass
I do handstands and cartwheels.It is PE
GAMES DRAWN ON THE PLAYGROUND-Hopscotch
I love playing hopscotch because I like
hopping and jumping on the squares.    </content>
