 fifteenth century public house, which

 because it has a hayloft in the roof. 
 It is very small and comfortable . It 
 offers a pleasant bar and a room where
 Pool can be played . During the week  
 it has a few customers but at the     
 weekend it can have up to one hundred 
 people, most of whom come from outside
 the village.                          
      {The Cricketers,}at Easton, was  
 built in 1900 and may also have been a
 farmhouse. It attracts a lot of

 surroundings and good food. It is also
