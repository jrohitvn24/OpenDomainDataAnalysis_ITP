		<title>14A Day in the Life of Steven</title>
		<content>  My day starts at 7.25. I get up and  
 go downstairs. Mum and Dad are already
 there. Breakfast is at 7.45. I get    
 dressed and play with my toys until   
 8.40. I usually walk to school and    
 arrive at 8.55. The bell goes and I   
 walk in with the others. After prayers
 we usually do "Better English" and    
 maths. At 10.30 it is playtime. We    
 have  Environmental Studies after     
 break and then at 12.00 we have lunch.
 I like ham sandwiches for my lunch.   
 During the big playtime I play army   
 games with my friends.                
  At 1.20 we get ready for music and   
 games. After our afternoon playtime we
 have story time. At 3.20 we go home. I
 get changed, then play outside with my
 friend Simon.                         
  For dinner I like sausage and chips. 
 After dinner I watch T.V., have a bath
 and at 8.30 I go to bed.              </content>
