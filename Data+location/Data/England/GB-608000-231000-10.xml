		<title>10Railway Station, Manningtree</title>
		<content> The railway links Manningtree to      
 London and has operated on Diesel     
 power for a long time and D class     
 engines travelled here. Electric lines
 have been introduced on the route from
 Colchester to Ipswich. The Harwich    
 and Ipswich to Norwich lines are in   
 process of changing to electric power.
 The carriages and engines are old     
 stock from the Western and the        
 Midland region. It took 3 years to    
 complete the electrification and 86   
 class engines have been suplied. The  
 new engines were too  light so        
 concrete was put in the bottom.       
 Recently the carriages have been      
 refurnished inside and been given new 
 livery outside.
