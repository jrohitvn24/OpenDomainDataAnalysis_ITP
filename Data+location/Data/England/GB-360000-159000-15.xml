		<title>15CLUTTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      Clutton School was built in 1902.
 The foundation stone was laid by the  
 Countess of Warwick. The first        
 headmaster was Mr. Pullen. His        
 daughter, Mrs. Pritchard, still lives 
 in Clutton. It was a school for all   
 ages until Timsbury Secondary Modern  
 was built in the 1930's. There have   
 only been 4 headmasters since the     
 school was built. They were Mr.       
 Pullen,Mr. Hoyal, Mr.Bick and Mr.     
 Small.                                
     We interviewed Mr. Small, the     
 present Headmaster. He told us that he
 likes working with children. He likes 
 teaching the children and running the 
 school.He likes getting the best      
 equipment for us to use, including the
 computer.Mr. Small thinks that the    
 children are well behaved, kind,      
 thoughtful and helpful.He is pleased  
 about the wide range of sport we do.  </content>
