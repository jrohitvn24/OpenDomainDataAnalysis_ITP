      On Thursday afternoon Alex,      
 Vicky, Simon, Peter, Tim, Melanie and 
 I went for a walk with Mrs. Jesson and
 Mrs. Kennedy and some third years to  
 look at different buildings in        
 Riseley.  Some of the different       
 buildings we saw on the way were      
 shops, bungalows, houses, cottages,   
 barns, farms and the church.  An old  
 cottage opposite Maple Gardens was    
 being renovated and extended and we   
 discovered that the base of the wall  
 was made of stone but above this it   
 was timber in-filled with wattle and  
 daub.  A cottage further along the    
 High Street has one of its rooms used 
 as a craft shop.  A telephone exchange
 is being built to replace the old one 
 in l986.  This will be one of the most
 modern electronic exchanges in the    
 country.                              </content>
