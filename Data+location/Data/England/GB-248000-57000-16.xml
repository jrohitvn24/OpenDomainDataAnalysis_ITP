		<content> A church was first built here in Saxon
 times.  {King Edward} of the West     
 Saxons (975-978) gave his name to it. 
 The church standing today was built in
 143O.  During the Civil War,          
 (1642-1646) the church was vandalised 
 by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers.  It was
 repaired in 1864.  More restoration   
 was done in 1959 after the Second     
 World War.                            
 The present Vicar is the Reverend     
 Charles Whitfield - the 44th.  The    
 parish is much smaller now than in    
 former times, but its population has  
 increased to 14,OOO.                  
 Three services are held each Sunday   
 and major festivals are remembered    
 e.g. Christmas, Good Friday and       
 Ascension Day.  In the past year there
 were 4O weddings and 4O funerals.  53 
 babies were baptised.
