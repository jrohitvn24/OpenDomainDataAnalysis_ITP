		<title>08Wallington Station</title>
		<content>Wallington Station was rebuilt in 1983,
and is now a tall black building.      
Before that there was a house built on 
top and there was a long row of houses 
alongside. The longest train that goes 
through Wallington is an 8 carriage    
one. There are 2 people needed to oper-
ate each train;a driver and a guard.   
The first train starts at 5:45am and   
the last train comes in at 12:08pm.    
8 people work at Wallington Station in 
the ticket office, on barriers and in  
general station maintenance. 5000      
people travel on trains from Wallington
each day. New trains have been intro-  
duced. They are cleaner and lighter and
doors are operated by people inside the
train.
