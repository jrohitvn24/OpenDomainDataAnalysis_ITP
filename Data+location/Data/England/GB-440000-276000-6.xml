		<title>06BRANDON HALL HOTEL,COVENTRY.</title>
		<content>   The old  part of the hotel was built
 in the 1600's as a shooting lodge.    
 James Beech bought it in the late     
 1800's.With his family he moved into  
 the shooting lodge after improving it 
 and it became known as Brandon Hall.  
 The Manor House deteriorated into     
 ruins.A descendant of James Beech     
 commissioned the building of Brandon  
 Club and Brandon School and another   
 descendant set up polo grounds at the 
 Hall.The Duke of Windsor played here  
 many times.A local farmer now grazes  
 sheep on the polo grounds,to the east 
 of the hotel. In Brandon Little Wood, 
 formerly part of the Hall, there is an
 ice-well.This was used for preserving 
 game shot in the Manor Grounds.       
   After World War II ended the Manor  
 land was split between the villagers  
 who were tenants.In 1946 the Hall was 
 made into a 25 bedroom hotel.         </content>
