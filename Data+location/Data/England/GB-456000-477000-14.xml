		<content>  From the cricket pavilion looking    
 towards the school,Junior House can be
 seen on the extreme left. Next is St. 
 Cuthbert's House in early 20th        
 Century style.                        
  A new infirmary for elderly monks is 
 being constructed on the left-hand end
 of the Monastery. The Abbey Church    
 ajoins the opposite end. To the right 
 of the church stands the Old House    
 (Geogian). This is being demolished to
 be replaced by a major redevelopment  
 of this central area.                 
  Further to the right is a large      
 building which includes St.John's and 
 St.Aidan's houses,the College Library,
 the Laboratories, and the Headmaster's
 rooms. To the south of this complex is
 the Theatre and Gymnasium. Attached to
 these is the new Music Centre which is
 nearing completion.
