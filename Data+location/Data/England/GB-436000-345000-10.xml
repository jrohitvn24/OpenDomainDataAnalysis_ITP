		<title>10KILBURN(DERBY)AREA FARM LAND</title>
		<content> Most of our area farmland is given    
 over to grazing for cattle, being a   
 mixture of rough grazing and          
 cultivated meadow. The majority of the
 milk thus produced goes to supply     
 local demand, a small percentage going
 to the making of dairy produce. Pigs  
 and poultry are kept on an individual 
 farms but in small numbers only with  
 no local policy or pattern. Several   
 local farmers also grow crops, chiefly
 barley,with an occasional crop of kale
 or marigold. The area is also         
 criss_crossed by a network of         
 footpaths, and local farmers respect  
 their existence. The area is little   
 affected by tourism, since the most   
 visitors are passing through on their 
 way elsewhere. Denby Pottery is       
 probably the only spot in the area to 
 attract visitors from any distance.
