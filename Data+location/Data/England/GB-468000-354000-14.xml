{recreational purposes.} Families go   
 for walks at the weekends along it.   
 At the right time of year, you can see
 people picking elderberries and       
 blackberries.  They will use these for
 making jams and stewed fruit.         
   At the Southwell end of the trail,  
 some new house are being built in a   
 development called{'Riverside Park'.  
 These are mainly{detatched houses}and 
 they cost between Â£5O,OOO and Â£7O,OOO 
 each.                                 
   At Maythorne, where there is still a
 farm, some old warehouses have been   
 converted into{flats.} These cost

 various craftsmen working here.  There
