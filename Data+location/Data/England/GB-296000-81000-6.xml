		<title>06STILE FARM</title>
		<content>{Stile Farm}is a very big one owned by 
{Lord Courtenay.}It has roughly 3700   
 acres of land. 1200 acres of land are 
 crops. Barley, potatoes, corn, wheat, 
 swede and peas are grown. Of course,  
 machinery is also on the farm. There  
 are 8 tractors, combine and potato    
 harvesters, rollers, balers and       
 fertiliser spreaders. A lot of the    
 land is used for animals. They have   
 mostly South Devon cows and sheep.    
 Some of the cows are used for beef and
 the sheep are sheared in the middle of
 May. They have 5 workers, 2 of which  
 are only part time. Farmers have      
 trouble with rabbits and mice. Rats   
 come from the river and crows eat the 
 crops. In the winter animals and crops
 are put in barns. Cattle eat silage,  
 barley and hay. Sheep eat hay, silage 
 and root crops.The Common Market has  
 caused a great increase in paperwork. </content>
