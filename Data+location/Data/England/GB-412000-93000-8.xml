		<content> Our school had a litter problem until 
 they stopped the tuck-shop selling    
 food with wrappers,we also had new    
 yellow bins installed.Another thing   
 that helped our litter problem was the
 Break-appeal,everyone saves their     
 Kit-Kat wrappers,then they are sent to
 the Break-appeal for the Deprived     
 Children.Each wrapper is worth        
 3p.There is still one problem,the     
 canteen is still selling sweets with  
 wrappers,the main litter is 'crisp    
 packets'.Hopefully they won't stop    
 selling the crisps because if they    
 did they'd lose a lot of profit.In    
 every assembly the Head-of-Year tells 
 us how the litter problem is          
 improving,he said it's not one person 
 dropping 1000's of pieces of litter,  
 its 1000's of people dropping one     
 piece of litter.We also have a sign   
 saying 'keep this school tidy'.       </content>
