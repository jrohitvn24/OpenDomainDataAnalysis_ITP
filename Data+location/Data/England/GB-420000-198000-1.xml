		<content>{WHERE IS IT?}Lechlade is on the River 
 Thames. It is a small town in         
 Gloucestershire, close to the borders 
 of Oxfordshire and Wiltshire.         
{ROADS.}From London travel along the M4
 and turn off at Swindon. Continue     
 along the A345, join the A417 and then
 along the A361 through Highworth, then
 into Lechlade.                        
{FEATURES}The main features are the    
{River Thames}and the fifteenth century
{Church of St. Lawrence,}re-named by   
{Catherine of Aragon,}one time resident
 of the{Manor House,}as well as a      
 number of fine old houses. Follow     
{Shelley's Walk,}the path through the  
 churchyard named after the poet who   
 penned his Stanzas there in 1815 and  
 you arrive at the school. Lechlade is 
 a popular tourist spot because boating
 on the Thames begins there and it is  
 within easy reach of the{Cotswolds.   </content>
