		<title>01Wem - An introduction</title>
		<content>   Wem is a small town of about 4,500  
 people on the flat, fertile land of   
 north Shropshire. It grew up as a     
 market town and agriculture is still  
 the main employer.In the town there   
 are a large brewery, an animal feeds  
 mill and a sawmill and joinery, plus  
 several firms that construct farm     
 buildings or install equipment.Many   
 other people work in the local council
 offices or commute to Shrewsbury, only
 15 minutes away by train.             
   Wem lies away from main trunk roads 
 but apart from a hospital, it has most
 of the things that people need.       
 Besides a good range of shops,there   
 are many clubs and activities         
 sporting, social and academic. A      
 typical example is the annual         
 carnival held in September. Local     
 people are proud of their town. Few   
 people move into or out of the area.  </content>
