		<title>09Cossington traffic survey</title>
		<content> We wanted to findout how much traffic 
 passed through Cossington in a week.We
 thought that people in the future     
 would like this information.The main  
 road that passes through our village  
 is the B5328 , and our survey took    
 place in June 1985.We stood outside   
 the school from 7.30 to 9.15 am and   
 from 4.45 to 6.00 pm and this is      
 what we found out.We found out that in
 that whole week 5787 cars, lorrys,    
 vans,motorbikes, bikes, tractors,     
 buses,went through Cossington.Of this 
 total there were 4283 cars, 451 vans, 
 218 lorries, 305 bikes, 299           
 motorbikes, 25 tractors  and 48 buses.
 While we were doing the survey it was 
 somtimes cold and miserable and misty 
 but we got rewarded with a cup of tea 
 or coffee made by Mrs Cooper our      
 dinner lady . by simon Milner
