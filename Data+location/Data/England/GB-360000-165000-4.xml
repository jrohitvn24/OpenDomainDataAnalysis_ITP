		<title>04Development in Whitchurch</title>
		<content> In June 1984 some twenty or so new    
 houses called the Witheys were built  
 close to the village school.Also by   
 August 1985 more development(again    
 about 20 houses) will be completed and
 be called the Bridge Park             
 estate,Staunton Fields. Some people   
 are not keen on the new development as
 they say it spoils the character of   
 the village but others say that       
 without some development the village  
 will die. Many people are now old who 
 live in the village and new houses    
 mean that younger people and children 
 are moving into the neighbourhood. The
 Parish Council is trying to buy a     
 local Church Hall to turn into a      
 Village Hall to be a focal point for  
 the old and the new residents of      
 Whitchurch Village.
