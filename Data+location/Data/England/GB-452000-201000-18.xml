		<content>     After that we do some knitting    
because we are making blankets to go   
to Africa.   At l2.00 it is lunch-time 
and I have a school lunch in the       
canteen.   After playtime we come in   
and finish off our work or listen to a 
story read by our teacher.   At the end
of the day we are told what we need to 
bring to school the next day, and then 
we go home.                            
     When I get home I play with my    
sister for a while and then have tea.  
If it is a Wednesday I go to the Red   
Cross to learn about First Aid.   We   
learn to put on bandages or have a     
test.   After that we have a drink or  
snack at the bar.   When I get home I  
might do some colouring and have       
something to eat.   Then I watch       
television and play with my sister.    
I then read for a while and go to bed  
between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m.            </content>
