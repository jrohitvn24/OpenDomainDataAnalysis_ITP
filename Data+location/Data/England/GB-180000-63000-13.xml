		<content> It has been speculated that the       
 ramparts were a status symbol-the     
 bigger they were the more important   
 its builders were. In l939, Mr.Croft  
 Andrew excavated Trevelgue, but as the
 war built up in intensity, the        
 excavations had to stop, due to a lack
 of resources. This meant that there   
 was not a thorough excavation.Also    
 little information was published. In  
 l949 in the November/December         
 Archaeology Newsletter, a short       
 account of the excavation was written 
 by Croft Andrew. A full report of the 
 excavation has never been written but 
 this year (1985) a report is in       
 progress. The finds made and reported 
 in the 1940 newsletter were varied and
 spanned considerable time.
