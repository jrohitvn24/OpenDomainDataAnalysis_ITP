		<content> The area is well served by Doctors    
 Miller and Dudbridge. The             
 purpose-built surgery is located at   
 the rear of the Village Hall. Surgery 
 times are 8 to 9.30 am daily except   
 Fridays and Sundays. There is one     
 evening surgery on Tuesdays 5.30 to   
 6.30 pm. There is also a Pharmacy     
 incorporated. Most medicines can be   
 supplied from there but if not they   
 can be dispensed in Crediton and      
 collected from Cheriton Bishop Post   
 Office. Funds raised by villagers in  
 1983 purchased an Electro-cardiograph 
 Resuscitator and Nebuliser. Patients  
 can be attended at home by the        
 District Nurse. Geriatric patients'   
 residential centres are at Okehampton,
 Crediton and Exeter. General and      
 maternity cases go to Exeter. Meals   
 cooked at Tedburn St Mary are         
 delivered twice weekly to the elderly.</content>
