		<content> Chesterton is a residential suburb to 
 the south of Cirencester.It stands 400
 ft.above sea level,the land slopes    
 gently away to the south.Built mainly 
 since the end of World War 2,at first 
 by the Council and then by private    
 development,the third phase is still  
 under construction and is planned to  
 eat into 60 acres of farmland in the  
 SW in the near future. Mixed arable   
 farming is carried on in the area.    
 Parts of 7 such are in this block. To 
 the east is a small industrial estate 
 of firms which serve the engineering, 
 building,home improvement &amp; transport 
 industries.To the east of this is the 
 village of Siddington joined to       
 Cirencester by a short stretch of     
 ribbon development.Here are to be     
 found the usual village buildings,    
 church,school and pub.
