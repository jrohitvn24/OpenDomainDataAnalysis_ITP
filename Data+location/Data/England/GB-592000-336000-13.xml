		<title>13The Walsingham Shirehall</title>
		<content> The flint_walled Shirehall was part of
 the medieval Priory precinct.Its first
 floor hall had an impressive roof     
 covered with Colleyweston "slates".In 
{1778}it was converted to house the    
 Quarter Sessions dealing with County  
 business and dispensing justice.The   
 facade acquired a new parapet,windows 
 and doors,while internally the first  
 floor was removed and the lofty       
 chamber fitted with a tiny public     
 gallery and cramped benches for       
 magistrates,lawyers and jurors.The    
 accused stood to be tried just a few  
 paces from the lock_up with its barred
 window,ironwork grille and primitive  
 urinal.The courtroom is very          
 evocative of the {Georgian}era.{      
{Quarter Sessions}ceased in{1861}but{  
{Petty Sessions}remained until{1971.}  
 The Shirehall then became a local     
 museum.                               </content>
