		<content>   The canal which goes through the    
 village is the Trent and Mersey.Lots  
 of barges and canal boats make a stop 
 on their journey at Willington for    
 water intake or to visit one of the   
 pubs or shops.                        
   Years ago the canal was used to     
 transport  fuels like coal,coke, peat 
 and other manufactured goods across   
 the country to ports or towns.        
   Willington had storage wharves and a
 turning point for the long boats.     
   Now the canal is solely used for    
 pleasure boat cruises, holiday boating
 or 'on-board' boat parties.           
   Beside the canal at Willington is a 
 picnic area which, during the summer  
 months,is used extensively by visitors
 to the village as a stopping point to 
 break their journey near to the       
 tranquillity of the now redundant     
 canal.                                </content>
