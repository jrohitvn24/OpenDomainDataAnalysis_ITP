		<title>02Roads of the Beechdale Est.</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Beechdale Estate is defined by a  
 network of roads important in both    
 local and national terms.The west of  
 the estate is bounded by the M6       
 Motorway,which has the dubious        
 distinction of having one of the      
 highest traffic densities in the      
 country.This is the major traffic     
 route from the South and the West to  
 the North West and Scotland.          
 The Estate is split into two by the   
 only route from the M6 to the         
 industrial estate.This residential    
 road,often busy with Class 2 Heavy    
 Goods Vehicles,also provides much of  
 the Estate with its most practical    
 means of access to the amenities of   
 the area.The traffic flow of the road 
 often exceeds at peak perids two      
 thousand vehicles per hour.
