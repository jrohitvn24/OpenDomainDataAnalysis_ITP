		<title>20LIFE IN MARKET RASEN</title>
		<content> Whilst having a small population,     
 there is much in Market Rasen that    
 towns with larger ones could be       
 envious. The sporting facilities are  
 good with golf and race courses. There
 are 7 pubs and a working mens' club   
 offering the usual entertainments!    
 The Festival Hall near the Market     
 Place is the venue for many events.   
 Dances,discos and concerts regularly  
 are held and occasionally popular     
 entertainers appear. The hall is also 
 the focus of town occasions such as   
 Xmas carol concerts and civic         
 functions. The town retains its quiet 
 atmosphere and life is leisurely.It is
 the focus of the small villages around
 it and in part retains the role it has
 had since the Middle Ages. Its        
 pleasant site at the foot of the Wolds
 with wooded land and quiet footpaths  
 make it a delightful place to live.   </content>
