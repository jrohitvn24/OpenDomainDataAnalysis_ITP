		<title>01THE MENDIPS</title>
		<content>    This part of the Mendips is an area
 of intensively managed farmland with a
 patchwork quilt of fields. The valleys
 are sites for many villages and       
 hamlets containing many old stone     
 built houses and cottages.            
    Dairy farming predominates, though 
 farmers on the higher ground in       
 particular, also keep sheep. The dairy
 farmers manage their grassland        
 intensively, producing silage, hay and
 grazing. An increasing number of      
 fields are being used to produce      
 grains, following the new milk quota  
 regulations of 1984.                  
    Architecturally, there are many    
 fine buildings, not least the churches
 in this area. Older buildings have    
 been constructed with a variety of    
 local stones which blend into the     
 landscape. Mendip dry stone walls are 
 a feature unique to this area.        </content>
