		<title>07TWO VILLAGE CHURCHES (C.E.)</title>
		<content>  One vicar{(Yate Team Ministry)}looks 
 after both{Westerleigh}(st.James the  
 Great)and{Wapley}(St.Peter)churches.  
 The first vicar was appointed in 1269.
 An original farm{monastery}was        
 destroyed by Henry V111 and the       
 present churches date from the 15th   
 and 16th centuries.                   
{ Morning services,}mostly Holy        
 Communion,are held at Westerleigh.    
 Mixed{evening services}are held at    
 Wapley.The vicar finds some difficulty
 rushing between the churches          
 especially for Saturday{weddings.     
 Numbers of{churchgoers}from the       
 villages,rural areas and Yate,have    
 risen at Westerleigh over the last few
 years.At Wapley,numbers tend to       
 increase in the summer.Cold,dark      
 winter evenings probably deter peole  
 from going out along the small country
 lanes to the churches.                </content>
