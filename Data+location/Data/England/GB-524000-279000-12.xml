		<title>12Religion in Wistow area</title>
		<content> The religious picture of the community
 is not encouraging.  At the present   
 time there is no Church operational in
 either Great or Little Raveley and    
 this is due to falling attendances.   
 Main religious belief in this area has
 always been Methodist and Church of   
 England.  Great Raveley used to have a
 Methodist Chapel but it has been      
 demolished block by block and rebuilt 
 in Warboys some 40-50 years ago.  At  
 Little Raveley the Church of England  
 Church closed in recent years and has 
 now been converted to a private       
 residence. At Wistow the Baptist      
 Chapel has closed and is now used as  
 the Village Hall.  People of all      
 religious creeds in the area who wish 
 to worship do so by travelling to     
 Ramsey or Upwood.  There are also     
 people of the Catholic faith living in
 this area, they also travel to Ramsey.</content>
