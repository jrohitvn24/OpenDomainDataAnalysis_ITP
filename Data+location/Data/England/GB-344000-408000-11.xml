		<title>11The Lunds:It's a dog's life!</title>
		<content>Les &amp; June Lund run Qualco kennels on  
the corner of Flax Lane\Hobcross Lane. 
Originally a pub,"Scutcher's Arms",the 
kennels have operated since 1970.The   
Lund's find that holiday times are     
particularly busy for them eg. Xmas,New
Year,Easter and the summer months.     
However,many leave their pets for long 
weekends whilst they take a break.     
Les &amp; June breed a variety of dogs inc.
Bulldogs,Miniature &amp; Giant Schnauzers, 
Airedale Terriers,Great Danes &amp;        
Pekingese.They have exported dogs all  
over the world and have champions in   
USA,Italy,France,Australia &amp; UK.       
When asked about the problems running a
kennels they said being woken in the   
middle of the night by owners returning
from holiday was the worst!They also   
confirmed the notion that where there  
is a grumpy dog you can be sure to     
find a grumpy owner!                   </content>
