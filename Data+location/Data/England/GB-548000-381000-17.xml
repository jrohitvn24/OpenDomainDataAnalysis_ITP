		<title>17Sutton in 100 Years.</title>
		<content> I think that in 100 years Sutton will 
 be all amusement arcades and it will  
 be very busy.There will be a lot moe  
 shops and I think that they will knock
 all the old shops down and build new  
 ones.There might be a leisure centre  
 and a fair.There will probably be a   
 bigger school and a Nuclear Power     
 Station.I don't think there will be an
 11+ either.There will be an airport   
 with lots of planes flying everywhere.
 There will be conveyer belts in the   
 shops and electric doors which you    
 have to sat a password to open        
{-Matthew Lockley.                     
 I think that Sutton on Sea will be    
 spoilt by skyscrapers and cars and    
 pollution but there will be advantages
 because there will be bigger shops and
 stores and people will not have to    
 walk all over town looking for certain
 shops{-Mark Edwards.                  </content>
