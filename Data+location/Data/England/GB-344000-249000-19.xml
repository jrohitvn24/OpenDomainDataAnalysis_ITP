		<content> The premises of the old Crown Inn are 
 now used by a firm of{agricultural    
{engineers}and suppliers of farm       
 machinery.Until recently a family firm
 it is now a partnership with offices  
 in Hereford Market.It mainly deals in 
{potato harvesting machinery.}Their    
 sales area covers Hereford &amp; Worcester
 Salop,Gloucestershire and all the way 
 to Pembrokeshire.They deal in new and 
 second hand products except tractors. 
 Most of their business and{profit     
 comes from the sale of{spare parts}and
 the repair of faulty equipment.This   
 often means their mechanics have to   
 travel to remote farms in all weathers
 to carry out urgent repairs.Harvest   
 time is their busiest season.Foreign  
 makes have mostly taken over from     
 British manufacturers because they are
 cheaper.Many British firms have and   
 are still going out of business.      </content>
