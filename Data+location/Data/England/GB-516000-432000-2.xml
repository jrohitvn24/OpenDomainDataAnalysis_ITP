		<content> Bilton and Sproatley are the main     
 pockets of population in our region,  
 but there are also numerous houses    
 at Wyton and Thirtleby,ranging from   
 small bungalows to large detached     
 houses set in their own grounds.      
 With the exception of the main Hull   
 to Withernsea road that runs through  
 Bilton all the roads in our block are 
 'B'class roads.There is also quite a  
 number of footpaths offering walks    
 around the villages.                  
 The facilities in the region are      
 studied in greater detail in the next 
 pages along with pages about working  
 days of different occupations,visits  
 to two farms,and comments about the   
 children's ideas on school,fashion and
 entertainment in the 1980's.
