		<title>17SHREWTON AND THE RIVER TILL</title>
		<content> We walked along a path by the River   
 Till. There were lots of trees by the 
 water: Willow, Elm, Poplar, Snowberry,
 Hawthorn, Beech and Fir trees. The    
 stinging nettles had grown a lot and  
 we had a job avoiding them.           
 The river varies between three and    
 four metres wide and the banks were   
 low in parts because they had been    
 flooded.                              
 When we were looking at the river we  
 saw some Mallard ducks and some       
 Moorhens with their red bills and     
 white patches on their tails.         
 In a nearby field we saw some sheep, a
 horse, goats, two geese, a cat and a  
 dog.                                  
 Recently a sponsored group of village 
 people have been clearing a lot of    
 weed and rubbish from the river bed,  
 prior to it filling up with water     
 again.                                </content>
