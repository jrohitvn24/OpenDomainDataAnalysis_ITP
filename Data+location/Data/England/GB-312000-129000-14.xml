 Combe Florey is also remarkable for   
 its old sandstone gatehouse (1593),   
 all that is left of the medieval manor
 house cmplex; there is a later house  
 of 1793, however, which stands at the 
 top of the hill. But Combe Florey is  
 remarkable for two famous literary    
 nAmes : the rector from 1829 was      
 Sydney Smith who, though he feared the
 country as a kind of "healthy grave"  
 was extremely pleased with his        
 parish.He described it as " a very    
 pretty place in a very beautiful      
 country".                             
 The second manor house was occupied   
 until his death in 1966 by the author 
 and wit, Evelyn Waugh.
