		<content>    The village is now a strange island
 of antiquity in a sea of              
 prefabrication.The layout of the      
 village remains very much unaltered,  
 though its importance to the community
 has dwindled.The farms have either    
 lost their lands or are used as riding
 stables.The old school has been       
 replaced by more modern buildings.    
  The pubs and corner shops have       
 closed,to be replaced by a larger,more
 functional set of buildings.          
  {Bidston}is surrounded by a large,   
 recent housing estate ({The Ford}),an 
 equally large housing estate built in 
 the 1930's,{Bidston Hill}which is a   
 significant{Wirral}landmark and a vast
 expanse of open wetland known as{     
{Bidston Moss}.
