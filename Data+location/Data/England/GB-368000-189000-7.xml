		<content> There are 2 local news letters. One is
 "The Cromhall News Letter" printed by 
 the village association. It is printed
 3 times a year. It includes topics    
 such as "The Rector writes", lost     
 property, gardening tips, recipes,    
 local history, clubs and dates. Recent
 articles have mentioned the extention 
 to the school, protest at heavy       
 traffic through the village, proposed 
 bus cuts and cleaning out the pond.   
 The other news letter is "Cromhall,   
 Tortworth and Tytherington News" which
 is the church news letter. In the July
 1985 edition the Rector wrote about   
 the problem of dumping of rubbish and 
 litter in the village.
