		<content> There are also moorhens, pigeons, wild
 ducks and  geese,  hedgehogs,  weasels
 and   stoats.  There  have  been a few
 changes in  the  wildlife, but  one of
 the main ones is that the rabbits were
 very nearly wiped out with myxomatosis
 but  they are  now   coming  back very
 rapidly. Also  foxes, frogs  and toads
 have almost disappeared and the       
 wildlife is not what it used to be.   
           PESTICIDE SPRAYS.           
 Pesticide  sprays have done great harm
 to all  British  wildlife.There aren't
 any butterflies compared to what there
 used to be. Many used to keep bees and
 pigs but  today only a few  keep their
 own hives of bees or their own pigs.  
                SHOPS.                 
 The 1st shop in the village was a but-
 chers, followed by a grocers. Cigar-  
 ettes would cost 11.5p in old money.  
 A shopkeeper owned the 1st car.       </content>
