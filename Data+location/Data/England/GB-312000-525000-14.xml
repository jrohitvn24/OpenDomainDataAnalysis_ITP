		<title>14Trade in Lorton</title>
		<content> There is very little trade carried on 
 in this area. The shop in Low Lorton  
 benefits more from the seasonal       
 tourist than local shoppers who often 
 shop in nearby towns. This shop offers
 all forms of groceries and dry goods. 
 Also, on Sundays which is their       
 busiest day, newspapers. The          
 Wheatsheaf Inn is also dependant on   
 tourists staying in the area and to   
 some extent day trippers from nearby  
 towns. A small transport business     
 operates from a nearby farm.  The only
 other trading in Lorton is a nusery   
 garden which was started 5 years ago  
 and now sells plants and trees at     
 various town markets throughout the   
 County of Cumbria.
