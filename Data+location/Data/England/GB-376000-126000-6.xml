		<content>    In this area there are no parks or 
 recreation grounds, but people do find
 time for leisure activities. All the  
 private gardens are beautiful because 
 the villagers keep them tidy as they  
 are proud of their villages. Some     
 people like to sit in their gardens   
 and read the newspaper.               
    In summer there is a lot to do. You
 can go swimming at the Milton Lodge   
 Hotel,or fishing in the River Stour,  
 or for lovely walks. You can do       
 gardening or go horseriding or play   
 tennis.A lot of people go to the      
 nurseries because gardening is their  
 main hobby. There are nice places and 
 lanes to go walking and jogging. Some 
 fields and woods are good areas for   
 picnics.
