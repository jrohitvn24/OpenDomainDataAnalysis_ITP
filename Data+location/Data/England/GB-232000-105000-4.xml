 I am school dinners and most of my    
 friends are school dinners so we talk 
 a lot.The school dinners are nice     
 sometimes.We come out of dinner at    
 1.00pm and the packed lunches go in   
 for their  dinner until 1.30pm,while  
 we have our playtime.The whistle goes 
 at 1.30pm.We come in and do our topic.
                                       
 Our topic is "The Domesday Project",we
 do this until 2.45pm and then we go   
 out to play.At 3.00pm we come in and  
 have a story.The bus children go at   
 3.30pm and the town children go at    
 3.45pm.                               
                                       
 I walk with my friend to the car park 
 and my mum picks us up there and takes
 us home.                              </content>
