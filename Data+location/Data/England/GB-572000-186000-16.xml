<title>16Pitsea and St Micheal and All Angels Church</title>
<content>My wife and I were the last couple to be married in the church in 1971, her parents managed the Railway pub, in Pitsea. The church was later vandalised, because of it's isolation and all but the tower was demolished. The tower was converted to hide mobile telephone masts. The Railway has closed and the future of this mock Tudor building is uncertain. In the daly 1970's the Railway was a stopping off place for coaches taking "Beano" partys to, and from, Southend. In the peak season unto sixty coaches would be parked behind the pub on waste land behind the pub, which is now occupied by Pitsea Market.&lt;br />
