		<title>11DAIRY FARMING IN A_J_M</title>
		<content>                                       
{Dairy farming}is the main branch of   
 agriculture.The two main breeds kept  
 are{Friesians and Holsteins}The latter
 give more milk but the former better  
 beef.The cow is first taken to a      
{Hereford bull},usually kept by the    
 farmer as they are docile,because this
 gives a smaller calf.In subsequent    
 years the cow will be{artificially    
{inseminated}with a Friesian or        
 Holstein.The bull calves will probably
 be sold on at 4 weeks.The effect of   
 the common agricultural policy of the 
{European Economic Community}which     
 restricts the amount of milk sold by  
 each farmer,called the{milk quota},has
 adversely affected the dairy farmer.  
 Cow calves are less valuable than     
 previously,and some farmers are       
 diversifying into beef or cereals.
