		<title>15LITTLE STOKE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village of Little Stoke is        
situated on the B 5027 which branches  
off the A 51. The first thing to be    
seen is a scrap yard reclaiming metal  
products. The village possesses a      
public house namely the Three Crowns.  
Next to this is a Victorian postbox    
with 'VR' on. Near the level crossing  
is the old Aston-by-Stone station.     
 Recently the village is being         
increasingly 'swallowed' up by         
development around Stone. Fradley Homes
have been developing 'high class'      
houses on an estate near Blackies Lane.
Opposite this new building is Little   
Stoke Cricket Club. This was founded in
1946.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
