		<title>09FOOD WE EAT AT WEEKENDS.</title>
		<content> We did a survey on what people ate at 
 weekends.                             
 Most people have cereal for breakfast 
 on  Saturday and Sunday with fresh    
 orange to drink.On Sunday most people 
 have a cooked meal with yorkshire     
 puddings,joint and 2 vegatables.For   
 puddings people had icecream, chocol- 
 ate cake, strawberry and cream, pie,  
 fruit salad and yogurt.A lot of people
 had snacks like chocolate, Fireballs, 
 Gobstoppers,Mars Bars, Smarties,      
 Maltesers and Jelly Babies. We like   
 to drink things in cans like Coke,    
 Quatro, Lucozade,Orange, Lemonade and 
 Seven up. These are fizzy drinks.     
 Mums and Dads like to drink wine and  
 beer with meals at the weekend. When  
 we do the shopping on Saturday we     
 often go to a cafe for food. Often we 
 eat fish and chips at the cafe with   
 coke or milk shake to drink.          </content>
