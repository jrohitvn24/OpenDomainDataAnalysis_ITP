		<content> In our wood there are a lot of rabbit 
 holes and fox holes.Some of them you  
 cant tell which is a rabbit hole and  
 which is a fox hole. Some of the holes
 are badgers holes.Badgers eat bulbs,  
 small creatures like mice,rats,earth  
 worms,roots and berries.Foxes eat     
 small creatures and berries.At night  
 foxes hunt for rabbits.They kill lambs
 but they do not eat them.They take    
 over a rabbit burrow or badgers       
 sets.The badgers are very clean       
 animals.When you go to the wood you   
 can see the badgers foot prints on    
 their setts.The sett in Seagry Wood   
 has been there for 100 years.The      
 tunnels lead to lots of rooms.Some    
 tunnels are left to let fresh air in  
 to the sett.The trees are             
 oak,ash,horse chestnut and sweet      
 chestnut.There are also ferns and     
 fungi.                                </content>
