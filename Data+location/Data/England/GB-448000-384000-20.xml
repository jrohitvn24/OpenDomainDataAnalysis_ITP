		<title>20Sports Day at Anston Brook</title>
		<content> Mrs.B.Moseley, the Junior school's    
 first{parent-governor,}describes our  
 Sports Day (10th.July 1985).          
 Today is my younger son's school      
{sports day.}This takes place on the   
 school sports field and is when the   
 children at the school compete        
 informally in a variety of races.     
 There are straightforward running     
 races and very entertaining novelty   
 events, such as the egg and spoon     
 race, the sack race and the obstacle  
 race. My son is entered for the sack  
 race. The children stand with their   
 feet in a sack and hop or shuffle to  
 the finishing line. This is not a     
 serious competetive occasion but an   
 informal gathering of children, their 
 parents and school staff, all of whom 
 seem to enjoy themselves. There is    
 often a staff/parents race which the  
 children greatly enjoy.               </content>
