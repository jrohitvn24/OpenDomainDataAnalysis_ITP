		<title>02The Mere At Alsager</title>
		<content> The Mere is a main attraction in      
 Alsager. It was formed by a natural   
 spring, and developed from marshland  
 to a beautiful sight and attraction.  
 In the early 19th century there was   
 only one building around the Mere,    
 this was an Inn. About 50 years ago   
 the Mere was drained so it was        
 possible to build houses. Now the Mere
 is surrounded with large houses with 2
 small areas for public access-gardens.
 There have not been any problems of   
 subsidence, so the drainage must be   
 effective. The only problem is that   
 the people in the public gardens often
 make a noise late at night. There are 
 approximately 40 houses around the    
 Mere in a variety of sizes. The       
 problem of the public gardens only    
 affects a few of these houses around  
 the Mere. The Mere is used by the     
 residents for boating and swimming.   </content>
