		<title>02Clacton's Holiday Camps</title>
		<content>    We have got quite a few holiday    
 camps in our part of Clacton. Their   
 prices range from Â£30 in the low      
 season to about Â£160 in the high      
 season for one week's holiday.        
                                       
    In the bigger camps you will       
 probably find that you will have to   
 pay a little bit more, which is quite 
 reasonable because they will have much
 more in them. In the little camps you 
 will probably find a small swimming   
 pool, a few shops and a play area. In 
 the bigger camps you will find a much 
 bigger swimming pool, many more shops,
 clubs, pubs, arcades and equipment    
 hire shops.                           
                                       
    The camps provide a lot of jobs for
 local people, especially in the       
 summer.
