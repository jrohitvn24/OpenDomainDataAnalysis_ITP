		<title>01CENTRAL LINCOLN.</title>
		<content> Our  area  contains a wide  variety of
 different  types  of land cover.In the
 south  east  there  is  the  exclusive
 village  of{Canwick}surrounded by farm
 land.{South Common}also covers much of
 the  southern  portion (used for golf,
 grazing and general public recreation)
 Much of our area is{ residential} with
 its  Victorian  and Edwardian{terraced
 houses. Lincoln's shrinking  number of
 of factories  are located close to the
 railways  in the centre of our square.
 North of the{River Witham,}which  cuts
 across  the  city, is the shopping and
 commercial  centre. Here you will find
 much of Lincoln's past-{Roman gateways
{the Norman castle,Medieval houses}and,
 overshadowing everything,the{Cathedral
 The ground rises steeply from the city
 centre  to  historic{'uphill'}Lincoln.
{Some }of  the  newer  buildings  blend
 successfully with the old.            </content>
