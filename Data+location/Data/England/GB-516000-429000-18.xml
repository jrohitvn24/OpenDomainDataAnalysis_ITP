		<content> The local racecourse and airfield.    
 Two of the outstanding features of our
 area is the fact that it contained    
 both a race course and an airfield.   
 In 1883 a number of local men got     
 together to form the E.Riding Club    
 and Racecourse Co.The site extended to
 267 acres and was customary to see    
 nobility frequenting it.There was room
 for 6000 in the stands and on the     
 first day of racing acrowd of 14000   
 watched the 6 races.The company was   
 dissolved in 1895 the reason being    
 that too few punters turned up to     
 watch.                                
 In 1909 Gustav Hemel flew into the    
 Hedon airfield and thus culminated    
 years of hard work in getting the idea
 of the airfield accepted.Again abright
 idea was not accepted largely because 
 there was insufficint commercial      
 traffic to make the venture viable.   </content>
