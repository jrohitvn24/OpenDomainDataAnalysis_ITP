		<title>17A Child's Day at School.</title>
		<content>   I and my sister walk the mile to    
 school,taking a short cut through the 
 new estate. We arrive at 8.50 a.m. and
 meet our friends in the playground.   
 After registration at 9.00 a.m. each  
 class enters the hall for an assembly.
   We usually spend the morning doing  
 mathematics work, which may include   
 the four rules of number, fractions,  
 geometry and lots of other topics. We 
 also do English, reading, vocabulary, 
 spelling and written work.            
   The afternoons can be spent on      
 science, geography or history when we 
 sometimes watch a television program. 
 We then may do art, craft, needlework,
 cooking, music or games.              
   During the afternoon and morning    
 sessions we have a playtime.We can    
 eat a lunch prepared by the kitchen,  
 bring a packed lunch or go home.At    
 3.30 p.m. I return home on the bus.   </content>
