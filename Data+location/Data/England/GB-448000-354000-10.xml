		<title>10Our Street.  A poem</title>
		<content> Our street is alright                 
 But there is a woman                  
 Who's as mad as a monkey              
    Nobody likes her because           
 She says things like                  
 "It couldn't happen here this is      
                             England." 
 People are frightened of her          
 Because she doesn't act the same      
 Since her mam and dad died.           
    She went into Woolworth's on       
                              Saturday 
 And tried to buy things with          
                          bottle tops  
 But I don't know what they did with   
                                  her. 
 She wears her son's trousers          
 With a teatowel round                 
 On a summer's day she wears a fur     
 coat.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
