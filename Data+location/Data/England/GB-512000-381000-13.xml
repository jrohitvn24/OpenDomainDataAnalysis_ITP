		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content>    One farm in the block is 360 acres.
  It has 60 acres of permanent grazing 
 which is let to another farmer in the 
 summer, and the rest of the farm is   
 arable. Crops grown in 1985 were      
 winter wheat, oil-seed rape, sugar    
 beet, barley, and a small acreage of  
 oats grown for seed. Late summer and  
 autumn is the busiest part of the     
 year. Barley and rape are harvested   
 from late July, then wheat. Harvesting
 will begin as soon as the dew has     
 dried in the morning, and continue    
 until dusk. Fields are ploughed soon  
 after they are harvested,as the clay  
 soil is usually at its driest at this 
 time,and suffers less from compacting 
 by heavy machinery.Sugar beet is      
 lifted from late September until      
 Christmas. There is then a lull until 
 the weather is open enough for spring 
 sowing.                               </content>
