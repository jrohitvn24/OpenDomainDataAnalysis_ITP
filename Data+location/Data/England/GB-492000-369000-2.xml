		<content> In squares 9269,9369 and 9370 is a    
 modern housing estate which is{mainly 
{council owned},but with expensive     
 private estates in square 9370,east of
 Skellingthorpe road.Birchwood is laid 
 out along New Town designs with a     
 large central area of shops,services  
 and leisure facilities.The roads are  
 designed to{separate fast traffic}from
 the pedestrian.The housing is designed
 in an informal geometric way with     
 closes and cul-de-sacs.A variety of   
 brick colour is used in a mixture of  
 housing styles -{small terraces,      
{semi-detached,maisonettes in low rise 
{blocks.}The main area of Birchwood is 
 council owned but some people have    
 bought their houses from the council. 
 Some streets are well maintained but  
 others are not because of broken      
 windows and fences.This new area is   
 beginning to look shabby already.     </content>
