		<title>14East Street Scheme, Bristol</title>
		<content> East Street shopping centre contains  
 about 100 shops, banks, public houses 
 and other businesses, but no large    
 retail shop.  However the roads are   
 very busy and pedestrians frequently  
 have to walk in the streets.  A lot of
 people shop in East Street,           
 especially the old people who cannot  
 get to the hypermarkets on the        
 outskirts of the city.  People find   
 car parking difficult.  The top class 
 in Holy Cross school invited Mr.      
 Blackburn from the Planning Office to 
 come and discuss the scheme.  One     
 thing the children were concerned with
 was the fact that rounders balls would
 hit the cars in the proposed car      
 park next to the school's playing     
 field.  The children thought that     
 having Asda (a hypermarket) built on  
 the Imperial Factory Site has its good
 and bad points.                       </content>
