		<content> Mr Paul Drayton is the chairmain of   
 Sandown{CARNIVAL}Committee.  He has   
 worked at the carnival for nine years.
  The main carnival is at the end of   
 July and is the biggest{EVENT}of the  
 year.  It lasts for 1 hour.  The      
 illuminations are at the end of       
 August.  The day before the carnival  
 is the childrens fancy dress parade.  
 Last year we collected Â£400 from the  
 parade.  To make a float we work for  
 three months.  We could spend a whole 
 week doing it instead.  We have had   
 Sandown Carnival for 35 years.  There 
 are about 30 floats.  It costs about  
 Â£250 to decorate floats with flowers, 
 lighting and decoration.  We crown a  
 carnival queen and we have a Mr       
 Universe competition and a grandmother
 competition.  Last year we had a      
{BARBEQUE}with a steel band on the     
 beach.                                </content>
