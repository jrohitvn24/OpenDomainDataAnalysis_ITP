		<title>18ECOLOGY/OPEN LAND</title>
		<content> The area,although heavily residential,
 has open land which is accessible     
 to the public.For{recreation},there   
 are small playing fields and open     
 grassland.This includes{Freemantle    
{Common}near Bitterne and a large      
 playing field for sports situated in  
 Hightown.There are no big country     
 parks(although two are within easy    
 reach by car)but there are some small 
 pieces of land for the public's needs.
{Miller's Pond} is a natural wetland   
 area in Sholing which may eventually  
 suffer residential development but    
 local people have produced a petition 
 against this.The council have just    
 made footpaths through the Miller's   
 Pond area.The recent landscape work   
 around the {Bitterne Bypass}has done  
 much to enhance the area known locally
 as "Hum Hole".
