		<content> Half the children brought packed      
 lunches, a few went home, the rest    
 ate school lunches. They liked fish   
 fingers and ham salad, but disliked   
 swede, mashed potatoes and mushy peas!
 Pocket money ranged from 25p to Â£1 per
 week, and most had to do jobs at home.
 Some read their parents' newspapers,  
 from The Times to The Star, and had   
 wide interests in books.  Two pupils  
 only did not have television - one did
 not like it. The majority went to     
 Church and four sang in a Church      
 choir. Some go abroad for the holidays
 but most holiday in Britain.  Their   
 ambitions when they grew up were very 
 varied.  Several wanted to join the   
 Police, some go into professional     
 sports, one into acting, a Chef, a    
 Magician &amp; an artist.  One girl wanted
 to join the Navy and she also wanted  
 to sail round the world.              </content>
