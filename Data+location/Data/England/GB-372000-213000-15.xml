		<title>15Characteristics of the River</title>
		<content> The Severn here is not a river to be  
 treated lightly:the currents are      
 strong and its undertows notorious    
 having claimed many lives of          
 swimmers,capsized boatmen and walkers 
 on the sandbanks which appear at low  
 tide but which are quickly engulfed by
 rising tides.Deep mud,areas of sinking
 sand and changing contours of the     
 river bed all add to its dangers      
 but,respected and understood,it can   
 give boatsmen and walkers pleasure and
 profit.Swimming is never advised.In   
 recent memory the river has frozen    
 over,enabling people to walk across it
 but this is very rare.It has also,in  
 very dry summers,dropped to such a low
 level that people with a sound        
 knowledge of the river bed have been  
 able to walk across to the other bank 
 but visitors and less knowledgeable   
 people are ill-advised to try this.   </content>
