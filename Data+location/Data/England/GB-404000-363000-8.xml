		<content>                                       
     The house that I did a survey on  
was called Hole Carr Farm.  The land   
at this farm is mostly rough pasture   
which is used for sheep grazing.  The  
people put the sheep on the rough      
pasture because sheep will eat almost  
anything.  For example they will eat   
rushes, heather and maybe even gorse   
and thorns.  Some of the land is also  
used for meadow and normal pasture.    
     Round this farm there isn't any   
woodland.                              
     The people who live at the farm   
have lots of dogs which seem nasty.    
     At this farm they only have mains 
electricity.  They also have their own 
transport.                             
     Seven people live at the house -  
2 adults and 5 children.
