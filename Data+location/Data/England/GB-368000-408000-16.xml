		<title>16CROAL COTTON MILL</title>
		<content>  Mrs C*** came to our school for an   
 interview about Croal Mill.We asked   
 her some questions about Croal Mill.  
 Mrs C*** worked at Croal Mill for     
 seven years and she retired because of
 sickness. Croal Mill has got five     
 floors, also it has got a canteen on  
 the third floor. Mrs C*** worked at a 
 desk, she enjoyed it. She said the    
 mill was very clean.                  
     The mill has been operational for 
 about 60 years. Croal Mill produced   
 Long-John's and shirts for the navy.  
 Mrs C***'s uncle used to work at Croal
 Mill. They did not wear shoes because 
 the floors were so clean and polished 
 but they used to get spinters in their
 feet. Mrs ***'s uncle used to work on 
 a cotton machine that stretched very  
 thin cotton and wound it up into a    
 roll.                                 
                                       </content>
