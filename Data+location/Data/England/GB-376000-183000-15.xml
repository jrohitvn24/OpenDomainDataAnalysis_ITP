		<title>15FOOTPATHS AROUND HORTON</title>
		<content>   Horton is a very pretty place.There 
 are lots of footpaths which hikers    
 use. The  Cotswold Way is a popular   
 footpath which leads from Bath to     
 Chipping Campden. Sometimes the hikers
 stay in hotels but sometimes they     
 camp. Today we went for a walk up part
 of the Cotswold Way.We talked about   
 how well you could see the footpath   
 because it had been mown .When we     
 walked along another path the farmer  
 did not keep it clear. When we went   
 for a different walk we went through a
 field that had poles in it marking    
 where people should walk .One farmer  
 had padlocked his gates because people
 walk through and forget to shut       
 them.This makes the farmer cross      
 because cows from one field could get 
 into another and ruin his crops.Some  
 farmers put stiles so that you don't  
 have to climb over the gates.         </content>
