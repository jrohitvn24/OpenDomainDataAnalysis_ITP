		<content> An interview with Lord Coleridge at   
 Chanter House:                        
                                       
 Three girls and two boys went to      
 Chanters House to interview Lord      
 Coleridge. When they got there they   
 found Lord Coleridge in the kitchen.  
 He took them down to the cellar and   
 told them about a secret passage which
 led to Cadhay and the church but has  
 now been bricked up. Lord Coleridge   
 took them upstairs and they came to a 
 door which had Cromwell and Fairfast  
 engraved on it. They went inside and  
 saw a large table and on the beams    
 around the room were painted          
 small pictures.                       
 The children began to interview Lord  
 Coleridge. They learned that the title
 was first given to the Colridge family
 in 1873 when a member of the family   
 was made Lord Chief Justice of England</content>
