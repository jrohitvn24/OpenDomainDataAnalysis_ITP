		<content> One of the local pubs in Worle is the 
 Woodspring.The times they open are    
 10:45am until 2:30pm then from 6:00pm 
 to 11:00pm.The busiest time of the    
 day is lunch time.The quietest time of
 the day is opening time.People like to
 eat out more nowadays.Most peoples'   
 favourite drink is beer;the least     
 favourite drink is Dark Rum.People    
 don't go as often as they used to and 
 when they do they like to eat out in  
 nice surroundings.Most people nowadays
 like to play skittles,darts,card games
 and dominoes rather than electronic   
 games.Men go alone more and they spend
 the most money on pay day.The landlord
 and landlady work 10+hours a day 7    
 days a week.They have lived at this   
 pub for 10 years and have noticed the 
 village has expanded to almost a      
 small town.
