		<title>10MOUNT ST JOHN, FELIXKIRK.</title>
		<content>  Mount St John-so named because of its
 use as a hospital by the order of the 
 knights of St John of Jerusalmem in   
 the time of Henry the first. Further  
 details to be found in 'Buildings of  
 England' by Nikolaus Pevsner, is now  
 the home of the Lord of the Manor. The
 estate covers about 1250 acres, around
 600 acres are to let tenant farmers   
 and the rest, 650 acres are farmed    
 here with the help of a manager and 5 
 staff. Approximately 150 acres of this
 are covered with deciduous trees and  
 the remainder is grassland.           
  This is used for intensive sheep     
 farming. A few pigs, sucklers and     
 hunters are also kept. Artificial     
 fertiliser and a small amount of      
 herbicide is used on the land.
