		<title>04RELIGION, EAST BARKWITH</title>
		<content>    The religious buildings in the area
 are all Christian.{St. Mary's}church  
{East Barkwith}was originally          
 Perpendicular in style, but underwent 
 considerable restoration in the nine- 
 teenth century. The pillars of the    
 south aisle are obviously older than  
 those on the north aisle. The font is 
 octagonal,with carvings of heads and  
 the instruments of the passion. The   
 pulpit is metal, embossed with a      
 pattern of grape vines.{St.Martin's}  
 church,{South Willingham,}contains    
 traces of thirteenth century work, but
 was also greatly restored in the      
 nineteenth century. There is a squint,
 from the demolished north arcade, and 
 a rood screen across the chancel arch.
 The reredos is of carved wood, with   
 emblems of Matthew, Mark, Luke and    
 John.
