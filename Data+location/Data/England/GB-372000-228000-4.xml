		<content>{Pauntley C.E. Primary School}(grid ref
 37312292) stands on the old Parish    
 Boundary, marked by the old{Boundary  
{Oak tree,}in the hamlet of Pool Hill. 
 It is a tiny two-roomed Victorian     
 building to which has been added a    
 small kitchen, which doubles as an    
 office, and a separate toilet block.  
                                       
 Approximately ten years ago the school
 was threatened with{closure}when pupil
 numbers fell to 16.  Public opinion   
 changed Gloucestershire Education     
 Committee's decision. Now there are 38
 pupils. Under present policy there is 
 no threat but with continual changes  
 in Governments and policies nothing is
 certain.                              
                                       
 Pupils come from a wide area, not just
 Pauntley Parish.
