		<title>06    Holiday Makers</title>
		<content>   We decided to find out what sort of 
 people come on holiday to Weston-super
 -Mare.We went down to the sea front   
 and asked ten people who were on      
 holiday to answer our questions.      
   We found that people come to Weston 
 from all over Britain. Three people   
 came from{Birmingham.}The rest came   
 from{Wales, London, Halifax, Stow,    
{Coventry and Woking in Surrey.}People 
 probably come here from Birmingham    
 because it is the nearest sea-side    
 town and they can use the{M5.         
   Most people travelled by car        
 although some came by train or coach. 
 People seem to stay for either one or 
 two weeks.                            
   While people are staying here they  
 visit many of the tourist attractions.
 They visit the piers, parks, Breandown
 and the museum.                       
   Although Weston is a sea-side resort</content>
