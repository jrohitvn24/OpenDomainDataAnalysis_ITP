		<content> The train brige was built by a company
 called Horsely and Co. it was built in
 1908.Trains from Richmond and         
 Middlesex run over it so it is used a 
 lot.Quite recently  it was repaired.  
 The trains are so heavy it had to be  
 strengthened.                         
 The  river used to be much more       
 important because it was safer and    
 quicker. Kings and Queens used to     
 travel on it to Richmond Palace and   
 Hampton Court.
