		<content> Television is much more important to  
 our families than radio. Every family 
 in our school has a television, more  
 than half have two, about a quarter   
 have one, and a quarter have more than
 two.Most people watch daily for       
 between 3 and 5 hours.Many watch for  
 over 5 hours. We do not think they    
 would have time for many other        
 interests. Only a few families who    
 must choose programmes carefully wach 
 less than 2 hours.Adults and children 
 watch about the same amount. Children 
 watch earlier but adults stay up      
 later.About three quarters of our     
 families have a video recorder and    
 nearly half have a home computer. The 
 children like to play games like      
 "Space Invaders",so do their parents! 
 Reading is enjoyed by all the ages and
 many people visit the library         
 frequently.                           </content>
