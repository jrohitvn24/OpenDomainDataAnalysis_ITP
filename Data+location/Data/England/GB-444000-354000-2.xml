{1.}We were told by Derbyshire County  
 Council that the Growth Zone came to  
 our area because of the M1.A Growth   
 Zone is an area which the Government  
 decides to help by making it easy and 
 cheap for companies to build factories

 motorway opened.There are 5 industrial
 estates:Wharf Road,Pinxton;Brookhill, 
 Pinxton;Rough Close,S.Normanton;

 engineering.Other main industries     
 include:electrical,plastics,textiles, 
 furniture and transport.
