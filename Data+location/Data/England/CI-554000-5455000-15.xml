		<title>15Policing in St.Ouen.</title>
		<content>   St Ouen's is a country parish and as
 such does not have the volume of crime
 found in other more populated areas in
 the island.  However, nowhere is far  
 away from anywhere in the Jersey of   
 today and the motor car and motor     
 cycle mean that the parish is         
 travelled and visited by many people  
 particularly in the summer months.    
 Vandalism is fairly common as is car  
 "borrowing".  Drunken driving is a    
 real menace.                          
                                       
   Patrol cars are Fords and Vauxhalls 
 while the motor cycles are BMWs.
