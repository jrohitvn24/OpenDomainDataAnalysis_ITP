		<content>{ Natland Mill Beck Farm}is at least   
 308 years old and possibly older says 
 Mrs. Gardner, the owner. The farm has 
 been in the family thirty-two years.  
 It covers 167 acres but some of the   
 land is situated elsewhere. There are 
 about eighty-five{cows}including      
 sterks and heifers. They are mainly   
{Friesian,}although some{Holsteins}have
 been introduced. These dairy cows each
 give about 27.5 litres of{milk}a day, 
 or up to 45 litres in lactation. The  
 milk goes to Dairy Crest and the Milk 
 Marketing Board to be bottled or made 
 into{yoghurt, butter, cheese or       
{skimmed milk.                         
  There are four{tractors}and a{plough 
 among the twenty-four items in use on 
 the farm. Natland Mill Beck Farm      
 produces its own silage and uses      
 approximately 110 tons of feed cake a 
 year.                                 </content>
