  brick building.The cells where the   
  Pilgrim fathers were once imprisoned 
 still remain.After the guilds were    
 abolished, the hall was used as the   
 towns hall, and the chief place of    
 civic entertainment for more than 300 
 years.Today it is a museum of history 
 costing about 30p to get in.Below the 
 stairs,is the most interesting feature
 is an old kitchen and fireplace with  
 spits for large scale roasting and the
 which the Pilgrim fathers were        
 imprisoned after attempting to leave  
 England.

 Long ago there was a group of puritans
 who were going to sail to North       
 America in a ship called              
 the"Mayflower."They were captured     
 going down the Haven and were         
 imprisoned in the Guildhall at Boston.</content>
