		<content> I live at 31 Warren Park, Hove        
 Edge.When I leave my house I meet     
 Tracey and Kimberley.We walk down my  
 drive and turn right, then walk along 
 Warren Park, passing 30 houses and a  
 football ground. The houses are made  
 of bricks. At the end we turn right   
 along Green Lane.We pass several      
 houses, some of which are made of     
 brick, and some of stone.             
 We cross over and turn left to walk up
 Spout House Lane, passing two houses, 
 one of which is made of stone,  the   
 other of brick. We also pass Scruples,
 the hairdressers, on the other side of
 the road. We then turn onto Upper     
 Green Lane,where our school is.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
