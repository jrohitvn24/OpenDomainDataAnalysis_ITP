		<title>12FARM VISIT - WASHINGTON</title>
		<content> Today we went to Havannah Farm with   
 Mr.Wilkinson and Mrs.Brewster. When we
 got there we met the farmer           
 Mr.Malpass.He took us into one of his 
 barns so we could talk to him. We     
 asked him lots of questions about the 
 farm and what he did on the farm and  
 if he enjoyed working there. He said  
 he enjoyed working on the farm very   
 much. After we had been talking to him
 about his work he took us outside to  
 show us his cows. He shouted a few    
 funny words and the cows came         
 galloping towards us. This we found   
 very amusing. After awhile the farmer 
 went back to the farmhouse to get a   
 few titti bottles to feed the calves. 
 Tracy,my friend, took some photographs
 of the cows and the farmer and so did 
 my teacher, Mr.Wilkinson.
