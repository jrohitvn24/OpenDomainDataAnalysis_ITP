 FARTHING COMMON is said by some to be 
 named so because it is so small that  
 it could never have been worth more   
 than a farthing to any commoner;others
 say its size is only the forth part,  
 four-thing, of any useful plot. It is 
 595ft above sea level on the Stone    
 Street Road to Canterbury and is now  
 a picnic area. Many people stop to    
 admire the views of the countryside.  
 Stone Street passes due north and     
 south through this area. It is the old
 roman road which leads from Port      
 Lympne to Canterbury and the junction 
 with Watling Street.
