		<content>    The school building consists of ten
rooms, of which 4 are everyday         
classrooms.   There are also - a hall, 
library, music room, staffroom,        
headteacher's office and entrance hall.
     There are many special events in  
the year, one of them being Speech Day 
when prizes are given and each class   
performs a play for the parents.  In   
Autumn there is a Harvest Festival     
service in church and afterwards the   
older children take baskets of fruit   
round the village to the older folk.   
     Another service is the founders'  
day service on St Thomas' day in       
December when the children take the    
complete service in church.            
     The children wear a school uniform
for girls a navy blue dress with white 
bouse and school tie: for boys grey    
trousers, grey shirt and school tie.
