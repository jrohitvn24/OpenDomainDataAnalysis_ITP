		<title>16SHEEP SHEARING</title>
		<content> I live on a{farm}near{Garforth.}There 
 is always much to do, like repairing  
 machinery or getting the fields ready.
 My father employs three men. We keep{ 
{sheep and cows.}We keep the cows for  
 their meat not their milk. The sheep  
 we use for{wool and meat.}When the    
 sheep are ready for{shearing}between  
 July and September we hire extra men, 
 who are expert shearers. They take    
 hold of the sheep and then with a     
 machine with a lot of cutting blades  
 the wool is cut off. When the wool,   
 the fleece, is removed it is rolled up
 and put into a bag. The sheep are then
 dipped into disinfected water to kill 
 off any bugs which remain on their    
 skin. This has to be done by{law.}
