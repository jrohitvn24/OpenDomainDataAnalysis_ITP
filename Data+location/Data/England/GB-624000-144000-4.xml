		<title>04A hedgerow near Lydden</title>
		<content>The road was bounded on either side by 
banks and well established hedgerows   
containing many species of trees       
including holly,field maple and hazel. 
There were also hawthorn,sycamore,ash  
and oak. There was a great deal of     
ivy covering the trees.The plants on   
 ome stretches of the banks were       
difficult to identify because they had 
been recently and ruthlessly cut back  
by a mechanical trimmer.Where the banks
had not received this treatment,many   
plants could be seen.Among them were   
red campion,herb robert,some           
vetches,bracken,stinging nettles,white 
dead nettle,common hempnettle and      
cleavers.We also saw cuckoo pint and a 
stand of hogweed.                      
We turned off the road into a rough    
track leading into Callow Wood.There   
were many wild strawberries on the     
banks here and some woody nightshade.  </content>
