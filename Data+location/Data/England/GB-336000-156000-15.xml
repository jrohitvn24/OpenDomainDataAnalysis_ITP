		<title>15Crook Peak</title>
		<content>     The actual summit of {Crook Peak  
{is}just to the south of the area, but 
 the vast majority of the top of this  
 Mendip hill comes within our area.    
 Crook Peak itself is in Somerset, but 
 Barton Hill, just to the north is in  
 Avon.                                 
     The National Trust are intending  
 to buy the land stretching from{Crook 
{Peak}to Shute Shelve in the east. Most
 people think that Crook Peak is the   
 highest Mendip Hill, but this honour  
 goes to Blackdown.{Crook Peak}is the  
 most significant landmark, however,   
 being very familiar to travellers to  
 and from the West Country, because it 
 is so close to the M5.                
     The deal has been agreed, but the 
 trust is to launch a Â£69,000 appeal to
 help pay for it.
