		<title>17TRANSPORT SERVICES</title>
		<content> Fifty years ago people had to walk to 
 work but today many travel by car.Just
 over 20 years ago there was a train   
 service from The Lea to either        
 Hereford or Gloucester.Then that line 
 was closed on condition that a        
 comparable bus service was provided.  
 Some rely on a bus service which      
 although subsidised by Councils has   
 had drastic action taken and whose    
 services have been reduced with a     
 continual change of routes resulting  
 in buses running nearly empty,very    
 infrequently and inconveniently e.g a 
 passenger by train from London would  
 arrive in Gloucester at 7.30 p.m.to   
 catch the bus for The Lea but would   
 find that the last bus for The Lea had
 left Gloucester at 6.30 p.m. An       
 increase in the bus fare is self-     
 defeating for less people use the     
 service which tends to make it shrink.</content>
