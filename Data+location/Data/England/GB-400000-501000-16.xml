		<title>16St.Mary's Church</title>
		<content> The original{Church}in Arkengarthdale 
 was close to the{Arkle beck}in{Arkle  
{Town.}It has entirely disappeared and 
 only gravestones remain. We know that 
 this church was given  to the monks of
 Egglestone Abbey before 1292.By 1812  
 the foundations of the church were    
 being undermined by the Arkle beck and
 it had become unsafe.                 
 The new church was built with money   
 from George Brown.It was erected      
 between the school and{Langthwaite}and
 consecrated in July 1820. The         
 congregation of 160 attended church   
 twice each Sunday.                    
 Today the{population}and therefore the
 congregation has diminished. At the   
 beginning of 1985 St.Mary's was       
 without a vicar but the new vicar (in 
 charge of 4 churches) arrived in April
 1985.Only 1 service now takes place   
 with a congregation of about 20.      </content>
