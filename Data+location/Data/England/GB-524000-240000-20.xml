		<title>20EVENTS AT THE ASHWELL SHOW</title>
		<content> Though absent this year vehicles have 
 been a feature of the show in the     
 past. The Vintage Car Association has 
 its national headquarters in Ashwell. 
 A microlight aircraft took off from   
 the field and periodically flew       
 overhead. The Offley and Bedford      
 Morris Dancers entertained the crowd  
 with a collection of Cotswold         
 handkerchief and stick dances.        
 Children were entertained with magic  
 and puppet shows. There were          
 also pony rides and a miniature       
 railway train and a giant inflateable 
 castle . One problem the organisers   
 found this year was the trouble of    
 clearing a larger than usual number of
 cow pats from the field. This was due 
 to the unusually wet summer!
