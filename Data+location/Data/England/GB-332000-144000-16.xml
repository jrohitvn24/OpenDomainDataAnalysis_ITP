		<content> We were surprised at the number of    
 active clubs in the village.There are 
 15 in total,ranging from Mother's     
 Union to Darts,from Ladies Keep Fit to
 Cricket.                              
         The Women's Institute is one  
 of the thriving organisations.It has  
 been going for more than ten years now
 and has more than twenty-five regular 
 members.The Institute have six        
 trophies of various kinds.They take   
 part in a local skittles league in    
 which they have won several trophies. 
                The Women's Institute  
 meet once a month at 7.30pm in the    
 Church Hall.There is a wide age range 
 present,but the activities are carried
 out together.
