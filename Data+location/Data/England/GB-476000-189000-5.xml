		<title>05The Villages - TURVILLE</title>
		<content>  TURVILLE is by far the most          
attractive, a typical English Village, 
about 45 homes around the church and   
circular village green. Most of these  
are old though there are a few post-war
council built houses. The Vicarage is  
modern. At the rear of the village is  
the derelict school closed in 1984. The
village is dominated by a ridge to the 
north on which stands a renovated wind-
mill Â£Cobstone Mill'. The name has been
variously recorded through the years - 
Thyreferld - Turfield -Â£a dry open     
field'. On the side of a barn is a war 
time plaque Â£Air Raid Warden's Post'.  
The 13th. century church is dedicated  
to St. Mary the Virgin, and is built of
flint.                                 
  Although many families in the        
district have their own horses, the    
Riding Stable is the centre of         
increasingly popular horse riding.     </content>
