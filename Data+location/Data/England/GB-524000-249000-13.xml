		<title>13PICK YOUR OWN FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content>     This farm lies where the boulder  
 clay has been well mixed with chalk   
 and sandy loam giving a light soil    
 ideal for fruit farming. Much is given
 over to apple and pear orchards and a 
 large variety of soft fruits is grown.
 It largely caters for the             
 'Pick-Your_Own' trade and although    
 fruit is available from the storage   
 facilities during the whole year, most
 of its trade is carried out between   
 June and October.
