		<title>03History Shenley &amp; Whaddon</title>
		<content> Shenley Toot is a field of sheep and  
 hummocky unexcavated earthworks. There
 is a moated site which may have been a
 Roman camp &amp; later a homestead.       
 Westbury farm is a moated homestead   
 with a large wooden door reputed to   
 have been made from a Portuguese ship.
 Nothing is left of Snellshall Priory  
 except earthworks.It fell into ruin   
 &amp; was dissolved in 1535.The remains   
 were used to build St Giles' church,  
 Tattenhoe.Whaddon or Wheathill/Whaddon
 though the huntsmen &amp; hounds now      
 gather in Winslow &amp; there are no      
 kennel kennels in Kennel Lane. Queen  
 Elizabeth honoured the country house  
 of Whaddon Hall with a visit. Spenser 
 composed'The Faery Queen' under an oak
 in its grounds. Cuttings from the     
 Glastonbury thorn are said to grow in 
 the churchyard at Whaddon &amp; in a field
 near St Mary's church Shenley.        </content>
