		<title>10   The Mistley Carnival</title>
		<content>    On Saturday it was the Mistley and 
 Manningtree{carnival.}We have a       
 carnival every year in Mistley        
 around the end of April. When         
 it came we walked along with it.      
    The{entertainment}was a cowboy     
{float}and some of the cowboys were    
 walking beside the float. They had    
 guns with caps in. They made an awful 
 noise. Then we saw the Mistley        
 carnival princess and{carnival queen. 
 We saw Great Bromley carnival queen   
 who came along to help. We saw the    
 Mistley hockey team and the men       
 majorettes. The Thursday Club did     
 a float called the captains table.    
    Then we went to the welcome home   
 field in Mistley where Mistley quay   
 won the tug of war. My dad was the    
 referee.
