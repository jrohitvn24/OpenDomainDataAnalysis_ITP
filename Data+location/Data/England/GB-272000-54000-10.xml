		<title>10A DAY AT DIPTFORD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> This is a typical day at school. I am 
 collected in the morning by the School
{Mini-Bus}at 8.5O. At 9 I go into the  
 playground after I am called in to do 
 my Fletcher after which I have a      
 School Assembly then a 15 minute      
 break. Then I complete my Fletcher and
 my project work. Swimming follows     
 until the end of the morning, then I  
 wait for my sitting to go for{lunch.}I
 have packed lunch in the Parish Hall. 
 After this I  have a five minute break
 followed by Art then another break.   
 Later I am called in to see Father    
 Peter the Rector. I then go home. The 
{School building}was built in 1863.    
 There are now 77 children in the      
 School and every year the 4th year    
 transfer to King Edward VI College in 
 Totnes.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
