		<title>11FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content>   There are 20 footpaths on the       
 present definitive map of this area. A
 number are due to be transferred from 
 their old routes to others, more      
 suitable for the landowners. Footpaths
 are a heritage from the days when the 
 only means of travel was horseback or 
 walking. Today they are protected by  
 the Parish Council, residents and the 
 Ramblers Association.                 
   The South Eastern side of{Bredon    
{Hill,}with wonderful views over the   
 vale of Evesham to the Lickeys in the 
 North, the Cotswolds in the East and  
 the Severn Valley to the South is very
 popular with walkers. The Wychavon Way
 passes through the parish and runs    
 along the Eastern ridge of the hill,  
 making use of old bridleways and the  
 footpath through the churchyard to the
 village street. It is marked with     
 yellow arrows and a stylised'W'symbol.</content>
