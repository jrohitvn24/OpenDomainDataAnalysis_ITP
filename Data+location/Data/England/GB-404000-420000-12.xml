		<title>12LOCAL HOUSING</title>
		<content> Homes on the ridges and along the     
 edges of the moor are clustered in    
 tiny groups. Houses have spread       
 upwards from the valley floor as new  
 homes have been built.                
                                       
 Many old{barns}and{farmhouses}have    
 been converted into fine houses, as   
 have the back-to-back{cottages}of the 
 mill workers from the 19th century.   
                                       
 New housing developments are being    
 built as the area gains in popularity.
 Since the older houses are built of   
 the local greyish{stone,}the new      
 houses are built to conform, but      
 frequently make use of reconstructed  
 stone.                                
                                       
{Roofs}are tiled in slate.
