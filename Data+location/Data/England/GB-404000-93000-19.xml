		<content>    Wallisdown Rd. is the busiest.     
 Juggernauts, lorries, buses, vans,    
 cars, motor-bikes and bicycles travel 
 along it from Poole to Bournemouth.   
 There aren't many major roads which   
 means lorries of all shapes and sizes 
 have to go along small roads to       
 deliver to the shops.                 
    A new road is now being built from 
 Alderney towards Ferndown, this will  
 affect Talbot Woods. This road will be
 called the Winton and Moordown Relief 
 Road.It will cost Â£5 million.         
    Frost damages road surfaces and    
 causes ruts and humps to appear and   
 the roads frequently need repairing.  
 Drivers need a road fund licence which
 costs Â£90 for a year and this money   
 should be used to repair roads.The    
 majority of the roads in the area are 
 residential roads and cars are parked 
 outside the houses.                   </content>
