		<content>   {Plough Sunday. } A plough is       
 carried into Church for morning       
 service and blessed.                  
   {Bell Ringing. } There are six      
 bells in the Church tower.  The       
 heaviest bell is the tenor weighing   
 three hundredweight.  The bells are   
 rung every Sunday for morning service.
 The{Old Year}is rung out with muffled 
 bells. Just before midnight the bells 
 are unmuffled and the tenor strikes   
 twelve times. Then the{New Year}is    
 rung in.  This Year 1985 has seen the 
 loss of two established members of the
 tower.   The{ringing team}now consists
 of three men and three women.   It is 
 difficult to persuade youngsters to   
 join.                                 
    {Harvest Supper. } Young and old   
 attend.   The supper is held in the   
 Village Hut.   Usually some form of   
 light entertainment is held.          </content>
