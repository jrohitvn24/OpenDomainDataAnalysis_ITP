		<content>    There are lots of different sports 
 facilities in the{West Bridgford}area.
 Most of the sports grounds are near   
 the{River Trent.}The two best known   
 are the{Nottingham Forest Football    
{Ground}and the{Trent Bridge County    
{Cricket Ground.}The Forest Ground is a
 big place with tall flood-lights that 
 light up the games of football in the 
 winter. The Trent Bridge Cricket      
 Ground is used for county games and   
 Test Matches.                         
    By the river there are boat houses 
 which belong to the rowing clubs.     
 There is also the Sports Ground of the
 Boots Company.                        
    As well as these special grounds   
 there are two large parks with        
 children's playgrounds where we can go
 on swings and slides and see-saws.    
 There is also a big field to play on.
