 In addition to providing sports       
 facilities, the Recreation Centre is  
 also involved in the Community which  
 means the two nearby housing estates  
 of Bierley and Holme Wood where the   
 vast majority of the Tong pupils live.
  One example of the first aim is the  
 Summer Playschool running during the  
 school holidays from 22nd July to l6th
 August from Mondays to Fridays.
