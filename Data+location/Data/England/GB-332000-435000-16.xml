Fleetwood has developed as a container 
port over the last few years and so the
amount of heavy traffic has increased  
dramatically. To ease this a road link 
to the M55 has been planned. It would  
come through our block and cross over  
the road from Staining. Many people    
think that it would cut the village in 
two. Against this it would increase    
safety in Thornton and Poulton.        
{Our New Vicar}                        
On Wed. 26th June 1985 the Rev. Martin 
Ernest Chancellor Joyce became the new 
vicar of Staining. A service was held  
at which the Institution was carried   
out by the Rt Rev David Stewart Cross  
MA Bishop of Blackburn, and the        
Induction by the Ven Kenneth Henry     
Gibbons BSc Archdeacon of Lancaster.   
Our school was represented by the      
Headteacher, Mr Geoffrey Bottomley BA. </content>
