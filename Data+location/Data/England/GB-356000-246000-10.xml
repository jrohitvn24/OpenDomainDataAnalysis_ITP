		<title>10Experimental Farm in Felton</title>
		<content> Rosemaund Farm was purchased by the   
 Government in 1949 for about Â£150 per 
 hectare.  In 1985 there are 176       
 hectares valued at Â£7000 per hectare. 
 There are 37 people living and working
 on the site.  Rosemaund researches the
 development of hops, ceeals, legumes, 
 grassland, beef, cattle and sheep.    
 New crops are tested for disease and  
 yields.  During the hop harvest in    
 September up to about 1960 some 1,000 
 men, women and children came to Felton
 Parish from South Wales and the West  
 MIdlands.  Rosemaund in 1985 was the  
 only farm that had migrant labour for 
 hops; 12 men came from South Wales.   
 Hop pickers usually stayed on for     
 cider fruit picking but there is now  
 only one small orchard in Felton.
