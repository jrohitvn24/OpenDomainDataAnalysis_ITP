		<content>                                       
   Transport in the area of MASHBURY   
is not well developed. There is no bus 
service, national or private. People   
have to walk to bus stops around       
Chignal Smealy or use their own        
transport.                             
   Around the centre of CHIGNAL SMEALY 
there is a bus service which runs four 
times weekly along a minor road to     
Chelmsford. A Eastern National bus     
service is to the south of the area    
along the A414. A school bus runs daily
along the road by Chignal Hall to the  
nearest school outside the area.       
   There is a private bus service to   
and from Chelmsford twice a week.      
   The roads around the area of Chignal
Smealy and Mashbury are all minor roads
their condition is variable.           
   Private cars are the most common    
form of transport.                     </content>
