		<title>20FELLDYKE CAR PARK LAMPLUGH</title>
		<content> The Felldyke car park was built in    
 1985 to allow access for the people   
 who go into the Cogra Moss and Blake  
 area. It is used by people who: have  
 day tickets for fishing, are going for
 walks, are riding with Kerbeck Ponies,
 are interested in the wild life to be 
 found. The car park means it is much  
 easier for the keen fishermen/women   
 and fell walkers and runners to get   
 close to an area where they want to   
 be. People who walk enjoy the fells   
 and forestry. When walking they wear  
 strong shoes or boots and clothing    
 suitable for the weather. If they are 
 going out for quite a while they take 
 a rucksack. The fells are open land,  
 there are a few footpaths and sheep   
 trods. Since the car park has been    
 opened it has often been full.
