       The land is regarded as "heavy  
 agricultural land". Much of the area  
 is clay based and the dyke system is  
 an essential part of the drainage     
 system.                               
       Water drains from the dyke      
 system at the Humber when the tide is 
 low. Natural drainage is impossible at
 high tide which results in flood      
 possibilities. A system of locks is   
 used to control the dyke flow and     
 there are a number of pumping stations
 at critical points. These are not     
 sufficient at certain times and       
 flooding takes place. Farmers often   
 allow poor sections of land to be     
 flooded to protect crops. Urban areas 
 are rarely flooded.
