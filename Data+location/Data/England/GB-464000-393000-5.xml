		<title>05The Crown Hotel, Bawtry</title>
		<content>  The Crown Hotel is a white building  
 with black woodwork which stands in   
 Bawtry Market Square.An arch on the   
 right leads to the sleeping           
 accommodation and bars.The kitchens   
 also open onto this long,narrow court-
 yard.There is a car park at the back  
 of the hotel and behind the bedrooms  
 can be seen remains of the stables.   
  The ballroom is known as the Hogarth 
 Room and its walls are lined with     
 amusing and serious Victorian         
 pictures.Beautiful chandeliers hang   
 from the ceiling.                     
  A door from this room leads to a     
 small ,pretty garden.There are big    
 wooden benches and an island flower   
 bed.It is enclosed by a wall and is   
 quiet and private.The Crown Hotel was 
 once a Posting House and has          
 associations with Robin Hood and Dick 
 Turpin.                               </content>
