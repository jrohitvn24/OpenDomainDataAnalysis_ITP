		<title>10BRIGHTON CROSS</title>
		<content>    This little settlement is at the   
 cross roads of the A39 and the main   
 road from Newquay to St Austell. Over 
 the years many accidents have happened
 here and the crossing has been        
 continuously improved.                
 There is a garage here and across the 
 road a recently opened cafe. At the   
 cafe there is a park for lorries in   
 which most lorry drivers sleep in     
 their cabs over night or they may stay
 in a room at the rear of the cafe     
 where there are toilets, showers and a
 television room. The cafe is open for 
 meals all day, the most populuar being
 mixed grills.In the summer the cafe is
 open longer because of holidaymakers. 
 Outside the cafe there is a breakdown 
 service because there are many crashes
 on the cross road.Petrol and diesel   
 are available as is a telephone.
