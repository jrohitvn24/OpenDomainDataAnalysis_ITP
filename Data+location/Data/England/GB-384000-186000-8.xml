		<title>08NW WILTSHIRE LOCAL PLAN</title>
		<content>    The recent proposals for Sherston  
 in the next ten years outlined in the 
 NW. Wiltshire local plan have proved  
 to be rather{controversial.}The       
 proposals are to build houses on land 
 adjacent to Manor Close which had been
 thought of as the new school site.This
 would now be moved to the W.of Knock_ 
 down Rd. on the opposite corner to    
 Green Lane.Houses would be built upon 
 the present allotment site between    
 Green Lane &amp; Manor Close.             
    At a{public meeting}held in July   
 1985 some villagers expressed opposit_
 ion to the extent of the housing      
 development (50 houses) &amp; the dangers 
 for children in siting a future school
 near crossroads.Some were{apprehensive
 about the impact on the village of    
 such a{large influx of people.}The    
 Parish Council was to outline these   
 objections to the planning authority. </content>
