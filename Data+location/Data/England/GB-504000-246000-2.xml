		<content> The two railways into the town        
 crossed the block and attracted a     
 number of industrial companies to     
 build factories with sidings on to the
 main lines. Most of these factory     
 premises are still in existence       
 although their reliance on the railway
 is very small nowadays.               
                                       
 The development along Elstow Road was 
 later, most being in the 1930's but   
 again there were industrial premises  
 with connections with the railway.    
                                       
 The majority of industrial work in the
 area is light engineering although    
 there is a chocolate factory owned by 
 Tobler Suchard.
