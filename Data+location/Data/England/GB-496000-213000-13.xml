		<content>   The Sports Club was created from the
 football and cricket clubs on 1.10.75.
 The fore_runner of the Committee was  
 the Pavilion Project Committee and the
 money was raised by villagers with    
 grants from the Parish and County     
 Councils.  The Pavilion opened on 26th
 May 1975.  Generally each section     
 holds an annual dinner and            
 presentation evening as well as       
 various fund raising events such as   
 Jumble sales and discos.  The club    
 puts great effort in coaching         
 youngsters in cricket and tennis and  
 in the past, football.  The club's    
 colours are bright blue and gold.     
   The following belong to the Sports  
 Club _ Tennis, Bowls, Cricket,        
 Badminton, Football and Squash.  Each 
 household pays Â£2 a year subscription 
 as well as playing fees for each
