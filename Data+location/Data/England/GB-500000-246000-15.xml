		<title>15KEMPSTON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> The estate used to be called the      
{Chantry Road Estate}but was{renamed   
 the{Woburn Road Estate}as the area    
 has been expanded and developed with  
 the opening of the Kempston bypass,   
 allowing better access to the area.The
 newer part of the estate is made up of
 both small and large factory units. As
 many of the{workforce live outside the
{area}many factories have a carpark on 
 the premises. Some of the factories   
{make goods from raw materials,}others 
{assemble parts}which arrive from      
 elsewhere and some are used as        
{warehouses.}The newer factories have  
 landscaped their surroundings. The    
{products made on the estate}vary from 
 communication cables, etching         
 materials, micro-chip electronic      
 tills, industrial models, to the old  
 type of industry like ball_bearings   
 and welding equipment.                </content>
