		<content>  All levels of schooling are          
 represented here, reflecting the fact 
 that the community has a well         
 distributed age structure.            
 The Infants school is a product of the
 early 1970's and has a roll of 231.It 
 caters for the rising fives to seven  
 year olds.Because of the nature of its
 setting it tends to have a continuous 
 attendance in families.               
 The Junior school is housed in two    
 blocks built in 1907 and 1927 and     
 caters for the seven to eleven year   
 olds.Due to the fall in school rolls  
 in the 1970's, it has spare classrooms
 which are used for specialist teaching
 and it also retains long standing     
 family links within the village.      
 The John Penrose Senior school was    
 opened in 1954 and provides the rest  
 of the schooling for the community.
