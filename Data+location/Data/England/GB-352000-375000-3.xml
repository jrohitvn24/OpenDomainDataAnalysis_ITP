		<content>  The cows are milked again at 16.00h  
 and are so well conditioned that they 
 enter the parlour on hearing the      
 radio! The milk yield per cow per day 
 is 4 to 10 gallons. A veterinary      
 surgeon calls twice a month. The      
 busiest time is May 18 to June 15 when
 grass is collected and pickled in its 
 own lactic acid. The 1200 tons of     
 silage so formed is stored for winter 
 fodder. A 6 volt electric fence       
 regulates the cows' grazing. Anually  
 the cattle are branded by a 'cold     
 burn' from liquid nitrogen on the     
 buttock. So each cow carries its own  
 identity number as well as the farm's,
 in this case X1891,inside its ear.    
 Manure is spread on the fields as     
 fertilizer but the farmer would like  
 to see research into better use of its
 valuable nutrients.
