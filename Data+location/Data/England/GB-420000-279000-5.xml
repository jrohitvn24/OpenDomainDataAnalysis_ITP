		<title>05The Gravel Pits, Hampton</title>
		<content>   The{Gravel Pits}are situated next to
 the River Blythe down Marsh Lane. Some
 people, like myself, went swimming    
 there until a sign was put up saying, 
 "No persons are allowed to use these  
 premises without special permission". 
 Many people like walking around the   
 lakes, as this is allowed. There are  
 two{lakes}which both have islands. The
 one nearer to the road is the smaller 
 and deeper of the two. The pits were  
 dug out by Martin Conelly Contractors.
 It took twelve men three to four years
 to finish digging out all the gravel. 
 The lakes cover thirty acres and the  
 gravel which they dug out weighed     
 thousands of tonnes.                  
   There are some working{sand}and     
{gravel}pits along Cornets End Lane.   
 These have expanded rapidly over the  
 last few years and now occupy a very  
 large area of land.                   </content>
