		<content> Markets are held on Tuesdays and      
 Saturdays in the Town Centre and      
 Silver Street.Until recently a Butter 
 market was held on the ground floor of
 the Town Hall.A new Market Hall has   
 been opened next to the bus station.  
 The ground floor of the Town Hall has 
 been redesigned and changed into      
 shops.In our survey,the Market traders
 said that they came from Nottingham,  
 Leeds,Doncaster,Lincoln and Rotherham.

 following items being sold:-Fruit and 
 vegetables                            
 ,clothing,material,linen,tools,basket-
 ware,plants,socks,toiletries,shoes,   
 crockery and antiques.
