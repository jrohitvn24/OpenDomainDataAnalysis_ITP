		<title>19     ASKERN SPA</title>
		<content> During the {18th}century, Askern      
 became famous as a {spa town}.Natural 
 springs brought water into the lake   
 and lakeside area. This water was by  
 all accounts, very smelly. It         
 contained a good deal of sulphur, but 
 it was supposed to be good for the    
 health. Bath houses were built around 
 the lake so that people could take the
 waters and Doctors often prescribed a 
 drink of the water as a care for chest
 complaints. A special railway line was
 laid to bring vistors to Askern and   
 miners from surrounding pit villages  
 were sent to Askern to  recuperate.At 
 one time Askern was thought to rival  
 Harrogate or Bath as a spa town but   
 with the sinking of the coal mine in {
{1911},industry took over,and the spa  
 died a natural death.
