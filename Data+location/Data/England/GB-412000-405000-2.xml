 Our school is called{Hinchliffe Mill  
{Primary School}or Dobb Top School.    
 There was a school called{Holmbridge  
{C of E School.}There were only 19     
 pupils in the school when it closed   
 down because the roof wasn't safe.When
 the school closed down in 1984 the    
 children came to Hinchliffe Mill      
 School.James Keddy used to go to      
 Holmbridge C of E school and he said  
 "Sometimes I prefer my old school     
 but sometimes I prefer my new         
 school"                               
  We have 70 children in our school and
 we are split into 4 classes.          
  Holmbridge School building is for    
 sale. The church want Â£25,000 for it.
