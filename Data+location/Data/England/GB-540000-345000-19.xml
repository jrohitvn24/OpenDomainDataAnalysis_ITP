		<title>19Population of Leverton</title>
		<content> Leverton and its surroundings are not 
 classed as a development area         
 consequently not much building has    
 taken place in the last twenty years. 
 The population has remained at about  
 six hundred for the past several      
 hundred years.Young people tend to    
 move away from the area in order to   
 find work and seem no longer to marry 
 within their own community.Older      
 people are moving into the area to    
 retire because in comparison with     
 other parts of the country it is a    
 very cheap place to live.Housing is   
 generally not as expensive and people 
 have ready access to fresh vegetables 
 and are within easy reach of several  
 large cities and the coast.
