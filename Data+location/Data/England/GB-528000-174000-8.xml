When I am going to have my hair washed,
I fill my bucket of water up to the    
rim. Then I call my mum to wash my hair
I have to bend over the top of the bath
and wait until my mum to come and put  
the water upon my hair. It takes a     
short time for my mum to do that. I    
closed my eyes so that the water       
doesn't go in my eyes. I like it when  
my mum puts the shampoo on.  Then my   
back starts to ache, and then I call   
out to my mum and say that my back is  
aching. And she would say that I must  
move forward then, and so I would. Then
she puts in the conditioner. I put a   
towel round my neck and she starts to  
rub.                                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
