		<title>02Local History W. Grove</title>
		<content> The name of Grove is thought to come  
 from Thomas Grove, landowner of the   
 early seventeenth century.  W. Grove  
 is almost entirely a mid twentieth    
 century development, but there are a  
 few historical factors directly       
 affecting life in 1985.  The G.W.R.,  
 built by Brunel, opened in August     
 1840. Today, Inter City trains pass   
 through, capable of travelling at 125 
 m.p.h. at the rate of 44 a day.  There
 are two railway bridges in the area.  
 Through the southern edge also passed 
 The Wilts. and Berkshire Canal, 1809  
 to 1914, now used as a footpath for   
 walkers.  From the air the ridge and  
 furrow strip fields of Mediaeval times
 are still clearly visible. When       
 enclosure came Grove became 3 farms,  
 Grove Ham, Picked Mead and Barwell. W.
 Grove is built on a 1939-45 World War 
 airfield.{                            </content>
