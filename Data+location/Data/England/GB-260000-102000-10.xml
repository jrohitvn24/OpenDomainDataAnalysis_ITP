		<title>10Dialect in the Exbourne area</title>
		<content> Although there are many new families  
 from elsewhere in the village of      
 Exbourne,there are still several      
 families who can trace back their     
 ancestors locally. We hear them speak 
 as follows:"Ers a gude lill maid-'erv 
 aited up aul er dinner."She's a good  
 little girl,she has eaten up all her  
 dinner."                              
  "Us is gwain awm" "We are going home"
  "Don ee put thicky things in thur,   
 ee'l get squarsht"."Don't put those   
 things in there, they will get        
 squashed."                            
   Old farmer about new fangled        
 ways"Tis all mechanism,t'aint no      
 natur,now." "It is all mechanized,    
 there's nothing natural." That's what 
 we think he meant!                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
