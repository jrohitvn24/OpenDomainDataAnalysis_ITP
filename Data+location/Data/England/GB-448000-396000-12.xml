		<content> The castle is an important part of    
 Conisbrough. It has not changed much  
 nor has the church. Across from Donna 
 Maries there is a library being built.
 Before that it was a square field that
 had been old Morley Place junior      
 school. The new school was built on   
 Ivanhoe Park. It is still called      
 Morley Place junior school, though it 
 is an new{building}it is an old       
 school. The roads are made for buses, 
 cars, vans and lorries. Some roads are
 not for lorries or buses over a       
 certain height. There is a low bridge 
 that the buses can't get underneath.  
 The land in our area is quite hilly.  
 Natural{woodland}has been replaced by 
 new housing estates. The{environment  
 has a few small factories, service    
 industries, and a colliery two miles  
 away.
