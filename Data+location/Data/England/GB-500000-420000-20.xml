{                                      
 The building is approx. 100 years old 
 and has been owned by 4 companies.    
 It started as a farming company and in
 the 1960's it was taken over by ACC.  
 In 1965 it was taken over by a firm   
 called Albright &amp; Wilsons and then in 
 1983 by ICI.                          
 The most dangerous chemical they use  
 is liquid ammonia. It has to be kept  
 in a cool container. If it escapes    
 anybody in it's path will find it hard
 to breathe.                           
 Safety procedures at the factory      
 include having their own fire         
 brigade,first aid centre and ammonia  
 incident teams.
