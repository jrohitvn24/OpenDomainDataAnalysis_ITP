		<content>  There is evidence of{stone_age}tribes
 within the area as{flint axes}have    
 been found,together with unnatural    
 mounds which although they have not   
 been fully investigated are probably  
{tumuli.                               
  Also signs of an earth{fort}exist    
 which could be from the{Stone}or      
{Bronze age.                           
  Pieces of{Roman pottery}have been    
 uncovered together with{oyster shells 
 and{coins.Oysters}were eaten by the   
{Legionaries.                          
  Other signs of{Roman}presence are the
 remains of a{Roman road}stretching to 
 the{S.W.}through Bradley Wood.However,
 most of this land has been farmed and 
 so only a few bricks remain.          
  It is also believed that the         
 foundations of{Bradley House Farm     
 are those of a house mentioned in the 
 original{Domesday Book.               </content>
