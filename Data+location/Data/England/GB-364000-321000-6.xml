		<title>06AEROPLANES</title>
		<content> On Wednesday I went to the airfield   
 that we thought was disused but as we 
 found out it had some aeroplanes      
 covered up in a hanger.  There were   
 also two aeroplanes outside.  We      
 thought that the two aeroplanes that  
 were outside were crop sprayers.  when
 we went to the end of the runway we   
 saw a sign that said intensive        
 aircraft movement.  There were two    
 chemical lorries there that had a load
 of chemicals by it.  So our maps were 
 wrong when they said that the airfield
 was disused becaues it is used for    
 crop planes and chemicals.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
