		<content> The area is divided by the ridge of   
 Kirkby Moor and Burney Fell. The      
 farmer is gouse moor, and the latter  
 sheep walk. To the west the land falls
 steeply towards the hamlets of        
 Grizebeck and chapels, which are      
 dominated by the huge spoil heaps of  
 Kirkby Moor slate quarry. To the east 
 the ground falls slightly less steeply
  through disused slate quarries and   
 the hamlet of Cawthwaite.             
 There are ten working farms in the    
 area, many having been bought as      
 family or holiday homes. Farming is   
 mainly sheep and store cattle. The    
 name Grizbeck is also applied to the  
 summit of the A5092 road which reachrs
 its highest point here (about 200ft)  
 as it crosses from Kendall and the    
 east to Millon and the west coast.
