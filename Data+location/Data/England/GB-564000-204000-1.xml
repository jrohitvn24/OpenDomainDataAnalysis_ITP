		<title>01WRITTLE, AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Writtle is a semi rural village about 
 4km. west of Chelmsford in the county 
 of Essex.                             
        Some of the interesting        
 features in the village are The Green,
 the church, the Agricultural College  
 and King John's Hunting Lodge, which  
 is now part of the college.           
        Writtle is mainly a residential
 area with little employment centred in
 the village itself. The only          
 employment based in the village       
 either concerns the college or        
 Marconi's                             
        Writtle was mentioned in the   
 original Domesday Book and was then   
 quite an important village in its own 
 right. Whereas now it is really a     
 satellite of Chelmsford.
