		<content>{The Grange Lady}A white lady is said  
 to haunt Hefferston Grange. One night 
 my mum who was working at the Grange  
 Hospital was waiting for my dad to    
 pick her up. She was in the waiting   
 room for about 30 minutes when she    
 heard footsteps in the corridor. She  
 looked but noone was there. She sat   
 down again to hear the footsteps once 
 more. This time she was too frightened
 to look so she locked the door. Ten   
 minutes later Dad arrived. She never  
 found out who's footsteps they were.  
{Haunted House}In a house on Beach     
 Hill an old lady smelt burning in her 
 kitchen. She rushed to see what it was
 and found her cooker on fire. She was 
 overcome by the heat and smoke and    
 the roof collapsed. When the firemen  
 arrived they could find no trace of   
 her. Today her screams can still be   
 heard late at night when you pass.    </content>
