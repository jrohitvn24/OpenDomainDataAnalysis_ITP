		<title>03CONSERVATION AT LOWER MOUNT.</title>
		<content>   In recent years Lower Mount Farm has
 undertaken several conservation       
 projects.                             
   Windmill Shaw, an area of about an  
 acre of mixed woodland, was replanted 
 early in May this year. The original  
 wood was felled in the 1950's when    
 there was a great demand for an       
 increase in arable acreage. Now that  
 there is no longer such a demand, it  
 was decided to replant part of the    
 woodland with oak, beech and birch.   
   The farm lies on gravel beds, and in
 the last few years many thousands of  
 tons of gravel have been dug out of   
 part of the farm. At the end of the   
 digging operation the top soil was    
 replaced, and the land was put back to
 agricultural use. The only sign that  
 any thing has happened to the fields  
 is that now several of them are about 
 5 metres lower than the rest.         </content>
