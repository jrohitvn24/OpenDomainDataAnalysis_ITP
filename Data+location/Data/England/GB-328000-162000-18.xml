		<title>18  Weston during the war</title>
		<content>   It was a very long time before      
 things returned to normal. There were 
 still shortages of many things. Ration
 books for food and clothing were still
 in use. There were open spaces in     
 Weston where buildings had been       
 destroyed in bombing raids. Many      
 houses, shops and churches disappeared
 and there was a long period of        
 cleaning up and rebuilding.           
   Everyone was glad that the war was  
 over but it was a long time before the
 men and women returned home. A bomb   
 was dropped behind our house and lots 
 of our windows were boken.            
   My grandad was stationed at Malta   
 when the war ended and did not return 
 to England until 1946. But he was     
 still in the Royal Navy until 1951.   
   As soon as the war was over people  
 were allowed to take down the blackout
 curtains and lights shone again.      </content>
