		<content>{Although this area is in a densely    
{settled part of Southern England and  
{only 5 miles from the town of Peters  
{field to the East and 20 miles from   
{the City of Portsmouth to the south,  
{its rural character &amp; location in the 
{South Downs has resulted in it being  
{very poorly served by public transport
{The nearest railway station is in     
{Petersfield,from where trains run to  
{London (Waterloo).Buses to the station
{&amp; to Winchester run about once every  
{hour during the week.However they only
{serve East Meon &amp; do not run after    
{8pm.As a result most people need to   
{have a car if they wish to travel out 
{of the area &amp; many parents spend time 
{bussing their children to various     
{destinations.The council have to      
{provide buses to transport pupils to  
{Secondary School in Petersfield &amp; to  
{6th Form College in Alton. }          </content>
