 The Church of St Andrew and St Mary   
 the Virgin though not mentioned in the
 1086 Domesday Book was first built in 
 stone at this time. Windows in the    
 tower are of the late Saxon Period.   
 The present building, one of the      
 largest churches in the district was  
 completed about 1230 in Cruciform     
 Early English style.The tall octagonal
 spire is visible far into the         
 surrounding countryside. An unusual   
 feature of the chancel is that it is  
 four feet wider than the nave. In the 
 South Transept are an Elizabethan     
 alabaster tomb and a fine brass       
 memorial, circa 1380 of a knight and  
 his lady,                             
          In a village that has changed
 little in recent times the church     
 remains a focal point.
