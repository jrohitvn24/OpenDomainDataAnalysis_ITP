		<content> General Outline Edlingham Area        
 This area is almost entirely rural,   
 consisting of farmland which is       
 largely devoted to sheep farming and  
 just a few herds of cattle, none of   
 which is used for dairy purposes. The 
 only crops grown are barley for local 
 consumption as cattle food and a      
 little wheat. There is a small        
 brick-works which is the areas only   
 bit of industry. The only village is  
 Edlingham, which might be more        
 correctly described as a hamlet,      
 consisting of 15 houses with no shop, 
 post office or public house; the only 
 amenities being a telephone box and a 
 pillar box. The total population is   
 about 90 which is increased slightly  
 when two or three holiday cottages are
 occupied and when the camp-site nearby
 is busy in the summer months.
