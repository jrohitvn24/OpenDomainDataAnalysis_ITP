    Softball  is  a  game  similar   to
rounders.   You have two teams equal in
number,  one  team  is the batting team
and the other team field.   The idea of
the game is to hit a ball  with the bat
and run round a square of  four  bases.
If you get round in one go you  get two
points.  You  can  have  three goes  at
hitting the ball and if you miss on the
third go  you  may run to first base as
long  as  nobody  is on it.  If you are
touched  with  the  ball  while between
bases,  or stumped,  or caught then you
are out.   Five  people  out  means you
change over and field instead of bat or
bat instead of field.    We  play  this
game at school.  The bat is much longer
than a rounders bat and you use a large
very {hard} ball  even  though the game
is called {soft} ball.
