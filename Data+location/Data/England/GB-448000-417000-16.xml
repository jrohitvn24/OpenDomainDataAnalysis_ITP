		<title>16THE CHURCHES -WENT HILLS</title>
		<content>                                       
    The parish church at Darrington is 
 outside the boundary of our area,     
 although the area lies within its     
 parish.                               
    Wentbridge has its own church, but 
 this is really a chapel of ease built 
 by Mrs. Hatchard of Hillthorpe in     
 1878. It replaced an earlier church   
 dedicated to John the Baptist.        
     Both villages once had            
 non-conformist chapels, but the one in
 Wentbridge has been converted into a  
 house, whilst the Darrington Chapel,  
 after being unused for several years, 
 is now the Farm Shop.                 
    Members of the Darrington Chapel   
 have held meetings in a home not far  
 from the chapel itself. We are not    
 sure if these are still being held.   
    There are no non-Christian         
 religious groups.                     </content>
