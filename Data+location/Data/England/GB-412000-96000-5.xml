		<content>    The parish church of{Saint Michael 
{and All Angels}stands on a mound      
 leading up from the{River Avon.}There 
 has almost certainly been a church or 
 chapel on this site since Saxon       
 times. The entry made for{Sopley}in   
 the{Domesday Book}of 1086 referred    
 only to the{mill}which stands a few   
 yards to the south. It is not         
 unusual however to find that a place  
 of worship was omitted from the survey
 and the popular belief is that the    
 Saxons would certainly have worshiped 
 here.                                 
    The present church is built of{Iron
 bearing rock quarried locally at{     
{Hengistbury Head,}this gives the      
 church its  attractive multi_coloured 
 appearance.
