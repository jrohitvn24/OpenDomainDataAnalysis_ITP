		<title>20Hundred Acre School,Streetly</title>
		<content> The children who contributed their    
 work for this block all came from     
{Hundred Acre Wood First School}who    
 at short notice took on the whole     
 block. But you wont find the school.  
 any longer. It was closed in July l985
 under a reorganisation scheme. It     
 was located at the end of Valentine   
 Close and had been opened in l966.    
 Throughout its life it gave a sound   
 educational background and a lot of   
 happiness to many children and their  
 teachers. An H.M.I. inspection in 1979
 described it as "a good school". The  
 parents were always willing to help   
 and the 12 kilometre squares of the   
 block were surveyed by families and a 
 teacher. I owe my thanks to these     
 families: McFarlane, Breen, Smith,    
 Bird, Kelly, Davies, Hanson, While,   
 &amp; Caine.{Tom Walsh.
