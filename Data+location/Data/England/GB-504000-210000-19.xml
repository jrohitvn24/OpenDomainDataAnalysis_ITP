		<title>19Clay Pigeon Shooting</title>
		<content> In the valley to the east of Eastbrook
 Hay Farm where there is the chalk     
 dell, there is a clay pigeon shooting 
 ground.{"Clay pigeons"}(which are now 
 made of brittle plastic and shaped    
 like plates) are catapulted into the  
 air and men with shotguns try to hit  
 them.  They score 3 points if they hit
 it with the first shot and 2 points if
 they hit with the second.             
 They catapult the clays in different  
 ways to{simulate the flight of        
{different sorts of birds (Pheasant,   
{Partridge, Pigeon etc.)}5 men stand at
 stations in an arc and take turns to  
 shoot, shouting "Pull!" when they are 
 ready. They each have 5 shots from    
 each station, making{25 shots in each 
{competition.}One of the clubs charges 
 Â£10 annual membership and Â£10 for a   
 shoot including cartridges.           
 Shotguns cost from Â£60.               </content>
