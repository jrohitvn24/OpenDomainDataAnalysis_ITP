		<title>03PAST ACTIVITY IN ASHTON (1)</title>
		<content>                                       
 The main economic activity in the     
 village of Ashton until recent times  
 was the mining of tin and agriculture.
 The tin mines were situated in the    
 mineralised zone which surrounds the  
 granite mass of Tregonning Hill. Apart
 from tin copper was also found and    
 extracted.                            
                                       
      In the late nineteenth century   
 the tin mines fell into decline due to
 cheaper overseas supplies. The men and
 their families who worked these mines 
 had to move away from the area in     
 search of new jobs. Many of them moved
 abroad to Australia, North America,   
 South America, South Africa and       
 various Commonwealth countries.
