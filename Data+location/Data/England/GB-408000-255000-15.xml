		<title>15OVERSLEY WOOD</title>
		<content>  Oversley Wood is owned by the        
 Forestry Commission. It is a mixed    
 forest with trees like the Western Red
 Cedar, grown for quick growth and     
 others like Oak and Ash grown for     
 slower maturity.                      
      Oversley is part of ancient      
 forest of Arden, which stretched      
 across west warwickshire. Then the    
 trees were mostly Oak and Ash. The Oak
 wood was used for building houses and 
 the bark sent to Evesham for tanning  
 leather. the ash was used for farm    
 carts, tools, handles and hurdles.    
        Today the wood is open to the  
 public and a trail has been arranged  
 with various stops to show all        
 different aspects of the wood. To gain
 entry you contact the head forester at
 Wootton Wawen. The various stops ask  
 you to use all your senses and make   
 you fully aware of your surroundings. </content>
