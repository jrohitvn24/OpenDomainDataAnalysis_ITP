		<content> RESULTS OF AN INTERVIEW IN COWES:     
 {What are the advantages of working on
{the Island?}Debatable.As we know,     
 factories on the Island are not       
 stable,due to the cost of bringing raw
 materials to the Island and we have   
 had the highest rate of unemployment  
 in England in the past.Environmentally
 it is also debatable.We have great    
 natural facilities but the arts are   
 sadly lacking and it depends what one 
 wants in life.{                       
{ Have you any ambitions for yourself  
{or your business?}My own ambition is  
 to help improve Cowes for everyone    
 both socially and economically.       
 {Do you depend on the sea for your    
{business?}The whole Island does,and   
 always has done,sometimes to its      
 detriment in progress,commerce etc.
