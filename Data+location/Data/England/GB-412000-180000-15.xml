		<title>15Leisure in Wroughton</title>
		<content>    Records show that sport and leisure
 pursuits have been important in       
 Wroughton since at least 1854 and even
 further back in 1660. Hunting, fishing
 and hawking have been recorded as     
 leisure activities.                   
    Today there are many different     
 types of recreation in Wroughton like 
 clubs. Some examples are Cubs, Scouts,
 Brownies, Guides, Army cadets, Youth  
 club, Karate, Wroughton A.S.C., Riding
 Stables, Dancing club and Red Cross.  
    The prices of the clubs range from 
 10p to Â£3.50 at the Riding Stables.   
    There are three playing areas in   
 Wroughton. These areas are Maunsall   
 Way, Weir Field and North Wroughton.  
    The older generation has not been  
 forgotten because we have just had a  
 bowling green installed. There is the 
 community centre next to the health   
 centre at the Ellendune.              </content>
