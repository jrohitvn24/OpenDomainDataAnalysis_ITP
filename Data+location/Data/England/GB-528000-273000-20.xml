		<title>20Playground games in St Ives.</title>
		<content> The games children play in 1985,aren't
 just computer games they are......... 
 Bulldog,hopscotch,football,tennis,walk
 ing and talking,off ground tig and    
 genarally mucking around.....in fact  
 they're much the same as those our    
 mums and dads played when they were   
 young.Girls tend to mix in with boys  
 because they like all sorts of games  
 and play them whether boys are playing
 them or not. Bulldog is a very popular
 game with primary schools.1 person is 
 it and he choses a person to run,and  
 that person has to try to get to the  
 other side without being caught.If    
 that person does get to the other side
 he shouts "BULLDOG" and when he does  
 so the other people run. If one person
 gets tug he has to be it for the next 
 game.The game goes on until there's   
 only one person left to run.He wins   
 the game.                             </content>
