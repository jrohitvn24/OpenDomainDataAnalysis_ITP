		<title>13OYSTER FARMING, WEST MERSEA.</title>
		<content> One of the small but very important   
 industries on Mersea is concerned with
 cultivating oysters. The oysters are  
 cultivated down in pools on the Hard. 
 The Hard is where all the boats are   
 kept.There is lots of mud at the      
 Hard.The oyster beds are like big     
 rectangles.The oysters are taken into 
 a hut.If the oysters are too small    
 they are put into a bucket so that the
 next time the men go out they can take
 the oysters and put them back into the
 sea.The oysters that they keep are    
 sent to restaurants  and cafes to be  
 eaten.The bigger oysters get more     
 barnacles,the smaller oysters do not  
 get as many.An oyster is a            
 shellfish.You can buy oysters on      
 Mersea at a hut in Coast Road.
