		<content>{Local History: Bronze Age}people were 
 the first known settlers in the area. 
 of Long Bennington. It is thought that
 there have been at least two Roman    
 sites in{Long Bennington.}When{William
{the Conqueror}sent his{Domesday Scouts
 round, they found "a priest with a    
 church" at Long Bennington. The priest
 was under the auspices of the{Abbey of
{Savigny.}During the Civil War,{Newark 
 (7 mls.North) was a{Royalist          
{Stronghold}and{Grantham}(8 mls.South) 
 was{Parliamentarian.}Long Bennington  
 was plundered by both sides.          
{Village Hall: Mrs. Grote_Joyce}lived  
 in the Manor House (now the Manor     
 Hotel). She disliked the local vicar  
 so she had her own church built near  
 her house. She also employed her own  
 vicar.After her death the church was  
 given to the village.
