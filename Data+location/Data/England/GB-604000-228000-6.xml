		<content>   In our School pond we found a lot of
{Carnivorous creatures}such as         
 Pondskaters , Water boatmen , Water   
 Mites , Common Newt Tadpoles and      
 Mayfly Nymphs . We also found a few   
{Herbivores}like the Great Pond Snail. 
   We found a{Great crested Newt}and   
 we kept it in class. Soon it laid its 
 eggs{singly}on the pond weed. After   
 two days we returned it to the pond.We
 syphoned out some pond water and put  
 it under the{microscope}we saw a      
 Daphnia. The Pond is about 2.9 by 6   
 metres.                               
   In the school garden we get         
 large numbers of Stag Beetles, with a 
 length of up to 7cm. They are the     
{biggest beetles}in Britain, the males 
 have horns of up to 2cm long , they   
 may look dangerous but they do not    
 hurt as much as the females ,whose    
 antlers are only about .5 cm long.    </content>
