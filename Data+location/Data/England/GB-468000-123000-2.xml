		<title>02LANGRISH AREA (2)</title>
		<content> This area is essentially agricultural.
 Most of the land is used for crops    
 such as wheat, barley and oats. There 
 are several  farms which are mainly   
 crop farms but there is some beef     
 farming. The land in the south is     
 mainly permanent pasture or dairy     
 cows, but in the north, rape is being 
 introduced for its oil. Although there
 is a lot of agricultural land, a      
 reasonable amount of woodland remains.
 A large percentage is decidous        
 woodland including a large amount of  
 beech trees. Many flowers grow and    
 flourish in these woods, copses and   
 hangers. The land in this area is     
 quite hilly and covered in a network  
 of footpaths for the walker. This     
 rural area has few large roads, sparse
 postal services and only two churches.
 This is not an important historic area
 but contains a few earthworks.        </content>
