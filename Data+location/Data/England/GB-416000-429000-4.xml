		<title>04Housing in South Bradford.</title>
		<content> There is a great variety of housing in
 this part of Bradford ranging from 15 
 storey{high rise flats}to small       
{cottages}dating from the mid 17th     
 century and from {semi detached}      
 corporation houses to Bolling Hall    
 now a museum but parts of which are an
 example of a Medieval{country house.} 
 Many of the{back to back}mill workers 
 homes were replaced by high rise flats
 and{maisonettes}but many of these     
 concrete wonders  of the 1960's and   
 70's are now showing structural       
 weaknesses and the Newby Square       
 complex is now being emptied prior to 
 demolition and yet the buildings are  
 less than 20 years old.The remaining  
 back to back houses are being         
 renovated and demolition seems to be a
 thing of the past.Many of the new     
 homes are being built of stone or     
 imitation stone.                      </content>
