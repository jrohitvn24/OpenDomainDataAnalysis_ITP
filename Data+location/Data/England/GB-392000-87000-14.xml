		<content>{Swineham Farm.                        
 The swineham farm is owned by English 
 China Clay but worked by many differnt
 farmers.The farmer interviwed does't  
 work the farm any more but lives in   
 the farmhouse there.About 450 dairy   
 and beef cattle are run on the split  
 up farm.The farmhouse is only 6 feet  
 above sea level and much off the farm 
 land is below.It's water table is     
 between 3-6 feet deep in most fields. 
 They are well drained and have to be  
 fertilized regularly.Dung or chemicals
 are used.The farm is now not very well
 run because the fileds are not used to
 full capacity.The fields are mostly   
 used for grazing and hay.They have a  
 pot ash base with ammounts of sand in.
