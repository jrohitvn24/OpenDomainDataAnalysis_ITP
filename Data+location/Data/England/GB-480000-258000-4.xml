 serving thousands of Northamptonians  
 for many years.                       
   In the last 60 years or so the firm 
 has grown from a horse and cart to a  
 fleet of{58 vehicles.}In 1924, their  
 first motor vehicle _ a Model 'T' Ford
 was used to carry coal. Also at that  
 time, on market days, for{6d}one could
 travel to Northampton. The firm saw a 
 period of steady expansion from 1920  
 until the Second World War; in{1928   
 the first summer express was started _
{Great Yarmouth!}During the war years  
 there were requisitions from troops   
 and munition workers.                 
   In 1974, Â£20,000 of damage was      
 caused when a fire hit the workshops. 
 While the fire was raging 30 coaches  
 were driven to safety; fortuanately,
