		<title>12THE GIANT OF THE MOUNT</title>
		<content> The giant Cormoran lived on St.       
 Michael's Mount. His wife was dead so 
 he had no-one to cook for him. He made
 the people of Marazion give him a     
 bullock each day to eat. One night a  
 travelling tinker, called Jack,       
 persuaded the men of the village to   
 help him dig a big pit at the bottom  
 of the Mount. Next morning Jack       
 insulted Cormoran, who grew angry and 
 chased him. Cormoran fell into the pit
 with only his head sticking out and   
 couldn't move. Jack sent for his Aunt 
 Nancy from Gulval, who told the giant 
 that he must learn to behave. She fed 
 him on saffron buns and starry-gazy   
 pasties and at last the giant promised
 to be good. It took a week to dig him 
 out of the pit. He married Aunt Nancy 
 and lived happily ever after.
