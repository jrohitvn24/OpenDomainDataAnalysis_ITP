		<title>01OXSHOTT &amp; ENVIRONS</title>
		<content> This is an attractive residential area
 with open spaces, woods and fields in 
 an undulating landscape. The busy dual
 carriageway A3 passes through the NW  
 corner and the Waterloo to Guildford  
 commuter railway line passes through  
 NE to SW. The area covers Oxshott and 
 part of Cobham and is part of         
 the Green Belt.                       
 Some of Oxshott is Crown Estate land  
 with many restrictions on the sort of 
 buildings that can be erected. The    
 houses are mixed in type - there are  
 several estates of smaller houses with
 small gardens and also many large     
 mansions surrounded by beautiful      
 gardens.                              
 There are 3 different types of        
 schools, some small shops and 2       
 churches. There is virtually no local 
 industry and many of the residents    
 work in London.                       </content>
