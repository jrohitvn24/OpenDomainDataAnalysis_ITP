		<title>12Legends &amp; Stories,Whitby 1.</title>
		<content>  Whilst visiting Whitby,{Bram Stoker} 
 wrote the famous horror story of{     
{"Dracula."}He used parts of the town  
 as locations in his book. Visitors to 
 Whitby can follow the{Dracula Trail.} 
  The evil Count arrived by sea on a   
 shipwrecked schooner which collided   
 with{Tate Hill Pier.}He jumped ashore 
 in the form of a black dog and raced  
 up to{St.Mary's Churchyard.}He changed
 into a bat and later flew to the south
 of England!                           
  A passing{pirate}was once said to    
 have stolen the Abbey Bells. When his 
 ship was wrecked off{Black Nab,}all   
 were lost and the bells sank to the   
 bottom of the sea. If you shout your  
 lover's name aloud from the cliff top 
 on{Halloween}you may hear the bells   
 ring! This means your love is true and
 you will hear your wedding bells      
 within a year.                        </content>
