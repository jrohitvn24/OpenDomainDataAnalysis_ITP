		<title>11Coastal Erosion</title>
		<content> To stop longshore drift from carrying 
 away sand from the beaches,Bournemouth
 Council has built groynes,including a 
 very long one at the end of           
 Hengistbury Head.Unfortunately this   
 has resulted in severe erosion taking 
 place to the east of the long groyne  
 where the cliffs and the promenade are
 being eaten away.This is also         
 happening at the neck of the          
 promontory,near the Double Dykes.Some 
 people think that the sea could break 
 through and make the Head into an     
 island unless preventative action is  
 taken.                                
 Hengistbury Head also suffers from    
 erosion caused by people walking over 
 it.Where they have not kept to the    
 paths the grass has been worn down and
 the rain is washing the soil          
 away,making deep gullies in places.   
 Conservation is being undertaken.     </content>
