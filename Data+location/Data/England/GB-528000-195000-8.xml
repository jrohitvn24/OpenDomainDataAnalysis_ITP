		<content> In our part of Western Enfield we have
 eleven educational                    
 establishments.These include four     
 primary schools which are             
 DeBohun,Merryhills,Eversley and Grange
 Park.Grange Park covers a site of     
 about eight acres.The view from the   
 playground is stunning.The Infant     
 School has an unusual circular hall.  
 The three Secondry Schools are        
 Southgates Upper and Lower School and 
 St Ignatius Lower School.The former is
 linked to Eversley,Grange Park and    
 DeBohun.                              
 Oaktree and Waverley Special Schools  
 are also in our area.They are for     
 children who have severe learning     
 difficulties or are profoundly        
 handicapped.                          
 Grange Park Preparatory School and    
 Vita-et-Pax are both Independent      
 Schools.                              </content>
