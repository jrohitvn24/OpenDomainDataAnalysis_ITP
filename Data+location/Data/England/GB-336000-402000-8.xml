		<content> Mrs Townley used to be a teacher at   
 Maghull C of E and tells a story of an
 experience the took her back in time. 
 "Mrs Townley was waiting for a bus at 
 the end of Dodds Lane when she noticed
 the road surface had been worn away to
 reveal the original surface.This took 
 her back in time to when the local    
 farmers used to go to the pub and have
 a few drinks on their way to market.  
 One farmer had too much and only just 
 got into his cart.Luckily the horse   
 knew his way home but as they went    
 over a bridge the farmer fell of the  
 back and broke his leg. The horse just
 carried on and went into the stable   
 when he got home. That is where the   
 farmers wife found the horse and cart 
 and realised something had happened.  
 Luckily she found her husband and     
 brought him home.
