		<title>05Waltham Windmill History.</title>
		<content>   There have been three mills in      
 Waltham. The first was a post mill    
 built in 1646  which worked until 1747
 to 1750 when it collapsed, then it    
 was repaired.One afternoon the miller 
 was in his house eating his lunch when
 suddenly he heard a crash and  saw the
 second mill had collapsed.He decided  
 not to build another post mill ,so he 
 built a tower Windmill.The third mill 
 was the last six sailed mill to be    
 built in Lincolnshire.The work started
 in 1875 and took five years to build. 
   Over a quarter of a million bricks  
 from the brick pits in Barnoldby-le-  
 Beck Road were  used in the           
 construction of the present mill.The  
 six-sailed mill used wind and engine  
 power.By 1979 four of the sails had   
 been removed,two in 1913.The Waltham  
 Windmill Trust Society was formed when
 the owner considered selling.         </content>
