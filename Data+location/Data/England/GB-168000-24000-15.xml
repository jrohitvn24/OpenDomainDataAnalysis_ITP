		<content> Trelowarren Craft Centre is the base  
 for the Cornwall Crafts Assoc.This    
 association is a thriving one and     
 holds regular exhibitions.First of all
 we went to see the potter and asked   
 him some questions We asked him how   
 many pots he made in a day.He told us 
 300 and he gets 20,000 visiters a     
 year.The biggest pots cost Â£40 or Â£50.
 To make a pot it takes about 5        
 mins.and 10-14 hrs.to fire .He also   
 told us about the weaver because she  
 wasn't there.He told us about the     
 shuttle which she weaves with.She     
 makes rugs and bookmarks.The most     
 expensive rugs cost Â£120.The design   
 takes about 2-5 hours and a lot of    
 people visit her.In the future we hope
 that the Crafts assoc. will continue  
 to grow. Only time will tell.
