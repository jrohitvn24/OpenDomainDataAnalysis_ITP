		<content>{Health in Whitchurch.}It costs a      
 million pounds to run the Cottage     
 Hospital,2 million for Deermoss  every
 year.{Deermoss Geriatric Hospital}was 
 the old town workhouse. The chapel is 
 now the physiotherapy room.In the day 
 room there were old people having cups
 of tea.They cannot look after         
 themselves so they get heartbroken    
 because they are lonely and 64 nurses 
 look after them.{The Cottage Hospital 
 has 20 nurses and 6 doctors.Seven     
 consultants from Shrewsbury attend    
 both hospitals.In the occupational    
 therapy room people make baskets and  
 pots.They have a lecture room for     
 nurses to keep up with the latest     
 knowledge.{Patients go to Shrewsbury  
 for major treatment.The hospital makes
 sure patients homes are safe before   
 they return. Social and voluntary     
 workers help the hospitals.           </content>
