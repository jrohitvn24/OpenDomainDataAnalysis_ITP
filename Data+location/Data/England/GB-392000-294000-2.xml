		<content> A half timbered Tudor style building  
constructed about 1450 by John de      
Mottesley as a manor house.   It       
remained a family home until 1820 when 
it became an inn used by miners and    
foundry workers.                       
 The building fell into disrepair and  
was saved from demolition by W. Butler 
&amp; Co. Ltd., a local brewery who tried  
to restore it as closely as possible to
its original condition.                
 Only the West wing remains today,     
though it is a fine example of Tudor   
workmanship.   Inside the ceilings are 
low and the floors uneven.   The walls 
have wooden panels and the ceilings are
decorated with vines, leaves,birds, and
fruit.   There is a massive chimney and
fireplace which was built around a     
large oak tree, half of which forms one
of the main supporting pillars of the  
building.                              </content>
