		<content>My favourite TV programmes are those   
for children on ITV,also Â£Street Hawk' 
Â£Grange Hill' and Â£The Young Ones'on   
BBC.   I watch the television when I   
get home from school  and I watch it on
Saturdays.   Yes, I watch it all the   
time unless I have to go somewhere or  
do something else, but I donÂ£t watch it
all that much because I have to go to  
bed at  8pm.   I only read the papers  
to see what is on the TV or I just read
a few things in the daily paper. All   
the newspapers  that are free come     
through my door like the Chase Post,   
The Cannock Trader and the Cannock     
Chronicle. There used to be another    
local paper called the Cannock         
Advertiser but it was killed off by the
give away papers.   The papers that we 
have to pay for and fetch ourselves are
The Sun and the evening paper called   
The Express and Star.                  </content>
