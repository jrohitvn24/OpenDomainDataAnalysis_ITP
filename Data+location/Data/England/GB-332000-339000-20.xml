		<title>20A Raft Race on the River Dee</title>
		<content> A raft race is held on the river in   
 Erbistock.The race is not held every  
 year because there is sometimes the   
 problem of parking cars by the        
 river.All different kinds of people   
 enter the race.Young farmers,         
 newspaper representatives, factory    
 representatives, and groups of people 
 who enter just for the fun of it.The  
 race is interesting and often         
 hilarious and is held on the first    
 Sunday in September.                  
 The race starts slightly upstream from
 the Boat Inn and has a course of 2    
 miles downstream to Overton Bridge.The
 money raised goes to various charities
 and the organisers are the local Boy  
 Scouts.Sometimes they have a Duck Race
 instead. People buy a plastic duck    
 which is raced against others, the    
 winners getting prizes.
