		<title>16The City  Farm.</title>
		<content> The city farm is a small piece of land
 near the Howitzer's Club.Inside there 
 is a playground and a section where   
 the animals are kept.One of the main  
 attractions is a donkey called Sonny  
 who gives donkey rides.There are lots 
 of other animals at the farm including
 several sheep,lots of goats,one       
 calf,and more than 2O chickens. There 
 are some rabbits, including an        
 Angora.Many Hillfields children see   
 farm animals for the first time when  
 they go to the farm. This year,       
 1985,there was a farm float at the    
 Coventry Carnival, with some of the   
 regular farm visitors on it.
