		<content> The junior and infants schools are in 
 one building made of brick. It was    
 opened on 5th November 1932. We start 
 at the junior school when we are seven
 and leave when we are eleven. We have 
 7 teachers, 4 women and 3 men, and 194
 pupils. There are 30 pupils in our    
 class which is class 1. My teacher is 
 Mr. Farms and the headmaster is Mr.   
 Blenkinsopp. School starts at 9 am    
 and ends at 3.40 every day. We do     
 quite a lot of sports. We have        
 swimming and P.E. once a week. We have
 a football and a netball team and one 
 of the teachers is starting a cricket 
 team. Every year we have a sports     
 day, a swimming gala, a football and a
 rounders tournament. We have two      
 dinner nannies called Mrs. Goddard and
 Mrs. Huygill and a caretaker called   
 Mr. Shepherd.
