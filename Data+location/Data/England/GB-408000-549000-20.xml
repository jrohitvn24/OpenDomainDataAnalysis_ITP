		<content> The only practical means of transport 
 to and from the Consett area is via   
 the road network. Since the closure of
 the steelworks in the town, the       
 proportion of households which boast a
 car has fallen considerably. A wide   
 variety of car makes are bought in the
 area, though our school survey        
 suggested that Ford is still the most 
 popular. Four star petrol currently   
 costs just under Â£2 per gall. Roads   
 are continually being repaired in the 
 area and the new Leadgate by-pass is  
 nearing completion at a cost of       
 approx. Â£2.5 to Â£3 million            
    Rail transport was an essential cog
 in the workings of the local steel and
 coal industry, but declined rapidly   
 with the closure of the steelworks.   
 The lines finally closed in 1983      
 giving us miles of derelict lines     
 Derwentside  Council will tackle this.</content>
