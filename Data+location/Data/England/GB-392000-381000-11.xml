 When the last of the Poynton coalmines
 closed in 1935,the population of the  
 village was under 4,000.Since then the
 character of the village has changed  
 and the population has increased.In   
 the 1950's there was a rapid increase 
 from under 6,000 to the now estimated 
 15,000.Poynton is now a commuter      
 village.Unemployment is much lower    
 than the national average and the     
 great majority of people work in      
 Stockport and Manchester.A small      
 percentage work at British Aerospace  
 in Woodford,while an increasing       
 percentage work within the village.   
 Several large housing estates have    
 been built in the last 25years to     
 accomodate the large population       
 increase.Thus from being a village    
 Poynton has become almost a small town</content>
