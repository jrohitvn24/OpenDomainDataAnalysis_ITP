		<title>11HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> Home life is very{tranquil}and at     
 least half the people who live in the 
 area do so from choice rather than    
 necessity. But, lacking shops and     
 other facilities of a town or larger  
 village, we are forced to fall back on
 our own resources, at least growing   
 our own vegetables or going further   
 towards self-sufficiency by keeping   
 chickens and making use of local grown
 fruit and vegetables for preserves and
 wine. Apart from{animals}for utilit-  
 arian purposes, almost every household
 has at least one pet animal and most  
 are multi cat/dog households. Labrador
 retrievers are the most popular breed 
 of dog. The cats are divided into two 
 groups household pets and semi-feral  
 farm cats, but all do their share of  
 reducing the enormous population of   
 rabbits and small rodents. The        
 proportion of horse riders is high.   </content>
