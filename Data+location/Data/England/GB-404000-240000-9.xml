		<title>09Badsey First School</title>
		<content>     The school opened in the year     
 1895. There are 224 pupils aged       
 between 4 years and 10. Most of the   
 children travel from Badsey. Other    
 children travel from Wickhamford and  
 Aldington.                            
     The school has a headmaster and 7 
 teaching staff.We have a playing field
 and playground.                       
     The main building is now 90 years 
 old and is made of brick. The hall is 
 more modern with large windows. There 
 are two temporary classrooms.         
     We have 2 computers, A V.C.R.,    
 slide projector and a photocopier.    
     Also we have an ancillary helper  
 (who also controls the children       
 crossing the road).                   
     At dinner time children bring a   
 packed lunch and are supervised by 5  
 ladies.
