		<content>              MR MACLOY                
                                       
   Mr.Macloy has been a farmer all his 
 life. He grew up on a farm, that is   
 how he learned his job. He starts     
 work at 8 o'clock in the morning and  
 sometimes finishes very late at night.
   Mr.Macloy does not like clearing the
 pigs out, he enjoys riding about the  
 farm in his Range Rover. He worries   
 about people getting hurt and about   
 pests eating his crops,magpies        
 especially are a great source of worry
 to him. When I was at Mr Macloy's farm
 I liked the geese best.They were nice.
