		<title>01GENERAL VILLAGE DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Horseheath is a typical rural village.
 It had a major traffic problem with   
 the A 604 Cambridge Colchester road   
 passing through it. This however was  
 replaced by a bypass some    years    
 ago. Many of the local inhabitants    
 comment on the improvement in the     
 quality of life in the village since  
 this happened.There have been         
 casualties as a result of the         
 relocated road.Two village pubs have  
 closed.The plant nursery has survived 
 on the strength of the clientelle it  
 had built up when the road was open.  
 Manor Farm in the centre of the       
 village had to have a tractor bridge  
 built over the new road, to enable    
 access to their land on the other     
 side.The outstanding feature of the   
 landscape is rolling fields of arable 
 land                                  
                                       </content>
