		<content>    Bures is made up of the three      
 different parishes of Mount Bures,    
 Bures Hamlet and Bures St.Mary.Each is
 a small comnunity in a rural setting. 
    Mount Bures is named after The     
 Mount which is to be found next to the
 Norman church which goes back to 1066.
 Bures St. Mary and Bures Hamlet are   
 the most populous and lie either side 
 of the River Stour which forms the    
 county boundary of Essex and Suffolk. 
    Most of the farms in the area are  
 arable and are widely spread in       
 rolling countryside cut by the valley 
 of the Stour and its tributary        
 Cambridge Brook.                      
    There is one British Rail branch   
 line running through the area from    
 Marks Tey to Sudbury which is used by 
 conmuters and people shopping in      
 surrounding towns.
