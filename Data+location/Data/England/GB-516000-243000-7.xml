		<content> Each Saturday there is a bustling     
 outdoor{market}in the town square     
 with some 50 stalls selling food and  
 produce, clothing, plants and a wide  
 range of consumer goods.              
 A local{Carnival}is held annually,    
 after the Carnival Queen and her      
 attendants have been chosen. A grand  
 procession of decorated floats &amp; other
 displays wends its way through the    
 town, and a day of Carnival festivity 
 and fun is enjoyed by everyone.       
 At Christmas time the town is enhanced
 with coloured{lights}which are cere-  
 moniously switched on each year. These
 lights are very professional, easily  
 outshining other nearby towns, and    
 really add to the seasonal cheer.     
 A travelling {fair}arrives annually, &amp;
 is set up in the market square, a     
 relic of the original charter fair of 
 earlier times.                        </content>
