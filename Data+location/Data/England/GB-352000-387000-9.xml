		<content> Donna Forster and Tracy Lally         
 interviewed Mr Woodward head of       
 education at Greystone Heath Approved 
 School near Penketh. The school was   
 built in for young offenders          
 1834 but now there is only the old gym
 left the rest is modern. The 24 boys  
 mostly come from Liverpool. 10 years  
 ago there were 104 boys, but now due  
 to cuts there are only 24, the rest go
 to Foster homes. The boys are aged 14 
 to 16. It was set up here because     
 there was a large number of Quakers   
 living in Lancashire. The boys hate it
 here and occasionaly fights break out 
 over small things like name calling.  
 When improvement shows,  the boys can 
 go home if they've got one to go to.  
 For the 24 boys,  36 staff are        
 employed.In the past few years the    
 number of petty crimes has risen.
