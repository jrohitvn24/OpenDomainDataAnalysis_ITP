		<title>13GRANGE CHINE NR. BRIGHSTONE</title>
		<content>  As you cross over the Military Road  
 near Grange Farm there is a gravel    
 path leading towards the sea. If you  
 follow this you sea the chine, small  
 and unexpected from the road. Chines  
 are a common coastal feature on the   
 Isle of Wight.                        
  The steep slopes of the chine walls  
 are rugged and have a few small bushes
 covering them.Wild flowers and nettles
 also grow here. In the bottom of the  
 chine is a dirty small stream. This is
 narrow in the chine, then it widens   
 out to form a lagoon before           
 continuing, narrow again, towards the 
 sea.                                  
  The cloudy stream actually colours   
 the sea at the mouth of the chine.We  
 could even see this from the top of   
 Brighstone Downs nearly 4km away.     
  At the top of the chine there is a   
 camp site on the cliff.               </content>
