 hotels and guest houses to judge the  
 range of accommodation available.These
 included one large *** hotel,two pubs 
 and various small family businesses.  
 The prices ranged from{Â£7.50 to Â£20   
{for basic Bed and Breakfast.}Only two 
 were open all year.The rest opened    
 only for "the Season".All catered for 
 a wide age range and drew their guests
 from all parts of Britain.            
    Few of the smaller guest houses    
 were offering services other than     
 basic food and lodging.(One offered to
 Baby-Sit!) The larger hotel provided  
 Golf,Dancing,Tennis,Swimming and      
 pleasant gardens.The smaller hotel had
 tennis courts.There are Riding Stables
 in the village.Some villagers are     
 turning to the less time-consuming    
 use of their premises as{"Self        
{-Catering Holiday Flats".             </content>
