		<title>18Supernatural Eccleshall</title>
		<content> Eccleshall has no famous ghost story, 
 but it does have some ghosts. It is a 
 fact that these restless spirits have 
 been experienced by people who did not
 previously know of their existence.   
 One spectre is that of a benign       
 elderly gentleman who has made himself
 known, in a friendly way, to visitors 
 in his house. Another is more         
 frightening and seems to wander       
 restlessly over an area to the west of
 Eccleshall. This is believed to be the
 spirit of a man who committed suicide 
 about a hundred years ago.            
 Poltergeists have also been           
 experienced in houses in the area.
