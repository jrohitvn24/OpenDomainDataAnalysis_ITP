		<content>    There are no{shops}in the village  
 now. The{post office}opens on 3 days  
 for a few hours. Nearly every one goes
 out of the village to their jobs.     
    2 people work at the pub, one or   
 two have a business where they saw    
 logs. Two people work at the garage.  
    There are 2{grocery vans}that come 
 twice a week  and a{bakery van.}Most  
 shopping is done in Newport 7 miles   
 away. But the buses are every two     
 hours. It costs 85p to Newport or 60p 
 in the other direction to Yarmouth.   
    The{library van}comes round every  
 fortnight. If old people can not get  
 out to the van the driver will bring  
 about 20 books in for them to choose  
 from.He has childrens books and adult 
 books and will get any books you ask  
 for.
