		<title>05Longstone Edge.</title>
		<content> This high ridge of limestone rock runs
 roughly East to West and is about 3 km
 long. It provides a notable viewpoint 
 over the surrounding country.         
 It has been mined for more than a     
 century. Today this is not for lead   
 but for fluorspar and associated      
 minerals. A belt of deciduous trees   
 marks the Edge -an old practice where 
 land has been poisoned by lead mining 
 -{"Bellanded"}-and might harm animals 
 grazing it.                           
 A recent opencast mine went to a depth
 of 100 feet but this has now been     
 filled in and the scars are growing   
 over.                                 
 Several footpaths lead up to the Edge 
 from neighbouring villages and these  
 are probably old work routes.         
 The slopes behind the Edge are pitted 
 with old mine workings.
