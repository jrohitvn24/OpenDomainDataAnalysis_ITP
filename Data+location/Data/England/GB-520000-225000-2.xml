		<content> Stevenage was a small North Hertford- 
 shire{market town}The first settlement
 in Stevenage was possibly in{Roman}   
 times as pottery,and burial mounds now
 called the Six Hills, have been found.
 The Six Hills lie beside what used to 
 be the{Great North Road.}Stevenage was
 designated to be a{New Town}in 1946 by
 the  New Towns Act  it was  built to  
 relieve  the  housing  problem  in    
 London.So Stevenage became the first  
 New Town.In the New Town there is a   
 traffic-free shopping centre and it   
 is surrounded by six{neighbourhoods.} 
 Houses were built by the Development  
 Corporation.They also built neighbour_
 hood shopping centres, community,and  
 day centres,schools,pubs,churches and 
 flats.Since then Stevenage has grown  
 with the building of FAIRLANDS        
 VALLEY PARK and the LEISURE CENTRE    
 plus two industrial estates.          </content>
