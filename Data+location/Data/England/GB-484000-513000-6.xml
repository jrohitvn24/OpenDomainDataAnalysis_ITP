		<content>{HOME LIFE:-                           
 My name is Karl and I live on a farm  
 not far from Lythe.I am 11 years old  
 and go to Lythe village school.When I 
 am not at school I spend most of my   
 time working on the farm with my Dad. 
 We have to feed our sheep and cattle  
 each day. Sometimes I go to Lythe with
 my Dad because he has some fields and 
 animals there.                        
 After work,we go back to the farm for 
 our dinner.On  Sunday we have a big   
 dinner of meat,potatoes,vegetables,   
 Yorkshire Pudding and gravy.During the
 week we usually have meat or sausages 
 and chips.                            
 The rest of the time I spend playing  
 outside on my bike or with my         
 favourite toy which is a swingball.   
 After my tea, I sometimes watch       
 television until it is time to go to  
 bed.                                  </content>
