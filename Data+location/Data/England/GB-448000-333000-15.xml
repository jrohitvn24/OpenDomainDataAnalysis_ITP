		<title>15LONG EATON. Tenements.</title>
		<content>  Within the half century 1864-1912    
 Long Eaton became a highly prosperious
 town. This was due in a large part to 
 the growth of the Lace Industry.      
  Traditionaly the industry was one of 
 small firms. Many of these joined     
 together to share large tenement      
 factories.                            
  Many people were able to start their 
 businesses with a limited amount of   
 money, sharing the costs of overheads.
 Some were built by lace machine makers
 others by speculators unconnected by  
 the trade, such as E.T.Hooley.        
  The largest of these tenemnets are to
 be found in Leopold Street, where the 
 factory on the eastern side of the    
 street is 300m long, four floors high 
 and built in the 1880's.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
