		<title>20Bus trip - Culcheth to Leigh</title>
		<content> First you walk to a bus stop. This is 
 a metal post about two metres high,   
 with a square metal sign at the top.  
 There is usually a timetable fastened 
 onto it. This is a piece of paper     
 with the times that buses run, so     
 you can work out how long you've got  
 to wait. As you get on you have to pay
 the required fare to the driver.      
 Buses used to have a second man called
 a conductor to collect the fares, but 
 buses hardly ever have them now.  The 
 journey is quite bumpy but apart from 
 that it's okay!  It takes about 12    
 minutes to get to Leigh, depending on 
 the traffic, with about 7 bus stops on
 the way.{
