		<title>20A Saturday.</title>
		<content> On Saturdays I wake up and look       
 through the window and look at the    
 weather and then I go downstairs.Iwash
 my face and brush my teeth and then I 
 eat my breakfast and if it is a nice  
 day I go out to play.If it is raining 
 I play inside or I go to the library  
 and read books there.Sometimes I go to
 my cousin's house and play there. I go
 to the park and sometimes I go        
 shopping with my Mum.We sometimes shop
 on Foleshill Rd. I like going to the  
 Co-op and V.Sports and Jib's the      
 best.When I go to the Co-op I skid    
 around on the slippy floor. I wheel   
 the trolley for my Mum.
