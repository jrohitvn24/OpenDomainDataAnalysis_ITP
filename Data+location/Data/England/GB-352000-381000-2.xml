		<content> At Norton Priory you can see the      
 many finds which the site has         
 yielded.One of the many exhibits      
 which interest the hundreds of school 
 parties which visit the museum        
 annually,is a coffin of a Canon,who   
 lived at the priory hundreds of years 
 ago.(Canons lived at the Priory from  
 1134-1536)                            
  Looking at the many exhibits,one gets
 a good impression of what life was    
 like in an ancient priory.Since the   
 site has been excavated,one can walk  
 in the undercroft and look at the     
 magnificent statue of St.Christopher. 
 On Bank holidays at Norton Priory,    
 Family Fun Days are held.I wonder what
 the Canons would think if they        
 returned!There's an excellent         
 education department at the museum    
 which helps visiting children.
