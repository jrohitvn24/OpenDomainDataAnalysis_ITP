		<title>06SHROVE TUESDAY, SCARBOROUGH</title>
		<content> On{Shrove Tuesday}we have pancakes for
 dinner and after we shall go to the   
{beach}and skip.Skipping on this       
 day is an old traditon for            
{Scarborough}people.Some stupid people 
 like teenagers can get other teenagers
 and throw them into the freezing cold 
 water with all their clothes on.      
 After we had enough of skipping we    
 would go and get a huge stick of candy
 floss and then we would go on the     
 amusements.                           
 Me and my Aunty Rachel nearly got     
 thrown in the sea, but Dad got the    
 older lads with a skipping rope.      
  The road by the sea is closed off on 
{Shrove Tuesday}so the skipping can    
 take place safely. Some people skip on
 the beach, but we skip on the road.   
 We have a realy good day and then go  
 to my Nanna's for some more pancakes!
