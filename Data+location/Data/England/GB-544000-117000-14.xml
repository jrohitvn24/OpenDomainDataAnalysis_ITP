		<content>   Building started on the site of a   
{Nursery}in 1983. The plan is to compl-
 ete the Estate by 1987. The site is   
 about 7 acres; it usually takes five  
 months to build a house depending on  
 the weather and the size of the house.
 The houses are either terraced or de- 
 tatched. The 4 &amp; 5 bedroom houses have
 double glazing but not the smallest.  
   The most expensive houses are{Â£95450
 and the cheapest{Â£35450.}Some have in-
 creased by Â£15000 in only five months.
   A{'Self Build'}development began in 
 June 1982 on the grounds of a Nursing 
 Home. An advertisement in a local     
 newspaper asked for people willing to 
 build their own homes. Altogether 62  
 houses were built. To get the Scheme  
 finished within 18 months the men     
 worked every weekend from 7.30am until
 at least 5.30pm, sometimes later and  
 for 3 evenings a week.                </content>
