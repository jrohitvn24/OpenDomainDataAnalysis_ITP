{house}near the bottom of the{Coppice.}
 the Coppice is a big hill.There is a  
 park,bowling green and a tennis       
 court.I have a very modern house which
 was built in 1983.Inside there are    
 nine rooms but we only use 8 and the  
 other roomfor storage.my house is made
 of bricks and inside the walls are    
 plaster-board covered with wallpaper. 
 On the floor are carpets and curtains 
 at the windows for when it goes dark. 
 There are around 200 houses on our    
 estate and I live in the first house. 
 My house has a living room,dining     
 room,utility room,three bedrooms,a    
 spare room and two bathrooms.We also  
 have a built-in garage and a shed at  
 the side.The shed is on the tarmac.We

 panel fencing round.
