		<title>02APPALOOSA STUD</title>
		<content>  My friend and I went to interview    
 Miss De Rivaz at Icomb. Miss De       
 Rivaz's mother and father own the stud
 farm, where they breed Appaloosa      
 Horses. Their address is Ash Cottage, 
 Icomb, Stow-on-the-Wold GLOS.         
 She told us that they owned 15 acres. 
 While she took us around the stables  
 she told us that she took part in     
 dressage competitions. She also told  
 us  that she sold some of her horses  
 abroad to such places as Africa,      
 Australia and India.                  
 Appaloosa foals look mostly like      
 palomino but as they grow older they  
 have more and more spots.Some         
 Appaloosa foals are born spotty and as
 they get older some of them go very   
 very spotty.Appaloosa horses are white
 all over with brown spots or black    
 spots or some are brown all over with 
 a white bottom and brown spots.       </content>
