		<title>05TOWN MAYOR</title>
		<content>  A group of children were invited to  
 question the town mayor about his     
 lifestyle in relation to his          
 duties.Here follows a summary of the  
 children's questions and the answers  
 they received.                        
  You do not have to be born in        
 Tewkesbury to become town mayor,but   
 you must be of voting age and will be 
 elected by the town                   
 councillors.Equally you may be elected
 on more than one occasion.            
  Tewkesbury was a borough until 1974, 
 and because of charters granted by    
 Queen Elizabeth I,had a borough mayor.
 Since boundaries changes in that year 
 Tewkesbury gained a town mayor.       
  The mayor's official dress consists  
 of a robe of scarlet and ermine and a 
 gold chain of office which was        
 presented to the borough in 1878.
