 Hepscott is a village of houses,farms,
 a mineral railway and a parish hall.  
 There is a{post office}but it is in   
 someone's garage at one end of the    
 village.The Victorian post box is at  
 the other end.There are no{shops}or   
{inns}becauce a farmer owner who was a 
 Duchess of Carlisle made this rule.A  
 new housing astate,Field House Close  
 is named after Field House Farm.There 
 are no ponds or suitable places to    
 fish,but the Hepscott burn runs       
 through the village.The bridge over   
 this,near the farm may never be       
 repaired,as no seems to own it.A walk 
 through Hepscott takes about an hour. 
 Land is regularly sold for houses.At  
 one time croft's park was part of the 
 Croft and its garden.
