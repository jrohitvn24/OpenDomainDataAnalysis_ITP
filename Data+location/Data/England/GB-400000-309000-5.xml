		<title>05HOW CHILDREN DRESS IN 1985</title>
		<content>We went round the school to find out   
what children like to wear.We chose    
three girls and boys from each class   
class we asked them,"What colours suit 
you best?". Most children prefer blue  
then black then pink and grey then     
peach and red.Not many children chose  
green or yellow. Then we asked"Do you  
you like dark or light colour?" Most   
children preferred lighter colours.    
Then we asked  what skirts do girls    
like to wear.Most girls like to wear   
plain,then leather, then mini and      
long flowery and frilly.We asked,"What 
trouser's do you prefer to wear?"      
Children prefer to wear jeans, then    
tight trousers,and cotton then baggy.  
The last question was, "What shoes     
do you like to wear?" Children liked   
trainers best which is a canvas sports 
shoe with a non slip rubber sole.
