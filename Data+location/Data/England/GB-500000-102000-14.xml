		<title>14The River Arun-Littlehampton</title>
		<content> The River Arun works its way cutting  
 through the chalk rocks upon the South
 Downs towards the sea at              
 Littlehampton.The Arun is a           
 twisting,turning river and is very    
 tidal up to Pallingham.The River Arun 
 has cut its way through the Amberley  
 Downs and the River flows down to the 
 mouth at Littlehampton.The source of  
 the river is to be found near Horsham 
 in a place called Itchingfield.       
 The River Arun did not always have its
 mouth at Littlehampton however,it used
 to have a lagoon that stretched       
 eastwards towards Shoreham.Eventually 
 the river breached the lagoon and gave
 the river access at Littlehampton.The 
 river has been straightened(1735) and 
 has been deepened so more ships and   
 larger ships can use the river itself.
