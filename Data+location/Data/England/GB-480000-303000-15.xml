		<title>15Hunting in Leighfield</title>
		<content> Leighfield is in the centre of the    
 best hunting country of the Cottesmore
 Hunt,Priors Coppice (830055) and      
 Launde Park Wood (803038) being two of
 the most important fox coverts.       
 The objects of hunting are to cull    
 excess foxes and to provide sport.    
 Cubbing takes place in September and  
 October when the young hounds are     
 taught about hunting and the excess   
 cubs are culled by holding up the     
 covert and so confining the foxes and 
 hounds. The hunting season is from    
 November to March and the hunt goes   
 across Leighfield about once a        
 fortnight. The earths in the woods are
 stopped on the morning of the hunt to 
 keep the foxes above ground and       
 encourage them to run from one wood to
 another. Two new fox coverts have been
 planted close to the River Chater in  
 recent years.                         </content>
