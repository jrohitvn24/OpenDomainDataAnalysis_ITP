		<title>04TOURISM in Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   Although off the beaten track, there
 are many visitors to the area to see  
 both the village and the geological   
 outcrops, (Blindcrake's ancient name  
 was "top rock").                      
   1985 has been one of the wettest and
 coldest summers this century but the  
 two caravan sites attract people as   
 the outer fringes of the Lake District
 National Park grows in popularity.    
   Annual visitors are the gypsies with
 their horse drawn caravans who camp on
 the Ghyll Yeat pub field (opposite the
 pub) on their way home from Appleby   
 Fair. The pub has only one small room!
   Walks to Clints Crags and Sunderland
 returning via Isel are becoming very  
 popular for both visitors and locals. 
   There is no hotel or bed and break- 
 fast accomodation in the village but  
 there is a motel at Moota on the main 
 Carlisle to Cockermouth road.         </content>
