		<title>08Local Superstitions</title>
		<content> Many miners were superstitious. Miners
 would consider meeting a woman with a 
 squint or leaving something at home as
 signs of ill-omen and would not go to 
 work.  If a shaft was to be sunk a    
 sovereign would be placed on the lst  
 sod and thrown to the crowd.  On      
 "calling days" the miners' wives would
 place tongs on the mantlepiece or put 
 a cat in an unlit oven to ensure their
 men were allotted good jobs.  Miners  
 would not wash their back in case of  
 weakening them.  Fishermen would not  
 go to sea if they saw a pib on Friday,
 and the word 'pig' is unlucky.  The   
 ill-omen can be cancelled by making a 
 thumbs up gesture.  Every day         
 supersitions and customes include:not 
 leaving a house by the same door      
 unless a seat has been taken: not     
 putting new shoes on a table; placing 
 a poker on coals to encourage flames. </content>
