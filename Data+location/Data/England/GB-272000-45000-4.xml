		<title>04THE LANES</title>
		<content> Other than a few stretches of B class 
 roads that lead to Totnes or Plymouth,
 most of the travelling ways are Devon 
 lanes.                                
                                       
 They are typical of this part of Devon
 and are narrow;usually no more that 3 
 metres at their widest.Most are have  
 steep sided banks that are,in         
 summer,maybe 3 metres high with       
 growth.                               
                                       
 From early April they  begin to crowd 
 with growth.First the Primroses and   
 the Campions and then through the     
 summer a succession of foxgloves,     
 ferns, shrubs and grasses.            
 Luckily,farmers still value them and  
 the wildlife they shelter.            
                                       
 For cars there are worn passing places
 but locals learn how to reverse well. </content>
