		<content>{  }On 11th.June,1985 I got up at      
  7.00am washed,dressed,had breakfast  
  (cereal,toast,cup of tea).Next I gave
 some tripe and dog biscuits to our 5  
 Samoyed dogs.                         
    At 8.20am mum drove me 3 miles to  
 school where I played until           
 registration time at 8.55am I went to 
 school assembly and then did maths    
 until playtime at 10.30am .I had my   
 dinner at school                      
 (turkey,stuffing,cauliflower,potatoes,
 gravy and cake). Playtime in the      
 afternoon was at 2.30pm. Mum collected
 me from school at 3.40pm and took me  
 for a haircut.                        
   Back at home I chopped wood, had    
 tea, made a wooden sword and          
 shield,played my electronic organ then
 had supper,watched television and went
 to bed at 8.00pm.
