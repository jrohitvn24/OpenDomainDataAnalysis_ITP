 garage.The house has three bedrooms , 
 one bathroom and a loft.Downstairs we 
 have a large livingroom witha dinning 
 area at the end of the room.The       
 kitchen is very small.In the back yard
 there are concrete flags and then a   
 large patch of grass.The front is     
 where the flowers are grown and       
 there is a lawn.We have a patio where 
 the dinning table is.The house is     
 about one and a quarter miles from the
 centre of Batley.                     
  The livingroon is all blue with a    
 blue settee and carpet and curtains.  
 The fire place is made out of stone   
 and cobbles and the fire is made out  
  of bronze. When we bought it ,it cost
                                       
 Â£18,000 nearly two years ago.The doors
 are white and the side doors are blue.
