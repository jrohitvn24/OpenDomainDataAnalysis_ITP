		<title>10PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  There is not a very good public      
 transport system through this area.   
 The railway line was closed about     
 twenty years ago, and the track is now
 a grass-covered ride along the West   
 edge of our area. There are some      
 buses, but they are not frequent and  
 people say they are not very reliable.
 Most people who do not work on local  
 farms work in Cirencester, Swindon    
 or Cheltenham and travel to work by   
 car.Most families have at least one.
