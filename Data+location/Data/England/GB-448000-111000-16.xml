		<title>16TRAFFIC IN BOTLEY.</title>
		<content>   One of the main problems with Botley
 is the traffic.Lots of lorries go     
 through Botley and it gets congested  
 very quickly.It is very difficult for 
 people to cross the roads in Botley   
 because there are cars parked in every
 parking space.People in Botley would  
 like a zebra crossing but the council 
 will only put in a crossing from      
 pavement to pavement.Unfortunately the
 look of the  square would be spoilt if
 pavements were added to it.           
  People in Botley were at first       
 against the Farm museum being sited   
 there because of the extra traffic    
 this would bring to the village.Cars  
 were however routed through Hamble    
 Country Park and opinions have changed
 so that there is now a society of     
 friends of the museum in Botley.
