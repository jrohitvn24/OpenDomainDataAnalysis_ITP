		<content> When we looked at the old School      
 Admission Register we noticed that    
 most of the children in the school    
 came from families who worked on      
 farms.Nowadays there are few people   
 who actually work on the farms around 
 here although we are told that the    
 farms look better than they have ever 
 done.This is because of the machinery 
 which the farmers now use.Very often  
 just a farmer and his wife will look  
 after the farm all on their own.Most  
 farmers here keep Friesian cows.They  
 live on silage in the winter which    
 they make during the summer when the  
 cows can live in the fields.Most of   
 the cows now wear computer collars so 
 that their details are checked        
 carefully.There are a lot of Chicken  
 sheds around here.These are all run by
 Tiverton Poultry Group.
