		<title>17Schooling in Marton</title>
		<content> Our school is called Our Lady's.It is 
 in the nearby village of Princethorpe 
 and there are about 100 children with 
 four teachers.We can borrow two books 
 from the school library.Some of us    
 come to school in a bus and this year 
 we went by bus on outings to Drayton  
 Manor Park and Iron Bridge Gorge      
 Museum.We sit on the floor for        
 Assembly and some of us read at       
 Assembly.We went to St Gregory's      
 Coventry for the Inter School Sports: 
 we lost the trophy this year.We cook  
 jam tarts and then take them home.    
 I like school.
