In Chesterton all the schools begin at 
9.00a.m.   There are three schools in  
Chesterton - Chesterton High,          
Chesterton Primary and Nursery and     
Churchfields Primary, Infants and      
Nursery.   There is a Baths at the High
School and both Primary Schools use it 
for swimming lessons.   The Primary    
Schools have different break and lunch 
times.   At dinner time the pupils have
a choice whether to go home, bring     
sandwiches or have a cooked meal at    
school for which they pay.   Each half 
of the school day starts with taking   
the register.  At the High School we   
change rooms for lessons but at the    
Primary Schools the pupils stay in the 
same classrooms.   Our Headmaster is   
very strict but always fair.   You     
don't get much punishment the first    
time you do something wrong.           </content>
