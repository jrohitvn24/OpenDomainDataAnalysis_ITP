		<content> Hilton Grange Farm is owned by the    
{National Childrens Home}and is on the 
 top of the ridge which divides        
{Airedale and Wharfedale}.It is a dairy
 farm and covers 270 acres.Over 200    
 animals are kept and the milking herd 
 numbers 120.A lorry comes each day at 
 about 2 pm and takes away 1500 litres 
 of milk.The herd are Holsteins and    
 the average{lactation}of the herd is  
 1400 gallons{.Canadian Holstein Bulls 
 are being used to try to raise the    
 butterfat level which is just under 4%
 and also to raise the  herd's average 
 yield.In the summer the cows are      
 outside but in October they come in   
 and eat silage which is cut from 115  
 acres of grass-land.Five acres of hay 
 are made for the small calves.The farm
 is run by a farm manager and two      
 labourers and older pupils from Hilton
 Grange School.{CHERYL GIBSON.         </content>
