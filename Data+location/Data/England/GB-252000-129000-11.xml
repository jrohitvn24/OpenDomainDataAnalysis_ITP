		<title>11BYWAY'S COTTAGE</title>
		<content>         {BYWAYS COTTAGE}              
                                       
 Byways cottage was built approximately
 in 1760. The cottage has been built in
 two parts, the oldest part in 1760 and
 the other part is unknown when it was 
 built. We think Byways cottage is in  
 two parts because one of the walls is 
 very thick like an outside wall with a
 doorjam. The opposite side of that    
 wall is at a different level of       
 height.                               
 Inside the old and building there are 
 completely different fireplaces from  
 times set far apart. The services     
 Byways cottage enjoy are: mains water 
 electricity, and telephone but no     
 gas or sewerage which means that all  
 cottages in that area have a septic   
 tank of their own.
