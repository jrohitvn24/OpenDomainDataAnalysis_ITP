		<content>Farnborough is a small village.It is   
bounded by the A21 to the North,and    
Green Belt land to the south.It has one
main street.The shops were built in    
1910.                                  
The oldest part of Farnborough is      
around the triangle in Church Road.The 
houses here are 200-400 years old.     
There is an antique shop and a violin  
shop where the old village shops used  
to be.                                 
The first big development was in 1907  
when the roads named after saints were 
built.More houses are being built all  
the time.                              
There are two pubs,the Woodman and the 
Change of Horses.The George used to be 
a pub but it is now a restaurant.      
There is a laundry,a small electronics 
firm,a telephone exchange and a        
research centre.
