		<content> All children begin school before      
 they are 5, and there are two primary 
 schools in this area. At{Barrow}is a  
 little country school with{55 children
 and{3 teachers.}In{Broseley}there are 
 two schools, but only 1 in this area. 
 It is in Dark Lane, and has{280       
{children and 11 teachers.}The school  
 at Barrow was founded in 1612 by John 
 Slaney, and is now in buildings dating
 from 1890 and l972. Broseley CE School
 was rebuilt in 1969.                  
                                       
 Children leave these schools when they
 are 11, and most of them go to the    
{William Brookes comprehensive school  
 in Much Wenlock. A few go to schools  
 in{Bridgnorth}or{Telford}instead.
