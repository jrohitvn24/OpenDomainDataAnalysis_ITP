		<content>   Where Toad Lane Museum stands is the
 site of the world's first successful  
 co-op. The building opened in 1790 as 
 a warehouse but on the 21st December  
 1844, the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers 
 Society opened it as a co-operative   
 store. It sold goods cheaper than     
 local shops eg. sugar, flour, butter  
 etc.                                  
   It is now open as a museum and      
 depicts how the shop used to be. The  
 museum has been restored to a 19th    
 Century setting.                      
   Sparrow Hill Museum is a listed     
 building (1725) and was first used as 
 a vicarage for St Chad's Church. It   
 houses local artefacts. Also, several 
 rooms recreate life in the past eg. a 
 Victorian child's bedroom; a Clogging 
 shop; a 19th Century pub.
