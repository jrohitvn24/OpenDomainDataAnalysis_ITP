		<title>07Education in Swindon</title>
		<content>In Swindon we have a small modern      
primary school.It has the same name as 
the church,St.John's.Just over a       
hundred children attend the school.The 
youngest are nearly five and they are  
in Mrs Humphrey's class.Mrs.Jones      
teaches the older infants.When they are
juniors they go into Mr.Beaumont's     
class.Mr.Griffiths,who is the          
headmaster takes the top class.The     
children in this class are between 10  
and 11.Mrs.Brown teaches some of the   
time and Mrs.Ryan looks after us if we 
are poorly.Mrs.Robinson cooks the      
dinners.Lots of children stay to       
dinners or sandwiches.Mrs.Butler is the
secretary.It is a good school.         
When children leave this school they   
go to Edgecliffe High School which is  
at Kinver.The children travel to Kinver
on a coach which is provided by        
Staffordshire.                         </content>
