		<title>18CATTLE FARMING NEAR YANWORTH</title>
		<content>     The main breeds  are {Welsh  Black
{or  Blue-Grey  crossed   with   either
{Charolais, Limousin or Hereford bulls.
     The emphasis is on{beef}_ there is
 insufficient rainfall to give adequate
 top quality grass for dairying.Some of
 the pasture is managed  or sown grass,
 the rest is permanent pasture.    With
 farmers travelling more, the influence
 of farming  publications,  research in
 farming  colleges,  government  policy
 and  public demand  _  the result  has
 been{new breeding policies. }These are
 aimed  at getting better animal growth
 rates,  better meat yield  and  a  new
 generally superior animal.    This has
 left the  traditional Hereford  rather
 outclassed  and{resulted in new breeds
{from Europe appearing in the fields.  
     Most  calves are 'finished' on the
 estate but some are finished elsewhere
 _  after being sold at Banbury market.</content>
