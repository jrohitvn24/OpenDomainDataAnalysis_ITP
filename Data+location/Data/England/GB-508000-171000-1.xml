		<content> Feltham is situated on the western    
 outskirts of London. It lies between  
 the M3 and M4 motorways and is built  
 on the gently rolling land of the     
 London Basin.Its importance throughout
 the ages has been dependant upon      
 communications; primarily with the    
 'Coaching Roads'and then with the     
 Flying Air Ships (Hanworth Air Park); 
 a large Railway Terminal (once one of 
 if not the largest in Europe) and more
 recently its trade and industry is    
 very closely linked with Heathrow     
 Airport.                              
 The area surrounding Feltham has had  
 other facets of economic and          
 Historical importance such as numerous
 sand and gravel pits which are now    
 reservoirs and Tudor Court which dates
 back to Henry viii.
