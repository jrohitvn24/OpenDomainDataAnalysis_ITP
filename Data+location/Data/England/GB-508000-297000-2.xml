		<title>02STIBBINGTON AND SUTTON</title>
		<content>  The village of{Stibbington}consists  
 of approximately sixty dwellings.  The
 houses are generally located along a  
 single road.  The houses vary in size 
 and style.  In the centre of the      
 village there is an old, large house  
 called Stibbington Hall.  The oldest  
 part of the village lies around the   
 church whilst the newer part is near  
 to the A1 road, where some council    
 houses have been built.  The Field    
 Studies Centre is also near the A1.   
  Stibbington village is separated from
 its neighbour, Sutton by the River    
 Nene.                                 
{ Sutton}is a tiny village consisting  
 of a church and a collection of mostly
 old and expensive houses.  Like most  
 other villages in this area it has few
 facilities.  The village is very quiet
 since access to it is by a minor road 
 off the A47.                          </content>
