		<content>    In Hayes there are a lot of things 
 to do in your spare time.  Scouts, Cub
 Scouts, Beavers, Girl Guides,         
 Brownies, Boys Brigade, Chess Club,   
 Hayes Players Drama Club, Tennis Club 
 and Badminton Club. Hayes Primary     
 visited the Squash Club which has over
 2000 members and about one-third come 
 every week.  They have 16 indoor      
 courts. Open every day except Bank    
 Holidays, they also play racket ball, 
 snooker and pool.  It costs Â£84 a     
 person or Â£126 a family plus the cost 
 per session.  They also have a bar.   
    Hayes Common is an area for        
 recreation now, but used to be used   
 for grazing cattle and pigs and for   
 collecting berries and wood.  The     
 green area surrounded by trees on     
 three sides is used in the summer for 
 village activities, this includes the 
 May Day celebration.                  </content>
