		<title>04FRUIT FARMING IN PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content> I live on a fruit farm in Nutbourne.We
 grow strawberries, raspberries,       
 loganberries, also blackberries,      
 gooseberries, red and white currants. 
 Rhubarb is the easiest crop to grow   
 but apples grow very well too. In     
 summer the farm is open every day from
 9am to 6pm for people to pick their   
 fruit.The farm has 11 fields. Most of 
 the summer we are busy, but the       
 busiest time of year of all is the    
 early Autumn.                         
         THE GARDEN CENTRE             
 We went to a Garden Centre near our   
 school which is open from 9.00am to   
 5.30pm every day. They sell many      
 plants and lots of different kinds of 
 composts. Begonias and Busy Lizzies   
 are the best selling type of flowers. 
 Pulborough people are very keen on    
 their gardens.
