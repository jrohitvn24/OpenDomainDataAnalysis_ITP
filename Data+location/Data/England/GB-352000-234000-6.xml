		<title>06WILCOX AND SONS 1</title>
		<content> Mr Wilcox has got a firm at Holme     
 Lacy.   Apart from two brothers who   
 have a joinery business in one of his 
 sheds, it is the{only business in the 
{village.  }It is a precision          
 engineering firm, which mainly{designs
{and makes machinery for sawmills.     
 Because of the{coal miners' strike,   
 the sawmills have been short of       
 business and some have closed, so Mr  
 Wilcox does a lot of work designing   
 and making machinery for anyone who   
 gives him the orders.   When we       
 visited his works, they were making   
 cogs for a printing firm in London.   
 Some of the machines were quite old,  
 but most of them are{very modern -    
 such as a laser cutter for cutting out
 shapes from flat metal.   Like most of
 his modern equipment, it is{controlled
{by computer.
