		<content> WE INTERVIEWED AS MANY LOCAL PEOPLE AS
 POSSIBLE WHO WERE OF A SUITABLE AGE   
 AND ASKED HOW THINGS HAD CHANGED SINCE
 THE SECOND WORLD WAR.MANY REMEMBERED  
 WHEN THE BOMBS WERE DROPPING AND WHEN 
 ENEMY PLANES WERE FLYING OVER.ONE     
 PERSON TOLD US HOW THE PLANT WORKS    
 CAUGHT FIRE.                          
 MOST PEOPLE USED TO SPEND THEIR TIME  
 DOING KNITTING AND SEWING AND IN THIS 
 RESPECT THINGS ARE MUCH THE SAME NOW. 
 EVERYBODY HAD RATION BOOKS AND        
 CLOTHING COUPONS.WHEN THEY RAN OUT    
 PEOPLE WOULD WAIT FOR NEW ONES OR BUY 
 THEM FROM OTHER PEOPLE.               
 MOST PEOPLE WE INTERVIEWED HAVE LIVED 
 IN DONCASTER FOR MANY YEARS.THE       
 HOUSING CONDITIONS ARE NOW MUCH BETTER
 AND MORE CONVENIENT.THEY NOW HAVE     
 CENTRAL HEATING,GAS FIRES,WASHING     
 MACHINES,REFRIGERATORS,TELEPHONES,    
 TELEVISIONS,VIDEOS AND COMPUTERS.     </content>
