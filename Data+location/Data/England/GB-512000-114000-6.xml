 One of the games we play at school is 
 called 'Hey,Mr Crocodile'. One person 
 stands about 5 metres away from the   
 other people who chant "Hey,Mr        
 Crocodile, May we cross the water, To 
 see your ugly daughter, Just like     
 you." And Mr Crocodile answers "Only  
 if you're wearing..." And he says a   
 colour and anyone wearing that colour 
 can go across to the other side - all 
 the others have to try to cross and   
 the person who is caught by Mr        
 Crocodile is 'on'.                    
{Our favourite games are:-
