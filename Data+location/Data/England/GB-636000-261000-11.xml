		<title>11A Visit to Mr Crisp</title>
		<content>Mr Crisp was born in Saxmundham in     
Crisps shop in 1908.He went to school  
opposite Saxmundham primary school.He  
could remember the main road before    
1914. In the winter the  main road was 
muddy and like a track . In the summer 
it was very dusty . He could remember  
when his well water was condemned and  
he had to go to the town square to     
fetch the water.He remembered both of  
the world wars.They cooked on stoves   
and they lit with wood and paper. He   
said there were fewer varieties of     
sweets when he was a boy.They could    
buy an amount of sweets with 1\2p but  
a mans wages were  2 pounds a week.Many
more people used bicycles and he       
remembers the days of the horse and    
trap.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
