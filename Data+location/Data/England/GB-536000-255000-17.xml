		<title>17THE VILLAGE COLLEGE</title>
		<content>   The village college is attended by  
 nearly 1000 pupils ranging from 11 to 
 16 years. But, it is not just         
 schoolchildren that use the college   
 facilities, many other people from the
 community use it for a variety of     
 things. For example: Squash, Tennis,  
 Keep Fit, Typing, and evening classes 
 for parents.                          
   The college was founded by Mr Henry 
 Morris who, over sixty years ago was  
 Chief Education Officer for           
 Cambridgeshire.                       
   This year (1985) we celebrate our   
 Silver Jubilee anniversary, and have  
 been visited by the Duke of Edinburgh 
 and Sir Keith Joseph who is the       
 Secretary of Education. We have a star
 amoung us. Mr Wallin, a science       
 teacher, appeared on the BBC's 'Beat  
 the Teacher' quiz show, and is the    
 Champion of Champions..!              </content>
