		<content>     St. Peter's Church, Wrestlingworth
 was built in the 12th century. It is  
 built on a hill and can be seen for   
 miles around. It is built from flint  
 and local stone. Unfortunately it     
 needs repairs urgently. The village   
 hopes to raise Â£24,000 for repairs to 
 the roof and tower which is crumbling 
 away. John Wesley once preached in the
 church. He reproached the             
 congregation for their sins so much,  
 that fifteen of them fainted. The     
 church has a lepers window where      
 lepers could receive Communion from   
 outside the church. A stone window has
 graffiti, done by a crusador.
