		<content> The main centres of population of this
 block are the villages of Winterbourne
 Frampton Cotterell and Coalpit Heath  
 situated a few miles to the north east
 of Bristol close to the M4 motorway.  
 Originally employment in the area     
 centred upon agriculture whilst later 
 quarrying, hatting and the mining of  
 both coal and iron played their part  
 in the local economy. Today the old   
 industries have disappeared but market
 gardening and farming are still       
 important, the former taking advantage
 of the rich red marl of which much of 
 the area is composed. Whilst the      
 region is still largely rural in      
 nature the villages have expanded to  
 become large residential centres with 
 many local people working in Bristol  
 or in the aircraft and aerospace      
 industries at Filton.
