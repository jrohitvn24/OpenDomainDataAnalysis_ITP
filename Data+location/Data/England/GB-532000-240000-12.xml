		<title>12Royston Fire Station</title>
		<content>   Royston has a modern fire station.  
 There are two engines, an old one and 
 a new one. Each engine acts as a large
 pump to pump water at 1000 gallons a  
 minute .Each engine is bright red with
 a flashing blue lamp and a siren .The 
 engines carry all sorts of equipment, 
 hoses, ladders, a spare pump, tools,  
 ropes, breathing apparatus and much   
 else.Royston's firemen wear yellow    
 helmets and trousers and a black      
 duffel coat and boots.                
   The firemen put out different kinds 
 of fires, houses,grass, chemicals and 
 road accidents.They do many other     
 jobs,such as rescuing people,draining 
 ponds and helping at car crashes.     
  Every day they check the fire        
 engines.They wash them down and check 
 that there's enough water and diesel  
 fuel and they drill every day too.
