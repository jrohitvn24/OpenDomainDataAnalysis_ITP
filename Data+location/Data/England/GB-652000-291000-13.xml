 We are helping to clean up Kirkley Ham
&amp; make it into a home for nature.      
 People have been using The Ham as a   
rubbish dump. It was very marshy &amp;     
muddy so I had to wear my old clothes &amp;
wellingtons. I had a bag to put the    
rubbish in. We found crisp packets,    
buckets, a bed spring &amp; part of a car  
engine. There were 3 railway signs, a  
train lamp &amp; 2 doors because trains    
used to run over The Ham. We stacked   
the big bits into a pile &amp; someone     
took a photo of us for the paper. Then 
we had a drink of orange.              
 Some of the flowers that grow on The  
Ham are Lupin, Clover, Willowherb &amp;    
Flag. The stream is very polluted but  
we found a newt, some snails and       
tadpoles. Emma saw a rat &amp; we saw some 
blue-tits. In the reeds Jenny found a  
mallard's nest with eggs in it.        </content>
