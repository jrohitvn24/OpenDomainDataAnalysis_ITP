		<title>14HOUSING - THREE MOSSES</title>
		<content> The housing in the Three Mosses area  
 can be defined as farms, bungalows,   
 houses and flats.  The properties     
 along the moss roads are mainly farms,
 converted farmbuildings, houses and   
 individually deisgned bungalows.In    
 Haskayne village the houses and       
 bungalows were designed many years ago
 as a housing development, and are     
 therefore of a very similar design.The
 four flats over the shops in Haskayne 
 are used by the shopkeeper as         
 accommodation or as extra storage for 
 the shop. Most of the homes in this   
 area are privately owned.  There are  
 no slum areas or any clearances here. 
 The two ancient houses are completely 
 different to anything else in this    
 area and are also privately owned.
