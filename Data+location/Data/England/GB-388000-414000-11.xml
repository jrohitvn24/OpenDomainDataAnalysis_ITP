		<title>11ALICE INGHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Alice Ingham School was opened in     
 Sept. 1974 to accomodate children from
 this area.When the school was built,  
 nobody knew what to call it, until one
 day the priest said that they had a   
 saint on their doorstep. She was      
 called Alice Ingham.She had lived in  
 Rochdale all her life so she was an   
 obvious choice.Alice Ingham was born  
 in 1830 and died in 1890 at the age of
 60.During her life she had contributed
 in many ways to the parish and never  
 tired of helping the community.       
 Children start the school at the age  
 of 5 and leave when they are 10.There 
 are three classes in the  Infants and 
 three classes in the Juniors.When the 
 school was built there was no library 
 so they built their own. It is a small
 school but there is lots of area to   
 play.
