		<content>  Jen Cleave said that changes in      
 Kilkhampton have been on the          
 farms.Some changes have been cutting  
 out hedgerows &amp; some woods have been  
 cut down.Jen told me that there is no 
 effect after some people drain the    
 land.Mrs Cleave said that silage kills
 fish &amp; sheep if it leaks into the     
 water.                                
  Wendy Vanstone moved into a new house
 "Marwood",at Christmas 1984.She said  
 that some farmers cut down hedgerows  
 to get bigger fields.Wendy said that  
 when they drain some bogs there is no 
 after mess.Afterwards Mrs Vanstone    
 said to me that silage sometimes      
 poisons the water if it leaks.Also if 
 you dip sheep in a river that is      
 poisoned it kills the sheep &amp; all the 
 fish.
