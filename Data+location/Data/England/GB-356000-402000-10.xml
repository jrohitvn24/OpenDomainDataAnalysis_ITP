		<title>10St. James' Church, Wigan</title>
		<content>Named after James Eckersley, the local 
mill owner, not St. James, the church  
has been a landmark on the Poolstock   
skyline for about 120 years. Its walls 
are built from local Parbold Stone and 
are 4 feet thick. A beautiful stone    
reredos at the front of the church was 
commissioned by Lady Eckersley when she
saw one like it in a French church. It 
is of the 12 apostles with St. Matthias
replacing Judas. The lectern, a large  
brass eagle, can't be insured as we no 
longer have the craftsmen to replace   
it. When the church first opened a peal
of 8 bells summoned mill workers to    
church. Now many houses have been dem- 
olished and so congregations are       
smaller. In 1970 nearby St. Thomas'    
Church was demolished and the two      
parishes were joined. Our church is now
called St. James with St. Thomas.      
Base 8, St. James' School.             </content>
