		<title>08ACKTON HALL COLLIERY</title>
		<content> Ackton Hall Colliery is situated      
 amongst open fields near Featherstone.
 The first shafts were sunk in 1877 in 
 order to get men to the coal face more
 quickly but coal was still brought to 
 the workings at Featherstone.         
   The pit had many different owners   
 before being taken over by the NCB in 
 1947. In 1966 a major reconstruction  
 programme took place and further major
 improvement took place in 1976 as the 
 old coal seam was worked out.         
   The colliery has had a good working 
 life but is due for closure in July   
 1985. During the 1984/85 miners strike
 3 underground fires cost the NCB      
 Â£7.million destroying the Barnsley bed
 seams. Even before the dispute the pit
 was due for closure as 12000 tonnes of
 material had to be brought to the     
 surface in order to get 6000 tonnes of
 coal.                                 </content>
