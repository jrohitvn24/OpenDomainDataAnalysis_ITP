 The Denton Day Centre is a club for   
 elderly and handicapped people.This   
 club is held every Wednesday from 10  
 a.m. until 3 p.m. in Methwold village 
 hall.The club is organised by a       
 committee and is run by seven         
 voluntary helpers .                   
     During the morning the members are
 involved in a variety of handicrafts, 
 i.e. basket work, weaving, sewing and 
 knitting. Their lunch is brought from 
 the High School where it is cooked in 
 the school canteen, and then in the   
 afternoon they play card games or     
 bingo, and sometimes they are         
 entertained by other groups in the    
 village.                              
      Members are brought to the club  
 by car from the villages of Northwold,
 Hockwold, Feltwell, Weeting and Stoke 
 Ferry.                                </content>
