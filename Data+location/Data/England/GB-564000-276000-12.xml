		<title>12 THE VILLAGE SHOP - WEST ROW</title>
		<content>                                       
    IN AN AGE WHEN SMALL VILLAGE SHOPS 
ARE BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST DUE TO
THE COMPETITION FROM SUPERMARKETS, WEST
ROW IS FORTUNATE IN RETAINING ITS SHOP.
    SITUATED NOT FAR FROM THE PRIMARY  
SCHOOL, IT IS REGULARLY VISITED BY THE 
CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHERS DURING TERM 
TIME ALTHOUGH THERE IS VERY LITTLE     
PASSING TRADE, WEST ROW BEING SOMEWHAT 
AWAY FROM THE MAIN ROADS.              
    THE PROPRIETOR'S AIM IS TO KEEP THE
REGULAR CUSTOMERS HAPPY. EVERY FRIDAY  
THEIR WEEKLY ORDERS ARE DELIVERED ROUND
THE VILLAGE AND INTO THE FEN.          
    AT FIRST GLANCE THE SHOP SEEMS TO  
SELL ALMOST EVERYTHING. ON ITS SHELVES 
ARE MOST GROCERY ITEMS, VEGETABLES AND 
FRUIT, CIGARETTES AND SWEETS, STOCKINGS
AND ICE-CREAM. IF YOU NEED A BIRTHDAY  
CARD, A HEADACHE PILL OR SOME PARAFFIN,
YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!             </content>
