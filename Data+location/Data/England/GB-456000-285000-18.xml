		<title>18CHURCH IN GILMORTON</title>
		<content> There has been a church in Gilmorton  
 since Saxon times and certain Saxon   
 stonework has been incorporated into  
 the tower. The church was rebuilt in  
 1861, the Saxon church having fallen  
 into disrepair. The record of rectors 
 starts in 1209. The church was        
 enriched when Edmund Jackson was      
 rector in the late 19th century. Much 
 of the glass given then is by Kemp, as
 is the marble reredos of the Last     
 Supper. The oldest gravestone is of   
 Randolph Woodcock, dated 1708. There  
 is a long record of churchwardens     
 showing the predominant families in   
 the village. The east gate in the     
 churchyard was donated by the Bloxsons
 who were associated with Gilmorton    
 from the 16th century to 1930.
