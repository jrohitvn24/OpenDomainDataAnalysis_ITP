		<content>{SIMON TAGG,}a 12_yr_old Chessington   
 schoolboy, describes some aspects of  
 his life in{1985}...                  
{         MY FAVOURITE LESSON          
 I like pottery, because I don't have  
 to do much writing. The teacher is    
 friendly, &amp; not too strict.  We make  
 clay models, glaze them, &amp; fire them  
 in the classroom kiln.                
         {MY CHOICE OF CAREER          
 Carpentry appeals to me. I enjoy      
 working with wood in my craft/design  
 lessons.  I'd like to make furniture  
 for a living.                         
{         MY DEAREST POSSESSION:}      
 I'm very fond of my pet budgie,       
 Neville.  It's my task to go down to  
 the shops to buy seed, millet, grit   
 &amp;c. For a special treat, I sometimes  
 use my pocket money to buy cage toys  
 for him.                              
                                       </content>
