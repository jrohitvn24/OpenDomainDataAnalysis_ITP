		<title>09Arts and Crafts - Local</title>
		<content> This area has a wide interest in      
 country crafts.                       
                                       
 Two important farm crafts are sheep   
 shearing and ploughing. Ploughing     
 matches are held with different       
 classes for various types of ploughs  
 and become very competitive. At the   
 annual County rally the Young Farmers 
 enter the sheep shearing contests.    
                                       
 The Young Farmers also hold local     
 competitions which include woodwork,  
 stock - judging, poultry trussing,    
 cookery, needlework and flower        
 arranging.                            
                                       
 The spectrum is also widened with the 
 author who writes for the BBC, a wood 
 carver an artist and an embroidress   
 who helps with the needlework in      
 Hereford Cathedral.                   </content>
