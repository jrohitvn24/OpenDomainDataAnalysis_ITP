		<title>01LANDSCAPE CUBERT/HOLYWELL</title>
		<content> The ancient parish of Cubert is       
 situated on a rise of a gently rolling
 landscape.  From the church there are 
 commanding views to the south of      
 Penhale Sands, an extensive area of   
 sand dunes largely occupied by Penhale
 Army Training Camp.  To the west lies 
 Holywell Bay with its magnificent     
 beach and associated tourist          
 attactions which makes this a most    
 popular area for summer holiday       
 makers.                               
                                       
 The National Trust owns an area of    
 2000 acres to the north known as      
 Cubert Common.  The remaining land is 
 farmed.  In the last 10 years there   
 has been considerable housing         
 development.  A new extension to the  
 school was opened in l977 and in l98l 
 a new village hall was built.
