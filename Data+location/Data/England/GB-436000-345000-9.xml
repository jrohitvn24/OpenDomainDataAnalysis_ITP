		<title>09KILBURN(DERBY)AREA EDUCATION</title>
		<content> Our area takes in the easten edge of  
 the Belper area for education. This is
 the only area of Derbyshire which     
 altered its system of the schooling to
 that auggested by the Plowden Report  
 of the late 1960's. This system,      
 incorpating first, middle and High    
 schools, which meant children changing
 school at 9 and 13, is being abandoned
 from September 1986 in favour of the  
 return to the more common Infant,     
 Junior and comprehisive Schools with  
 tranfer at 7 and 11. The remainder of 
 the the schools in our area operate   
 under that system already. These      
 include one of the best schools in the
 country, John Flamsteed School at     
 Denby, whose school population is less
 than 400. this is served by three     
 primary schools, two of which are just
 outside our area, and kilburn Junior  
 School.                               </content>
