		<title>07Employment in Garton</title>
		<content> A questionnaire revealed, as expected,
 that the main source of employment is 
 farming or jobs related to farming.The
 large, highly mechanised farms in the 
 area employ very few people apart     
 from the farmer and his family.For    
 instance an arable farm of 560 acres  
 employs only three men.               
 The present economic difficulties in  
 the country have had little effect as 
 only 2 people are unemployed, i.e.    
 among the people who answered the     
 questionnaire.                        
 A few people are self-employed:- three
 builders,a joiner,a stress welder and 
 a precision tool maker.The great      
 majority of people are manual         
 workers.About 12% could be described  
 professional or white collar workers  
 and 28% are retired.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
