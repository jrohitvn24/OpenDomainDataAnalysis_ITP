		<title>01Area to the East of Ulpha</title>
		<content> The area is mostly high fell, little  
 population and scattered farms which  
 employ most of the population. To the 
 West is the Duddon Valley flat        
 bottomed and steep sided containing   
 farms with good hay pasture in the    
 bottom and on the lower slopes rising 
 Eastwards to rough enclosed pasture   
 and then to open moor on the tops.    
 East and West is divided by the Ridge 
 of Brown Haw and Stickle Pike to the  
 East of which lie a few farms some    
 with good pasture but mainly poor.    
 There is some forestry activity to the
 East of Stephenson and Carter Ground  
 Farms. Public transport is restricted 
 to the Post Bus carrying passengers as
 well as mail morning and evening      
 Monday to Friday, evenings only       
 Saturday. Some of the cottages and    
 farms have been converted to holiday  
 homes.                                </content>
