		<content> Redlynch probably means "red clay".   
 The area now known as Redlynch is     
 identified on early maps as East      
 Downton.The field opposite the school 
 was the site of the village green,    
 called Warminster Green until it      
 became subject to an enclosure act.   
   Earlier this century much of the    
 village population worked on the      
 Newhouse and Hamptworth Lodge estates 
 as domestic staff, coachmen, grooms,  
 gardeners, woodmen and copsers.       
   In the village were several besom   
 makers, making both heather and birch 
 brooms. Bessomer Drove was the home of
 some of the besom makers.             
   Faggot tying provided work mainly   
 for women.The faggots were delivered  
 to bakers and  private homes.         
   Farm labourers worked long hours    
 some travelling as far as Chichester  
 for the harvest and sleeping in barns.</content>
