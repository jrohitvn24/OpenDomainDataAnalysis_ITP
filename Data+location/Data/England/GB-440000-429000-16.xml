		<content> Lessons were maths, handwriting,      
 history, geography, nature and        
 scripture. School could be started at 
 3 years old and pupils left at 14.    
 Discipline was strict and the cane was
 used for punishment.                  
 For medical treatment people often had
 their own medicines and cures which   
 were kept in their own homes. The     
 disease that people dreaded most was  
 Tuberculosis as this could not be     
 cured. People remember epidemics of   
 whooping cough and scarlet fever.     
 There was a local Fever Hospital at   
 Garforth Cliff. Medicine and treatment
 was not free and there were a few     
 tablets. Medicine was 6d per bottle.  
 For leisure people often went to the  
 cinema. Films were 2 or 3 years old by
 the time Kippax cinema showed them.   
 Entrance fee was 1d for the morning   
 and 3d in the evening.                </content>
