		<title>04 TUNSTEAD QUARRY TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>                                       
    Transport is very important at the 
 quarry.There are many different sorts 
 of vehicles there.This includes       
 transport inside and outside of the   
 quarry.Inside the quarry,when the     
 rock has been quarried,a vehicle      
 called a {shovel}picks up the         
 limestone and puts it into a {dumper  
{truck.}A dumpertruck is 20ft in       
 length, 15ft in height and can carry a
 load of 50 tons at a time.            
     A dumper carries the stone        
 to the {crusher.}After the stone has  
 gone through all the process,it goes  
 to a special loading place on the {   
{railway line,}which runs up the side  
 of the quarry.Before the railway line 
 was around,horse drawn carts          
 distributed the rock to its           
 destination.Now,{lorries}take the     
 stone to its destination.             </content>
