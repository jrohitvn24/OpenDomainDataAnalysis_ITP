{Squash Centre,}&amp; {Stanborough Sailing 
{Lakes. }The Stadium caters for all    
 popular sports,has a dry ski slope &amp; a
 banked cycle track.The close links    
 with cycling are reflected by the fact
 that a stage of the {Milk Race }      
 finishes in the town centre. The      
 Squash Centre has snooker &amp;           
 table-tennis tables. The Stanborough
