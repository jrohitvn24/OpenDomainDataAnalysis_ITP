		<content> that they liked the lessons,          
 particulary using the computer. Also  
 their friends were nice and kind.     
 They thought it was good because it   
 was a small school and there are not  
 too many classrooms to get confused   
 with. Also they liked the teachers and
 the outings. They enjoy swimming and  
 music in which they could sing many   
 different songs and play instruments.
