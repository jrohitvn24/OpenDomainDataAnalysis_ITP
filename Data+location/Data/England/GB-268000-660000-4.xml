		<title>04Housing in Viewpark district</title>
		<content>        Viewpark has more council      
houses than Uddingston. Most of those  
in Viewpark are in blocks of 4,6,or 8  
houses. Each block has 'closes' which  
are like tunnels going through the     
block so you can get through to the    
back garden. Most of the council houses
have between two and five apartments;a 
few have six. There are some flats near
to the main road and these have no     
gardens although some tenants have     
allotments.                            
        There have been some private   
houses built in parts of Viewpark rec- 
ently but Uddinston has many more old  
ones. It has several old large and     
beautiful red-sandstone villas. There  
are also some blocks of terraced hous- 
es built with this stone too. Udding-  
ston and Viewpark have nice areas but  
some parts are rather shabby, neglec-  
ted and dirty looking.                 </content>
