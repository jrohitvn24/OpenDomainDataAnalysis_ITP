		<title>13Houses in Aston Clinton</title>
		<content>    Aston Clinton is a village         
 containing a mixture of old and       
 new houses. The old houses are        
 mainly on the main A.41 road and      
 turnings off into Brook Street        
 and Weston Road. Since 1970 much      
 of the farmland within the            
 village has been used for             
 housing.                              
    Aston Clinton is made up of small  
 estates of between 70 and 100 houses  
 mainly built between 1970-1985. These 
 houses are of two or four bedroom     
 properties. Buckland and Drayton      
 Beauchamp are small villages mainly of
 older houses and farms.               
    Aston Clinton has become a commuter
 village since it is is situated on the
 main A.41 and is three miles from     
 Aylesbury and Tring both of which     
 serve London by rail.
