		<title>04Knostrop Lane</title>
		<content>      We went down a lane where there  
 were a lot of bushes, trees and{weeds.
 Behind the trees there were fields;   
 then we saw the{Chemical works.}The   
 photography group took a few photos of
 us, then we walked on. The road was   
 rough and stony; it was also dusty. We
 then saw a sign saying "Private Road" 
 so we did not go to the{sewage works. 
 The only people we saw were going past
 in{cars, lorries and vans.            
      Knostrop Lane was also gravelly  
 and quiet. There was a lot of grass   
 and rubbish like tyres, old beds and a
 sofa in muddy bogs. At the{Chemical   
{works}we saw a lot of huts and        
 containers which may contain liquids. 
      The grass around was long, with  
{weeds}such as{daisies, buttercups,    
{Mother Dies and dog daisies.
