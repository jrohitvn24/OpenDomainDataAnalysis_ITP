		<title>18Verse about Wetton</title>
		<content>          {Wetton}                     
Wetton is near Alstonefield,           
It isn't very big, but the people who  
  live there can cope for themselves.  
It is within the parish of Ecton and a 
  hamlet by the Manifold.              
The co-ordinates for Wetton are 105555.
There is one carpark which is outside  
  the public house.                    
                                       
                                       
           Beautiful Garden            
The beautiful garden in its peace and  
  glory,                               
Somebody spent so long to make it what 
  it is,                               
Maybe there's something inside them    
  that keeps them going or just the joy
  of making something as glamourous as 
  that garden.                         
I only wish it could be mine.
