		<title>03A CONTRACT FARMER IN BALNE</title>
		<content>  WE WENT TO INTERVIEW Mr. ASQUITH WHO 
 IS A CONTRACT FARMER. A CONTRACT      
 FARMER'S JOB IS TO DO A SERVICE FOR   
 OTHER FARMERS USING HIS OWN MACHINERY 
 ON THEIR LAND. IT IS A PROFITABLE JOB 
 IF ENOUGH WORK IS AVAILABLE.          
  Mr. ASQUITH BECAME INTERESTED IN     
 CONTRACT FARMING WHEN HE WORKED FOR   
 HIS FATHER. HE STILL ENJOYS IT BECAUSE
 THE WORK VARIES SO MUCH. THERE IS NO  
 NEED TO ADVERTISE FOR WORK BECAUSE    
 FARMERS TALK TO OTHER FARMERS ABOUT   
 HIS EXPERTISE.                        
  THE MACHINES WHICH Mr. ASQUITH USES  
 ARE TRACTORS, COMBINE_HARVESTERS,     
 BALERS, GRASS_CUTTERS, HEDGE_CUTTERS, 
 SUGAR_BEET HARVESTERS, BEET DRILLS AND
 MANURE_SPREADERS, BUT THE MOST        
 VALUABLE OF ALL TO Mr. ASQUITH IS THE 
 LARGEST TRACTOR.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
