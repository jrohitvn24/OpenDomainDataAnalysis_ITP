		<title>10BRACK'S FARM</title>
		<content> Brack's farm is on the outskirts of   
 Bishop Auckland near Brack's wood. The
 house is from 150 to 200 years old.   
 About 70 years ago there was an       
 extension built on. It is made of     
 stone and the roof is of slates. There
 is a large garden at the front of the 
 house and a small orchard at the back.
 At the front of the house to one side 
 there is a disused garage. At the     
 other side there is a blacksmiths shop
 now used as a work shop. There is also
 a dairy where the milking equipment is
 kept. The people who lived there      
 before us were called the Snowdons. My
 family has lived in the house about 60
 years. In a few weeks we will have    
 some new buildings built.Our farm is a
 mixed farm this means we have cows    
 sheep and some arable (corn). Around  
 our house there are a lot of oak and  
 beech trees.                          </content>
