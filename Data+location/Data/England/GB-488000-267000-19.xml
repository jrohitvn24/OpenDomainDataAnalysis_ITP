		<title>19A FRENCHMANS TIME AT W'BORO</title>
		<content>   When you are appointed French       
 assistant in an English school,you    
 can't help thinking about all those   
 preconceived ideas foreigners have    
 about the English way of life.        
  As far as I am concerned,I have      
 really enjoyed the atmosphere at      
 Wellingborough school.First I grew    
 used to the quietness and simplicity  
 of the school-life and quickly under_ 
 stood that here,tradition remains the 
 keyword whatever you do.Then I found  
 out that English cooking is far much  
 better than expected.Fortunately,the  
 importance of games is such that a    
 regular training session prevented me 
 from putting on too much weight.I also
 learnt to appreciate the British sense
 of humour:special but interesting.I   
 wonder whether I shall find it easy   
 to readjust to the French way of life.
