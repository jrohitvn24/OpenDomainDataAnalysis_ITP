		<title>20The Auckland Homes</title>
		<content>  The{Auckland Homes}are situated along
 the western boundary of{Wearside      
{College.}Built during the latter part 
 of World War II with money sent over  
 by the{New Zealand Government,}they   
 first served as temporary homes for   
 bombed out people.                    
  When these people were all re-housed 
 they were given over to{elderly       
{retired folk.}In the centre of the    
 terrace is a communal building where  
 the inhabitants can meet to play      
 dominoes, cards etc. and where meals  
 can be brought to the at low cost.    
  It is run by the{Social Services}who 
 have installed alarm systems to all   
 the houses. Each system is connected  
 to the warden should any of the       
 elderly require assistance.
