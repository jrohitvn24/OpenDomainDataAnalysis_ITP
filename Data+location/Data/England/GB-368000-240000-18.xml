		<content> The{C of E Christ Church}was built in 
 1841 to accommodate 230 people.It was 
 originally a{Chapel of Ease}linked to 
 Ledbury. Burned down in 1944, it was  
 rebuilt using the same walls, by 1952.
 Opposite there is a{local cemetry}Once
 a week the{Rector of Bosbury}presides.
 The Pub at Hope End closed years ago. 
 The remaining Pub,{The Farmers Arms,  
 is in the centre of the village and is
 very{well patronised,}the ensuing     
{heavy traffic causing concern}to the  
 residents. Built over 200 years ago of
 local stone, it was not much more than
 a{cider counter}for the locals, with  
 chickens running free in the straw on 
 the floor. Over the last 15 years it  
 has been{renovated and extended,}and  
 with an increase of tourism in the    
 area, it is well patronised by walkers
 visitors and regulars, who come to    
 enjoy the{excelllent food}offered.    </content>
