		<content>{  Finchdean}is the only village in    
 this area. It has no shops but there  
 are some small businesses.            
   The{blacksmith}is veru busy. We saw 
 lots of interesting things.One was the
 furnace. This is a fire and if you    
 turn the handle it gets very hot. The 
 blacksmith uses many different size   
 nails but all are the same shape.He   
 burns coke instead of coal as it is   
 much cleaner. At one time 5 or 6 men  
 worked there.All around the walls were
 many tools like tongs, iron rods and  
 horse_shoes.The floor was covered with
 old shoes and boxes of nails and new  
 shoes.By the furnace was a water      
 trough for cooling the horse_shoes.
