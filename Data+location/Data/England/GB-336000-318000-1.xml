		<title>01KYNASTON'S CAVE NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> Kynaston's Cave is up on Nesscliffe   
 Hill .Humphrey Kynaston the highway   
 man lived in about 1650. He kept the  
 horse with him in the cave, carved out
 of the rock up a flight of steps.There
 was a window,a door and two rooms, one
 for himself and one for the horse. In 
 the doorway you can still see the     
 bolts for the door. There are shelves 
 carved in the sandstone. A chimney    
 goes diagonally out of the cave. S    
 ome say he put the horses hooves on   
 backwards. No-one really knows.       
    Many things were attributed to     
 Kynaston,such as turning the horse    
 hooves round to stop the soldiers     
 catching him.However,this was said of 
 many highwaymen.The cave is very near 
 the main road so it would not have    
 been difficult for him to find people 
 to rob.
