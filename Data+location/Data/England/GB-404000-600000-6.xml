		<content> My dad is a sheep contractor. He dips 
 the sheep and clips them then he scans
 and looks after them at lambing time. 
 One of the farmers he works for owns  
 large fields called "Parks." These are
 rented out for grazing at Â£90 to Â£120 
 per acre. Dad checks the parks every  
 morning and sometimes I help him. If  
 there is ever a sheep on its back we  
 have to help it up because it could   
 die in that position.                 
 Sometimes dad travels on a clipping   
 contract and I go with him. Recently  
 we went to Yorkshire and he clipped   
 the sheep while I rolled the fleece.  
 He can clip a sheep in two minutes and
 it takes me forty seconds to wrap a   
 fleece. In the north of England we    
 clip from mid May until the end of    
 June.
