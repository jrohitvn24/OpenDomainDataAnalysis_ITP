		<content> adverse effects. Friends of the Earth 
 were concerned that any location in   
 the South of England could face oil   
 exploration without regard for its    
 environmental importance.             
 D.C.C. granted B.P. permission        
 (12.4.85) but imposed 34 conditions   
 including that the work should only be
 carried out in daylight hours on      
 weekdays.                             
 Work began in June 1985 and B.P.      
 adopted a deliberate policy of        
 consideration to the islands wildlife.
 All employees were given a preliminary
 slide show and instruction on the     
 "keep quiet" and "take care" policy.  
 All but essential areas are regarded  
 as "out of bounds". Radios and        
 cassette players are banned. Machinery
 noise is muffled and work is confined 
 to 7am-7pm, depending on tides.
