		<title>02Cheriton - Church and Chapel</title>
		<content>{RELIGION}A{church}was built before the
 first Domesday Book,nothing remains   
 now but a new church took its place{  
 in the 14th Century dedicated to All  
 Saints &lt;now St.Matthew>.The sun dial  
 dates from the 18th Century.          
{The Church Hay }was given to the boys 
 of the village on the 27th April 1648 
 by John Harris.In Church Hay the boys 
 of Cheriton Fitzpaine used to play    
 games and sports.Now people live in   
 Church Hay and its called The         
 Hayes.But although people live there  
 it is used for a car park now.        
{The chapel }is 125 years old this     
 October.A wall started in March 1978  
 has 25 bricks with Sunday School      
 pupils' initials engraved on them by  
 Mr.Woolacott using an electric drill  
 or chisel &amp; hammer.They were laid by  
 the children and this year about 30   
 more bricks were added.               </content>
