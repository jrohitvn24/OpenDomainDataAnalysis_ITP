		<content>In 1980 Cauldon Lowe school closed and 
the building was converted into the    
Staffordshire Peak Arts Centre.        
Inside is a gallery and a restaurant.  
The gallery is full of books, pottery, 
paintings, jewellery, clothes, toys and
furniture which are for sale and are   
all made in Britain.                   
The restaurant serves home-made        
vegetarian meals and one of the most   
popular dishes is homity pie, which is 
like a quiche containing potatoes,     
onions and cheese.                     
The Yew Tree. The Yew Tree has won a   
national "Pub of the Year" competition.
Inside are lots of old things like     
grandfather clocks and pianolas.       
Outside stands the yew tree after which
the pub is named. People come from     
miles away to visit this public house  
because of its unique character and    
very good beer.                        </content>
