		<title>15Coolham &amp; Shipley/Population</title>
		<content>     The small population of the area  
 is concentrated in the villages of    
 Coolham and Shipley, about a mile and 
 a half apart. There are also scattered
 and sometimes quite isolated farms and
 cottages. There has been no new       
 development whatsoever for almost a   
 decade since the last new houses were 
 built at King's Platt, Shipley in the 
 mid 1970s.                            
     Our survey showed that about 70%  
 of properties are detached. The       
 remaining houses and cottages are all 
 semi-detached and there are no        
 terraced properties. Within the area  
 are to be found widely differing types
 of property,from a castle, through    
 manor houses, farmhouses and council  
 houses to very small tied cottages.   
     Our survey sample revealed 61%    
 owner occupation, 21% rented property 
 and 18% tied accomodation.            </content>
