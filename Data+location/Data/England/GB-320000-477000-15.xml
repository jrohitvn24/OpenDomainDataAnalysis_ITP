		<content> Furness County Fair (1985)            
                                       
    This very popular event, which is  
 organised by the Dalton and District  
 Round Table took place on 15th        
 June for the first time in Askam.     
 This very attractive fair includes    
 such competitions as gun dog tests,   
 working tests and other canine        
 challenges such as lurcher shows,     
 hound trails and the British Fell Race
 Championship.                         
    The other activities include       
 terrier racing, clay pigeon shoot, tug
 of war, children's sports, the greasy 
 pole,ice cream and other amusements   
 which include the inevitable beer     
 tent.                                 
    All profits from this event are    
 ploughed back into the community by   
 the Round Table.
