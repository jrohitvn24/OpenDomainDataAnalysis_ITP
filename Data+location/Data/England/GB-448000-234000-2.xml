		<title>02King's Sutton Green</title>
		<content>    King's Sutton is one of the largest
 villages in Northamptonshire and it   
 still has several shops, but you have 
 to go six miles to Banbury to find a  
 market town; in the Domesday Book     
 King's Sutton was recorded as having a
 market of its own.   It was first     
 called Suetone, or Southtown, later it
 became Sutton Regis because it was    
 part of the Royal estates.   From the 
 seventeenth century it was known as   
 King's Sutton.                        
    The oldest houses, like the Parish 
 Church, are situated around a small   
 green where the old village stocks are
 preserved.   Most of these buildings  
 are made of the lovely honey-coloured 
 local stone usually called Hornton    
 stone.   The Manor is the grandest    
 house in the village.
