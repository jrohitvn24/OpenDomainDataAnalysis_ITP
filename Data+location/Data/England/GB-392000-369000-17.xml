		<title>17My journey to school</title>
		<content> Most of the children of my age who    
 live in this area go to Holinhey      
 C.P.School.We all have to find our way
 to school ourselves as there are no   
 school buses.Some of us come to school
 on the local bus when the weather is  
 bad but there are not many of these   
 and they dont run at the right        
 times.Some of my friends are brought  
 to school by car but I walk to school 
 like most of my friends, some of whom 
 walk nearly two miles  each way.I walk
 to school from Lyme Green along Robin 
 Lane,Walker Lane into Tunnicliffe and 
 Bell Avenue.Some of my friends who    
 live on the estate or in Langley are  
 helped across the Lane Ends Junction  
 which can be busy and dangerous.My    
 walk to and from school is not very   
 well lighted and in November until    
 March we often walk in groups to be   
 safer.                                </content>
