		<title>07LOCHE PARK</title>
		<content> The ducks in the park are all wild and
 they come and go as they please.After 
 breeding season the ducks moult.There 
 is a lot of bird watchers who go to   
 the park and sometimes rare birds nest
 there.                                
   In 2 years time the Park has to     
 compete with contracters,and it will  
 be worse working there than it is now,
 because of cut backs.                 
   The gardeners also work there in the
 Winter,not digging as the ground is to
 hard,they go round O.A.P's houses and 
 salt their paths.                     
   There are 22 rowing boats and 8     
 paddel boats,and each boat costs about
 Â£300 each.The putting green and       
 bowling green is always full.The      
 gardeners work 7.30am-4pm Monday till 
 Friday with 40 minutes break          
 altogether.
