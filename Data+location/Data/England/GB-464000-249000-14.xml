		<title>14MAYDAY</title>
		<content> Re-established some eight years ago is
 the village Mayday.This day is divided
 into two parts -a morning session when
 streets within the village community  
 construct their own floats for a      
 parade around the village and to be   
 judged for the best float.            
 The afternoon is made up of dancing   
 displays by Morris Dancers and        
 children doing Maypole dancing. There 
 is sometimes an evening dancing and   
 barbecue event.                       
 Any money which is raised at these    
 events is used to improve the         
 facilities in the village playing     
 field e.g. to purchase the redundant  
 Youth Hostel (recently closed) to make
 this into a club house for village    
 organisations.
