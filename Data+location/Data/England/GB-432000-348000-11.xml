		<title>11A Walk in Wyver Lane,Belper</title>
		<content>   There is rough grazing land at{Wyver
{Farm}covered with sheep and cows. On  
 the left is a wood and there are      
 chestnut trees,oak and hawthorn. On   
 the right is marsh and water meadow.  
 We saw a wren and a blue tit. The     
 water meadow is like a pond but not   
 made of concrete or stone.It is a     
 natural pond. Ducks fly on it and fish
 swim in it.There are trout,pike,roach,
 perch and tench. There is a fishing   
 club. Further along is a disused dump.
 There is a Rifle Range but it is not  
 used any more.                        
    As we walked along we saw several  
 trains. There was the{Inter-City}to   
 Birmingham,coal for powerstations and 
 local train,Belper to Matlock.The line
 is main-line to the North.One was only
 one coach and was a railway laboratory
 Trains pass every few minutes.
