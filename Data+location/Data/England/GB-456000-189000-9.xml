		<title>09Fruit Farms in Brightwell</title>
		<content>Brightwell is a good area for growing  
fruit. Around the village there are    
several fruit farms.                   
Sheard's fruit farm is one we visited  
and we spoke to Paul Sheard. He told us
they grew 25 tons of cherries,         
strawberries, rasberries, loganberries,
gooseberries, plums, greengages, apples
and pears. The farm also sells direct  
to the public and the farm shop is open
all year round. The busiest time is    
during the summer when they have P.Y.O.
weekends. Then people who are going to 
buy the fruit pick it themselves from  
the bushes and trees. The farm employs 
2 or 3 full time workers and some      
casual soft fruit pickers in the       
summer. It's a long day from 8am to 5pm
in winter and 5am to 8pm in summer with
only time to stop for a few cups of    
coffee during the day.
