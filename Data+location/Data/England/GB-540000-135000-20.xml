 Owletts is in the top right corner of 
 our area and is 253 acres in size. It 
 is mainly a beef farm though 20 acres 
 are put aside for corn.The farm has   
 97 beef cattle of the Limousin Cross  
 breed.There are 4 buildings on the    
 farm, excluding the family home,      
 specifically to house the cattle in   
 winter. The grain produced on the farm
 is used as food during the winter- the
 sowing of seeds is the main Spring    
 pre-occupation. As with any farmer,   
 the owner of Owletts, Mr. Slater,     
 considers the weather to be his main  
 problem. The farm employs 2 men .     
 .
