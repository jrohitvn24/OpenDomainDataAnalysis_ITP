		<content> The mill is not in working order. The 
 grindstones are still there.  One is  
 of Sandstone and the other is of      
 French Burstone.  The mill is owned   
 and looked after by the Kent County   
 Council, Property Services Department.
 There is a group called Friends of the
 Mill.  It was started in March 1985.  
 Michael Adams of Kent County Council  
 Property Services Department wanted   
 someone to run the mill.  Some people 
 in the village do no like the group.  
 Their oppinion is that the mill should
 be left alone.  There is a rota of the
 friends who open it on Sundays from   
 April to September.  The Friends of   
 the Mill raise money to help the      
 council to keep the mill in good      
 repair.
