		<content> Mrs. Lay gets up at 7.30. but         
 sometimes 9.30.a.m.  Mrs. Lay's       
 life has differed since she and       
 her husband retired from the          
 surgery.  Mrs. Lay's husband, Dr.     
 E.T. Lay, was a doctor in the area    
 for more than 30 years. She says      
 that she has more free time to do     
 things and persue her{hobbies.}       
 Mrs. Lay has lots of hobbies like     
 walking, gardening, knitting,         
 sewing, attending to her animals      
 but as little housework as possible.  
 They have a boat and go to St.        
 Anthony to fish. Mrs. Lay is a good   
 cook but she only likes to cook       
 savoury things. Mrs. Lay has four     
 children. Mrs. Lay likes to go to     
 the theatre but opportunities to see  
 the professionals in this part of     
 the country are limited.
