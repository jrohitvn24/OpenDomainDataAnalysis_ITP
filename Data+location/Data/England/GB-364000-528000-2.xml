 There are 18 houses, 5 cottages,  4   
 bungalows, and 6 farmhouses that are  
 permanently occupied; 7 of these are  
 rented and 24 are owner occupied.     
 There are also 2 houses that are empty
 and 4 that are used as holiday        
 residences. 20 of the occupied homes  
 have a garage, 7 have a barn and 17   
 have various sheds or outbuildings.   
 Many houses appear to be more recently
 built than is actually the case, the  
 fronts having been re-built whilst the
 interior walls  and rear walls remain 
 of very old construction. The oldest  
 house is reputed to be Garth Cottage. 
 Craiglea has the date 1733 on some    
 internal woodwork.
