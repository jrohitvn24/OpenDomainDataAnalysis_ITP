		<content>{   North Gill Wood :}A gill is the    
 Norse word for a ravine or glen. Thus 
 the meaning of North Gill Wood is 'the
 wood in the in the north ravine'.     
   {Osmon Flat :}The old Norse name    
 'Osmundr', is probably that of a      
 settler who owned much land around    
 Cotherstone as the name occurs        
 frequently in area. This is obviously 
 the flat piece ofland belonging to    
 Osmundr.                              
   {Raygill :}The word 'gill' means a  
 ravine or glen but the first element  
 is rather obscure. It has been called 
 Foxgill but this is not a certain     
 interpretation. It could be related to
 deer in some way as in Raydale the    
 'Ro' is Old English for roebuck.      
{Reahope}in Weardale is derived from   
 'Rea' which is Gaelic for rapid. This 
 is like the Welsh 'Rhe' meaning swift 
 which is the origin of many placename </content>
