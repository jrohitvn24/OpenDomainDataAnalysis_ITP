		<content> Bedfordshire Growers was established  
 in 1965 and is a co-operative of      
 farmers to help the sales and         
 distribution of vegetables in the     
 area.Farmers send a range of crops to 
 the depot including Brussels          
 Sprouts,potatoes,cabbage and          
 lettuce.About 130 farmers are members 
 and 100 of them use the co-operative  
 regularly.Produce is sent to wholesale
 markets,supermarkets and shops.Some   
 produce is sent abroad and this is    
 easier now that Britain is in the     
 Common Market.Most of the transport   
 used by Beds.Growers is hired.        
 About 70 people work at he depot.They 
 come from Biggleswade and surrounding 
 villages.The ladies in the packing    
 house work from 8-30am until          
 3-30pm.The requisites shop is open    
 from 8am until 5pm.The office staff   
 begin work at 7pm.                    </content>
