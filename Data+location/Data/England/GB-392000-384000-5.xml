    We interviewed a lady called       
 Mrs.Lees.  She was 77 years old and   
 has lived in{High Lane}all her life.  
 She could remember when the A6, which 
 is now a very busy road (over 800     
 vehicles an hour), was so quiet that  
 all the children played on it.  All   
 the side roads were empty and had no  
 houses on them, they were dirt tracks 
 which they would play marbles on.     
 Mrs.Lee lived opposite the{Court house
 and could remember the time when the  
 cells were used. She went to the old  
 village school and when she was 11 she
 started to work part-time at the mill 
 in Marple. When she was 14 she left   
 school to work full time at the mill. 
 Other people in{High Lane}either      
 worked at the same mill, on the farms,
 at Lyme Hall, or at a printer's in    
 Disley.                               </content>
