		<title>03The Pre-school Play Groups</title>
		<content> There are three playgroups.Their      
purpose is to enable children to work  
and play together before they reach    
school age. It also gives the mums a   
chance to chat and have a break.       
 At the pavillion there are fourteen   
children altogether, It starts at 9.10 
and finishes at 11.45.  They have      
plasticene, a lot of the children      
make things, they dress up as  kings   
and queens, make pictures with         
paints,do puzzles and play; also       
helpers read books to them.            
 We went to John Hampden Play Group,   
they have been going for four years and
Chapel Lane Play Group for nine years. 
 There are twenty-eight toddlers meet  
in the old chapel.                     
 We think playgroups are very useful.
