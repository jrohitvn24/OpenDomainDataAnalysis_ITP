		<content> In the dairy the electricity bill is  
 approximately Â£800 a year. The milk is
 collected at about 9.00 a.m. each     
 morning. It is taken to a dairy in    
 Manchester. The farmer is paid        
 fourteen and a half pence per litre   
 for the milk. When all the milk has   
 been taken from the cow, the feeder is
 automatically turned off. All cows    
 produce a different amount of milk,   
 all the cows here are Friesians.      
 In winter the cows are fed on soya and
 beans for their protein. They are     
 given water to drink, silage (pickled 
 grass), hay and some iron             
 concentrates.                         
 The owner has just his brother to help
 him but manages to run the farm       
 successfully.He plans to make the farm
 run as efficiently as possible.
