		<content>    Goosie Fair is a special occasion  
 for Tavistock and all school children 
 have a holiday so that they can enjoy 
 the{Fun Fair and stalls.}             
    In 1105 the Abbot of Tavistock was 
 given a{charter}by Henry I to hold    
 markets in the town. There was always 
 a special market in the Autumn when   
 farmers sold geese to the townspeople 
 to celebrate Michaelmas or to fatten  
 up for Christmas. The fair became     
 known as Goosie Fair and is now held  
 on the{second Wednesday in October.}
