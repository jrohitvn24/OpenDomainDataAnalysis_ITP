		<content>      The school day starts at         
 9:05. When a bell rings and everyone  
 goes to morning registration. Another 
 bell rings at 9:15, which signifies   
 the end of registration .             
      On Wednesdays and Fridays, our   
 year has an assembly in the school    
 hall at this time. When we sing and   
 pray and any notices are read out.    
      On Mondays, Tuesdays and         
 Thursdays, we stay in our form rooms  
 and talk or do homework. At 9:25 the  
 bell rings for the start of lessons.  
 We have 8 periods per day, and each   
 period is 35 minutes long. We usually 
 have 2 periods to each subject. The   
 subjects that I study are maths,      
 English, art, cooking, geography,     
 physical education, history, French,  
 German, physics, chemistry, biology,  
 textiles and religious education.
