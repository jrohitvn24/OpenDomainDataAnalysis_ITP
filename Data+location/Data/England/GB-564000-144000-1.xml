		<title>01Paddock Wood,Five Oak Green.</title>
		<content>Our designated area,05640144,consists  
of two villages which are Paddock Wood 
and Five Oak Green. A great deal of the
land is covered by farms. Many of these
farms grow food crops. These farms are 
Whetsted,Church,Durrants and Badsell   
Manor. 50% of Whetsted Farm is given to
sheep farming,the other 50% is for     
crops.It covers an area of 174acres.   
Themain crop in the area used to be    
hops but because there is not so much  
demand for them now they are not so    
widely grown.                          
Paddock Wood's main development centred
around the railway station which was   
built in 1842. Today the station is    
largely used by commuters as it is on  
the main line to London. The railway   
also plays an important part in the    
Transfesa and Distribution complex.
