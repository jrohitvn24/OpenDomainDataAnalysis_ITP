		<content> full of{lanolin}from the woollen      
 mills. Bradford turned this to good   
 account, extracted the lanolin at     
 Esholt,and sold it to make soap,grease
 and wax.                              
 A group from Nab Wood G.S. was invited
 to look round the works.They saw 20   
 deep baths,each one 20 by 30 feet,    
 each filled with deep sewage water.   
 The estate was not just used for the  
 sewage works,however,it also houses   
 Bradford's tree nurseries, where      
 seedlings are grown until they can be 
 transplanted to the cities' streets.  
 A more unusual use for the sewage     
 works some years ago was when the RAC 
 rally ran a special stage through     
 them. As far as we know,none of the   
 cars went into the baths,but some of  
 the drivers were looking distinctly   
 green when they left the stage!!!
