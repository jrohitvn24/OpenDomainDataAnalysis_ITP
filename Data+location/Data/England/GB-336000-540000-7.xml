		<title>07Dairy farming in Cumbria</title>
		<content> All the farms in the block have dairy 
 herds ranging from 20 to 120 animals. 
 Most are Friesians, chosen for their  
 high milk yield.                      
 The larger farms have modern milking  
 parlours, smaller establishments milk 
 in the byre with a pipeline to the    
 cooler.   On one farm the cows are    
 milked into bucket units which are    
 carried by hand to the cooling house. 
 Milk is collected by tanker each day  
 for delivery to a milk processing     
 plant.   Careful records are kept, and
 on the more progressive farms feed is 
 related to milk yield.                
 Nearly all the farms have increased   
 their young beef stock to compensate  
 for the reduction in milk quotas.     
 Some farmers keep one or more bulls   
 for breeding purposes, others rely on 
 artificial insemination.
