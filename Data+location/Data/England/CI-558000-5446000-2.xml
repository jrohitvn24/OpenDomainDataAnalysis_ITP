		<title>02THE RAILWAY WALK</title>
		<content>  The railway walk is a pathway from   
 the town of St. Helier to the         
 headland of La Corbiere. The route    
 which the pathway takes is along the  
 old railway track which used to run   
 from the town to the west of the      
 island. The tracks were lifted up in  
 1936 but relaid by the Germans. After 
 the war the route was made into an    
 attractive walkway. The first part of 
 it runs along the picturesque St.     
 Aubin's Bay where a station has now   
 been converted into a cafe. After St  
 Aubin, trains passed through the      
 countryside. This part of the path has
 been lined with plants and trees. The 
 whole pathway is used by the local    
 people and the tourists. It serves as 
 a route to school for many children,  
  as a jogging track, a cycle track, or
 simply as a place for a family stroll 
 after Sunday lunch.                   </content>
