		<title>13A Day at Cannington School</title>
		<content> I leave home at 8.30am for school and 
 call for some friends on the way. When
 we get to school we mess around in the
 playground. School starts at 9.00am.  
 We do mental arithmetic and at 9.20am 
 we have assembly. When we come back   
 from assembly we do maths until       
 break; break is from 10.40am_10.55am. 
 Then we go into class again until     
 12.10pm when dinner break begins. We  
 go into dinner at 12.30pm. Break      
 finishes at 1.10pm. After dinner we do
 group work. When we do group work we  
 split into 5 groups of 6 or 7         
 children. Each group works on a       
 differant subject, these subjects are 
 Science,Maths, History, Art and       
 Individual Topic. At 2.10 we have     
 another break of 15 minutes. Then our 
 teacher reads us a story. Our presant 
 story is called "Good Night Mr.Tom"   
 which is about a war refugee.         </content>
