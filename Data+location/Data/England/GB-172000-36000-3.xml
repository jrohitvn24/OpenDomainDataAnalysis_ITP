		<content>  Our school is over a hundred years   
 old. When it was first built the girls
 and boys were in separate schools.    
 There are about hundred and fifty     
 pupils in the school aged four and    
 half to  eleven. At eleven, children  
 go to Redruth comprehensive school. We
 have five full-time teachers and a    
 head teacher but we are losing a part 
 time teacher because of council cuts. 
 There are five classes, a hall, a     
 staff room and a library.             
 Amongst the lessons we do in school   
 are English, maths, history, story    
 writing, science, geography, map      
 reading and reading. We have a BBC    
 computer. Our school is a happy       
 school and it is not as strict as it  
 used to be when the boys were not     
 allowed to talk to the girls and the  
 cane was used all the time for silly  
 things like talking in class.         </content>
