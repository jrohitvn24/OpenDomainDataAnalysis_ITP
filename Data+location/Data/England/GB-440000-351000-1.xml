		<content>  Our area is in Eastern Derbyshire    
 right on the boundary with            
 Nottinghamshire.It used to be part of 
 the Nottinghamshire coalfield,but is  
 now mainly light industry.In          
 Somercotes and Riddings there are     
 some factories that make such things  
 as clothes and chemicals.There is a   
 big brickworks at Butterley.          
  About half of our area is built up   
 and half is farmland.There are 4      
 villages that all run into each       
 other-Somercotes,Leabrooks,Riddings,  
 Swanwick but Ironville is on its own. 
  The houses are mainly terraced,semi- 
 detached and town-houses.The people   
 are fairly ordinary and not that rich 
 except for one area in Swanwick which 
 is quite well off.
