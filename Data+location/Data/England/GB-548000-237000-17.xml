   The motorway is always very busy    
 espially in the mornings and evenings 
 when lorries cars and other vehicles  
 are driven to the large towns and     
 cities.                               
   Approximately 572 vehicles go in the
 direction of Cambridge and 607 go to  
 London,in 20 minutes.                 
   The motorway was built in 1976 and  
 opened for use in 1979.A few people   
 who live near the motorway who were   
 previously on generated electricity   
 changed to mains when the motorway was
 built.This was because the mains      
 electricity was redirected and is now 
 able to reach there homes.            
   The motorway acts as a link between 
 London and its{commuter belt}.It gives
 much easier{access}to London and      
 Cambridge.
