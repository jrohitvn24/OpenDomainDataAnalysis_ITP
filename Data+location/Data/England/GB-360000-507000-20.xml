		<title>20A CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>  A typical day for me,Mark,aged 11, is
 to get up about 7.00am and make ready 
 for school. I make my breakfast and   
 then get changed. I go and see dad    
 in the milking parlour and talk to    
 him. When dad has finished milking I  
 take the cows and put them into a     
 field for him and then carry on to    
 school.                               
  At school we have two playtimes and  
 at 12 noon we have dinner. The dinners
 are nice. My school teacher is called 
 Mr Falshaw. I do not like school. I   
 would rather help dad at home. School 
 finishes at 3.30pm. I bike to and from
 school.                               
  When I get home I get changed and    
 have tea. After tea I help dad to do  
 some jobs on the farm. We have supper 
 about six o'clock. I have a last look 
 around the animals before going to bed
 at nine o'clock.                      </content>
