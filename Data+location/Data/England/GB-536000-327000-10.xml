 also vicar of Holbeach Bank,Holbeach  
 St. Marks and Holbeach St. Matthew but

 but the best attended ones are        
 at Christmas,Easter and Harvest.There 
 is a special children's crib service

 churches in the group will hold the   
 main service.Mr. Stokes takes         
 assemblies at the two nearby primary  
 schools and also at Hovenden House,the
 local Leonard Cheshire home on the
