		<title>06FARMING IN BELLE VALE PAST</title>
		<content> We went to interview{Mr &amp; Mrs Harrison
 who were once the farmers at{BELLE    
{VALE FARM}from{1915-41.}It was an     
 arable farm and was inherited from a  
 relation.Potatoes and wheat were two  
 of their main crops.They employed five
 labourers who were all Irish.3 were   
 permanant labourers and two came each 
 year for the potato harvest.Their     
 crops were sold at{Cazneau Street     
{Market}&amp; were sent there by train from
 special sidings at {Gateacre station.}
   Most of the farm{machinery}in use   
 was pulled by horses.They also kept   
 cows,sheep and one pig and often      
 took their livestock to the{Woolton   
{Agricultural Show.}The farm was       
 eventually sold on compulsory purchase
 to Liverpool City Council for building
 purposes. This was because many houses
 in the city centre had been bombed    
 and land was needed for new homes.    </content>
