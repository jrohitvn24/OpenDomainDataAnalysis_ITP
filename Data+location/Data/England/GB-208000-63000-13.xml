		<title>13GLYNN HOUSE</title>
		<content>{Glynn House }was built between 1850   
 and 1890 and is situated high in the  
 hills. Dr.Mitchell is the man who owns
 it. He is a scientist who does        
 Biological Research. During the Second
 World War it was bombed and the roof  
 was badly damaged. Then when          
 Dr.Mitchell came to open a small      
 chicken farm he employed 24 men and it
 took them 2 years to put the roof back
 together again.                       
  There used to be beautiful gardens   
 there but they are a bit overgrown    
 now. Just down the drive is a massive 
 lake with trees surrounding it. Behind
 the house there are a couple of farm  
 houses where gardeners live.Glynn     
 House is not open to the public and is
 strictly private. There are cattle    
 grazing around in the fields. At      
 night the house is floodlit.
