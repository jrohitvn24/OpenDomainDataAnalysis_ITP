		<title>05Wildlife in Newton Toney</title>
		<content>{Newton Toney}is a very green peaceful 
 village. There is a river called the  
{Bourne.}It twists through the village 
 and runs through {Allington}and {     
{Boscombe}also. When it is hot in the  
 summer the river can dry up completely
  and even the tadpoles were having    
 trouble trying to breath.{Mrs Pownall 
  lives in Newton Toney. She told us   
 that people throw buckets of water    
 into the river to try and save the    
 tadpoles.Then we saw quite a lot of   
 house martins .There weren't many farm
 animals around. We saw a few  water   
 spiders, some minnows and some frogs  
 spawn. There were lots of neat gardens
 and hedges  which were well looked    
 after. We saw some dragonflies and    
 bumble bees and some moor hens by the 
 river bank and some craneflies.
