		<content>    I get up at 7.00 a.m., get washed  
 and dressed and wait for breakfast    
 because my mum takes my dad to work.My
 dad works for British Telecom and my  
 mum is a Home Help. When she comes    
 back we have toast whilst watching    
 Breakfast Time television. Later I get
 ready for school.St.Stephen's School  
 starts at 9.00a.m. We have our        
 assembly of hymn singing and prayers  
 and then go into class to work.       
 Playtime is at 10.30 a.m. sometimes we
 talk or play under-arm tig where      
 somebody is 'on' if they 'tig' you.   
 Then you put your arms up and somebody
 goes under your arms to free you.We go
 back into school at 10.45 a.m. and    
 work until dinner time. After  dinner 
 we go out to play and come in at 1.30 
 p.m. School ends at 4.00 p.m. When I  
 get home I call for a friend.I come in
 at 8.00 p.m. and go to bed at 9.30 p.m</content>
