		<content>  In this strongly agricultural area,  
 the 17 farms named provide employment 
 for some of the population in the many
 rural communities.                    
  Powick Hospital,run by the NHS to    
 treat people with mental illnesses, is
 the major employer for local villagers
 and people from nearby towns.         
  However,most people commute each day 
 from their homes in Callow End,Powick,
 Collett's Green and Bowling Green to  
 work or school in Worcester or        
 Malvern,or further afield in towns    
 along the M5.                         
  The larger dormitory settlements are 
 characterised by a mixture of old     
 traditional buildings of local        
 materials, and new private and        
 council housing estates.
