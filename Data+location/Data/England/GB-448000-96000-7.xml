		<title>07EGYPT POINT LIGHTHOUSE-COWES</title>
		<content> The{Egypt Point Lighthouse}faces out  
 across the Solent from a place half km
 west of  the Royal Yacht Squadron.It  
 has an iron frame and a copper roof   
 and provides a navigational light.The 
 water around the lighthouse is 13 or  
 14 metres deep and is not very        
 dangerous.It is very small but        
 contains a lot of eletrical equipment.
 The light is made up of 5 pairs of 250
 watt bulbs which rotate and can be    
 seen through the channel as far as    
 Ryde.When a light fails another one is
 automatically positioned.A battery is 
 kept on charge at all times in case   
 there is a power cut.The lighthouse is
 the responsibility of Trinity House   
 and a part-time attendant is employed 
 to inspect it every day and to clean  
 it when necessary,usually after a bad 
 storm.                                
                                       </content>
