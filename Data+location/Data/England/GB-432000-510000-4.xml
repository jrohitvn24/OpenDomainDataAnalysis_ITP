		<title>04DINSDALE MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content>  The Manor House at Low Dinsdale is   
 the oldest house in our area.The      
 present house was built in 1536 and   
 has been added to at various dates    
 since then. It was previously a       
 fortified settlement and the family   
 seat of the Surtees family, the name  
 being taken from the River Tees. A    
 dried up moat still survives around   
 the house and has a bridge across     
 it.This was the original entrance over
 the moat.It has carved on it the      
 family crest of the Surtees family.   
 This is a very ancient settlement     
 from Danish times and a house on this 
 site was mentioned in the First       
 Doomsday Book as DIRNESHALE or        
 DIGNESHALE.The building is a scheduled
 ancient monument.Details are kept by  
 the Surtees Society of Antiquities in 
 Newcastle upon Tyne
