		<title>04MAULDEN HOUSING</title>
		<content>   Maulden is a conservation area,     
 although much of it is taken up by    
 houses which have been approved by the
 planning authority over the years. We 
 spoke to a local builder who is       
 building detached houses in Maulden,he
 said;                                 
    {"Maulden started off as a small   
{village a lot of houses have been     
{allowed to be built."                 
   We looked at the houses and decided 
 that there will not many more built.  
   The most populuar type of house in  
 Maulden is detached. There is an old  
 peoples accommodation estate,which is 
 looked after by a warden.
