		<content> The main road from St.Lawrence to     
 Niton is now in its second place,     
 having originally been much closer    
 to the cliff.From Niton Undercliff to 
 Blackgang the early road was improved 
 in about 1838 and was an immensely    
 popular drive until it was lost in the
 great cliff fall and landslip of 1928.
 It was not possible to reconstruct it 
 and a new road was built in 1933 from 
 Upper Niton over the southern end of  
 St.Catherine's Down;this road affords 
 a superb view across the great bay to 
 Freshwater and sweeps down in easy    
 curves to join the old road on the    
 west of Blackgang.In the summer there 
 is heavy tourist traffic,causing some 
 congestion,especially along the Under-
 cliff Drive and through Niton.However,
 straightening and widening these roads
 will only result in destroying the    
 character of the area.                </content>
