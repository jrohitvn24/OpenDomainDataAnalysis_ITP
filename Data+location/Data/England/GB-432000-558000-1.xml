 Our block comprises the large council 
 housing estates of Hylton Castle, Town
 End Farm, part of Downhill, part of   
 the village of Castletown and the     
 farmland and grassland to the west of 
 the A.19 a major north-south trunk    
 road.  The houses on Hylton Castle,   
 Town end Farm and Downhill were built 
 in the late 1950's and early sixties  
 during a slum clearance programme.    
 They were also built to house workers 
 from the nearby factories.  The houses
 in Castletown are older and were built
 to house miners working at the local  
 colliery.  Most of the houses are     
 semi-detached, each with their own    
 garden.                               
 The stone from Downhill Quarry is used
 for the foundations of roads and      
 buildings.                            </content>
