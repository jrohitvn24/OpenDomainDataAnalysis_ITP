		<title>04THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>  The church was rebuilt in 1851.It is 
 built of red sandstone and has a      
 double chancel Nave with a north aisle
 and tower and a mortuary chapel.      
  Its dedication to St.John the Baptist
 seems to point to the fact that it    
 existed at a very early date in the   
 History of Christian England.         
  The ancient font is perhaps one of   
 the earliest in the country,and a much
 more modern base was carved in the    
 14th century.The south doorway and the
 Eastern side of the nave arcade show  
 that there was a church here in late  
 Norman times.                         
  There is a perpendicular window in   
 the tower,though the latter is of     
 13th Century Workmanship.The whole    
 of the church,except the tower was    
 rebuilt by Sir Gilbert Scott in 1851, 
 when all stones in good order were    
 preserved and replaced.               </content>
