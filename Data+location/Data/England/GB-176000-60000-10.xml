		<content>{Unemployment}Many local people don't  
 like the 'visitors' who come from up  
 country for a holiday instead of      
 looking for work.  {Traffic}A number  
 of people think that there should be a
 multi-storey car park because there is
 not enough car parking space in the   
 holiday seasons.  {Gannel Link Road}  
 The residents of Pentire do not like  
 the idea because it will spoil the    
 beauty of the river and cause tidal   
 problems.  {Stealing}The public in the
 Crantock area think stealing is on the
 increase, especially petty theft.  {  
{Vandalism} People feel this is a big  
 problem as posts and signs are torn up
 for barbecues, toilets are spray      
 painted and paths made where they     
 shouldn't be.  {Dogs}A lot of locals  
 are concerned about the health hazard 
 caused by dogs fouling our beaches.
