 this group were in managerial         
 positions or directors of companies.  
 There was a small group of people whom
 it was difficult to categorise. They  
 all provided a necessary{public}      
{service.}They were:- a broadcaster, a 
 Member of the European Parliament, a  
 policeman, a playgroup supervisor and 
 a golf instructor.
