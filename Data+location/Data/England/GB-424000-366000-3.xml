      THE ROWSLEY&amp;BEELEY AREA          
                                       
    Our rectangle is mostly trees and  
 wood.It has got two villages which are
 called Beeley and Rowsley.We have got 
 some of Chatsworth Park in our block, 
 about four people live in it and live 
 up Church lane which is in our block. 
 Our rectangle is 4 by 3km,We did      
 seven miles of it.Most of the walk we 
 did was through woodland and          
 fields.There are two rivers called the
 river Derwent and the river Wye.It is 
 the river Derwent that runs through   
 Chatsworth park.The river Wye runs    
 past our school.  Our school is not in
 our block . It was                    
 nice walking round all the woods and  
 fields.The fields are mostly grazing  
 land and farm land and the woods are  
 coniferous and deciduous.             </content>
