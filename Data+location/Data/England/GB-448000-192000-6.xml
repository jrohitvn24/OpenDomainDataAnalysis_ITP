		<title>06The Abingdon Marathon.</title>
		<content>    The marathon started and finished  
 in Abingdon, following a route through
 the local villages and taking in      
 Culham, Sutton Courtenay and Drayton. 
    It began at 11.00 am and the first 
 man came through Drayton at 1.30 pm.  
    I am in the Army Cadets and we     
 helped by passing wet sponges to the  
 runners.                              
    In the morning it was raining but  
 it had stopped by the afternoon. The  
 runners finished going through Drayton
 at 5 o'clock.                         
    This was the third year that the   
 race has been held and two teachers   
 from our school entered - Mr.         
 Bainbridge and Miss Porter who covered
 twenty six miles in 4 hours and 10    
 minutes.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
