		<title>19PUBLIC QUESTIONNAIRES</title>
		<content>   In the early 1980s, questionnaires  
 were published,displays erected and   
 meetings held for all inhabitants of  
 the areas affected by the proposed    
 Pudsey/Dishforth motorways east and   
 west of Leeds.The response was very   
 variable,depending on how much each   
 individual would be affected. In      
 Harewood,out of a population of 2110, 
 only 20 people gave any response to   
 either route. The 3000 people who     
 responded included landowners         
 objecting to the loss of their land;  
 the general public who were concerned 
 about noise,vibration and pollution   
 factors,and conservationists who      
 feared for the obstruction of scenic  
 views,the effect of "slip-way"areas   
 and the loss of recreational          
 facilities of woodland and riverside  
 walks.
