		<content>     {Education}is a unique industry on
 which Bedford built and capitalised,  
 and it is one which is still thriving.
{The Harpur Trust,}a registered charity
 founded in 1566 by Sir William Harpur,
 derives income from an estate in      
 Holborn, London. There are four       
 schools;{Bedford}and{Bedford Modern   
 for boys,{Bedford High}and{Dame Alice 
{Harpur}for girls. Each occupies a     
 large site in Bedford, with a mixture 
 of old and modern buildings.          
     The schools employ 750 people     
 directly, many others indirectly. The 
 total number of pupils is 4200,       
 comprising of boarders and day pupils.
 Pupils ages range from 7-18. Typical  
 fees for the year 1985 are Â£2000      
 (Â£1400 extra for boarders).           
     Some families receive financial   
 assistance from Government and Trust  
 schemes.                              </content>
