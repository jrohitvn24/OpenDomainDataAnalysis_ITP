		<content> Many small rural schools in           
 Gloucestershire have closed. A small  
 one still working in our area is      
{Hope's Hill School.}It was started in 
 1833 by the bequest of{Edward Goff    
 1738-1813 . He was born at Kington,   
 Herefordshire,and walked 150 miles to 
 London. He worked as a coal heaver    
 and made a fortune. He was converted  
 to Christianity and insisted that his 
 teachers should be also. At{Longhope  
 the school adjoins the{Zion Baptist   
{chapel}and the headteacher was the    
 pastor. It was known as the{British   
{School.}It was taken over by the      
 County council in the 1950s. It now   
 has{39 pupils}and{2.2 teachers.}Most  
 of                                    
 the children come from Litte London   
 and that side of Longhope village.
