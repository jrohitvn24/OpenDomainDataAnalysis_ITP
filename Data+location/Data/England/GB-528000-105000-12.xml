		<content> We like playing '44 home', when the   
 bushes and the grass are dry, we hide 
 everywhere we can and try and try and 
 get back to the post without being    
 seen.                                 
 'Cut and Mouse' is a game to save mice
 from the cat's basket.                
 'Come to Coventry' is another version 
 of Hide and Seek. If caught and you   
 can see somebody waving at you, you   
 escape when the person who is 'it' is 
 not looking.                          
 'Tag' is a game that is very old and  
 was played by children quite a long   
 time ago; the rules have not been     
 changed.                              
 'Scarecrow' is another tag game. If   
 somebody is chasing you you put up    
 your arms and look like a scarecrow.  
 When the person who is 'it' is not    
 near, omebody will run under your arms
 and you are then free.                </content>
