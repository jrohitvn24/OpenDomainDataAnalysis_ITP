		<title>13Tourists and Wildlife</title>
		<content> The inhabitants do not want the island
 to be privatised and they welcome     
 Tourists- over 100 thousand come each 
 year-, but they wish they did not come
 all at once in August!                
 People living on the island enjoy the 
 wildlife very much,providing their    
 gardens are not ruined. There are     
 about thirty deer and about eighty red
 squirrels. They are allowed to kill   
 rabbits and would not want to kill any
 of the other creatures. There are     
 many peacocks roaming the island.     
 Visitors have been banned from taking 
 the beautiful feathers away from the  
 island as some people have been seen  
 pulling feathers from the peacocks'   
 tails.                                
 Many of the residents eat sea food    
 like crab and lobsters.Otherwise all  
 their food and other supplies come    
 from Poole and Bournemouth.           </content>
