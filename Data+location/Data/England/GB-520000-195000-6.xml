		<title>06Arkley Windmill</title>
		<content> The windmill was built c.1806 by a    
 Mr. Whitehead when corn prices were   
 high due to the Napoleonic Wars. It   
 was used until about 1917. In 1929 it 
 was auctioned to Mr. Booth who made   
 many alterations. A pair of sails were
 hung, the cap rebuilt, etc. Mr. and   
 Mrs. W. Saunders bought the mill in   
 1958 and the missing sails were       
 replaced. They are 28 feet long and 6 
 feet wide. The machinery is still     
 intact and the sails are turned every 
 quarter day to prevent water          
 collecting and rotting them. The last 
 miller to grind corn in Arkley was    
 Noah Edwards. Some people who were in 
 Arkley in 1961 remembered going to the
 mill house for flour and the miller   
 going to Mill Hill with pony and van  
 to sell his wares.
