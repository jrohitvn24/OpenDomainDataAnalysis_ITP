		<content> All the land not occupied by houses   
 and gardens is intensively managed    
 grassland now forming part of a farm  
 to the North, Sunderland Brows.       
 The fields of about 5 acres are       
 separated by cob (earth) banks,       
 hawthorn hedges, or stone walls.      
 Most fields are permanent pasture;    
 several meadows are cut for hay or    
 silage once or twice each summer.     
 The farm is mixed dairy and beef,     
 stocked almost entirely with Friesian 
 or Friesian cross cattle which graze  
 the pasture during the summer months  
 and are housed inside during the      
 winter.                               
 The farm makes  a small delivery of   
 untreated bottled milk to the village,
 but most of the milk is sold in bulk  
 for treatment, processing, and resale.
