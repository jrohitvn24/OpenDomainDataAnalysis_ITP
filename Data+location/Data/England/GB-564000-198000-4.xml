		<content> Fryerning lies approximately one mile 
 north of Ingatestone. It is a         
 scattered parish including the areas  
 of Beggar Hill and Mill Green and     
 contains about one hundred houses.    
 There are no shops of any description 
 in the area - only a couple of post   
 boxes, a church (just outside the     
 block) and three pubs - The Huntsman  
 (just inside the block) and The       
 Cricketers and The Viper (just        
 outside).                             
                                       
 The majority of houses in Fryerning   
 are arranged in a triangle along Mill 
 Green Road and Back Lane with a short 
 connecting road acting as the base of 
 the triangle. All the houses have     
 large gardens and are surrounded by   
 fields, meadows and woodland. There   
 are no factories or industrial        
 buildings in Fryerning.               </content>
