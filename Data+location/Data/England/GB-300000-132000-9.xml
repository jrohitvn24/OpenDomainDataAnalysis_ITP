		<content> The area is very attractive and       
 therefore attracts a number of        
 tourists, particularly those who are  
 trying to escape from the traditional 
 tourist routes.                       
 We passed the pub at Ralegh's Cross at
 Saturday lunch time in the summer and 
 the tables on the lawn at the front of
 the pub were full of people eating and
 enjoying the sunshine.                
 Many wish to retire to the area and   
 some even buy up buildings to use as  
 holiday homes, a practice not liked by
 the local residents since it raises   
 the price of housing in the area. (A  
 three bedroomed converted cottage     
 would cost about Â£30 000).            
 The TV masts at King's Brompton       
 common have been sprayed with slogans 
 by the Welsh Nationalists in the past 
 since they beam English language      
 programmes to South Wales.            </content>
