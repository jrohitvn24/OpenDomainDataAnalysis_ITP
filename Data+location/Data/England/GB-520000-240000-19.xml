		<title>19THE GOVERNMENT OF HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> Although we at the moment do have a   
 local councillor living in the village
 the only way we really have any say in
 the way the affairs of the village are
 run is through the Parish Council.This
 consists of 6 villagers chaired by Mr 
 Harry King. It has an income of Â£1350 
 from the rates which is spent in vari-
 ous ways. In 1984 it was used to buy  
 the 3/4 acre plot of the old sewage   
 farm from the District council after  
 mains drainage had been installed.That
 was then planted as a small wood. The 
 Parish council oversees the upkeep of 
 the footpaths etc and is active in    
 seeing that present agricultural prac-
 tices of spraying, removing of hedge- 
 rows and straw burning are changed.The
 war memorial is also being repaired,  
 painted and new seats fitted.Unfortun-
 ately it is currently disputing owner-
 ship of a plot of land in its care.   </content>
