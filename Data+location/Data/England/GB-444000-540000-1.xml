		<content> Until the late 19th century the area  
 covered in this project was used as   
 farmland.Along with beef and dairy    
 cattle the cereal crops of wheat,oats 
 and barley along with potatoes and    
 turnips were grown on the farms that  
 averaged some 100 acres per farm.Only 
 two farms are in the section          
 now,Warren House farm and Blackhills  
 Farm.                                 
     The southern part of the project  
 area is dominated by the seaward end  
 of{Castle Eden Dene.}The dene is the  
 largest dene on the Permian plateau of
 East Durham.The denes were cut by the 
 melting water at the end of the last  
 glacial period.As the volume of water 
 decreased then the rock and soil      
 carried by the vast amounts of        
 meltwater were deposited leaving the  
 denes at their present size.The dene  
 is now a nature reserve               </content>
