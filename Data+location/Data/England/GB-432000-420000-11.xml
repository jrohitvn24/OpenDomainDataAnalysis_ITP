		<title>11WAKEFIELD DISTRICT COLLEGE</title>
		<content> The college was established in 1981 to
 provide all the educational needs for 
 young people aged 16 and over, and    
 opportunities for continuous education
 for all people interested. This work  
 is carried out on three main sites and
 eight annexes throughout the district.
 By this year 1985, the college had    
 succeeded in obtaining the best ever  
 examination results within the State  
 educational provision in the Wakefield
 district, as well as the highest      
 number of students obtaining places at
 University and Polytechnic. We have   
 2500 full time students and 4000 part 
 time students, and as well as trying  
 to prepare them for using the skills  
 of tomorrow we encourage our students 
 to work as teams so that skills and   
 harmony are combined.
