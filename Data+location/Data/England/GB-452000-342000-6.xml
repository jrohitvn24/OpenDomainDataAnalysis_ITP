		<content> In a survey of Yellow Pages of our    
 area covering approximately 2,500     
 sq.km. we discovered that almost half 
 of all dyers, bleachers and soap      
 manufacturers, were situated in a two 
 square kilometre block in the Basford 
 area. This industry grew up along the 
 Leen Valley especially in this area   
 because of the availability of        
 excellent water supplies. These are in
 the form of the River Leen itself and 
 springs and wells cut deep into the   
{Bunter Sandstone}in which the water   
 collects. The bleaching process also  
 required large quantities of limestone
 which were in abundant supply locally.
 Other firms tend to specialize in     
 dyeing certain articles in huge       
 quantities. It is no accident either  
 that Shipstone's{Brewery}is also      
 situated nearby using the same water  
 sources.                              </content>
