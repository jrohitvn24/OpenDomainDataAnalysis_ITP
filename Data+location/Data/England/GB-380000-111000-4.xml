		<content> In January 1980 a Public Meeting was  
 held in the Portman Hall Shillingstone
 It was decided,on the instigation of  
 the Headmistress,Governors            
 and PTA ,to set up a fundraising      
 committee to finance major            
 improvements to the school.Not only   
 the school benefitted from the        
 numerous fundraising activities which 
 followed.The community spirit         
 generated led to a remarkable giving  
 of time,energy and cooperation as well
 as money.In 4 years this small village
 with a school of less than 50 pupils  
 raised over Â£7000 and purchased a new 
 classroom for the Infants,freeing the 
 original 1855 schoolroom for use as a 
 Hall/Gym.Since then the committee has 
 raised a further Â£4000 to equip the   
 Gym.The PTA raise generous funds also.
