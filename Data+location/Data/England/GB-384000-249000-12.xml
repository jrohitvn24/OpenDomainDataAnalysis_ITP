		<title>12HOUSING IN KEMPSEY.</title>
		<content>   The housing in Kempsey ranges from  
 Pre Georgian to very modern. Most of  
 the houses have been built in the last
 50 years. These 'modern' houses have  
 reasonable sized gardens and most of  
 the houses are big. The houses are    
 built from red brick near the centre  
 of the village.                       
   The older houses seem to be situated
 further out from the village centre.  
 This is because they were built to be 
 near the farms.                       
   It is the growth of the new housing 
 estates that has made Kempsey one of  
 the largest villages in the country.  
 One of the reasons for this growth is 
 that in the late 20th century, people 
 who spent all of the day working in   
 cities wanted somewhere 'quiet' to    
 come home to in the evening. Kempsey's
 proximity to the M5  motorway makes it
 an ideal place for such a home.       </content>
