		<content> If you live in a small village you    
 really need to have your own          
 transport.Some villages have no bus   
 service at all.There is a bus which   
 goes to Bridgwater twice a week via   
 Burrowbridge and Moorland.Most        
 families have at least one car.Young  
 people learn to drive as soon as they 
 are old enough.Some of them start off 
 on motor bikes or scooters until they 
 are old enough to drive a car.        
 People use their cars for             
 shopping,going to work,taking children
 to school,visiting the doctor or      
 dentist and for outings.              
 People who have not got cars have to  
 walk or cycle or ask other people to  
 give them a lift.It is very expensive 
 to have a taxi.                       
 Everyone should drive very carefully  
 on country roads because there are no 
 pavements.                            </content>
