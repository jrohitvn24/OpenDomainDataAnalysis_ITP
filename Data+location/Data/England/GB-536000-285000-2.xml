		<content> The area around Chatteris is excellent
 for farming and prices can reach{Â£4000
 per acre. This is a large tenant farm 
 of{900}acres although there are a     
 number of smaller farms in the area.  
    The crops in acres are{wheat(500); 
{sugarbeet(150); potatoes(110);}dwarf  
 French beans(80); carrots(30) and peas
 (20). There is a five_year rotation   
 which helps to prevent fungal disease.
 The sugarbeet, green beans and carrots
 are supplied by contract to firms such
 as British Sugar and Ross Foods. The  
 wheat, potatoes and peas are sold on  
 the open market. Most of the potatoes 
 go to make chips.                     
    Since the farm was taken over in   
 1969, every acre has been{drained}with
 10cm clay pipes which discharge into  
 the nearby river. In summer the soil  
 dries out quickly so the potato crop  
 has to be{irrigated.                  </content>
