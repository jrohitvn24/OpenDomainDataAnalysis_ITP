		<title>04Where  Norton goes to shop.</title>
		<content>We sent out a questionnaire on where   
people went to buy different things.   
From the results the most popular      
shopping areas were the local shops    
followed by Hanley. Burslem, although  
closer didnot do as well.But it was    
clear that where you went shopping     
depended on what you wanted to buy.For 
instance newspapers were practically   
all bought from the local shop, but    
clothes were usually purchased from    
Hanley,where there was greater choice. 
The local hairdressing shops were also 
used a great deal, whilst Hanley did   
well for electrical goods and furniture
though in these catergories Burslem out
marked the local shops. Surprisingly   
hardware tended to be bought locally,  
though this may be due to the local    
hardware retailer being of a good      
standard. Food was also bought in the  
area rather than town supermarkets.    </content>
