		<title>06CHILDRENS' GAMES</title>
		<content> Hop-scotch is a school game because   
 courts are needed.  Tallyo has two    
 teams and is a hide and seek game,    
 using a wall as a 'block' to free your
 team-mates.  Infants make up games    
 like "Star Wars", "Superman" and      
 others.  "Spotlight" shines a torch on
 your opponent at night and they try to
 catch someone else.  Kick-the-can and 
 Whip-and-Top used to be popular.      
 Cricket and Football are popular among
 boys.  Infants (not Juniors) play     
 Chasey instead.  Indoors, board games 
 and computers interest both boys and  
 girls. The girls like rounders. Kingo 
 involves throwing a ball at someone in
 a circle, then the person hit shouts  
 'Kingo!' and everyone stops while they
 throw the ball.  Queenie involves     
 passing a ball behind your back and   
 guessing who has it.  Bulldog is a    
 rough team game trying to pass a mark.</content>
