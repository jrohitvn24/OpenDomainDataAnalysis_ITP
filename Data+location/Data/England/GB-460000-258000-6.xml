		<title>06 THE ROYAL MILITARY DEPOT</title>
		<content>  {The Depot} was begun in 1804 as a   
base for the supply and repair of army 
weapons.It used to cover over 100      
acres but now covers only 32 acres.It  
has eight large warehouses and a series
of ammunition stores as well as many   
other buildings.It has two gate houses 
with portcullises.One gatehouse has a  
clock on it.                           
  {The Depot} was put up for sale in   
1985 and has recently been bought by a 
property firm.It will be converted into
offices and houses.                    
   We sent a questionaire to some      
parents.Most  people wanted the        
buildings left as they were(42%) and   
converted into either a sports         
centre(34%),a museum(31%) or a craft   
and garden centre(22%).                
  Recently a television advertisment   
was filmed in the depot.
