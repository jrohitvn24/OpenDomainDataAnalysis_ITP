		<content> There are{14 people}who have got {    
{videos in our class of 30.}A video    
 recorder records programmes that you  
 have missed so you can watch it if    
 some one has recorded it. There is a  
 timer to set so that the program will 
 be recorded when you are not at home. 
 The video picks up sound and pictures 
 on a magnetic tape instead of film. If
 a video camera is connected to a video
 recorder it is possible to record     
 movement and sound like a cine-film   
 camera. Video tapes can be played back
 through a television instead of a     
 projector and screen. It is possible  
 to buy or hire a video tape for use at
 home. The nearest place is Boundary   
 Court where you can hire a film for   
 Â£l.00 a night.
