		<title>10Leaden Roding Fire Station 1</title>
		<content> The first recorded fire station was in
 1844. In those days the fire engine   
 was drawn by horses, which had to be  
 collected from the fields and attached
 to the fire engine before they could  
 attend a fire. That engine still      
 stood in it's original station until  
 the Second World War and this was the 
 only Roding to have a fire station. In
 1948, following the formation of the  
 National Fire Service, Essex formed   
 the Essex County Fire Brigade. It was 
 decided that a fire station should    
 again be sited in Leaden Roding and in
 1952 a wooden fire station was        
 erected. Local men were recruited to  
 man the station, on a part time basis,
 and in 1953 the station became        
 operational. At that time they had a  
 Land Rover which towed its pump on a  
 trailer. The present station was      
 opened on October 27th 1962.          </content>
