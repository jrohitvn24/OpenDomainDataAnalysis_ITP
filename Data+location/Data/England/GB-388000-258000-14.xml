		<title>14THE ODDINGLEY MURDERS.</title>
		<content>   In 1809{George Parker}was instituted
 as rector of{Oddingley.}At this time  
 tithes were collected by the church,  
 which was usually one tenth of the    
 produce.When paid in money it was Â£135
 yearly.George Parker increased this to
 Â£150.There was an outcry and on the   
 24th June 1806,the rector was shot    
 dead while he was in the fields.The   
 murderer was seen to flee into Trench 
 Woods.Twenty_Four years later a barn  
 at Netherwood Farm was being          
 dismantled and a skeleton was         
 identified as{Richard Hemming.}Three  
 local men,{Clewes,Banks and Barnett   
 were arrested. It turned out that     
 Richard Hemming,who was hired by      
{Captain Samuel Evans}killed the       
 rector,but Hemming was murdered by    
 Evans.As they were both dead when the 
 skeleton was discovered no one could  
 be brought to trial for the crime.    </content>
