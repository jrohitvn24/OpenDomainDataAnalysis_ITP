		<title>03BURHAM - CHURCHES JOIN</title>
		<content> This development made a vast          
 difference to the people of the       
 village who had been used to their own
 buildings over the last hundred years 
 and prior to that the Church of       
 England still had their own building  
 down by the River Medway where the    
 original site of the village stands.  
 It was then decided to modernise the  
 present Methodist Church building     
 making it bigger and the cost to be   
 shared between the two Churches. In   
 May 1985 after the alterations were   
 completed the Church reopened under a 
 new name, {THE CHURCH IN BURHAM.}     
 This arrangement seems to be working  
 very well so far with both            
 denominations showing care and concern
 for each others beliefs.
