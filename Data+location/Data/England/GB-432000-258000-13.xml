		<title>13CHESTERTON MANOR HOUSE</title>
		<content> The original moated Manor house was   
 built next to the church.Behind the   
 church the sunken field was used for  
 tournaments.When plague caused the    
 village to move further up the valley 
 the tournament ground became the      
 village fish pond which can be seen   
 clearly nowadays.The new manor was    
 built on the opposite hill,and the    
 remains can be visited,although there 
 is little to be seen except the       
 surrounding wall,foundations and the  
 old stables which are now the         
 Humblebee Cotages.A tree lined avenue 
 led to the Lodge which is now a       
 thriving farm of over 600 acres.A path
 led from the manor,over the fishponds 
 to an arch designed by Inigo          
 Jones,which still stands ,into the    
 church.
