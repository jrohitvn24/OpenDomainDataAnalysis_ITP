		<content> The first settlers in Glosspdale      
 appear to have been the{Anglo-saxons} 
 ,one of whom -{Glott}- gave his name  
 to the valley.                        
 The villages which are recorded in the
{Domesday Book}are still easily        
 identified today.                     
 Glossopdale entered a period of       
 growing prosperity with the increasing
 demand for{textiles}in the 17th.      
 century. Its mountain streams provided
 the power for the early woollen       
 and cotton mills so that the area was 
 well placed to enter the age of the   
 true{Industrial Revolution}with the   
 invention of the steam engine.        
 With the decline of cotton Glossop    
 also entered a period of falling      
 population, but in the 1960s its{rail 
{link to Manchester}13 miles to the    
 west made it a popular dormitory town,
 with a{poulation}of nearly 30,000.    </content>
