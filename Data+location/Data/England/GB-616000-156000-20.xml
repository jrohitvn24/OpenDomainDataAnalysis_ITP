		<content>     {The Removal of Hedgerows}        
 The hedgerows are very useful to      
 animals,insects and birds.Int this    
 part of Kent many have now been       
 removed.Reasons given by the farmers  
 include the following - 1.they are    
 often keen to enlarge their feilds to 
 allow for easier mechanisation 2.They 
 suggest that hedgerows provide a      
 habitat for pests and diseases which  
 might destroy their crops.            
  One common hawthorn hedge was studied
 and was found to contain some of the  
 following plant and animal life -     
 1.common garden spider 2.money spider 
 3.long-tailed fieldmouse 4.blackbird  
                                       
 These are just a few of the animals   
 and plants which are endangered by the
 cutting down of hedgerows which is sad
 for us but more especially for the    
 animals that make homes &amp; breed there.</content>
