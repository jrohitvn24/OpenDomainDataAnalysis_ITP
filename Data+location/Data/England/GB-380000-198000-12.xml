 drill,a fertilizer spreader,a sprayer 
 to kill the weeds, a slurry tanker,   
 several trailers, a mower and a potato
 sorter, which sorts them into sizes.  
   The{crops}grown on this farm are    
 potatoes, wheat, barley and sileage.  
   The wheat has to be ripe and of a   
 high quality for selling. Before wheat
 can be stored it must have less than  
{16% moisture}and be very clean.       
 All of the milking cows are Friesians.
 There are{80}milking cows and{80      
 followers, which are cows from{2}weeks
 to{2}years old.After calving some are 
 kept and the others are sent to market
 where calves are sold for Â£100 and    
 cows for about Â£400.Pure Friesians are
 bred for better milk produce. After   
 cooling,the milk is collected by blue 
 tankers and taken to Stroud Creamery  
 where it's bottled ready for delivery.</content>
