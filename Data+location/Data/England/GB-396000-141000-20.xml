		<content> Situated on the boundary of the       
 Salisbury Plain Training Area midway  
 between the School of Infantry at     
 Warminster and the School of Artillery
 at Larkhill, the village is both home 
 to several military families and a    
 focal point for training exercises on 
 the Plain. In almost any month during 
 the year, most types of military      
 tracked and wheeled vehicle can be    
 seen on the roads and the village is a
 convenient reference point for        
 helicopters, ground attack fighters   
 and transport aircraft with paratroops
 exercising with the Army. Progress of 
 exercises is evident when north or    
 east winds bring the sound of heavy   
 guns at Larkhill, the crack of small  
 arms and mortars from infantry        
 assaults on Imber village and the     
 grind of tanks and personnel carriers 
 negotiating the gullies.              </content>
