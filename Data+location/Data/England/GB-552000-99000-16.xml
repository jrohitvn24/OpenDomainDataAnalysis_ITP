		<title>16The Hamlet of West Dean</title>
		<content> The small hamlet of West Dean seems to
 offer its inhabitants a high degree of
 contentment and satisfaction with the 
 quality of their lives in 1985.We     
 spoke to a number of people whose ages
 ranged from 12 to 80 years and were   
 struck by their lack of concern over  
 the limited range of amenities        
 available in their immediate vicinity.
 A community bus operates a twice a    
 week service to the nearby town of    
 Seaford;there are two daily postal    
 collections.Delivery of milk is made  
 but no van delivery of other foods.The
 nearest doctor is in Alfriston (about 
 3 miles away) and no library service  
 exists in West Dean.People valued more
 highly than amenities the sense of    
 being much more alive than when they  
 lived in more suburban surroundings.  
 The level of community concern for    
 neighbours seems high.                </content>
