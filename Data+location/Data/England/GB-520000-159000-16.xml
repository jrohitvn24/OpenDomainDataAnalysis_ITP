		<title>16THE SUPERNATURAL IN EPSOM</title>
		<content>{Lord Lyttleton's ghost was sighted in 
{Epsom on the 24th November, 1779 by   
{his friend Peter Andrews.             
 Lord Lyttleton was told by a woman    
 that he would die in 3 days. On the   
 3rd day he went to a party and told   
 his friends he would "bilk the ghost".
 After 11PM in the process of being    
 undressed  by his servant, William    
 Stukey, he gave a sudden gasp and fell
 into his arms dead.                   
 At the precise moment Lyttleton died, 
 Peter Andrews was confronted, in his  
 own bedroom, by a ghostly figure whom 
 he recognized as Lord Lyttleton. The  
 figure cried out,"It's all over with  
 me, Andrew." Andrews suspected a      
 practical joke but discovered the     
 truth the following day.              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
