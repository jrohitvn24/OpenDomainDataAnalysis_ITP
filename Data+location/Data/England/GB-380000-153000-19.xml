		<content> In Rode a doctor's surgery is held in 
 the Memorial Hall, every Wednesday    
 morning and a child welfare clinic    
 monthly. At other times, patients must
 visit the main surgery at Beckington, 
 where there is a dispensary. Meals on 
 wheels, i.e. hot lunches, are         
 delivered to the homes of the sick and
 elderly by the Women's Voluntary      
 Service. The British Legion drive     
 people to visit hospital patients. In 
 Southwick there is no surgery, the    
 nearest being at Trowbridge. However, 
 there is a  free delivery service of  
 medicines, by a Trowbridge chemist, to
 people aged over sixty. A child       
 welfare clinic is held twice monthly  
 in Southwick's village hall. There is 
 a district nurse and home help service
 for those who require them in both    
 Rode and Southwick.
