		<title>02Royston Street Names</title>
		<content>   Royston street names are interesting
 and tell us about the area in the past
 and the present.                      
   The main roads often tell us where  
 they lead-e.g.London Road, Baldock Rd.
   One of the main roads, now the A 14,
 has been called the Old North Road for
 hundreds of years. Stage-coaches used 
 to travel along it to Huntingdon.     
   Market Hill has been the site of the
 market since the reign of Richard 1.  
 Fish Hill used to be where fish were  
 sold.                                 
   Dog Kennel Lane is where James 1    
 kept his hunting dogs when he lived in
 the Old Palace on Kneesworth Street.  
   One of the newest roads is called   
 King James's Way.                     
   On one of the newest estates built  
 during the last 10 years all the      
 streets are named after poets and     
 play-wrights e.g.Burns Rd.,Shakespear.</content>
