		<content>    A few years ago when villagers     
 heard the{Jubilee Hall}would have to  
 close as the{W.I}could no longer      
 afford the upkeep, they decided to    
 form an association to buy the hall.  
    The{Hall}needed much renovation as 
 it had been bought in 1935 from       
 Darlington Greenbank Hospital and     
 erected and opened on King George V   
 and Queen Mary's{Jubilee.             
{  }Today the hall is much brighter,   
 warmer and more comfortable. There is 
 a thriving{Youth Club}; the Camera,   
 Art and Wine Clubs  meet here and the 
 W.I. There is also a popular Wednesday
 Club and Mother and toddler group.    
    On the south side of the village is
 the cricket field , which has pleasant
 views of the Richmond Hills. The old  
 cricket field was behind the village's
 only pub.Stuart Gamack, from Hilton,  
 captains the team of local players.   </content>
