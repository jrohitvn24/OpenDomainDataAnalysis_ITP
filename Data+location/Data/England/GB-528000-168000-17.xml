		<content> In a survey of boys and girls in our  
 class and their families (total 129)  
 we found that 75% live in our survey  
 area.  The commonest form of          
 recreation is swimming (45%) which is 
 well catered for. Thornton Heath Baths
 are the most popular, but many go to  
 more than one pool locally. Other     
 sports are also popular (37%) but we  
 found on closer examination that very 
 few people belonged to clubs or       
 organised groups, and played at home  
 or on the local recreation ground.    
 The other leisure activities were much
 lower in numbers e.g. 7% collecting   
 (mainly stamps/coins) and fishing 6%. 
 We noted that most recreation         
 activities take place in or around our
 survey area and that very few people  
 travel outside to well known beauty   
 spots, to London or to the South      
 Coast.                                </content>
