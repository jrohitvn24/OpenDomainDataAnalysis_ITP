		<title>01THE CROUGHTON AREA</title>
		<content> The 12 km block covered by this survey
 covers the southern tip of Northants  
 and a margin of Oxon, missing the     
 Bucks borderby 3/4km.  It is a rural  
 area, mainly farmland, containing the 
 village of Croughton, the main subject
 for consideration in this survey.  It 
 has not been possible to survey       
 Souldern, the village in the SW corner
 of our area, as it is far more remote 
 than mere geography might suggest,    
 being located in Oxon. Croughton is an
 ancient village - the{Romans}were here
 - and it was mentioned in the first   
 Domesday survey.  There are  some 1245
 inhabitants and 350 dwellings.  In    
 addition to the village, the US Base  
 located to the East of the area has a 
 flexible population, but 111 dwelling 
 houses and accommodation blocks for   
 200 personnel.                        
                                       </content>
