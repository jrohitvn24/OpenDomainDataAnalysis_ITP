   I live at Bolton Road, Aspull. I    
like living in Aspull,because I        
have lots of friends,and there is lots 
to do .Across the road from my house   
there is a common.In the summer we     
play  rounders and other games.I go to 
Aspull church school it is only across 
the road.From where I live it only     
takes afew minutes to get there.There  
are some shops up the road.There is a  
betting shop, a chemist, a paper shop, 
a laundrette  and a clothes shop.On    
monday  night after school I go to the 
high school to play netball.Then at    
6.15 I   go to a club called monday    
nighters, we play games and go for     
walks.On tuesdays I go to St Davids    
brownies it  starts at 6.00 and ends   
at 7.30. I like  going and Iam the     
oldest there now.On fridays I go to    
dancing classes there are four classes </content>
