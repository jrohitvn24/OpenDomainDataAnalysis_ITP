		<title>08Adisham Policing and Crime</title>
		<content>  There is a policeman who lives in    
Adisham village police house on the    
council estate. His duties, however,   
include the general cover of the whole 
rural district of Canterbury, done by  
car with others. This means that only  
a very small proportion of time is     
spent policing the village and makes   
it difficult for him to socialize. His 
home is open to callers who come for a 
variety of reasons.  Fortunately there 
does not seem to be much crime in the  
area. Burglary, car thefts and damage, 
petrol syphoning from cars and youthful
misdemeanours are the main problem.    
The villagers appeared to be satisfied 
with the policing. Some fears were ex- 
pressed regarding the future increase  
in the teenage population and the      
possible consequences on the peace of  
the community. Special constables      
living there do not normally police it.</content>
