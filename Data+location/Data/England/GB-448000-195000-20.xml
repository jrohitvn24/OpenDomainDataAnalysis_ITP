		<title>20ST. HELENS WHARF,ABINGDON</title>
		<content>This string of buildings consists of   
The Mill,The Double Alms Houses,The Old
Anchor Inn,The Stable,Long Alley Alms  
Houses and The Malthouse.St.Helens     
Church, immediately to the rear of     
these buildings,dominates the area.    
  Barges using the Thames and the      
adjacent canal,which used to run West  
to Wantage,would land cargoes of grain,
coal,seed,bread and general items.This 
made the Wharf the centre of the       
town's commercial activity,during the  
18th and 19th centuries.               
  The area now shows little sign of    
it's past importance.The Anchor Inn    
and the Alms Houses still perform      
their original function but the canal  
was abandoned in 1924.The wharf is now 
part of the tourist attractions which  
are so important to the town.
