		<title>05PROCESS TO OBTAIN CHINA CLAY</title>
		<content> When the decomposed granite is washed 
 out it is made up of three main       
 things,apart from the water.These are 
 the china clay,sand and mica.The sand 
 separates out fairly easily because it
 is heavier.Then the mica has to be    
 separated by a more complicated       
 process,using 'hydroclones'.This      
 allows the china clay to be taken away
 as a suspension.The residue from this 
 process is taken away to the mica     
 storage lagoon.The suspension of china
 clay in water is then gravity fed by  
 pipe to the drying plant at Marsh     
 Mills.At Marsh Mills the china clay is
 dried in stages to get rid of much of 
 the water and separate out the        
 different grades of china clay.The    
 best quality clay is then taken back  
 upto Lee Moor,where it is processed   
 further.
