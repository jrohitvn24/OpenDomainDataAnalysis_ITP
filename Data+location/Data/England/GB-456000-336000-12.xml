		<title>12A BUILDER</title>
		<content>    Mr. Lamb is a builder and builds   
 garages and extensions. Sometimes he  
 builds houses and has even built his  
 own house. He started building in 1968
 and before that he was a surveyor.    
 Then he became a policeman. He did not
 stay in the police force for long     
 because he would have to travel around
 much more and he did not want to leave
 Wilford.                              
    In his spare time, Mr. Lamb plays  
 bowls. He has won many medals and     
 cups. When his grandson comes up they 
 go fishing.                           
    He said the village characters were
 the two old Wilford families, called  
 the Carters and the Danns.            
    Mr. Lamb thought Wilford was much  
 cleaner than other places he has lived
 in. Mr. Lamb is a friendly man who    
 loves Wilford.
