		<content> In 1911 the  Clease Hall(2) was being 
 built. In that time the old Clease    
 Hall was in use as a school building. 
 The school would hold only about 100  
 children. In the school, you started  
 at 5 and left at 14.                  
 In about 1906 farming was done mostly 
 with horses. They used the horses for 
 sheaving and cutting the grass.       
 They used a horse sweep,but before    
 that,they carried the corn in wagons. 
 Farm barns were then called mohays.   
 The animals had to be driven by hand  
 to the market or elsewhere.           
 Camelford had its own band and used   
 to play in the Camelford Show.        
 Sportsmans used to be the work-house. 
 The Museum used to be the animal pound
 and where animals were bought and sold
 on market day.
