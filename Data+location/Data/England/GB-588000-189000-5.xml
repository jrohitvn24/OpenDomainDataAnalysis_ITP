 This farm breeds river trout,eels and 
 sells these plus shellfish.Further up 
 the Stambridge Road is the{Post Office
 and General Store.This is the only    
 shop between Canewdon and Rochford.   
 This part of Stambridge is            
 mainly ribbon development, but the    
 exception to the rule is{Cagefield    
{Road. }All the properties in this road
 are council houses built before the   
 Second World War.There are no special 
 occasions or traditions in Stambridge.
 It is a very quiet village. There are 
 two public houses in Stambridge. They 
 are situated at each end of the       
 village. One is called the {Cherry    
{Tree}and the other is called the {    
{Royal Oak.}They are both very old     
 buildings.                            </content>
