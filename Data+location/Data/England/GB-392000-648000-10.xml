		<content> Most farms have grain drying and      
 storage facilities which are needed   
 partcularly for Wheat and Feeding     
 Barley,but most of the Malting        
 Barley,Oil Seed Rape and Peas leave   
 the farm immediately after the        
 harvest. Following harvest some straw 
 which is not required for fodder or   
 for bedding is burnt on the field,this
 quick clearance allows an earlier     
 start to be made to Autumn            
 cultivatations. Due to increased      
 arable acreage there has been a       
 reductionin stock numbers.No dairy    
 cows or poultry are kept and there is 
 only one pig farm.Stock kept on the   
 grass include cows for beef production
 feeding cattle,ewes for lambs and     
 feeding  sheep.Hay and silage are con_
 served for winter feed supplemented by
 cereal by products.Most cattle and    
 some sheep are inside during winter.  </content>
