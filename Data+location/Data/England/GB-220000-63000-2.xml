		<title>02POPULATION IN TREVELMOND</title>
		<content> TREVELMOND IS A SMALL VILLAGE WITH 30 
 TO 40 DWELLINGS. THERE ARE ABOUT 5    
 HOUSES UNDER CONSTRUCTION BUT NO LARGE
 SCALE DEVELOPMENT IS PLANNED. MANY OF 
 THE HUNDRED OR SO OCCUPANTS HAVE      
 ALWAYS LIVED IN THE AREA, IF NOT ON   
 TREVELMOND. SOME HOWEVER ARE NOT      
 CORNISH.                              
  THE AGE STRUCTURE OF THE POPULATION  
 IS BIASSED TOWARDS THE ELDERLY,       
 BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO MOVE TO FIND   
 WORK. SOME YOUNGER PEOPLE HAVE MOVED  
 IN BECAUSE THEY CAN COMMUTE TO        
 PLYMOUTH OR ST.AUSTELL, BUT MANY OF   
 THE YOUNG LEAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE OR TO
 FIND WORK.THERE IS NO VILLAGE SCHOOL. 
 THERE IS A METHODIST SUNDAY SCHOOL,   
 BUT NO PLAYGROUP OR MOTHER AND TODDLER
 GROUP.THERE IS ALSO NO BUS SERVICE.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
