		<title>05FREDVILLE ESTATE.</title>
		<content>  The Fredville estate covers about    
 2000 acres and is situated in and     
 around the village of Nonington.      
  The name Fredville means cold place  
 and comes from the French "froid de   
 ville". There was a big manor house   
 there but this was burned down during 
 the second world war.                 
  The estate dates back to the eleventh
 century. The Plumptre family ,who own 
 Fredville today, moved into Fredville 
 in 1750. When the presnt Mr.          
 Plumptre's grandfather lived at       
 Fredville there were twelve children  
 in the family, that is quite a lot of 
 children, and he had to have a nursery
 wing built onto the house.            
  In Fredville Park there is an old oak
 tree,called Majesty, famous for having
 the largest girth measuring 11.60m.
