		<content>{ GAMES.                               
 We like playing games because it is   
 fun.Our favourite games are computer  
 games like Watchperson where you have 
 to go round a town without going down 
 each street more than once.I like     
 making dens and playing on machines   
 in amusement arcades at the seaside.  
 In the playground girls play hopscotch
 and skipping.When it is bad weather   
 we stay indoors and play board games  
 and cards.At Youth Club we play table 
 tennis,darts and bar skittles. This   
 latter game has a long pole with a    
 chain on which is a ball.You swing the
 ball and knock the skittles down      
 and score points.Adults like to play  
 bingo or darts.They go out at nights  
 to play snooker, badminton and squash.
 They meet at pubs to have a drink and 
 a chat.
