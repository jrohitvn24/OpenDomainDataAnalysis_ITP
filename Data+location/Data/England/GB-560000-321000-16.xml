		<title>16Shopping-Wootton,King's Lynn</title>
		<content> In our area there are{five small      
{shops,}which have generally been made 
 into small supermarkets and usually   
 belong to the Spar group.These shops  
 are used by the older people for the  
 bulk of their shopping because of     
 their closeness and also several offer
 delivery service.                     
 Generally the younger families either 
 shop at a large{superstore,           
 1ml.away(Rainbow)or at Tesco's or     
 Sainsbury's supermarkets in King's    
 Lynn.The Rainbow store only opened    
 last year and is gradually increasing 
 custom.                               
 King's Lynn provides a good centre for
 all other shopping plus{markets}on    
 Tuesday,Friday and Saturday but many  
 families from Wootton choose to shop  
 in Peterborough(Queensgate),Norwich   
 and Cambridge,2or3 times a year(which 
 are all approx.40miles away.          </content>
