		<content> There are 3 primary schools in our    
 area. Chilcompton has seperate Church 
 of England Infant and Junior schools  
 and Stratton has a  Church of England 
 Primary School. There also used to be 
 a Roman Catholic Primary school in    
 Stratton but this was rebuilt on the  
 edge of Midsomer Norton. A lot of the 
 children who go there are taken by car
 or by bus.                            
 The village schools are all old       
 buildings.  Each one has three        
 classes. We do lots of exciting things
 like cooking, gardening, pottery,     
 sewing, woodwork as well as science,  
 maths, English and computer studies.  
 We have lots of visits to places about
 the topics we do.                     
  At the age of 11 we go to  Secondary 
 Schools. Downside R.C.School is a     
 large private school. Their students  
 come from all over the world.         </content>
