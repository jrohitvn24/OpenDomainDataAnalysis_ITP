		<title>09HOUSING IN INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>  The housing in Ince Blundell is of   
 three main types semi-detached        
 cottages and houses ,modern terraced  
 houses and semi-detached              
 bungalows.Most of the cottages were   
 originally owned by the{Weld-Blundell}
 estates. The semi-detached  and       
 terraced houses which were originally 
 council houses are now privately      
 owned.The bungalows were built in the 
 60's and many are the homes of retired
 people.                               
   There are also some interesting     
 detached  houses , including 6        
 farmhouses. All these are privately   
 owned.                                
   Half the people surveyed lived in   
 the village because of family         
 ties. More than half had lived there  
 over 20 years.
