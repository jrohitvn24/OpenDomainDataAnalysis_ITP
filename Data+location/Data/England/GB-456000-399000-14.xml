		<title>14THE BALBY FISHERMAN</title>
		<content> My leisure time is taken up with      
 fishing. When I arrive home from      
 school on Friday afternoon I get all  
 my fishing gear ready to make an early
 start on Saturday. I have 4 fishing   
 rods made out of fibre glass and 2    
 landing nets for bringing the fish in.
 I have 2 keep nets to put the fish in.
   I go fishing with my cousin who     
 lives in nearby Hexthorpe. We have a  
 quarter of a pound of maggots each for
 bait. We fish on the River Trent in   
 Lincolnshire. My grandmother lives    
 near the River. We arrive at about    
 10am and always leave by 6pm. We catch
 different kinds of fish including     
 bream and roach. We do not harm them  
 and always throw them back into the   
 river. It's a grat sport and          
 recreation.
