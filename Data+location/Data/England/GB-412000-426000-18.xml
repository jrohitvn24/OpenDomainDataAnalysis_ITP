		<title>18LOW MOOR TRANSPORT MUSEUM</title>
		<content>   It is intended that a transport     
 museum be built in Low Moor.  The cost
 of the project will be about three    
 million pounds and it will take above 
 four years to build.  One plan is to  
 run old engines on the existing       
 railway line from Low Moor to Halifax.
 Another is to develop a line to       
 Dewsbury, but time needed to develop  
 this is a big disadvantage.           
   A local councillor who is backing   
 the scheme has reservations about     
 employing staff before the council has
 fully considered how the project might
 succeed.                              
   The first exhibits could be on show 
 in 1986 and a number of souvenir shops
 opened.  Some people think the museum 
 will be a white elephant, others      
 believe it will bring jobs into the   
 area and become a major tourist       
 attraction.                           </content>
