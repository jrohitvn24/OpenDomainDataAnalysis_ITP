		<content>    Because there are so many horses in
 our D Block there are lots of stables 
 and fields.  This area is a nice area 
 for riding. There are nice wide verges
 with lots of grass, the roads are     
 usually{quiet}and there are plenty of 
 bridle paths. For some bridle paths   
 you need a pass but most are public.  
 Another thing is the {motorists}are   
 polite.  They don't beep their horns  
 or any thing, they usually just drive 
 slowly past you.  There are lots of { 
{local shows}around, and there is a big
 one each year in Ulcombe which has a  
 lot of different classes such as      
 "Handy pony" "Fancy dress" "Musical   
 poles" "Dressage" "Apple and bucket", 
 "Minimus jumping" "Working hunter"    
 "Bending" and "Clear round            
 jumping."There are dogs in the show   
 too but they have their own classes.
