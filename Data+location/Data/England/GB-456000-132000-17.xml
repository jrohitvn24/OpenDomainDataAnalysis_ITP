		<title>17A WALK AROUND ALRESFORD</title>
		<content>    Being a busy rural town, Alresford 
 has many interesting features. Near to
 the Museum on Pound Hill is a building
 with 'false' windows, the top row are 
 Georgian but those at each end are    
 painted on!                           
    Walking up West St. we pass the Old
 School House Cafe built in the late   
 1600s. Further up the St. is the Swan 
 Hotel and opposite the Bell Hotel.    
 Both are old coaching inns dating from
 before 1552. The Community Centre is  
 Victorian and replaces the Market     
 Hall, now used for clubs, lectures    
 antique fairs etc.                    
    Turning into Broad Street we are   
 immediately impressed, there are      
 buildings of interest too numerous to 
 mention, but No.27 is Mitford House   
 birthplace of Mary Russell Mitford.   
    We can walk on down Ladywell lane  
 to the river, Fulling Mill and back.  </content>
