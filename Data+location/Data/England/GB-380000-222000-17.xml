		<content>FISHING BECOMES BIG BUSINESS           
 From March to May young eels, known as
elvers, make their way up the River    
Severn in their thousands.             
 Fishermen, usually working at night,  
use boats equipped with lights and long
nets to catch the elvers. They are then
taken live to special elver stations in
Gloucester or Epney, stored in large   
tanks and exported by air or road to   
the continent where they are considered
to be a delicacy.                      
 Ten years ago there was only a local  
demand for elvers, indeed fried elver &amp;
bacon omelette was a favourite dish.   
Sandhurst residents could buy them for 
65p/lb from fishermen. Now it is big   
business and local landowners complain 
of tresspassers and poachers crossing  
their fields with vans to catch elvers.
Elver stations now pay up to 250p/lb   
for the live fish.                     </content>
