		<title>12EDUCATION &amp; SCHOOLS</title>
		<content> There are no schools in this block,   
 the Bishopsbourne school having closed
 in 1951, and is now a private house.  
 Children of primary/junior age travel 
 to neighbouring villages, Kingston to 
 Barham and Bishopsbourne to Bridge.   
 The Education Authority do not provide
 free transport for children living    
 within 2 miles of the schools, and so 
 many parents pay for the bus which is 
 provided. In East Kent selection for  
 entrance to Grammar Schools is still  
 made at the age of 11. Grammar Schools
 (not co-educational) and Secondary    
 Schools, which are mixed, are avail-  
 able in Canterbury. Pupils travel by  
 public transport with free bus passes.
 Further examinations are taken at 16  
 (minimum school leaving age) and at 18
 for those entering further education  
 or vocational training. A playschool  
 for pre-school children is at Kingston</content>
