		<title>06Family Life in Salterton</title>
		<content> We interviewed a mother of four       
 children living in Budleigh Salterton 
 and she thought that the town was a   
 good place to bring up a family,      
 although houses are expensive and hard
 to come by,especially larger houses.  
 There are plenty of things going on in
 the town to occupy younger children   
 but not for the teenagers.There is a  
 well-run playgroup and the Primary    
 School is friendly.                   
 Jobs for older children are not so    
 difficult to find as she thought at   
 first.                                
 Bringing up a family is expensive but 
 living near Normans Store saves a lot 
 of money.                             
 Budleigh Salteron is a safe place to  
 live but some tourists are not very   
 careful.
