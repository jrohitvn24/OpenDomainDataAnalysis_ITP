 I went to a disco from 7.00 to 9.00   
 pm. There were flashing  lights and   
 good music.                           
 It cost 50p with rereshments.I met my 
 old friend Heidi.Regular jumble sales 
 are held in aid of various causes,    
 including the preservation of the hall
 and patients at local hospitals.      
 I have been to Wythall Institute for  
 Ballet exams.When I was called in by  
 the teacher,someone played the piano  
 in the big hall and I did my ballet.
