		<content> The two canals in our area are the    
 Stainforth and Keadby and the New     
 Junction they become one canal south  
 of Bramwith lock.                     
 The two canals have to be crossed     
 where ever one enters the village of  
 Kirk Bramwith making an island of the 
 village.                              
 An act of Parliament granted building 
 of the S.&amp;K.canal in 1809.this canal  
 is now only used by pleasure boats,but
 development of a terminous at Keadby  
 is planned.                           
 The N.J.canal was built in 1905 it    
 crosses the River Don by aqueduct and 
 was recently widened and electrically 
 operated canti-lever and swing        
 bridges have been installed.This      
 canaljoins the Aire and Calder and    
 then goes on to the port of Goole. .
