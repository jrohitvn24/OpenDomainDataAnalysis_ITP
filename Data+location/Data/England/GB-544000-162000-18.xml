		<content> Most people find Pratts Bottom small  
and comfortable.THere are lots of clubs
to go to.Most of them are in the       
Village Hall,which is conveniently     
situated in the middle of Pratts       
Bottom.                                
At the bottom of Rushmore Hill there is
a pottery shop for some souvenirs.Most 
of the houses are big and spacious and 
there is hardly any traffic.This makes 
it easy to play and ride bikes without 
getting run over.                      
The shops are nearby but they do not   
sell a wide variety of things.There are
stinging nettles everywhere.You have to
walk to most places.There are a lot of 
flints and sharp stones.If you are     
trying to dig you will find a lot of   
chalk so it is difficult to do         
gardening in Pratts Bottom.
