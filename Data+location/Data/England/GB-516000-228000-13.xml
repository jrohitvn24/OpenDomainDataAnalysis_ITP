    The River Oughton meanders along   
 the edge of the common, eventually    
 joining the  River Hiz. Trout,from the
 local trout farm, sticklebacks and    
 tadpoles can be found in the rivers.It
 is generally clean enough for people  
 to swim in. Birds such as Herons and  
 Kingfishers have been seen and        
 Mallards are plentiful.               
    At one end of the Common is a grove
 of Beech trees originally planted by  
 William Lucas in 1842. Dutch Elm      
 disease has eliminated many trees     
 approaching the common. Near the Beech
 Wood grow an abundance of Marsh and   
 grassland flowers.                    
    Two farms border the  common, one  
 farm using the river for drainage and 
 irrigation.
