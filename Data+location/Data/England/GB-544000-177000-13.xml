In my house you can't get any peace and
quiet. There's always babies crying,   
dogs snoring or my dad moaning. I get  
fed up and go upstairs. It's just as   
bad though because my brothers follow  
and when I tell them to go away they   
sit on the stairs and SCREAM! So in the
end they're upstairs with ME. My       
bedroom is quite small, the smallest in
fact but it's quite nice. I like laying
on my bed listening to my UB40 L.P. My 
room is square and a bit compact. My   
wardrobe is long and takes up a whole  
wall. I have quite large windows.      
My mum and dad's room is next to mine  
(just as you come up the stairs it's in
front of you.) It's much larger and    
long, my bedroom is half the size. The 
window in their bedroom is the same    
size. I go in there to watch the       
portable television.        MORE...P.14</content>
