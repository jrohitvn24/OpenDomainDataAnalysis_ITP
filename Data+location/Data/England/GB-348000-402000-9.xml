		<content>   Very little has changed in the rural
part of the area for the last hundred  
years.Crawford village is predominantly
terraced houses with large front and   
rear gardens built originally for the  
mining community. Most are neat and    
tidy reflecting the pride of the       
villagers in their community.          
   Some new houses are being built and 
others modernised. Within the Village  
are some large detached farm houses,   
semi-detached houses owned by the St.  
Helens Glass Company, and the Crawford 
Inn.                                   
   In the surrounding area you have a  
mix of detached farmhouses, some dating
back to the 17th Century and more      
modern brick built ones.               
   The 'Manor House', now in a poor    
state of repair, is the only listed    
building and dates back to 17th        
century.                               </content>
