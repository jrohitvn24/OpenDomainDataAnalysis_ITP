		<title>13Animals</title>
		<content> One of the fascinating features about 
 Brockenhurst is the number of animals 
 roaming freely around the streets of  
 the village. This is due to very old  
 established grazing rights going back 
 many hundreds of years. It is a common
 sight in the village to see {Horses   
{with foals,Donkeys, Cows, Bulls and   
{Pigs}striding purposefully up the     
 road. The animals are accepted by the 
 locals and enjoyed by the tourist.    
 They have a remarkable sense of road  
 safety but nearly 100 of them get     
 killed throughout the New Forest every
 year.                                 
 The local property owners have to     
 protect their property from the       
 animals otherwise they will destroy   
 the foliage.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
