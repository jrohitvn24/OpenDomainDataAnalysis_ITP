		<title>16SOCIAL CONCERN - TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>  ANOTHER LOCAL ISSUE WHICH WAS A CAUSE
 FOR SOCIAL CONCERN WAS THE SPARSITY   
 AND INFREQUENCY OF PUBLIC             
 TRANSPORT.THIS WAS AN ISSUE WHICH     
 PARTICULARLY AFFECTED THE YOUNG AND   
 THE ELDERLY. MANY TEENAGERS HAD       
 DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO THEIR        
 COLLEGES IN GUILDFORD AND FARNHAM.    
  RESIDENTS ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER
 THE NOISE, DUST AND VIBRATION CAUSED  
 BY THE HUGE LORRIES WHICH SPEED       
 THROUGH THE AREA CARRYING HARDCORE TO 
 INFILL A LOCAL QUARRY. THEY FELT THAT 
 THE ROADS WERE UNSUITED TO CARRYING   
 SUCH HEAVY LORRIES AND THAT THEY WERE 
 PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE         
 DETERIORATION IN THE QUALITY OF THE   
 ROAD SURFACES.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
