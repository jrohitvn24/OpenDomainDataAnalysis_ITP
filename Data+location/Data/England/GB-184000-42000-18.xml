		<title>18Where We Live</title>
		<content> Around where I live there are lots of 
 houses on estates but there are lots  
 of trees and open spaces too.There are
 quite a lot of oak trees around here  
 but not many elms now because Dutch   
 Elm Disease has killed them all       
 off.When we go out to play after      
 school we can go down to the park at  
 Malpas.They have got tennis courts and
 cricket pitches there as well as      
 swings.Just past there is the River   
 Fal and ships come up it to bring wood
 and sand to U.B.M.Harvey but they have
 to be careful because the river is    
 full of med and if they go the wrong  
 way they could get stuck.There is a   
 dredger ship which is usually moored  
 by Penroses and that scrapes up the   
 mud to keep the river clear.You can   
 catch all sorts of fish in the Fal but
 you need a licence or the Water Bailif
 will take your rod.                   </content>
