 IN THE LATE 1940s TWO MEN WERE WALKING
 DOWN TO THE ELLWOOD CROSS,THEY HAD    
 JUST DROPPED TWO GIRLS OFF AT MILKWALL
 AND THEY WERE ABOUT TO GO HOME.       
 IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT AND THEY WERE
 JUST ABOUT TO REACH ELLWOOD CROSS WHEN
 A SHAPE OF A FIGURE FLOATED ACROSS THE
 ROAD,THEN THE FIGURE FLEW DOWN TO     
 LONELY FARM,THEY STARTEDTO RUN DOWN TO
 MARSH LANE AND DIDN'T STOP RUNNING.   
            PHONIX PIT                 
 THERE USED TO BE A PIT CALLED "PHONIX 
 PIT" IN FETTER HILL,THEY FOUND A MAN  
 HANGING IN THE PIT AND THE STORY GOES 
 IF YOU TAKE DOG THERE THE DOG WILL GO 
 UP AROUND THE HILL AND THE MASTER ON  
 UP THE ROAD.                          
           FESTIVALS                   
 EVERY YEAR AT SLING THEY HAVE A       
 ROASTING THE PIG,ABOUT 150 PEOPLE GO  
 THERE ALL THE MONEY GOES TO CHARITY.  </content>
