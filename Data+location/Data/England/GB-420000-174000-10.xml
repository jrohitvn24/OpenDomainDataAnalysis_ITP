		<content> There are 23 houses in the South East 
 part of Ogbourne st George village.I  
 looked at the way the people were     
 employed and I found that 7 people    
 were retired from work and I couldnt  
 find out about 1 person.              
 Some people are paid for their work   
 and some people work without pay.     
 The people who work for money do a lot
 of different work, such as doctor     
 garage owner,steward,farmer,          
 secretary, gas worker and cleaner.    
 Most of the people who are paid work  
 outside the village in the nearby town
 of Marlborough.                       
 The people who work without pay are   
 mainly housewives or house-keepers.
