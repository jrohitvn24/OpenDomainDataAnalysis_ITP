		<title>06Mines Rescue Station</title>
		<content> Boothstown Mines Rescue Station was   
 one of the first stations built. It is
 the most modern of its kind in Europe.
 It was built in 1932. Most stations   
 were converted buildings, but         
 Boothstown was specially made. The    
 Mines Rescue workers job is to rescue 
 people when there is a lack of fresh  
 air. They take a medical kit and      
 amputation kit down with them. Luckily
 the amputation kit has never been     
 used. Their main aim is to rescue all 
 survivors. Next they put out all the  
 fires and then ventilate the pit.     
 Lastly they get out the dead bodies.  
 At all times even on bank holidays,   
 Christmas and Boxing Day, there is a  
 team of 6 men and at least 1 official 
 on duty. There is a bell in each house
 in Orchard Avenue, the street down the
 side of the station where the workers 
 live which rings in an emergency.     </content>
