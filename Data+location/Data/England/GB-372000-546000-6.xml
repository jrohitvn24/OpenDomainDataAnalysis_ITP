		<title>06Mining Alston Moor</title>
		<content> Alston has a long history of mining   
 and there is much evidence of past    
 lead/silver, zinc and coal extraction.
 Spoil heaps, mine shafts (currently   
 being capped by the{Manpower Services)
 and adit entrances abound.   Proposals
 this year to begin{open cast coal     
{mining}above Blagill have met with    
 mixed reactions by the local people.  
 While this may create a few vital jobs
 in this area of{high unemployment,}it 
 is feared that it will cause pollution
 of water courses and disruption of the
 water table, furthermore, the roads   
 around Alston were never designed to  
 cope with the heavy traffic that would
 be involved.
