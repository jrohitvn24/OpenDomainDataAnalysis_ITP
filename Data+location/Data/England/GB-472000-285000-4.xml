		<title>04The Cattle Market</title>
		<content> The first thing we saw were the       
 farmers weighing the lambs. This is   
 called{grading.}It is done by weighing
 and feeling the quality of the lambs. 
 While they are being graded the lambs 
 are stamped with green dye.Some lambs 
 had different coloured dyes on them   
 already.This is to show which farm    
 they came from.The lambs are split    
 into different groups by how much they
 weigh .If there is much fat the're    
 sold for less than if the lamb is lean
 .When we were there we saw some pigs  
 and cattle.Some pigs were being       
 brought to the sty.They smelt!When the
{auctioneer}is selling the lambs he    
 goes up in 10 pences.Once he's        
 finished he'll bang his stick on the  
 pens.After they have been sold,their  
 ears are clipped.Within 21 days thay  
 must be{slaughtered.}The pens are 1   
 metre high.                           </content>
