		<title>05TWO HEADCORN BUSINESSES</title>
		<content> Being in the centre of an agricultural
 region it is hardly surprising that   
 the most noticeable business in the   
 village is{Foreman's Agricultural     
{Merchants.}It is actually in the      
 centre of the High Street. It is an   
 old-established (1870) family run     
 business supplying seeds,fertilizers  
 and agricultural chemicals to the     
 surrounding area. The company employs 
 55 people and has 8 lorries engaged in
 distribution. There are some branches 
 elsewhere in Kent and also in Sussex. 
 Another company with a depot in the   
 High Street is{Woodcock's Haulage.    
 This is on the opposite side of the   
 High Street. 35 people are employed   
 here and 24 lorries operate carrying  
 almost any commodity,except bulk      
 liquids. Lorries operate 24 hours a   
 day and 7 days a week. Again this is a
 family business of long standing.     </content>
