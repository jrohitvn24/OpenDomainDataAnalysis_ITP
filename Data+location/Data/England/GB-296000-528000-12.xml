		<title>12Derwent Howe</title>
		<content> In 1981 this was a slag bank for      
 depositing blast furnace waste from   
 the Workington{Iron and Steel         
 Corporation complex at Moss Bay.      
 Cumbria County Council receiving      
 grants from the Department of the     
 Environment and the European Regional 
 Development Fund have began a major   
{reclamation scheme}of the 200 hectares
 of land.                              
 The old slag bank covered Chapel Hill 
 with 30 metres of waste. Today the    
 bank has been lowered 20 metres and   
 regraded to look like natural hills.  
 Derwent Howe will soon be a well      
 landscaped{industrial park}with       
 greenery, modern services and it is   
 hoped busy firms.                     
 Some of the{public amenities}will be  
 view points overlooking the Solway    
 Firth, a ski slope, car parks,        
 woodland and improvements to the Quay.</content>
