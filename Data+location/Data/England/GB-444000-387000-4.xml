{ }  Because we live in a rural area   
 there are a lot more lanes than main  
 roads.These connect the farms and     
 isolated settlements to villages.There
 are also quite a few footpaths which  
 run through the fields. Many are      
 clearly signposted.The only main road 
 in the area is the A618 which runs in 
 a N/S direction linking Whiston and   
 Aughton/Aston/Swallownest and the     
 A57.The most notable feature is the M1
 motorway which runs right across the  
 area in a straight line from East to  
 West.The M1 cuts through fields raised
 up on embankments and through         
 hillsides via cuttings.In the east of 
 the area the M1 links with the M18    
 which runs eastwards towards Doncaster
 and the A1,M62,Hull and the east      
 coast.
