		<title>05OTTERTON MILL (I)</title>
		<content>   The Mill is one of the most         
 interesting things in the village. It 
 is run by Mrs Greenhow. Otterton Mill 
 is on the way  into Otterton. It is   
 used to grind corn. It is on a kind of
 bridge across the leat( The stream    
 comes from the river.) The water is   
 controlled by 3 sets of sluice gates. 
 The water wheels are made of cast iron
 in two halves and are undershot. The  
 great spur and crown wheels are the   
 four surviving wheels still fitted    
 with wooden cogs made of apple wood.  
 Mrs Greenhow decided to open the mill 
 to the public because she thought it  
 was a very interesting place.The most 
 exciting thing was probably getting   
 the place restored in the mid 1970s.  
 She lives in the Mill House, just over
 the road from the Mill itself.
