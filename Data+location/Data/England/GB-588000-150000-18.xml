		<content>  The oldest houses in Lenham date back
 to the 15th. Century. They surround   
 The Square and the shops. This is a   
 Conservation Area.                    
  Three housing estates are situated   
 conveniently near the schools. The    
 private estate, south of Ham Lane,    
 where some commuters to London live,  
 adjoins the railway.                  
  Just across the A.20 on the Faversham
 Road is a small council estate and    
 a group of cottages. On the Pilgrim's 
 Way there are a few large bungalows   
 and houses.                           
  There are small numbers of private   
 houses along the four roads which meet
 in The Square.                        
  Outside the village there are several
 large manors including Chilston Manor,
 Royton Manor and Lenham Court.        
  There is an estate agent in the      
 village square.                       </content>
