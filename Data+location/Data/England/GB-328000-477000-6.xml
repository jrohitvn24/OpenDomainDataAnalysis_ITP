		<title>06Ulverston's Market Stalls</title>
		<content>                                       
   There has been a steady growth of   
 the street market in Ulverston;it now 
 occupies{3 streets}rather than one,and
 is held on{2 days}instead of one.This 
 has led to increased competition bet- 
 ween stalls and a reduction in profit 
 for some. Stallholders also complain  
 that the recent introduction of car   
 park charges has led to a decline in  
 their takings.                        
   In spite of these drawbacks,it      
 appears that little can affect the    
 spirit of these traders, as many of   
 the stalls have been in the same      
 family for half a century,and many of 
 the traders are prepared to travel    
 from Lancashire and beyond.           
   Customers think that Ulverston is a 
 friendly market and has a wide variety
 of stalls including fresh fish,fruit, 
 vegetables,clothing and hardware.     </content>
