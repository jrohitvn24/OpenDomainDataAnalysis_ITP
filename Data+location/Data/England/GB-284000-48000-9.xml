		<content> Near the water tower we saw a little  
 gate,there were long greenhouses lined
 up in the field.The greenhouse we went
 in smelt of warm,sour tomatoes,the two
 ladies who were working in the rows of
 tomato plants said they were picking  
 off the side shoots.There was an odd  
 tall,thin barn on the same path,where 
 a Dartmouth fisherman stores his crab 
 pots and gear.Further down the lane we
 climbed the bank and could see:-the   
 Dart up as far as Maypool,Dartmoor,   
 Torbay,Townstal and a lot of the      
 town.At the sharp bend of Jawbones    
 there are steep allotments overlooking
 the estuary.The gardeners on one plot 
 grow strawberries,raspberries,lettuce,
 blackcurrants,herbs,onions,potatoes   
 and gooseberries (not carrots because 
 of forkroot).Rabbits,magpies and      
 pigeons come over from the woods so   
 they have to grow enough for them too.</content>
