		<title>09HORSE RIDING IN L.STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> Being a rural area many families keep 
 their own horses and ponies. Children 
 join the local pony  club, Oakley Hunt
 North Branch, and take part in        
 gymkhanas and other events.Most owners
 keep their horses and ponies in fields
 by day and in stables at night. The   
 cost of a bale of hay for winter      
 feeding is 1pound 50p.                
 Fox Hunting is a traditional country  
 sport in this area.  The{Oakley Hunt  
 meets in Little Staughton once or     
 twice a year. The cost for the season 
 is 245 pounds. A "cap" for the day is 
 30 pounds. The huntsmen wear pink     
 jackets and top hats. The remainder of
 the hunt wear black jackets and stock.
 The ladies wear bowler hats or caps   
 and occasionally ride side saddle.    
 Other riders prefer to use the many   
 local bridle paths.
