		<title>04BROADSTAIRS AS A SEA RESORT</title>
		<content> We asked{residents}and{visitors}what  
 they liked and disliked about         
 Broadstairs.                          
 Most{residents}enjoy the beautiful    
 coastline and harbour.They{like}the   
 "olde worlde" atmosphere and are glad 
 it's not too commercial.They feel it's
 a peaceful,relaxing town with a slow  
 pace of living.It has arcades for the 
 young and deckchairs for the elderly. 
 Most{visitors}enjoy the summer sun,sea
 and sandy beaches.They think it's     
 quiet with nice pubs,restaurants and  
 clean beaches.                        
{Dislikes}include:-too many estate     
 agents and building societies;dirty   
 sea water;too windy;fouling of paths  
 by dogs;pavements too narrow.         
 Many thought it didn't cater for young
 people with no discos,nightlife or    
 fashion shops.Some of the older       
 visitors wanted slopes and not steps. </content>
