		<title>15Nuclear Waste:Social Concern</title>
		<content> Land owned by the C.E.G.B has been put
 forward as a possible site to{dump    
{nuclear waste.}This has caused a lot  
 of concern in the area with many      
 letters written to the press. The{    
{local council}mave many views on this 
 proposal. The leader of the town      
 council pointed out that one of the   
 main problems was in the{transport of 
{waste}to the site. Road or rail       
 accidents could happen away from the  
 site. Industry might not want to move 
 into the area if this waste is so     
 near. Many people would move out. The 
{local people will fight}to keep this  
 waste away from this area which       
 already has too much{dangerous        
{industry.}School children, residents  
 and many other local people have      
 already written to the local          
 newspaper.                            
                                       </content>
