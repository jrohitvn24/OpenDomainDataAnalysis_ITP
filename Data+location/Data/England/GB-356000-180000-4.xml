		<content>   My best toys are my roller boots and
 my "Get Along Gang" figures.  They are
 plastic and they are animals.  I like 
 my dolls.  I have three little ponies.
   They are plastic models with tails  
 and manes that you can plait.  I have 
 the stable and grooming parlour. You  
 can play with your ponies in it.  My  
 best game is "Pac-man".  You have a   
 plastic man and he eats all of the    
 marbles on the board.  I have         
 "Mini-Munch-Man". It is an electronic 
 game just like "Pac-man".  I have a   
 "Care Bear", it is a big yellow bear, 
 I like her very much.  I want to get a
 "Cabbage Patch Kid" for my birthday   
 and I want a big "Get Along Gang"     
 Teddy.  I have a telephone that leads 
 into my brothers bedroom and we can   
 ring each other up.
