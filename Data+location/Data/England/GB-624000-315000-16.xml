		<title>16HOUSEWIVES AND PENSIONERS</title>
		<content>   Our survey took place during school 
 hours.At most houses we received no   
 answer we concluded that this was     
 because both husband and wife were at 
 work.The houses where we did receive  
 an answer were occupied by either     
{housewives}with young children or     
 older{retired people.                 
   We questioned the children in our   
 school and found that nearly all their
 fathers were in full time employment  
 and many of their mothers had part    
 time jobs or worked full time.
