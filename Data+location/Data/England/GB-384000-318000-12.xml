		<title>12Haughton Playgroup</title>
		<content>A playgroup is very important for young
children because they can learn about  
and do many things  that would be      
difficult to do at home.They meet other
children and make friends.The playgroup
in Haughton is in the village hall on  
Tuesday,Wednesday and Thursday mornings
During the week 36 children go,there   
are 5 adults  looking after them.When  
we visited them we saw a lovely Wendy  
House,with 4 rooms,climbing frame,sea- 
saw,rocking horse,sandpit,trampoline,  
and dressing up clothes.In the kitchen 
the children were painting,playing with
pastry,drawing and glueing.They were   
able to choose what they wanted to do  
and were all enjoying themselves.They  
had a drink of milk and a biscuit      
before hearing a story and singing     
songs or playing instruments.Each child
pays 80pence a morning to go.
