		<title>04Marshside Marsh Birds</title>
		<content> There are lots of different birds on  
 the marsh. The most common bird is the
 lapwing. All these birds make their   
 nests on the ground. They lay about   
 3 or 4 eggs and half survive. The     
 other eggs get eaten by predators     
 which are weasels, rats and larger    
 birds. About three weeks later the    
 chicks get their body feathers.       
 Many of the birds are migrating from  
 other countries such as Africa, the   
 Arctic and Iceland. They use the sun  
 and magnetic forces. They started to  
 migrate to Marshside Marsh because    
 there is a lot of food there. The     
 birds eat snail-like creatures and    
 small worms with only scientific      
 names. The rarest birds on the marsh  
 are the redfooted falcon, sandpiper,  
 marsh harrier, knight heron and the   
 squaco heron.
