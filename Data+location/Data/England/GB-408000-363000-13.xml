		<title>13Tourists in Longnor</title>
		<content>     Longnor has a lot of tourists and 
hikers.  Many of the tourists stay in  
holiday cottages.  Some tourist        
attractions are the Microplant factory 
and Paul Eden's clock factory.  There  
is a small cafe called The Parrots     
which quite a few people visit.  You   
can also go to the Cheshire Cheese or  
the Crewe and Harpur Arms for a meal.  
You can also stay in the hotel at the  
Crewe and Harpur Arms or at the        
cottages next door.                    
     People usually come to Longnor to 
walk in the beautiful surrounding      
countryside, to fish or just for the   
peace and quiet away from the busy     
towns. There are at least four places  
where you can stay.                    
     People came from as far away as   
Australia, Switzerland and Germany.    
The rest come from England, Scotland   
and Wales.                             </content>
