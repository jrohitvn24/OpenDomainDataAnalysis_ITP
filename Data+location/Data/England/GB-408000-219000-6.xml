		<title>06Produce Show At Notgrove</title>
		<content> Every August Bank Holiday Monday the  
 Annual Notgrove and District Produce  
 Show takes place in the village hall. 
 In 1985 the number of entries and     
 visitors were up on the previous year,
 which well pleased the organisers. The
 format for the Show follows the usual 
 classes of entries in this type of    
 local Produce Show. There are fruit,  
 vegetable, flowers, preserves, wine   
 and confectionery classes as well as  
 hadicraft, photography and hobbies    
 sections. The children are encouraged 
 with special cups for their exhibits. 
 A Show such as this helps encourage a 
 standard of excellence in these vital 
 homecraft skills, as well as being a  
 social occasion in a small close knit 
 community. The childrens classes help 
 to perpetuate this continuance of     
 skills.
