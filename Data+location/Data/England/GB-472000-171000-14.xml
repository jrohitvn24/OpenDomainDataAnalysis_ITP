		<content>    My church is called a{Gurdwara. }  
 This is the name for a Sikh temple.  I
 go there twice a month.  I like going 
 to my temple because in the main room 
 where we pray there are decorations   
 hanging from the ceiling.  Also in the
 main room after the prayers have      
 finished you can sometimes get free   
 sweets.  Some of the children can play
 outside.                              
   Up stairs they teach you how to     
 speak,read and write Indian.  The     
 children can also play in the dinner  
 hall.  In the dinner room you can get 
 free food and anyone can help serve   
 the dinner.
