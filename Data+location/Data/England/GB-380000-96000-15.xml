		<content> Water Pumping Station.  Milborne St.  
 Andrew is situated in a valley on     
 chalk downland.  Under neath the      
 village is a large natural lake.  The 
 Wessex Water Authority have built a   
 small pumping station that is         
 automatic on the Milton Abbas road, to
 the north of the village.  This       
 supplies the local Express factory    
 with the required water supply.  The  
 village water comes from another      
 valley to the North West of the       
 village where there is another small  
 pumping station at the village of     
 Dewlish.  The water is very 'hard'.   
 Through the centre of Milborne Valley 
 runs a small stream each Spring time  
 and continues to run throughout the   
 Summer depending on rainfall, and the 
 height of the water table and the     
 underground lake.
