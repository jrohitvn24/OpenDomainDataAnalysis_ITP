		<title>10ANITA'S DAY AS MAY QUEEN</title>
		<content> On Club Day 1985 the people in the    
 procession met at the Church at 9am.  
 The procession started and it covered 
 about 3 miles, which I found tiring,  
 although I enjoyed it. Only the 2 non-
 Catholic Queens were crowned as the   
 Catholic Church has a different custom
 whereby its Queen crowns a statue of  
 Our Lady on a previous Sunday. After  
 the crowning ceremony the 3 Queens    
 laid a wreath on the village war      
 memorial and the 3 retiring Queens    
 laid wreaths on the crash victims'    
 grave. I had 4 girl attendants who    
 carried my long train of maroon       
 coloured velvet. My cushion bearer was
 smart in navy and white. My dress was 
 white and had 2 tiers edged with blue.
 The back fastened with tin bows and it
 had puffed sleeves gathered into a    
 frill at elbow length, also trimmed   
 with blue.                            </content>
