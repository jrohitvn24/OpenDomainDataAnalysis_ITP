{Hinchliffe Mill}and{Holmbridge}are    
 mostly surrounded by fields and       
 moors.There is a lovely view from     
{Cartworth Moor}of the area but in     
 Holmbridge there is a horrible        
 red brick estate.All the rest is      
 beautiful,there are fields,moors,     
 houses and our school (called locally 
 Dobb Top Primary School).             
 Most of the people work in Mills or   
 are Farmers on the moors.             
 A lot of Victorian houses have been   
 built on Woodhead Road, the{A6024.    
   There is not much to do in          
 Hinchliffe Mill.There is a brass band 
 that I go to and just down the road   
 there are 2 dams and 1 river with     
 ducks on them. The only place safe to 
 play is the recreation ground with a  
 big playing field, 4 swings and a see 
 saw.                                  </content>
