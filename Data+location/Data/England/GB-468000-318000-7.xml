		<title>07My Saturdays -Sian Humphreys</title>
		<content> On most days in the week my sister is 
 usually up first but sometimes I'm up 
 first.On Saturdays I usually get up at
 about half past seven and go and have 
 my breakfast.Then I go back to bed and
 read until about half past eight.After
 that I go out and play in the garden  
 or cook something.At half past eleven 
 I catch the bus and go to acrobatics  
 class.That starts at 12.15 and        
 finishes at 1.15. I catch the half    
 past one bus home.When I get home I   
 have my dinner and go and play with   
 one of my friends. I play with them   
 until about five o'clock.After that I 
 watch T.V. until bedtime.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
