		<content>The area is predominantly Protestant   
with the majority of people worshipping
at either the Church of England or     
Baptist Churches.                      
The C.of.E Diocese is Peterborough.    
Denton Rector serves the parishes of   
Yardley Hastings, Grendon,and Castle   
Ashby.Hackleton village does not have  
its own church but at nearby Piddington
and at Horton parishioners are able to 
attend services.Hackleton Baptist      
church is the Mother church of Denton  
Baptist church which was formed just   
over 100 years ago.                    
There is no resident minister and the  
church relies on members of the        
'Village Preachers Association'        
conducting the services every week.    
Roman Catholic Church members attend   
mass at Great Billing(Northampton).
