		<content>  The area is situated to the North of 
 Portsmouth. It is largely residential 
 with a mixture of open space and farm 
 land.                                 
  Portsdown Hill runs through the      
 centre from East to West rising       
 steeply from sea level in the         
 south to 100m, the land then          
 rapidly dips back to 30m above sea    
 level. The Portsmouth/Widley boundary 
 is to the North of the hill. In the   
 South a main railway line crosses the 
 area. Residential accomodation        
 consists of council and private       
 housing. The area includes a large    
 modern hospital complex, the U.K.     
 headquarters of an international      
 company, two Victorian forts, some    
 local shopping areas, a contoversial  
 modern housing development and a      
 unique viewpoint on the hilltop giving
 panoramic views.                      </content>
