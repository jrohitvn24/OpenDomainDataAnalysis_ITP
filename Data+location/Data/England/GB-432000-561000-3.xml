		<content>    Scattered throughout the area the  
 council have bungalows built for the  
 elderly tenants in the area. These    
 bungalows are situated in the streets 
 containing the other houses. Each     
 group of bungalows is watched over by 
 a warden living in the area and there 
 is an intercom system linking the old 
 person with the warden and also a     
 flashing light outside the bungalow   
 indicating help is required.          
    The council also have a sheltered  
 accomodation in  the area where the   
 residents have their independence but 
 at the same time help is always on    
 hand. There is also a private         
 sheltered accomodation in the area.   
 This was opened in 1981 and caters for
 single people and couples. The single 
 flats are bed-sitters with a kitchen  
 and bathroom, while the flats for     
 couples have seperate sitting rooms.  </content>
