		<content>{Nonconformity}was strong in the Parish
 of Steeple Bumpstead from the         
 beginning of the 16th century, and it 
 is interesting to note that the Vicar 
 of Steeple Bumpstead - Reverend Edward
 Symmes was one of the 2,000{dissenting
{clergy}who left the State Church of   
 England in 1662, although he did not  
 found a Free Church here. In{1760}a   
{nonconformist place of worship}was    
 established in a barn which stood on  
 the site of the present Congregational
 church. In{1789}the barn was bought   
 for Â£40 by Edward Fitch, acting on    
 behalf of the Congregation. In{1800   
 the barn was pulled down and a{small  
{chapel}built. In{1848}the congregation
 built the{British School}which was the
 first public school for miles around. 
{The present chapel}with its 70ft.     
 spire was erected in{1883.}Services   
 are held every Sunday morning.        </content>
