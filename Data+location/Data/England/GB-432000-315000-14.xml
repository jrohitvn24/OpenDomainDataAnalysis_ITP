		<title>14ASHBY TRAFFIC PROBLEM</title>
		<content>  Ashby de la Zouch has a major traffic
 problem,because two main              
 roads_A453 &amp; A50_converge in the town.
  A traffic survey was carried out in  
 1981,the results were as follows_     
   A453 from the south_8122vehicles per
 day                                   
        from the north_9240vehicles per
 day                                   
   A50  from the south_east _7023      
 vehicles per day                      
        from the north_west _7177      
 vehicles per day                      
   A new road is proposed to replace   
 the A453.It will be called the A42,and
 will be an extension of the M42       
 joining Applby Magna with the M1 at   
 Kegworth.                             
   There are no plans as yet to build a
 by_pass to replace the A50.
