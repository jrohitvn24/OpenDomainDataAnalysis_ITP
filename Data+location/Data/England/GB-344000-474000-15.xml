 Two long-established groups who have  
 provided entertainment for their      
 fellow villagers are the Hand-bell    
 Ringers and the Village Players.      
 Other groups include badminton,       
 cricket, bowls, golf, painting and a  
 village dance band called Quicksilver.
                                       
 Most of these groups meet in the      
 Gaskell Hall which serves as the      
 village hall. Most Saturdays          
 fund-raising events, mostly           
 coffee-mornings,  are held in this    
 hall.                                 
                                       
 The golf club is situated between the 
 railway and the Row. The bowls club   
 has a green off Cove Road and the     
 cricket club has a ground off Spring  
 Bank.                                 </content>
