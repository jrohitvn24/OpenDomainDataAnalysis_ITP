		<content> In Okeford Fitzpaine there is a wide  
 variety fo spare time occupations.    
 The sample of people I asked was      
 fairly small but also representative  
 of the population in the village.     
                                       
 The most popular spare time occupation
 was watching the television.  Many of 
 the people liked to go for walks or   
 cycling in the countryside surrounding
 the village.  Another popular hobby   
 was handicrafts, especially sewing and
 knitting among the ladies.  Other     
 popular hobbies included cooking,     
 reading, riding and playing sports.   
                                       
 Some of the people I asked told me    
 they had little spare time as they    
 were out at work all day.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
