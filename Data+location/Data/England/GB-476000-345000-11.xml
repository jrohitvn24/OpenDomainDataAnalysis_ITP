		<title>11The Chequers (public house)</title>
		<content> The Chequers is a public house.It is  
 on the corner of Toad Lane.A public   
 house is like a shop but you have to  
 eat or drink on the premises.The pub  
 sells soft drinks and alcoholic       
 drinks.They also sell food.The older  
 people come for company and a good    
 laugh.So do separated people.Most of  
 the people are over 40 but some are   
 younger people .There are 2 bowls     
 teams and 1 darts team.There are also 
 2 domino teams.The busiest day is     
 Friday or sometimes Saturday.You are  
 not allowed at the bar until you are  
 18 and you can't serve at the bar as  
 well,even for nothing.The pub opens   
 between 12.00 and 14.00 and at night  
 between 19.00 and 22.30.
