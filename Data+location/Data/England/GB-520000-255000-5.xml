   We grow all our own hay and after   
 harvest my dad bales the straw and    
 stacks it.We have three stacks each   
 year made of opproximately 6,000 bales
 each. We keep enough corn after havest
 to feed our own cattle all winter and 
 the rest is sold to make bread or to  
 be re-sold abroad perhaps some to aid 
 famine relief.
