		<title>07A FAMILY SUNDAY</title>
		<content> I am the first  up on Sunday. I have a
 wash. Then  I have cornflakes and I go
 to  see if anyone else is awake. I get
 dressed.  My  big  brother  Andrew  is
 next  up  he  washes  himself and gets
 dressed. Andrew  and  I go to feed the
 chickens.  My mum and dad get up, they
 do not have any  breakfast. They  wash
 and comb their hair. We come back from
 the chickens.Daniel gets up.  The last
 people to get up are the twins Patrick
 and Lindsey they are little babies. We
 watch the televison until dinner time.
 On Sunday we  usually  have  potatoes,
 carrots,  cabbage,  and a chicken. For
 pudding  we  have   strawberries  and 
 cream. Andrew and I wash the pots. We 
 watch a film on tv. We soon go out to 
 play. Andrew,Daniel  and  I play wars 
 until tea.For tea we have salad,cakes 
 and  icecream. We  play  cards  until
