		<content>   Hinde House{Comprehensive}lower     
 school is 29 years old and the upper  
 school is 21 years old. There are two 
 different blocks and 35 classrooms in 
 each block.{1200}children aged 12-18  
 years go to the school. There are{70  
 teachers. At lunchtime 350 people eat 
 school dinners. We went into the      
 assembly hall where there were lots of
 chairs and some people doing their    
 exams. We saw two shields and lots of 
 drawings at the back of the hall.     
 Their paintings were fantastic.       
   The building is very big and they   
 have a very big playing field too.    
 They have a very good football team.  
 It is the best in the league. Some    
 people go on at 18 to college and some
 do more training in engineering and   
 farming. We think it is good at Hinde 
 House and when we go there we would   
 like to be in their football team.    </content>
