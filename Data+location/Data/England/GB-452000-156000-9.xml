		<content>  About five twelfths of our area is   
 farmed by Kingsclere Estates Ltd. This
 is only half of the area of their     
 whole farm. Altogether they farm 2,000
 acres. The soil is partly chalk, and  
 the rest is clay cap with flints over-
 lying the chalk. They grow 885 acres  
 of wheat, 253 acres of barley, 170    
 acres of oats, 556 acres of grass, and
 there are 144 acres of woodland. They 
 have 350 breeding sows, 2,500         
 fattening pigs, 415 milking cows and  
 380 young cattle. The dairy cows      
 average 1250 gallons of milk per year.
  The farm employs 30 people, and they 
 use twelve tractors and two combine   
 harvesters. Farmyard manure from the  
 dairy and pig units is put back on to 
 the land, and some fertilizers are    
 used containing nitrogen, potash and  
 phosphates. The fields have hedges and
 fences around them.                   </content>
