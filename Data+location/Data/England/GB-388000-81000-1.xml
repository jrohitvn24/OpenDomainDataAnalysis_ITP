		<title>01Povington &amp; Grange  Heaths.</title>
		<content> This block is partially inside the    
 Lulworth army gunnery ranges and has  
 reverted to natural heath (except for 
 tank tracks &amp; targets).   The western 
 portion is largely wooded both with   
 conifers (squares 2,3,4) and mixed    
 deciduous woodland (squares 7 &amp; 8) and
 contains the only public road in      
 block.   The very steep ridge of the  
 purbeck hills crosses squares 9, 10,  
 11, &amp; 12 almost from east to west     
 standing 45 metres above the steeple  
 valley to the south.   Maximum height 
 is 60.6 metres at grange arch (sq 12),
 a folly constructed by the owner of   
 Creech Grance (sq 8).   At the extreme
 southern border of the block is the   
 tiny hamlet of Steeple (church in next
 block).   There are no amenities in   
 the block but a good deal of clay     
 mining - particularly in squares 5,6, 
 &amp; 7.                                  </content>
