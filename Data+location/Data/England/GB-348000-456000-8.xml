		<content> A new scheme at the university is     
 going to be sit up to help students to
 find jobs. It is hoped this agency    
 scheme will be in operation at        
 Bailrigg, Lancaster in 1986. the      
 careers advisory service are setting  
 up the scheme in a bid to help        
 employers find graduates with the     
 skells for the right jobs. The main   
 topics of discussion in the area at   
 present is the threat to the          
 university of the proposed financial  
 cuts by the Government. Over the next 
 10 years they will be awarding the    
 university 2% each year less in their 
 grant. This could lead to either the  
 closure of the university, loss of    
 departments or a reduction in numbers 
 of academic staff. The loss of the    
 university would be a catastrophic    
 blow to the area.
