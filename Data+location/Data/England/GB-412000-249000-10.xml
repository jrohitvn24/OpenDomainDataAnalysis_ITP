		<content>     Enid Blyton is a famous author for
 children of the age of 7 to 11.Girls  
 especially like her school books and  
 her mysteries are an all round        
 favourite.                            
     Roald Dahl is also very popular   
 and is well known for his fantasy     
 books which are enthralling for young 
 children.                             
   We went to interview a lady living  
 in Welford - On - Avon about her      
 favourite books.                      
     She likes reading Historic Novels 
 and Autobiographies - coming across   
 these books at school and enjoying    
 them.She was able to read properly    
 between the ages of five and six.     
   She likes the author Nigel Nicolson 
 because she can find his books        
 interesting in a couple of pages.She  
 considers reading to be a hobby.
