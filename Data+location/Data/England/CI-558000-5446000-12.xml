		<title>12THE HONORARY POLICE</title>
		<content>  My Dad is a Constable's Officer. He  
 has a full time job in an office in   
 St. Helier but for one week every     
 month he is on duty as a member of the
 honorary police of the parish of St.  
 Brelade's. He doesn't get paid for    
 the job, he does it voluntarily.      
                                       
  He goes out on duty from 8.00 pm-1.00
 am. Sometimes he comes home with blood
 on his shirt, it is normally from     
 teen agers having a fight. Also when  
 he goes out at night he makes sure    
 there are no cars parked where they   
 should not be. If there are he will   
 write out a ticket and place it on the
 window screen. He also gets called out
 on special occasions, perhaps to      
 direct the traffic at a wedding. My   
 Dad is very proud to be a C.O.
