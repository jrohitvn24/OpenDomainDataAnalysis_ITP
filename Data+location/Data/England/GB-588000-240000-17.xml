		<title>17Settlement Chilton Village</title>
		<content>The population of Chilton decreased    
from 260 to less than 100 as most      
people left in the early 20th century  
because their land was bought by       
landowners,but it has gone up again    
recently.                              
Chilton Hall was built in Norman Times 
and some is 13th century.It was known  
as Ciltuna in the Domesday vils and    
belonged to the Goldling family.It is a
moated farmhouse.Chiltons 15th century 
church called St. Marys has 15th       
century stained glass windows.Its      
parish once belonged to Great          
Waldingfield and was restored in 1868. 
It is opened once a month.An example of
housing is a Norman Chapel turned into 
a 16th century cottage and is one of   
what were many old houses with inserted
floors and chimney stacks.Housing has  
increased recently.
