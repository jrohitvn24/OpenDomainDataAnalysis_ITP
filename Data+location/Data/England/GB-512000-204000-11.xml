		<title>11ROYAL NATIONAL ROSE SOCIETY</title>
		<content> The Queen Mother is the patron of the 
 Rose Society,which was founded in     
 1876 on the outskirts of{CHISWELL     
{GREEN.}The society  provides          
{employment}for eleven local people,   
 five people work outside and six      
 people work inside. There are two     
 gardener's cottages on the            
 premises.The Rose Society is not a    
 commercial enterprise, the plants are 
 not sold to the public, they are      
 planted in trial grounds and may only 
 be visited. New rose trees are sent   
 from all over the world to be tested  
 in the trial beds for scent,colour and
 growth in the English climate. The    
 Rose season starts in mid June and    
 lasts until the end of September.In   
 that time 35,000 people visit the     
 grounds and 2,000 varieties of roses  
 are on exhibition.
