 There is one major activity in this   
 area of importance, and that is       
{agriculture.}Some of the steeper      
 slopes possess small grass fields     
 which are used for{horses,}the rest of
 the area is used for either{cattle}or 
{crops.}This area is all part of what  
 was once a huge estate, and many of   
 the farmers are{tenants.}An exception 
 to agriculture is a large sand{quarry 
 found in the north of this area. There
 is evidence of quarrying in other     
 parts of the study area but all of    
 these do not appear to have been used 
 for over 40 years or so. A problem    
 which the present quarry creates is   
{noise}and{air pollution}from the large
 lorries which transport the sand from 
 the quarry along the narrow lanes.
