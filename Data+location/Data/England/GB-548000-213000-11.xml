		<title>11Shops in Sheering</title>
		<content> In{Sheering}there are only four shops 
 - a grocers, a butchers, a            
 hairdressers and a Post Office.  At   
 one time the shops were all joined    
 together and the buildings are about  
 400 years old. A lot of the customers 
 come from Sheering. Some of the       
 customers are outsiders who are       
 passing through the village on their  
 way to{Chelmsford}or{Harlow.}They find
 it easy to park their cars and pop    
 into the grocers or Post Office to    
 make their purchases. Senior citizens 
 from Sheering use the hairdressers the
 most.                                 
 In{Lower Sheering}there is only one   
 shop which serves as a Post Office,   
 sweet shop,off-licence and grocers.   
 Five people are employed at the shop. 
 The fresh meat comes from the butchers
 in Upper Sheering and the cakes from  
 Hatfield Heath.                       </content>
