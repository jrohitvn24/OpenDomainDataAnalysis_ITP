		<title>16Fairfield  Hospital</title>
		<content> Fairfields Mental Hospital, originally
 called the Three Counties Asylum,     
 built in 1859 takes patients from     
 Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and       
 Cambridgeshire. It can accommodate    
 over 9OO patients.  In 1985 it had 65O
 patients, short and long term, ranging
 in anges from 17 to 92.  There is a   
 staff of 82O, 47O of which are        
 medical, the rest being               
 administrative, clerical and          
 ancillary.  The 1985 cost of running  
 the Hospital were Â£7.5 million.       
 The treatment the patients receive    
 depends upon the seriousness and      
 complication of their mental illness  
 but great emphasis is placed on       
 occupational therapy and if possible, 
 encouraging patients to live a full,  
 self sufficient life often in units   
 where, under the care of a warden,    
 they cater for themselves.            </content>
