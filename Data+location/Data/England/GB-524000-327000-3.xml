		<title>03Spalding golf course.</title>
		<content>      The club is for private members  
 only and has 650 members of all       
 kinds.Established in 1920, the very   
 attractive course has a full 18 holes 
 and is surrounded by mature trees.    
 Mr.A. Ward is the head greenkeeper and
 he maintains a high standard through- 
 out the course.   Every one of the    
 5807 yards is a credit to his care.   
 The standard scratch score for the    
 course is 68, though the course record
 is 65, by J.W. Spencer (professional) 
 and G. Palmer (amateur).              
     Green fees for a weekday are Â£6,  
 but Â£8 for a Sunday.                  
     Many local boys and girls make    
 quite a business of reclaiming lost   
 golf balls in the rough and in the mud
 of the nearby River Glen.             
     There is a well-stocked shop at   
 the club selling all manner of golfing
 equipment (even "found" golf balls).  </content>
