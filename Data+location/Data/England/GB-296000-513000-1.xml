 sub-urban,rural and industrial land   
 use.                                  
 The main features of our area are     
 Marchon chemical works,Mirehouse      
 Housing Estate of Whitehaven,Sandwith 
 village(pronounced Sanath locally) and
 the rural nature of the southern part 
 of the block which incorporates farms 
 and large mansion type houses.        
 The block is traversed by one main    
 road(A595) and the road between       
 Whitehaven and St.Bees(B5345).The main
 railway also cuts the block running   
 north-south,travelling through        
 Mirehouse and is the rail link        
 connecting Carlisle and Barrow.The    
 railway section in the block links    
 Whitehaven and St.Bees.Mineral railway
 lines from Bigrigg Iron Ore mines are 
 no longer in existence but the route  
 is still visible.                     </content>
