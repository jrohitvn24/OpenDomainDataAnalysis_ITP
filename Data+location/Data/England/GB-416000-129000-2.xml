		<title>02Laverstock Parish, housing.</title>
		<content>{ Laverstock village has changed       
{dramatically}since the middle of the  
 20c. The one time small village now   
 has such a lot of infill housing, that
 the character of the area is so       
 different. Such is the expansion,     
 particularly over the past three      
 decades, that the village is ever     
 increasingly  in danger of being      
 swallowed up by its larger neighbour. 
 Most of the housing and schools have  
 been built since the end of the 2nd   
 World war. To the south of the block  
 there is one small hamlet of some 20  
 houses and known as Petersfinger.     
 There is no clear reason for the name,
 though some claim the road pattern is 
 likened to the Apostle's crooked digit
 pointing towards the spire of         
 Salisbury Cathedral seen on the       
 skyline. The most recent residential  
 development is in the N.E. corner.    </content>
