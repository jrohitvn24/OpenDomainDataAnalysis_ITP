		<content> Huntroyde Desmesne was part of the{   
{Honour of Clitheroe}granted to Roger  
 of Poiton after the Norman Conquest.  
 The land was used for hunting and in  
 1464 came into the possession of      
 Edmund Starky, "in right of his wife, 
 Elizabeth of Symondstone", and has    
 belonged to the Starkie family ever   
 since.  During the civil war the      
 family took the Parliamentarian side  
 and were responsible for raising the  
 local militia.  They have provided    
 five{Sheriffs of Lancashire}and been  
 benefactors to the town of Padiham.   
 Over the centuries the use of the land
 has changed and now 85% is used for   
 dairy farming and the rest for sheep. 
 There is a Home Farm and several      
 cottages and houses. In 1983 the      
 Starkies left{Huntroyde Hall,}which is
 now divided into two residences, and  
 the land is managed by an agent.      </content>
