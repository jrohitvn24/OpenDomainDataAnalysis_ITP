		<title>11FARMING 1</title>
		<content> As there are many farms in our        
 area, most of the land is farmland and
 most of the farmland is{grassland     
 which cows and sheep graze on. Some of
 it, though, is made into hay and      
 cultivated. The fields are contained  
 by hedges but the hedges are slowly   
 being taken down to make bigger fields
 with fences so that animals cannot    
 stray into other farmers'land. A very 
 small area of the land belongs to     
 Seale{Hayne Agricultural College}and  
 about six acres belong to the{English 
{China Clay}pits. Trees are being      
 knocked down too, because some are in 
 the middle of fields which mean people
 have to go round them when making hay 
 or ploughing so they "lose" some land 
 All the farmers have modern farming   
 implements.
