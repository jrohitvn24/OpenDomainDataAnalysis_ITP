		<title>06Farming - Broxwood Area</title>
		<content> This is a fertile area with a mild    
 climate, made up principally of good  
 leys ideal for growing many different 
 crops including wheat, barley, oats,  
 maize, hops, oil seed rape, potatoes, 
 sprouts and beans. The area also      
 cultivates soft fruits such as        
 strawberries, blackcurrants and       
 gooseberries and has orchards which   
 contain both desert and cider apples. 
                                       
 Stock herds are predominantly Hereford
 crossed cattle, with Charolais and    
 Limousin crosses as well. The dairy   
 herds are mainly Friesians. The world 
 famous Haven Herefords are in this    
 area and bulls are exported to USA,   
 Canada, Africa, Australia and         
 Scandinavia. It is also a good area   
 for sheep with a pedigree flock of    
 Clun and many commercial flocks with  
 predominately Suffolk rams.           </content>
