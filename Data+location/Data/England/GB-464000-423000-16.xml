 The dining room shows good Chippendale
 furniture. The chimney piece is       
 decorated with portraits of ancestors.
 The chapel is still usable and has    
 Flemish carved wood panels showing the
 beheading of John the Baptist.        
 The gold faced clock is wound up each 
 week by hand.The servants' quarters   
 show how well they used to be looked  
 after.                                
 The family still visit the Towers,    
 often bringing friends to stay.       
 Still with its periodic furniture,    
 Carlton Towers is a good example of a 
 Victorian stately home.It is open to  
 the public on bank holidays and at    
 weekands.
