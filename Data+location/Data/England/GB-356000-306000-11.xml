		<content>  There are only two churches in the   
 area, one in Eaton Constantine and one
 in Wroxeter. The Eaton Constantine    
 church is a small church built in 1850
 to replace an earlier building on the 
 same site. There are Church of England
 services each Sunday lead by the Vicar
 who lives in the village. He is also  
 in charge of worship in other villages
 nearby.                               
  The church at Wroxeter is a much     
 older and more beautiful building but 
 is no longer used as it is unsafe.    
 As there are so few people in the area
 to use this church it will be         
 repaired but not used for regular     
 worship.                              
  People of other religious groups have
 to travel to the nearby towns or      
 Shrewsbury or Telford to go to Church.
