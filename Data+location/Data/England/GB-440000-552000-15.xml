		<title>15Leisure Activities in Ryhope</title>
		<content>    Many of the children belong to     
 the local branches of Cubs, Scouts,   
 Boys' Brigade, Brownies or Guides and 
 there are also{Sunday Schools}and     
 church adventure clubs.               
    We discovered that grown-ups do not
 seem to like doing energetic things.  
 They are quite happy going to the     
 local branch{library}or to the large  
{bingo hall,}growing vegetables to     
 enter in shows, breeding racing       
 pigeons, or spending their evenings in
 a pub or club which often has live    
 entertainment like pop groups or      
 comedians.                            
    Most people that we asked said     
 that there weren't enough{leisure     
{facilities}in our area. Many thought  
 that we should have a  decent park    
 and that the recreation park should be
 improved and a lot of us wish there   
 was a cinema for us to enjoy.         </content>
