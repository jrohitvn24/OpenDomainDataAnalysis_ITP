		<title>12QUAY LANE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content>{Quay Lane Industrial Estate}is one of 
 several industrial estates            
 administered by Gosport Borough       
 Council.  It consists of twenty four  
 units which are currently occupied by 
 thirteen companies.  Four units are   
 presently vacant.  The occupants      
 include a coach depot, furniture      
 manufacturer, plastics manufacturer,  
 several motor engineers, a tent       
 manufacturer, a scrap metal dealer and
 a boatyard.  A number of the companies
 have been at Quay Lane for several    
 years and are permanently based there.
 The industrial estate also houses a   
 number of one or two man firms who are
 just starting out.  Many firms start  
 in this way and then successfully     
 expand to larger, more permanent      
 premises elsewhere.
