		<title>19NIGHTLIFE FOR THE ADULTS</title>
		<content> These days it seems that many adults  
 spend a lot of time in the Pub. Hull  
 is a funny place for Pubs as there are
 only 3 main breweries who own most of 
 them; Bass, Tetleys and North Country.
 This last one has been taken over by  
 the Mansfield Brewery.                
 But what happens after closing time,  
 there is a choice of clubs ranging    
 from Romeos and Juliets to the        
 Waterfront  club, there is also a     
 casino.                               
 For those who like Cinema there are 2 
 multi-screen cinemas plus the Hull    
 film theatre based at the Central     
 Library.                              
 Theatre is represented by the New     
 Theatre which is undergoing a multi-  
 million pound refit at the moment.    
 And lastly the Spring Street theatre  
 home of the Hull Truck theatre        
 company.                              </content>
