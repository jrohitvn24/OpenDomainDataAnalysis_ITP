		<title>05THE NURSERY AT RISELEY</title>
		<content>                                       
      Mr. Wilkinson owns and runs a    
 flower nursery business in Riseley.   
      In the l940's the farm was bought
 by Mr. Wilkinson's father.  Three     
 years later he established some       
 greenhouses on some of the land to    
 produce flowers for the florists'     
 trade.  In the l950's these had       
 become so successful that it became a 
 separate business and the present Mr. 
 Wilkinson took them over when he was  
 20.                                   
      There are two and a half acres of
 greenhouses altogether.  Three men and
 six women are full time workers,      
 planting, pricking and disbudding     
 carnations, chrysanthemums and        
 alstameria.  (cont)
