		<content> There are in fact 53 old houses in the
 village of Shere. Many are timber     
 framed. Those in the centre of the    
 village were built mainly in the 16th 
 and 17th century. We have chosen to   
 write about a few of them.            
 We looked at the Old Forge and the Old
 Prison in Lower Street. Both these    
 were built in the early 17th century. 
 The Forge was once used as a          
 wheelwrights. The Old Prison still has
 bars on the front window, but today it
 is someones house.                    
 In the centre of Shere next to the    
 Tillingbourne stream in Middle Street 
 there is The Pound. This used to be   
 used as an enclosure for animals when 
 farmers brought them to the village.  
 Today it is often used at the weekends
 by people selling refreshments for    
 charity or by visitors sitting on the 
 seat in the Pound,enjoying the view.  </content>
