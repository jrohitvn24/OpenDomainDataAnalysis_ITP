		<title>04 Church Life in Wilby</title>
		<content> Like other village churches in the    
area Wilby church has suffered from a  
decline in attendance at its services. 
Out of a population of over 500 people 
only about 20 attend the Sunday morning
service.  Since 1962 Wilby has not had 
its own rector,but shares one with a   
neighbouring parish in Wellingborough. 
He spends 1&amp;1/2 days in Wilby and the  
rest of the time in Wellingborough.    
 There is a small{ Sunday school} with 
about 12 children,a{ small choir} of 4 
or 5 singers and a team of{ bell       
ringers} to ring the 6 bells of the    
tower. There is a {Women's Fellowship} 
which meets regularly and also         
arranges the church cleaning and       
flower decorations.  The church is     
expensive to run, especially for a     
small congregation and a large sum of  
money will have to be raised to carry  
out repairs to preserve this church.   </content>
