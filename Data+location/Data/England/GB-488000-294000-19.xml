		<title>19A GRETTON SCRIPT-WRITER</title>
		<content>   Colin Bostock-Smith is a radio and  
television script-writer living in     
Gretton. On a typical day in his       
working week, he starts by watching    
some of his programmes on video tape   
whilst having his breakfast. On the    
particular day he was interviewed, he  
was expecting a visit from the director
of a new programme shortly to be       
produced for Television South. Normally
Colin works during the morning and part
of the afternoon. Then he likes to play
a round of golf on Corby's Municipal   
Golf Course. He starts work on his     
script-writing again at about 1700hrs. 
Late in the evening, he likes to go to 
Gretton's oldest public house, the     
Hatton Arms, for a drink with his      
friends. He says he splits his day up  
like this so that he can concentrate   
hard for a while and then relax.
