		<content> The Malvern Hills, maintained by the  
 Malvern Hills Conservators, attract   
 much interest among tourists. Chase   
 End Hill is the most southerly and the
 smallest of the chain and is littered 
 with bomb craters and old quarry      
 workings. Raggedstone Hill is the next
 in the chain, on the western of its   
 twin peaks is Red Earl's Dyke, which  
 is cut out of solid rock. Eastnor     
 Castle is a large house, built in 1812
 in the style of a castle. The building
 houses a collection of armour and     
 animal heads and is open to the public
 on Sundays and Bank Holidays. The     
 grounds and castle are often used by  
 the television industry. Eastnor      
 Estate provides caravan facilities and
 also hosts other attractions.         
 Bromesberrow Place is open twice a    
 year to enable the public to view the 
 Nurseries and the orchid collection.  </content>
