		<title>12PADSTOW SEA CADET CORPS</title>
		<content> Padstow Sea Cadets are moving into    
 their new headquarters this year.The  
 building cost Â£53,000 and we raised   
 quite a bit ourselves through events  
 such as Bingos,a Teddy Bear Stall and 
 raffling a painting all last summer.We
 meet every Friday and learn all about 
 seamanship, I like swimming and       
 sailing best but I don't like cleaning
 the boats.We wear a uniform similar to
 the Royal Navy and we have to make    
 sure it is well turned out for our    
 inspection.The best Cadets each year  
 win a week's trip on a large sailing- 
 ship, putting all they have learnt to 
 practical use.We compete against other
 Cadet Corps in various competitions   
 including survival courses on Dartmoor
 and rowing.We are called T.S.St.Petroc
 after the saint from whom Padstow is  
 named.We are one of the few groups    
 privileged to fly the Blue Ensign.    </content>
