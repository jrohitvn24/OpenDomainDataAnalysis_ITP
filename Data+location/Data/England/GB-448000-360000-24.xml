<title>24NEWSPAPERS IN MANSFIELD</title>
<content>NEWSPAPERS IN MANSFIELD&lt;br />&lt;br />The CHAD continues as the main newspaper for Mansfield and now costs 70 pence.  The majority of the newspaper can now be viewed online and certain reports, as chosen by the Editor, can be commented on by readers.  This is called blogging.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Recorder is no longer in existence.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Observer is now a very thin, free paper which is full of mainly adverts with an occasional story (often duplicated from the CHAD).&lt;br />&lt;br />Radio Mansfield - which was founded in 2006 - now broadcasts on 103.2 FM and carries local news and sport and is partly funded by local businesses adverts.&lt;br />
