		<content> Our survey area was divided equally   
 between three schools.The schools     
 involved were Cookridge               
 Primary,Broadgate Junior and Moorlands
 Preparatory School&lt;Private>.This      
 selecting of schools meant a variety  
 of age ranges were involved,Cookridge 
 8-9yrs,Broadgate 10-11yrs and         
 Moorlands 11-13yrs.A variety of topics
 and information were covered, each    
 school being left to organise its own 
 interests and surveys. Unfortunately  
 Moorlands School were unable,for      
 reasons best known to themselves,to   
 complete the counts and surveys       
 necessary and therefore the Land Cover
 Survey and facility count are both    
 incomplete for the overall area.The   
 page responsibilities are as          
 follows:Broadgate pages 2-8,Cookridge 
 pages 9-14 and Moorlands pages 15-20.
