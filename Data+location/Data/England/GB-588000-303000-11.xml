		<title>11FARMING IN ASHILL</title>
		<content> Unlike the past, villages of today are
 not centred around farming. Modern    
 machinery has meant that{less people  
{are employed,}and for more convenience
 fields have been made larger with the 
 removal of hedges, woods etc, much to 
 the annoyance of the environmentalists
 Improved plant breeding, liberal use  
 of{chemicals and fertilizers}with     
 advice from agronomists,has caused    
 crop {yields to double}in the past    
 decade,thus giving large surpluses,   
 which have to be stored at great cost 
 to the taxpayers. Although food today 
 is of{very high quality,}many people  
 are angered at the way in which some  
 food is produced, eg:- eggs laid by   
 battery chickens, and pigs, cattle &amp;  
 poultry fattened intensively.A farmers
 opinion:- "If industry &amp; commerce had 
 progressed as fast as farming the     
 country would be far better off today"</content>
