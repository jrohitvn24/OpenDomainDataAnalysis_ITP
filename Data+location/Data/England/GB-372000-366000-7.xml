		<content>      We did two traffic counts, one of
 20 minutes outside our school,when we 
 counted some 70 vehicles passing along
 the A50. The second count we did at   
 junction 18 when we counted 307       
 northbound and 317 southbound vehicles
 in 10 minutes!                        
      The largest number of vehicles on
 the M6 was cars, but there were also  
 160 lorries. These would not only be  
 very noisy but also extremely         
 dangerous if they were passing our    
 school.                               
      Although our area has these major
 roads we have a very poor public      
 transport service. The nearest station
 is in Holmes Chapel and there are only
 a few buses each week. As most people 
 work away from Cranage, or live on    
 outlying farms most people have at    
 least one car.
