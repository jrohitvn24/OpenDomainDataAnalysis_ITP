		<content>  Little Kingshill School is a combined
 school with a nursery attached.There  
 are 315 children at the main school   
 with eleven full-time teachers, a     
 secretary and welfare assistants.The  
 ages range from three in the nursery  
 to twelve in the main school.         
  The school now has a cash cafeteria  
 at lunch time which the children      
 enjoy.The younger ones have lunch at  
 12.00 and the older ones take it in   
 turn later on; some children take     
 sandwiches.                           
  The school has two adventure         
 playgrounds,one for the first school, 
 and one for the middle.There are also 
 three playgrounds and a large field   
 but the field can only be used for    
 playtime when the weather has been    
 dry.                                  
  The children wear school uniform     
 which is basically red and grey.      </content>
