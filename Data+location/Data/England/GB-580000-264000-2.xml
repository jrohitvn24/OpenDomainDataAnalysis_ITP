		<content>  The area is predominantly            
agricultural, with the emphasis on     
arable farming. The types of crops     
grown are cereals (wheat and barley),  
root crops (sugar beet) and oilseed    
rape. Farming is highly mechanised     
and the land is intensively farmed.    
The average 100 hectare farm would     
employ no more than four or five men.  
Fields are increasingly being          
incorporated into single large units   
and hedgerows and other traditional    
field boundaries are disappearing. One 
part of the survey area is unusual for 
this part of Suffolk, in that it       
consists of fruit orchards which are   
more typical towards Cambridgeshire    
and the Essex border.
