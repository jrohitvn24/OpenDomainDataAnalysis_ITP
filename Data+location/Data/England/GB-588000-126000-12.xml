		<title>12Marbles</title>
		<content>  Sometimes we play {Marbles,}these are
 little glass balls with different     
 colours in them.  You can get Dobbers 
 which are big marbles, King Dobbers   
 which are very big, Ordinaries which  
 are quite small and quite a few       
 others.  This is how you play:  You   
 need a marble and a friend with the   
 same sort of marble.  You tap marbles 
 with your friend and say,"Once once   
 keepsies, only rolls in the game",    
 (this means that you can only roll the
 marbles not bomb them).  You roll your
 marble and the other person has to    
 roll theirs and try to hit it; you    
 take turns to roll the marbles and    
 whoever hits the opponent's marble    
 keeps both marbles.                   
  If you only want to practise, you    
 say,"Once once practices, only rolls  
 in the game".  But then you don't have
 to play it at all!                    </content>
