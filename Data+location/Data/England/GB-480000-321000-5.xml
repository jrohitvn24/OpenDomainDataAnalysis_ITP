		<content> As with many rural areas, relatively  
 unspoilt countryside has become the   
 location for the administrative       
 offices of a major industrial concern.
 Pedigree Petfoods (part of the Mars   
 Group) the largest producer of pet    
 food in the U.K. with 70% of the      
 domestic market, has its National     
 Office near Waltham Lodge. Recently   
 extended, the new buildings have been 
 designed to blend in with the         
 countryside having been landscaped so 
 as to be as inobtrusive as possible.  
 Some of the local residents do not    
 agree that this aim has been achieved.
 Close to the offices is the Animal    
 Studies Centre, claimed by Pedigree   
 Petfoods to be the world's formost    
 authority on pet nutrition.           
 Nutritional analysis, biochemistry,   
 behavioural research and animal       
 husbandry are studied here.           </content>
