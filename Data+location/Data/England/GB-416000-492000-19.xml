		<title>19Steam Rally in Hunton</title>
		<content>     It is a fine September morning  in
 Hunton.There is an unusually expectant
 and busy atmosphere.  Veteran cars and
 motor bikes,old steam engines and farm
 machinery  have  already  assembled in
 the fields behind Manor House Farm. It
 is our first ever "Steam Rally Day!"  
      Numerous  volunteer  ladies  have
 provided food for the produce and cake
 stalls and  afternoon teas.  Morrismen
 are keen to dance. Local men and women
 are ready to show their skills at lace
 making, woodturning,  machine knitting
 and painting. Work begins on engraving
 glass,plaiting corn dollies or carving
 walking sticks. Children will flock to
 the mini_motor bikes,shooting gallery,
 horse rides or bouncy castle.  Parents
 will try their hand at wellie throwing
 or quoits on the three pitches.       
    The stage is set for a successful  
 and happy day.                        </content>
