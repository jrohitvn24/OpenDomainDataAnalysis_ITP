		<content>   Our area includes the Hyde-Park &amp;   
 Park Hill development which became    
 famous in the post-war period. These  
 two enormous blocks of{flats}contain  
 2,317 dwellings with shops, schools   
 and high level streets.               
   Many of the older{terraced houses}in
 the area are being pulled down and    
 replaced with low-level family houses 
 and parkland.Large tracts of land     
 stand derelict awaiting{council       
{decisions}on the future.              
   Most of the houses in Attercliffe &amp; 
 Darnall are Corporation owned though a
 few private estates, such as the      
 Littledale estate, cater for those    
 wanting a modestly priced semi-       
 detatched home. Terraced rows of poor 
 quality houses are gradually being    
 replaced by{modern estates}of mixed   
 homes.
