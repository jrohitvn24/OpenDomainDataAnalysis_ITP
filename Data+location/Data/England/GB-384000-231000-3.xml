		<title>03EMPLOYMENT IN FORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content> The main source of local employment   
 within this block is farming but      
 farmers and farm labourers no longer  
 make up the bulk of the working       
 population.  15 villagers still find  
 employment within the village of      
 Forthampton but the majority of the   
 people now commute four miles to      
 Tewkesbury to work in factories and   
 offices.  There is one gentleman who  
 commutes daily to London and there is 
 also a Gloucester bank manager and a  
 judge who live in the village         
 Only two people are now employed at   
 Forthampton Court, the local manor    
 house, which uses contract labour in  
 place of a large permanent staff.     
 The block is becoming increasingly    
 dominated by retired people who have  
 either lived there all their lives or 
 have moved to enjoy the peace and     
 quiet of this rural area.             </content>
