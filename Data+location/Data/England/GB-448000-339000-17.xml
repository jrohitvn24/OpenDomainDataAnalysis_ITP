		<title>17Education of the deaf</title>
		<content> Attached to the William Sharp School  
 is a Hearing Impaired Unit.This unique
 educational establishment was set up  
 in 1972 when it was realised that the 
 Ewing School for the Deaf in          
 Nottingham could no longer provide for
 the educational and social needs of   
 its secondary aged pupils.It was      
 thought that a unit attached to a     
 normal comprehensive school could.At  
 the school all pupils both hearing    
 impaired and normal share break and   
 lunch time facilities,register        
 together and participate in craft and 
 P.E lessons.How many other lessons a  
 hearing impaired pupil will receive   
 with the hearing children depends on  
 that child's hearing loss and ability.
 Partially hearing children spend most 
 of their time in the main school with 
 back-up from teachers of the deaf.
