		<title>19Garden Centres</title>
		<content> There are several Garden Centres and  
 plant nurseries in our area. They open
 7 days a week to cater for increased  
 public demand. A particularly         
 successful one is Barnett Hill Garden 
 Centre owned by Mr and Mrs Wrighton.  
 They bought the 20 acre rough         
 hillside fields site in 1969, put up a
 hut and started the business. Today   
 the area is attractively landscaped   
 and well-labelled selling plants and  
 shrubs for particular places. There is
 also an aquatic centre stocking pools,
 fish and related products and also a  
 section selling building materials and
 garden furniture. A large covered     
 area offers everything from potted    
 plants to lawnmowers and weedkillers  
 to books and cards. Part of the site  
 is franchised to firms including a    
 craft centre, restaurant and stone    
 mason.                                </content>
