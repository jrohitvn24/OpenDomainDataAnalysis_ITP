		<title>08WATLING ESTATE,BURNT OAK.</title>
		<content>   The Watling Estate was built as one 
 of the largest council estates in the 
 country. The houses are 'cottage'     
 type, built in a variety of styles and
 materials, predominantly 'redbrick',  
 but with some timber-fronted and some 
 metal-plated. Many people have now    
 bought their homes from the council   
 and have made alterations to them.    
{Watling Market:}Burnt Oak's market is 
 an old established one, granted by    
 royal charter. In the early days of   
 the Estate the main shopping street,  
 Watling Avenue, was crammed with      
 market barrows. The majority are now  
 off-street, in Watling Market, behind 
 Watling Avenue. The future of Watling 
 market is uncertain. There is         
 speculation that, as part of a plan to
 develop Burnt Oak shopping centre, the
 council want to move the market       
 further away from Watling Avenue.     </content>
