		<title>07Home Farm And Charalais Herd</title>
		<content>      This 110 Strong Herd of pedigree 
 Charalais cattle are managed by Mr    
 Rugg, store manager for Mr and Mrs    
 Lyster. Charalais cows are white and  
 originate from France. The breed was  
 introduced into this country by       
 Colonel Lancaster in 1966.            
      In their first few weeks the bull
 calves have their horns removed and   
 rings put in their noses, so they can 
 be controlled easily. A bull can grow 
 to about one and a half tons. Their   
 biggest bull is called Thunder.       
      The cattle are shown regulary at 
 shows like the Royal &amp; the Highland.  
 They win many prizes. Preperation for 
 the shows takes six months. When a    
 show is near bulls are cleaned, washed
 shampooed and dried. One bull recently
 sold for Â£6500.                       
      These cows are special as they   
 have quick growing and lean meat.     </content>
