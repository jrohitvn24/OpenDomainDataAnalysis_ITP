		<content> The work for this block was completed 
 in,it's entirity,by nine to thirteen  
 year old pupils from:-                
 1.{Coppice Primary School,}Roper      
 Avenue, Heanor.                       
 2.{Heanor Mundy Street School,}Mundy  
 Street, Heanor.                       
 3.{Aldercar Comprehensive School,    }
 Daltons Close, Langley Mill.          
 All survey work, written text,        
 photographs and their descriptions    
 were produced by the pupils during the
 summer term of 1985. Difficulties     
 encountered included the shortage of  
 time resulting from poor organisation 
 on the BBC's behalf; the difficulty of
 transport, especially for the junior  
 schools;two schools originally        
 involved dropping out at the last     
 moment; and the compilation of the    
 finished project when information came
 from a number of sources.             </content>
