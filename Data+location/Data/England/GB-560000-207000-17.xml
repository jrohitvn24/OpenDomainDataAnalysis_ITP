		<content>      Christmas Day 25th December is   
 used to celebrate Christ's birth. Lots
 more people go to church than usual to
 celebrate and they give presents to   
 each other. One Christmas Day I woke  
 up and found my stocking full up with 
 lots of goodies. I had a tangerine, a 
 pocket game and several other things I
 told mum what I had got and went to   
 see what my Brothers Mark and Patrick 
 had got. I asked Dad whether I could  
 open my presents. He said that I could
 after dinner. So we went to church.   
 When we came home from church we had  
 dinner. During dinner we watched Jack 
 Tatty. After dinner we opened our     
 presents.My favourite present was a   
 clock radio and a game called Downfall
 At 9pm we watched Raiders of the Lost 
 Ark on television and after that we   
 watched a comedy called{Some{like it  
{Hot!}                                 </content>
