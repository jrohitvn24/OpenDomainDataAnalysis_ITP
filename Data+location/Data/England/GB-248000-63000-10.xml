		<title>10Bickham House (2).</title>
		<content>  There are 23 rooms in the house,     
 three less than originally. These     
 three having been replaced by two     
 additional staircases.The most recent 
 addition is a cottage converted from  
 the original outhouses. Although the  
 exterior of the house is of interest  
 the interior is not historically      
 important.                            
  The house used to have five servants 
 and a complete maintenance team       
 but now only one daily help is        
 employed together with a cook for two 
 days a week and two decorators.       
  The gardens are open to the public   
 every Sunday in April, May and early  
 June. Proceeds from the entrance fee  
 of 50p are donated to charity. Over   
 the last three years a lace exhibition
 has become an annual event. Parties   
 may also be held by special           
 appointment.                          </content>
