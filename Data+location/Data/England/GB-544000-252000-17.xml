		<title>17Summary of Great Shelford</title>
		<content>  Great Shelford is considered an up   
 market housing area. It is very       
 atractive with many trees and appears 
 to be a rather unspoilt English       
 village. Many of the older houses are 
 built in the typical Cambridge style, 
 i.e. yellowish coloured bricks and a  
 rather plain architectural style.     
  There are many small shops, but most 
 people with cars do their shopping in 
 Cambridge which is close by. Many     
 people also work in Cambridge and this
 role as a commuting village has grown 
 in recent years. There is a limited   
 train service to the village but most 
 people rely on private transport.     
  The village has a good community     
 spirit and thriving organisations such
 as the W.I.                           
  To the south-east Shelford joins the 
 village of Stapleford and it is now   
 difficult to separate the two.        </content>
