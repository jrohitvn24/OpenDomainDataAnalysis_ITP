		<content>    In common with many other areas of 
 the country, "Church-going" has       
 steadily declined in recent years.    
    At the Church of St.Philip and St. 
 James in Kimblesworth attendances vary
 between 30 and 40 each Sunday.        
    Due to lack of interest there is no
 longer a "Sunday School" at the local 
 chapel in Nettlesworth.               
    (Churches in Sacriston are outside 
 this "Block" with the exception of the
 Salvation Army Citadel.)              
    It seems a great pity because once 
 there were two chapels in Kimblesworth
 -their choirs entered Eistedfods-     
 one even won a cup .Sunday School     
 anniversaries were occasions when     
 everyone had new clothes to show off.
