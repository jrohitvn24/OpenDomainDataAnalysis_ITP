		<content>This service started in 1822 and came  
here in 1934 Our station is in one of  
the four Martello Towers which are     
still found in Felixstowe (the fifth , 
with the Dooley Fort was demolished    
when the dock expanded recently)       
These towers were built in 1810 as     
defence against Napoleon's French      
armies The Coastguard in Felixstowe is 
responsible for the safety of the      
coastline between the rivers   Deben   
and  Orwell. The main dangers here     
are the rapid weather changes and the  
prevailing winds. Most emergencies     
occur in the summer when there is much 
tourism although  fishermen need this  
service throughout the year.           
 The sea defences.  The Suffolk Coastal
District Council spend 20 to  30       
thousand pounds a year on sea defences.
The wall design is attractive          
but was not built with tourism in mind.</content>
