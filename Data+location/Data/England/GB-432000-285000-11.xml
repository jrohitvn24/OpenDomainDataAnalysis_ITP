		<title>11ATTITUDES IN BEDWORTH</title>
		<content> Within the "village" areas of our     
 block,there are many suggestions for  
 improving standards &amp; facilities,     
 although many residents appear        
 satisfied.People want to see greater  
 provision for the young &amp; old,        
 e.g. play facilities with supervision,
 youth clubs &amp; a community hall."It is 
 a village community without the       
 assets".People are also concerned with
 the attraction of the area.It should  
 be tidier,there should be more shrubs 
 &amp; trees &amp; people should be fined for  
 letting dogs loose.Other concerns     
 include the lack of local shops       
 (especially a chemist),poor pavements 
 &amp; the need for more adult evening     
 classes.The neighbourhood is greatly  
 concerned with the increase in crime, 
 more especially petty rule-breaking   
 such as motor cycles &amp; cars being     
 driven on local playing fields.       </content>
