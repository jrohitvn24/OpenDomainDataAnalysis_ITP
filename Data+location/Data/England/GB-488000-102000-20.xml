		<title>20LOCAL JOURNALS AND SLIDES</title>
		<content> There are in existence two volumes of 
 a journal and a series of lantern     
 slides illustrating village buildings,
 streets, people and events in Runcton,
 North Mundham and Hunston during the  
 first half of the 20th. Century, with 
 some reference to life before and     
 after this period.   The slides were  
 collected by the Rev'd E.P.A.C. Outram
 during the period 1919-1971, most of  
 the slides being made by him from     
 photographs he and his parishioners   
 had taken.   A special part of the    
 collection was made during the 1951   
 Festival of Britain Year, the vicar   
 being helped in this task by the      
 amateur photographers of the parish.  
 The documents and slides provide a    
 valuable insight to the social history
 of the area.
