		<title>10Garden machinery</title>
		<content> As our area is mainly grassland,and   
 houses have big gardens,garden        
 machinery is very important.In        
 Plaitford there is a garden machinery 
 business.  Some lawnmowers come with  
 grassboxes,some are big and some are  
 small.Some are mains electric,and some
 are petrol engines.Electric mowers are
 usually small,and have a flex and you 
 have to push them along.Electric      
 mowers are quite dangerous because you
 could runover the flex.The motors     
 quite often burn out if you use them  
 toolong.Electric mowers cost fifty    
 pounds too one hundred and fifty      
 pounds Self_Propelled petrol mowers   
 are very powerful.They have grass     
 boxes and some have blades under the  
 deck,and others have a rotating blade.
