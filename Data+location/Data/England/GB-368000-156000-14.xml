		<title>14My House</title>
		<content> My house has three bedrooms. Mine has 
 a slope in the corner. We have a very 
 big garden with two fruit trees, an   
 apple and plum. The back garden is 180
 ft. long.We used to have chickens but 
 a fox got into the pen and killed them
 all. we also have a greenhouse for    
 tomatoes. We have a large lounge and a
 sun lounge at the back which opens    
 onto the garden. Upstairs my bedroom  
 is the smallest. The one next door is 
 a spare room and the largest at the   
 back is where Mum and Dad sleeo. We   
 have an airing cupboard next to the   
 bathroom upstairs. In the kitchen we  
 have a Rayburn on which Mum bakes and 
 cooks our meals. Our house is built of
 stone with a tiled roof.
