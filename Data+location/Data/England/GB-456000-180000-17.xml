      In the whole area the oldest     
 house we saw is{Stuart}and it is      
 thatched with timber beams in the wall
 and small windows and has been        
 pebble-dashed.                        
                                       
      We noticed that most of the      
 houses in the High Street, Streatley  
 are{Georgian}with some modern houses  
 built in neo-Georgian style nearby.   
                                       
      The Georgian houses are large and
 square, usually with three storeys    
 attractive corner stones and sometimes
 pillars at the main entrance.         
                                       
      We also identified{Victorian}    
 houses by their fancy brick work, long
 sash windows,tall chimneys and large  
 gardens.Streatley also has traditional
{brick and flint}cottages.             </content>
