		<content>    The Domesday Survey records a      
{Horton Kirby Church}in 1086.  Parts of
 the present building date from c.1225.
  The nave was rebuilt early 14th      
 Century. The tower was rebuilt in     
 1816,the chancel and porch halved in  
 length in 1821. The result is a unique
 building. It displays trade skills and
 crafts over 700 years. However, it is 
 not a museum. It is the spiritual     
 centre of the community. Despite its  
 civil cares having been curtailed     
 legally, the Church permeates local   
 life from birth to death. In a parish 
 of approx. 3,000 pop. there are on    
 average 32 baptisms, 23 funerals and  
 10 weddings each year. There is a     
 Church School of 240 pupils. The      
 Church is alive and growing. It is    
 only through its work that ages to    
 come will hear the Gospel of Jesus    
 Christ, the Son of God.               </content>
