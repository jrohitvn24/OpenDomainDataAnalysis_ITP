		<content>{  Marbles}is a very popular game in   
 our school during summer. Any number  
 of people can play the game of        
 marbles. We play the Pakistani rules. 
 The game's rules are as follows:      
{ (1) You use a hole in the ground.    
  (2) One of the players shakes the    
 marbles and drops them on the ground. 
{ (3) The players have different       
{coloured marbles.                     
  (4) The player who is furthest from  
 the hole gets the first go.           
{ (5) The other player then aims at the
{hole.}                                
      (Sometimes they miss the hole.   
 Sometimes they don't aim directly at  
 the hole because they decide to take  
 more than one shot.)                  
                                       
      THE PERSON WHO WINS THE GAME     
 GETS ANOTHER MARBLE.
