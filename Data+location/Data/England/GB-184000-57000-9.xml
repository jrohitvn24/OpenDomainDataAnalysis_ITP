		<content>  On Wednesday, the 17th and Thursday  
 18th of July 1985 class 3J went to    
 Trerice Manor. During these two days  
 four children questioned an average of
 twenty-one people a day. On Wednesday 
 twenty-five people were interviewed,  
 on Thursday seventeen people were     
 interviewed. They found out that all  
 the people enjoyed their visit. There 
 was only one person who came from     
 Newquay and there were only three     
 people who came from within the county
 of Cornwall. Three-quarters of the    
 people were National Trust members.   
 All the people said that the house was
 *LOVELY*, and that the food in the    
 restaurant-particularly the           
 *CREAM-TEAS* were delicious.
