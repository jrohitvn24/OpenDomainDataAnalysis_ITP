		<title>09St.Johns Church Wetley Rocks</title>
		<content>The church was built in 1834 and has   
always played a very large part in     
community life. It is very well        
attended by all ages and has close     
links with St.John's Primary School.   
During the year there are many         
important services including the Palm  
Sunday Cross Bearing service. Three    
crosses are carried from Withy Stakes  
through the avenues into Wetley Rocks. 
The crosses are then erected upon the  
rocks and an open air service is       
conducted below.                       
Christmas Eve mass is also a popular   
service as is the Harvest Festival     
where gifts are brought into church and
later distributed to the elderly. The  
church also holds functions such as the
summer garden party at the Black &amp;     
White House in Consall and the         
Christmas Bazaar which enhances the    
close links  with the community.       </content>
