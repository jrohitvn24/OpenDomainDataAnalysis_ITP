		<title>08The Methodist Chapel</title>
		<content>  The Chapel was built in 1901. Before 
that there used to be a meeting place  
where Walker's shop is now. There are  
services every Sunday at 11am and at   
6.30pm. 250 people belong to the       
Methodist Chapel and about 100 are     
confirmed members. About 64 adults and 
38 children attend the morning services
on Sundays.                            
  The organisations which use the      
chapel are Bible Study, Women's        
meetings, prayer meetings , Coton Play 
Group, Mothers and Toddlers, Hobbies   
and Drama clubs. There are also special
services and the chapel is used as a   
clinic once a month.                   
  To help people in the community,     
apart from the orgaisations, there are 
visits to the sick, help for the old   
and flowers are given.
