		<title>12THE M1 AND SPEED</title>
		<content>We had a member of the Traffic Police  
come along to school to talk about the 
problems caused by the work on the M1. 
The numbers of speeders on the         
Northants stretch of the M1 (28 miles),
April 84 - March 85 were: 1026         
prosecuted, 1016 stopped and advised,  
780 cautioning letters sent; most      
speeders were over 26. In a separate   
check it was found that the majority of
speeders were in company cars. The     
fastest chase on the M1 was from       
Watford Gap to Dunstable in 15 minutes 
{42 miles - 160+ mph}. The most feeble 
excuse for speeding was "My wife is    
pregnant &amp; I'm taking her to hospital":
the man was travelling from London to  
Leeds at the time - {193 miles}. We    
thought that on a {proper road surface,
with the right driver}, 80-90 mph was a
safe speed. 43% of accidents were      
caused by roadworks &amp; contra-flows.    </content>
