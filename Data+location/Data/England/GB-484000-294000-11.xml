		<title>11Eyebrook Reservoir</title>
		<content> This reservoir,fed by the Eye Brook   
 which rises to the North West,        
 was constructed between 1936 and 1940 
 It was used by the steelworks in Corby
 which required 8 million gallons per  
 day.Today only 1.6million is needed   
 with the recent demise of the works.On
 average 670.5mm of precipitation falls
 over the catchment area annually.The  
 average water depth in the reservoir  
 is 5.3m,rising to 12.8m at the dam.The
 dam,constructed of concrete blocks and
 clay is 517m long,90m broad at the    
 base and 4.6m at the top.At times     
 waves up to 4m high pound against the 
 wall.Siphons drain the water from the 
 reservoir when the level rises above  
 maximum. Normally the water flows to  
 the pumping station at Caldecott to be
 pumped to Rockingham then Corby.
