		<title>20ROUNDUP &amp; CREDITS, ST.ALLEN</title>
		<content> It has been a pleasure to visit farms 
 &amp; homes in St.Allen area, &amp; to hear   
 Cornish farmers talk with enthusiasm  
 about their land.They are hard-working
 positively forward-looking, determined
 to make full use of modern technology 
 &amp; to continue to make a living for    
 themselves &amp; their children.  They are
 concerned for the well-being of their 
 animals,keen to keep high standards in
 maintenance of land,hedges,&amp;buildings.
 They appreciate good quality of farm  
 life &amp; variety of jobs with changing  
 seasons through the year. They foresee
 a tougher future when only efficient  
 farmers will survive. No-one seemed to
 know of the Domesday Project, but all 
 were interested &amp; very helpful.
