		<content>    Our school (a country school) has  
 about 150 children, from four to      
 eleven. Our school is small for the   
 amount of children. The children wear 
 green tops and grey trousers or skirts
 and sometimes in the summer girls wear
 green and white checked dresses. We   
 have each planted a tree, for we have 
 a rough area full of wild plants. We  
 have a fairly big playing field, and  
 an infant and junior playground each. 
 We don't have desks, we have trays    
 where we keep our books. Our          
 classrooms have too many children     
 really. Our headmaster is a teacher as
 well as a headmaster. We often have   
 students to help to teach us. Each    
 year we have a Christmas play. From   
 our classroom windows, most of us can 
 see lots of fields and countryside.
