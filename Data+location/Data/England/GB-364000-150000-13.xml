		<content> Most families have a car of their own 
 but some people, especially older     
 people, have to use the buses, or     
 walk.                                 
 The bus company, Badgerline, runs     
 buses from Stratton to Midsomer       
 Norton, Radstock,   Bath, Frome and   
 Shepton Mallet.  From Chilcompton     
 buses go to Midsomer Norton, Radstock,
 Bath and Wells. The buses run about   
 every hour from 0700 to 2000. There   
 are very few buses after 2000.        
 Most of the buses are single deckers  
 but some are double deckers with seats
 upstairs as well.                     
 It is quite expensive on the bus;it   
 costs 50p to go two miles. When you   
 get on the bus you have to pay the    
 driver who gives you a ticket.
