		<title>13Bent Ley Farm</title>
		<content> Bent Ley Farm is at Meltham Mills and 
 covers 200 acres. It is owned by the  
 Haigh family. They have 150 Friesian  
 cows of which 60 were giving milk     
 when we visited the farm. The cows    
 give a total of 220 gallons of milk a 
 day which is sent to Dickinsons       
 Creamery to be made into yoghurt. Mr. 
 Haigh does not have a milk round. The 
 fields are used to grow grass which is
 turned into silage.                   
   Mr. Haigh breeds pigs which he kills
 himself to provide pork for a number  
 of butchers' shops that are owned by  
 other members of his family. He also  
 keeps a few sheep, lambs and poultry  
 to supply the shops. Mr. Haigh has 10 
 people to help him on his farm and has
 been a farmer for 32 years.
