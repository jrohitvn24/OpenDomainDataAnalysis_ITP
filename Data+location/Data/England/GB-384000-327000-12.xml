		<title>12SHALLOWFORD : WALTON MUSEUM</title>
		<content> The museum at Shallowford is a cottage
 bequeathed by the angler Izaak Walton 
 to his native Stafford in 1683.  The  
 museum's aim is to show a domestic    
 interior such as Walton would have    
 known.  It is a timber-framed building
 with a tiled roof.  The original      
 thatched roof was destroyed by a      
 fire started by a spark from a passing
 steam train in 1939.                  
 The museum houses stuffed fish of     
 record sizes.  Souvenirs connected    
 with Izaak Walton and his book 'The   
 Compleat Angler' are on sale.         
 In 1983 the cottage featured on a     
 special envelope commissioned by      
 Staffordshire County Council for a    
 series of Post Office stamps depicting
 British river fishes.
