		<content> The rural catchment area consists of  
 the villages of Cotherstone,          
 Romaldkirk and Lartington, with the   
 hamlet of Hunderthwaite and           
 Baldersdale, which is an area of      
 scattered farms.  74% of the children 
 travel to school by transpot which is 
 provided by the Durham Local Education
 Authority.  Mid-day meals are cooked  
 at the school at a charge of 60p      
 daily.  The school kitchen also       
 provides 14 meals for the elderly,    
 twice weekly, which are delivered by  
 the Women's Voluntary Service.        
                                       
 At the age of 11 years most pupils    
 transfer to Teesdale Comprehensive    
 School which is 6 miles away in       
 Barnard Castle, but usually 1 or 2    
 boys transfer to Barnard Castle       
 school, which is a Boy's Public       
 School.                               </content>
