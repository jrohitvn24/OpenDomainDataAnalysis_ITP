		<title>05AMERSHAM'S HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Amersham appears in the 1086 Domesday
 book as Agmondesham. Prehistoric in-  
 habitants were nomadic and no remains 
 of hut circles have been found here as
 in other Chiltern districts, though a 
 looped Bronze age spearhead was found 
 in the river Misbourne in 1956.       
 A prehistoric trade route passed over 
 Gore Hill and is marked by pudding    
 stones. Gore Hill is reputedly the    
 site of a bloody battle between Danes 
 and Saxons.A Roman farming settlement 
 was demolished when the Aylesbury Road
 was excavated between Coldmoreham farm
 and Shardeloes. During the Civil War  
 many Royalist and Puritan troops      
 marched through the town and          
 Cromwell dined at the Griffin Hotel   
 in the High Street..                  
 Amersham was a staging-post for       
 coaches, and you can still see many of
 the arches for the coaches.           </content>
