		<title>15SOUTHALL HORSE MARKET</title>
		<content>    There has been a horse market in   
 Southall since about 1698 and it is   
 still held every Wednesday afternoon. 
 The auction starts with the sale of   
 tack and carriages. After that the    
 horses are sold. Some 100 horses are  
 sold every week. They are run up and  
 down in front of the buyers to show   
 off their paces. Most of the horses   
 are well groomed with their manes and 
 tails plaited. Then the auctioneer    
 starts the bidding. Prices vary       
 depending on whether the horse is     
 going for horsemeat, when they fetch  
 low prices or for future use as show  
 or carriage horses. Buyers of carriage
 horses are allowed a few days to try  
 out the horse. Sometimes horses are   
 sold again after the auction, when the
 sign of acceptance of the deal is a   
 handslap.                             
                                       </content>
