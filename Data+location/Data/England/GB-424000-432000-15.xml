		<title>15ALEX (AGED 9)AND HIS FAMILY</title>
		<content> After breakfast I had to practise on  
 our piano in preparation for my Grade 
 One exam. next week. I have one lesson
 per week at my teacher's house. My    
 sister, aged 13, plays the oboe, and  
 on Saturday mornings she goes into    
 Leeds to  practise. She has a morning 
 paper round to deliver before she     
 goes. My dad always works on Saturday 
 mornings. He manages a clothing       
 factory in Bradford. On this Saturday 
 we were given 4 more goldfish for our 
 garden pond. In the front garden my   
 dad keeps his micro-lite which he uses
 most weekends. This week we all went  
 to the local Carnival where there were
 processions and entertainments. Later 
 in the afternoon I had a mock piano   
 exam. at my teacher's house. After tea
 we watched television.
