		<content>  With few men employed on the land the
 village is gradually becoming more of 
 a tourist area than a traditional     
 farming one. Property was relatively  
 cheap and with the advent of          
 electricity and piped water, cottages 
 become appealing as a second home     
 or holiday cottages to be let. This   
 has led to an influx of new residents,
 many retired people have made thier   
 homes here. City dwellers come for    
 weekends and holidays. Some houses are
 commercially let.This means that the  
 village is changing rapidly.It is now 
 tidier and houses are better          
 maintained but shops have closed for  
 lack of weekday and winter trade,     
 Public Houses have also gone and the  
 School is threatened.
