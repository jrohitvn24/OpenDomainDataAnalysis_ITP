 We asked people what they thought     
 about most or worried about.          
 Some people were worried about the    
 starving people in Africa and the huge
 amounts of food in Europe.They thought
 it was wrong for one part of the world
 to have too much food whilst other    
 people were dying. Some people        
 mentioned the high rate of            
 unemployment in this country and      
 worried that their children might not 
 be able to get jobs.                  
 Some people were keen conservationists
 and wanted to keep the country and the
 world free from pollution.            
 We think that the people in this part 
 of the country are very much the same 
 as anywhere else in this respect.     
 This is probably because we all see   
 the same programmes and read the same 
 newspapers.                           </content>
