 out of sandstone and has figures      
 around the middle of it who are       
 dressed in service uniforms.There is a
 lantern on top of it.There is a plaque
 on the side of the monument dedicated 
 to the 266 people of Alnwick who gave 
 their lives in the two world          
 wars.These people have their names    
 inscribed on the monument.Every       
 Remembrance Sunday this memorial is   
 the centre of the service of          
 remembrance as civic leaders lay their
 wreaths and pay their respects to the 
 dead.                                 </content>
