		<content> The most notable building in our      
 survey area is{Wingfield Manor.} There
 has been a house on this site since   
 Norman times although the present     
 building is sixteenth century.  It is 
 partly in ruins.  The tower with a    
 circular stone staircase provides     
 clear views over the countryside.  The
 Manor was partly destroyed in the     
 Civil War.  It is famous because it   
 was owned by Bess of Hardwick         
 (Countess of Shrewsbury) and used to  
 imprison Mary, Queen of Scots.  It was
 the focal point of the so_called      
 "Babbington Plot".                    
                                       
 The village church of South Wingfield 
 "All Saints", is also of Norman origin
 and has a square bell tower.
