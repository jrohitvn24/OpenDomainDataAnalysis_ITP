		<title>11ARCHITECTURE IN SUDBOROUGH</title>
		<content>   In Sudborough the houses are all    
 fairly old except for a few which     
 were built in the late sixties and    
 early seventies.                      
   There are several thatched cottages 
 in Sudborough. There are also some    
 terraced houses, all in the same      
 style,one containing a pub. These     
 houses are made of a pale stone and   
 brick, which makes Sudborough a nice  
 village of pleasant houses. Since the 
 by-pass was opened on the A6116 a     
 few years ago, Sudborough has become  
 extremely quiet - the residents mostly
 hope that it will remain this way!
