		<content> Hazlegrove House School:              
           Hazlegrove has about two    
 hundred and fifty boys, and it is     
 expanding all the time. It is a boy's 
 school only, for ages of 8 to 13, with
 the choices of being a day-boy or     
 boarder.                              
           Hazlegrove has a high       
 standard of education teaching 8      
 main subjects.Boys leaving the school 
 take scholarship or Common Entrance   
 exams and there is a high pass rate.  
           At Hazlegrove, buildings are
 being added every so often: a new Art 
 and Craft centre has just been        
 finished and there are plans for more 
 classrooms and dormitories.           
           At the moment Hazlegrove has
 only about two hundred and fifty boys,
 although there are plans to double    
 this number in the next few years.
