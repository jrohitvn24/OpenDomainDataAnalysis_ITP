		<title>04DUNKERTON WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> There is a considerable variety of    
 wildlife in the area. Of the larger   
 mammals foxes, badgers and grey       
 squirrels are common and deer are     
 found away from the village. There are
 also a lot of bats. Of the birds, Barn
 owls and little owls are notable and  
 herons will come very close to houses,
 even to take fish from a pool right   
 next to Church House Dunkerton. In    
 recent years mink have colonised the  
 Cam brook with the result that trout, 
 which were once plentiful are no      
 longer found.                         
  The local tree population has been   
 hit hard by the destruction of the    
 elms by Dutch elm disease, and the    
 villagers of Dunkerton have planted   
 about 500 trees of various kinds of   
 native hardwood to replace lost trees 
                                       
                                       </content>
