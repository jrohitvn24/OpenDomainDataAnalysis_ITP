		<content>The area benefits greatly from the     
modifying influence of the sea and the 
ser of frosts helps in growing barley  
and kale for seed. It is however       
exposed to all winds from a northerly  
direction.                             
High pressure located over the British 
Isles brings problems in both summer   
and winter. During summer sunshine     
winds come off the the cool North Sea  
often bringing a cold mist;known       
locally as a 'fret', onto the crowded  
sandy beaches. In winter the winds are 
drawn from Europe across the           
comparatively warm North Sea bringing  
heavy falls of snow or are bitingly    
cold. Low rainfall amounts- and-       
sunshine hours excess of 4 hours daily 
on average are two factors extremely   
important to both the tourist and      
agricultural industries.
