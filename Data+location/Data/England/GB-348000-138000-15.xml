		<content> Mummy and I leave home at 8.30a.m.and 
 walk half a mile to school. The bell  
 rings at 8.50a.m. and then we all go  
 into school. There are eight classes  
 and we have about thirty children in  
 each class.  During the morning I do  
 some writing, draw pictures, read and 
 do number work. I like to use the     
 computer. In the playground we have   
 lots of apparatus to climb and swing  
 on.  When it is fine and the grass is 
 dry we can play on the paddock.  From 
 April to October we have swimming     
 lessons in our own indoor pool.       
 In the afternoons we can choose what  
 we do. I like painting and making junk
 models, or using the construction     
 toys.  Sometimes I dress up and play  
 in the Wendy House.                   
  Our school is called St. John's, and 
 the junior school is St. Benedict's.  
 The big children go to St. Dunstan's. </content>
