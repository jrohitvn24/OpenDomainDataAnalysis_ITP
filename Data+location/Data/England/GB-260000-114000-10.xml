 Boys.When we are out playing we play a
       game of army and we pick teams  
       and some of us get killed and   
       taken prisoner.People die for 20
       seconds.We attack all the time. 
 Girls.At playtime I play swinging with
       Faye. Her skipping rhyme is:    
  "Strawberry Shortcake dressed in blue
   Count how many skips I do.......... 
   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10."              
{CO-OPERATION WITH SMALL SCHOOLS.      
 For the past 3 years we have worked   
 closely with{King's Nympton School,}so
 that children work &amp; play in a larger 
 peer group about once a fortnight.From
 1984{East Worlington School}has joined
 the scheme.We travel to another school
 by coach each term in rotation for    
{joint activities}-games,drama,science 
 and music as the teachers devise.
