		<title>09Local food-Oatcakes</title>
		<content>     Oatcakes originated in North      
Staffordshire at the beginning of the  
nineteenth century.They remain popular 
to the present day.                    
     Oatcakes are made from oats,flour 
and water and they are cooked on a     
flat,hot iron griddle.To this very day 
the recipe for Oatcakes remains a      
closely guarded secret.There are few if
any shops outside North Staffordshire  
which sell Oatcakes.                   
     Oatcakes are usually eaten with   
fried bacon,grilled cheese and         
tomatoes.They can also be eaten hot    
with just butter.They remain           
essentially a breakfast meal but a     
number of people like to have Oatcakes 
for their evening meal.
