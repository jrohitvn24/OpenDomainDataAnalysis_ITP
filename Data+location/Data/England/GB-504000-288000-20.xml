		<title>20ASHTON MILL 2</title>
		<content>     The watermill on the River Nene   
 was converted in 19OO to provide      
 piped water for the village from a    
 10,000 gallon tank at the end of the  
 mill. Electricity was also generated. 
 This engineering work was done by     
 William Morris Thomas, an employee of 
 the Lord Rothschild who then owned the
 estate. His daughter, the             
 Hon.Mrs.Lane, is the present owner.   
 The engines for the mill were also    
 made locally by Blackstones of        
 Stamford. The firm still exists in    
 1985, although like many others it    
 seems to be going through hard times. 
 The mill itself is now preserved as a 
 fish museum and open to the public at 
 weekends.
