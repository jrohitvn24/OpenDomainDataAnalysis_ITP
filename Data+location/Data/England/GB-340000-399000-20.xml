		<content> Most young people in Kirkby try to    
 keep up with the fashion. At the      
 moment it is trendy to wear sporting  
 types of clothes. This causes trouble 
 in school, especially for the boys,   
 because training shoes are not allowed
 and a lot of boys like to wear them.  
 Some girls like to wear high heeled   
 shoes but this is also not allowed in 
 school because they are dangerous,    
 especially walking up and down stairs.
 Wearing jewellery also causes problems
 because it is expensive and might get 
 stolen. In fact, trying to keep up    
 with fashion costs money and is one of
 the reasons why some pupils get       
 Saturday jobs. Without this extra     
 money they couldn't afford to buy new 
 "gear".
