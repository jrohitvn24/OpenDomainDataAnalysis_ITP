		<content> Among the games we play are:          
   "Bulldog"                           
    The "catcher" stands in the middle 
 of the playground while eveyone else  
 stands against the end wall. The      
 catcher chooses one person who has to 
 cross the yard without being caught.  
 If caught this person joins the       
 catcher. If not caught, everyone else 
 then crosses the yard, but anyone     
 caught joins the catcher. The game    
 continues until only one person has   
 not been caught.                      
   "Chain Tig"                         
   One person is "it", and has to touch
 another person who also becomes "it". 
 Each person caught joins hands with   
 the catchers until a large chain is   
 formed. The winner is the last person 
 to be caught.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
