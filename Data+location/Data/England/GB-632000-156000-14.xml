		<title>14Interview with a housewife.</title>
		<content>I interviewed my mum.I asked her"Do you
do your shopping in Sandwich?".She     
answered"I do a little bit of shopping 
during the week in Sandwich but I do   
the main shopping in Deal,in Keymarkets
which is a supermarket".               
She shops daily for bits and pieces but
she does the main shopping weekly.She  
shere she does because you can buy     
larger variety and it is sometimes     
cheaper.Sandwich as a shopping centre  
she thinks is poor.                    
When I asked"Does Sandwich provide     
enough interest for young people in the
evening?"she said"No".In her spare     
time she reads,knits,does gardening and
relaxes.When I asked"Can you tell me a 
bit more about the things you enjoy?"  
she replied"I enjoy gardening and I    
like to see the garden looking nice and
I like to pick my own vegetables.I also
enjoy knitting for the family".        </content>
