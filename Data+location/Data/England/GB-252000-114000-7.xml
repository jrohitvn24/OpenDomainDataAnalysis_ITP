		<title>07BEAFORD SCHOOL SPORTS DAY</title>
		<content>   On Wednesday 19th. June it was our  
 sports day. The first event was the   
 80m sprint which Lorelie won.  Every  
 sports day we do an obstacle race.    
 This year we had to match cards; crawl
 under a net; undo a knotted skipping  
 rope; score a goal at the netball     
 post; roll a ball 20m using a shinty  
 stick; then finish off carrying an egg
 in a spoon. I was third in this race. 
   It was a nice afternoon, not too    
 hot, just right. Another of my events 
 was the relay race.  There were four  
 children in each team, and our team   
 won. Other races were skipping, sack, 
 bean bag, egg and spoon, and          
 mini-marathon races. Every child took 
 part in at least 2 events.            
   I did 5 events, although I had a    
 cold and cough so that held me back a 
 bit. In a fortnight 5 other schools   
 join us in the Area Schools Sports.   </content>
