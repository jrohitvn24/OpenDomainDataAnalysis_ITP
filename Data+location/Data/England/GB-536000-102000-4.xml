 The fact that Rottingdean and Saltdean
 are relatively affulent suburbs is    
 reflected in the large number of banks
 and building societies. Building      
 Societies are also heavily            
 represented. Both villages have       
 numerous local and national estate    
 agents. Building Society              
 representation is limited to an agency
 basis in Saltdean reflecting its lower
 level of commercial activity and      
 income of its population in comparison
 with Rottingdean with its large       
 retired population.Houses in          
 Rottingdean are generally older with  
 nothing selling for less than Â£50,ooo 
 and many more for well over Â£100,000. 
 Rottingdean is an urban village,      
 Saltdean a sprawling suburb.          </content>
