		<title>05Bowling in Clayton Park</title>
		<content> Every Wednesday afternoon I go bowling
 with other boys and girls at{Clayton  
{Park}with my primary school, St.      
 Brigid's. The veterans at the{bowling 
 club asked our Headmaster to let a    
 class go from our school. They        
 explained that there was a lot of     
{vandalism}in the area and that the    
 bowling green had been damaged several
 times. They thought that it would be a
 good idea if some children learned how
 to play bowls so that they might      
 respect the green. Everybody in our   
 class makes sure that the children    
 around our area know not to spoil the 
 green. The men coach us and if it     
 rains they organise snooker or singing
 contests. They also tell us about the 
 history of Clayton Park. The Bowls    
 Club is 40 years old and the club room
 was in Clayton Hall. Later a club room
 was built near the green.             </content>
