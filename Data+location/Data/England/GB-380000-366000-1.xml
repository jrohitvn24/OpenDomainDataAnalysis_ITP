 Our study area has taken us to a part 
 of Cheshire , where old world charm   
 has survived the profitable inroads of
 industry and is regarded by many as a 
 jewel in Cheshire's crown.            
 Swettenham village has gained regional
 fame for its  Daffodil Dell to which  
 many visitors trek in the Spring to   
 enjoy the blaze of floral colours.    
 A fairy tale atmosphere is heightened 
 by the presence of an ancient mill    
 where there is a wishing well and     
 items of wood craft for sale.         
 Through our survey , it was clear to  
 see that Swettenham is very much a    
 farming parish whose lanes lead to a  
 quaint old church , an old inn and the
 mill.
