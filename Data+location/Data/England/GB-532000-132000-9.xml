		<title>09SELSFIELD COMMON I</title>
		<content> This is one of the highest points in  
 the area, about 190m, and was an old  
{beacon}site. The Common was enclosed  
 in the 19th century but in{1912}seven 
 acres were conveyed to the{National   
{Trust}by{Lord Arthur Hill}of the Old  
 House, West Hoathly, and since 1914 it
 has been administered by{West Hoathly 
{Parish Council.}It is crossed by the  
 course of an old{Roman Road}and also  
 by a{smugglers' track.}Until early    
 this century there was a{windmill}and 
 the 18th century mill house and older 
 tile-hung mill cottages are still     
 there.{Old Selsfield}is a timber      
 framed house of the 17th century with 
 a barn of similar date. The common is 
 lightly wooded with deciduous trees   
 and there are patches of{bilberries.  
 The{warden}is responsible "...for the 
 provision of glades and for mowing the
 grass."                               </content>
