		<title>01A Rural Landscape</title>
		<content> This block is predominantly rural,    
 with a number of farms scattered over 
 the whole area, utilizing the land in 
 both pasture and arable farming.   The
 Shropshire Union Canal runs through   
 the southern area of the block and    
 there is also a reservoir which serves
 the area.   The block covers the area 
 of Cheswardine which is a small       
 village with a very limited number of 
 amenities and services for the local  
 inhabitants.   Dances, Bingo and      
 concerts are held in Cheswardine Hall 
 for the local people.   Two public    
 houses also serve the community, there
 are a couple of food shops but the    
 nearest town, Market Drayton, provides
 a more varied selection of shops and  
 services to the community.   Within   
 the block there are other             
 concentrations of buildings which make
 up small communities such as Soudley &amp;</content>
