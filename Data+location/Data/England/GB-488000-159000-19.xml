		<title>19CAMBERLEY POLICE cont.</title>
		<content> Between 8-9.30am &amp; 4-5.30pm police are
 busiest directing traffic on the A30  
 where most accidents occur. Speeding  
 is the most common driving offence.   
 Frequent royal visits require police  
 help from other areas.                
 During the recent miners' strike      
 Camberley police were drafted all over
 the country from Kent to Yorkshire.   
 They often earned overtime of Â£250 per
 week.Salaries vary from Â£6,708 for a  
 new PC to Â£13,944 for an Inspector.   
 Ken Clarke,one of our local 'bobbies',
 has written a book about Camberley    
 before the 1st.World War.He gives     
 lectures to many different            
 organisations - it helps with         
 "community policing".Our school       
 'contact'officer is WPC Robinson.The  
 police have changed their previous    
 policy of mechanical efficiency. Law  
 and order is the government theme.    </content>
