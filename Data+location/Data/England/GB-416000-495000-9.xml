		<title>09A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> On a Sunday we usually go out for the 
 day.This last Sunday we went to       
 Newcastle because it was my cousin's  
 birthday.We got up at 9am and had our 
 breakfast of toast and tea or coffee. 
 Our journey started about 10am and    
 when we got to Newcastle we went to   
 the {Quayside Market.}A new dress and 
 shoes were bought for me.After that it
 was about 12:45 so we went to my      
 Aunt's house and she had lunch ready  
 for us.For lunch we had chicken,      
 carrots,roast potatoes and gravy and  
 for pudding we had strawberry flan    
 with ice cream.When we had finished   
 our lunch my cousin and I went out to 
 play.We went to the park to play on   
 the swings and slide.Returning to my  
 Aunt's house we had a little tea party
 and there was all sorts of food to    
 eat.After tea we listened to Top of   
 the Pops till 7pm then we went home.  </content>
