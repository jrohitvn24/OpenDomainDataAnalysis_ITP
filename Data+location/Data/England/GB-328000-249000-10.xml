		<content> Our school is called{Eardisley C.of E.
{school}.It has about 98 children in it
 whose ages range from 5-11.Our school 
 is in the village but very close to   
 the countryside.Children come from    
 Eardisley,Willersley,Winforton and    
 Witney so many of them have to travel 
 on a minibus or come by car.We have 4 
 classrooms and 4{teachers}including   
 the{headmaster}The school was built in
 1857 although 10 years ago a new hall 
 and 2 new classrooms were built so it 
 is quite modern really.Every summer we
 have a fete and sports day to help    
 raise money for the school fund.At    
 school we do Maths.,English,P.E.,Art, 
 Television,Craft,Nature,Spellings and 
 once a week we travel 15 miles to     
 Leominster to go to the swimming pool.
 Sometimes we have a fire practice.It  
 is quite a big school for a country   
 school.We have a big field.           </content>
