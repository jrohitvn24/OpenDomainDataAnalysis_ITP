		<title>05Mr Breed's Nature Trail</title>
		<content>{Mr John Breeds}is the warden of{      
{Braunton Burrows}Nature Area. His job 
 is to look after the wildlife and keep
 an eye on the Burrows to make sure it 
 is being well protected. He came to   
 our school in a landrover to help     
 transport us to the car park to start 
 the nature trail.                     
  Throughout the walk he told us of the
 hundreds of things there is to see on 
 the Burrows. The first thing that     
 struck us was the large amount of     
 blue, tall plants called{Vipers       
{Bugloss.}We followed a path through   
 the scrub noticing caterpillars       
 (lackey Moths), wild orchids, moss and
 brambles.                             
  One of the children{(Susie           
{Nightingale),}nearly jumped out of her
 skin when she almost stepped on a     
 large green frog.
