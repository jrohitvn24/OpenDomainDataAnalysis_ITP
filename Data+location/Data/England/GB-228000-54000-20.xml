		<title>20RESIDENT'S ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content> The majority of this report has been  
 compiled by committee members of the  
 Resident's Association (CHN.W.HOCKING)
 This group was initially formed as the
 boatowners group which unsuccessfully 
 apposed the construction of a gabion  
 sea wall in 1970.Later evolution of   
 this pressure group saw it apposing   
 extensive and intensive private and   
 holiday development while encouraging 
 the provision of local amenity.       
 Membership includes individuals from  
 most of the other societies in the    
 villages,so it is able to act as a    
 rallying point in any crisis.Presently
 the Association is liasing with the   
 planning authority in order to produce
 a rationale for the future development
 of the village centre in Downderrry.  
 Should a new parish structure develop,
 the Association may have engineered   
 its own demise. R.J.DANIEL (Hon.Sec.) </content>
