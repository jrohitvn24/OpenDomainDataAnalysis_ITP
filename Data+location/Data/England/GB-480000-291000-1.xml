		<title>01Introduction-Medbourne Area.</title>
		<content> This block is a mainly rural          
 district lying along and adjacent to  
 part of the Welland Valley on the     
 border of S.E. Leicestershire and     
 Northamptonshire.  In recent years    
 the countryside has changed from      
 being predominately pastureland to a  
 mixed farming area.  Each year more   
 and more fields fall under the        
 plough.  The three communities        
 included are Medbourne (pop.560),     
 Drayton (pop.145) and Nevill Holt     
 (pop.40). Most residents commute to   
 work by car as the bus service is very
 sparse.  The main road is the B664    
 from Market Harborough to Uppingham   
 with minor roads joining the          
 villages.As houses and travel become  
 more expensive the average age of the 
 communities increases because young   
 married people cannot afford to stay.
