		<content>This factory is sited next to the      
P.P.F. factory. About a thousand people
work there. One mother who was         
interviewed packs soup and Vesta meals.
Dried powder is sealed in a plastic bag
and then into a card container. The    
workers wear special uniforms, strong  
shoes and an overall with a cap.       
Hygiene and cleanliness is very        
important when dealing with these and  
any food product. The mother works 5 or
6 days a week. The factory works in    
three shifts throughout the day and    
night. Most people travel to work by   
car. There is a medical service in case
of injury and a canteen for            
refreshments. There are two 15 minute  
tea breaks and one 30 minute dinner    
break.
