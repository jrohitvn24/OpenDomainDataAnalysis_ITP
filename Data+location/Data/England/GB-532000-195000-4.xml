		<title>04Typical School Day 1985</title>
		<content> Today is Tuesday. Mrs. Goddard calls  
 the register, people pay 70p a day for
 dinner. Today there is no Assembly so 
 we read for 30 minutes. Maths is      
 usually the next lesson, the 4th years
 use Alpha 4. We work for 30 minutes,  
 then we have playtime. We usually play
 Leapfrog. Play ends at 10.50. We then 
 have science, we take down notes and  
 draw pictures. We have lunch at noon. 
 I usually have crisps, sandwiches,    
 yogurt and a drink. We then play      
 Block. We go in at 1.15. Today we go  
 swimming. We have a 30 minute lesson. 
 We return to school at 2.30. At       
 playtime I have a flute lesson. I     
 practice scales and pieces for my     
 exam. I return to class at 3.10 where 
 Mr. Croft, the Curate is teaching R.I.
 Home time is at 3.40.
