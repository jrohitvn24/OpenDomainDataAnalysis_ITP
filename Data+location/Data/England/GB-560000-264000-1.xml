 At the centre of our area is the      
village of Exning,which lies two miles 
north west of Newmarket.There is now   
very little open space between         
Newmarket and Exning.                  
 The village has a small rivulet       
running through the centre,which starts
as the springs south-west of the       
village.The work around this area is   
mainly farming,light industries and    
stud work.Studlands Park and Scaltback 
are new housing estates in the area.   
Part of Studlands Park was built for   
Americans from the local air force base
at Mildenhall.The area contains 5      
schools, 2 Primary schools,2 Middle    
schools and an Upper school. The       
Newmarket by-pass,A45 cuts across the  
area.
