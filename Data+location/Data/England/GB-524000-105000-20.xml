		<content>  The 3 main crops grown are wheat,    
 barley and grass,cattle or sheep are  
 reared.Crop rotation is either 4 or 9 
 years of cereal followed by grass or  
 kale.The machinery on the farm is very
 important and includes tractors,      
 combine harvesters,crop sprayers and  
 ploughs.                              
  At the time of sowing crops are      
 fertilised with a compound fertiliser 
 consisting of nitrogen,phosphate and  
 potash.Straight nitrogen is also      
 applied but only in spring.There is   
 slight soil erosion and some trouble  
 associated with being on the edge of a
 town,such as gypsies and dumping of   
 rubbish.The type of farming is usually
 decided by economic factors.          
  Crops are exported from Shoreham and 
 Southhampton harbours and sold for    
 animal feed,flour milling or food.The 
 by-pass has little effect on this.    </content>
