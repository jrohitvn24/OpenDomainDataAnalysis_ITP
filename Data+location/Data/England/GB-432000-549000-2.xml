		<content> June 1985-because of the falling birth
 rate the 3 local comprehensive schools
 will merge into one &amp; move into a new 
 school at Dairy Lane by 1990.The      
 landlord &amp; landlady of the Robbie     
 Burns pub have had to learn to live   
 with 4 phantoms.The landlady,Janet    
 Porteous, met her first ghost when she
 went down the cellar &amp; was struck on  
 the back of the head.When she turned  
 round there was nobody there.The      
 couple's lounge clock has been        
 wrenched off the wall &amp; the one armed 
 bandit went round on its own whilst   
 banging is heard during the night.The 
 mischievous man in the cellar is      
 thought to be the late Tom Cardwell   
 who died when a beer barrel fell on   
 him in 1876. The others are a young   
 boy in short trousers,an old lady in a
 black skirt &amp; shawl &amp; a man who       
 shuffles through the bar.             </content>
