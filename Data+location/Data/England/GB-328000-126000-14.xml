		<title>14DURSTON CHURCH</title>
		<content>  St.John the Baptist,the Anglican     
 parish church at Durston,is an old    
 church in the Norman style.For        
 economic reasons the church is now in 
 a group of four churches which share  
 the same vicar.Durston was added to   
 this group in 1978.                   
  Durston has a population of approxim_
 ately one hundred and twenty. The     
 usual number of people attending      
 church on a Sunday is between twelve  
 and fifteen people.                   
  The vicar was sad to report that the 
 church was now kept locked.A pair of  
 brass candlesticks have already been  
 stolen and they wish to protect the   
 eighteenth century church silver.A key
 is kept in a neighbouring house and   
 the church will be opened on request. 
  This year a preservation order has   
 been put on a chest tomb in the       
 churchyard.                           </content>
