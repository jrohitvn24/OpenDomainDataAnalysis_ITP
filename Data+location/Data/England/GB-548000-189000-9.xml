		<title>09A DAY AT ST.EDWARD'S P.SCH.</title>
		<content>   On June 27th second year children   
 from St.Edward's Primary school went  
 to Goldhanger Field Centre (O.S.      
 089905).                              
   They left at 8.30 a.m. and arrived  
 at 9.45 a.m. after travelling 34      
 miles. On arrival, they went down to  
 the meadow and looked at grasses and  
 flowers, picking examples to press. In
 the afternoon, they went to the creek 
 on the Blackwater to look at the      
 little island and wildlife.           
   Back at the school, children were   
 working in their classrooms on Maths  
 and English. Two girls interviewed    
 Pat, the cleaner, who has lived in    
 Romford for 60 years and lives just a 
 short distance away from the school.  
 She said, "The area has changed       
 tremendously, I liked it as it was,   
 now it's too 'hubbubby' - too many    
 cars, too noisy".                     </content>
