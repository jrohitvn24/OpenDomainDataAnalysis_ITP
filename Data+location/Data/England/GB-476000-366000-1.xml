		<content>     The region is a rural area in N.  
 Notts., lying in the Trent Valley.    
 The area includes the villages of     
{Weston, Grassthorpe,}the southern part
 of{Normanton-on-Trent}and the northern
 end of{Sutton-on-Trent.}The A1 and the
 mainline railway run almost parallel  
 SE/NW across the region. Three lines  
 of pylons cross the area to converge  
 at the power station north of         
 Normanton. The villages are peaceful, 
 quiet places, with few buildings,     
 mostly residential, and of various    
 ages, some renovated. A  circular bus 
 service passes through twice daily,   
 en route to towns outside the area.   
 Generally the region is flat, and the 
 villages are surrounded by farmlands, 
 separated by hedges, and used for     
 mixed farming.There are no schools in 
 the survey area boundaries, though    
 Normanton and Sutton have Primaries.  </content>
