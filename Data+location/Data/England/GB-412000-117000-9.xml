		<title>09Retirement in Breamore</title>
		<content> I retired to Breamore about four years
 ago.I feel very fortunate in my first 
 experience of English village         
 life.Most of my working life has been 
 spent in cities, both in England and  
 abroad.In a way, living here is like  
 stepping back into the past,for the   
 house and streets have changed little 
 since the first Elizabeth' time.      
 .Perhaps this is a good thing, though 
 I'm sure the recent modernization of  
 some estate houses has been welcomed! 
 My day begins early,with prayer. I    
 then anxiously survey the havoc       
 wrecked downstairs by our new puppy.I 
 am hoping the obedience classes we    
 attend will make all our lives less   
 chaotic.Mornings are reserved for     
 paperwork,afternoons for getting out  
 and seeing people, my greatest        
 pleasure.Gardening and visiting the   
 New Forest are my other indulgences.  </content>
