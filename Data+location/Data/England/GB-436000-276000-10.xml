		<content> LITTER                                
 In the 4 square km. area we surveyed  
 we found a lot of litter, particularly
 near fences and hedges where the wind 
 had blown it.  Much was packaging     
 which had been carelessly discarded,  
 paper, cardboard, glass, and metal    
 were all in evidence.                 
   Willenhall Precinct was littered    
 with rubbish, dicarded food, and dog  
 excrement.  There were several        
 concrete litter containers around but 
 little use had been made of them. The 
 walls of the buildings in this area   
 were also covered with graffitti.     
 POLLUTION                             
 The River Sowe at Stoke Floods        
 contained eight supermarket trolleys, 
 a bread basket,a crate,a pram wheel as
 well as an assortment of other metal. 
 No pollution by oil, detergents or    
 other chemicals was found.            </content>
