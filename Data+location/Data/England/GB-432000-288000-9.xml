		<title>09GEORGE ELIOT HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>  The name is taken from the famous    
 19th Century novelist.The original    
 buildings were a workhouse,but these  
 were rebuilt in 1809 by French        
 prisoners of war.The Poyser block was 
 added during the 1890's,and more      
 buildings in 1939 in anticipation of  
 casualties from bombing raids.These   
 buildings are only now being replaced 
 by modern blocks with new wards.It is 
 an acute unit hospital with 390       
 beds,and does not deal with           
 emergencies.The maternity hospital on 
 the same site has 99 beds.Names of    
 wards are taken from Eliot's novels   
 e.g.Amos Barton,Lydgate,Janet and     
 Dorothea.Nurses uniforms-Student,white
 with yellow;S.R.N.,white with green;  
 Staff Nurse,white with blue;Sister,   
 blue with blue belt,white hat.        
  A computer is now used to assist with
 administration work.                  </content>
