		<title>04DE LA POLE HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> On Friday 28th June 1985 our group    
 went to visit De La Pole hospital to  
 see how they lived and how it looked  
 .We arrived there and split up into   
 two groups(boys and girls) a male     
 nurse took us to a ward where old     
 people go in an afternoon to make     
 toys,puppets and clothes.They are told
 to do these things themselves.        
 The nurse then took us into a woodwork
 room where only 4-5 people go at one  
 time and there they make stools and   
 chairs.The man then swapped groups and
 had another man to take us to a ward  
 where people slept.There are 4 people 
 to a room.In this ward are 4 special  
 beds which when you put your foot on a
 peddle it goes up or down,these beds  
 cost about Â£1000  each.
