		<content> There is very little industry in the  
 area.  Infact the industry that does  
 exist is with farming.  An example of 
 this is the dairy.                    
                                       
 The only big housing area is found on 
 the eastern edge of the grid.  Here   
 there are council housing estates.    
 These form the edge of Bath.          
                                       
   At the present there are two        
 problems that concern the people      
 living in this country area.  One is  
 the closure of the village school in  
 Englishcombe.  The school is due to   
 close at the end of the summer term   
 1985.  The other problem concerns     
 dairy farming, described elsewhere in 
 the survey.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
