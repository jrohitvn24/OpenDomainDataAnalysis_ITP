 Cheddar.Loads of tourists come to     
 Cheddar every year so many that the   
 tourist industry provides the main    
 income for many people.To cope with   
 all this there are plenty of{bed and  
{breakfast}places and licensed         
 hotels.Tourists love Cheddar for{the  
{gorge, the cheese, the friendly people
 and the{relaxed atmosphere.}The       
 friendly atmosphere of Cheddar makes  
 it a beautiful place but we must not  
 forget the business side of things.

 to cope with everyones needs plus lots
 of{souvenir shops}in the gorge.As for

 the main attraction, a beautiful site 
 carved many millions of years ago.
