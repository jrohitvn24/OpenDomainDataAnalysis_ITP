		<title>16LIFE STYLES RED LION PUB</title>
		<content>The Red Lion public house was first    
built in the fourteenth century        
probably about 1380. At the beginning  
of the nineteenth century, the original
building was burnt down and for two    
years the pub moved to a house 200     
yards along the road. In 1830 the Red  
Lion was re-opened on its present site.
The pub grounds occupy about one       
and three quarters acres altogether.   
The pub contains a restaurant which is 
well known locally for the high quality
of its food. There is only one small   
bar which does not allow enough room   
for traditional pub games, such as     
darts.The most popular drink is bitter 
beer which sells for 80p a pint, while 
the average price of a bottle of wine  
is four pounds.The landlord employs one
bar person and one cleaner, while his  
wife helps in the kitchen. A lack of   
main drainage means primitive toilets. </content>
