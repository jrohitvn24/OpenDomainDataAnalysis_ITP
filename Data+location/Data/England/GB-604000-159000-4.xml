		<title>04What Farmers Do in Boughton</title>
		<content>   Most farms in our block survive by  
 growing a wide variety of crops.This  
 means many duties are required.In the 
 hop fields you can see Mr. Lyons on   
 his stilts,or using a long pole,to tie
 up the strings to the wires for the   
 hops to grow up.                      
   Some farmers do lots of spraying.In 
 Spring they spray the young buds to   
 protect them against mildew and       
 aphids.Later they spray them to keep  
 the fruit on the trees until they are 
 ready for picking.In winter they spray
 to kill any over-wintering pests.This 
 has caused some of us at school to get
 sore throats.                         
   Lots of mums go picking in summer to
 get some holiday money.Some farmers   
 don't hire pickers,instead they have  
 "Pick-Your Own" signs.People come and 
 pick what they want,then have it      
 weighed and priced as they go out.    </content>
