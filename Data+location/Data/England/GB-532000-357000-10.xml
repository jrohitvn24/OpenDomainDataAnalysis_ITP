		<title>1050 years ago in Stickney.</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr.Pickering, who has  
 lived in Stickney all his life.He was 
 born in 1912 and started school in    
 1917, when he was five years  old.    
 Everybody had to leave school when    
 they were fourteen years old.There    
 were about 130 children in the school,
 aged 5-14 years.Now there are about   
 105 children in the school,because    
 when children are 11 years old they   
 go to secondary school.The children   
 used to write on slates.Today in      
 Stickney there are only 2 pubs,but 60 
 years ago there were 7 pubs.The church
 has not changed much at all,except    
 that it did not used to have any      
 electricity.Children had to go to     
 sunday school,which was held at       
 school,in the library.The vicar       
 used to live in the Rectory next to   
 the church, but this has now been made
 into an old peoples home.             </content>
