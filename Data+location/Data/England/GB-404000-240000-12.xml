		<content>  The ordinary pews are where cottagers
 would sit and another kind called "box
 pews" where families from grand houses
 would sit.                            
  Above the chancel arch is a Royal    
 Coat of Arms. There are traces of an  
 earlier one underneath.               
  In the chancel is a very grand tomb  
 made of alabaster. It shows the       
 figures of Sir Samuel Sandys and his  
 wife and children. In the tomb next to
 the Sandys tomb is the eldest son Sir 
 Edwyn Sandys, with his wife and       
 children.                             
  Another tomb in the chancel is that  
 of Penelope Washington, a relative of 
 George Washington, first President of 
 the U.S.A. It shows the Washington    
 Coat of Arms, the prototype of the    
 stars and stripes of the American     
 flag.
