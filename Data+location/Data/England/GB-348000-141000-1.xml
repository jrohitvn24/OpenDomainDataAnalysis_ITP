		<content> The area is almost entirely flat      
 low-lying grassland known locally as  
 "Moors".  The soil is of peat and the 
 water table is a metre or two below   
 the level of the ground.  The fields  
 are drained with long, wide straight  
 ditches known as "Rhynes" which need  
 to be dug out frequently.  These serve
 as wet-fences for keeping livestock   
 in, and are prettily lined with willow
 trees.  fields are sometimes flooded  
 in winter.  It is very sparcely       
 populated, the chief activity being   
 dairy farming with some beef and      
 sheep.  Small apple orchards are      
 attached to farms. Cider is made on   
 one farm and sold to the public.      
 fishing is a popular pastime.  One of 
 our rarer birds, the heron is         
 frequently seen as are other water    
 birds.  Fenny Castle is the site of a 
 motte and Bailey castle.              </content>
