		<title>08A Haslington Child's Day.</title>
		<content> On Sunday I wake up at 6o'clock and   
 wash and get dressed. I hate making   
 the bed after I've got my brother     
 Ashley out. Then I go downstairs and  
 make four bowls of Cornflakes when the
 rest of the family come down. It gets 
 very noisy and hectic. After we've had
 breakfast and put the dishes in the   
 dish washer we go out to mow the lawns
 and trim the hedges. Last week I      
 picked the blackcurrants and put them 
 in a bowl. It took ages.              
 In the afternoon, after lunch,we      
 usaually play in the garden or        
 sometimes we go out on a trip.        
   Sunday is a relaxing day but there  
 isn't much to do. In the evening we   
 play out but if the weather is bad we 
 watch television with our parents.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
