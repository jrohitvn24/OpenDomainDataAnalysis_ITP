		<title>18Church Bells</title>
		<content>   There are{six bells}in the belfrey  
 of Beckwithshaw Church, each one being
{dedicated}to a member of the          
 Williams family, who paid for the     
 building of the church.               
   The{Tenor}bell being named Henry    
 after father, the{5th}bell after Ellen
 the mother, the{4th, 3rd and 2nd}after
 John, Mary and Annie Dugdale children 
 of the first marriage of Mrs. Williams
 The{Treble}bell being called after    
 Joshua the child of the marriage of   
 Mr.and Mrs. Williams.                 
   The bells were brought from London  
 from the foundry of{Mears and         
{Stainbeck}- still in business today at
 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.         
   Rather a large peal of bells for    
 such a small church.
