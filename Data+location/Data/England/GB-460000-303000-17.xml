		<content>{St.Barnabas Library;}The library on   
 St.Barnabas Rd.was built in 1937 but  
 has altered a lot over the years.     
 There are over 80,000 books,some of   
 them in other languages such as Polish
 &amp; Urdu. Monday is the busiest day &amp;   
 fiction the most popular book. Other  
 services include records,tapes &amp; photo
 copying. The library is very much part
 of the community with play schemes &amp;  
 clubs for the able &amp; disabled.        
 Services for children include story   
 reading,book clubs &amp; the reading bus  
 that visits local venues during school
 holidays.{                            
{Humberstone Library}used to be in the 
 old village chapel but despite        
 controversy it was closed in 1983. In 
 response partly to local protests a   
 mobile library was provided.This,     
 however,proved to be a poor substitute
 &amp; a new library has been built.       </content>
