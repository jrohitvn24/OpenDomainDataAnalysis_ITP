		<title>19Population survey Ashford C.</title>
		<content> We concluded from the results of our  
 survey that many people living in our 
 area have not lived here all their    
 lives.Many people are retired and have
 moved here for their retirement.      
 Unemployment is low,with many people  
 working on farms or self-employed.Most
 people travel under 10 miles to work. 
 There is considerable variety in the  
 types of houses found in our area.Many
 are detached houses or bungalows with 
 a wide range of building materials    
 used-brick,stone,timber-framed. There 
 are a number of houses over 200 years 
 old,many of which have been used for  
 purposes other than housing during    
 their history.There has also been a   
 substantial number of houses built in 
 the last 20 years,including a few     
 small,select housing estates.
