		<title>18Attington Stud</title>
		<content>Attington Stud is a 120 acre stud farm 
on the Tetsworth to Postcombe road. It 
was built in 1742 as two cottages but  
through the years it has been extended 
into a large mansion. Within the       
grounds is accomodation for the        
families who work on the estate. Horses
bred on the estate are for the flat    
races. There are some twenty five      
horses altogether at the stud, five of 
which are brood mares. So far, the stud
has yet to produce a famous racehorse, 
although the dam of a well-known one is
now kept there. The horses have won at 
least twelve races between them. The   
foals are sold to stables all over the 
country. They are sold as yearlings.   
When the horses need new shoes they are
taken to the blacksmiths in Thame.
