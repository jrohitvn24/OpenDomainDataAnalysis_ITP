		<title>05RESIDENTIAL CARAVAN SITE.</title>
		<content> We have lived in a caravan nearly a   
 year.In the summer we had no Electri- 
 city.Then we moved into one that we   
 rented for Â£25 a week,the water still 
 didn't run but there was a tap outside
 The fire wasn't giving off much heat  
 so we moved into a residential caravan
 that had electricity,water,and radiat-
 ors.This was about Â£200 a month but   
 was too much so we moved back into our
 first one.We do not have a toilet so  
 we use the public ones.Someone put a  
 rat down the ladies toilet.There are  
 two sets of swings,two yellow,and two 
 peppermint coloured ones.There is also
 a climbing frame and a roundabout in  
 the shape of a witch's hat.There is a 
 shop open in the summer.Next door to  
 the caravan there is a farm,there are 
 hens,peacocks,cows,bulls,and goats.   
 We are moving into a new house soon.
