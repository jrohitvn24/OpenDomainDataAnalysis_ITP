		<content> The old flour mill buildings are now  
 in use at Shepherds Yeat for making   
 oak palings for sale to local farmers,
 garden centres and at the agricultural
 shows in Lakeland, two farms are now  
 at the stage of producing vegetables  
 and salad crops for sale to the       
 wholesale market in Windermere, which 
 is now expanding. This is a very new  
 industrial project which may develop. 
 The Cheales family in Winster are     
 making small animals, such as voles,  
 squirrels and field mice, sculptured  
 in cotton wool and painted exquisitely
 in the natural colours. A window with 
 a display of these in Windermere town 
 is at present collecting orders and   
 also inviting enquiries from the      
 trade.
