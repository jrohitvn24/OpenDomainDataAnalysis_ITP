    {JUNIORS}games are a bit different,
 a lot of the boys play football,      
 rounders and cricket.                 
    I think elastic games are the most 
 popular game for girls in our school  
 at the moment.                        
    The elastic game is played with 3-4
 people, 2 are standing inside a long  
 piece of elastic, and the other person
 has to jump up, down, in, and out of  
 the elastic. This game is called      
 England, Ireland. The game gets harder
 by adjusting the elastic higher.      
    Poisoned well is a game where you  
 stand around a circle holding hands   
 with a group of friends, and keep     
 turning around.                       
    The object of the game is to try to
 pull the other people in, but to keep 
 out yourself.
