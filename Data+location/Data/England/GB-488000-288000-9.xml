		<title>09Entertainment in Corby.</title>
		<content>There is a variety of entertainment    
available in Corby, most of which is   
quite inexpensive, as loans and grants 
from Govt. and regional funds are used 
to support the cost.                   
Indoor facilities include a Civic      
Theatre Complex, Olympic standard      
swimming pool, with sauna and jacuzzi, 
and a number of sports centres offering
a wide variety of sporting             
opportunities. There is also a Library 
and two cinemas (in the same building).
Outdoor facilities are equally as good.
Almost in the town centre are many     
acres of woodland for walking and there
is an boating lake in the centre of    
these which provides boating and       
fishing as well as pop concerts in the 
summer. There is also an 18 hole golf  
course and in 1985 a huge outdoor      
sports complex was opened in the town  
by Neil Kinnock, the Labour Leader.    </content>
