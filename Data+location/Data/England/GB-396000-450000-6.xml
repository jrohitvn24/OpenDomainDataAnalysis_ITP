		<content> Where I live down Broughton Road there
 are two old women, who have lived in  
 Skipton for all of their lives. One is
 92 year old &amp; the other is 83.        
                                       
  They live at 10, Greenfield street   
 and descrbed to me what old Skipton   
 was like:                             
   {In their time, back in the 1920's, 
{the street that they live in was      
{called Greenfield Avenue. All the     
{other streets around were  built when 
{the Rose Hewitt Mill was first built. 
{A lot of labourers found themselves   
{living there. Ings School was built in
{1910. Ruth Green, the younger of the  
{two sisters, actually went to Ings    
{School. There were no shops around    
{Broughton road during that time, so   
{they had to go to Swadford street to  
{do their shopping.                    
                                  Cont.</content>
