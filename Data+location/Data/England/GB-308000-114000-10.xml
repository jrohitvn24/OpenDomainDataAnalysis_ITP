		<content> Horse-riding is a popular sport and   
 horses for racing and riding are well 
 catered for.                          
 At POND FARM there is an impressive   
 training establishment - founded in   
 1977 - for 32 National Hunt Race      
 Horses and 18 other Race Horses       
 being presented for the Flat.  A      
 seven-furlong all-weather Gallop has  
 been constructed and a snow-blowing   
 machine bought to keep it clear.  The 
 Stables, sited on a 300 acre farm,    
 house a walking machine, a weighing   
 machine, an Equine Pool and a solarium
 as well as many paddocks. There is a  
 bungalow for staff and a hostel for 15
 stable lads, a covered ride and a     
 laboratory to check the blood counts  
 of the horses.                        
 At BENSHAYNE FARM there is a large    
 Stable Complex with horses for riding.
