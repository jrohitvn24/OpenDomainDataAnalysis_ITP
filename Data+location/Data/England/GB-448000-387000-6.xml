		<title>06Unemployment in Thurcroft</title>
		<content> When we did our Employment Survey     
 during July,1985,we asked questions   
 concerning unemployment.South         
 Yorkshire is an area of high          
 unemployment and we wanted to see how 
 Thurcroft fitted into the pattern.    
 Among our sample we found that 23%    
 were unemployed.The figure for the    
 Rotherham area is 19% and the figure  
 for the whole of South Yorkshire is   
 22%.The difference between our figure 
 and the Rotherham figure is probably  
 due to our sample.Thurcroft seems to  
 be typical of most of South Yorkshire.
 We also asked about length of         
 unemployment.In our sample 40% had    
 been unemployed for less than 1 year, 
 33% for between 1 and 3 years and 27% 
 for longer than 3 years.Because the   
 sample of unemployed was fairly small 
 these figures may not give us an      
 accurate picture.                     </content>
