		<title>02Mentmore Towers</title>
		<content> Sitting in the 'Gold Room' and        
 listening to a piano being played in  
 the background, I was told that       
 Mentmore Towers, built in 1855 for{   
{Baron Rothschild}and later occupied by
 his daughter, is now the headquarters 
 of the{British Seat of the World      
{Government of the Age of              
{Enlightenment,}run by a charity       
 organisation. The residents of        
 Mentmore village are able to make free
 use of the 90 acres of parkland       
 surrounding the Towers and show no    
 concern about the present use of the  
 buildings. To assist with the         
 maintainance and upkeep, film work,   
 TV commercials and private functions  
 bring in an income, as does the annual
 Craft Fair. An aura of peacefulness   
 prevails as people pass through the   
 beautifully preserved and ornate      
 rooms.                                </content>
