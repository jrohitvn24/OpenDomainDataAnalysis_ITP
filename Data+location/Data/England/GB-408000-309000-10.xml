		<content>    Most parents in our schools have   
jobs. We found that one in every ten is
unemployed. Lichfield is visited by    
tourists, and many people work in      
hotels, restaurants and public houses. 
A large proportion of parents work in  
factories, offices and in the          
Industrial Estates. Very few women stay
at home. Many have part time jobs in   
Lichfield. Many women work full time as
teachers, nurses, and as typists in    
banks, building societies and shops.   
Both men and women travel to other     
towns for their jobs. In general, the  
men travel further than the women. The 
men work as sales representatives and  
managers of shops and offices. Some own
restaurants or work as doctors or      
nurses. Many people have moved into    
Lichfield, because their jobs moved to 
the area.
