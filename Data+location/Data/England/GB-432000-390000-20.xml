		<content>   {Bassetts}make sweets like liqourice
 Allsorts, Jelly Babies, Wine Gums,    
 Sherbert Fountains, Popcorn and Dolly 
 Mixtures. All this is known a sugar   
 confectionary.                        
   {Bassetts}employ 2000 people, only  
 1500 of these people actually work in 
 the factory, the other 500 go out and 
 sell the products. 250 of the factory 
 employees are men who do the          
 maintenance and heavy work. The other 
 1250 workers are women who do most of 
 the light sweetmaking work.           
   The sweet operators can work three  
 five hour shifts. The jobs don't get  
 boring because they rotate the work.  
 There are hygiene rules like wearing  
 special clothes and no nail polish.   
   The thing we found amazing was how  
 quickly they make the sweets. The     
 sweets are great !
