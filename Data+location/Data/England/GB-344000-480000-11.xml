		<content>{Sport} The promenade at Sandside      
 provides good facilities for anglers, 
 and the farms and marshland across the
 estuary attract wildfowlers. The river
 currents and the fast-rising tides are
 treacherous and preclude most water   
 sports. A playing field provides for  
 football, hockey and cricket, and     
 badminton occurs in the village hall. 
{Formalised Outdoor Activities}There is
 a Gardening Association and a number  
 of Fetes and Sports Events organised  
 by school and church groups, together 
 with a Playing Field Association. The 
 Sunday School includes a Young        
 Explorers Group.                      
{Informal Outdoor Activities}The       
 natural environment gives wide scope  
 to the rambler, natural historian and 
 bird watcher. The views and sunsets   
 are captured by the artist and        
 photographer.                         </content>
