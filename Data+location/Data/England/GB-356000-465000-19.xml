		<title>19CLAUGHTON/FARLETON FLOODS</title>
		<content> On August 8th 1967 a freak downpour   
swept a 30 foot gulley in a tributary  
of Farleton Beck above Manor House     
Farm.The beck flooded Brades Farm farm-
house and outbuildings and swept a     
boulder 3 feet in diameter into the    
farmyard.Claughton Beck was blocked    
when a tractor and tree branches were  
trapped under the A683 bridge.This     
diverted the beck over the lane leading
to Claughton Hall,washing away an      
outbuilding adjoining the barn,2 stout 
6 foot gate-posts and the extension on 
the side of Shaw House Farm.The Fenwick
Arms was flooded to a depth of 4 feet  
and a section of railway line was left 
suspended in mid-air.Claughton Beck has
since been reinforced by a retaining   
wall at the foot of the lane at Shaw   
House Farm and flood embankments line  
the streams as they cross the Lune     
flood plain.                           </content>
