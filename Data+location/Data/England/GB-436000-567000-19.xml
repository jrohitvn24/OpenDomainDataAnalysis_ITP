		<title>19RECREATION IN SOUTH SHIELDS</title>
		<content> Along the North Foreshore, a new road 
 is to be built. The land near the     
 beach is being developed commercially 
 for leisure purposes. Nearby is the   
 lifeboat memorial to designer William 
 Wouldhave. This area is being tidied  
 up and given new lighting schemes. The
 Amusement Park has many facilities to 
 attract the day-visitor. Some of the  
 illuminated signs, which surround the 
 area, have been designed by local     
 artist Robert Olley. Opposite the     
 beach are the Marine Parks. The South 
 Marine Park has fountains in the      
 boating lake, a miniature railway and 
 a paddling pool for children.         
 Provision is being made for a caravan 
 site in Bents Park. An elevated       
 walkway is being built on the         
 Foreshore to give views of the beaches
 and sea. An amphitheatre will stage   
 exhibitions and plays.                </content>
