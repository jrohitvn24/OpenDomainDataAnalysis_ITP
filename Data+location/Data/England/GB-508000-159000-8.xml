		<content> "On a Saturday morning I usually wake 
 up to my brother saying, "Wake up".   
 When I hear him I shut my eyes, snore 
 and pretend to be asleep. He goes out.
 Peace! At about 8am I go down and     
 watch the TV. When the programme's    
 finished I go and get dressed and have
 my breakfast of sausages. After       
 breakfast I feed my rabbit and go out 
 to play.                              
 At about 1.30 I come in for lunch     
 which is only a snack. Then after     
 lunch I go back and play games like { 
{1,2,3 see you} and {It}or I go and    
 ride my bike.                         
 At about 6pm I go in and have tea     
 which is usually mince or curry. After
 tea I get ready for bed and watch a   
 film. At about 9.30 I go to my bunk   
 bed in my own room and read adventure 
 stories until 9.45."
