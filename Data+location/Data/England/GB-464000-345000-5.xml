		<content>   Some people think that Lowdham      
 Grange is a police station of some    
 kind but it is a borstal.In some ways 
 they are the same,the officers wear   
 uniform and they have cells but people
 only go in there if they have done    
 something wrong.                      
   There are two farms nearby called   
 Grange Farm and Hunters Hill Farm.Both
 have cows but Hunters Hill has pigs   
 and hens as well.                     
   Also there is an estate on the land 
 with about seventy houses,but only    
 forty of them are being lived in.     
   There are woods,cricket and football
 pitches,a swimming pool and a club.   
   A bus service passes the bottom of  
 the back drive and there are two      
 school buses,one for the local        
 Comprehensive at Calverton and one for
 Lowdham C.E. Primary School.
