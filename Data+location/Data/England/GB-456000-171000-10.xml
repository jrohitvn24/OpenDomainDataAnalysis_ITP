		<content> The study area is poorly served by the
{bus service.}This is due to its poor  
 accessibility from major roads and its
 winding narrow lanes and steep hills  
 which make up the area. A{once-weekly 
 bus service serves{Stanford Dingley   
 itself. The main service goes through 
{Bradfield}between{Reading}and{Newbury,
 3 times a day between 8.00 a.m and    
 5.00 p.m, with no Sunday service.     
 Apart from the one-man{Mini Cab       
 service which serves this area, there 
 is a{volunteer transport service}for  
 O.A.Ps. Transport to the nearest      
 school which is 6 miles away relies   
 upon the bus service or private cars. 
 There is a{mobile library}which visits
 the area once a week.
