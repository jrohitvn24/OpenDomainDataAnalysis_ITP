        Much of the block is at or     
 below high water level. No natural    
 plot has been discovered more than 15 
 metres above sea level.               
        Dykes or ditches criss cross   
 the whole area. They carry water from 
 the agricultural land to the estuary. 
 They can be up to 10 metres wide, are 
 at least 5 metres deep and run for    
 many kilometres. One dyke runs from   
 Suddle Wood near Keelby , Lincs. on a 
 journey of some 7 km. The dykes become
 swollen after heavy rain and become a 
 serious danger to children. Many have 
 drowned in the dykes.                 
        Because of the variation in    
 water rate, and depth, normal water   
 related wild life is limited.
