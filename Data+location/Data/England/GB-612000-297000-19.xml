		<content>{In the shop,date-coding is a nightmare
 - once on fats/biscuits now on canned/
 bottled soft drinks/beers dating from 
 3 months ahead to 1990!{Ordering is   
{difficult}-orders can't keep pace with
 popular items then just as suddenly   
 popularity fades.Products popular when
{TV}ads appear then don't sell when Ads
 off-air.Recent{TV}piece on sausages &amp; 
 their large fat content resulted in   
 sales dropping &amp; customers looking for
 alternatives.Sales of porkpies/pasties
 have slumped &amp; cake/biscuits checked  
 for additives. After closing - shelves
 are sorted out, freezers de-frosted;  
 book-work done and with dreaded VAT of
 15% only on some goods this causes fun
 &amp; games when stock-taking! Open every 
 day except Sunday;{the nationwide dis-
{cussion now is Sunday opening -we feel
{Sunday is our 1 day of rest &amp; a family
{day - others have leisure,why not us? </content>
