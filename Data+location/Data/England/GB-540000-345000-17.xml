		<content> This year's show was almost ruined by 
 the weather as at 12-30pm just as the 
 show was opening the heavens opened   
 and we were drenched by a violent     
 thunderstorm which deposited one third
 of an inch(8mm) of rain in half an    
 hour.Fortunately the field in which   
 the show was held is very well drained
 and the sun eventually shone.Those who
 attended enjoyed the afternoon's      
 events and a profit was made which    
 will benefit the funds of the Village 
 Hall.Preparations will soon be in hand
 for next year's show.
