		<title>04The Broxbourne Lido</title>
		<content> The Broxbourne Lido was completed in  
 1978 and opened on July 14th. It was  
 built as a part of the Lea Valley Park
 leisure facility. The Lido is built on
 a big hill made our of gravel and is  
 built like a raft.                    
 The Lido is good fun because there is 
 a wave machine and a slide and        
 fountain. The wave machine goes on    
 every hour and it floods the side of  
 the pool.                             
 Every year about 300,000 people come  
 to the Broxbourne Lido and it is      
 really fairly popular. This is        
 probably because of its close         
 proximity to London. The Lido has got 
 a nice play area with climbing frames 
 that goes right down to the river.    
 The busiest time is at weekends,      
 especially Sundays. It is also very   
 busy there in school holidays.
