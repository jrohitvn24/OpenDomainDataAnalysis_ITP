		<content> Formerly an area of small{villages,   
 Plymstock, Hooe, Turnchapel and       
 Oreston, concerned mainly with farming
 and fishing and linked to Plymouth by 
 ferry and railway, during this century
 it has been engulfed by the growth of 
 Plymouth. The area is now dominated by
 post war{housing estates,}mainly      
 privately owned, with most people     
{commuting}to Plymouth by car each day 
 across the Laira Bridge. A            
 semi-rural atmosphere, easy access    
 to the coast and city have made this  
 a popular{residential suburb}which    
 continues to{spread}to the south.A    
 large comprehensive school and        
 shopping precinct were built in       
 the 1960's to serve the{growing       
{population}but there is very little   
 industry except for{waterfront        
{sites.}The citadel standing on the Hoe
 is one of many{tourist attractions.   </content>
