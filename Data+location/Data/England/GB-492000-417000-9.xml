		<content> It was 6.30 am and my Dad woke me up  
 with a shout that could wake up the   
 whole house. I got out of bed and got 
 my school clothes on. Next I sneaked  
 down the stairs trying not to wake my 
 little brothers up who are lazy bones.
 When I got down my Dad had gone to    
 work and so I had to make my own      
 breakfast. After I had finished it was
 spot on 7am. Soon my big brother got  
 up so I decided to get ready for      
 school. I set off for school at 8.30. 
 School is good because I like doing   
 maths and English. Also I like dinner 
 because of the puddings. At dinner    
 play I play football. When school is  
 over I walk home with my friend and   
 his brother. When I get home I have   
 my tea then play football outside with
 my friend. After 3-4 hours I go in and
 watch TV. After I have watched what I 
 want I go to bed.                     </content>
