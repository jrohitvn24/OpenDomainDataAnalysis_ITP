		<title>15Village Life in Wiltshire.</title>
		<content> My grandad is 78. He has lived in a   
 village all his life. He likes living 
 in the country and wouldn't like to   
 see any changes. After getting up he  
 has breakfast about 9 o'clock. He does
 some gardening. After dinner he       
 watches television.                   
 There used to be two chicken farms    
 nearby, one at Woodstock House and one
 at Brackenbeds, but they are no longer
 there.                                
 When he was young the{village school} 
 had about 65 pupils. There was one    
 teacher in the little room and three  
 in the big room. In the playground the
 boys and the girls were separated by a
 fence.                                
 He remembers two coronations          
 and war time evacuees from London.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
