		<title>14SURROUNDING FARMLAND.</title>
		<content> During the month of June the farmland 
 surrounding Horndon on the Hill blazed
 brilliant yellow with flowers of the  
 rape seed.The majority of fields seem 
 to be growing either rape seed or     
 barley.Other crops seen were potatoes 
 and broad beans.The main field        
 boundaries seem to be either ditches  
 or hedges.Several well marked public  
 footpaths also acted as field         
 boundaries.Numerous bees were seen    
 whilst walking through the rape       
 field.At Horndon house farm twelve bee
 hives were seen.The bee keeper        
 explained that he made honey and sold 
 it at local shows for Â£1.00 a jar.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
