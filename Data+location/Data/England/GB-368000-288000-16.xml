		<title>16COCKFIGHTING AT EARDINGTON</title>
		<content>     In the lonely and peaceful county 
 of shropshire, a Terrier show was     
 supposedly taking place at{Little Moor
{Ridding kennels,}just outside         
 Bridgnorth.                           
                                       
      A tipoff was given to the police 
 and the RSPCA from an anonymous       
 phonecall letting it be known that{   
{cockfighting,}an illegal sport, was   
 going to take place at the kennels.   
                                       
     The event was already taking place
 when police closed in. Participants   
 tried to escape, leaving their cars   
 behind and fleeing across fields.

 the registrations were traced.        
 The people who  were involved were    
 intervieued and one man{arrested.}The}
 court case is due soon.
