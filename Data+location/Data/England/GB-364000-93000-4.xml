		<title>04Dairying on Stratton Farm</title>
		<content> Stratton Farm maintains two dairies.  
 Each acts independently and has one   
 hundred and thirty Friesan milking    
 cows each, most bred on the farm.     
 There are two bulls: a Hereford and an
 Aberdeen Angus.  Thirty calves at any 
 one time are kept down at the farm.   
 The milk yield today from Higher Dairy
 from one hundred and ten cows in milk 
 was one thousand seven hundred        
 litres.  A day's supply is stored in  
 water-cooled vats and collected       
 daily by tanker at 10.00 am. It is    
 sent to Chard Junction for butter or  
 cheese.                               
 The cows fresh in milk are kept in at 
 nights from October and the whole herd
 is kept under shed cover during the   
 coldest period of the winter. They are
 fed on silage and cow cake            
 concentrates during this time.
