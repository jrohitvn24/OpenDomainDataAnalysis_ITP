		<content>    This D-Block covers the villages of
 Bisbrooke, Seaton and Harringworth and
 their immediate environs. All three   
 villages are small - probably no more 
 than fifty houses in each one - and   
 they are surrounded by rolling arable 
 farmland. Each village has a church   
 and a pub, but Harringworth is the    
 only one with a shop.                 
                                       
    Each village is picturesque in its 
 own way, being a mixture of pretty    
 cottages and modern stone houses. The 
 dwellings are usually enhanced by     
 attractive gardens, in June a mass of 
 multi-coloured roses.                 
                                       
    The dominant architectural feature 
 of the area is the Harringworth,      
 Seaton, or Welland Viaduct, over one  
 hundred years old.
