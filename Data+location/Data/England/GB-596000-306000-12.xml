		<title>12HALL FARM</title>
		<content> The farm covers 700 acres of arable   
 land with barbed wire fencing and     
 natural hedgerows. The largest field  
 is 114 acres. The farmer and his 5    
 employees mainly grow wheat for seed. 
 They also grow barley,oil seed rape,  
 peas for animal feed and grass for    
 silage. All crops, except peas and    
 beet are autumn sown. The fields are  
 spread with a variety of fertilizers  
 including nitrogen, phosphate,        
 potash,lime, magnesium, copper and    
 farmyard manure. The crops are sprayed
 from the air with insecticides,       
 herbicides and fungicides. They do not
 irrigate the crops. Beet-harvesters,  
 combines and tractors are used for    
 harvesting. Harvested crops are stored
 in grain bins on ventilated open      
 floors. The crops' destinations are   
 beet-factories and seed merchants     
 throughout Britain.                   </content>
