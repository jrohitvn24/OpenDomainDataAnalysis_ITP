		<title>11WRAGBY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Wragby is a pleasant village          
 surrounded by woods and open fields   
 close to Nostell Priory. It is        
 dominated by sandstone houses which   
 provide a warm and friendly           
 environment.                          
   The village is very typical of the  
 area and encompasses much of that     
 Yorkshire men hold dear, such as      
 cricket and rugby pitches with the    
 obligatory public house near the      
 centre of Wragby.                     
    The chief problem in the village is
 the main Doncaster road, the A638,    
 which cuts Wragby in half and carries 
 heavy traffic including lorries       
 thoughout the day and night. Most of  
 the village inhabitants find this a   
 nuisance especially the large         
 proportion of elderly people who have 
 lived there all their lives.
