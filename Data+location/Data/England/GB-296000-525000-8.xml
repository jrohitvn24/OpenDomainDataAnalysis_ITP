		<title>08CUMBERLAND SAUSAGE</title>
		<content>    One of the foods that is unique to 
 Cumbria is the{Cumberland sausage.    
 Basically it is a{pork sausage}with   
 different{herbs and spices.}Most      
 butchers make their own sausage and as
 far as I know it is not mass produced 
 or sold in pre packs or frozen.       
    At first Cumberland sausage may not
 appear very nice to the eye as it     
 lacks the smooth texture of the miced 
 meat of ordinary sausage. It also has 
 a{strong taste}and is very{fatty      
 meaning that it was probably a strong 
 favourite among the poor of the past  
 who could afford this meat.           
    After trying Cumberland sausage a  
 few times I got used to it's strong   
 taste and now I quite like it. Indeed 
 I often have it for breakfast.
