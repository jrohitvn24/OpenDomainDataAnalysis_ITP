 The church at{Westhope}is made of     
 corrugated iron, but has a pleasing   
 atmosphere and attracts many people,  
 from all the group of parishes,to its 
{Childrens Services}taken by a lay     
 reader.When there is a fifth Sunday in
 the month a{Joint Service}is held at  
 one of the Churches.These Sevices are 
 always well attended, and people enjoy
 socialising afterwards over a cup of  
 coffee.Apart from these occasions,    
 Services are not well attended,       
 especially in the winter, many of the 
 loyal parishioners being elderly.     
 All the Churches receive support from 
 the other parishes when fund_raising. </content>
