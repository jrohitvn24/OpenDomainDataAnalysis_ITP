		<title>14THE NETHERLEY SHOW.</title>
		<content>   Every year the{Netherley Show}is    
 held at our school. The estate has a  
 lot of{social problems}so 14 years ago
 some people began to hold a{carnival} 
 to try to lift peoples'{morale.}This  
 grew into a big show where 10,000     
 attend during the first week in{June.}
 The{teachers}collect the entrance fee 
 of 20 pence and they keep 60% of      
 this to{subsidise}school trips for    
 us. All{profit}from the show goes to  
{local charities.}I like going to the  
 show because there is a lot to do for{
{all ages.}I think that the{Fun Fair}is
 best. There was a ride one year that  
 turned you upsidedown and all your    
 money fell out of your pockets. There 
 is Horse Jumping, Morris Dancing,     
 5-a-side Football, and BMX contests,  
 brass bands and parachute jumps. The  
 worst thing about the show is the{    
{litter}which spoils the field for days</content>
