{Crabbs Green}is a small owner occupied
 arable farm of l32 acres. The present 
 timber framed house was built about   
 l580, and altered at various times    
 since. The name possibly comes from   
 one of the early owners John Crabb.   
 The present owner occupiers are 3rd   
 generation.  The grandparents moved in
 in l889, and started a retail{milk    
{round}in Hatfield Broad Oak in l90l.  
 The milk was then produced from a herd
 of cows kept at the farm. Since l953  
 milk has been bought in from a        
 wholesale dairy. There is now 1 farm  
 worker and 1 milk roundswoman and the 
 owners. There are two old timber      
 framed barns, a new implement shed and
 grain silo and a few smaller brick    
 built sheds.
