		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY, CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> The War Office bought most of the     
 agricultural land in All Saint's      
 Parish of Chitterne in 1937, including
 farms and farm cottages. Until this   
 time water had been obtained from two 
 communal wells or from garden wells by
 those who had their own. The War      
 Office brought piped water to the     
 properties they had bought and this   
 came from two windmills situated on   
 the hills on either side of Chitterne.
 The West Wilts. Water Authority was   
 permitted to tap these pipes to       
 provide water for the rest of the     
 village. Mains water came in 1969.    
 Electricity also came in 1937. Older  
 people in the village remember the    
 narrow road and humpback bridge and   
 how the village was often flooded in  
 winter. Many people had friends and   
 relations in Imber and would walk     
 across the Plain to visit them.       </content>
