		<content>  In our school we have two big        
 classrooms where we work most of the  
 time. They have a high roof which     
 looks like a triangle with lots of    
 beams. In the Junior classroom we have
 a Maths. cupboard and a big cupboard  
 for books and paper.In one corner of  
 the room is a book corner, we have a  
 lot of books. We have two goldfish. We
 have a television, a computer and a   
 piano. We use the room for assembly   
 and to eat our lunch. In the Infant   
 room we have a book corner, play area 
 with dressing up clothes and lots of  
 constructional toys.                  
  We have a big activity room for      
 painting and making things. We have an
 entrance hall with a music table where
 we can play percussion instruments.   
 Some of us play the recorder. We have 
 three small cloakrooms for our coats. 
 We have an office.                    </content>
