		<title>11Education in Bassenthwaite</title>
		<content> In Bassenthwaite village there was a  
 Dame School which was in Willow       
 Cottage. The present church room was  
 originally the first parish school in 
 Bassenthwaite,and in 1874 the average 
 number of pupils was 44. That school  
 closed on 18 Dec 1874, and everything 
 was moved to Bassenthwaite Board      
 School, just over a hundred metres    
 away. It opened on 16 Jan 1875.       
 Attendance was 75 children. Due to    
 weather conditions the attendance     
 sometimes fell by half. 1918 and 1919 
 the school was closed for 9 weeks     
 because of an flu epidemic. In 1939   
 there were 97 pupils, 59 from Bassen_ 
 thwaite and 38 evacuees. In 1941,     
 snowstorms closed the school. In 1985 
 there are 20 children and 1.3 teachers
 . There is 1 big classroom and 1 small
 where the children work. There are    
 toilets and a canteen across a yard.  </content>
