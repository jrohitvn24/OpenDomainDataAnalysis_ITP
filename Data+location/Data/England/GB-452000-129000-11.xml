		<content> Mentioned must be made of the{GOSPEL  
{OAK}in Hampage Wood. This wood is     
 approached by a number of well        
 sign-posted bridleways - a pleasant   
 change from where footpaths have been 
 obliterated by farmers! Hampage Wood  
 was where much of the timber was      
 obtained for the building of          
 Winchester Cathedral in 1079.         
 According to the "{Victoria County    
{History" }                            
 "Bishop Walkelin ...asked William the 
 Conqueror for the gift of as much     
 timber as he could carry away from    
 Hampage Wood in four days ans nights. 
 the King consented,and the            
 bishop,having collected all the       
 woodmen from the surrounding country, 
 managed to clear the wood with the    
 exception of one tree under which     
 St.Augustine was said to have         
 preached."                            </content>
