		<content>      There are six parallel mounds.The
 first mound consists of earth covered 
 with grass.The soldiers used to lie on
 this to fire at the targets.The next  
 three parallel mounds were also fired 
 from but the soldiers climbed steps up
 an earth bank into the brick bunkers  
 which had wooden covers.The last      
 firing mound is approached by a wide  
 slope and is closest to the targets.  
 The target bank consists of earth and 
 stone. Within the bank is a curved    
 brick wall which forms a shelter with 
 seats for the men operating the       
 targets. The paper targets were wound 
 up on steel frames. The pulleys and   
 winches are still there. The last     
 mound is formed by a three-sided red  
 brick wall enclosing earth and sand to
 slow the impact of the bullets. Many  
 bullets are still embedded here or    
 just lying on the soil.               </content>
