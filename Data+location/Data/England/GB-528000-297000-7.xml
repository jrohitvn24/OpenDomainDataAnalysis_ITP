		<content>    Coates Methodist Chapel is situated
 on North Green. We could not find out 
 when it was built,but,according to a  
 carving in a stone above the lamp over
 the front door it was enlarged in     
 1866.                                 
    Services are held each Sunday at   
 6.30 p.m. The minister is the Reverend
 J.Staples,who lives at 7,Portland     
 Place,Whittlesey. The chapel has an   
 organ. There is a Sunday School       
 room,but no Sunday School.            
    There is also a Methodist Chapel in
 Eastrea. This chapel has a Sunday     
 School which is held at 10 a.m. The   
 teacher's name is Mr.Hall. Sometimes  
 we go into the school and sometimes   
 into the chapel. There is a service   
 every Sunday afternoon,taken by dif-  
 ferent person each Sunday,as the chap-
 el has no permanent minister.
