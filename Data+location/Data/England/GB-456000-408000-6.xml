		<content>  The centre usually has about twenty  
 two  horses, but the number varies    
 from week to week.{Cheyenne}was the   
 first horse we saw.{Cheyenne}is a     
 skewbald who is 15 hands high,and is  
 one of the centre's own horses.{Ben}is
 another horse like{Cheyenne}because he
 is light brown and white.He is blind  
 in one eye, but is still ridden       
 regularly because he can see very well
 with the other one.Two horses called  
{Queenie}and {Lucinda }are relations of
 the {Queen's}Cleveland bay stallion.{ 
{Queenie}is 16.1 hands high and        
{Lucinda},the proprietress's own horse,
 is 15.3 hands high.{Mister}who is 17  
 years old is a strawberry roan pony   
 and is 14.1 hands.{Dusty}who is a grey
 pony had a cough, so he could only be 
 ridden for half an hour a day.
