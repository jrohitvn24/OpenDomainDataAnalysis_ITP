		<content> HOT RICE. To play Hot Rice you need a 
 ball and six or more children.Everyone
 stands in a circle and anyone may     
 bounce the ball into the middle saying
 "H.O.T.R.I.C.E. spells Hot Rice". When
 hot rice is shouted,the person with   
 the ball bounces it every time a      
 letter or word is spoken.They then    
 bounce it once more into the middle   
 and then the ball has to roll under   
 someone's legs.The person whose legs  
 it rolls under is 'on'.The other      
 players have to run and the one who is
 on runs and shouts,"Stop!Hot Rice!"   
 Then the ball is thrown.If it hits a  
 player they are out.This continues    
 until everyone is out.Then the game   
 starts again.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
