 Our church is about 200 yards down the
 road from our school. It dates back to
 the Norman times because a Norman arch
 was found above the entrance there.   
 There is are two shields, one shield  
 has a pair of sheep shears. There is  
 a church clock facing North. There are
 some very old yew trees, there are    
 seven of them and they are shaped in  
 cones. In the churchyard there are    
 plenty of table vaults, Joseph        
 Alexander Horlick's family vault is   
 there, he was the man who invented the
 drink. You can open that vault and go 
 exploring. There are graves dating    
 back to the 1600s. The vicar has a    
 cloak for special occasions with gold 
 thread. The church is a C. of E.,and  
 can seat a congregation of about      
 80,having been enlarged in 1926.
