		<content>{Bob Shanks,}our eldest inhabitant at  
 89, lives at Coal Houses. He remembers
 fighting in World War I when, after   
 having been no further than Newcastle,
 he was suddenly sent to Hong Kong with
 the Royal Garrison Artillery.         
{Ethel Thompson}has lived in the area  
 all her life. She is 74 years old, a  
 widow, and lives alone at Cherry Tree 
 Cottage. When it is fine she spends a 
 lot of time gardening and during the  
 dark evenings she enjoys needlecraft, 
 and watching T.V. Ethel would like to 
 see an improved bus service for the   
 village and less low-flying aircraft. 
{Jim Dibble}is a retired London head-  
 teacher who came, with his wife Ruth, 
 to Inglenook to live. He enjoys       
 walking on the hills of his native    
 Northumberland and is learning to play
 the Northumbrian pipes. Jim wishes the
 weather up here was a bit warmer.     </content>
