		<title>10BASILDON NE: AFTER SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I am ten years old. When I get home   
 from school I have a drink and then I 
 get on my bike and go round my        
 friend's house.                       
 We usually go up the park and play on 
 the swings. When we are really going  
 high we jump off. Sometimes we play a 
 game of chasing when we have to stay  
 off the ground by moving across the   
 climbing frames and swings and things.
 After, I go home and play games on the
 computer or write programs for it.    
 Sometimes I play with my sisters. On  
 Mondays I usually go out to Girl      
 Guides.                               
 On Saturdays and Sundays I go and     
 visit my father. We used to do lots of
 things together but now he has a new  
 girl-friend we don't do so much.      
 Mainly we just go up to his club and I
 sit around while they have a drink.   
 Other than that I don't do much.      </content>
