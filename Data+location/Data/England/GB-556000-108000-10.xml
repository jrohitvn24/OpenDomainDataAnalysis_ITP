		<title>10CYCLING SAFETY IN HAILSHAM</title>
		<content>   The main reason for cycling         
 proficiency in school is to teach 11  
 year old children how to be safe on   
 the road. There are 2 tests after 5   
 weekly lessons, a written test and a  
 test where a road safety officer      
 watches the children riding their     
 bicycles. The training is done on the 
 playground.                           
   The ladies who help are all         
 volunteers. Cyclists learn to ride    
 with the ball of their foot on the    
 pedal. They have to do the following:-
 left hand turn, right hand turn, an   
 emergency stop and cycling around     
 obstacles. They have to learn always  
 to be careful on the road.            
   About a week after they start       
 training a policeman comes to check   
 that their bicycles are roadworthy.
