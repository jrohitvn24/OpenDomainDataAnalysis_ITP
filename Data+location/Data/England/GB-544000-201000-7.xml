		<title>07EPPING CHURCH'S PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> St.John's,the{parish church}in Epping,
 has to do more,with less money,in     
 1985.It costs {Â£70 }a day to run the  
 church.Until recently,homeless people 
 were able to sleep in the church      
 porch, but vandals throwing stones and
 kicking sleepers forced the porch to  
 be closed at night.However, the church
 is open daily and the vicar is always 
 ready to{listen to,help,and understand
 many people who come with problems.He 
 feels that young people today lack    
 discipline.Non church-goers take its  
 facilities for granted,and requests to
 be married and baptised are expected  
 to be immediately welcomed and        
 granted.The greatest{challenge}in     
 1985 for the building is the  north-  
 facing side of the{roof,}which is     
 leaking and badly needs repairs       
 costing{Â£40,000.}Major fund-raising   
 plans are in operation.               </content>
