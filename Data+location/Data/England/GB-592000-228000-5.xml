		<content> For each of the past twenty years     
 Fordham has had a  village fete. The  
 money that is raised is divided       
 equally between the{church}and the    
{village}hall.The preparations for the 
 fete begin the previous October.      
 Anyone who is willing and interested  
 may join the committee. The first     
 thing to be decided is the date of the
 fete. When the date has been settled  
 decisions are taken as to the stalls. 
 Then the main attractions are         
 discussed and this year crane rides   
 and an army display team were chosen. 
 Raffle  prizes have to be bought or   
 donated and the main prize chosen.    
 This year it was binoculars. In the   
 preceding months extra ideas are      
 discussed and added to the programme. 
 The stalls are erected on the morning 
 of the fete.This years fete raised
