		<title>02DARTMOOR PONIES</title>
		<content> The earliest mention of Dartmoor      
 Ponies was in the will of a Saxon     
 Bishop in 1012. Ponies have been      
 used on the moor for centuries to pull
 carts and tend stock. They were ideal 
 beasts for transporting mined tin ore 
 to the stannary towns. During the     
 first world war Shetland and Dartmoor 
 ponies were interbred to produce      
 crosses small enough to go down mines 
 as pit-ponies. There are few pure     
 Dartmoor ponies today. In the         
 summer there may be up to 2500 ponies 
 on the moor. In the autumn they are   
 rounded up and surplus ponies are     
 auctioned off, many for slaughter as  
 pet food. They are in danger from     
 broken glass, plastic bags and rusty  
 tins left by picnickers. Ponies may be
 seen all over the moor. Fencing and   
 cattle grids prevent them from roaming
 off the moor.                         </content>
