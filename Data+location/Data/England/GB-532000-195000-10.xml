		<title>10Playground Games, Enfield</title>
		<content> The most popular games we play in the 
 playground are football, handstands,  
 skipping, leapfrog &amp; block. These were
 played by our parents &amp; grandparents.{
 Block is a game where you have to     
 reach a post without being caught. One
 person is "It" &amp; has to count up to   
 100 with their eyes closed. Meanwhile 
 everyone has to hide. Soon the person 
 who is "It" turns round. The people   
 who are hiding now have to get back to
 the post without being pointed at &amp;   
 caught. If you are the first caught   
 you will be "It" next unless someone  
 frees you by saying "Release the      
 lock". Our parents called this by     
 different names such as Lucky, Hideout
 &amp; Tin Can Tommy. Some playground games
 have died out, e.g. Whip &amp; Top,       
 Hopscotch &amp; Kiss Chase, this is banned
 here. Seasonal games we play are      
 conkers, sliding &amp; snowballs.         </content>
