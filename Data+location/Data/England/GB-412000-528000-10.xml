		<title>10SOCIAL LIFE IN THIS AREA</title>
		<content> destroyed the flora, fauna and topo-  
 graphy of the area.  The appearance of
 the land surrounding the village      
 became unfamiliar.  Not only well-    
 loved faces had gone.  Now well-known 
 landmarks, building and childhood     
 haunts had disappeared forever.       
 Mothers sought work outside the home. 
 This led to increased wealth, but it  
 was responsible for an change in the  
 upbringing of families.  Television   
 and video curtailed family conver-    
 sation.  Supermarkets affected the    
 trade of local shopkeepers, and the   
 possession of family cars or money  to
 hire taxis was to influence local bus 
 services in the revision of time-     
 tables.  Three chapels and a church   
 have survived, and a handful of the   
 original villagers remain, but most of
 them now lie at rest in the churchyard
 of St. Cuthbert, Etherley.            </content>
