		<title>04The Basingstoke Canal.</title>
		<content>   Part of the Basingstoke Canal runs  
 through the village. It is approx 200 
 years old. It was  37 miles long and  
 joins the River Wey at New Haw. At    
 first it carried agricultural produce 
 from Hampshire to London, particularly
 wheat, flour and timber. In return    
 coal and manufactured goods were      
 brought from London. Bricks were also 
 carried for local buildings, in       
 particular St. Mary's Church, The     
 Victoria Hall and for the building of 
 the Barracks in Aldershot. Wharf Road 
 takes its name from the wharf on the  
 canal, where there was a Boat yard.   
 The canal fell into disuse after the  
 2nd World War and was bought by Surrey
 and Hampshire County Councils in the  
 l960's. Since l980 it has been under  
 active restoration. It is now 90%     
 restored and is part of the leisure   
 facilities of the area.               </content>
