		<title>02A brief history of Elton</title>
		<content> Elton, or "Athelniton" as it was known
 in Norman times was originally a Saxon
 village, before being taken over by a 
 Danish Lord of the Manor after the    
 invasions of the ninth and tenth      
 centuries.In 1025 it passed to the    
 Bishop of Dorchester after a wager    
 with the Lord of the Manor and        
 eventually the Crown.The Manor was    
 bought about 1602 by the Proby family,
 who still live at Elton Hall. The     
 population has been fairly stable, but
 with declining numbers in this        
 century: 664 in 1792, 738 in 1831 and 
 560 in 1984.However,the beginnings of 
 new expansion are apparent in the     
 building of a new estate on the north 
 west side of the village.A recent     
 survey by pupils from Elton school    
 found that there were 52 houses built 
 before 1800, 32 between 1800 and 1945 
 and 128 since then.                   </content>
