		<title>18Caravan Club At Notgrove</title>
		<content> Just off the A436 is a secluded,      
 private Holiday Caravan Club Site. It 
 can accommodate up to 60 vans at a    
 time. There are showers, toilets and a
 hook-up electric point,as well as an  
 on site shop. It is housed on the site
 of the now dismantled Notgrove railway
 station, and is screened from the road
 by trees.                             
                                       
 The nearest hospital is Bourton-on-the
 Water 6km away, as is the dentist and 
 also the doctors surgery. The doctors 
 are good and will visit at home if the
 patients find it difficult to reach   
 the surgery. The nearest ambulance is 
 8km away at Northleach as is the      
 nearest fire station.
