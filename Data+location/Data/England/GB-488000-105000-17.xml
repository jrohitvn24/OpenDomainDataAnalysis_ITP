    village.  Vandalism.               
                                       
 There are approx. 1200 residents in   
 Tangmere. The majority of the peaople 
 in full time employment do not work in
 the village. Many travel to           
 Chichester, Portsmouth and Worthing,  
 this is relatively easy because of the
 close proximity of the A27 trunk road.
 Those remaining are employed in a     
 variety of occupations. Builders,     
 Painters, Carpenters,mechanics (contd)</content>
