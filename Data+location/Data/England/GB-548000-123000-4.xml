 My family includes my parents,two     
 elder brothers and me. We live in Five
 Ashes but prefer to use Buxted School.

 and Mum helps at Pound Green Stores.  
 We will go to Secondary School at     
 Heathfield.                           
 My family has lived in the area for   
 three generations and all came to this
 school. My father is a mobile washing 
 machine engineer and Mum and sister   
 work part time in the village .       
 My Mum                                
 There are four in our family.We ame   
 down to Buxted last year from         
 Scotland.My dad is an airline pilot   
 based at Gatwick Airport.I don't like 
 moving as it takes a long time to make
 friends.
