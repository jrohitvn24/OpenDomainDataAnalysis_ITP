		<title>02Hawkinge Aerodrome</title>
		<content> There is a former aerodrome close to  
 the village. The site is now          
 agricultural land but there are plans 
 to reopen the airfield for light      
 planes.                               
    The aerodrome was in use from 1910 
 to 1961. During World War 1 the site  
 was used by the Royal Flying Corps to 
 ferry aircraft to St.Omer for service 
 at the front.                         
     Hawkinge Aerodrome became famous  
 during World War 2 as a front line    
 station. The squadrons from Hawkinge  
 were closely involved in the Battle of
 Britain. the main aircraft used at    
 that time were Spitfires and          
 Hurricanes.                           
     The former RAF camp is now a      
 residential housing estate. The       
 gymnasium is a hall used for community
 social functions.
