		<title>13Ravenfield Park. (Old Hall)</title>
		<content>{Ravenfield Hall,}now burnt down, was  
 built by the ancient family of{Westby 
 in the{17th century.}The park was     
 enclosed at the same time. In the 2nd 
 half of the 18th century,{Elizabeth   
{Parkin and Walter Oborne,}successors  
 to Westby built a{new church, enlarged
 the{hall}and park and added a new     
{stable. John Carr}was the architect.  
 The park contained fish ponds of      
 unknown origin, good trees and a herd 
 of deer. In{1920 the hall}and park was
 sold, the estate broken up and decay  
 set in. It was{abandoned}in{1930.     
 During the{2nd world war}the{army}used
 the park as a training ground.        
{Prisoners of war}were held there      
 later. In{1945,}Mr Heath bought the   
 land for{farming.}In 1972 Mr Heath's  
 son sold the pond part of the park to 
 the{Phoenix and Aldwarke Social       
{Service club}of B.Steel Rotherham.    </content>
