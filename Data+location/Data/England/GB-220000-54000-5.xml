		<content>  The school was all age(5-14).Children
 had to walk up to 3mls. each way.Wet  
 clothes were dried around the         
 classrooms' coke stoves. Dinners      
 (often pasties) were eaten in houses  
 in the village.Discipline was strict  
 and corporal punishment frequently    
 used.Attendance was good except for   
 busy times in the farming year-hay    
 making,harvesting etc. when  many boys
 were absent.A few farmers sons        
 attended private schools.             
  Childrens games.A rich variety.      
 The most popular were marbles,conkers,
 whip &amp; tops,hoops and 'fag cards'.Hare
 and hounds was the favourite outdoors.
  Courtship.A strong tendency for      
 marriages to take place between       
 couples in the parish -'foreigners'   
 very unwelcome and handled roughly.   
 Bicycles and motor bikes have changed 
 this as young men went further afield.</content>
