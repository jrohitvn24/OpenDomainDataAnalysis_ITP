		<title>02A FAMILY BEEF FARM</title>
		<content> This is a 250 acre beef farm, breeding
 just Charolais cattle. Meadow Mell    
 Farm is covered by grassland with     
 buildings at the side nearest the A336
 road. One building is for keeping     
 machinery including tractors, bailer  
 and a bulldozer. These are all the    
 property of the Coombes family who    
 also own the farm.                    
 In view of high costs and other       
 expenses involved no outside labour is
 employed and the farm can easily be   
 managed by the members of the same    
 family. This is evident as all the    
 machinery is modern thereby avoiding  
 the need to employ extra men to work  
 on the farm.                          
 Additional income is made from selling
 the 100 tonnes of cow dung produced   
 every year by the farm stock of cows.
