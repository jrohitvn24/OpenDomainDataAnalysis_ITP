		<content>      I am Paul and I enjoy living in  
 the country. One of my hobbies is     
 gardening. I have a little patch of my
 own and I am growing vegetables in it.
      I like going fishing for one of  
 my hobbies. Once I caught a trout. I  
 took it home and cooked it for my tea.
      When my dad comes home I help him
 feed our two goats. I keep them in a  
 little pen. We wouldn't be able to    
 keep goats in a town because they     
 smell too much.                       
      Ducks come on the stream at the  
 bottom of our garden and we feed them 
 with left-over bread.                 
      Because I live in the country my 
 mum drives me to cubs and dad picks me
 up again. I have to go to school by   
 car as well.                          
      I like the country at night      
 because it is very quiet, but I watch 
 a lot of television.                  </content>
