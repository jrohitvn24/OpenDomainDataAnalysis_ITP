 The sawmill in Sampford Arundel has   
 got 45 workers.  It is a medium-sized 
 sawmill and it is very useful for     
 Sampford Arundel. At the sawmill they 
 divide all the workers into groups.   
 This is what the groups do: one group 
 stacks the timber, another group cuts 
 the timber, and some people would     
 plane the timber.                     
{Haywain Inn}                          
 To start with the inn was called The  
 Red Ball Inn but 7 years ago it       
 changed its name to The Haywain Inn.  
 At the inn there are five people      
 working.  It is busy during the week  
 but it is especially busy at weekends.
 The inn opens at 11 a.m. and closes at
 2.30 p.m. Then the workers have a     
 break, and it opens again at 5.30     
 p.m.and closes again at 11 p.m.
