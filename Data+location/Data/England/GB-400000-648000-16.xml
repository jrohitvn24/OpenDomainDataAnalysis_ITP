		<content>{Children's Games:}One of our favourite
 games is playing on a bike,playing    
 scrambling,going through the mud and  
 falling off without getting hurt.     
{BMX bikes }are great fun, especially  
 doing wheelies. This means riding on  
 one wheel only with the handlebars up 
 in the air.Playing on {RollerSkates}is
 also good fun as you can move around  
 very quickly.                         
   {Hidey-bo-Seek}is another game we   
 like to play. One person is on and the
 rest have to hide and the one who is  
 found has to run back to the bay      
 without being tagged and              
 say"free,one,two, three" and then they
 cannot be on. Scarper is a similar    
 type of game.                         
     Indoors we like to play board     
 games like {Cuckoo Nest, Packman,BMX  
{Challenge,}dial games like{Turbo}and  
{Computer Type}games like {Star Force. </content>
