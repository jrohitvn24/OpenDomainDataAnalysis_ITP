		<title>01THE PRESTON AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered is rural and contains
 2 small villages and several hamlets. 
 Much of the land belongs to 2 large   
 estates,the Pilkington estate and the 
 Bowes Lyon estate.There are several   
 farms,mainly arable but with some     
 dairy cattle and a few sheep.There are
 many wooded areas and this provides   
 cover for the pheasants which are     
 reared locally for the shooting season
 There are no large rivers,just the    
 source of the R.Mimram to the far     
 south and there are few hills to climb
 The landscape is gently undulating and
 very peaceful and pleasant.Only lanes 
 and country roads cross the area and  
 there are just 3 pubs, 4 churches and 
 1 shop.People travel to nearby Hitchin
 or Stevenage to shop and work and many
 residents commute to London each day. 
 The total population is a few hundred.
