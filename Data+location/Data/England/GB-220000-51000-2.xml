		<title>02INDUSTRY:BOATS AND FISHING</title>
		<content> When we visited the quays at Looe,We  
 discovered that the main fishing      
 method is trawling.There are two      
 middle-water trawlers and twenty-seven
 near-water trawlers.Some trawlers fish
 in pairs towing a net between them.   
 They fly a red white and blue flag    
 when they are doing this.The boats are
 mostly modern stern-trawlers which    
 cost a lot to buy.We were told that   
 even a second-hand boat can cost      
 Â£50,000.Some boats were built at      
 Morval,near Looe.Others were built at 
 Penryn and at other places in Great   
 Britain,such as Scotland.Nets are     
 expensive and are sometimes lost.They 
 cost Â£800-Â£1000.The trawlers have a   
 crew of two or three men.They stay out
 for a day to two days before landing  
 their catch.There is a fish-packing   
 station with six packers.Most of the  
 fish goes to Plymouth market.(see P.3)</content>
