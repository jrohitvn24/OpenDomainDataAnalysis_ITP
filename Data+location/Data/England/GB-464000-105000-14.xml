  At Worlds End bore holes are sunk to 
 a depth of 250 feet to obtain water.  
 The water is then treated with a small
 quantity of chlorine and then pumped  
 to the George Reservoir. The Reservoir
 was built in 1952 and was constructed 
 of reinforced concrete and is hidden  
 under a grassy mound on the top of    
 Portsdown Hill. It has a depth of 20.5
 feet, holds 2 million gallons of water
 and feeds Cosham, Waterlooville, and  
 Purbrook. It is amazing that you      
 cannot even see the George Reservoir  
 exists - the mound looks so natural.
