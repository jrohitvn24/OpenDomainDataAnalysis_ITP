		<title>09THORPE'S VILLAGE GREENS</title>
		<content> ACROSS THE ROAD FROM MORLEY COTTAGE,  
 WHERE THE TENDRING ROAD MEETS         
 COLCHESTER ROAD, IS AN OPEN SPACE     
 CALLED FIRST GREEN. IT HAS            
 APPROXIMATELY 15 TREES AND THE GRASS  
 IS CUT FAIRLY REGULARLY SO THAT PEOPLE
 CAN HAVE PICNICS THERE AND CHILDREN   
 CAN PLAY. ABOUT HALF A MILE DOWN THE  
 ROAD TOWARDS COLCHESTER THERE'S SECOND
 GREEN WHICH IS AT THE JUNCTION OF     
 WHITEHALL LANE. IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN
 FIRST GREEN AND HAS ABOUT 20 TREES AND
 3 PONDS, 2 OF WHICH ARE MEDIUM SIZED  
 AND THE THIRD SMALLER. WHEN IT RAINS  
 HEAVILY BOTH GREENS BECOME WATERLOGGED
 AND IT TAKES 2 TO 4 DAYS FOR THEM TO  
 DRY OUT. BOTH GREENS ARE PUBLIC OPEN  
 SPACES BUT ARE NOT USED VERY MUCH     
 BECAUSE THEY ARE A LONG WAY FROM THE  
 CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE.
