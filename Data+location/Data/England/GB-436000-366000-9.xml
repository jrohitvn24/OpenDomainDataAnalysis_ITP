		<title>09ALL SAINTS WINGERWORTH</title>
		<content>   The{Church of England} has All      
 Saints Church in Wingerworth.  It has 
 a building of several distinct parts, 
 still having some of the original     
 Norman building, the 1783 mausolem and
 the 1963 extension.                   
   We talked to the rector, Reverend   
 Millington.  He works 10 hours a day  
 and only has Saturday off, unless     
 there is a wedding, but he still likes
 his job.                              
   He takes on average 4 services a    
 week, usually 300 people attend on    
 Sunday.  His most important service is
 Holy Communion.                       
   There are a number of church groups 
 which members of the community can    
 join, ie.{Mothers Union, Sunday       
{School, Young Wives. }The {Scouts}and 
{Guides}are also linked to the church.
