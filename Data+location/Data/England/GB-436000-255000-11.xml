		<content> On Friday afternoons I go to{wind band
 in the school. Two parents come in,   
 Mrs. Payne and Mrs. Castro, and teach 
 us many different pieces of{music.}   
 There are about fifteen of us, all    
 middle school pupils.  We meet in the 
 school hall, after afternoon play and 
 practice right through to 3.3O p.m.,  
 the end of school.  The main          
 instruments are{flutes, clarinets,    
{recorders.} We don't play classical   
 music, just well known pieces.        
  Sometimes we go to Southam, our local
 town, to play to the blind or disabled
 people.    We also perform in our     
 school plays.                         
  Most of us who come to wind band have
 another music lesson with a lady      
 called Mrs. Morris who teaches us new 
 notes, timing as well as improving our
 technique.  I practice at weekends,   
 its hard work, but its for fun.       </content>
