		<title>10VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>  I live in Thorne Coffin which is a   
 medium sized village just outside the 
 town of Yeovil.I go to Westfield      
 Comprehensive which is in             
 Yeovil.Thorne Coffin is mainly made up
 of farmhouses and cottages.The biggest
 house in the village is Thorne House  
 which is Westland's guest house.There 
 are three derilict houses next to     
 Thorne cottage.These are owned by Mrs 
 Elizabeth Gillett.Mrs Gillett is one  
 of the main landowners in Thorne.There
 is one church_St.Andrews.There are no 
 pubs,shops or post offices in         
 Thorne.There is a village hall in     
 Thorne but it is not used very often  
 as it is slightly run_down.
