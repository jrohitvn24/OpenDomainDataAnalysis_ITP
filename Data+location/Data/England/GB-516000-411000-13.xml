		<content> I found out what children did in their
 spare time.Boys were Riding their BMX 
 bikes,Watching television,Playing     
 Transformers and Comic reading.       
 Transformers are toys which change    
 into two things.One thing is a robot  
 with weapons while the other thing    
 could be a plane,cassette, lorry,car  
 or even an insect.Marvel has published
 a comic called The Transformers with a
 Transformer story in it.Children get  
 the comic and then they make their    
 toys fight battles like the story in  
 the comic.They have replaced the Star 
 Wars toys that we all played with a   
 couple of years ago.Comic reading is  
 still popular with boys the favorite  
 comic being "The Transformers."Girls  
 enjoy Riding their bikes,Watching     
 television,Sewing and Horse riding    
 with several girls owning their own   
 horses.                               </content>
