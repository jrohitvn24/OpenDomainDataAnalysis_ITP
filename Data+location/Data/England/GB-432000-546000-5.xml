		<title>05EPPLETON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      Our new open-plan school is the  
 third{Eppleton school.                
      The first, Eppleton Council      
 school, opened in 1872, and was       
 enlarged in 1890. This was replaced in
 1928 by Eppleton Colliery County      
 Junior Mixed, Infants and Senior      
 Schools; over a thousand children were
 in this school at any one time.       
      Falling numbers and the building 
 of new secondary schools meant that a 
 smaller,{purpose-built school}was     
 needed.                               
      Building began in June 1984, and 
 the school opened for use in April    
 1985. It is carpeted right through and
 there is superb equipment for nearly  
 three hundred pupils.                 
      A well-equipped{community centre 
 is attached to the school.
