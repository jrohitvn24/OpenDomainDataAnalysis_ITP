		<title>12  GILLING WEST VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Most of the houses in Gilling are made
 of greyish coloured bricks but some of
 them are made of stone.The very old   
 buildings are stone and the newer     
 buildings are mostly made of bricks.  
 Most of the roofs are made of slate.  
                                       
 As you  walk through the village you  
 will see the school,built in 1847.    
 Further along,there is Town End Farm  
 which has unusual arched windows.Past 
 the farm there is the Church.Some of  
 it was built in the eleventh century. 
 There is also a Village Hall where    
 several activities take place.        
                                       
 There is one shop in Gilling. It is a 
 Post Office as well as a General Store
 and  sells most things. A baker's van 
 calls  every Friday night, a butcher's
 van on  Wednesday &amp; Friday afternoons 
 and a fish van on Friday mornings.    </content>
