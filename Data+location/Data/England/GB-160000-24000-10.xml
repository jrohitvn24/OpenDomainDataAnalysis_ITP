		<title>10SAINT PETERSTIDE</title>
		<content>    Saint Peter is the patron saint of 
 fishermen and Porthleven is a fishing 
 village so one of the notable events  
 in Porthleven is Saint Peterstide     
 which takes place on the Saturday     
 nearest to the 29th June. People from 
 the village churches gather at one of 
 the churches. Then led by a band they 
 march around the village. They finish 
 at the football field where the Sunday
 School teachers give out saffron buns 
 and there are races and games. Prizes 
 for the little ones are toys and the  
 older ones get money. Across the road 
 from the football field is a car park 
 where the fair is. Anybody can join in
 the walk around the village whether   
 they go to church or not.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
