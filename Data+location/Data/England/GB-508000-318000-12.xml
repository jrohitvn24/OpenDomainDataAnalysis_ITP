		<title>12THE CASTLE SITE, BOURNE</title>
		<content> The hill around the castle is supposed
 to be where they made a tunnel either 
 to the{Red Hall}or{Abbey Church.} The 
 Bourne Eau gave the water supply to   
 the castle as also did St. Peter's    
 Pool. The{Wellhead}Cottage is now     
 owned by the{United Charities.} It is 
 supposed to have been built from the  
 stones of the old castle. {The Darby  
{and Joan Hall}was built in 1959 and is
 now used for keep-fit classes, for old
 people to enjoy themselves and a      
 meeting place for disabled people.    
 Some nights meetings are also held in 
 the hall.                             
 Although not Bourne's oldest building,
 Wellhead Cottage is very interesting. 
 It was once known as Castle Farm.
