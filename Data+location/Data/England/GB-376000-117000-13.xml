		<content>  The MARNHULL BRITISH LEGION began in 
 1921.It has about 300 members,mostly  
 male.Anyone who has served in the     
 Forces can be a member,but as there   
 has not been a major war for sometime,
 membership has been extended.The Poppy
 Appeal and Remembrance Day are the    
 highlights of the year.There is always
 a large church parade with Shaftesbury
 Silver Band.                          
  The Legion Club has an old hut that  
 has been converted by its members into
 a clubroom.Here Bingo is played every 
 Tuesday.The Club has a bar with a Pool
 table and table skittles.It also runs 
 a darts team.                         
  JUDO is held every Monday for boys   
 and girls at St. Mary's RC School.It  
 is very well attended.Children work to
 gain belts of different colours which 
 signify progress.
