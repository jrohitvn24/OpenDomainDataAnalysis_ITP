		<title>04FARM IRRIGATION.</title>
		<content>   One of the biggest headaches for the
 farmer is the weather; rainfall, or   
 the lack of it.                       
   Lower Mount Farm has a licence to   
 abstract water from the land for      
 irrigation purposes. The water is     
 obtained from a bore hole to the      
 north-west of the farm buildings, and 
 is bought to the surface by an        
 electric pump. Hose reel irrigation   
 machines are then used to irrigate the
 soft fruits and potatoes.             
   The farmland also carries water     
 pipes, which run from a pumping       
 station to the reservoir, which in    
 turn supplies the surrounding         
 residential area with water. These    
 pipes are covered by mounds of        
 earth, as the surrounding land has    
 been lowered due to gravel extraction.
