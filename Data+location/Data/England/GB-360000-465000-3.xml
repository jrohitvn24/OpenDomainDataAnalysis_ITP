		<content> Wray Endowed County Primary School is 
 300 years old. At present, there are  
 thirty-six children in the school, and
 two teachers. It has two large        
 classrooms which look out on to the   
 surrounding countryside. The walls are
 bright with project work. Infants,    
 aged between four and seven, are      
 started off on their reading and      
 writing and they learn lots of things 
 through play. The junior children work
 upstairs and their curriculum includes
 science, history, geography, English, 
 art, craft, drama and mathematics.    
 There is also a computer which is in  
 regular use.                          
 It is in an area which takes the 11+  
 test. This enables some children to go
 to the Grammar Schools in Lancaster.  
 Others go to secondary schools in     
 Lancaster, Hornby, or Kirkby Lonsdale.
