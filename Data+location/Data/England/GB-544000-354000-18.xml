		<content> The school has 115 children on roll   
 and a staff (including the Head) of   
 4.2. There are 2 junior classes and 2 
 infant classes.The curriculum is much 
 wider and relevant than in the past   
 with science and computers given more 
 emphasis. There is a wide variety of  
 teaching methods and approaches-      
 groups or individuals may be working  
 on different topics at any given time 
 as well as the class working together.
 This requires careful planning and    
 monitoring. There is a very friendly  
 and co-operative atmosphere between   
 the staff, children, governors and    
 parents .Widening the curriculum,     
 making it more relevant, using modern 
 teaching methods and ideas is         
 desirable but difficult with no extra 
 resources. There needs to be balance, 
 if the basic tools of education, the 3
 R's are not to suffer.                </content>
