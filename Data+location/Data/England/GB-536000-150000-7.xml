 snack bar,  &amp; on the next 2 floors up,
 are bedrooms. The  R.A.C  &amp;  the  A.A.
 have appointed it as a 2 star hotel.  
  When you go in you see: a saloon bar,
 restaurant  &amp;  2 different bars .  The
 building isn't very attractive &amp; looks
 rather like a big water tank !{    THE

 Hill is the only other hotel in Oxted.
   Outside Oxted there are some other  
 pubs like{ THE HAYCUTTER} in  Broadham
