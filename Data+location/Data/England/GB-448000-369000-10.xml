		<title>10THE MODERN WATER SUPPLY.</title>
		<content>      When it was discovered that a    
 bore hole supplying Whaley Water Works
 had become polluted it became         
 necessary to find an alternate source.
 As a temporary measure water was drawn
 from Manton Colliery and purified at  
 Whaley before being distributed as    
 before.                               
      Work was planned to lay a        
 pipe-line to carry water from Ogston  
 Reservoir to the city of Sheffield. It
 was decided to put in a spur from the 
 pipe-line at Calow which would bring  
 water from Ogston to supply the       
 Bolsover area.                        
      After this work was completed the
 Whaley Water Works was closed.        
 Although no longer in use the         
 buildings and purification equipment  
 remain.
