		<title>13SHOPPING &amp; TRAVELLING</title>
		<content> During July 1985, a number of people  
 at Carclaze were asked about their    
 shopping and travelling habits.       
                                       
 Most people said they did their main  
 shoping in St. Austell, buying their  
 week's provisions in one trip. They   
 used the local shops in Carclaze if   
 they ran out of small items and went  
 to Plymouth for major items, such as  
 suits, new dresses and Christmas      
 presents.                             
                                       
 Although over half the people surveyed
 travelled to work by car, many used   
 the public transport system regularly.
 Several said that the local mini-bus  
 service was good and would like to see
 it extended. Many people used the     
 train service from St.Austell for long
 journeys.                             
                                       </content>
