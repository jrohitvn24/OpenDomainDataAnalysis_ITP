 Bosbury C.C. was re-formed in 1981    
 after a long interval.In 1985 it has  
 30 playing members 17 vice presidents,
 and 10 committee members.The president
 is Mr.T.S.Hone, chairman Mr.C.Minton  
 and secretary Mr.W.Rees. The previous 
 cricket club originally played on the 
 ground that was taken over to build   
 the school. This became the school    
 playing field. The re-formed cricket  
 club now uses this  playing  field as 
 its ground . They raise  funds to     
 provide money for equipment,          
 re_seeding the square and hopefully   
 rebuild the old pavilion. The club    
 entered the Hereford and District     
 league in 1982 in division 6 and      
 gained promotion to division 5 in its 
 first year in division 4. They also   
 field  a team of under 16s to compete </content>
