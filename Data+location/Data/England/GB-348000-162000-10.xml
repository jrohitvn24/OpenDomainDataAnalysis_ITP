		<content> There are no schools in the area and  
 so all children have to travel,several
 going to private schools,mostly in    
 Bristol.Children from Winford parish  
 attend Felton or Winford primary      
 schools and Chew Valley comprehensive,
 the others go to Wrington primary and 
 Churchill comprehensive.              
   Up to 1984 Redhill had a primary    
 school,but this closed because of low 
 numbers.Pupils there were given free  
 transport to Wrington school(nearly 2 
 miles away),but this was not promised 
 for Redhill children under school age.
   Parents of pupils starting school in
 1985 were told that they would have to
 pay for this transport.The parents    
 thought that this was unfair as others
 at Wrington had free transport on road
 safety grounds.Avon Education cttee   
 agree that the road is dangerous,but  
 still will not provide free transport.</content>
