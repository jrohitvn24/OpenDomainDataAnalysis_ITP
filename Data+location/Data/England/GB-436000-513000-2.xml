		<content>     Farming is the key industry in the
 Northern part of the survey area.Some 
 of the farmers {own the land}and have 
 farmed here for eg 24,45,101 and 140  
 years, whilst others are tenants.     
     The majority of farms which have  
 made{changes}during the last 10 years 
 have reduced livestock numbers and    
 increased the amounts of cereals and  
 oil seed rape grown. The reason for   
 this has been that arable farming is  
 more profitable and requires less     
 labour. The European Economic         
 Community also provides{subsidies}for 
 farmers growing certain crops, for    
 example ,oil seed rape, which is sold 
 to make margarine.                    
     More{grassland}does occur towards 
 the West, away from urban Teesside,   
 and also around the areas of land     
 close to the airport's runways.
