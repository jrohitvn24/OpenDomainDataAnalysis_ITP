		<content>  This is a school for slow-learning   
 children of Oxfordshire. It is a      
 weekly boarding school for 80 boys and
 girls between the ages of 7 - 16      
 years.There are 10 teaching staff     
 including the Head and two classroom  
 assistants.  The Headmaster lives on  
 the premises, but other staff travel  
 in daily. There are seven houseparents
 who live in during the week. The      
 part-time domestic staff come in from 
 Islip and have to rely on their own   
 transport.                            
  The building was used by the BBC     
 during the 1939-45 war, but has been a
 school since about 1949.              
  The annual fete in Woodeaton is held 
 in the school grounds.
