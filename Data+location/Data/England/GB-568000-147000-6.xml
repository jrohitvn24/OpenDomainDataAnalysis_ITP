		<content> WE STARTED AT 'GROWIT NURSERIES'.THERE
 IS A NEW HOUSE ON THE RIGHT,AND ON THE
 LEFT A BIG HOP GARDEN. ON THE WAY WE  
 PASSED A BIG HOUSE CALLED 'NORMANS'   
 WHICH LOOKED VERY OLD.AT THE          
 CROSSROADS THERE IS A POSTBOX. A BIT  
 NEARER THE CROSSROADS THERE WERE TWO  
 OLD HOUSES; ONE OF THEM USED TO BE AN 
 OLD FARMHOUSE CALLED 'LITTLE BENOVER'.
 NEARBY IS A THATCHED HOUSE CALLED     
 'THATCHERS'. THE ROAD WE WERE WAITING 
 BY WAS VERY BUSY. WE SAW SOME GRAZING 
 LAND AND WE PASSED A PUB WHICH WAS    
 CALLED 'THE WOOLPACK'(THIS PUB IS 400 
 YEARS OLD).IT WAS CALLED THE WOOLPACK 
 BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT OF SHEEP     
 HERE.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
