   I get up about 8.0 am. and have     
breakfast: Coco Pops, milk and a cup of
tea and toast. Then I get dressed,     
washed and brush my hair. About 9.40 am
I go outside and wait for Delia to pick
me up and take me to church where we   
both sing in the choir. Then we get    
robed and maybe ring the bells. Then we
process down and have the service.     
After the service we are driven home   
and I quite often go on to Delia's to  
play. I go home at 5.30 pm. and have   
tea. It is usually a snack because we  
have Sunday Dinner at lunchtime. I go  
in the car with my mum to pick up Delia
and we go to church. The service is    
much the same as the morning's. When I 
get home I watch television until      
bedtime.
