		<content> My name is Sarah.Iam nine years old   
 and I have lived in this area all my  
 life.On a school day I get up at half 
 past seven.After getting dressed I go 
 down for breakfast.I usually have     
 cornflakes with milk and sugar.After  
 this I collect my things together for 
 school and put them in my bag.It takes
 me about twenty minutes to waik to    
 school.At school my favourite lesson  
 is mathematics.At playtime I play     
 games with my friends.I stay for      
 school dinners.we go home at half past
 three. when I get home I get changed  
 into my old clothes and I watch       
 television.After the childrens        
 programmes I go next door for my      
 friend and then we go and play in the 
 park. We have tea about half past     
 five,my favourite is chops and chips.I
