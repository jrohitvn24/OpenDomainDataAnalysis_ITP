		<content>    Food is a topic close to all our   
 hearts, and I am going to describe to 
 you the sorts of food I eat at this   
 moment in time in 1985.               
    Most meals include real meat,      
 whether it be beef, or chicken, or    
 sausages or bacon.  Even eggs make an 
 appearance, boiled, fried or poached. 
 Breakfast consists of cereal (Corn    
 Flakes), with tea to drink and toast  
 to follow.  Sometimes bacon and eggs  
 also appear on the menu.              
    Dinnertime is not a snack but a    
 main meal, with anything from         
 fishcakes to sphagetti, but with      
 by-far the most popular ingredient    
 being CHIPS - and LOTS of them!       
    Tea is usually combined with supper
 to form a high-tea, and some may say  
 I'm greedy, but it is yet another     
 cooked meal.  Sometimes I vary it with
 salad.                                </content>
