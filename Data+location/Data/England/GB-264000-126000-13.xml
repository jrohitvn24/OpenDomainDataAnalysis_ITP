		<title>13Interview: a local resident</title>
		<content> Mr. Cyril Williams interview          
 continued.                            
 "The books we used to read were       
 Masterman Ready, Coral Island and     
 Little Duke.  We had no school        
 outings. There were books at school   
 but not a proper library."            
 For Christmas he recalled "I used to  
 get a good meal but didn't get any    
 presents, just a few nuts and an      
 orange."                              
 For holidays in the summer "Sometimes 
 I would go and stay with my gran.  To 
 get there we would go to Filleigh     
 Station, get the train to Barnstaple  
 then on the Lynton line for           
 Blackmoor Gate Station."              
 "If we went to market we used to walk.
  We used to buy toffees, ten a penny, 
 old money, and also bullseyes and     
 strips of liquorise."
