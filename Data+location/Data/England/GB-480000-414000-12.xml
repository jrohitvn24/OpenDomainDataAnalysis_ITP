		<title>12Housing,Hobbies in Eastoft</title>
		<content> Housing--There are mainly detached    
 properties including farm houses.There
 is a small council block with about 36
 blocks of semi-detached houses,8      
 bungalows and 6 flats.The last were   
 built in 1975.                        
     Recreation--Very little recreation
 in the village,people have to travel  
 out.Eastoft is on a bus route,but     
 there is small demand for the service 
 as most people use cars.About 4 buses 
 leave daily except on Sundays,a school
 bus travels to the Secondary School   
 and another takes students to the     
 Colleges at Scunthorpe.The opening of 
 the M.18 motorway has reduced the flow
 of traffic between Goole and Eastoft. 
    Religions--In the villages there   
 are a few Methodists but the rest of  
 the approx.350 inhabitants are equally
 split between Roman Catholics and     
 Church of England.                    </content>
