		<title>14CHILDHOOD IN ADELAIDE(i)</title>
		<content> This account is taken from an         
 interview with a lady who lived in    
 Queen Adelaide as a child in the      
 1950s'.She lived in a semi_detached   
 house on the river bank; it had three 
 bedrooms but no bathroom, flush toilet
 or electricity because the mains      
 services did not reach as far as      
 Adelaide. The house had a large garden
 and her father grew all the vegetables
 they needed and kept a pig and some   
 chickens. It was isolated because they
 had no car and there was only one bus 
 a week, to Ely on Thursdays-Market    
 Day. She had to walk two miles to     
 school at Prickwillow. There were     
 forty children in the school, all     
 taught by the same teacher.They had   
 school sports in the summer and a     
 village fete.
