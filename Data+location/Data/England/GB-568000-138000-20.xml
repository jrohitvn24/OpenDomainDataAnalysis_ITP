		<title>20Horsmonden Today</title>
		<content>Today Horsmonden is a busy village     
surrounded by the intensely-cultivated 
Weald of Kent &amp; still considerably     
dependent on farming &amp; its services.   
There is much concern over the status  
of hard fruit &amp; hops in the European   
Economic Community: in recent years    
many acres of traditional orchards &amp;   
hop-gardens have been cleared as being 
uneconomic, &amp; cereals planted.         
Heavy lorries serving fruit storage    
depots in the area are also of concern,
damaging our lanes, swamping local     
traffic &amp; shaking our homes.           
Public Transport is very limited: the  
railway line was closed in 1962, &amp; more
recently bus services have been cut.   
Those without cars worry about being   
isolated.                              
It is not all idyll, living in the     
country in 1985!
