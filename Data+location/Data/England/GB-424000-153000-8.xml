 This building has had a number of     
 uses.At one time it was the local     
 police station but for the last thirty
 years it has been a cafe, restaurant  
 and now a licensed house. Its name has
 also changed, from Sally Lunn's to    
 Sarum Grill to the Last Straw. It is  
 by this last name that it is now      
 known.The change in use is the result 
 of a change in peoples's eating habits
 as most people now wish to have a     
 drink with their meal.The proprietor  
 has catered for this. It is a very    
 popular restaurant with people coming 
 from a wide area. Meals are served at 
 lunchtime as well as in the evening.  
 The building is a well-known tourist  
 attraction because of its thatched    
 roof and oak beams, though part of the
 building is modern and was built to   
 match in with the older part.         </content>
