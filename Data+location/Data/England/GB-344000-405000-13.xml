		<content>   HOW DO YOU SELL YOUR PRODUCE? It is 
 all sold wholesale to local merchants.
 We do not sell direct to the public.  
   HOW HAS THE JOB CHANGED SINCE YOU   
 WERE A BOY? We have tried growing a   
 larger variety of crops recently. The 
 biggest change has been the reliance  
 on modern machines and the use of     
 fertilisers and pesticides. This has  
 probably doubled our yield in the last
 25 years.                             
  CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOUR YEAR IS     
 DIVIDED UP? Spring is spent planting  
 potatoes,fertilising and spraying. We 
 also sell the previous year's crop of 
 potatoes.In summer we combine and bale
 and cut and sell the greens.By autumn 
 we are sowing cereals and harvesting  
 potatoes.Winter is spent ploughing and
 in maintenance.                       
  DO YOU ENJOY YOUR JOB? Yes,very much 
 even though it is hard work.          </content>
