		<title>02Newquay's Tourism-Historical</title>
		<content>    Newquay is the largest tourist     
 resort on the north Cornish coast,and 
 attracts large numbers of visitors    
 which boost the population of the area
 by 163% to over 70,000.               
                                       
    Newquay developed as a tourist     
 resort from two original villages     
 whose total population was just 489.  
                                       
    Trenance valley is sheltered from  
 the high winds and salt sprays which  
 affect most of Newquay and it was soon
 realised that the sunny,sheltered and 
 rolling nature of the valley provided 
 a pleasant contrast to the bracing air
 and cliff scenery of the coast.In 1906
 the upper part of the valley was laid 
 out for public gardens and the natural
 track widened for vehicles.With the   
 coming of the railways Newquay's      
 tourist business soon flourished.     </content>
