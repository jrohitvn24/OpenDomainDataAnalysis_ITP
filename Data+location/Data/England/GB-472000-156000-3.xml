		<content> An old bottle-kiln can be seen at the 
{disused Hazeley Bottom Brickworks.    
 The{C.15th Mattingley Church}with its 
 timber-frame is reputed to be built   
 from bricks burnt on Hazeley Heath as 
 are many local cottages. There are    
 many half-timbered (some thatched)    
 cottages &amp; some attractive farm buil- 
 dings &amp; granaries.{Historic buildings 
 include Dipley Mill, The Dutch House, 
 Hartley Grange, Hazeley House &amp; 'The  
 Leather Bottle' Public House but the  
 best known is the{National Trust      
{property 'West Green House'.}Also of  
 interest are the C.18th{West Green    
{Causeway}built by General Hawley to   
 link West Green House to The Dutch    
 House; the{Old Drove Road}near Damales
 Farm, which once went from Reading to 
 Odiham Fair &amp;{Bluehouse}Farm, formerly
 the{brewhouse}for the Leather Bottle, 
 hence 'Bottle Lane' which links them. </content>
