		<title>08Medieval Kettlesing</title>
		<content>   The Kettlesing area was recorded    
 "waste" in the original Domesday Book,
 mainly due to the devestation of the  
 North by William the Conqueror. It is 
 probable that peasant labour would    
 have been moved from upland manors    
 to the devestated, yet still fertile, 
 lowland demesnes of the Vale of York. 
   In early medieval times the area    
 became part of the royal hunting For- 
 est of Knaresborough, and experienced 
 relative prosperity until the ravages 
 of the Black Death led to severe      
 depopulation (estimate 40%) causing   
 the adoption of less labour-intensive 
 farming methods, particularly sheep-  
 farming. It is probable that popula-  
 tion figures did not regain their pre-
 Black Death levels for over 400 years.
