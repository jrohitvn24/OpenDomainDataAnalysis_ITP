		<title>11IREBY COUNTRY FAIR</title>
		<content> The Ireby Country Fair was introduced 
 in 1975. The aim of the Fair is to    
 turn back the clock and recreate a    
 little of the past; to bring back the 
 old crafts, traditions,sports and     
 pastimes and, above all, the          
 atmosphere of the last century; to    
 bring together all those who would    
 like to see tradition live on. The    
 Fair is now held once every five years
 and on the last occasion in 1981 there
 were among other things, a Mock       
 Hiring, Silver Band, a Meet of the    
 Hunt, Craft Stalls and Displays,      
 Morris Dancing, Sports, Old Time Music
 Hall and a Country Dance. Proceeds    
 from the event are divided equally    
 between village organisations and     
 charity.
