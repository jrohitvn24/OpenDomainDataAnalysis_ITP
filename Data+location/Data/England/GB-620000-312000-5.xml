		<content> My family are all up by about 9.00am  
and dad cooks the breakfast using the  
gas hob.It is usually sausage,egg and  
fried bread for breakfast.Through the  
day my dad may do some gardening or    
mow the lawn with our mower that you   
can sit on.Mum might do some washing in
our washing machine.Dinner is about    
1.00pm and is usually sandwiches.I may 
have corned beef or ham.Later we might 
watch our tele or maybe hire a film for
our video recorder.Later on we all     
usually troop down to the river to our 
tennis court and play a game.After, we 
go to the chinese take away and have a 
meal,I usually have duck and mushrooms 
in sauce.Later we watch T.V.again and  
we feed our cat.At about 10.45pm I go  
to bed and listen to my radio until    
about 11.00pm when I fall asleep.
