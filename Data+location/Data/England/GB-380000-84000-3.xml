		<title>03ATOMIC ENERGY ESTABLISHMENT</title>
		<content> The A.E.E.was set up by the United    
 Kingdom Establishment in the 1950s.to 
 undertake research into the physics of
 various types of reactors which could 
 generate electricity from nuclear     
 power.The largest reactor is still    
 generating electricity un 1985,but the
 work has now diversified into the     
 safety studies of reactors;nuclear    
 waste transport;the chemistry of      
 storing nuclear wastes and many other 
 non_nuclear projects including        
 optimising recovery of oil from the   
 North Sea.                            
 There is an apprenticeship scheme     
 which takes on about 20 young people a
 year.The site employs about 1800      
 people.There are many facilities for  
 the staff including tennis courts,    
 football and volley ball pitches,and a
 Gymnasium.A Bank visits the site on   
 three days a week for use of the staff</content>
