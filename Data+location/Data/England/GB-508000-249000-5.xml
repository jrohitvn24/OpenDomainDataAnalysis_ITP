		<content> THE PADDOCK.  MY FATHER RENTS A 3-4   
 ACRE FIELD WHICH USED TO BE WASTELAND 
 FROM THE COUNCIL.IT IS NOT A VERY GOOD
 PIECE OF GRASSLAND FOR PONIES BUT IT  
 IS CLOSE TO MY HOME AND SCHOOL.       
 THERE IS A HEDGE THROUGH THE MIDDLE   
 AND SOME BUSHES HAVE GROWN.AT PRESENT 
 WE HAVE AN OLD BATH TUB FOR A WATER   
 TROUGH,A SALT LICK AND A HITCHING     
 RAIL.THIS YEAR WE WILL SEPARATE OFF   
 PART OF THE FIELD AND BUILD A STABLE  
 AND YARD WITH A BRACKEN FLOOR.        
 WE WILL KEEP THE BARBED WIRE          
 FENCE.ALTHOUGH IT IS DANGEROUS IT DOES
 PREVENT PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER IT OR    
 STANDING ON IT.WE KEEP THE GATE FIRMLY
 PADLOCKED.                            
 THIS FIELD IS ON THE ELMS FARM ESTATE 
 AND IS IN THE N.E.CORNER OF BEDFORD.
