 workers, tenant or owner farmers can  
 no longer be considered the principle 
 occupation due to incresed            
 agricultural automation.              
 Many people now commute to Norwich    
 (about 13 miles) Gt.Yarmouth (about 7 
 miles).                               
 The developement of the Oil           
 business in the North Sea makes it the
 most significant industry. People are 
 employed either as shift workers on   
 rigs or onshore in the supporting     
 trades and catering.                  
 The sugar beet factory at Cantley also
 provides jobs mainly on a seasonal    
 basis from September to January. The  
 factory processes beet from all       
 over the Eastern half of Norfolk.
