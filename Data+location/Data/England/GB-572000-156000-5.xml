		<title>05 TRANSPORT IN MAIDSTONE</title>
		<content>    Within Maidstone there are a       
 variety of{transport types: the River 
{Medway, an extensive road network and 
{two railway}lines. Some have declined,
 while others have flourished.         
    The{River}Medway, once used for    
 transportation purposes, is now useful
 for{leisure}activities - boats, walks 
 and fishing.There are signs showing   
 where industry was sited in the past  
 to use the river.                     
    The two{railway}lines serve to link
 Maidstone with London and the South   
 coast. It provides an important       
{commuter}link and has three stations. 
   {Roads}radiate from Maidstone - the 
 most important being the M20,the A20  
 and the A229. Kent County Council has 
 a Â£30 million scheme to ease traffic  
 congestion in the near future.
