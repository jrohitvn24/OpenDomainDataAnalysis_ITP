		<title>08PLAYGROUND GAMES IN WAVERTON</title>
		<content> One of the games we play is called    
 Walley Ball and I thought it up.Some  
 one called it hits the ball as far as 
 possible with a bat.Everyone then     
 hides while he gets the ball and      
 brings it back to the start.He then   
 has to find everyone else beforem they
 can get to the ball and say Walley    
 Ball 1.2.3.Save myself.If the person  
 who is it sees someone he has to run  
 to the ball and say Walley Ball 1.2.3 
 and name them.He tries to find and    
 name as many people as possible before
 they can save themselves.When everyone
 is found or saved the game is over.   
 This game is a development of Ickie   
 Dickie.We also play Chain Tick,Base   
 123,Relievo,line tick,stick in the mud
 wall tick,ball tick,off ground tick,  
 and elastics.Another favourite is Red 
 Letter which is a tick game based on  
 the letters of the alphabet.          </content>
