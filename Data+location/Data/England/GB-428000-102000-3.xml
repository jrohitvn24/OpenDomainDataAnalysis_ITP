		<content>{Brusher Mills}was born on March 19th  
 1838.Sadly he died at the age of 67 on
 July 1st 1905.Brusher was described,in
 the New Forest as one of the chief    
 personalities,his real name was{Henry 
{Mills.}He acquired the nickname of{   
{Brusher'}because he used to brush     
 clean the wickets of the local cricket
 grounds.But a more probable story is  
 that it was given to him one hard,cold
 winter when daily brushed the ice for 
 skaters on the lake in Foxlease park  
 but his main occupation was snake     
 catching.A habitat favoured by Brusher
 was the Railway Inn at Brockenhurst   
 and was recently renamed {The Snake   
{Catcher}in his memory.The summer of   
 1884 was the year when Brusher took   
 to sleeping in a disused charcoal     
 burners hut.He lived there for 19     
 years and 4 months but the hut was    
 burnt in 1903.                        </content>
