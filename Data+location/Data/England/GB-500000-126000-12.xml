		<title>12Linfold Farm</title>
		<content>     Mr Osmaston owns Linfold Farm.He  
 was brought up on a farm.When he left 
 school he became an engineer and      
 then he had a chance to own Linfold   
 Farm so he did.Now he has been twenty 
 years on the farm and has got one     
 hundred and forty acres.He has a small
 tractor.                              
      He has got fifty three suckler   
 cows,twenty eight yearlings and thirty
 calves.The dairy farmer uses silage in
 the winter for cows.                  
      Farmers try to grow as many crops
 as they can and the farming season    
 starts about autumn.The farmers have  
 to spray the corn with fertilizer and 
 then leave it.With a combine harvester
 you could do twenty to thirty acres a 
 day.
