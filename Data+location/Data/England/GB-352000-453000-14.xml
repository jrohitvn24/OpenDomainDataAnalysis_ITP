		<title>14OVER WYRESDALE:TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> Very few people are without transport 
 today, the most popular form being the
 petrol-engined motor car. This makes  
 public transport almost unnecessary   
 except for the conveyance of school   
 children and people under the age of  
 17. The public bus service only runs 3
 days per week when secondary schools  
 are on holiday. On Sundays there is no
 service at all. During school holidays
 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays a  
 morning service runs to Lancaster but 
 there is no return service, no-one    
 knows why. Children under 11 years of 
 age in the area, attending school and 
 having 2 miles or more to travel are  
 entitled to free transport by minibus.
 This also runs a feeder service to    
 convey children over 11 years to the  
 public bus to Lancaster. All goods are
 carried by diesel-engined lorries or  
 vans. There is no railway or canal.   </content>
