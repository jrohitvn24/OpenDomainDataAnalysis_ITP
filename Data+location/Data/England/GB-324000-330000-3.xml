		<content>{English}is universally spoken,        
 although this area is adjacent        
 to Wales. The{Welsh}influence is still
 evident among the older generation,   
 and particularly those who have lived 
 locally all their lives. Today,       
 however, these people would converse  
 in English. Children in the area, once
 educated at small schools in          
 Rhydycroesau and Pant Glas, now go to 
 primary schools in Oswestry or        
 Selattyn, or to secondary schools in  
 Oswestry, where all teaching is in    
{English.} A small number of children  
 have private lessons in{Welsh}. A     
 visit to Oswestry on its market day,  
 Wednesday, will enable {Welsh}to be   
 heard spoken on the streets, as many  
 farmers from the west come to town    
 on business.
