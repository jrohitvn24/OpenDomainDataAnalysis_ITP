		<content> Rochford Fair has been described in   
 the press as "the town's entertainment
 extravaganza".  The show is jointly   
 organised by David Keddie, who owns a 
 large department store in Southend and
 Rochford Council.  This year it is    
 estimated that more than 15,000 people
 attended the show.  As well as an     
 abundance of the usual fete side-     
 stalls and stands, the Red Devil      
 Parachute Team performed and there was
 a display by the Marlboro bi-plane    
 fliers, helicopter rides, go-cart     
 racing plus a display of traction     
 engines.  The show was also a valuable
 platform for local industry as several
 local businesses took stands.  There  
 was entertainment to suit everybody   
 and it is becoming a very popular     
 local event.  It is also nice to know 
 that the show has helped to raise     
 money for several local charities.    </content>
