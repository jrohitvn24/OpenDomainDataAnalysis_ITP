		<title>12Weekley, Kettering.</title>
		<content>  No doubt Weekley owes its unspoiled  
appearance to the fact that it is a    
Boughton Estate village.  Indeed the   
Estate Office is here and a maintenance
yard too.                              
  The A43(T) road makes a hazardous    
bend through the village and it is     
here that motorists and lorry drivers  
may experience difficulties in winter. 
  Weekley has a mixture of housing.    
There are 8 modern bugalows for the    
elderly, a few impressive large houses 
and the lovely old stone cottages 26 of
which are thatched.  There is even a   
thatched outhouse!                     
   All the properties are extremely    
well cared for and in summer the       
gardens are a mass of colour.          
   It is hardly surprising that such a 
village would wish to enter a Â£Best    
Kept Village' competition.  They should
stand a good chance of winning.        </content>
