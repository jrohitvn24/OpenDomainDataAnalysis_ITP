		<content>{AN INTERVIEW WITH A RETIRED TEACHER   
{FROM NATIONAL SCHOOL, TODMORDEN.      
   We interviewed Mrs.Horne about the  
 school 60 years ago.When she first    
 came to the school,as a pupil,she was 
 only 3 years old.There were 10 or 11  
 classes in the school,(now there are  
 only 7).                              
   The children in Mrs.Hornes' time    
 wore clogs and they had fun seeing who
 could make the most sparks.For sport  
 they would play a game and do         
 exercises.These would be,arms in,arms 
 out,up,down,touch your shoulders and  
 touch your toes.They did them standing
 on chairs.                            
   They all went home for dinner.Those 
 pupils who could not afford a dinner  
 got a ticket and went to a cafe to get
 potatoe pie.                          
   If anyone talked, when the teacher  
 left the room, they all got the cane. </content>
