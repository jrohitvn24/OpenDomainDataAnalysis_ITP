		<content> The private motor car is the          
 favourite means of transport.  There  
 is usually one to every househol and  
 often two.  Those people who do not   
 have a car do have a bus service, but 
 it is limited.  There are 7 buses per 
 day to Rye and 6 to Hastings. There   
 is no Sunday service and the last     
 buses go through about 6 p.m.  If you 
 wish to travel to London or betond yb 
 train you can go via Rye (eastwards)  
 or via Robertsbridge (westwards), but 
 either way the journey takes two      
 hours.  The bicycle is sometimes used 
 by both young and older folk, but due 
 to the speed of the traffic it is     
 considered a risk.  A 40 mph speed    
 limit was introduced in l985. Udimore 
 has a high percentage of heavy goods  
 vehicles on its B2089 road and it is  
 quite a dangerous road.
