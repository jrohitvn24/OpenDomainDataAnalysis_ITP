		<title>20RESERVOIR KEEPER COLD ASHTON</title>
		<content>    The reservoir keeper is a typical  
 local{resident}of Cold Ashton. He     
 enjoys its rural character and hopes  
 to preserve it.He has lived and worked
 in the area for{32 years}and brought  
 his family up there.                  
    His{job}has changed somewhat over  
 he years. Originally he was totally   
 responsible for the reservoir, which  
 he found very satisfying. Now he      
 only has to do the daily safety checks
 but he has to monitor polution over a 
 large area of Wessex.                 
   He was{Chairman of the Parish       
{Council}for a time during which a     
{help scheme}for people needing to     
 visit doctors, hospitals etc was      
 organised, as public transport is     
 difficult.He worries that the{property
 is being improved and enlarged so much
 that it is beyond the buying capacity 
 of local{young people.                </content>
