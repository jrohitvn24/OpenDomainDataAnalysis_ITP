		<title>12BAWDLANDS DISASTER CLITHEROE</title>
		<content>    The residents of Bawdlands had     
 alway been worried of a vehicle going 
 out of control and landing 10 feet on 
 their street. One day that happened.  
 It was May 31st 1985. A trailer with  
 three heifers was coming back from the
 Auction Mart. Just when it had turned 
 the bend on Railway Bridge the        
 coupling snapped and the trailer      
 knocked down tons of masonary. This   
 also brought down fifty yards of iron 
 railings, these landing only yards    
 from the terraced houses.             
    Fortunately no one was killed and  
 the cows were only shocked, apart from
 one which had a broken horn.          
    As there was a danger to           
 pedestrians wooden railings were put  
 up by the County Councils Highway     
 Department although it is the         
 responsibility of British Rail.
