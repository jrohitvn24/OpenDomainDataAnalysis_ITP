		<title>03BOTLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Botley village was mentioned in the   
 first Domesday book.There is a church 
 still in Botley that was there at     
 that time.                            
 Since then the village has moved about
 half a mile away.In the village lived 
 a very famous man whose name was      
 William Cobbett.He wrote a book called
 "Rural Rides" in 1819,describing      
 Hampshire.                            
  The village has a market square where
 farmers came to sell their            
 strawberries.Botley has three main    
 buildings:a market hall,a flour mill  
 and a church.The market hall was built
 in 1848 and re-opened in 1897,the year
 of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee.It
 is an impressive building,faced with  
 stone and painted white.Outside there 
 are columns and a clock tower.
