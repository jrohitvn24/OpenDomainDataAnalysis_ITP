		<title>07Jack, who lives in Hemsworth</title>
		<content> Jack is seventy years old and has     
 lived in Hemsworth all his life.  As a
 lad he used used to play on waste land
 which is now the Park. He used to play
 hide and seek or football.            
 There has been a market in Hemsworth  
 for as long as Jack can remember.     
 Jack used to work at Brierly Pit and  
 he had to walk there, about one and a 
 half miles. He doesn't go very far now
 but he is never lonely as he has his  
 goose and dog for company.            
 Jack thinks that people are not as    
 friendly now as they used to be.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
