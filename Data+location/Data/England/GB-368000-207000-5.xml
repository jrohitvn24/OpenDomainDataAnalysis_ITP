		<title>05BULLO PILL HARBOUR</title>
		<content> LAST CENTURY BULLO PILL WAS A HARBOUR 
 WHICH WAS BUSY ENOUGH TO TAKE MOST OF 
 THE TRADE FROM LYDNEY HARBOUR,BECAUSE 
 IT WAS NEARER BY ROAD TO GLOUCESTER.  
 THE HARBOUR BEGAN TO SILT UP AND A    
 CANAL WAS BUILT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF  
 THE SEVERN WHICH TOOK GOODS ALL THE   
 WAY TO THE HEART OF GLOUCESTER.       
 BY 1900 BULLO PILL HARBOUR WAS        
 ABANDONED AND NOW THE QUAY WALLS HAVE 
 HUGE GAPS;THE GATES ARE ROTTED AND    
 HANGING OFF THEIR POSTS. THE OWNER    
 TOLD US THE GATES ALONE WOULD COST    
 Â£60,000 TO REPLACE. HE HOPES IT WILL  
 BE POSSIBLE TO DEVOLOP THE SITE AS A  
 YACHT MARINA AND AS A TOURIST         
 ATTRACTION.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
