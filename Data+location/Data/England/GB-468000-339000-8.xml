		<title>08TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content>    A first year class from Toot Hill  
 School conducted a detailed survey of 
 the traffic that passed through       
 Bingham at three different times of   
 the day. The survey took place at the 
 traffic lights on the main A52 road   
 and the number of vehicles and the    
 direction they were taking were noted.
 In all 1874 vehicles were counted. The
 busiest time was from 10.20 to 10.50  
 in the morning. Over 300 lorries, 250 
 vans and 1200 cars were counted. Most 
 of these vehicles were just passing   
 through Bingham.                      
   This main road is extremely         
 dangerous and difficult to cross and a
 bypass is planned with work due to    
 start in 1986.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
