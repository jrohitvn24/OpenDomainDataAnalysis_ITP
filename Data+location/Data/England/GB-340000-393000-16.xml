		<content>   {Operation Groundwork}helped our    
 school to make a garden by pulling out
 the weeds and planting flowers.   They
 came to see who had the best ideas.  {
{Steven}won a bird table and a T shirt.
 They helped us clear out our pond,    
 getting out rubbish and bits of wood  
 which filled a skip up to the top.    
 We made a bonfire with the wood.   We 
 got very warm by the fire, but we were
 all wet and dirty.   We planted       
 flowers round as well.                
    We went to a wood to plant acorns  
 by standing on them and making them   
 stick in the ground.   In years to    
 come they will grow into big oak      
 trees.   We went to the BMX course to 
 plant some flowers.   Now it looks    
 better.   We have done a lot of things
 with them.
