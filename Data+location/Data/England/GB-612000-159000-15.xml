		<content>Tyler Hill Village has maintained      
throughout the 20th.Century a          
resourceful rural community life.      
Peoples jobs in 1900 serviced the local
community...blacksmith dairyman grocer 
laundry postoffice market gardener 2   
public houses 3 farmers                
haulage-contractor hop workers &amp;       
railway workers. About 1930 there was  
economic growth with a florist miller- 
baker timber merchant poultry farmer   
decorator and tea-room in addition to  
the 1900 trades. In 1960 cars and buses
enabled people to look outward for work
Trades dramatically declined. Only the 
PO/Shop pub. builders yard and farmers 
remained.In 1985 houses have increased 
and local jobs decreased.  However,    
village life is flourishing, as can be
