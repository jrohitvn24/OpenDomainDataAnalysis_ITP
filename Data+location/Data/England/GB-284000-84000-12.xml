{DODDISCOMBSLEIGH SCHOOL}IS THE VERY   
 BEST SCHOOL IN THE TEIGN_VALLEY I     
 THINK.BUT LOTS OF CHANGES HAVE BEEN   
 MADE.THE POPULATION OF CHILDREN HAS   
 GONE DOWN OVER THE YEARS.THE GIRLS AND
 BOYS TOILETS HAVE BEEN REDONE AND WE  
 ALL HAVE HAD  MORE SPORTS FACILITIES  
 TO PRACTICE WITH.WE HAVE HAD THE      
 CHANCE TO GO OUT MORE AND DO MORE     
 DIFFERENT THINGS EACH TIME.WE HAVE HAD
 LOTS OF DIFFERENT TEACHERS TEACHING   
 US,AND LOVELY DINNERS.WE HAVE HAD TWO 
 CARETAKERS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS,MRS
 WESTCOTT AND MRSWORE.THERE HAS BEEN A 
 LOT OF CHANGES.
