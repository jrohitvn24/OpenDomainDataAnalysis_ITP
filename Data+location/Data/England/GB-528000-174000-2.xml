		<title>02A Muslim living in Brixton.</title>
		<content>My name is Ashraf.  I come from        
Bangladesh.  Now we live in Brixton.   
We can not go to our Mosque each week  
because they are far away.  But my     
whole family prays five times a day.   
We live in a block of flats.  It is not
safe to go outside and walk on the     
paths alone ater 5 or 6pm especially   
when you are a muslim.  My mum and my  
sister pray at home on special days,   
while me and my little brother and my  
dad go to the mosque.  We believe in   
Muhammed.  In 1983 I went to           
Bangladesh. I want to go again and my  
dad said I will go next year. In school
nobody calls me names.  I mostly make  
friends with muslims or other boys from
other lands.  In assembly when we say  
our prayers I dont say anything but I  
say a short prayer in my own language.
