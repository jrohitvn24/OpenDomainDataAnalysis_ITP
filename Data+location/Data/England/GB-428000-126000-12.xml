		<title>12Buildings in Lockerley</title>
		<content> Lockerley has always been a farming   
 community and the names of some of the
 houses give us clues about this life  
 eg. Meadow End, Horseshoe Cottage,    
 Drove End, Hill View, Green View, The 
 Cricketers, Hawkstone Cottage, Holbury
 View and Beech Cottage.               
 Drove End Cottage reminds us of the   
 time when the sheep were taken to     
 market at the sheep fair near Andover.
 We have a shepherd who lives and works
 in Lockerley.                         
 Until recently, the Lockerley Hall    
 Estate has been the most important    
 influence in the village. Some        
 villagers live in Estate houses as    
 tenants and work on the Estate. Mary  
 Langdown lives in one of these houses 
 and at present it is having a new     
 tiled roof. However, in the village   
 you will find alternative roofing     
 materials such as thatch.             </content>
