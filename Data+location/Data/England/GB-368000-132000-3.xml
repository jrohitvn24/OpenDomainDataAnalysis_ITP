		<content> Although Bruton is mainly an          
 agricultural community, there are a   
 number of light industries in the     
 twon. Based around Station Road is a  
 small industrial estate, where there  
 is a large antique warehouse,         
 specialising in the export of antiques
 to America and Australia, a garden    
 centre, a vehicle body shop, a heavy  
 plant hire firm, and a coach hire     
 firm.  Elsewhere in the town, is a    
 seed mill, which (apart from the      
 schools) is one of the main employers,
 and sends its products to farmers     
 throughout the West Country.  There is
 also a firm of agricultural hauliers, 
 which transports cattle and sheep to  
 all manner of destinations.  There is 
 a small pottery, a shop specialising  
 in the restoration of antique         
 furniture and clocks, and a cabinet   
 maker.                                </content>
