		<content> THE MOBILE AND THE FIXED DUNES ARE    
 FAIRLY SIMILAR ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE   
 PLANT LIFE ON THE MOBILE DUNES IS     
 MARAM GRASS WHEREAS THE FIXED DUNES   
 MAINLY HAVE RED FESCUE.ALTHOUGH THERE 
 ARE A FEW FLOWERS SUCH AS BIRDS-FOOT  
 TREFOIL,EVENING PRIMROSE,RAGWORT AND  
 DUNE HELLEBORINE WHICH IS A VERY RARE 
 ORCHID.THESE PLANTS ARE ONE OF THE    
 FIRST LINKS IN A LARGE FOOD CHAIN.NEXT
 ARE THE INSECTS SUCH AS FROG          
 HOPPERS,APHIDS AND A LARGE RANGE OF   
 DIFFERENT BUGS.THESE IN TURN ARE EATEN
 BY SPIDERS,LADYBIRDS,LACE-WINGS AND   
 TIGER BEETLES.THESE AGAIN ARE EATEN BY
 LARGER ANIMALS LIKE                   
 BIRDS,RABBITS,HEDGE-HOGS,SQUIRELS AND 
 BATS.LAST OF ALL IN THE FOOD CHAIN    
 COME THE LARGER ANIMALS LIKE FOXES AND
 SMALL BIRDS OF PREY.
