		<content> Most people in the area belong to one 
 club or another.The{British Legion}has
 a strong following and organises      
 dances,excursions and galas.There is a
{Country Club}in Milborne Port at which
 there are functions on most nights.   
 There are six public houses and three 
 restaurants which are all well        
 patronised.                           
 The {Village hall}holds many different
 entertainments as do the local        
 churches. There is very little for    
 young people to do in the area so they
 have to go to Yeovil for most of their
 entertainment which is very costly.   
 There is one night club {Tapps Hotel} 
 which holds regular discos and live   
 entertainment.                        
 The local hunt is also very active.   
 The general rule is,if one wants      
 entertainment one makes it.
