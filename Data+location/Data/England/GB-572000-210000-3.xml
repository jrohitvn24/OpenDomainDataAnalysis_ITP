		<content> Until the Second World War much  of   
 the area to the North of Boreham      
 Village was woodland or farmland.Then 
 about 630 Acres were cleared to build 
 an airfield. This was used by the     
 American Airforce to launch Marauders 
 (Fighter Bombers).                    
 The airfield, one of many built at    
 that time in East Anglia, was not     
 needed for its original purpose when  
 peace had been declared.              
 It was first used as a race track     
 (Mike Hawthorn holds the track record)
 but although the terrain was ideal for
 racing, access to the site was        
 difficult,and the race track was short
 lived.                                
 Next the site was used by the County  
 Council,who were the owners, for      
 storage purposes.The large hanger     
 being particularly suitable for this.
