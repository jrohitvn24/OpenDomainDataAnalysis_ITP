		<title>05HISTORY OF CROSFIELDS SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The earliest date of Crosfields was in
 1643 when King Charles 1st stayed     
 there and said that he had had a "    
 good rest".That building was knocked  
 down and a new one called "Goodrest"  
 was built in 1820 by Sir Francis      
 Englefield. By 1945 it belonged to a  
 Colonel Beel and was used as a        
 convalescent home for soldiers injured
 in the 2nd World War.In 1946 it was   
 bought by Leighton Park School to be  
 used as a Junior School.This continued
 until 1957  when it became a separate 
 entity.The name "Crosfields" was      
 derived from the man who founded it,  
 Hugh Crosfield.The school emblem of 6 
 oakleaves is taken fom Marlbrough     
 school which has closed down. In 1985 
 there were 260 boys, 20 teachers and 8
 other staff.
