  This small church stands at the      
 junction of two minor roads close to a
 small group of houses.At present it   
 has a{membership of five}who attend   
 regularly.There is{no Sunday School   
 attached probably due to families     
 having grown up and there not being   
 many young children in the immediate  
 vicinity.                             
  A{graveyard}is beside the church     
 which is unusual in the Methodists.   
  The minister in charge is also       
 responsible for the Plympton Methodist
 Church.                               
  On special occasions, e.g. Harvest,  
  Church Anniversary etc., members of  
 other churches attend swelling the    
 size of the congregation.
