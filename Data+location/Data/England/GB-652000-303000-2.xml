		<title>02Shopping habits.</title>
		<content> In a survey of shopping habits carried
 out by students of the Sixth Form     
 College in Spring 1983, it was found  
 that some half of the people          
 interviewed who lived in Gorleston did
 their main convienience shopping for  
 foodstuffs in the town, but a         
 considerable preferred Yarmouth with  
 it's greater range of larger          
 supermarkets. For household goods     
 however, the size and quality of      
 Gorleston's stores was not attractive 
 and Yarmouth as well as Lowestoft and 
 Norwich tended to be more frquented.  
 The same trend was even more apparent 
 when clothing was bought. It was noted
 that there had been a change however  
 with Yarmouth becoming less popular   
 due to the problems of and cost of    
 parking there as well as the          
 difficulties of access along one road 
 and the only bridge, the Haven Bridge.</content>
