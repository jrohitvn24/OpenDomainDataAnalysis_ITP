		<content> THE RE-SUPPLY OF THE FALKLANDS        
 CONTINUES ON A DAILY BASIS WITH ONE   
 HERCULES AIR-TO-AIR REFUELLED SORTIE  
 FROM ASCENSION TO STANLEY.  THE       
 HERCULES HAS NOW BEEN MODIFIED AS A   
 TANKER TO GIVE FUEL AS WELL AS RECEIVE
 IT AND SOME ARE BASED IN STANLEY WHILE
 OTHERS ARE AT ASCENSION.  THIS        
 RE-SUPPLY TASK STILL ABSORBS A LARGE  
 PROPORTION OF THE STATION'S CAPACITY; 
 NEVERTHELESS THE HERCULES HAS RETURNED
 TO ITS ORIGINAL ROLES OF FREIGHT AND  
 PASSENGER FLYING AROUND THE WORLD AND 
 PARACHUTE DROPPING, BOTH ROLES BEING  
 OPERATED IN THE PURE MILITARY FORM AND
 FOR HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES WHEN NATURAL
 DISASTERS OCCUR.  THE STATION HAS     
 DEMONSTRATED ONCE AGAIN THAT IT IS    
 ALWAYS READY TO RESPOND TO ITS MOTTO  
 "SUPPORT, SAVE, SUPPLY".
