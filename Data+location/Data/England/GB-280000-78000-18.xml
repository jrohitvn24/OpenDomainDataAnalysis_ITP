 In 1646, Cromwell's army met Royalist 
 troops at Bovey Heath and defeated    
 them. The officers were playing cards 
 in Bovey Tracey. They managed to      
 escape capture by throwing the stakes 
 out of the window.Whilst Cromwell's   
 soldiers fought over the money the    
 officers escaped! The Arch in Abbey   
 road,called Cromwell's Arch is in fact
 earlier than Cromwell and is thought  
 to be part of an old Priory. Bovey    
 bridge was built in 1642 just before  
 Cromwell                              
 arrived.This is probably why the army 
 came through Bovey Tracey.It was the  
 best point to cross the River Bovey.
