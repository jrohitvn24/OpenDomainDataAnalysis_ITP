		<content> Mr Dingle gets up at 5:30 and gets the
 cows in from the field to milk them.He
 has 102 Friesian cows and after       
 milking they go back into the field.He
 then cleans the milking equipment and 
 the yards.For breakfast he has bacon  
 and eggs with coffee.The rest of the  
 morning is spent on routine jobs such 
 as injecting calves,dealing with sick 
 cows,or office work.In summer he is   
 busy cutting hay or silage.           
    After dinner at 1:00 he may go to  
 various societies such as the{National
{Farmers Union,}or{Royal Society for   
{Preservation of Birds.}At 4:00 the    
 cows are milked again.In winter most  
 of the day is spent feeding and       
 bedding the cows which are housed in  
 the barn.During the evening he may    
 attend a meeting of the{Parents       
{Association}at Budehaven School.
