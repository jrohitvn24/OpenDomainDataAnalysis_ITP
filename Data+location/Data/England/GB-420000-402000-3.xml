		<content> Many ancient pastures which have never
 been ploughed, and these show a       
 variety of wild plants. {SCOUT DYKE _ 
 Outdoor pursuits centre is run by     
 Barnsley Education Authority. Barnsley
 schools bring parties of children for 
 up to a week for environmental studies
 and outdoor activities. The centre was
 started in 1935 and provided the only 
 holiday that many Barnsley children   
 had in those days, although the       
 policity of the Education Committee   
 was that it should be a school camp   
 and not a holiday camp. A big improve_
 ment in the childrens' health was     
 noticed after a week at camp. {PETS }_
