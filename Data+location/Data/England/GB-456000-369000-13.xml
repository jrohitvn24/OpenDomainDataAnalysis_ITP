		<title>13Cuckney C.E.Primary School.</title>
		<content> Cuckney School is the oldest school in
 the area .Its building was once a     
 water-powered cotton_mill which was   
 standing in 1786.It has a roll of 65  
 children mostly from the catchment    
 area of Cuckney,Norton,Nether         
 Langwith,Holbeck and the Welbeck      
 Estate, who are divided by age into 3 
 classes.Most travel to school by bus. 
  It is unusual in that the Welbeck    
 Estate has granted it the use of the  
 adjoining mill-dam for fishing,and the
 present Head Mr.L.J.Beldham raises    
 additional money for the school fund  
 by operating a community Fishing Club.
  There are 3 full-time and 1 part-time
 staff including the Head.Despite      
 falling rolls and the age of the      
 building ,money has recently been     
 spent on improvements such as Fire    
 alarms and Fire Doors.Mr.Beldham would
 like indoor toilets however.          </content>
