		<content> Most of our houses are very old and   
 built of stone from Bilsdale, the     
 stone is sandstone.  Lots of the      
 houses are modernised but some have   
 very old things in them. Some of our  
 houses have had the same families     
 living in them for more than 100      
 years.                                
  Bilsdale is a green hilly place to   
 look at and there are a lot of wild   
 animals and birds.When it is spring   
 there are wild daffodils and          
 snowdrops.Lots of people have gardens 
 which are well kept.                  
  The tracks on our moor are ancient   
 some go back to the Romans and some   
 were pack horse tracks. Our houses are
 joined by ancient tracks and we still 
 use the old tracks.                   
 We can see the Television Mast, which 
 is 1,000 feet high. It has navigation 
 lights every 100 feet.                </content>
