		<content> Unemployment is extremely high and    
 increasing in North Braunstone.Many   
 long term unemployed have inadequate  
 basic skills.The population is        
 relatively stable,although those      
 upwardly mobile tend to migrate to    
 other suburbs.It is difficult to find 
 sufficient quantities of unskilled and
 semi-skilled industries of engineering
 and hosiery.                          
 Within the overall situation of the   
 unemployed there are particularly     
 disadvantaged groups i.e. women,single
 parents,young people and the disabled.
 Through the outreach work of the      
 Community College staff complex       
 networks are developed to help raise  
 self-esteem,confidence,basic skills   
 and training.                         
 Some developments have been           
 playschemes,tatser courses,toy        
 libraries and workers lunches.        </content>
