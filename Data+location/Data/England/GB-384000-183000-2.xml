		<title>02THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY CROSS</title>
		<content>  Although the Domesday Book tells of a
 Saxon church nothing of it can be     
 identified for certain.The {Norman }  
 period is represented by a central row
 of pillars, that original small church
 being expanded by the north aisle,    
 transept and tower in the {English    
 style.The{Perpendicular}period is     
 represented in the south chapel and   
 transept.The upper part of the {tower 
 was rebuilt in the early 18th century 
 to Thomas Sumsion's design.           
  The {nave}holds an early 13th century
 font, 7 heavily carved{Norman}pillars 
 and a Perpendicular west window.The   
 North transept holds a 13th century { 
{tomb}possibly of a vicar.There are    
 several monuments of the 17th and 18th
 centuries.                            
  The five{bells}were rehung in 1979   
 and a treble added.
