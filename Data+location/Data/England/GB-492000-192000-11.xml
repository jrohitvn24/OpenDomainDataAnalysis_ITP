		<title>11A description of the area.</title>
		<content> This has to be one of the most        
 beautiful areas of the countryside to 
 live in. There are some well preserved
 old buildings and there are many many 
 footpaths on which to walk. When we   
 were trying to contact land owners of 
 the various farms, we found that there
 were in the main only two real owners.
 One of them was the Earl Howe. This is
 not surprising as historically the    
 Earls Howe have owned much of the     
 land. The most surprising aspect was  
 that nearly all of the farms had been 
 converted to luxury country retreats  
 and homes. It seems that most of the  
 farming is done by only a very few    
 farmers, notably The Grange Farm and  
 Seagraves Farm.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
