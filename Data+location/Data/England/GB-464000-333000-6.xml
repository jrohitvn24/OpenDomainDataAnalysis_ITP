 When I  arrived at school we did a    
 tables test. I got 19 out of 24 so I  
 had to stay in and learn them. Then we
 went swimming. I did my 200 metres    
 then                                  
 we went back to school and we did art.
 Then Mrs Purdam had us for songs and  
 story.It got to 3.30 and we had to go 
 home . When I got home I put my       
 roller-skates on.Then we had tea. It  
 was mince with Yorshire pudding. Then 
 I went back out side again.Then I     
 came in and my dad wanted me to take  
 the dog a walk. So I took him.When I  
 got back home I sat on my bean bag    
 while my dad was trying to sell a gas 
 fire and at 9.00 clock I went to bed.
