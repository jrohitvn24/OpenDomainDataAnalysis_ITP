		<content>  This area is in the Peak National    
 Park and comprises the parishes of    
 Elton, Gratton and Birchover. It is in
 the White Peak of Derbyshire ranging  
 in height from 170m. to 330m. and is  
 drained by tributaries of the River   
 Lathkill.                             
  The scenery is varied, ranging from  
 dry limestone moor with remains of old
 leadmines, now enclosed for grazing,  
 rocky gritstone outcrops, some        
 woodland and plantations, and meadows 
 and pasture in the dales.             
  The houses are all stone-built and   
 are concentrated in the villages with 
 only a few outlying farms. Fields are 
 small, bounded mainly by stone walls. 
  In addition to dairy and beef cattle 
 farming the area is being increasingly
 used for walking, camping and other   
 leisure pursuits.
