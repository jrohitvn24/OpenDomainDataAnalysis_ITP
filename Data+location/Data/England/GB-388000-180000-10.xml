 telephoned Group Captain Tootal       
 to ask him some questions about R.A.F 
 Hullavington.He said that there were  
 three barrage balloons filled with    
 hydrogen gas in operation.There were  
 16 hangars on The Camp which were in  
 use for different purposes. Most of   
 them did not contain aircraft. The    
 camp has also got 46 tanks for use by 
 the R.A.F.Regt. Since the Falklands   
 War of 1982 the camp has not changed a
 great deal.The camp trains an average 
 of 1200 men from the Balloon Office   
 per year .The area of the camp is 650 
 acres.During July 1985 a Squadron of  
 Harriers from R.A.F. Wittering was    
 using the airfield.
