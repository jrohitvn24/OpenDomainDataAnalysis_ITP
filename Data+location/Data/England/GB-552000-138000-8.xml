		<content> Variations on chasing or hide-and-    
 seek, with each side taking the       
 characters of heroes or villains are  
 always popular, as is 'messing about' 
 with a ball. Girls play with skipping 
 ropes and all enjoy using climbing    
 apparatus, slides and swings. 'Camps' 
 can be made in trees or bushes.       
 Younger children love sand and water. 
 Hop-scotch, marbles, fives and conkers
 are all annual crazes while roller    
 skating and Yo-yo twirling have been  
 popular recently.                     
   Many children play in school teams  
 at Football, Hockey, Cricket, Rugby,  
 Netball, Basketball, Running, Tennis, 
 Squash, Table-Tennis and Chess.       
   Indoors there are pastimes such as  
 model-making, painting and, for girls,
 sewing and knitting. Construction sets
 keep mainly boys occupied while all   
 play computer and board games.        </content>
