		<title>18THE STATION AREA</title>
		<content> Newton Abbot grew rapidly in the      
 nineteenth century as a Victorian {   
{railway}town.Today the railway station
 is still important and many streets of
 small terraced housing show how and   
 where the town developed. Beside the  
 railway a modern{industrial estate}has
 been established that is occupied by  
 mainly light manufacturing businesses.
 This part of the town is not without  
 its open spaces,and an attractive park
 called{Courtenay Park}spreads out in  
 front of the imposing station facade. 
 Towards the the centre of the town    
 along{Queens Street}the takeaways and 
 restaurants give way to clothes shops 
 and and large stores. Offices of all  
 types occupy sites in the centre      
 itself. The{bus station}still         
 flourishes providing a service to     
 neighbouring towns and villages as    
 well as coach tours for the summer.   </content>
