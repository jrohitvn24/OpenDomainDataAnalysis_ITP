		<title>08SOPLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   {Sopley}is the largest village in   
 our survey area. The history of the   
 village goes back to Saxon times when 
 a battle was fought on the site where 
 the church is now to be found. The    
 name of Sopley was taken from the     
 saxon leader{Soper}the original name  
 being{Sopersley}.                     
    The village has grown in recent    
 years as the nearby towns of {        
{Christchurch}and{Bournemouth}spread   
 towards the{New Forest.}A new housing 
 estate has doubled the original       
 population but the village still      
 manages to retain much of its charm.  
     There is a general store and post 
 office, a public house and a village  
 hall to serve the local population.   
 The church is described on an earlier 
 page and can be found near the old    
 water mill which is now used as a     
 warehouse.                            </content>
