		<content> The main meal in a working day,is     
 usually taken when the family         
 comes home for the evening and        
 wants something quick to cook ,yet    
 which has  nourishment. For example;  
 Chilli con carne which you buy in     
 packets, or chips and beefburger baps 
 from a deep freezer. Leisure eating   
 is eating in a posh restaurant or it  
 could be eating fish and chips in a   
 cafe.   Example, in a Chinese         
 restaurant a 3 course meal for 4      
 people would cost Â£25 to Â£30.Starter  
 :spare ribs, maincourse: prawn and    
 tomato, dessert: banana fritter.On    
 Sunday, everyone has a family meal of 
 Lamb, Pork, beef or Poultry for their 
 choice of meat. Peas, carrots or      
 cauliflower follow for vegetables.    
 Roast or boiled potatoes with gravy.  
 Fruit is nice with a cup of tea to    
 finish.                               </content>
