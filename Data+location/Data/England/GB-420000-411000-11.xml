		<title>11BURTON CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> Every summer Highburton and Kirkburton
 join together to celebrate Burton     
 Carnival. There is a procession of    
 decorated trucks and people in fancy  
 dress. On Saturday morning we         
 decorated the float and put a comfy   
 base on it ready for the afternoon    
 procession. Later on we put on our new
 clothes and paraded through the       
 village to the field where I, Rachel  
 Cruise was crowned Carnival Queen 1985
 by Lisa Mayor who was Carnival Queen  
 1984. I wore a pretty long white dress
 a long blue cloak and a crown. At the 
 Carnival field there are stalls and   
 events like the crowning of the Queen,
  a fancy dress parade and the brass   
 band playing. I presented people with 
 money for the best fancy dress        
 costumes and trophies for the best    
 decorated floats. It was a very       
 enjoyable day.                        </content>
