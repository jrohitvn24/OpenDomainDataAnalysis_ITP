		<title>07POPULATION OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THE TYPES
 OF POPULATIONS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF
 THE MIX OF TRULY RURAL AND LARGE      
 VILLAGE COMMUNITIES.                  
 THE TENANT FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS   
 REPRESENT THE ESSENTIALLY SIMPLISTIC  
 WAY OF LIFE WITH ITS RELAXED, EASY    
 MANNER. ON THE OTHER HAND THE LARGE   
 VILLAGE COMMUNITY OF SPRATTON MAY BE  
 DESCRIBED AS ESSENTIALLY SUBURBAN IN  
 MANY WAYS SINCE IT CONTAINS SEVERAL   
 PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR     
 OCCUPATIONS IN NORTHAMPTON OR OTHER   
 AREAS IN THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS. THESE
 PEOPLE ARE NOT GENERALLY TRUE COUNTRY 
 FOLK.                                 
 MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 30 TO 60 AGE
 BRACKET GENERALLY BELONG TO THE MIDDLE
 CLASS, WHILST THE OLDER ONES ARE      
 MAINLY OF WORKING CLASS EXTRACTION BUT
 ARE OFFICIALLY CLASSIFIED AS OLD AGE  
 PENSIONERS.THERE ARE MANY OF 80 YEARS.</content>
