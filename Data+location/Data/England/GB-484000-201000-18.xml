		<content>There is more variety in first names of
1985 than there was in 1881. Spellings 
of girls names varies more than boys in
both groups.  Families in 1985 are much
smaller than those of 1881. In 1881 the
largest household was at the Vicarage. 
Our School Log book of 1892 records    
that a boy was locked in a cupboard for
the whole day without food for         
"insubordination". The last time a cane
was used at P.M.S. was in 1962.        
Punishment today is usually extra work 
or loss of playtime or a telling off.  
School attendance in the 1890's and    
early 1900's was very low during       
harvest time as the children worked in 
the fields. Most children were working 
by the time they were 13. A few became 
Monitors at the school. In our area    
girls were often Straw  plaiters, and  
boys worked on the land. A few boys    
were apprenticed to Master craftsmen.  </content>
