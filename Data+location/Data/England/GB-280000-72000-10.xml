		<title>10A DAY IN MY LIFE(10Year old)</title>
		<content> My name is {Erica Brown,}I live near  
{Coldeast}and I am 10 years old. On a  
 normal Saturday morning I get up at   
 about 8'o clock and put on my horse   
 riding clothes. Then I go downstairs, 
 brush my hair and go outside to feed  
 my rabbit. After I have fed him I go  
 inside and have my breakfast. For     
 breakfast I have coco pops,they are a 
 popular breakfast cereal at the       
 moment. At about 8:30 my mum or dad   
 get back from town and take my sister 
 and I to the stables. The stables are 
 called Smallacombe stables.We get     
 there about 8:50 and go to groom the  
 ponies. When we have finished we groom
 some of the horses and we go out for a
 ride at 10:00, we go out for an hour  
 on the moor. When we come back my mum 
 or dad take me home but my sister     
 stays there all day. When I get home I
 go outside and play on the apple tree </content>
