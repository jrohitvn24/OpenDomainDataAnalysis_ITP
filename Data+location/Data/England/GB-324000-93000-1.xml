		<title>01THE COLYTON AREA</title>
		<content> Colyton is a small, ancient town in   
 rural East Devon. Its population was  
 2422 in 1981. It lies on the Coly,    
 a tributary of the River Axe, which   
 flows into the sea about 3 miles to   
 the south. Colyton was first settled  
 in early Saxon times and the town has 
 developed slowly, but continuously,   
 since then. Its narrow winding        
 streets, many of them with high walls 
 on each side, and the larger open     
 squares contain beautiful examples of 
 many kinds of architecture. The Parish
 Church of St Andrew, with its unusual 
 octagonal lantern tower, dominates    
 the town. The Feoffees, established   
 in the 16th century to buy back lands 
 from Henry VIII, still meet in the    
 Feoffees' Town Hall. The surrounding  
 area depends heavily on dairy         
 farming and is very attractive with   
 its rolling hills and deep valleys.   </content>
