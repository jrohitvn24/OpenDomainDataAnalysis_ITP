		<title>04Shrewsbury Council Tip.</title>
		<content>   The Council Tip at Betton Abbots    
 caters for all of Shrewsbury and      
 Atcham Borough District.It covers 47  
 acres but they only use 23.A long time
 ago the Tip was a Kettle Hole which   
 turned into a peat bog with willow    
 trees growing in it.It was taken      
 over by the Council in 1978 and a     
 tractor was soon lost in the bog.It   
 was then dug out by a Dragline.       
   About 100 lorries arrive with       
 rubbish every day.They pay Â£2.76      
 per ton to an office at the gate.It   
 is squashed by a compactor which is   
 like a bulldozer with spikes on its   
 wheels.The rubbish is buried in layers
 two metres thick with a thin layer of 
 soil between each. Four people work   
 here full time.They have a shower room
 and a tea break room.                 
   Tomatoes,marrows,corgettes and      
 potatoes grow like weeds here.        </content>
