		<title>09Canvey - The Lake (4)</title>
		<content>  Schools on Canvey are to be allocated
 a section of the banks in which they  
 will be involved in annual wild life  
 and conservation presentations.This is
 part of the close liason between      
 schools  and the projects organisers  
 in a bid through education to lessen  
 the vandalism and rubbish dumping     
 although local residents are sceptical
 about this having much effect at      
 snakes bridge a rubbish black spot.   
 The changes are welcomed by the       
 residents some of which signed a      
 petition in 1983 demanding that       
 something  was done about the lake.   
 Two years later they appreciate       
 being able to see the water again now 
 that a lot of the reeds have been     
 cleared.Birds to be seen  on the lake 
 at the moment are mallards,           
 Aylesburys, Swans, Coots, Moorhens,   
 Pied Wagtails as visitors.            </content>
