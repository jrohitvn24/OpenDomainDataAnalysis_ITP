		<title>12Employment In Wash Common</title>
		<content> We surveyed the parents of our class  
 and found that most mothers and       
 fathers worked in an office.A few work
 in a factory or the micro chip        
 industry. Three work in a library ,   
 two in a bank, two in a shop, one in a
 hospital. We also surveyed 160 parents
 and discovered half work in Newbury , 
 10% in London and Reading, 5% in      
 Thatcham and 5% in Aldermaston. The   
 rest travel to towns and villages in  
 about a 20 mile radius of Newbury. We 
 looked at this week's local paper and 
 found 165 job vacancies. The majority 
 were in offices,9 in factories and 7  
 in shops. The rest were in a wide     
 range of jobs.Unemployment in the     
 Newbury area which includes Wash      
 Common is 8%.
