		<title>07Bardon Hill Quarry</title>
		<content>  Opened in 1854, the{quarry}now       
 provides work for 123 people, although
 it used to be 700 before the          
 introduction of specialist machinery. 
 The quarry  produces 5,000-6,000 tons 
 of stone per day, ranging from 5cm    
 pieces to a fine dust.{Blasting}takes 
 place about three times a week. The   
 quarry has permission to operate      
 for another fifty years.The quarry    
 owns about 200 {vehicles}of different 
 types for transporting, dumping,      
 digging, lifting and compressing. The 
 drivers need special training to drive
 the vehicles. Most of the stone is    
 transported by{road}but 15% goes by   
{rail.}There is a railway siding up to 
 the quarry. My house is in front of   
 the railway. The old steam loco called
 Black Bess is now in a museum but a   
 diesel called the Duke of Edinburgh   
 now pulls the trucks up the line.     </content>
