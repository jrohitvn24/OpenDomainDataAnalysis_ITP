		<title>14 A  Day With a Fisherman</title>
		<content>    On Monday the 19th of May(1985)I   
 went on a day fishing trip with one of
 Seaton's fishermen, called Mr.Ziemann.
    We  started from Axmouth Harbour   
 at 6.40am!                            
    Mr.Ziemann took the boat about 5   
 miles out to sea to a place called    
 Witches Way and at 7.50am he started  
 to trawl for fish.At 9.00am the trawl 
 caught on a big rock on the sea bed so
 Mr.Ziemann brought the trawl up.Inside
 were fish,crabs and one lobster.      
 Mr.Ziemann put back into the sea all  
 the fish and crabs that were too      
 small, he then put the trawl back     
 into the sea.                         
    At 12.05pm the trawl was brought in
 again, he put  the small fish and     
 crabs back into the sea again and     
 began trawling once more. At 1.35pm   
 Mr.Ziemann started preparing the fish 
 for sale and fish for crab pots.      </content>
