		<title>16Education in Nibley.</title>
		<content> North Nibley primary school was closed
 during part of June because the toilet
 block could not be used.The school is 
 a church aided school and the exterior
 repairs are being paid for by the     
 county.At the moment there are        
 arguments as to who is responsible for
 paying for the repairs needed.        
 Portaloos were installed at the time  
 but there was still the question of   
 the cost.The parents did not mind the 
 children having time off in relation  
 to inconveniencing their work,because 
 it is a pleasant and social area to   
 live in with everyone willing to help 
 friends.The school itself employs 4   
 teachers and has 64 pupils.The        
 teachers are of varied religions but  
 the church has no objections.The      
 school has the use of peripatetic     
 music teachers and mother helpers.
