		<content> IN OUR AREA THERE ARE 4 SUB POST      
 OFFICES AND 15 WALL AND PILLAR BOXES. 
 ONE SUB POST OFFICE IS QUITE NEAR TO  
 OUR SCHOOL SO WE INTERVIEWED THE SUB  
 POST MASTER. HE SAID THAT THE SUB POST
 OFFICE HAD BEEN CONVERTED FROM A      
 PRIVATE HOUSE IN 194O AND HE HAD      
 WORKED THERE WITH ONE PART-TIME       
 ASSISTANT FOR THE LAST 18 YEARS. HE   
 SAID HE WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT      
 ROBBERY AND BURGLARY AND THAT SINCE HE
 HAD TAKEN OVER THERE HAD BEEN ONE CASE
 OF ROBBERY THERE. HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO
 TELL US HOW MUCH MONEY PASSED THROUGH 
 THE OFFICE BUT IN THE LAST 1O YEARS   
 THE WELFARE STATE AND THE GIRO BANK   
 HAD INCREASED THE WORK CONSIDERABLY,  
 THE BUSIEST SERVICE BEING THE PAYMENT 
 OF PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
