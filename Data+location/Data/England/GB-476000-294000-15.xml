		<title>15HALLATON BOTTLE-KICKING 2</title>
		<content>  After this, everyone parades to the  
 Butter Cross to decorate the Bottles  
 with red, white and blue ribbons. The 
 bottles are in fact three casks - one 
 full of beer, and two dummies. The    
 parade makes its way to the top of the
 hill outside the village called "Hare 
 Pie Bank" where the rest of the pie is
 thrown to the crowd. The custodian of 
 the bottles begins the bottle kicking 
 contest between the youths of Hallaton
 and Medbourne - and elsewhere. He     
 throws one of the bottles in the air  
 three times and on the third time they
 scramble, quite violently on          
 occasions, until it is carried over   
 one of the two brooks which mark the  
 boundaries of the contest. The winners
 - the first to "home" two bottles -   
 usually Medbourne these days - carry  
 the casks to the Butter Cross and     
 drink the beer.                       </content>
