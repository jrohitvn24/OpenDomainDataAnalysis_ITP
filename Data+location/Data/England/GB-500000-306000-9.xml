		<content> Stamford is a very old town, and its  
 housing patterns reflect its periods  
 of change and growth. The centre of   
 the town has old stone houses dating  
 back many centuries reflectng         
 Stamford's prosperity as a woolen     
 market centre during the middle ages. 
 There was much development in         
 Victorian times as some industry moved
 to Stamford. This is mainly in the NE 
 of the town, although there is also   
 some prosperous development in the    
 west of the town. We think the bosses 
 must have lived there!                
 There is some Edwardian development in
 patches but the major period of growth
 has been since the 1960s in large     
 housing estates on the west of the    
 town. There is also some 1940s-       
 council housing, due to the           
 development of Peterborough as a local
 centre for jobs.                      </content>
