		<title>01Uplands and Marsh Near Rye</title>
		<content> The area, lying partly in the Sussex  
 Parishes of Playden, Iden and East    
 Guildford and the Kent Parish of      
 Brookland is agricultural.  It is     
 divided into two parts by the River   
 Rother which flows towards Rye.  To   
 the East &amp; North of the River the     
 reclaimed marshland is flat &amp; low-    
 lying, almost at sea level.  It       
 contains a network of sea defence     
 embankments called "innings" and      
 ditches called "sewers" outfalling to 
 the River or Royal Military Canal     
 which joins the River at Iden Lock. To
 the west of the River the land rises  
 to the Uplands reaching 150 feet above
 sea level via a steep sandstone cliff.
 In the uplands there is mixed farming.
 The reclaimed marshland is used for   
 arable crops &amp; sheep. Traversing the  
 marsh is a single track railway line  
 connecting Rye to Ashford.            </content>
