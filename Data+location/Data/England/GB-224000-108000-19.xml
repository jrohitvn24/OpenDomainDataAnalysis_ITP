		<content> Just about everyone in this area is   
 forced to run a car, as the bus       
 service is so poor. A bus for shoppers
 to the market town of Holsworthy,     
 operates once a week, allowing them   
 about one and three quarter hours     
 there before returning. There is also 
 a bus to Bideford on a tuesday. These 
 last two services pick up passengers  
 on the main A39 only without detours. 
 The nearest railway is the branch line
 from Barnstaple to the main line at   
 Exeter.
