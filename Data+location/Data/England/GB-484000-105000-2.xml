		<content>  With it's proximity to the sea, times
 past  have  seen {Chichester }closely 
 linked with smugglers &amp;their exploits.
 The {"Smuggler's Stone",} Broyle Road 
 tells of the burial near the stone of 
 William Jackson a smuggler,who died a 
 few hours after sentence of death was 
 pronounced  upon  him. The{ Smuggler's
{Stone }was  erected  "as a memorial to
 posterity  and  a warning to this and 
 succeeding generations _ AD 1749". The
 smugglers of {Sussex }were  incredibly
 daring &amp; numerous. They openly  defied
 the law &amp; many stories remain of their
 exploits. {Brandy Hole Lane,}now  a   
 residential road, is said  to be named
 after  it's association with smuggling
 days _ the hiding place of the brandy!
 Smugglers' trials  were  held  in  the
{Guildhall,Chichester.}Upon sentence of
 death, executions were  carried out on
{The Broyle,}now  a  residential  area.</content>
