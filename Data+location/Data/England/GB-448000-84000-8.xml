		<content> The settlement at{Chillerton}ribbons  
 the road running north to Newport down
 the valley where once the open brook  
 ran. There is still a ford leading to 
 cottages by{Sheat Manor.}This fine    
 stone-built E-shaped Elizabethan      
 house dates from 1605. About 60 people
 live in old cottages or new bungalows 
 built high on the banks by the road.  
 The Methodist Chapel is near the Post 
 Office Stores. The red brick Victorian
 gabled school was built in l883.

{Chillerton Beauty }Many years ago a   
 passing Botanist took a cutting from a
 fuchsia in the garden of an empty cot-
 tage at the top of Hill Lane. It is   
 now in the National Fuchsia Catologue 
 as Chillerton Beauty. The Parish Coun-
 cil would like to protect the original
 bush by a Protection Order.
