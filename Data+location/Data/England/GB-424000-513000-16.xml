		<title>16HOUSES IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content>  Years ago this part of Darlington was
 country with country houses and farms 
 owned by the wealthy families of the  
 town.                                 
      Down Pierrmont Road the houses   
 were built about the 1920s to 30s they
 are mostly semi-detached. There are no
 gardens in the back they are all back 
 lanes.                                
       Near the Methodist church in    
 Cockerton the houses are very old they
 were built in the beginning of the    
 nineteenth century. The houses dont   
 have any gardens but they do have back
 lanes.Some of the houses are terraced.
       Most of the houses along        
 Staindrop Road are pre-war they are   
 semi-detached and have front and back 
 gardens.Towards the edge of town the  
 houses are very modern (Post-war) and 
 semi-detached and have fairly big     
 front and rear gardens.               </content>
