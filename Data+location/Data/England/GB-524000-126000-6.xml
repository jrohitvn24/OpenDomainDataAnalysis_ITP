		<title>06SHOPS AND SHOPPING</title>
		<content>    The last two remaining shops in the
 area closed down some years ago owing 
 to lack of customers.A small shop has 
 survived in Staplefield and this is   
 run on a voluntary basis by people in 
 the village.It opens from 2 to 5 pm   
 each day and any profits go towards   
 the village.Most grocery items are    
 sold &amp; customers are pleased it's     
 there.A mobile shop also tours the    
 area.                                 
  There is a small nursery in Slaugham 
 selling plants,&amp; a very large garden  
 centre situated just off the          
 northbound carriageway of the A23.A   
 few farms sell produce like eggs &amp;    
 vegetables but apart from this most   
 shopping is done outside the area ,   
 mainly in Crawley &amp; Haywards Heath.   
 Most people have one main shopping    
 trip to one of the above towns each   
 week.                                 </content>
