		<title>18RECREATION: HORSE RIDING</title>
		<content>{ALLENDALE HORSE RANGERS CENTRE.       
{   }Allendale is a member of the Horse
 Rangers Association. It is also       
 mentioned on the "Woodland" page. It  
 is owned by Mr.and Mrs.G.P.Allen.     
     Horse Rangers' National           
 Headquarters are at Hampton Court, in 
 Surrey, where there are various events
 to which people come from all over the
 country. Behind the stable there is a 
 very old barn in which they serve     
 refreshments and hold functions to    
 raise money for the charity. Outside a
 balcony overlooks a paddock where they
 have displays and teach beginners. In 
 the summer they go for picnic rides   
 to Brighstone Forest and the beach.   
 The more experienced Rangers ride in  
 the copse or the moor but keep to the 
 paths so as not to disturb the        
 wildlife. "Mucking out" and general   
 chores keeps the cost of riding down. </content>
