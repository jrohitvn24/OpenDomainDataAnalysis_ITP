We went to school in the old Art Centre.  Mr Blogg was the head and he had a room in the middle of the school up some very imposing steps.  It was a long narrow room and as I remember always cluttered.  If you were summoned to that room you may very well receive the cane!  The loos were outside and revolting,  I always waited until I could go home.  We always went home for lunch and it was the main meal of the day.  During morning break we had a small bottle of milk, sometimes,(my favourite)so cold it had small pieces of ice in it and sometimes luke warm  as it had sat in the sun. I remember the teachers Miss Newberry, very kind,  Mr Jenkins who threw chalk at you if you were not paying attention and Miss Matrevers .   &lt;br />
