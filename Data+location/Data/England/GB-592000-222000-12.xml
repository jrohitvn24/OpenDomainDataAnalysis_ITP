		<title>12A YOUNG VIEW OF COPFORD</title>
		<content>{ Copford's}all right - there are lots 
 of things to do - if you join clubs.  
 Older people seem to have a lot of    
 activities to do.                     
  There are not many places to go and  
 relax especially for the young. It    
 would be nice to have a decent        
 playingfield.                         
  It is easy to get to larger places   
 for shopping or entertainment.{Bus    
{services and the trains}are good and  
 we are not far away from the sea.     
  There is only one{shop}which is a    
 small{general stores.}You would think 
 in a place like Copford there would be
 more. I expect when I leave school I  
 will have to find a job in            
 Colchester.It's a good place to live.
