		<title>02LAND USE AROUND OGBOURNE</title>
		<content> Around Ogbourne St Andrew the land is 
 used mainly for{arable farming.}The   
 main crops grown are wheat barley and 
 oats.A lot of land is used for grazing
 cattle, particularly around Southend, 
 and the northern part of the area is  
 primarily used for{intensively managed
{grassland.}In the west of the area,   
 around Rockley, there are{plantations 
{of trees,}mostly deciduous.Along the  
 River Og there are some patches of    
 water_meadowland.                     
 The farms are highly mechanised, using
 modern machinery such as combine      
 harvesters, tractors, ploughs and     
 seed_drills.The wheat and barley grown
 on the farms are high_yielding        
 varieties, sprayed with pesticides,   
 insecticides and fungicides, so       
 producing better quality crops.
