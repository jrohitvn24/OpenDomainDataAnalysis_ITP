		<title>09LIFE ON ST.MICHAEL'S MOUNT</title>
		<content> People on the Mount are employed      
 working as staff or guides in the     
 castle and grounds. Some are boatmen  
 who take people across to the mainland
 at high tide. The children who live on
 the Mount have a room to meet in and a
 tennis court.                         
 On the harbour is a National Trust    
 shop, a cinema for slide shows and a  
 cafe for the many people who walk     
 across the causeway to visit the      
 Mount and the castle.                 
 There is a piped water supply from    
 the mainland and a well of fresh water
 which is still used if there is a     
 water shortage.                       
 The Mount is a Coastguard Station.    
 A tunnel with an underground railway  
 runs from the harbour to the castle   
 and is used to take food, stores, etc.
 up to the castle.
