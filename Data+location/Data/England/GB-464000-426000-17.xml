		<content> Camblesforth Feast                    
                                       
 Camblesforth Feast was held annually. 
 Every year a girl from our school was 
 chosen to be the Queen together with  
 some attendants. The Feast was held on
 the school field. There was quite a   
 variety of activities including       
 floats, stalls and games, sports and  
 refreshments, and entertainments.     
 There was a welly throwing            
 competition, pony rides and races.    
 The Feast always started with a       
 procession of floats through the      
 village led by a band. Children       
 processed in fancy dress and there was
 a competition.                        
 Camblesforth Feast has not been held  
 for the last two years because of lack
 of support.
