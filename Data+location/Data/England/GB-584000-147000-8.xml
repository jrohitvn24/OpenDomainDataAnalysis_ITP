		<content> In and around Ulcombe traffic is light
 and it never realy gets busy.There are
 few buses because there are not many  
 people to pick up!{Traffic is slow}   
 because there are lots of bends in the
 roads and people like to look at the{ 
{beautiful}countryside.Drivers are kind
 to horses and ponies,which often ride 
 around here.Lorries often drive up and
 down{Ulcombe}hill,and there are a lot 
 of tractors as well.A few{motorbikes} 
 travel down here but not many.We have 
 a{school bus}every Monday to take us  
 to the swimming baths.The busiest time
 is about{3:30pm}when we are being     
 picked up from school.                
     As there is not much industry in  
 our D block.Bus routes are scarce,only
 three buses stop every day.In and near
 Grafty Green only two run through and 
 stop,one in the morning and one in the
 afternoon.                            </content>
