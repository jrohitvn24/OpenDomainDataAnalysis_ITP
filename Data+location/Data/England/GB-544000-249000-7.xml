		<title>07Halls Farm</title>
		<content> The history of the farm started in the
 1800's when the father of the present 
 farmer began to build the farm up.It  
 was a small farm which had two other  
 farms beside it,which were called the 
 Rectory farm and the Whites' farm.When
 the farms were being sold he bought   
 them making it a much bigger farm.When
 he died,he gave the farm to his son   
 who is now the present owner.Unluckily
 there is no-one to carry on the job of
 being the farmer of Halls farm when   
 he dies,so it will have to be sold.The
 farm is mainly arable,consisting of   
 503 acres which has three permanent   
 farm hands.                           
 The crops that are produced are winter
 barley and winter soil rape which is  
 sent to the crushes and then sold as  
 margarine etc.In summer they harvest  
 the crops using two combines.(For rest
