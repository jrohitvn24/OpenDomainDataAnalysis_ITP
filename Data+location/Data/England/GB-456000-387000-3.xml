		<content> On{Tuesday 2nd}of{July}breakfast was  
 tinned pineapple and pineapple juice. 
 After that I walked upstairs and      
 cleaned my teeth. I then carried my   
 heavy bags up the road to catch the   
 school bus. It soon came and took me  
 to school in{Woodsetts }where I would 
 hope to get a good days work done but 
 that was before I had remembered that 
 we were having {Assembly. Assembly    
 today is where people go to tell      
 everybody something special. School   
 soon ended after a fairly  good days  
 work mostly copying up and soon I was 
 boarding the school bus. I arrived {  
{home}about{4.00pm}to a{Italian}meal of
 spaghetti bolognaise because Ihad only
 had sandwiches for lunch. I watched   
{television}as my mum drove off to {   
{Tesco}(a big supermarket). Before I   
 went to bed I had a drink of{milk }and
 a {Kit Kat.}But soon I went to bed.   </content>
