		<content> We visited the old {Courtauld Mill}on 
 July 12 1985.We met Mr.Kaln who is    
 going to be the manager and  is the   
 chief  builder as well as owning the  
 place. He said that he wanted to have 
 a restaurant,antiques and an art and  
 craft shop.They are going to serve all
 sorts of foods on the ground floor.On 
 the first floor there will be garden  
 ware,on the second art and craft goods
 and on the top floor just antiques.   
 The walls are still criss_crossed     
 with the original Corsican Pine which 
 is about 300 years old. We also saw   
 the original water wheel which will be
 installed in the new restaurant. There
 is a simple crane which is as old as  
 the mill.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
