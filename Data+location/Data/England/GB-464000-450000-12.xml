		<content>   In{1865}at the crossroads in        
 Dunnington the primary school was     
 built.The children went to school at  
 the age of five.Some left school at   
 eleven to go to a grammar school in   
 York and until 1963 the rest stayed at
 the village school until they were    
 fifteen and went to work.             
   In 1969 a{new school}was built      
 because the Victorian school was too  
 small. The upper juniors stayed in the
 Victorian part and five to nines went 
 to the new building. There were only  
 three classes to begin with and one   
 playground. Now in 1985 there are 230 
 children on roll. There is a head     
 teacher and eight others. In 1986 the 
 Victorian building will probably be   
 closed.{At eleven}most Dunnington     
 children travel by bus five miles to  
 Fulford Comprehensive School.
