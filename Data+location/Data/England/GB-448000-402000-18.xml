		<title>18Schools in Barnburgh</title>
		<content>     Parish records show that there was
 a school in Barnburgh in 1740, and    
 there some evidence of earlier        
 educational establishments.           
     In 1840 a National School was set 
 up, which survived as a school until  
 1878,and as building until 1912. A    
 Board School was built in 1878,which  
 served the needs of the village until 
 1956. The building is now             
 demolished,but the Headmaster's house 
 still stands. Village expansion       
 resulted in a new school being built  
 in 1956,which had peak population of  
 250 in  1975. Today the school has    
 some 200 children aged 5 to 12,       
 arranged in 8 classes.                
     As we sit infront of our B.B.C.   
 Micro typing in this page of          
 information we can imagine the great  
 changes that have occurred since 1740.
