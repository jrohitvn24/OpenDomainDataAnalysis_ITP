		<content> In 1985 public sector developments    
 have practically ceased, due to lack  
 of funds, although the Council does   
 provide sheltered schemes for the eld-
 erly. The recently formed Housing     
 Association builds for those people   
 with limited cash, filling a slot bet-
 ween the private and public sector.   
 The figures for new building in the   
 1980's are: private sector 93%, public
 sector 4.5%, Housing Association 2.5%.
 Darley Abbey, Little Chester, Friar-  
 gate and Markeaton are Conservation   
 Areas where houses of historic or     
 architectural interest are protected. 
 In 1980 the tenure figures for the    
 wards of Darley, Mackworth &amp; Abbey    
 were: owner occupied 6647, council    
 houses 4326, Housing Assn. 472, other 
 rented accommodation 1643. By 1985,   
 1250 council houses in Mackworth had  
 been sold to tenants.                 </content>
