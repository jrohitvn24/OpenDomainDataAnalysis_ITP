		<content>  The best Known legend around Kington 
 is Black Vaughan of Hergest. He was   
 Thomas Vaughan and he lived at Hergest
 Court. Thomas was killed at The Battle
 of Banbury in 1469. Kington people    
 were tormented by his ghost. His      
 spirit grew stronger, then he entered 
 St. Mary's church as a Hereford bull. 
 People were afraid of Black Vaughan.  
 The number of people in Kington market
 dropped. His spirit was reduced more  
 than once. He was put in a snuff box  
 "good and true" with a bell, book and 
 candle. Then it was thrown into       
 Hergest Court moat.                   
  The Court is still haunted by a demon
 dog which used to belong to him. The  
 demon dog was probably used in the    
 novel "Hound of the Baskerville". The 
 Baskervilles owned Eardisley Castle   
 and were related to the Vaughans.
