		<title>03FARMING AND FERTILLIZERS.</title>
		<content> Until about 20 years ago farmers      
 used very little fertilizer.Lots of   
 cow manure and horse manure were used.
 The fertilizers that were used were   
 basic slag and sulphate of ammonia    
 which were by products of steel       
 furnace.Not very much of these two    
 were used.Now we use many nitrogen    
 phosphate &amp; potash mixtures for       
 different  crops such as corn and     
 grass.                                
 All these fertilizers come from oil   
 nowadays.We also get sprays now to    
 kill weeds in corn like daisies,docks 
 &amp; thistles also to kill insects like  
 leather jackets,aphids.And we get     
 sprays to kill fungus diseases on the 
 leaves of the barley &amp; other corn but 
 we still use lots of cow manure.
