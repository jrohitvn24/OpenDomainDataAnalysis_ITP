		<title>14HOP GROWING AT TYLER HILL</title>
		<content>The hop garden is in the sheltered     
valley to the SE of Tyler Hill.        
Methods of growing,picking and drying  
have altered.Mechanisation has replaced
labour.Cobs and Canterbury Goldings are
the types grown here.Hops are trained  
on poles,wires and strings to grow at  
an angle to get maximum air and sun,   
and for ease in spraying to control    
pests and diseases.A worker still uses 
stilts to string the wires and poles,  
working 12 feet up between the         
rows.East- End Londoners               
used to hand pick the hop bines.A      
machine is now used. Hops are dried in 
oasthouses.Oil fired kilns with        
powerful fans dry the hops. Breweries  
use hops in the making of beer.The     
acreage has fallen from 52 to 20 since 
1945. Hops have been grown at Tyler    
Hill at least since 1860.
