		<title>05FARMING IN MILLAND</title>
		<content>  there are many farms in the southern 
 part of the block, but none in the    
 northern sandy area. the dairy herds  
 include one of guernseys selling milk 
 and cream locally, and several herds  
 of friesians selling to the milk      
 marketing board. there are also       
 smaller herds of beef cattle and one  
 for prize aberdeen angus bulls. the   
 land is much cultivated, the main     
 crops being wheat and barley, and some
 oil seed rape. very little hay is made
 nowadays from the grass it is mainly  
 silage. this year there is an         
 increasing number of sheep in the     
 valley. it is said that what the      
 farmers grow and keep depends to a    
 certain extent on what the ministry of
 agriculture is offering in grants.
