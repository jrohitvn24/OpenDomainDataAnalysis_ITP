		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF BICKLEIGH</title>
		<content> Bickleigh, population 200, is a       
 pleasant village on a busy road which 
 twists across a picturesque stone     
 bridge creating a scene attractive    
 enough to be found on chocolate boxes 
 and suitable for jigsaw puzzles. Sur- 
 rounded by rolling hills and far views
 of green and pleasant countryside, it 
 is small wonder that the inhabitants  
 feel very privileged, and that the    
 area is visited by thousands of       
 holidaymakers and tourists who wish to
 be refreshed by contact with a Britain
 long disappeared from{their}daily     
 lives. The inhabitants enjoy a quiet  
 rural pace with a strong sense of     
 community. Many are farmers with long 
 traditions and a great pride in       
 possession.
