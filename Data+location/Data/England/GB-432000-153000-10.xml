		<title>10Footpaths of Vernham Dean CP</title>
		<content>  The area is well served with         
 footpaths and bridleways and they are 
 all well used and well kept.          
  A favorite walk starts opposite the  
 old bakery in Vernham Dean and heads  
 south along a track to Thornycombe    
 Wood and thence to the derelict Lower 
 Conholt Farm. The path then descends  
 to Well Bottom before climbing to Cow 
 Down, with extensive views to the     
 south.                                
  The path then turns east and passes  
 the highest point before decending    
 Rushmore Down to the village of Upton 
 and the lowest point. The village also
 has the only pub in the area.         
  The return to Vernham Dean may be    
 made along the road or along tracks to
 the north of the area.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
