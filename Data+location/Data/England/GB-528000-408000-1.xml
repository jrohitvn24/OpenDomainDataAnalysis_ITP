		<content> The area lies on the south bank of the
 Humber estuary, in the County of      
 Humberside. Much of the land is flat  
 and was formerly marshland. Only on   
 the ridge which runs from west to east
 across the area in the south, ending  
 in a cliff overlooking the Humber,    
 does the land rise above the 10m      
 contour. Administratively the area is 
 divided between the towns of Grimsby  
 and Cleethorpes, although most        
 visitors would find it difficult to   
 see where one town ended and the other
 began.                                
 In the north east of the area lie the 
 Grimsby fish docks, now much less     
 prosperous than formerly. To the south
 east is the resort of Cleethorpes. In 
 the south west is a new industrial    
 area and, between that and            
 Cleethorpes, the "village" of Old     
 Clee.                                 </content>
