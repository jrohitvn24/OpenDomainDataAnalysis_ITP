		<title>16GAMES BETHAN AND PIPPA PLAY</title>
		<content>  We play lots of games together, these
 two are our favourites.{Block 123}is  
 a good game you need between four and 
 ten people. All you have to do is hide
 and the person who is on counts up to 
 one hundred or two hundred. When      
 they have counted up to it they say   
 "I'm coming"-so they all keep still.  
 When they have been found, one should 
 say "block 123" and the name of the   
 person you see.Another game is called{
{My Red Letter}its a game you can play 
 at home and at school.One person says 
 a letter and if the other people have 
 got it in their christian or surname  
 they move foward a step. If they said 
 a red letter and they moved and the   
 letter was not in their name they     
 would have to go back to the start.   
 The object of the game is to try to   
 reach the person calling out the      
 "red" letters.                        </content>
