		<content> I live in Avebury Manor. At 7.15 each 
 morning my Dad gets me up. I go to the
 bathroom and get dressed and make my  
 Mum a cup of tea. My Mum gets up at 8 
 o'clock and makes Neville and me      
 breakfast. By this time my Dad is at  
 his business. My Mum takes Nev and me 
 over to school.At school we work very 
 hard. After school the gardener often 
 takes us home. When we get home       
 Neville and me go out on our bikes    
 although sometimes we play with my    
 swingball, after that its time for    
 tea. We watch television while we eat 
 our food with my Mum and Dad. When my 
 sister Cherie and brother Simon come  
 home Mum and Dad sometimes take us    
 swimming in Marlborough. Often they   
 take us to play tennis in Marlborough.
 It is great fun when my sister and    
 brother come home because they take   
 us on long bike rides.                </content>
