		<content> The present headmaster has been head  
 of Hanwood Primary School since it was
 built 16 years ago. The current       
 building was built to amalgamate the  
 village schools of Lea Cross,         
 Cruckmeole and Hanwood.The Headmaster 
 stated his main aim for the education 
 of the children in his school is:"{To 
{help them to understand the world in  
{which they live and develop their     
{personality and skills to the full."  
                                       
 The Headmaster of Hanwood Primary     
 School is responsible to The          
 Shropshire Education Committee and the
 school Governors.The Head stated that 
 the most difficult part of being a    
 Headteacher is providing all the      
 necessary equipment and books on a    
 limited amount of money.
