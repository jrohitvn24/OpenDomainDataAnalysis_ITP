		<content> The hamlet of Ickornshaw is very      
 ancient and its history goes back     
 centuries.The name means"Acorn Wood". 
 The most important building in the    
 hamlet is the {Wesleyan Methodist     
{Chapel,}which was built in 1875.Many  
 famous people have come to take       
 part in services when special musical 
 performances have been given such as  
{Handel's"Messiah"}It is now closed.   
 Another interesting house is called   
 Freegate,which is where there used to 
 be a toll-booth.Opposite this used to 
 be the Black Bull Hotel,which is now  
 on the main road.There are two        
 cottages near the beckside which have 
 been lived in for over 200 years.The  
 people who own houses  in Ickornshaw  
 have had shooting rights on the local 
 moor for hundreds of years.It is said 
 to be the only moor in England with   
 these rights for householders.        </content>
