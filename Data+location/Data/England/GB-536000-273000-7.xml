		<title>07SHOPPING SURVEY</title>
		<content> We went into the village to interview 
 people on what{facilities}they would  
 like in{Earith.}The majority wanted a 
{big store}followed by a{chemist}which 
 is probably because the nearest one is
 five miles away. The same amount of   
 people also think that the{pavements  
 could be improved.Some people think a 
{greengrocers,}a{bank}and a{tow path } 
 along the river are required.         
 Our next survey was to see which      
 village{facilities are used}.We found 
 most people use the{Post Office.}Out  
 of the two{public houses }most people 
 prefer the Riverview Inn.The{antique  
{shop}was used the least,whereas about 
 50% of the people use the{surgery,}   
{butchers, Jewsons}and{Banklins  }     
 (freezer centre). Some shops aren't   
 used so much because their goods      
 aren't as necessary as food.
