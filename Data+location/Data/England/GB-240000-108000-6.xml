 years. He has three or four services  
 on a Sunday. He is in charge of       
 Shebbear, Langtree, Buckland Filleigh,
 Newton st. Petrock and Sheepwash. On a
 Sunday he takes Holy Communion and    
 Morning Prayer. He became a priest    
 because he felt God was calling him.  
 He also is a special constable and    
 spends about 10 hours a month mostly  
 in a police car. The parish that takes
 up most of his time is Shebbear. In   
 1984 he had 3 weddings, 3 funerals,   
 and 5 baptisms. He has 4 lay readers  
 to help him preach. The average       
 congregation on a Sunday is 25-30     
 people. The church that has the       
 biggest congregation is Shebbear. He  
 has to visit people, keep the church  
 clock going, look up records, and take
 meetings.
