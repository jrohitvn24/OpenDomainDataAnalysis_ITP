 There has been residential building   
 around these villages,restricted to a 
 high priced market.The village houses 
 &amp; period cottages are sought after,a  
 serious handicap to the continuation  
 of family life,the young people have  
 to move out to buy their own homes.   
 There are a few Council houses at Wol-
 verton &amp; several rented houses,people 
 come to live for limited times.Some   
 farm-owners are running their large   
 farms from afar so that decisions such
 as hedge removing are made for        
 economic reasons not for the good of  
 the area as a whole.Boundary Oaks have
 been planted by a local man.Many      
 hedges went through Dutch Elm Disease 
 &amp; were not re-planted.The general     
 atmosphere is one of well-being the   
 houses are beautifully kept,the fields
 are continually planted &amp; productive. </content>
