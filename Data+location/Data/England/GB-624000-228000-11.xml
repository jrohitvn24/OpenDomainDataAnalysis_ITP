		<title>11Jobs in Dovercourt- at sea</title>
		<content> Dovercourt is by the sea and next to  
 this holiday town are the docks of    
 Parkeston and Harwich. These docks and
 the Port of Harwich generate many jobs
 for those living in Dovercourt. Some  
 jobs are mainly based at sea,         
 while others are at the docks         
 themselves.                           
  Harwich and Parkeston are kept busy  
 by a constant flow of continental     
 ferries to and from Denmark and       
 Holland. Many men work on             
 these boats as crew. Some help to run 
  the coffee shop and duty free shop.  
 Others are engineers.  These men are  
 often at sea for several weeks at a   
 time. When the boats arrive many of   
 the women from the area go on board to
 clean.  Some men are employed by      
 Trinity House to act as pilots. They  
 help boats enter and leave port       
 safely.                               </content>
