		<title>07TRAVELLING IN HOATH</title>
		<content> If you have not got a car it is very  
 difficult to travel unless you get a  
 taxi or a bus but the problem is there
 aren't many buses going through Hoath.
 There are only 2 in the morning and 3 
 buses on the afternoon                
 .On Saturdays there are 2 buses,1 in  
 the morning at 10.16 and 1 in the     
 afternoon comingback at 12.45 and     
 there are not any buses on Sundays.   
 .Sometimes buses go early and people  
 get to the bus stop on time and the   
 bus has gone.                         
                                       
 The nearest railway stations are at   
 Herne Bay,and Sturry.From Herne Bay   
 station one way goes to London the    
 opposite way goes to Margate.Sturry   
 station goes to Ashford,Maidstone and 
 London and the opposite way goes to   
 Aylesham and Dover.
