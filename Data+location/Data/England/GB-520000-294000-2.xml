		<title>02Development of Fenland</title>
		<content>  More than half of our area is covered
 in fenland.The ground is very flat and
 Farcet stands on a ridge of higher    
 griund about sixty feet above the     
 fields.Before the fen was drained,    
 there was marshy,swampy ground near   
 the village.This was rich in bird life
 and many fish swam in the muddy       
 water.The higher,stoney ridge was a   
 dry route between{Yaxley}and{         
{Stanground.}                          
   The fen is formed of peat and began 
 to be drained in the early seventeenth
 century with the dutchman{Cornelius   
{Vermuyden}as engineer, and continued  
 at intervals until about a century    
 ago, when Farcet Fen was fully        
 drained.The drainage and shrinking of 
 the peat makes the level of fields    
 low.                                  
   The{Pig Water}gives water access to 
 other parts of the country.           </content>
