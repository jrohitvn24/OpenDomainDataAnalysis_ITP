		<content> In our area there are three churches  
 The Christian Community Chapel,St     
 Dominic's and St George's.The         
 Christian Community Chapel is a free  
 church.It is run partly by donations  
 from local people and partly by a     
 goverment grant given to the chapel   
 because it looks after old people and 
 does general community work.          
 St Dominic's is a Roman Catholic      
 church.It is run by donations and can 
 expect to take about Â£200.00 a        
 week,from an average congregation of  
 350 people at a busy Sunday Mass      
 (Service).there are over 1,100 people 
 registered in it's parish,however not 
 all of these are regular church       
 attenders.Some of them may attend     
 church once or twice a year or on     
 special occasions such as             
 weddings,funerals or baptisms.
