		<title>16Do we like our housing ?</title>
		<content>  A  survey carried out among adults in
 our block  produced  these ideas about
 changes which have occured in housing.
 Many people appreciate  modern designs
 in recent Council and  private housing
 from aesthetic and  practical aspects.
 Others thought that developers crammed
 too many dwellings into small spaces. 
 Generally people were not in favour of
 large estates being built on the outer
 edges  of  Birkenhead  because of the 
 destruction of long established local 
 communities  and  the  problems  that 
 result from such development.         
  Those who were in favour of rehousing
 people from  the  older  areas to new 
 housing estates suggested that leisure
 centres, libraries etc should be built
 as integral  parts of such  schemes in
 order to provide a  sense of community
 and ample recreational  opportunities.
