		<content> St. Martin's Church of England is     
 one of the four churches in           
 Knebworth. It was designed by Sir     
 Edward Lutyens and built in 1915. The 
 present Rector is the Reverend Roger  
 James. He has been with the church for
 three years and he takes services     
 during the week. There are three      
 services on Sundays and a morning and 
 evening prayers on weekdays. There is 
 no choir at the moment but they are   
 hoping to start one soon. The Church  
 runs a youth and social club as well  
 as a Sunday School.                   
                                       
 The Methodist Church in Knebworth was 
 built in 1965 on the foundations of   
 the previous temporary building. The  
 Church belongs to the circuit of      
 churches which includes the districts 
 of Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage.
