		<title>17THE DUCHY OF CORNWALL</title>
		<content> THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR THE     
 LOCAL RESIDENTS OF THE AREA IN THE    
 PAST, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE     
 PRESENT AND PERHAPS THE FUTURE IS THE 
{DUCHY OF CORNWALL.}THE DUCHY IS BY FAR
 THE{GREATEST LAND OWNER,}AND IS       
 DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
 THE LIVELIHOOD OF MANY OF THE LOCAL   
 PEOPLE. THE{MAJORITY OF THE FARMS}ARE 
{DUCHY OWNED}AND WORKED BY TENNANT     
 FARMERS. FOR MANY YEARS NOW,THE OLDER 
{CORNISH RESIDENTS}HAVE THOUGHT OF     
 THEMSELVES AS BELONGING TO THE{DUCHY  
{VILLAGE AND}MANY OF THEM PAY THEIR    
 RENT TO THE DUCHY. MANY OF THESE      
 PEOPLE ARE PROUD POSSESSORS OF SOME   
 MOMENTO OF A{ROYAL VISIT.}WITH THE    
{DUCHY HOME FARM}NOW BEING USED AS AN  
{AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE,}AND THE{SALE OF 
{DUCHY LAND AND PROPERTY}IT IS FELT    
 BY MANY THAT THE{DUCHY CONNECTION}IS  
 IS BEING{WEAKENED AND PERHAPS, LOST.  </content>
