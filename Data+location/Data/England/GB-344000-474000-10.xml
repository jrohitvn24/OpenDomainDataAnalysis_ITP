		<content> THE MARSH                             
                                       
 There is a large area of salt marsh on
 the edge of Morecambe Bay. This has   
 been changing dramatically over the   
 past eight years. More than two-thirds
 of the grassland has been destroyed by
 the sea following a change in the     
 channel of the River Kent which now   
 flows just off Silverdale rather than 
 on the Grange side of the Bay.        
 The grassland is still used for       
 pasturing sheep but in much reduced   
 numbers and cutting of sea-washed turf
 for lawns has stopped.                
 All the marsh now belongs to the RSPB 
 and is a wintering ground for many    
 types of wader and duck. Shell-duck   
 and oyster catchers are common.
