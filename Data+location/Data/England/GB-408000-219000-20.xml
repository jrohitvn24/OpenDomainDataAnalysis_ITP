		<title>20Bus Service At Notgrove</title>
		<content>  Living in Notgrove is quiet, with    
 life                                  
 revolving mainly round the seasonal   
 work of the farm. It is a close knit  
 community with plenty of local        
 activities taking place in the village
 hall and the church. Shopping is done 
 mainly in Cheltenham or Cirencester.  
 Twice a week, on Thursday morning and 
 Saturday afternoon a Pulhams coach    
 takes people from the village into    
 Cheltenham. At other times people have
 to walk up to the main A436 road to   
 catch the bus.
