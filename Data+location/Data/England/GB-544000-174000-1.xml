		<content>   Most of the area is in Bexley London
 Borough,but the western edge is in    
 Greenwich.It is 10 miles to London,and
 is typical 1930's suburbia,with many  
 semi-detached houses.People travel    
 into London by car or train.          
 There are many facilities such as     
 supermarkets,restaurants,churches,    
 parks,sports centre,swimming          
 pool,Bingo club,social clubs,etc.     
 Danson Park is the biggest landscaped 
 park in Bexley.                       
 Many people know Shooters Hill-the    
 highest point in south-east           
 London.Over the top of the hill runs  
 Shooters Hill Road,an old Roman road  
 which went from London to North Kent. 
 It is very busy with cars commuting to
 London,and new roads are planned to   
 ease congestion.
