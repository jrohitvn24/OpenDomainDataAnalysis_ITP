		<title>05CHRISTLETON MONDAY PART 2</title>
		<content> Mum met me from school and we enjoyed 
 a walk along the canal to Christleton 
 Mill. I bought some crisps and        
 chocolate to munch on the way home. I 
 saw a young cygnet and a grey         
 squirrel. After completing homework I 
 watched "Blue Peter" my favourite     
 childrens programme together with a   
 news report of Prince Charles and Lady
 Diana in Italy.James came home on his 
 BMX Bike after playing Rugby at       
 school. Dad arrived home in our       
 Vauxhall car at 6.00pm and we had tea 
 of scrambled eggs, beans, toast,      
 yoghurt and cheese and biscuits. At   
 6.30pm I watched "Grange Hill" and    
 James played with his "Spectrum       
 Computer".At 7.50pm Mum went to sing  
 with the Village Singers.I was ready  
 for bed at 8.00pm and read one of my  
 favourite books. Later Dad  went for  
 his nightly run.                      </content>
