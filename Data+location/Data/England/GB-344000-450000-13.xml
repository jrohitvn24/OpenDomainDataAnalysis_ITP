		<title>13Footpaths around Cockerham</title>
		<content> The footpaths around Cockerham form a 
 network of communication across the   
 farmlands of the area. Many are short 
 connected by the local roads,others   
 bisect the countryside and are used by
 walkers, ramblers and local people.   
 Leading from farms and houses to the  
 salt marshes to the west, Church and  
 village in the centre and Lancaster   
 Canal to the east.Two head eastwards  
 behind the village, rising sharply,   
 giving a wonderful view over Cockerham
 Sands, falling quickly again through  
 grassland to the canal. Two lead north
 westerly coming out onto Hillam Lane. 
 The lower one running alongside two   
 small becks, branching westwards onto 
 saltmarshes at Patty's.Some of these  
 footpaths have been used very         
 profitably to raise hundreds of pounds
 for church &amp; school in the form of    
 sponsored walks giving delight to all.</content>
