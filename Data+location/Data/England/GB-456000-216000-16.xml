		<title>16RURAL TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content>The village of Merton is poorly served 
by public transport.There are adequate 
bus services to Oxford on the weekdays 
but these don't run in the evenings and
there are only limited services at the 
weekends.A courtesy service to the town
of Bicester runs twice a week.Most     
residents are reliant on cars to get   
them to work or when they want to go   
shopping.About 75% of the households in
the village use their own cars to get  
themselves to work.Children are taken  
to the local schools by coach or car.  
Traders using vans supply the village  
with milk,bread,groceries,fish and     
coal.Doctors' Surgeries are to be found
at Islip or at Bicester but getting to 
them can present problems to the       
elderly,especially, who haven't got    
their own transport.The proposed route 
of the M.40 Motorway will pass very    
close to the village if it's built.    </content>
