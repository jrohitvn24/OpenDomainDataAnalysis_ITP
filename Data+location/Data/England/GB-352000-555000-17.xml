		<title>17BUILDINGS IN CASTLE CARROCK</title>
		<content>     The first reference to CASTEL     
 CAIROC was in 1165.   The actual      
 castle site is unknown, but may have  
 been behind the present-day church.   
 The church lies on a medieval site,   
 with a gravestone beside the altar    
 raised in 1346.   Most of the present 
 day building dates from 1828.         
     Garth House, a large house        
 overlooking the village, was built in 
 1667, and the Rectory in 1727.   Many 
 local farms date from the 19th Century
 as do most buildings in the centre of 
 the village.                          
     By the late 19th century the      
 Watson family owned most of the       
 village.   They restored the Church in
 1888, funded the Village Hall (the    
 Watson Institute), three tithe        
 cottages, and their own Gelt Hall -   
 the largest building in the village.
