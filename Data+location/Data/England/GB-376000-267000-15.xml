		<content>   The 1951 planning permission cannot 
 be revoked and no Local Authority     
 would want to stop the quarrying      
 because of the cost of compensation to
 the quarrying company.                
                                       
   Several companies have quarried the 
 site and the present company is now   
 nearing the end of its permitted 1951 
 area. Consequently it has applied for 
{further planning permission}to the    
 South and the case is due to come     
 before the County Council in November 
 of this year. (1985)                  
                                       
   As the matter is {sub judice}there  
 can obviously be no discussion, but   
 members are hopeful that they can     
 reduce the requested quarrying area by
 two-thirds. You readers of the future 
 may judge whether they were successful
 or not.                               </content>
