		<title>03BISHOP AUCKLAND - Summary</title>
		<content> The town is{mainly residential,}with  
 very little industry. The market end  
 of the town is currently being        
 pedestrianised. The prevailing        
 economic climate is reflected by the  
 number of empty shops and the lack of 
 new businesses.                       
 Bishop Auckland is surrounded by a    
 number of{semi-derelict mining        
{villages}which are gradually being    
{demolished}or{redeveloped.}Even some  
 of the redeveloped sites on which     
 factories were built in recent years  
 are already being redeveloped         
 themselves as the{factories}have      
 closed and fallen into disuse.        
 Rapid new{housing development}is      
 taking place along the south-western  
 perimeter of the town, although       
 children from the{new estates}must    
 come to{schools}situated in the       
 southern quadrant of the town.        </content>
