		<content> A child's day at school.              
 On Wednesday, the first thing I do    
 when I get to school is English.  When
 everyone is sitting down , our teacher
 takes the register.  Then we go to the
 hall for assembly.  After assembly    
 some people do Maths and some do Art. 
 After play at 10.30, we carry on with 
 our Maths till dinner at 12.00.  I    
 have school dinners which are quite   
 nice.                                 
 After we have had dinner we go out to 
 play.  When the bell goes, we get     
 changed for rounders.  We play on the 
 field, while the third and fourth year
 boys play cricket.  When we get back  
 to school we change and then we have  
 playtime.  I usually play football.   
 After play we tidy the room and sit   
 down on the carpet for a story.  Then 
 we go home.
