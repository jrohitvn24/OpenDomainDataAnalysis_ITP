		<title>20BLEEDING WOLF SCHOLAR GREEN</title>
		<content>  Legend tells how a local forester by 
 the name of Lawton saved King John    
 from being killed by a wolf. As a     
 reward John gave the forester all the 
 land he could walk over in a week     
 starting at the wolf's body.          
  Lawton took the king at his word,    
 covered as much ground as he could,   
 took possession and founded his own   
 estate.                               
  On the spot where the wolf met its   
 fate an inn was built. So an incident 
 which may have altered the course of  
 history and ended an unpopular reign  
 was the means by which one of the most
 famous inns of this area was founded. 
  Nowadays the inn is famous for its   
 dining facilities and especially for  
 the cold table available at lunchtime 
 each weekday.
