		<title>19A COOKSMILL GREEN RESIDENT</title>
		<content> I have lived in Cooksmill Green nearly
 all my life and I've had enough of it.
 Things have changed so much and not   
 really for the better.We used to have 
 a{shop}but now it's a house.The pub is
 a house so is the old school at Radley
 Green.Anyone{without a car}has to rely
 on neighbours for shopping.The nearest
 shop is 3 miles away.The{bus service  
 is a joke.Once I could see my children
 to school,get the bus to Chelmsford,  
 and be back for tea.Now the 1st bus   
 passes the bottom of the lane too late
 to get anyone to work,too early for   
 mothers.The evening bus into town does
 not return.The Council used to{cut the
{verges}before the cow parsley seeded, 
 now that's up to the farmers.{Milk}is 
 only{delivered}every other day A{copse
{seems to disappear}overnight.{Fields  
 have become like{prairies.            
 The{real country people}have{gone.  } </content>
