		<content>    IN BREAN THERE ARE ABOUT 20 PILL   
BOXES SCATTERED ALONG THE COAST AND THE
SURROUNDING COUNTRY SIDE ALONG SOME OF 
THE ROADS AND RIVERS.THEY WERE MANNED  
AND LOOKED AFTER BY THE HOME GUARD AND 
THE REGULAR ARMY.THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN  
USED TO DETER AN INVASION BY THE GERMAN
ARMY COMING UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AND 
LANDING ON BERROW,BREAN AND BURNHAM    
BEACH.                                 
   ON THE SAND ON BREAN BEACH THEY PUT 
CONCRETE BLOCKS INTO THE SAND TO RIP   
THE BOTTOM OF THE BOATS THAT MAY TRY TO
LAND ON THE BEACH.                     
   THERE WAS A FORT AT BREAN WHICH WAS 
A VITAL ARTILLARY IMPLACEMENT TO STOP  
THE GERMAN NAVY FROM GOING UP THE      
CHANNEL.IT WAS LINKED WITH A SIMULAR   
GUN IMPLACEMENT ON AN ISLAND COULD     
STEEP-HOLME.TOGETHER THEY COULD SEAL   
OFF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL.
