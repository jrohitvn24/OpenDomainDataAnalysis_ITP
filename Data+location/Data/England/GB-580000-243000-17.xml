		<content> Mr Finch told us he went to Bristol on
 Saturday by{HS125}to celebrate one of 
 his heroes, engineer Isombard{Brunel} 
 who built fine bridges, stations and  
 ships for the{Great Western Railway,} 
 begun with broad guage in 1835. From  
 the 'railway cathedral'{(Paddington)  
 the line is very level, through Goring
 Gap in the Chilterns, across the Vale 
 of the White Horse to Box tunnel; they
 say this is designed so sunrise shines
 right through on Brunel's{birthday.   
 From Bristol, America was reached with
 ships like{SS Great Britain,}(world's 
 first, screw-driven with steel hull); 
 Mr Finch saw her in the '70s coming   
 under{Clifton suspension bridge}on a  
 pontoon after years languishing in the
 Falklands - now she has been restored.
{Temple Meads}station is like a castle;
 here they had a dinner, with 'strawbs'
 and cream, and 150th birthday cake.   </content>
