		<title>15E.Horsley S. Garden Centre</title>
		<content> This busy Garden Centre &amp; Nursery is  
 on the main East/West road.  It covers
 21 acres and employs an average of 14 
 people.  During the Easter &amp; Summer   
 vacations university students are     
 employed as additional help.  Before  
 World War II it was an orchard, now it
 comprises an office for tree surgeons,
 several large glasshouses for raising 
 indoor plants and annual seedlings for
 sale to enthusiastic amateur garden-  
 ers, together with shrubs and trees.  
 A mobile van sells fresh fish on      
 Fridays, &amp; fruit &amp; vegetables, includ-
 ing overseas fruit bought in, are on  
 sale, potential customers being attra-
 cted by the display at the gate.      
 Whilst this is mostly used by local   
 people, it is in a good position to   
 attract passing traffic. Gardening im-
 plements and seeds, and seasonal items
 such as Christmas trees are also sold.</content>
