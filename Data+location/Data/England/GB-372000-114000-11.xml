		<title>11BLACKMORE VALE  LOCAL SPORTS</title>
		<content> Here are no local amenities for indoor
 sports nor football pitches but the   
 local people have their own forms of  
 recreation.In the winter,foxhunting,  
 when the local hunt,The Blackmore Vale
 and Sparkford hounds chase the fox    
 across the open fields,followed by    
 huntsmen.As few poultry are kept the  
 numerous foxes do little harm but old 
 traditions must be kept alive.It is   
 quite a spectacle to see the men in   
 hunting pink following the hounds in  
 full cry.    In the autumn pheasant   
 and rabbit Shoots are organised. Young
 birds are seen and rabbits abound.    
 The parts of the waterways rented by  
 the local angling society provide very
 quiet fishing for chub and perch.The  
 nearby bigger River Stour would be    
 usually more popular.                 
 Winter evening entertainment involves 
 lengthy journeys or home activities.  </content>
