		<title>16   GHOSTS IN MY GARDEN</title>
		<content> I live in a house on a hillside       
 overlooking the sea.During the        
 Occupation the property was used by   
 the Germans.There are three gun       
 emplacements in the grounds and the   
 flat terrace which runs all the way   
 across the gardens below the house,   
 used to have a railway line on it     
 which was used to ferry the ammunition
 to the bunkers.It is said that the    
 dead and dying slave workers who built
 the bunkers were thrown into a dry    
 well in the garden and it was then    
 covered over with a very large granite
 stone.It was also said that the lonely
 spirits of these poor slaves were seen
 in the garden by a previous owner of  
 the property. He told them that if    
 they found comfort and rest there     
 they were welcome to stay.
