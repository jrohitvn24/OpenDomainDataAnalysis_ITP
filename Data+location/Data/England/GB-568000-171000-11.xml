		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF PHILIP</title>
		<content> Philip wakes up at 7.15 on a school   
 day. He goes downstairs and watches   
 Popeye on breakfast television. He    
 gets the newspaper and reads the T.V  
 and sports pages and also does the    
 quiz. He then goes into the kitchen to
 have his breakfast and listen to the  
 radio. Philip then gets washed,       
 dressed and cleans his teeth. He then 
 waits for Mrs Makriel to take him to  
 school. He arrives at school at 8.50  
 and goes inside to read his book. At  
 playtime Philip plays tag with a      
 friend. For dinner he brings a packed 
 lunch of sandwiches and a drink.      
 After school Philip plays cricket with
 his father and after watering his     
 sunflowers he watches television and  
 has his tea. He watches more T.V until
 he goes to bed at about 9.30 pm.
