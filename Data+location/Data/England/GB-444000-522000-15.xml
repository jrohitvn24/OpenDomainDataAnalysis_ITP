		<title>15Billingham Forum</title>
		<content> The forum is a meeting place for      
 people in the area. The Forum Theatre 
 with 637 seats is used for musicals,  
 plays, ballets and films. The theatre 
 walls and boxes are panelled with     
 brown wood. The seats are red velvet. 
 The seats on the two upper levels are 
 in boxes. Shows often come to         
 Billingham before they go to London   
 theatres. The sport area caters for   
 all major sports, including football, 
 netball, badminton, gymnastics, tennis
 and squash. There is a multi-gym and  
 karate club. There are two swimming   
 pools, one is deep the other for      
 learners. There is an ice rink, a soft
 play area and a sauna. Every month a  
 free exhibition is held at the Forum.
