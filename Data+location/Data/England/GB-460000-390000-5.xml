		<title>05BIRCOTES SPORTS CENTRE (1)</title>
		<content> I like the{Sports Centre }because it  
 is near,neat and tidy.I also like it  
 because it has got a lot of good games
 and activities.I also like the{Sports 
{Centre }because when something goes   
 wrong one of the assistants comes to  
 help you straight away and  they are  
 very polite.My favourite activities   
 are{Swimming }and watching {Squash.}I 
 also like the{Sports centre}because   
 it is very cheap.But I think that     
 there is too much chlorine in the{    
{Swimming}pool.We did a survey of      
 people who use the {Sports Centre} and
 asked about the things they liked     
 about the {Sports Centre}.Some of the 
 things we found out are on the next   
 page.
