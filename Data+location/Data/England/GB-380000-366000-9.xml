 On completing the section we found    
 many different and interesting        
 results.In answer to question one it  
 was found that most people watch      
 television especially during the

 is quite remote, the nearest town     
 being a few miles away.The most       
 popular channel was either BBC1 or    
 BBC2.                                 </content>
