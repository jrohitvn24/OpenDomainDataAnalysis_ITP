  At Bradwell school we have several   
 modern electrical machines; a         
 computer, video recorder, television  
 and radio. They all help to make our  
 work interesting and vivid.           
   We had a concert at Easter in which 
 we sang songs, played musical         
 instruments and performed a play about
 Robin Hood.                           
  This year our outside charity was the
 N.S.P.C.C..  We raised Â£160 which was 
 presented to Princess Margaret at     
 Derby Cathedral by two children from  
 this school.                          
  We have competitions against other   
 primary schools in soccer, netball,   
 swimming and athletics.               
   We have been busy forming a library 
 in school in which we have numbered   
 and colour coded the topic books so we
 can find them easily.                 </content>
