		<title>19Development Of Moulton</title>
		<content> Salt mining increased around Moulton  
 in the mid 19th Century. Many people  
 who worked in the salt industry moved 
 to Moulton from surrounding areas.    
 Between 1801 and 1891AD the population
 has increased by 1006. Because their  
 workers had no where to live the salt 
 union built 2 rows of terraced housing
 and called them Church and Regent     
 Street. Since 1960AD many new houses  
 have been built and 3 new housing     
 estates.                              
 They were named Beechfield, Weaver    
 Grange and Lodge Drive. This led to an
 increase in population of over 2000.  
 The increases in population created   
 more custom for the village shop and  
 services. There are 10 shops and over 
 900 houses in Moulton.
