		<title>16CHANGING FACE OF FARMING 3</title>
		<content> THATCHING THE STRAW BALES IS NO LONGER
 NECESSARY.FARMERS USED TO KEEP FEW    
 ACCOUNTS LIVING FROM HAND TO MOUTH.   
 NOW BECAUSE OF VAT FULL ACCOUNTS HAVE 
 TO BE KEPT AND MOST LANG FARMS EMPLOY 
 A SECRETARY TO LOOK AFTER THIS SIDE OF
 THE BUSINESS.                         
 IN CONCLUSION THE MODERN FARM WORKER  
 NEEDS TO BE A HIGHLY SKILLED          
 TECHNICIAN ABLE TO COPE WITH THE      
 DEMANDS THAT NEW FARM MACHINERY       
 BRINGS.                               
 IT IS SAD TO SAY THAT NEW METHODS HAVE
 SEEN A DECLINE IN THE FARMING         
 COMMUNITY,LOW WAGES HAVE NOT HELPED   
 EITHER IN AN DECLINING NEED OF MAN    
 POWER. WHOLE FAMILIES HAVE MOVED OUT  
 OF THE HAMLETS TO THE TOWN
