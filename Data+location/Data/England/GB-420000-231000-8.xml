		<title>08MARKET DAY AT MORETON</title>
		<content> Moreton with its wide streets has been
 a{market}town since the Middle Ages.  
 Since the time of Charles I Moreton   
 has had a{charter}to hold a market in 
 the streets. This was a cattle market.
 Since 1976, when the market rights    
 were bought by the present owners, a  
 market has been held every{Tuesday.}  
{Trips}to the market are arranged from 
 all over England e.g. Manchester and  
 London. We met visitors from Canada   
 and Australia and also heard that a   
 Australian television crew had been   
 filming the market. The market, one of
 the{largest one day markets}in the    
 country, has 164 stalls and 111       
 pitches. About 5000 people attend each
 week. In our survey we found that     
 there were 46 clothes stalls, 26      
 household goods stalls and 16 that    
 sell food. Customers, stallholders and
 shopkeepers think the market is good. </content>
