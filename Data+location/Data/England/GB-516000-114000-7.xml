		<content> The Church of St. James, Ashurst.     
 Diocese of Chichester.                
 The earliest part of the building     
 dates from the late 12 century.  An   
 aisle, south chapel and south west    
 tower were added about 1200.  The     
 chancel was rebuilt in 1720 as part of
 an extensive restoration programme.   
 The south porch was rebuilt during a  
 second restoration 1877.  This        
 programme also rebuilt the tower.     
                                       
      'The font, vamping horn          
       and memorial by John Flaxman    
       are the only important          
       fittings.  Michael Fairless,    
       author of 'The Roadmender',     
       is buried in the churchyard.'
