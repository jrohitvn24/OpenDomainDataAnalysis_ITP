		<title>08TRANSPORT IN COUNTESTHORPE</title>
		<content> The most popular form of transport    
 is cars because of their speed and    
 efficiency.Although they are one of   
 the most expensive forms of transport 
 with petrol at nearly Â£1.90 a gallon. 
 Most families own a car.              
     Bikes are probably the cheapest   
 form of transport used but they are   
 not the most popular because they     
 don't go very fast although they reach
 speeds of 30-40mph in races.Nearly all
 children own a bike.And many people   
 use a bike to cycle to work.          
     Buses come through our village    
 every half an hour and cost 75p for a 
 child and for an adult Â£1.40 for a    
 return to Leicester.They are very much
 slower than a car though a lot of     
 people use the bus service.The name of
 the bus service is Midland Fox.It is  
 quite an old service,the colours of   
 the buses are red and yellow.         </content>
