		<title>15LIPWOOD HALL, HAYDON BRIDGE.</title>
		<content> This is the only{stately home}in this 
 block. It was built in the            
 19th.century. It is owned by{Lord &amp;   
{Lady Elliott.}It is built of sandstone
 from a nearby quarry but like many    
 houses in the area has hard           
 (limestone?)corner blocks. It is slate
 roofed but stone flags remain on part 
 of it. Special features include a     
 curved section of exterior wall, an   
 imposing entrance hall,wood-lined,    
 like the dining-room. Even the stables
 are wood-lined. A Victorian bath-room 
 survives as does a kitchen garden, now
 laid-out with flowers &amp; shrubs. The   
 house retains fine beech trees in a   
 small park, a stable cottage &amp; a coach
 house.{Whinnetley Farm}was once its   
 Home Farm. At both  Whinnetley &amp;      
 Lipwood Hall are the remains of older 
 houses.
