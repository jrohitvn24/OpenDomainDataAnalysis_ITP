    In Guilthwaite a mineral water spa 
 has been found.                       
 It was discovered in 1664 by George   
 Westby of Guilthwaite who had studied 
 Physics.He built a small house over   
 the well and made a large bath for    
 several people to go in at once.      
    He was supported by Dr.Yarburgh of 
 Newark who sent many of his patients  
 to take the cure.Gradually the house  
 was allowed to decay after the death  
 of Westby.The spa can still be found  
 and is marked on the map at Spa House 
 farm.The water is said to be a cure   
 for Vomitings,Belchings,Cholera,      
 Flatulences,Hypo-Indegestion, Stone   
 obstructed catamenia,Green Sickness,  
 Heat and stoppage of water,habitual   
 Cholicks, Obesity,heart burn and
