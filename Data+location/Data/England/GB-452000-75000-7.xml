		<content> This part of the Island is blessed to 
 have one of the mildest climates,     
 facing south east with the coastline  
 on its southern boundary and having   
 rising downland at its back.          
 The whole area is criss crossed with  
 public footpaths, especially along the
 'Undercliff'.It is a haven for many   
 forms of wildlife and numbers; red    
 squirrels,foxes,badgers lizards and   
 snakes among them.It also provides a  
 wonderful habitat for the growth of   
 wild flowers.See Appendix 1 for a     
 list of those identified during a     
 short walk along 'Paradise Walk' on   
 Monday the 8th July 1985.             
 The{rare cuckoo-pint (arum neglectum)}
 has also been found along the         
 undercliff, and the{Glanville         
{Fritillary}known as the I.O.W.        
 butterfly, a rare species has been    
 spotted in this area.                 </content>
