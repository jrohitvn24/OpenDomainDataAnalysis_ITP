		<title>14The R.N.A.S. Swimming Pool</title>
		<content>   On a Saturday I go to the swimming  
 baths at the{R.N.A.S.}It is a{heated  
{open-air pool}which is open from      
 10a.m-5p.m. It hasn't got a           
 diving board but we play polo a lot.  
 You can also join{coaching classes}to 
 improve your swimming.                
   To get there from Ilchester you have
 to walk or cycle as it is one and a   
 half miles away. You also need a pass 
 to get in.People who work on the Base 
 can get in free because it was        
 originally built for them but other   
 people have to pay to go in.          
   At the side of the pool there is an 
 ice-cream shop and a second shop      
 called the{Heron Club}which sells     
 crisps,sweets,chocolate and canned    
 drinks. My swimming session usually   
 ends with a visit to one of these two 
 shops!                                
                                       </content>
