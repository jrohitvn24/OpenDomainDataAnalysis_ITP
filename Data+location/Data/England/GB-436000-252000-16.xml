		<content> Mr.and Mrs.Gibbins are the oldest     
 people in Northend.Mr.Gibbins is 89   
 years old and Mrs.Gibbins is 87 years 
 old.They left school when aged 13.    
   The village has changed a lot during
 their lives.There are three times as  
 many houses as there were when        
 Mr.Gibbins was a boy.There used to be 
 three cottages in what is now the "Red
 Lion" car-park.Once the{Prebend}was an
 allotment but a small housing estate  
 was built there in the 1950s.{Nortons 
{Close}was a field called 'Nortons     
 Close'. Twelve houses were built there
 in the 1950s and a few years later    
 they built six more.In the 1960s an   
 orchard,which grew in{Top Street,}was 
 removed and a number of modern houses 
 built.
