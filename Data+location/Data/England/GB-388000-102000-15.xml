		<content>  I like to play many games.These are  
 two of my favourites.This is how you  
 play"it".You get some of your friends 
 together and you choose someone to be 
 "it".Now to be "it" means you are the 
 goodie and you are trying to touch    
 your friends who are the baddies.When 
 you touch them they become the goodie 
 and whoever was "it" becomes a baddy. 
 Another one of my favourite games is  
 Pacman.You have to have about 2O      
 people one of them has to be Pacman.  
 When you are Pacman you move your arms
 up and down and try to catch one of   
 the other people who are trying to    
 escape from Pacman.If Pacman gets a   
 person they become a Pacman too. .
