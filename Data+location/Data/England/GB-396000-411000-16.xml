		<title>16BIRDWATCHING ON THE MOORLAND</title>
		<content> The Rochdale Field Natualist Society, 
 who have records of all bird sightings
 in the area, have been very excited   
 this year for two reasons. Firstly, at
 the northern end of Piethorne         
 reservoir Canada Geese have produced  
 offspring for the first time.With the 
 draining of nearby Hollingworth Lake a
 pair arrived at Piethorne and have    
 produced five goslings this year.     
        In the coniferous woodland on  
 the north-western side of Piethorne   
 there are a pair of long eared owls   
 nesting.This is the first time ever in
 the area that this has happened.      
 Needless to say a watch was kept on   
 the site to ensure that the eggs were 
 safe from theft.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
