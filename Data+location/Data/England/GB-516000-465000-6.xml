		<content> In and around the centre there is a   
 lot of Victorian and Edwardian        
 property. many of these are used for  
 holiday accomodation of one kind or   
 another. There are a number of        
 imposing terraces.                    
    More expensive, larger, private    
 housing is to be found to the south of
 the town along Kingsgate. As one goes 
 from here towards the A166 along      
 Bessingby road West Hill council      
 estate can be seen to the left. This  
 is a fairly modern, but not expanding 
 estate of mixed housing; low flats    
 and two storey semi-detached houses.  
 There is a small row of shops together
 with an open space community centre.  
    New Pasture Lane is a more recent  
 estate to the north west of the town  
 and is a mixture of private and       
 council houses and a small number of  
 bungalows.                            </content>
