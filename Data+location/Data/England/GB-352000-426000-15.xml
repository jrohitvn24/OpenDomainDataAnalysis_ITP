		<content>{TIN CAN CALINKI}is a bit like hide and
 and seek. Somebody is'on',and we say  
 "go"and kick the can.The person who is
 counting, counts to one hundred and   
 then finds the can.If the person who  
 is on sees someone he shouts"Tin Can  
 Calinki", and if you get your 'whip'  
 (back to the base, freely) you shout  
 your name and "Tin Can Calinki".      
{SKIPPING.}I brought ropes to school   
 and played the skipping game,where two
 people turned the rope and sang this  
 song. "When its your birthday please  
 jump in,January,February,March,April, 
 May,June,July,August,September, Octo_ 
 ber,November,December. When it's your 
 birthday please jump out.January,Febr_
 uary,March,April,May,June,July,August,
 September,October,November, December. 
{ROLLERBOOTS}are like trainers, but are
 boots,with wheels on. I like playing  
 on mine because it is exciting.       </content>
