		<title>05A Killamarsh Shopper</title>
		<content> We walked down to Bridge Street in    
 Killamarsh where most of our shops are
 and asked a middle-aged lady shopper  
 if she would talk to us about shopping
 in Killamarsh. She told us that       
 shopping in Killamarsh was very good  
 because ther was plenty of choice,    
 because the prices were quite         
 reasonable and because she didn't have
 far to walk home with the heavy       
 shopping. She thought that the bus    
 services in Killamarsh weren't very   
 good for shoppers who had to come a   
 long way because they didn't run often
 enough. She shops about once every day
 for the odd thing but has a 'big shop'
 every Saturday. She doesn't buy       
 expensive things in Killamarsh such as
 a new television or a new suite       
 because there isn't enough choice and 
 the prices are too high. She goes to  
 Sheffield fot things like that.       </content>
