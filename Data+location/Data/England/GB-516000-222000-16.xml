		<title>16STRAWPLAITING IN PRESTON</title>
		<content> Strawplaiting was an important feature
 of village life in rural Preston until
 the latter part of the 19th century.  
 The extra money earned by the farm_   
 worker's wife and children raised the 
 standard of living above the average. 
 There were 2 strawplait schools in the
 village and children of 7 or younger  
 were taught to plait the wheatstraw.  
 Some of the plait was worked with     
 split straw and some with whole.There 
 were many patterns.The completed      
 plaits, in 20 yd lengths, were taken  
 to  Hitchin market and the plait      
 buyer would give about 2d for good    
 work.From there the lengths of plait  
 would go to factories in Luton to be  
 made into hats.The art of strawplait  
 has died but the tools_straw splitters
 and straw mills are to be found in    
 Hitchin Museum.
