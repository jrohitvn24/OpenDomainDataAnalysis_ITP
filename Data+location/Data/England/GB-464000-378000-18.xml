		<content> THE AREA WHICH HAS BEEN UNDER OUR     
 ATTENSION IS ONE WHICH HAS FEW        
 INHABITANTS BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE    
 FARMING METHODS. THERE HAS BEEN A     
 STEADY DECLINE IN THE POPULATION DUE  
 TO MECHANISATION OF THESE FARMS AND   
 THE FACT THAT MACHINES CAN NOW DO THE 
 JOB BETTER. SPRAYING OF CROPS GOES OUT
 TO TENDER AND LARGE PURPOSE BUILT     
 TRUCKS OR HELICOPTERS CAN DO THE JOB  
 IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME A TRACTOR   
 AND CMBINATION COULD IN THE PAST.THE  
 LOCAL SCHOOL HAS SEEN ITS NUMBERS  CUT
 DRASTICALLY FROM A HIGH OF 105 DOWN TO
 30 DUE ALSO TO A FALL IN THE BIRTHRATE
 AND THE ESPENSIVE LOCAL HOUSING.THE   
 AMENITIES AVAILABLE TO THE LOCALS     
 APART FROM THE PUB IS NOTHING. WITHOUT
 A GOOD BUS SERVICE (HALF HOURLY) OR   
 PRIVATE TRANSPORT THE LOCAL TOWNS OF  
 RETFORD AND WORKSOP WOULD BE TOO FAR  
 AWAY>                                 </content>
