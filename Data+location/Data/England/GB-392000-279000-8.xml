		<title>08CLENT LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> Clent is very interesting to visit    
 with friends. If you keep your eyes   
 peeled you can see the wildlife and   
 sheep and horse riding. There are map 
 boards to help you around. You can    
 then follow the yellow arrows around  
 the hills. A lot of the land is owned 
 by the National Trust who preserve    
 the land for the country. At the top  
 of the hill are the{Four Stones,}these
 look like ancient remains but in fact 
 were put up by the Victorians about   
 100 years ago. Also on the side of the
 hill is an easier footpath called a { 
{Disabled Trail,}this is so that people
 in wheelchairs can get to the top as  
 well.
