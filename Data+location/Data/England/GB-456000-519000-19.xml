		<content>{CLIMATE:}The climate is  variable and 
 is affected by the sea(Maritime       
 conditions)so we don't get any        
 extremes in temperature.The average   
 over the last 30 years for January    
 are 2/3c,July is 14/15c.Compared with 
 the rest of the country,there is a    
 very low precipitation count of 750mm 
 per annum.{POLLUTION:}Pollution is    
 high because of the chemical works.   
 Successful attempts have been made    
 to lower the pollution in recent years
 Other pollution consists of carfumes, 
 general litter and a small amount of  
 graffiti,there has also been some     
 unauthorised dumping of rubbish.      
{WILDLIFE:}The area we covered had a   
 variety of plant and insect life.We   
 found leaf eaters E.g.the Burnett moth
 seen more as a caterpillar,and we     
 collected a sap-sucking Greenfly.We   
 also found a Cantharus Rustica.       </content>
