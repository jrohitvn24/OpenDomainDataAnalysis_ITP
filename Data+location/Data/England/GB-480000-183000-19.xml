		<title>19MY FATHER'S DAY</title>
		<content> My father often wakes up at 6 o'clock 
 in the morning.For breakfast he       
 usually has All Bran,which is little  
 brown sticks of bran.After breakfast  
 he goes off to London to work.London  
 is a famous city in England.He works  
 in an office.He arrives at 7.15a.m.My 
 father is the boss of an engineering  
 company.He does not come home for     
 lunch.He goes to a cafe with his      
 workmates.My father eats chicken salad
 when he is at the cafe but when he's  
 at home he eats anything that's going.
   When he goes back to work he starts 
 phoning people up &amp; talking to        
 them.He also writes letters to people 
 &amp; chats over company business.He      
 usually sets off for home at about    
 8.45p.m. so he does not usually see me
 in the evening.
