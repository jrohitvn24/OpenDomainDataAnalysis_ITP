		<title>14CHURCHES IN ELLAND</title>
		<content> For hundreds of years the established 
 church had little competition, the    
 Parish Church of St.Mary the Virgin   
 being the only church in Elland.      
 However, there are many church        
 buildings in Ejlland reflecting the   
 Protestant movement and the           
 dissatisfaction felt with the Church  
 of England in the 18th and 19th       
 centuries.   A Baptist Church was     
 taken over by the Ranters, Thumpers   
 and Secularists in 1791.  It was dem- 
 olished in 1925 for road widening and 
 the stone was used to build the Rising
 Sun Inn. The Providence Congregational
 Church opened in 1823, was extended in
 1856 and a new church built in 1883.  
 Now called the United Reform Church it
 is still in use today. Bethesda Church
 built 1824,gave way to the present    
 buildings of 1880 and continues with  
 regular worship.                      </content>
