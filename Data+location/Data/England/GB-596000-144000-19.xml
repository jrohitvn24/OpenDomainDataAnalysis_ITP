		<title>19POTTERS CORNER (1)</title>
		<content>{Potters Corner}is a sprawling village 
 extending along two minor roads joined
 to the{A20 Trunk road.                
                                       
 The main{Ashford/London}railway cuts  
 right through the village though under
 bridges.                              
                                       
 The village has a{public house}and is 
 adjacent to a{golf course}and is close
 to{The Warren}recreation area.        
                                       
 However the village is likely to      
 suffer a great deal from noise lying  
 as it does on the main line railway   
 and between, on the one side, the{A20 
{Trunk road}and on the other side, the 
 extention of the{M20 Motor-way.}All   
 within half a mile distance.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
