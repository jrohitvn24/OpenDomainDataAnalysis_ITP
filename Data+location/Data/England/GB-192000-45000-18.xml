		<content>   The average age of congregation is  
 over forty years.This includes younger
 age groups which accasionally attend  
 the services.                         
   Many people just use the church for 
 getting babtised,married and          
 buried.The number of children the     
 church baptises varies from four to   
 twelve.Also there are about three or  
 four weddings a year.The congregation 
 ranges from four  people to           
 eighteen.The church is very important 
 to the village,every five years the   
 church is checked but at the moment   
 the building is very sound.In an      
 average day the church would either be
 holding a service or doing nothing but
 for ten days in every month it would  
 be compiling the village magazine{    
 'Roseland'.When the church is not     
 doing anything it is left open for    
 visitors.                             </content>
