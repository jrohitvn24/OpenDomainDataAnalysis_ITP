		<title>02 Mr. Brown's Shop</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 Mr. Brown said that he bought the     
village shop in October 1975, nine     
years ago. He lives next to the shop   
with his wife and two daughters Emma   
and Rachel. Part of the shop used to be
where the kitchen is now and the house 
was much smaller. Mr. Brown goes to    
the Cash &amp; Carry in Peterborough on    
Mondays to buy his stock and then puts 
it in the stock room ready for pricing 
it later. Mrs. Pat Shacklock helps Mr. 
Brown in the shop together with Mrs.   
Judith Brown. In the shop you can buy  
ham, bread, biscuits, sweets, toys and 
even horse stables.
