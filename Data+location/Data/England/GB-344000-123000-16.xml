		<content> The Devonshire Arms Hotel: Built in   
 l82O as a shooting lodge, it has      
 served as an auction room as well as  
 public house and coaching station.    
 Death duties in l9l8 caused the sale  
 of this and many other properties of  
 the Devonshire family.                
 The Village Shop: Originally a C.W.S. 
 property, it is now in private hands. 
 It serves both parishes in the area,  
 and offers P.O. facilities.           
 The Crown Inn, Long Load: Originally  
 the Wheelwrights Arms, it served the  
 river workers, both on and off the    
 water. It was situated next to the    
 stabling and landing stages, on the   
 Load side of the River Yeo.
