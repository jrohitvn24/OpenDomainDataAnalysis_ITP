   I got up at 9.30a.m. I had break-   
 fast and washed the dishes.  I  had   
 a wash and cleaned my teeth and got   
 dressed into my jodhpurs and boots,   
 hat, shirt and jacket. (I was going   
 horse riding.) I was going to Hemerdon
 and I was going to ride Flicker (the  
 horse).                               
   I left home at 10.30 and went to    
 meet my best friend Justyna. We set   
 off for Hemerdon Riding Stables. We   
 got there at 10.55 and paid for the   
 ride.                                 
   I got on Flicker and Justyna got on 
 Tammy.  We went up on the moors and   
 went over some small jumps. We had a  
 good canter and gallop. We came off   
 the moors and down the road and went  
 back. I enjoyed myself very much.
