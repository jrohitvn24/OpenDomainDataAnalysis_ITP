		<title>10OUR SCHOOL CARETAKER.</title>
		<content>    Our school caretaker is called Mr. 
 Butters. He has been working in St    
 Joseph's School for three years and   
 four months. He started on March 4th, 
 1982 on a Thursday. When I went to    
 question Mr. Butters, he said that he 
 really likes his job. He starts at    
 eight o'clock and finishes at six     
 o'clock. His dinner break is from 12  
 o'clock to 2 o'clock. Sometimes when I
 go home for dinner he takes me in his 
 car.                                  
    His wife is the school secretary.  
 He has a son and a daughter. He works 
 from Monday to Friday and rests at the
 weekend. Mr. Butters has a timetable  
 of what he has to do.                 
    Mr. Butters' hobbies are golf and  
 mending motor cars. Our last caretaker
 was called Mr. Hopper but he died.    
    I like Mr. Butters. He makes sure  
 the school is always nice and tidy.   </content>
