		<title>15All Saints Church,Oval,Stev.</title>
		<content>   This excites people because it is   
 shared by{Catholics,Anglicans}and     
{Methodist};it is only 10 years old.The
{Reverend Purvis}told us it is shaped  
 like an arrow,pointing to{God}however 
 you worship.The special cross is in   
 four pieces with little gaps between  
 them to show that although the church 
 is shared,each group worships         
 differently.It is very modern with a  
 nice browny carpet,not like{St.       
{Nicholas Church}which is tiled.There  
 are lots of fresh flowers and some    
 candles to remind us of{God's gifts.  
   There is a{font}like all churches   
 for christening people but this one is
 in front by the{altar}where everyone  
 can watch the service.It is metal and 
 can be moved about.There is a special 
{entrance for brides and coffins.}A    
{special organ}or an old piano can     
 provide music.                        </content>
