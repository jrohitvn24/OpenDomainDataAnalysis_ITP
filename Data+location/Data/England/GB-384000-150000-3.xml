		<title>03LOCATION OF WESTBURY</title>
		<content> Overlooking the Somerset border,just  
 three miles away,Westbury stands on   
 the slopes of one of the most westerly
 promontories of the chalk downs of    
 Salisbury Plain.                      
 The name Westbury was given by the    
 early Saxons in the Dark Ages and it  
 means"the fortified place in the      
 West".In 1576 it appears              
 as"Westburye-under-ye-Plane",to       
 distinguish it from half-a-dozen other
 towns and villages of the same name.  
 Today Westbury is a growing town of   
 more than 7,000 people, proud of its  
 ancient history as a market town, a   
 gloving town, a woollen town and a    
 railway town.  The station today still
 provides a good, fast service to      
 London, Bath, Bristol, Salisbury,     
 Weymouth, Southampton and Portsmouth.
