		<content> This square contains the older houses 
 in Woolston and part of the Council   
 Estate of Weston,separated by a valley
 left as a park called Mayfield Park.  
 The Mayfield Estate used to belong to 
 the Radstock Family.                  
    In the Woolston part there is a    
 mixture of detatched and semis built  
 at different times from about 1920.It 
 is noticable,though,that scattered    
 among these houses are newer houses   
 built in the last 40 years the gaps   
 caused by bombing during the war.     
 Woolston Secondary Mixed school is    
 also just in this area.               
    The council estate has been built  
 in the last 20 years around the parish
 Church of The Holy Trinity.Here there 
 is a small shopping centre,a library,a
 doctors,a dentist and of course a     
 couple of pubs and a chip shop.
