		<title>17SCHOOL IN SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content> Our school,{Firshill Middle School,}is
 in an area of Sheffield called        
{Pitsmoor.}It was opened in 1893 and is
 an old board school. There is also a  
 first school which opened in 1906. It 
 has a nursery unit.                   
   During 1984/5 there were 12 teachers
 and about 200 children but in 1986    
 there will only be 10 teachers. There 
 is also a head teacher, a school      
 clerk, general assistant and a school 
 caretaker.                            
   In Firshill Middle School the       
 children are aged 8-12. There are 9   
 classes, two for each year except M3's
 who are in 3 classes. 8 classes are in
 the main building. Our class is in a  
 terrapin (mobile classroom) in the    
 middle of the yard. Boys and girls now
 share playgrounds which used to be    
 used separately.
