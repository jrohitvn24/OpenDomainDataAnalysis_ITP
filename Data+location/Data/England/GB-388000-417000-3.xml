		<title>03WHITWORTH DOCTORS</title>
		<content> The town of Whitworth built up around 
 the stone quarries and later the wool 
 and cotton mills. Of its population   
{probably its most famous citizens}were
 the "{DOCTORS OF WHITWORTH}". These   
 were a family called{TAYLOR}who       
 settled in Whitworth in the{18th.     
{century.}It all started with JOHN     
 TAYLOR who was an itinerant Blacksmith
 who practised his trade on either side
 of the Pennines.                      
  In a time of ill health he settled   
 in Whitworth and  he became known     
 locally as a skilled man and one with 
 a very considerable sympathy for      
 animals. His "{doctoring}" began when 
 he built a tin case to heal the broken
 leg of a cat. The leg healed well and 
 his reputation quickly spread. Very   
 soon he was dealing with humans. He   
 was joined by his brothers and they   
{treated patients from}all{over England</content>
