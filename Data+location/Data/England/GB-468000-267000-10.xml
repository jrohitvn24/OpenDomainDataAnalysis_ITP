		<content> THE MILD CLIMATE IN THIS AREA MAKES IT
 IDEAL FOR MANY WILD FLOWER SPECIES TO 
 SURVIVE. THE PRESENTLY ENDANGERED     
 CORNFLOWER MAY STILL BE FOUND ON SOME 
 LOCAL SITES AS ITS RURAL LOCATION     
 LEAVES IT RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED.     
 CIRCULAR SPINNEYS - CULTIVATED BY EARL
 SPENCER, A LOCAL LANDOWNER, EXIST ON  
 MOST HILLTOPS IN THE VICINITY. THESE  
 ARE INHABITED BY A COLLECTION OF      
 PIGEONS, GREY SQUIRRELS, MICE, RATS   
 AND THE INEVITABLE PHEASANT FAMILIES. 
 THE RABBIT POPULATION ALSO SEEMS TO BE
 INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS AND MAY    
 POSSIBLY PROVIDE A THREAT TO FARMERS  
 IN THE FUTURE, AS IN THE YEARS BEFORE 
 MIXIMATOSIS WAS INTRODUCED AS A MEANS 
 OF CONTROL.                           
 THERE IS LITTLE OR NO POLLUTION       
 LOCALLY AND THE NUMEROUS FOOTPATHS    
 PROVIDE MANY PLEASURABLE SIGHTS FOR   
 THE WALKER AND PONY RIDER ALIKE.      </content>
