		<title>01ROUND AND ABOUT GRANTHAM</title>
		<content> I caught the bus to Grantham bus      
 station.  My brother then went to the 
 football ground.  I walked to the     
 Isaac Newton Shopping Centre and into 
 Morrisons. I bought a few things. On  
 my way to the opticians I passed the  
 Guild Hall. The opticians was shut so 
 I decided to go to A&amp;A glazing.  I    
 ordered a sheet of glass for our front
 window. I went past the King school.  
 It was empty because it was half term.
 I had to go and get a book from the   
 Central school. Luckily there was a   
 caretaker there who let me in. From   
 there I took a footpath past Harrowby 
 Mill along the river Witham to Union  
 Street. I walked on to the Paragon and
 saw a film. After it finished I phoned
 a taxi to take me home. We went past  
 the leisure centre and I wished that I
 could go in the swimming pool. I was  
 soon back home.                       </content>
