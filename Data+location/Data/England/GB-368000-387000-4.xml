		<content> The original toll bridge was built    
 over the{River Mersey}in 1866 to      
 replace the{Warburton}to Hollins Green
 ferry. The old river bed is now used  
 for farming, and all that remains of  
 the river is a pond. You can still see
 the old toll house, which has been    
 used as an antique shop, but is now   
 deserted. The original bridge has been
 buried, and the new toll booth is for 
 the cantilever bridge built over the  
{Manchester Ship Canal.}There is an old
 church in{Warburton}which is no longer
 used regularly for services. It can be
 dated back to 1200. Nearby can be seen
 the remains of a cross, and the walls 
 leading down to the church are made   
 from slabs of slate which look like   
 gravestones.There are traces of Pre_  
 historic animals near to the old      
 church.
