		<content> The General Baptists meet in the Zion 
 Chapel, a building in the classical   
 style, dating from 1841. At present   
 regular worshippers number about 12.  
 Attached to the chapel is a schoolroom
 for meetings of groups such as the    
 Women's Fellowship. A commune was     
 founded on Buddhist principles in 1977
 at Gilletts and has 12 adults &amp; some  
 child members at present.             
 2 charities founded centuries ago     
 still benefit local people. Jacob     
 Turner left property to clothe poor   
 children; interest on the investment  
 is now given to the poor at Christmas.
 The Dadson Trust is an educational    
 charity providing grants for          
 apprentices &amp; students in further     
 education. 2 groups also raise money  
 in memory of two little girls who died
 here in recent years.
