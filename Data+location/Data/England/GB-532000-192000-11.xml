		<title>11SCHOOL CARETAKER</title>
		<content>                                       
 The caretaker in this school has to do
 certain jobs. He's the one who has to 
 open and close the school;he also     
 helps the cleaners tidy up the place, 
 and mends all the damaged things.     
 Sometimes somebody may come in to the 
 building and if they get lost he will 
 show them the way to go.              
 When a teacher needs something that   
 they can't get at that moment he gets 
 it for them. Our caretaker's name is  
 Mr. Hoy. He has one son. I once saw   
 him mending Miss Rich's car because it
 would not start. I guess that was in a
 bit of spare time because I know he is
 a hard working man because I hardly   
 ever see him.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
