 Junior School in Southport with 11    
 classes.There are nine classes in the

 Nursery, there are 666 children       
 altogether.The dining room has two    
 canteens, Infant and Junior.The       
 Infants have two sittings, followed by

 Hot dogs, beefburgers and sausage     
 rolls were the most popular, followed 
 by fish fingers.From the questionaire
