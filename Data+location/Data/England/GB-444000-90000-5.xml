		<content> Thorness Farm is a mixed farm.It has  
 pigs,beef and dairy cattle.It produces
 all its own animal feed in a good     
 year hay, grass and silage.It is 130  
 acres.There are 66 dairy cows and 24  
 beef cattle.The Fiesian herd gives    
 about 200 gallons of milk a day.There 
 are more than 30 sows and 3 boars.Some
 of the sows had piglets,about 13 each.
 They are kept in narrow pens so that  
 they don't squash the piglets.When the
 sows are old they are fattened for    
 sausages.Mr Attrill has lived at his  
 farm for 50 years and he has been     
 farming ever since he was old enough.
