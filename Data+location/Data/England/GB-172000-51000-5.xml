 OPEN FIRES,COOK BY A RAYBURN AND USE  
 OIL LAMPS.                            
 EVERY ONE NOW HAS RUNNING WATER BUT   
 A FEW STILL HAVE WELLS THAT ARE IN    
 USE.VERY FEW HOUSES IN THE AREA HAVE  
 MAINS DRAINAGE AND THERE IS NO MAINS  
 GAS.APART FROM A FEW HAMLETS AND SMALL

 HOUSES ARE SCATTERED.MANY OF THE      
 COTTAGES ARE WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS
