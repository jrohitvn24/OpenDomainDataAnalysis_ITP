		<content>            { POOH STICKS}             
  Pooh sticks is a game that you play  
 with friends. You have to go somewhere
 were there is a river with a bridge.  
 You get a stick each and throw it in  
 the water in ith same place. The stic 
 that comes out first on the other side
 is the winner.                        
             {RED LETTER}              
 I like the game called "Red Letter", I
 play it quite a lot. You need about 6 
 people, one to call out the letters.  
 What you have to do is get from one   
 end of the playground to the other,   
 you can take a step each time the     
 caller sayes a letter in your name but
 if you move on the {RED LETTER}(which 
 you decide on at the start) you have  
 to go back to the biginning. you must 
 not move on the {RED LETTER}even if it
 is in your name.
