		<content>{Villages of Grimoldby, South          
{Cockerington and part of Manby and    
{Stewton, Lincolnshire                 
 This area is cultivated marshland     
 between the Lincolnshire Wolds and the
 North Sea. The Wolds are 4 miles to   
 the West and the sea coast is 6 miles 
 to the East. Height of land above sea 
 level varies between 20 feet and 65   
 feet. The soil is heavy clay and has  
 to be drained artificially into dykes 
 and thence to small rivers which drain
 into the sea.                         
 Although there are local workers many 
 residents work in the nearest market  
 town of Louth 6 miles to the North    
 West. Others commute to Grimsby or    
 Lincoln and a few fly to North Sea gas
 rigs.                                 
 The number of pensioners retiring to  
 this area is increasing and most      
 houses are owner occupied.            </content>
