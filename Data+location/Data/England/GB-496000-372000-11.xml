 St. Mary's school was given two       
 separate kilometer square blocks to   
 survey. These were Block 9872 (A) and 
 Block 9972 (B). We made up            
 questionnaires to see the difference  
 in lifestyle between the blocks.  20  
 householders from each block were     
 interviewed.  Here are the results.   
 HOUSES:                               
 People in Block A were better off than
 in Block B. Block A were private      
 detached and semi-detached houses and 
 bungalows. Block B consisted of a mix 
 of private and council, semi-detached 
 and terraced houses.  On average a    
 person living in Block A had 2.5      
 rooms, compared to Block B with 1.7   
 rooms.
