This year at St.Peters Church,there was
a Flower Festival.The last one was held
15 years ago.Mrs.Wain organised it but 
everyone put there fair share of work  
i}n.There were beautiful arrangements  
of flowers in the church,and it looked 
lovely.There were concerts and services
in which St.Peters Church choir took   
part in (I was in it)we sang anthems   
and hymns on Saturday 29th June and    
Sunday 30th June.The Howard School     
also  took part in the service telling 
the  story of St.Peter in words and    
music.  The school did some maypole    
dancing and after each service or      
concert,there was                      
scones,biscuits,coffee and orange      
squashsh  in a marquee.There was also  
a plant stall and a cake stall.The     
2000 pounds made went to St.Giles      
Hospice in Whittinton.                 </content>
