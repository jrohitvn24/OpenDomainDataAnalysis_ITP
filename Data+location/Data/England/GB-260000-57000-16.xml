		<title>16The Fardel stone,Cornwood</title>
		<content> The British Museum houses a granite   
 standing-stone,known as the Fardel    
 stone,which bears inscriptions both in
 Latin &amp; Ogham(the written representa- 
 tion of the sign language of the      
 Druids,priests to the Celts) The stone
 is probably mid 5th century.It was    
 discovered in the 186O's forming part 
 of a culvert over a stream flowing to 
 Fardel Manor.The stone is linked to   
 the manor by the locally known couplet
 "Between this stone and Fardel Hall,  
  Lies more money than the Devil can   
 haul"(a poss. ref.to treasure buried  
 during the Civil War) Tradition has it
 that the field,containing this gold,  
 must never be ploughed,or untold evil 
 will be released and by the following 
 morning the furrows will have been    
 turned back into the earth.Mr.Dennis  
 (Fardel farm)says there is no truth in
 the curse,but of the gold..'who knows'</content>
