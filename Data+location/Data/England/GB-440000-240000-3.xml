		<title>03Guides collect the `Flame'</title>
		<content>On Wednesday June 26th 1985, ten of the
3rd Banbury Guides went with Chil our  
company leader, to the canal moorings  
at Spiceball Park, Banbury to meet the 
Rangers who were bringing "The Flame   
of Friendship" from Oxford. At the     
canalside were Guides and Brownies     
from local companies. Whilst they      
waited, on this overcast evening, for  
the boat to arrive, each group played  
their own games. When the boat came    
into sight everybody cheered and       
clapped. Chil, who is also District    
Commissioner went on board to collect  
the " Flame". With the it she lit the  
candles on the cakes which each        
company had brought. When the candles  
had gone out the cakes were eaten and  
every one returned home. Chil then had 
to keep the Â£Flame' alight for three   
more days. To do this she used a       
hurricane lamp.                        </content>
