		<content> When our Catholic Church called       
 Our Lady of Mount Carmel was first    
 built in 1892 it was a school but in  
 1977 it had to close because of the   
 falling pupil rolls.The building then 
 became the Church.The priest is Father
 John Glyn who has been in charge for 5
 years.His Congregation is about 100   
 people including children and         
 teenagers,with a small choir.They have
 a summer fete each year.The Roman     
 Catholic Bishop lives in Stock at the 
 Bishop's house but Father Glyn lives  
 in Ingatestone.Every sunday there is a
 mass at 9.30 am.In the meadowland     
 around the Catholic Church Roman      
 remains have been found.Much land in  
 Stock was owned by Lord Petre who was 
 a strong Roman Catholic.
