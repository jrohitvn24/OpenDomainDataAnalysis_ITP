		<title>04WATER EATON MANOR</title>
		<content> Water Eaton Manor was built in 1586 by
 Sir Edward Frere. At the turn of the  
 century it was partly restored        
 by G.F.Bodley, a descendant of Sir    
 Thomas Bodley who built the Bodleian  
 Library.At the front of the garden at 
 each corner there are two guest houses
 built in 1661.Guests of the Manor used
 to sleep there and at one time King   
 Charles 1 stayed in one of them.They  
 are each three storeys high.          
  Now Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer and their two
 children live in the Manor which has  
 lots of lovely Jacobean oak panelling.
