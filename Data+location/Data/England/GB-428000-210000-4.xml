		<content>The village of Minster Lovell is       
steeped in history. The old Manor House
is outside our area but the "new" part 
of the village, in which most people   
live has a history of its own.  In the 
1840's, a man called Fergus O'Connor   
bought some land and built a number of 
small cottages,each with 2 to 4 acres  
of land. This was a self-sufficiency   
idea to help many poor people from the 
midlands provide for themslves. There  
was also a political motive behind the 
scheme and it was partly this that     
prevented the project being a success. 
Many of the original houses remain and 
protection orders have been placed on  
them.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
