		<title>04WOBURN PARK :1</title>
		<content> The park surrounding Woburn Abbey is  
 extremely impressive. It covers some  
 3000 acres and was originally laid    
 down by Repton, being a mix of        
 deciduous and coniferous woodland and 
 extensive grassland. It has held a    
 number of herds of deer since earlier 
 this century, some now extremely rare 
 breeds and virtually saved from       
 extinction by breeding at Woburn.     
                                       
 The park has held a great variety of  
 activities, in fact these have been   
 held since long before the more       
 commercial attitude of recent years.  
 There have been car hill climbs, game 
 fairs, specialist car meetings,       
 caravan rallies and a host of other   
 activities.
