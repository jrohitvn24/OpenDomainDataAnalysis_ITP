		<title>14THE WESLEYAN CHAPEL</title>
		<content> The Chapel is a small brick{building} 
 at the northern end of Souldrop high  
 street.  It was built in 1912 to      
 replace the sheet steel hut that      
 previously stood on the site.  (The   
 original Chapel was a temporary       
 building constructed in 1838 on a     
 different site.)                      
                                       
{Services}take place on Sundays at     
 2.45pm and are usually taken by the   
 Rev. Taplin from Rushden.  Some       
 of the{congregation}come from         
 outside the village -there being only 
 two methodist families in the         
 village now.                          
                                       
 The Chapel features a locally carved  
 stone{font}and a{pulpit}engraved "God 
 is Love - Rock of Ages"
