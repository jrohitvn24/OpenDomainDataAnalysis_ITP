		<title>18COMMUNITY LIFE:BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   The community life tends to be very 
 strong but of,necessity,inward        
 looking. The population is 300 of     
 which 100 are children.About 30       
 organisations meet in either the      
 Church Hall or the Social Club        
 which is open every evening and also  
 used in the day by a Playgroup and    
 even a mens hairdresser.The publican  
 who is leaving the well-kept pub,said 
 that the village people rarely use it.
   To date about Â£30000 has been raised
 by the village for the Church         
 Restoration Appeal and many activities
 are still continuing,on an annual     
 basis.There is an annual water-sports 
 festival(including wind-surfing)which 
 is popular locally.Bere Barton(a      
 castellated manor house with a garde  
 robe and grounds sloping to the       
 river)has a summer fete and several   
 farmers hold a Farm Tea with stalls.  </content>
