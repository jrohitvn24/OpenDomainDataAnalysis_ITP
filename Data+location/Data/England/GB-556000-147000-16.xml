		<title>16AN OLD LADY FROM TONBRIDGE:2</title>
		<content>  "When I was 9 years old in 1917 I    
 lived in a 2 bedroomed house in Ton-  
 bridge.The house was lit by oil lamps 
 and our water came from a well in the 
 back garden.                          
  "My name was Ada Yates then.My father
 was killed in the 1914-18 war so my   
 mother had to do more and more work   
 every day with 6 children to bring up.
  "I had a very close friend the same  
 age as me who lived in London and we  
 wrote to each other nearly every day. 
 What with the war,and money being     
 short,our letters took a long time to 
 get to each other.One day she wrote to
 me and said that in her road a Zepp-  
 elin had made a hole the size of a    
 bus.Now I am over 70 I like to have a 
 lie-in late in the mornings.I live    
 with just my husband.Our daughter is  
 married and has moved away.She often  
 comes and helps with the shopping."   </content>
