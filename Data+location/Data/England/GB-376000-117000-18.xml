		<title>18Marnhull:Hardy and Tess.</title>
		<content>  In 1877,during his two-year residence
 at Sturminster Newton,Thomas Hardy    
 recorded,'May 30.Walked to Marnhull'. 
 On that day,the last Wednesday in May,
 Marnhull Friendly Society held its    
 Club Day with a procession,dancing and
 feast at the Crown Inn.Hardy's novel, 
 Tess of the D'Urbevilles,published in 
 1891,uses Club-walking round Marlott  
 (Marnhull)to The Pure Drop as the     
 starting point from which Tess        
 Durbeyfield,(a pure woman),dressed in 
 white,is persuaded against her        
 judgements to leave her native village
 to restore the fortunes of her once-  
 noble family.                         
  There are several glimpses of life   
 in C.19th Marlott.Tess returns to have
 her baby and later to assist her sick 
 parents. Symbolic links with the scene
 at the Pure Drop can be found in the  
 final'sacrifice'of Tess at Stonehenge.</content>
