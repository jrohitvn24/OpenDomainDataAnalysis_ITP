 "The Ancient Wall and Gateway"        
                                       
 One interesting feature of the farm is
 an "ancient" wall and gateway near the
 entrance to the farm.                 
 Mr Day showed the gateway to the      
 teachers and children and asked them  
 how old they thought it was. The      
 gateway was covered in ivy and moss   
 and looked at least 400 years old.    
 The History teacher with the group    
 looked at the stonework and said "This
 must date back to Tudor times".       
 Mr Day smiled. "Nearly right," he     
 said."That wall and gate were built in
 1953. Some farm workers who had just  
 been made redundant put it up to earn 
 a bit of extra cash. Nevertheless it's
 been listed as an ancient building."
