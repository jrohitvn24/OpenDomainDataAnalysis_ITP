		<content> PLODDY HOUSE (CONT FROM PAGE 13)      
 The land owned by Mr.Davison is       
 capable of growing only certain       
 crops, so they grow potatoes,         
 sugar-beet and wheat. They sell their 
 crops to merchants except for the     
 sugar-beet which is sold to sugar-beet
 factories where it is made into sugar.
 The price they get for the sugar-beet 
 depends upon the sugar content of the 
 beet. Whereas the price for their     
 cereals doesn't vary that much because
 the European Economic Community       
 maintains a minimum selling price to  
 the farmers.                          
 To maximize yields fertilizers and    
 pesticides are used although generally
 in small amounts. The reason being    
 that they are expensive to buy and    
 also to avoid pollution of the local  
 water courses.                        
                                       </content>
