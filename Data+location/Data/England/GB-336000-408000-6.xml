   The farms and cottages have Mains   
Electricity and we found a             
sub-station, but there are no mains    
sewers.  Most of the farms have their  
own septic tanks, but one or two       
cottages still have no water closets at
all.                                   
   Water towers are still a common     
sight in this low-lying area, but as   
more houses are connected to the Mains 
so they are falling into disuse.  We   
found only one and that not in use.    
   For heating coal and gas are used.  
Some people use oil-stoves for cooking,
others electricity.  There is no gas in
this area, but some people we spoke to 
told us they hope it will be soon      
brought in.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
