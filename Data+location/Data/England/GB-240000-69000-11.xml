		<title>11Scrap Metals - Tamar Valley</title>
		<content>     The Scrap yard at Greenhill is run
 by a merchant, Mr. Henry Flashman.  He
 has  a  fairly large range of machines
 such  as  car crushers, wheel crushers
 and   cranes  including  standard  and
 electro-magnetic  ones.  He  also  has
 a grab  for ripping out engine blocks.
 Once the car is crushed  into a block,
 it is  sent  to Cardiff  to be  melted
 down and recycled.  Engine blocks  are
 sent  to  the  Midlands,to be re-used.
 All hard steels  are sent to Spain via
 Millbay Docks  at Plymouth.  After the
 wheels are crushed  the tyres are sold
 to local  farmers  to  hold  down  the
 polythene sheets covering their silage
 pits.  Mr. Flashman  generates his own
 electricity for his machinery  and has
 two  large  generators  and  a smaller
 one, with  which  he  claims  he could
 supply  the  whole  of Gunnislake  and
 Calstock with electricity if needed.  </content>
