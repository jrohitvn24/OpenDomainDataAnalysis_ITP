		<title>14The W.I's view of Singleton</title>
		<content>  The Women's Institute is basically a 
 united party of women,who aim to      
 improve the position of women in      
 society.The English section of the    
 W.I. was founded in Charlton,near West
 Dean,in November,1915.                
  The area covered by Singleton(and    
 West Dean) is approx. 3 square        
 miles.There are two farms in the      
 area,the largest being Manor          
 Farm,which recently sold its entire   
 stock of dairy cattle,in favour of    
 cereal farming.                       
  The highest hill in the area is      
 St. Roche's hill,which is topped by   
 the triangulation point(206 metres    
 above sea level).                     
  There is one school in Singleton,and 
 one in West Dean.                     
  The two villages can be reached via  
 the A286,Town Lane and Charlton Road.
