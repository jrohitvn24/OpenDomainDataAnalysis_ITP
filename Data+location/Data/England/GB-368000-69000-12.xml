		<title>12Quarry Wildlife</title>
		<content> Birds such as crows, blackbirds, owls 
 and kestrels all make nests in the    
 quarry right next to my house.  This  
 makes it a wonderful place for        
 birdwatchers.  The problem with       
 birdwatchers is that when a pair of   
 kestrels came to nest a few years ago 
 people climbed down the quarry to get 
 a better look at them and frightened  
 the birds away.  There used to be     
 little owls in the quarry but the     
 birdwatchers scared them away too.    
 People come from all over the country 
 to look for rare birds on Portland.   
 A lot of bunnies live in the quarries 
 too and I can see them and their      
 burrows from my bedroom if I use      
 binoculars.  Snakes such as adders and
 grass snakes also live in the quarries
 but they are not seen very often, not 
 unless the day has been very warm.
