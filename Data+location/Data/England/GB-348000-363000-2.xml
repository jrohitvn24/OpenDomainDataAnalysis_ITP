   The major land use is intensively   
 managed grassland used for{dairy      
{farming.}Situated in the Cheshire     
 Plain this area is characterised by   
 large dairy farms, mainly of freisian 
 herds.  Some farms have increased     
 their land area in recent years       
 through the acquistion of neighbouring
 farmland.  The surplus farmhouses and 
 tied accommodation have often been    
 sold and subsequently renovated for   
 private usage, often by commuters to  
 the larger towns and cities outside of
 this area.                            
                                       
   In addition to the large area of    
 dairy farming there are small areas   
 used for the{rotational cropping of   
{grass, corn and potatoes.}There are   
 also{smallholdings}and areas of       
{horticultural land. }                 </content>
