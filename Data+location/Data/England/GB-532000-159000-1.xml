		<content>    On Tuesday 4th of June we          
 interviewed some older people in      
 Kenley Memorial Hall.We asked them    
 some questions about the past.'This is
 good 'an old lady said.When we asked  
 her about school she said most people 
 liked it,but you had to go home for   
 dinner as the school wouldn't supply  
 it.Children were treated well.        
    Today people have more money .There
 weren't any real jobs for girls but   
 you could be a servant for Â£16:00 a   
 year .                                
 When the lady I interviewed was young 
 you could buy 2 packets of sweets for 
 a ha'penny and a loaf of bread too.   
   Many of the old people remembered   
 the rations that they had during      
 World War II .There were 2oz of       
 butter ,half a pound of flour and     
 small pieces of meat.
