 Our local paper has had front         
 page stories of the problem at the    
 docks.The workers have been angry with
 the new owner who made comments about 
 the workface when he {outlined }new   
 proposals for the yard.The men thought
 that his comments would bring         
 embarrasment to their families.       
       The docks have recently been    
 employing just over {400  men,}and    
 have had plenty of work.              
   A few years ago, over {1000}men     
 worked at the docks.Because so many   
 have been made redundant, {Falmouth}  
 has had a big unemployment            
 problem.Jobs are still hard to find.
