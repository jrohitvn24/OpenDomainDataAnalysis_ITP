		<title>10A SOIL SAMPLE EXPERIMENT</title>
		<content>  (AIM) To test Arthur Young's ideas on
 soil in Collier Row in 1807.          
  (METHOD) We got a spade and went to  
 the garden. We dug about 30cm. At     
 first we found that the soil was loamy
 and we found fine particles of sand   
 and gravel. When we dug a bit further 
 down the soil started to get harder.  
 When we dug the full length we found  
 that it was completely solid and wet. 
 It was tightly packed with clay.      
  (RESULTS) We found that there are two
 types of soil in Collier Row:1)The top
 soil is loamy, 2) The bottom is clay. 
  (CONCLUSION) The scientist Arthur    
 Young was right in saying that Collier
 Row had two types of soil as our test 
 showed.
