		<title>17The Katyn Memorial.</title>
		<content>    The Katyn Memorial is on Cannock   
Chase opposite a little cafe called    
Springslade Lodge.                     
    The memorial a large stone on a    
low platform. There were several poppy 
wreaths around the base. On the stone  
is a plaque explaining the purpose of  
the memorial. On the front of the      
platform is the badge of the Polish    
White Eagle.                           
    The memorial commemorates the      
14,000 members of the Polish Armed     
Forces and professional people who     
were massacred and buried in a mass    
grave by German Forces in 1940 in the  
Katyn Forest, Poland, an area not      
unlike the place where this memorial   
stands.                                
    The Memorial was erected by the    
Anglo - Polish Society.
