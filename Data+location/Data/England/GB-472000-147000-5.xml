		<content> WHEN WE ASKED PEOPLE WHAT             
 WAS THE THING THAT THEY               
 WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IN OUR BLOCK     
 NEARLY EVERYONE SAID THAT THEY WERE   
 CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF HOUSE   
 BUILDING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.THEY WERE  
 CONCERNED IN CASE A BIG BUILDER LIKE  
 BARRETT GOT PERMISSION TO BUILD LOTS  
 AND LOTS OF HOUSES BECAUSE THERE ARE  
 LOTS OF NEW HOUSES BEING BUILT IN     
 VILLAGES NEARBY AND PEOPLE WERE       
 CONCERNED IN CASE THEY WERE BUILT IN  
 OUR AREA. PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WOULD   
 SPOIL THE AREA. OTHER PEOPLE WERE     
 CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT AS A 
 PETROL COMPANY WAS DRILLING FOR OIL IN
 OUR AREA,THERE WOULD BE HORRIBLE      
 DERRICKS AND OTHER OIL DRILLING       
 OBJECTS ERECTED AND A LOT OF HEAVY    
 LORRIES AND PIPES,IF OIL WAS FOUND.   
                                       
                                       </content>
