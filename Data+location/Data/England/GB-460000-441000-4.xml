		<title>04Ecology, Escrick area.</title>
		<content> The soil in our area ranges from being
 peaty and bog-like in poorly drained  
 parts to boulder clay on the Escrick  
 moraine which stretches from Cawood to
 Wheldrake.Most of the land cover is   
 arable farmland,and has been          
 drained.During World War 2 the land   
 which had been grassland was          
 intensively farmed,with drainage      
 subsidies providing an incentive to   
 drain and cultivate the land.A beck   
 which flows through Escrick has been  
 deepened and widened,and a flood      
 barrier built at Stillingfleet has    
 helped,but not stopped,flooding in the
 area.The water in the beck is         
 constantly tested for chemical        
 build-up.The local farmers are        
 conscious of the need to conserve     
 woodland and hedges which  act as     
 wind breaks,and which also give       
 shelter to many species of wildlife.  </content>
