		<title>15WORDSLEY CARNIVAL</title>
		<content>    In 1946 a small garden party was   
 held in{King George V park,           
{Wordsley.}This led to the{Wordsley    
{Gala}which was run by the Old People's
 Welfare until 1976. The event was     
 then taken over by{Holy Trinity       
{Church}in 1977 and they called it     
{"Wordsley Carnival."                  
    A procession takes place through   
 the streets of{Wordsley}after which   
 the carnival begins. There are about  
 70 floats taking part. The procession 
 is the biggest in the West Midlands.  
 There are many different types of     
 stalls and numerous interesting events
 taking place in the large arena.      
    There is also a fun fair which     
 shows a lot of goodwill to the people 
 of{Wordsley}by offering free rides to 
 the handicapped.                      
    The money raised is given to needy 
 charities and local churches.         </content>
