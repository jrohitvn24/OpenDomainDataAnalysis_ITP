		<content> The Weathering Station is owned by    
 Tioxide International who are the     
 second largest TI02 pigment           
 manufacturer in the world.This station
 is the largest site in Europe for     
 testing pigment and paint.It was moved
 away from the poluted air of          
 Billingham to the present open field  
 site in 1957.Mr Oakley has run the    
 station since its opening.There are   
 only 4 people employed there now.Paint
 is tested for many companies including
 I.C.I and CROWN.28,000 samples of     
 paint,mainly blue and white,are       
 exposed to the weather on rows of     
 racks.They test paint on different    
 materials such as wood,metal,plastic  
 and concrete (The racks facing North  
 are wetter and mouldier) The          
 information is used by the technical  
 services department and the research  
 chemists.The oldest paint is 15 years.</content>
