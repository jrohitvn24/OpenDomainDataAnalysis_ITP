		<content> This block covers the village of      
 Nocton and part of the village of     
 Dunston.These are both rural villages,
 approximately 8 miles south east of   
 the city of Lincoln.                  
        Dunston is an attractive       
 village with a mixture of old stone   
 built houses and small developments.  
 Many people commute to Lincoln and    
 Sleaford for their work.The figure for
 Dunston in the 1981 census was 491.   
     Nocton is also a pleasant village.
 Many of the houses are old and there  
 are no new developments.The figure for
 Nocton in the last census was 1008 but
 this figure has been greatly reduced  
 by the closure of RAF Nocton Hall     
 Hospital.                             
       Much of the land surrounding the
 villages is owned by Nocton Farms,a   
 large farming concern.The land is     
 generally very flat.                  </content>
