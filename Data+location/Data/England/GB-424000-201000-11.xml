		<title>11Work at Langford School</title>
		<content>  The children do Mathematics nearly   
every day. They work from text books   
which have the problems set out for    
them and they have to work out the     
answers.The older children have to     
learn their tables.(eg.6 x 7 =42).The  
children also do maths while doing     
Topic Work or some form of problem     
solving. Calculators are sometimes used
to help the children.                  
  Every term the children in each of   
the classes do their Topic Work.For    
this they will have to study History,  
Geography and Science. They might take 
a theme like Transport and look at many
different aspects of it especially     
those which are in their own area.They 
would make visits to places and write  
about what they saw.They would look    
things up in books and watch programmes
on the television about their theme.   
Their work might go on the class walls.</content>
