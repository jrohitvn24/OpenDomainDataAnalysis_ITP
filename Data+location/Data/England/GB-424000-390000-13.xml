		<title>13THE SCHOOL AT BRADFIELD</title>
		<content> In 1864 the old school was swept away 
 by the Sheffield Flood.A new school   
{was built on the present site costing 
  bout Â£800,paid by Sheffield          
  aterworks Company as compensation.   
 When it opened in 1867 there were 45  
 boys &amp; 18 girls.14 were free scholars.
 Fees were 3d_4d per week.Free         
 education came in 1891 &amp; in 1901 there
 were 113 pupils.In 1904 the West      
 Riding County Council became          
 responsible for the school.From 1932  
 the pupils transferred at the age of  
 11 to Loxley Council School &amp; the C.of
 E. School at High Bradfield closed &amp;  
 children attended Low Bradfield       
 School.In 1974 Sheffield Education    
 Department took over the school.Now in
 July 1985 it is due to close because  
 of low numbers much to the regret of  
 the entire community which fought to  
 keep it open.                         </content>
