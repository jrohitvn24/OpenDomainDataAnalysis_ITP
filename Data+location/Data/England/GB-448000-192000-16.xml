		<content>    At the weekend our family usually  
 goes their separate ways. I play      
 football matches on Sundays and the   
 rest of the time I go round my friends
 house. My Dad always has lots of jobs 
 to do around the house or in the      
 garden. My Mum stays in and does the  
 housework and gets our dinner. My     
 oldest sister spends a lot of time    
 watching videos on the TV. But she    
 also visits her friends house to play 
 a lot. My brother is always round his 
 friends house or has someone round our
 house to play. And my youngest sister 
 is either sleeping or playing with her
 dolls. This isn't the same every      
 weekend though. On the odd weekend we 
 go on trips, all go to a friends house
 and sometimes we go to adventure      
 parks, air shows and safari parks.
