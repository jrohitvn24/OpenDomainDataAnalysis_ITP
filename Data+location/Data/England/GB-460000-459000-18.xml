		<title>18Strensall School - Changes</title>
		<content>{The Robert Wilkinson Voluntary        
{Controlled Primary School, Strensall  
 has seen many changes during the last 
 40 years.  The number of pupils has   
 risen from{150 to 300. }Until 1972 the
 school was housed in a Victorian      
 building with four classrooms, each   
 holding an average of 40 children.    
 There was{no hot water and the toilets
{were outside. }P.E. was taken in the  
 playground resulting in many grazed   
 knees.  There was no playing field.   
 Sports Day was held on the road       
 outside the school.  Boys with        
 whistles stood on each corner to warn 
 of oncoming traffic.  Later, P.E. was 
 done in the Village Hall and Sports   
 Day was held on a field a mile away.  
 The first school secretary was        
 appointed in 1960, working in the     
 Headteacher's room which was so       
{overcrowded}people walked on the desks</content>
