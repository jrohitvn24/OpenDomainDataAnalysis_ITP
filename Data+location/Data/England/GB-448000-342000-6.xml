		<content>   Babbington is a small hamlet. It is 
 a dead end, though it can be reached  
 by footpaths and bridleways.          
   The houses in Babbington were once  
 miner's cottages. We talked to        
 Mrs.Doolin who lives in one of the    
 houses. Her house used to be called   
 the pump house because it used to have
 a pump in the cellar which pumped     
 water into a culvert. The water had to
 be pumped out of the mine to stop it  
 flooding. The hamlet once had a{chapel
 which has been pulled down now.       
   Although the{mine}has been closed   
 for many years, people in the cottages
 still find pit shafts by their houses.
 These have to be capped by the        
 coalboard, because they are dangerous.
