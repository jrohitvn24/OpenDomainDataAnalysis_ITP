  At 10.00 it's assembly. This ends at 
 10.30, then we go straight out to     
 play. After play we write a story.    
 Usually we are told what to write     
 about. At 12.15 we go to dinner, and  
 play outside until 1.15. In the       
 afternoon we work on topics or science
 or Religilous Education. We have      
 another playtime at 2.15, do more work
 or hear a story, and go home at 3.30. 
 I walk home with my friend, and if    
 it's not raining I go to her house.   
  I amuse myself until 6.30. This is my
 tea time. After tea I watch           
 "Coronation Street" and "Dallas" on   
 the television, and then I go to bed. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
