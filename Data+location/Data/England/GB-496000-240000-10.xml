		<content> The church of St. Mary is a noteworthy
 building with a separate tower 50 feet
 away.Legend has it that it was thrown 
 there by the devil, but it does have  
 thick walls, a 1st storey door and a  
 well inside implying it may have been 
 defensive.                            
 The old Marston and Lidlington School 
 in the village was built in 1847.Today
 it is a Grade 2 Listed building and   
 was owned by Target Craft (archery)   
 after it ceased use as a school.Since 
 September 1985 it has been converted  
 into The Village School Residential   
 Home for the Elderly.Additional       
 buildings have been added to form a   
 courtyard at the back to provide      
 accommodation for 20 residents who are
 cared for by 17 staff- many employed  
 from the village.The Rectory building 
 has a moat and the only surviving     
 dovehouse in the parish.              </content>
