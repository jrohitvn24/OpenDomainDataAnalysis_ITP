		<content>   The dogs were supposed to follow the
 scent but something went wrong and    
 they took the wrong route.After about 
 ten minutes{Eddie Stacey}came and told
 us all about himself.He even showed us
 pictures out of his book.             
   He showed us a picture of him doing 
 a jump in a very old car,and the way  
 to pull an horse to ground.He even    
 told us about when he practiced so    
 much for a stunt but in the end he    
 could not do it because he was talking
 to someone and when he stepped back he
 fell over a lamp and damaged his leg  
 for three months.                     
   Then we all got his autograph       
 before we had to go home.
