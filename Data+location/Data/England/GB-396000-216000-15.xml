		<title>15WOODLAND MANAGEMENT</title>
		<content>   Logging makes a little money because
 it is along term process. If the wood 
 was chopped down all at once no money 
 would be made the next year. Very     
 little labour is used. Trees are being
 replanted but they take 50-60 years to
 grow.                                 
  Most of the woods are parts of       
 estates. Shooting makes more money    
 much more quickly. Pheasants are the  
 main sport. They are bred each year.  
  Not all of the woods are intensively 
 used like this. A couple of the woods 
 are being neglected. They are hardly  
 used at all. In these woods are found 
 things like orchids which are quiet   
 rare. Sometimes there are a few deer  
 but there seem to be many foxes and   
 rabbits.                              
  The unused woods seem to be mainly   
 ash. The intensively used woods are   
 broadleaved and conifers.             </content>
