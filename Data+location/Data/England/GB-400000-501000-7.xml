		<title>07VILLAGES IN THE DALE</title>
		<content> Most of the dwellings in our area are 
 in the very small villages of{Booze,  
{Langthwaite, and Arkle Town.}The      
 largest village, Langthwaite, has a   
 mere 42 houses and only 15 are lived  
 in permanently. The remaining houses  
 are used as holiday cottages except   
 for two which are empty.              
   In recent years many film makers    
 have used Langthwaite and nearby      
 properties because of their old-world 
 charm. The site of Langthwaite dates  
 back to{Viking times}from where it    
 gained its name. Most of the village  
 nestles between the river and         
 the steep wooded hillside.  Many of   
 the houses were built in the{17th     
{century}around an open central area   
 which is still partly cobbled.  The   
 only way into Langthwaite is across   
 an old picturesque stone bridge over  
 the river.                            </content>
