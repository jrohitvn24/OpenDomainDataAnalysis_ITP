		<content>      The conservation area at Bentley 
 Heath School was the idea of the then 
 Deputy Head, Richard Edwards. Staff,  
 parents and children helped to        
 develope a haven for plants and       
 wildlife that is being affected by new
 housing on adjacent green field sites 
 (The countryside around Bently Heath  
 is mentioned is the famous book:"A    
 Country Diary Of An Edwardian Lady" by
 Edith Holden).                        
      The area covers 0.4 acres and was
 opened by the Mayor of Solihull, Mrs  
 Miriam Harris on July 18th, 1983. The 
 area has been a stimulus for work in  
 Art, Science, Mathematics and English 
 and adjacent classrooms huts form good
 vantage points. In July 1985, 10 new  
 bungalows are being built right next  
 to the area which 2 Mallards have just
 started to visit.
