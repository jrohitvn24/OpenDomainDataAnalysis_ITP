		<title>02A TEACHER LIVING IN CRADLEY</title>
		<content> She comes from a Welsh family. She    
 lives in Cradley in a modern brick    
 house with 4 bedrooms and 2           
 bathrooms.Living with her are her     
 mother and mother-in-law,both widows. 
 Her husband is Second Master at the   
 John Masefield Comprehensive School in
 Ledbury and her 22 year old son       
 works for an oil company.She teaches  
 at Bosbury School.Her interests are   
 gardening and singing with the Cradley
 Singers.Since she has lived here      
 Cradley has been built up a lot with  
 new housing estates.She doesn't like  
 driving around Cradley because of the 
 sharp bends and narrow lanes.Her      
 favourite programmes are documentaries
 and thrillers.In her opinion children 
 are the same as they have always been 
 but the fashions suit children more.
