 The M.E.E. Club is for the young      
 people of 3 churches, St Mawgan, St   
 Eval and St Ervan hence the name.It   
 started 4 years ago by the Rev.       
 M.Peters, Mrs.Blizard and Mrs.Surridge
 It meets from 7.30 to 9.30pm on Sunday
 evenings. In the Summer there are out 
 door activities such as swimming,     
 tennis  and barbecues.In the Winter   
 it is held at The Rectory or at Mrs   
 Blizards house where they play games, 
 have parties or hear guest speakers   
 from organisations such as the NSPCC. 
 The group have spent 2 adventure      
 weekends at a Christian Youth Hostel  
 on the Lizard and in 1984 went on an  
 exchange visit with a group of young  
 people from Germany visiting such     
 places as Hamburg and Berlin.The      
 Germans will visit St Mawgan in       
 October 1985.                         </content>
