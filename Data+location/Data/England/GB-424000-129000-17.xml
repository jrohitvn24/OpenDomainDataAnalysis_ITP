		<content> Most people in West Tytherley are     
 members of the Church of England      
 though some are Methodists.There is   
 the Parish Church of St.Peter's with  
 the Methodist Chapel nearby.The two   
 cooperate. The Rev.John Page is Vicar 
 of Lockerley,East Dean,East and West  
 Tytherley.About 15 people attend the  
 church regularly and 12 children go to
 Sunday School.At Easter,Harvest and   
 Christmas many attend the services,   
 though Harvest Service is biennial.   
  The 3 bells in the church are not    
 rung because they are unsafe but a    
 fine clock is maintained by           
 Mr.P.Dawkins.  There are plenty of    
 helpers to decorate and clean the     
 church which is unlocked for visitors 
 Fetes raise around Â£800 at this time. 
 Religious beliefs are fundamental in  
 the community,particularly the elderly
