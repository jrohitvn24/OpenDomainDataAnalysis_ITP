		<title>05Local History of Bognor</title>
		<content> The Saxons probably called Bognor     
 Boecgo-Nor.Then it became Bognor      
 Rocks.  {                             
  Until the 1790's Bognor Rocks used to
 be a little fishing town. The         
 smugglers used it to import goods. {  
{Sir Richard Hotham}was the founder of 
 Bognor.He built the{Dome House,       
{Spencer Terrace, Mordington }and      
{St.Michaels}which made up Hothampton  
 Cresent in the 1790's.He also built   
 an {Ice House }and a {Chapel House.   
{King George}stayed in Bognor in 1929  
 because he was very ill.He came over  
 because people said Bognor is a place 
 where he could recover.Then he said   
 Bognor would be called Bognor{Regis } 
 in honour of his stay and recovery.
