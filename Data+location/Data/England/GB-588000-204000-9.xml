		<title>09       FARM MACHINERY</title>
		<content>                                       
  In the last 40 years the use of      
 machinery has been the major change in
 farming.As recently as 1953,when the  
 present family bought Freshfields,all 
 of the work was done by man power and 
 horse power.In 1953 to run the 600    
 acre farm 14 agricultural labourers   
 were employed-now only one man is     
 employed.This is partly due to the use
 of machinery and partly due to the    
 move from dairy farming to the growing
 of cereal crops.                      
   Farmers today have lots of large and
 expensive machinery such as combine   
 harvesters and tractors with parts    
 that attach on the back like crop     
 sprayers and ploughs.                 
   They have their own machinery as    
 they would all want to rent the same  
 equipment at the same time.
