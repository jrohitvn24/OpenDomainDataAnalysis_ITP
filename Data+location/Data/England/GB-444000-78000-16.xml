		<content> Tourists seeking a quiet restful      
 holiday enjoy this part of the Isle of
 Wight.Although this area forms part of
 the{scenic route}along the South Coast
 of the island,people visit here but   
 stay in the more commercialised       
 resorts.Accommodation is available for
 about 300 people at{Atherfield Holiday
{Camp.}The majority of people staying  
 at the camp travel by coach.In early  
 season there were groups of Senior    
 Citizens and School Groups.These      
 holiday makers came from Nottingham,  
 Coventry and London.They were enjoying
 a full-board type of holiday.We found 
 no holiday homes available in this    
 area although at{Chine Farm Chalets,} 
 Winter and Summer lets were booked.   
 Farmhouse accommodation which included
 Bed/Breakfast and Evening Meal was    
 available at{Atherfield Farm House.
