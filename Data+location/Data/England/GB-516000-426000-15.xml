		<content>{Caring for the Elderly}               
 The latter part of the 20th century   
 has witnessed an increase in the      
 population of old people.This is due  
 mainly to improved diet,health care   
 and living conditions and has resulted
 in a growing social concern for the   
 care of elderly people.               
 Two important buildings in our area   
 are Holyrood House and Albemarle,both 
 situated in Baxtergate,Hedon.         
{                                      
{Albemarle} is a new purpose built home
 for old people,it was opened in 1971. 
{                                      
{Holyrood House}is an old building that
 was converted into a home for the     
 elderly in 1959.In the garden stands  
{Kilnsea Cross}which was moved in order
 to protect it from coastal erosion its
 place of origin is now covered by the 
 sea.                                  </content>
