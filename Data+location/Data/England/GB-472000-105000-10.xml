 increasing competition for the leisure
 market.Once one manufacturer thinks of

{Diadora and recently Ocean Pacific.}  
 Most of these makes are overpriced    
 e.g.Â£20 for a tee_shirt which without

 part of the booming leisure wear      
 industry.Desired brand names are{Nike,
{Adidas and Hi_Tec.}The place to buy   
 these is{Ski_Sun}in Havant.The youths 
 who wear this fashion are called {
