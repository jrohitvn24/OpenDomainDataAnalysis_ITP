		<title>05A UNIQUE GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content>  I live on top of an Anglo Saxon      
 burial ground.The burial ground is to 
 the North of Ruskington. They only dug
 eighteen inches deep. They found 7    
 skeletons. The land-area they dug was 
 about 1 acre. Some of the skeletons   
 showed traces of diseases such as     
 gum-boils &amp; root-abcesses. One skull  
 showed evidence of a mastoid abcess.  
  The graves also contained pots,      
 knives, beads, rings, brooches, keys, 
 sleeve clasps,and crystal beads.      
  One skeleton was thought to have been
 that of a girl aged between 10 and 12 
 years. Another had a bright green     
 stain on a rib, indicating that       
 something bronze had pressed down on  
 the bone.
