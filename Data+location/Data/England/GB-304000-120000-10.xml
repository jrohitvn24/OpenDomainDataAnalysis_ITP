       There is only one school in our 
 block. It is Stawley County Primary   
 School. Children up to the age of 11  
 come to our school from as far away as
 Waterrow and Wellington. In September 
 1985 we shall have 34 children in our 
 school. At the age of 11 children     
 transfer to schools in Wellington or  
 Wiveliscombe.                         
       We have two main classrooms, one
 for Infants and one for Juniors. There
 is also a building which is used as   
 half office and half library. Soon    
 there will be another room ready for  
 us to use for exhibitions.            
       Our school rabbit lives in the  
 Pet House and we are expecting more   
 animals to arrive in September.       
       We have a school kitchen where  
 lovely meals are cooked and we have a 
 swimming pool.                        </content>
