		<content>  This area is in a rural part of{North
{Yorkshire.}Most of the land is arable.
 The rest is mainly woodland and       
 pasture,grazed by cattle  and sheep.  
 There is a very busy trunk road which 
 runs in a North/South direction. It is
 called the{A.1.}and it is a dual      
 carriageway.The river{Nidd}meanders   
 through the South of the area on its  
 way to join the {Ouse.}To the North a 
 railway line runs in an East/West     
 direction.It is a single track line   
 which goes from Leeds to York.There is
 a local bus service which travels     
 between York and Wetherby.Other bus   
 services use the A.1.There  are only 2
 small villages where most of the      
 people live,{Hunsingore }and{         
{Walshford}.The others live on farms.  
 The nearest town is {Wetherby},5      
 miles to the South.A footbridge across
 the{Nidd}joins{Hunsingore}to Cowthorpe</content>
