 The general{landscape}is of gentle    
 rolling hills.The area is principally 
{farming}particularly dairy farming.So 
 much of the land is pasture land.There
 is a small industrial or commercial   
 site at the bottom of the village.The 
 site is now being develaped further to
 include more {industrial units.}      
 Besides the industrial units there is 
 the {railway line},the main one       
 between Exeter and Barnstaple .There  
 use to be a stock yard next to the    
 railway station.Running by the railway
 line is the {River Yeo}.Around the    
 village is mostly fields.There are    
 houses now  on Kelland Hill which has 
 changed the landscape.A large new {   
{housing }estate on Highfield was built
 twelve years ago.
