		<title>08CHILWELL. Local History.</title>
		<content> Mr Hinton came to talk to us about    
 Chilwell.                             
 Mr Hinton said he came to Meadow Lane 
 School when he was four. He is 80     
 years old. He said Chilwell was a very
 little village and there were no buses
 or cars and not many houses in the    
 village, when he was young.           
 The school had the school bells on the
 school wall and when the bell rang    
 they had to line up in the playground.
 When he was young he said only 900    
 people lived there and there were only
 a few houses.                         
 They had horses and carts on the road 
 and only a few of them so games like  
 marbles could be played.
