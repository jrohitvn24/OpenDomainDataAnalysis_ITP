		<content> Many people move outside the area for 
 recreational facilities. There are    
 very good sports centres at nearby    
 Calne and Swindon, the latter boasting
 the popular Oasis swimming pool with a
 diving tank and a wave machine. There 
 is a new swimming pool at Marlborough 
 where most of the weekly shopping is  
 done. Most people travel to these     
 centres by car although the local bus 
 service is good. Swindon boasts a very
 good and popular theatre which is     
 attended by some of the local children
 who perform in some of the            
 productions. The two local public     
 houses are not generally well         
 frequented by the loal inhabitants.
