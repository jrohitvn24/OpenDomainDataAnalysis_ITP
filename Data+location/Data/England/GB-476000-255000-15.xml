		<title>15Leisure Activities, Wootton.</title>
		<content>   We looked through the questionnaire 
we had sent out and found that         
swimming was the most popular sport    
followed by walking. Sewing was the    
most popular craft activity.           
   Quite a few people liked horse      
riding and showing ponies and only     
three out of about sixty families      
mentioned no leisure activities at     
all.                                   
   We were surprised at the large      
number of people who take part in      
active sports.                         
   In the future we would like to see  
more leisure centres for children and  
their families as the existing ones    
are too far away especially for people 
who cannot afford to run a car.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
