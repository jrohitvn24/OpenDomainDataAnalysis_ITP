		<content>Blakesley Reading Room is a building   
with a long history.It has since been  
used as a meeting room, a bank, a flat,
and, last but not least, a doctor's    
surgry. The trustees of the reading    
room, decided it was time to renovate  
the building and, in particular, to    
make a little side room into a doctor's
consulting room, redecorated and       
provided with washing facilities. This 
they have now done at a cost of little 
over 1000 pounds and paid for it       
entirely by voluntary donations from   
people in the village as no grants were
forthcoming from the Department of     
Health, or any other source. While     
patients have to go to Towcester       
Medical Centre if they have to be      
examined, they have a consulting       
facility on their doorstep. The surgery
is used by two practices (5 doctors in 
all).                                  </content>
