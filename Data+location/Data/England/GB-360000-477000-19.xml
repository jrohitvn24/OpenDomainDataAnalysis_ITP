		<title>19TOURISM IN KIRKBY LONSDALE</title>
		<content> Tourism has increased rapidly in the  
 Kirkby Lonsdale area in the last 15-20
 years.This is largly attributed to    
 the fact that people have more{leisure
{time}but also because of increased    
 mobility, as the majority who visit   
 the area do so in their own           
 cars.Interestingly, steep rise in     
{petrol prices}in the 1970s may have   
 encouraged tourism as more people     
 started visiting places nearer their  
 own homes.The most popular places     
 visited are{Devils Bridge, St. Mary's 
{Church}and{Ruskin's View.}The only    
 major problem created by tourism is   
{parking}and no real solution seems    
 possible.Some residents feel that if  
 tourism is going to be developed, then
 more{leisure facilities}must be       
 created to encourage them to come and 
 stay.Increased publicity may be       
 needed to stimulate tourism even more.</content>
