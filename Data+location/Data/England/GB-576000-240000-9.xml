		<content>   There are several reasons for the   
 increased yield of farm crops:-       
  1. Plant breeders have developed     
{better plants.                        
  2. The new plants are{more resistant 
 to disease.                           
  3. More and better{machinery}has been
 developed to do the work.             
  4.{Artificial fertilizers}will       
 produce more growth.                  
  5.{Chemical sprays}kill insects,     
 prevent disease, regulate stalk growth
 and kill weeds.                       
                                       
  In addition to the main crops of     
 wheat and barley there are a few      
 fields of other crops. Oil-seed rape, 
 which is bright yellow at the end of  
 May. Beans and oats are grown for     
 animal feed and a clover mixture for  
 hay. Some farmers grow a field of     
 canary grass to attract pheasants.    </content>
