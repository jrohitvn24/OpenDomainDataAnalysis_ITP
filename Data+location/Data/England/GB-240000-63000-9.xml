		<content> This voluntary{club}is concerned with 
 the conservation and{ecology}of the   
 Tamar Valley, mainly along the tidal  
 reaches below Gunnislake. This        
 proposed area of outstanding natural  
 beauty has great scenic value and     
 important wildlife habitats.          
 The TPS was founded in 1967 to fight  
 off a coal-fired power station at     
 Insworke Point. Since this successful 
 opposition the main{social concern}of 
 the TPS is preventing undesirable and 
 sporadic development and exploitation 
 of this beautiful area. It makes      
 representation to planning authorities
 and has been involved in public       
 enquiries. It also seeks to educate   
 public{attitude}to the environment's  
 contribution to the quality of life.  
 Recent concerns include mining        
 proposals, listed buildings,footpaths,
 tree-felling licences, and marinas.   </content>
