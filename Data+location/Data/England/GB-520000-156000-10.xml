		<content> ... "We asked a few policemen where   
 they had come from;they came from     
 Buckingham Palace,Fulham,Banstead and 
 Hounslow.                             
 We asked them some questions. They    
 told us that there were 800 policemen 
 and women,half-a-million people,40,000
 cars and coaches,26 ambulances,1 fire 
 engine,24 helicopters,10 police dogs, 
 150 traffic wardens,20-30 police cars 
 and 60 police bikes. People were      
 arriving five hours before the race." 
                                       
 ... "I stood by the new fence. Trash  
 on the ground everywhere. Traffic     
 gives off the smell of fumes and the  
 engines roar loudly. Underneath me are
 piles of wet,squelchy mud and bits of 
 horse manure. I can see T.V. cameras  
 getting ready to film the race from   
 high scaffolding. First-aid tents     
 dotted around,and mounted police."    </content>
