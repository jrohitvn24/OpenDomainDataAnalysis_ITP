		<content> Farming is the principal industry of  
 this rural area.  Most of the land is 
 tenanted.  One unit of about 800 acres
 is owned by a large farming company   
 which is itself a subsidiary of a     
 national Insurance group.  One        
 small-holding of about 35 acres is in 
 private ownership but it is becoming  
 increasingly difficult to be          
 self-supporting on such small acreage.
 This is a prime sugar-beet growing    
 area with the processing factory 22   
 miles distant at Kings Lynn.  The     
 climate is conducive to the production
 of good malting barley.  Wheat oats   
 and oilseed rape are also grown, and  
 some ryegrass for seed production.    
 Carrots and potatoes provide useful   
 break-crops.  One labour intensive    
 farm grows Brussels Sprouts and has 70
 acres of apple orchards.  The farmers 
 are sympathetic about conservation.   </content>
