		<content> Thurnscoe dates way back into{Roman   
 times when it was originally called   
{Ternusc.}We have evidence that        
 Thurnscoe was a Roman village because 
 there is a{Roman Road}running from    
 Southfield Lane all the way to        
 Clayton.                              
 The first actual written record of    
 Thurnscoe was in the{Domesday Book -  
{1087.}Thurnscoe and Deighton were two 
 seperate villages. But today there is 
 only Deighton Street.                 
 Thurnscoe was an agricultural village 
 and in{1851}there was approximately   
{200}people in Thurnscoe.              
 In{1890 HIckleton Main Colliery}was   
 opened and in the next year{1,000     
 people came to Thurnscoe. With more   
 people Thurnscoe became dirty and many
 diseases spread, such as typhus and   
 diphtheria. In 1930 houses were built 
 especially for the Hickleton Colliery.</content>
