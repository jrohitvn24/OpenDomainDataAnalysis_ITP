		<content> St.Michael's Church is the old Parish 
 Church.It is now redundant but has    
 been renovated and preserved by local 
 enthusiasts.                          
   The church is on a hill about 2     
 miles away from the present village.  
   The church is about 900 years old.  
 There is a Saxon Cross on the porch of
 the church. The church is quite small 
 inside,there are 9 rows of pews on    
 each side,the choir pews and the      
 altar.There is a small bell tower     
 holding an ancient bell. There are    
 narrow stained glass windows.         
   The church stands in an old         
 graveyard and a modern graveyard      
 adjoins the site.                     
   The church and graveyard are very   
 attractive and well worth a visit.
