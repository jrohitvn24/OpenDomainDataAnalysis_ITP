		<title>11My Weekend</title>
		<content> Last Sunday I was making a swing with 
 my friend and I jumped off the swing  
 to hide when my sister came on her    
 bike. Accidently I tripped over a tree
 stump and landed on some glass cutting
 my hand. There was blood all over my  
 hand so my friend said, "Go to your   
 mum" and she said, "You'll need       
 stitches".                            
 We went to the Accident Unit in       
 Chester hospital and we waited half an
 hour. The doctor said, "We'll put some
 stitches in it". I asked him if it    
 would hurt and he said, "Sheer agony".
 When he had put an injection in to    
 numb my hand, he started to put the   
 stitches in and after 40 minutes we   
 came home. He had put four stitches in
 my cut. When I got home I got 50p for 
 each stitch so my dad gave me Â£2.00.
