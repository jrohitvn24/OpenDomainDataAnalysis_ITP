		<title>11CHANGES IN WITHAM IN 20TH C.</title>
		<content>{SINCE 1966 }                          
 In 1966 began the Town Development    
 Scheme,with some of the money coming  
 from the GLC. New Factories, offices, 
 and shops, community centres and the  
 Sports Centre were built as well as   
 the houses. The first houses in this  
 scheme were on the Templars Estate and
 the next were on Forest Road.         
 A comment from two elderly ladies     
 brought up in Witham:-"We're lucky    
 really,we've got the Co-op up here and
 the Post Office..I saw a friend of    
 mine up here the other day - when they
 were building it there ,she was       
 awfully upset and she said how useful 
 it was.And I said 'Yes ,we grumbled   
 about the buildings, and then as you  
 get older you find they're useful.'." 
  Most families had moved here from    
 London but most of the Junior children
 have lived here from their birth.     </content>
