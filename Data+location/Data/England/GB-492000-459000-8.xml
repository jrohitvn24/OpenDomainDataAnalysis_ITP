		<content>      Every day of the week mobile vans
 come to the village.Many of the old   
 age pensioners depend on the vans for 
 their shopping.The{milkman}comes every
 day during the morning.The{bread van, 
{Ray's Rambler,}goes round the village 
 three times a week.The{fruit and      
{vegetable}van visits on a Saturday    
 during the afternoon.The{butcher's van
 comes twice a week on a Thursday and  
 Saturday.{Woodheads,who sell a bit of 
{everything,}come twice a week,Tuesday 
 and Thursday.                         
                                       
      I only buy sweets occasionally   
 from the Rambler van.But people who do
 not have a car have to buy most of    
 their food regularly from the mobile  
 vans.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
