     A lot of the children in Onecote  
also like to roller-skate.  Each person
takes a pair of roller-skates along to 
the old school playground which they   
use as a roller-skating rink for doing 
stunts and just having good fun.  A    
cassette player is usually taken along 
too and the children dance to the      
music.                                 
                                       
     Dinghy races are held on the      
River Hamps but the competitors go     
along just for fun.                    
                                       
     People also swim in the river.    
                                       
     Shooting is quite a regular       
activity, especially among the         
farmers. Most weekends they will phone 
each other up to arrange the place and 
time.                                  </content>
