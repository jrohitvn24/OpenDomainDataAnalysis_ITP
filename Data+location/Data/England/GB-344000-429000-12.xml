Most farm houses are upwards of 100    
years old. All bungalows are post-1919,
most are post-1945.Many are dormers,   
some have had dormers added. These are 
found as detached or semis.2-storey    
houses are either detached, semis or   
terraces and are of all ages.          
PRIVATELY OWNED                        
Including farms, about 80% of the      
houses fall into this category. Several
are under construction as this survey  
is being pepared. There are no Building
Societies, etc. in the block, but there
are several in nearby Kirkham.         
COUNCIL PROPERTY                       
20% of the houses were put up by the   
council, but since their erection,     
several have been bought by the        
occupant.Practically all council houses
are post-1945 and over 90% are         
terraced.                              </content>
