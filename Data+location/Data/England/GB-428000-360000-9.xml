		<content> I go to school in Matlock.There are{  
{160}boys and girls in my school aged  
 between{7}and{11.}There are five other
 schools in Matlock.Two of them have   
 some pupils who board at the school.  
 While I am at school I learn to read, 
 write, do mathematics, draw, paint,   
 dacce and skip, play games and        
 generally find out about things.We    
 have 3 playtimes each day.I like      
 playtimes except when it rains.We can 
 buy crisps during the morning playtime
 .They cost 13p.                       
 We have our dinner in the canteen and 
 my favourite is fish-fingers and chips
 with cream eclairs for pudding.       
 We often go out on a bus for a visit  
 and we also go to other schools to    
 play football, netball and cricket.   
 I am friends with most people and the 
 teachers are kind.They don't shout at 
 us much at all.I hope to be a teacher.</content>
