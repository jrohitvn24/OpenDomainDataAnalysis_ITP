		<title>06 CHURCHES IN FOLKESTONE</title>
		<content>   There are twenty-one churches in    
Folkestone. Half have been built in    
this century and only eight churches   
appear to be more than two hundred     
years old. There are ten {Anglican}    
churches, three {Catholic} and three   
{Baptist},two {Methodist},and one each 
of {United Reformed},{Evangelical} and 
{Christian Science}. They offer a total
of 92 services per week, the Catholic  
churches providing 31. The most        
interesting church is St. Eanswythes   
which was founded in 1138 and is       
dedicated to a local girl, a           
granddaughter of King Ethelbert, who   
developed the first convent in England 
in 630. It is very beautiful in        
architecture and decoration and has a  
stained glass window in memory of      
William Harvey. There are also two     
Garrison churches and one Mariners'    
church which overlooks the harbour.    </content>
