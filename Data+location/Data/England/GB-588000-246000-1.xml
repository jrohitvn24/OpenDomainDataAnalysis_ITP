		<content>The block lies mainly in the Parish    
of Acton with parts of the parishes of 
Lavenham Gt Waldingfield and Long      
Melford to the N.east S.east and N.west
respectively. This is a predominantly  
agricultural area with scattered dwell-
ings, mainly farmhouses.  In the N.E.  
lie the outskirts of Lavenham. The     
terrain is a low plateau with a max.   
height of 86m to the east sloping grad-
ually to 40m in the s.west.  Drainage  
is towards the Chad Brook which runs   
southward in the west of the block. The
block is traversed north-south by a B  
road. Two minor roads cross from SW to 
NE to join the B road. Another minor   
road comes from the west to join the B 
road in Lavenham village. In general,  
the climate follows the East Anglian   
pattern but there are some interesting 
local variations.
