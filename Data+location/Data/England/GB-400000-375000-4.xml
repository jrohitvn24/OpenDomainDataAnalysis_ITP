		<content>   The first to be constructed was the 
 Fernilee, at the northern lower end of
 the valley. It was built in 1938 by   
 the Stockport Corporation Water       
 Undertaking, under an Act of          
 Parliament which also authorised a    
 second reservoir(i.e. Erwood).        
   It is the larger of the two, with a 
 capacity of 1,087 million gallons, and
 cost Â£480,000 to build                
   In 1964,planning approval was given 
 for the second reservoir, Errwood to  
 be built just upstream from           
 Fernilee.Three and a half years and   
 One and a half million pounds later,  
 it was complete and filled to its     
 capacity of 927 million gallons. .
