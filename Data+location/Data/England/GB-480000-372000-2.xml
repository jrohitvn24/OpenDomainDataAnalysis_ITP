		<title>02Housing - Newton/Dunham area</title>
		<content>  Housing standards are generally high.
 Flats and one bedroomed bungalows have
 been built for rent by the Council for
 the elderly.  These have replaced     
 substandard cottages.  Some think the 
 style of these new dwellings is not in
 tune with the environment externally  
 but attractive internally.  A number  
 of new detached and semi-detached     
 houses are being built for the home   
 buyer.There is a tendency to renovate 
 old property with the help of grants  
 from the council.  Renting houses from
 private landlords is becoming less    
 popular. As the houses become empty   
 landlords sell.  House prices are     
 stable.  A three bed semidetached     
 house is priced around Â£25,OOO.       
 Heating is by oil or solid fuel.      
 Lighting and power is by electricity. 
 There is no gas in the area.  All     
 houses have gardens.                  </content>
