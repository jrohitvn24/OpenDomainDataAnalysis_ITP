		<content> Ten families of Romanies have bought a
 field adjoining the M6 motorway and   
 are hoping for planning permission to 
 use it as a permanent site. The family
 group have installed electricity and  
 toilet facilities for use by the whole
 site. They have covered the site with 
 hard core, but have also fenced off a 
 grassy area as a playing field for the
 children. They are meeting stern      
 opposition and find in twentieth      
 century society a bit of predjudice   
 and antagonism. They want a permanent 
 site so that the children can have an 
 education. The families have also     
 faced increasing difficulties in      
 finding sites when travelling, which  
 is another reason for trying to       
 establish a permanent site.
