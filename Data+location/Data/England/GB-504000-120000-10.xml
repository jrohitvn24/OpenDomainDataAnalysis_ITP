		<title>10INDUSTRY NORTH OF PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  There is at present no industrial    
 area in our block. The site of a      
 former brickworks at the junction of  
 the A29 and Broomers Hill Lane has now
 been levelled. Against local          
 opposition the site is scheduled for  
 "small industrial units". A notice    
 advertising this availability has been
 displayed for some years but no unit  
 has yet been erected.                 
  A former industry was iron working.  
 On Pallingham Manor Farm is a cottage 
 called "Furnacepond Cottage" Near here
 was a hammer pond which fed a hammer  
 mill. Now only the earth platform for 
 feeding iron ore and charcoal into the
 furnace remains as a raised plateau in
 a field. Remains of iron slag are     
 found in this field and an adjacent   
 stream. Records show that the mill was
 working in 1664 but all trace had     
 disappeared by 1720.                  </content>
