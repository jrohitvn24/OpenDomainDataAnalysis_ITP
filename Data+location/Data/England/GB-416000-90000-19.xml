		<title>19Land Reclamation</title>
		<content> In the mid 1950s Ashtree Farm enjoyed 
 rough grazing from Purewell to the    
 harbour foreshore.Salt marshes fed by 
 3 streams flowing under the Purewell  
 shingle bank stretched from the       
 eastern branch of the Avon to the     
 creek along Stanpit,north of Tutton's 
 Well,where fishermen cleaned and dried
 their nets.Westwards from the 'Ship in
 Distress'to the Avon a band of 200-300
 metres of land has since been         
 reclaimed by the depositing of refuse,
 its consolidation and surfacing with  
 topsoil.This has enabled the          
 development of a landscaped golf      
 course,playing fields,the indoor      
 sports centre and the swimming pool   
 with parking facilities.Natural       
 silting along Stanpit and Mudeford    
 waterfronts has enabled foreshore     
 property owners to reclaim areas of   
 marshland for garden use.             </content>
