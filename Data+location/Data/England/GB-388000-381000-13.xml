		<title>13A day in my life</title>
		<content> I can't go straight home from school  
 because my mum and dad are still at   
 work.Therefore I go to the house which
 I go to before school.My mum gets home
 from work around 4 o clock.When I see 
 her pass I go home too.When I get home
 I usually go upstairs and play with my
 computer if I haven't got any         
 homework.Before I know it my mum is   
 calling me for tea.I go downstairs and
 have tea with my mum and brother as   
 my dad does not get in until much     
 later.After tea my brother and I go   
 into the lounge and have a game of    
 snooker whilst my mum talks to my dad 
 in the kitchen.At 8 o clock I go      
 upstairs and have a bath and clean my 
 teeth.Then I get into bed and read for
 a while.I soon drop off to sleep and  
 when I awake it is 6.50a.m. and I am  
 ready to start again.
