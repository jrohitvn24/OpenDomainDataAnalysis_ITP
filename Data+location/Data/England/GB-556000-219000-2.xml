		<content> As the area was originally forest, it 
 is not surprising to find that wood   
 has played a large part in the        
 construction of the local houses.     
 Most of the houses built before 1930  
 are timber frame with lathe and       
 plaster walls.  Roofing is either     
 pantiles or thatch with a brick       
 chimney either built centrally or on  
 one end wall.  The advent of the      
 railway enabled stone and brick to be 
 used more widely in the area and since
 the 1930's with much easier transport,
 brick has taken over as the dominant  
 material used in house construction   
 although we have seen wood making a   
 comeback in recent times.             
{It is interesting to note that the    
{local churches contain some Roman     
{stone which has been recovered from   
{the old Roman Stane Street which      
{originally ran nearby.                </content>
