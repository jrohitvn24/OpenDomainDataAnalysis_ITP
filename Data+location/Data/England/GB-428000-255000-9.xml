		<title>09A view of Ashorne.</title>
		<content> Ashorne is no more than 300 years old.
 It is beleived to have been formed    
 when the people of Newbold Pacey      
 crossed the Woozeley Brook to escape  
 the Plague of 1665.                   
 It is a happy,thriving village with a 
 strong community spirit."There is some
 kind of activity nearly every night of
 the week especially in the summer with
 cricket matches the W.I.(Women's      
 Institute) and the like."             
 Apart from the recently completed     
 village hall, built by the villagers  
 there is only one public building the 
 Pub.. In 1975 when the village school 
 was closed there was stronge          
 opposition as the villagers felt that 
 the school kept young families in the 
 village. The children attend Moreton  
 Morrell School and their parents are  
 some of the strongest supporters of   
 the school.                           </content>
