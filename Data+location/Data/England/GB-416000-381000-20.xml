		<title>20THE COMMUNITY TUTOR</title>
		<content> The origin of the position of         
 Community Tutor based within a        
 secondary school, lies in the belief  
 that the institution operates as a    
{Community Resource}in the widest sense
 of the term. The school is a natural  
 focal point within any geographical   
 area, and also contains plant,        
 equipment, facilities and staff       
 expertise which should be available   
 for use by{all}within its catchment   
 area both during{and}outside the usual
 school day.  The job of the Community 
 Tutor is to facilitate this link      
 between the school and its community  
 both on and off site. Any school      
 clearly has a role in encouraging and 
 supporting independent initiatives,   
 such as youth clubs or women's groups 
 and the Tutor must work in both a     
 formal and informal manner with a wide
 range of individuals and groups.      </content>
