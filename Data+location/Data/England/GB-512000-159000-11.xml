		<title>11CROWN COMMISSION IN OXSHOTT</title>
		<content> Large areas of land are still owned by
 the Crown Commissioners, particularly 
 in squares 3,4,7 &amp; 8. Here the houses 
 are much bigger and many very 'posh': 
 some ultra-modern, all glass or blank 
 walls; some imitation Spanish villas, 
 some 20th century Georgian, built of  
 brick with pillars at the front door, 
 sash windows and fan lights, but      
 without the height and delicate       
 workmanship of the 18th century;      
 some 'mock Tudor' houses with wooden  
 beams, weather boarding or hanging    
 tiles.                                
 Square 7 contains Oxshott High Street 
 and so all houses are packed closer   
 together. The few shops were built in 
 the 1930's, some 3 stories high and   
 the petrol station was rebuilt in the 
 1970's.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
