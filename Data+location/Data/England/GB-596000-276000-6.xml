families occupying them, 3 rented from 
the County Council. All are worked by  
the families occupying them and only   
one employs permanent help.Some land   
is farmed by people who live in nearby 
areas. The main crops are wheat,barley,
oats sugarbeet &amp; grass. The beet is    
processed at the regional sugar factory
in Bury St Edmunds;the grass is for hay
silage or pasture. Two farms have dairy
herds whose milk is sold to the Milk   
Marketing Board - one has Friesian     
and one has Jersey cattle.Some Jersey  
milk is sold locally. One farm produces
vegetables,eggs &amp; poultry which are    
sold in its farm shop, together with   
vegetables &amp; fruit from wholesale
