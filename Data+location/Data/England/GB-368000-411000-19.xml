		<title>19LOCAL PEOPLES CONCERNS</title>
		<content> The main social concerns for the      
 people of Johnson Fold are those      
 relevant to employment,local services 
 and amenities.There is a high rate of 
 unemployment on the estate but the    
 level of youth employment and the     
 prospects  of future employment cause 
 most anxiety.Also the fact that many  
 people on the estate have low income  
 occupations is highlighted by the high
 level of people receiving some kind   
 of welfare benefit.Many people also   
 would prefer much better recreation   
 facilities such as a sports centre or 
 a community centre.(At the present    
 moment there is a project to build an 
 Astroturf surface on the site of      
 Johnson Fold school).Many people feel 
 that the shopping facilities are poor 
 and that there's a need for a         
 supermarket and a chemist.            
                                       </content>
