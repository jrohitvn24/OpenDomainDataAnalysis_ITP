		<title>15A DAY AT MALSIS SCHOOL:2</title>
		<content> On Wednesdays and Sundays we can have 
 an allowance of sweets from the school
 sweetshop.                            
 We then have two afternoon lessons    
 which are followed by a games period  
 with rugby,cricket,athletics or       
 swimming,depending on the season.     
 Sometimes there are school matches    
 which are played at Malsis or at an   
 opposing school.                      
 After games we have tea,followed by   
 prep.in which we do work for an hour  
 without help from the teachers.       
 After prep. there is a free period    
 which is long or short according to   
 one's bed-time.In this time boys can  
 work or attend extra classes,rehearse 
 for a play,play snooker or table      
 tennis in the games room,or perhaps   
 just play outside on the fields which 
 are our school grounds.
