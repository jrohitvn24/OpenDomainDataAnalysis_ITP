 of{Rayne}and part of the towns of {   
{Braintree and Bocking.}               
   Braintree is 12 miles north east of 
 Chelmsford and 16 miles west of       
 Colchester. Its town centre used to be
 at the crossroad of two major roads,  
 one the Chelmsford to Halstead road   
 and the second being the Colchester to
 Bishop's Stortford road, although this
 fact is obscured by the modern road   
 network going around the town.        
   The population of Braintree, Bocking
 and Rayne is roughly thirty thousand. 
   Farming is one of the popular       
 industries in this block with many    
 hectares of barley,wheat,potatoes and 
 oats under crops.                     
   Market day is Wednesday and early   
 closing is Thursday.
