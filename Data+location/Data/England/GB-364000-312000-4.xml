		<content> Across the NW corner of the map a     
 minor road leading to Horton.To the   
 south is a new road,the Leegomery     
 by_pass which goes from Horton to     
 Shawbirch.                            
 There is a{mill}nearby and it is      
 disused.Some parts of the mill are    
 old.On top of the mill it is like a   
 castle with ramparts.That is why the  
 area is known as Hadley Castle.It has 
 been cared for by{G.K.N.Sankey Ltd}who
 have repaired it and re_roofed it.The 
 mill continued to work as a watermill 
 until the early 20th century.         
 Near to the mill is a dairy farm with 
 a large herd of Friesian cows.        
 Leading from the farm is a path which 
 goes to the disused Shropshire Union  
 Canal(Trench Bbranch).There are three 
 locks on this section of the          
 canal,Turnip Lock,Peaty Lock and      
 Hadley Lock.                          </content>
