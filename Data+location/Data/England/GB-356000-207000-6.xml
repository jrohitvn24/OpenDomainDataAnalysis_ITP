 MRS.QUEENIE HOOPER HAS BEEN TEACHING  
 MUSIC IN THIS AREA FOR 54 YEARS,AND AT
 THE AGE OF 74 IS STILL GOING STRONG.  
 SHE WAS BORN IN LITTLE DRYBROOK,AND   
 HAS LIVED ROUND AND ABOUT THE AREA ALL
 HER LIFE.THE"FOREST"WAS FULL OF SMALL 
 MINES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD,AND HER    
 FATHER WAS A MINER.HE WORKED ABOUT TWO
 MILES AWAY FROM HER HOME,AND SOMETIMES
 WHEN HEGOT TO WORK HE WAS TOLD        
 THERE WAS NO WORK AND THEY WOULD ALL  
 BE SENT BACK HOME,WITH NO             
 PAY.FACTORIES HAVE BOUGHT WELL PAID   
 JOBS AND MUCH BETTER CONDITIONS,AND   
 SOME THING THAT HER FATHER NEVER HAD  
 "PAID HOILIDAYS"MUSIC HAS BEEN HER    
 LIFE SINCE SHE WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND IF
 WERE TO ASK ANY ONE IN THE VILLAGES   
 WHO TAUGHT THEM MUSIC THE ANSWER WOULD
 PROBABLY BE MRS.HOOPER.
