		<content>    With one exception the whole area  
 is down to agricultural use under the 
 ownership of four very large farms.   
 The crops are mainly cereal and root  
 with a few sheep grazing the river    
 banks.  The exception is the large    
 scrapyard/foundry and haulage business
 run by two brothers on ajoining land. 
    Two roads cross the area from west 
 to east, the main A151 from Bourne to 
 Spalding and a small country lane from
 Bourne to Tongue End and on,eventually
 to either Spalding via Pode Hole or   
 Baston.  There is no direct vehicular 
 link between Tongue End and Twenty.   
 Remains may also be found of the rail-
 way trackbed, the line having been    
 closed in the nineteen-sixties.       
    The inhabitants are mostly employed
 on the local farms with only a few    
 travelling to either of the neighbour-
 ing towns or the local scrapyard.     </content>
