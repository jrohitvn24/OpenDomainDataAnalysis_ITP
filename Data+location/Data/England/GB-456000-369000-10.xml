		<title>10The 1984 Pit Strike</title>
		<content> Being in the North Nottinghamshire    
 Area of the N.C.B.,Welbeck Colliery   
 was not fully closed down by the 1984 
 -1985 Miners Strike.Initially about   
 1/3 of the workforce joined the strike
 but unrest about the right to hold a  
 national ballot and about the likely  
 length of strike action because of    
 existing coal stocks led to Notts pits
 such as Welbeck opting out of the     
 strike action .About 1/15 of the men  
 continued the strike and this led to  
 bitterness within the community and at
 the pit gate where local and "flying" 
 pickets gathered.  Extra police from  
 all over the country were billeted on 
 the Welbeck Estate .Unknown cars were 
 stopped for questioning at strategic  
 junctions on routes to pits such as   
 the Cuckney crossroads.Once violence  
 occurred in the streets of Cuckney but
 this was exaggerated by the media.    </content>
