		<title>04 Farming Around Newmillerdam</title>
		<content>    There is a lot of farm land in our 
 area the majority of which is growing 
 barley and wheat.The advantage for the
 farmers in this area is that the land 
 is very flat.                         
    When we were doing our survey the  
 most noticeable crop on the land was  
 rape seed.  The fields growing this   
 crop were a beautiful bright yellow   
 and as the wheat and barley were not  
 yet ripe it made the land look like a 
 patchwork of yellow and green.        
   Rape seed is used for manufactur-   
 ing vegetable oils and soap.  Some of 
 the farmers have changed to growing   
 rape seed because they can get more   
 money for it than other crops.        
   There is some dairy farming carried 
 on but not on a big scale because the 
 local farmers find it difficult to    
 compete with the big dairies.
