		<title>16Traditional Craft,Warbleton</title>
		<content> In this era of mass production it is  
 gratifying to find a traditional      
 craftsman in our midst.  David Bysouth
 follows his father and grandfather as 
 a wheelwright. Wheels are made using  
 seasoned elmwood for the hub, oak     
 for the spokes and curved ash or      
 possibly elm "felloes" for the rim.   
 In blacksmith fashion a red hot iron  
 tyre is hammered onto the rim and a   
 cast iron sleeve to the hub. Recent   
 years have seen an increased demand   
 for the wheelwright's skills. Whilst  
 some work involves repairing old      
 wheels,a growing interest in driving  
 horse-drawn vehicles both for         
 competitive sport and leisure, has    
 meant a demand for new wagons and     
 carts. In addition there is an        
 increased desire to restore derelict  
 carriages and vehicles.
