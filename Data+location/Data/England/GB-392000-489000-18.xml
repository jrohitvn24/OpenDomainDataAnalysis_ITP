		<content>{Postal}deliveries operate through the 
 Post Office in Askrigg. The Head Post 
 Office is in Darlington and this area 
 is DL8.                               
{Water}is obtained locally, although   
 during severe droughts, it has to be  
 transported into the area from further
 down the Dale by tanker.              
{Electricity}supplies come from the    
 National Grid, but power for one      
 joinery and lighting for Low Mill is  
 derived from the River Bain.          
 There is a{Police}House in Breconbar. 
 The{ambulance}station in Bainbridge is
 controlled from Harrogate, through    
 which even local emergency calls must 
 be channelled. This is a vital service
 as the area is twenty miles from the  
 nearest hospital.                     
{Bus services}are few and diminishing. 
 There is some local pressure for the  
 establishment of a Post-Bus service.  </content>
