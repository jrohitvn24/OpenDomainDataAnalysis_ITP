		<title>15Sunderland Point.</title>
		<content> Sunderland Point is a hamlet perched  
 on the Southern extremity of the      
 peninsula separating the Lune estuary 
 from Morecambe Bay.                   
 At high tide, the land forms a narrow 
 finger almost surrounded by water; the
 name itself is believed to refer to   
 the tenuous link with the mainland.   
 The land is grassland divided into    
 fields by cob (earth) banks and       
 hedges, with several small pits of    
 water.  Tidal marshland and stony     
 beaches fringe the land.  A few trees 
 grow close to the houses which perch  
 on a shingle ridge on the estuary side
 of the peninsular.                    
 The houses are mainly of stone,       
 purpose built or converted from       
 warehouses; many are 200 to 300 years 
 old.
