		<title>13FARMING IN TYDD ST.GILES</title>
		<content>       The main job in Tydd St.Giles is
 farm work, because there is a lot of  
 farmland.Most farmers who work for    
 themselves,and have a small farm,have 
 about 60 acres.There is more farmland 
 round the outskirts of our village    
 than there is in the village. Most    
 farmers have workers,but not all of   
 them do.                              
       Most farmers drill winter wheat 
 in early October. The farmers drill   
 winter barley in September and        
 drill spring barley in March and      
 April.                                
       Some farmers grow strawberries  
 and they are picked in late June and  
 July.Everyone in the village is busy  
 then.                                 
      Hardly any farmers have orchards 
 nowadays.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
