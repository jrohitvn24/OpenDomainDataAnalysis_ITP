		<title>14RECREATION IN LINTON</title>
		<content>  Most people think that the facilities
 in Linton are reasonable except for   
 the younger generations.People's      
 favourite activity that they do in    
 their spare time is reading.This was  
 so for 7 people out of the 11         
 interviewed.Gardening and Music came  
 second.They were the favourites of 5  
 people.The average amount of          
 television watched in a week is 10    
 hours.Half of the people we asked went
 to clubs which are different.Everyone 
 reads a newspaper especially the free 
 local ones.The article that most      
 people look for is sport.On the whole 
 people spend their spare time wisely. 
 They do things like cooking,walking,  
 sport,computing and many others too.  
 Surprisingly T.V.was put down by very 
 few people as their favourite.
