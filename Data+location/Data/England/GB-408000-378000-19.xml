 where a Rose Queen is crowned in a    
 ceremony in the church.There are      
 stalls, sideshows, sports and other   
 events on the recreation ground as    
 well as pet shows. A local silver band
 usually attends.                      
  In recent years an annual fell race  
 and sheep roast have taken place  to  
 raise money towards the improvement of
 The Reading Room- a village hall used 
 for various social functions.         
  Meeting approx. twice in the winter  
 months the local fox hunt assembles in
 the pub yard.They hunt with fox hounds
 and riders on horseback and haven't   
 caught a fox for year. It is mainly a 
 social event.
