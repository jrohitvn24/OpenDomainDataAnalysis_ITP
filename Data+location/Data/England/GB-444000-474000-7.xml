		<title>07SESSAY - A LIVELY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> There have been 2 important ceremonies
 held at Sessay Village Hall in the    
 past year.                            
 Firstly, Sessay was adjudged the{     
{winning village}in the{Best-Kept      
{Village Competition}organised by the  
 Yorkshire Rural Community Council.  We
 were presented with a wrought-ironwork
 sign set on an oak post (to keep until
 next competition in 1987) and an oak  
 seat as a permanent commemoration.    
 After the ceremony villagers and      
 guests had a sumptious tea.  We are   
 all very proud to have won as there   
 are many other pretty villages nearby.
 There was more celebration for{Sessay}
{WI's 60th anniversary}when the        
 national President of the Federation  
 of WIs attended a party and then      
 planted a cherry tree on the site of  
 an old elm which had to be felled     
 because of Dutch Elm Disease.         </content>
