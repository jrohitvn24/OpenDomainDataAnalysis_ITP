		<title>07GOLF AND CRICKET</title>
		<content> A meeting on Dec.24th 1882 agreed that
 a golf club should be set up at       
 Cox Green,that it would have subs of  
 one guinea per annum,that all members 
 would have to be "men of distinction",
 that there would be a maximum of 80   
 members and that the Earl of Durham   
 would be club President.              
 The first competition on this scenic  
 course was won by F.K.de Maffos with  
 a score of 96. The club house was     
 destroyed by fire in 1956 and a new   
 one opened in 1958. The course record 
 is held by Duncan Wood's round of nett
 63 played in 1982.                    
 S.Hylton C.C.have teams in the        
 Durham Coast League. Money for        
 ground and playing equipment is       
 raised by the members. This year a    
 West Indian pro.,Andrew Glasgow,is    
 playing and coaching the juniors.
