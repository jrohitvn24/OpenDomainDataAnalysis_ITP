		<content> Features of the area are the Tudor    
 halls built either on an original     
 Angle{cruck hall}or{aula,}or as a     
 replacement when the living part of   
 the aula became uninhabitable and only
 fit for agricultural purposes. The    
 halls were built on old trackways     
 which crossed the area directly to    
 other cruck buildings.                
   {Barlow Woodseats Hall,}to the South
 East, stands high on a rise and has a 
 great cruck barn with 5 sets of crucks
 remaining .North West of this stands  
{Unthank Hall}alongside its ancient    
 Anglian aula which also has 5 sets    
 of great crucks remaining.

 building converted with 3 sets of     
 crucks still intact.A footpath leads
