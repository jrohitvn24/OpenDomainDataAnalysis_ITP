		<title>13Royal Leamington Spa, Cinema</title>
		<content> Leamington Spa is lucky enough to have
 one of the 15 largest cinemas in the  
 U.K. The Regal Cinema was built in    
 1931, was then reconstructed and      
 modernised in 1969 because it was     
 considered unsafe. In the auditorium  
 there are 904 seats divided into 2    
 sections, smoking in the middle and   
 non-smoking on the outside. The loud  
 speakers are behind the netted screen 
 which is curved so that everyone gets 
 a good view. The sound effect speakers
 are spread all around the auditorium. 
 With all the people coming to the     
 cinema and eating the sweets and ice  
 creams they have a full skip of       
 rubbish a day. There are approximatly 
 25 staff working at the cinema but not
 together. The cinema in Leamington Spa
 is a good, comfortable cinema. It has 
 good refreshment facilities, also the 
 films are amusing and interesting.    </content>
