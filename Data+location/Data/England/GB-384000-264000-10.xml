		<title>10LIFE IN SYTCHAMPTON</title>
		<content> Some of the{inhabitants}have not lived
 in Sytchampton for very long, but     
 others have.Most of the children go to
 Sytchapton{School.}They have to cross 
 the dual carriageway to get to it.The 
 other children  go to Stourport       
 School, Ombersley School,and Droitwich
 high. Some people do their shopping in
 Droitwich,others do it in other places
 like Kiddiminster,Stourport,Ombersley,
 and Worcester. Most of the people go  
 shopping in their car,but the rest    
 walk. The people work in places like  
 Birmingham. The village has a         
 community hall, they organise dances  
 for the younger generation and whist  
 drives for old aged pensioners. The   
 whist drive is on Friday nights only. 
 There are no pensioners' clubs in     
 Sytchampton, so they go to Ombersly   
 called the Sunshine Club. The Parish  
 Council meet in the hall once a month.</content>
