		<title>11International Folk Festival.</title>
		<content>  This year Sidmouth will hold its     
 31st. annual{International Folklore   
{Festival.}It is{Britain's biggest     
{festival of folksong, dance and music 
 and features many of the best artists 
 from home and abroad with over 300    
 events this year. Dance teams have    
 been invited from many countries,     
 including{the Seychelles, India,      
{Egypt and Yugoslavia.                 
  There are many things going on       
 throughout the day and plenty of      
 action during the evening ranging from
 singing and street theatre to dancing 
 and musicians of all types.           
  Perhaps one of the most spectacular  
 combined performances of the week is  
 when a torchlight procession comes    
 from each end of the bay and meets on 
 the seafront beach where the torches  
 are extinguished. This ends each      
 year's performance.                   </content>
