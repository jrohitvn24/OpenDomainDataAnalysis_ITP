		<content> We went to visit a typical farmworkers
 cottage.  It was at the end of a track
 in Langwood Fen, surrounded by arable 
 land. The hut was cramped and dark and
 bare and had been deserted since 1958.
 It was made of a brick base with      
 corrugated sides and roof.  Inside the
 walls were made of wood, painted in   
 dark brown at the bottom and a        
 slightly lighter brown at the top.    
 There are only two rooms plus a pantry
 and an out-house.  The main room has  
 only an iron cooking range.  The      
 people had no mains water supply so   
 they drank boiled water collected from
 the roof.  For washing they used river
 water.  A large family probably lived 
 here in considerable discomfort,      
 without any of the things which we    
 think today are necessary for life,   
 not even a lavatory!
