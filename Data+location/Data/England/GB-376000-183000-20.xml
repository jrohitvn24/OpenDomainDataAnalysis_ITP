		<title>20DOMESDAY PROJECT IN HORTON</title>
		<content>   This section of the Domesday survey 
 has been compiled,written and edited  
 by the ten pupils of the Junior class 
 of Horton School and their teacher.We 
 were all rather worried at first that 
 it might be too difficult for such a  
 small number of young children but now
 that we have finished we feel that it 
 was enjoyable and worth the effort    
 that was put into it.We particuarly   
 enjoyed the long walks, colouring     
 maps,studying nature and collecting   
 fossils,wild flowers and feathers.We  
 feel we have learned more about the   
 place where we live, improved our     
 writing and drawing and now understand
 maps and our computer much better.
