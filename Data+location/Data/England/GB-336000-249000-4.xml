{Dairy House Farm}                     
   The farm is about 150 acres and is  
 owned by{Mr.Lloyd.}It has a herd of 40
 cows and 20 calves.                   
   The machinery includes{three        
{tractors,silage trailers and          
{cutters,}milking parlour and a boiler.
   In summer the cattle graze in the   
 fields but in winter when the grass   
 stops growing they are fed on fodder  
 crops.The farm makes hay and silage   
 for fodder,straw is also used for     
 fodder.Most of the milk produced is   
 sold to the Milk Marketing Board or   
 used for dairy products such as       
 yoghurt and cheesecakes in "Pru's     
 Dairy".Pru Lloyd used to have a       
 workshop on the farm but now the      
 business has expanded and she rents a 
 purpose built factory in nearby       
 Weobley.                              </content>
