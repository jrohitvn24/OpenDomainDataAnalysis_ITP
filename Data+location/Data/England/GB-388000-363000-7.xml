		<title>07MACCLESFIELD CANAL</title>
		<content> Macclesfield canal was built to       
 connect Manchester to the Midlands and
 Potteries.It opened in 1831 and has   
 twelve locks in one mile. Flooding is 
 prevented in three different ways:- a)
 Simple overflow channel b) hand       
 operated sluice c) stop-planks fitted 
 into channels in the banks.The canal  
 once brought coal to the silk and     
 cotton mills from Adlington and       
 Poynton mines, stone from Kerridge,   
 hardware from Birmingham,Pottery from 
 the Potteries, lime from the high peak
 farmers and builders, beer from Burton
 to Inns on its banks and wine and     
 spirits from London. Nowadays the     
 canal is used for pleasure cruising   
 and one or two enthusiasts carry house
 - coal for local sale during the      
 winter months.One boat is owned by a  
 school for the handicapped and used   
 for educational purposes.             </content>
