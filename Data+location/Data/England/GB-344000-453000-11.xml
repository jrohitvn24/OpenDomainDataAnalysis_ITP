		<content> The area is agricultural,the greater  
part being the Manor of Thurnham,owned,
since 1556,by the Dalton family which  
rented its lands to tenant farmers.    
After World War II many tenants        
purchased their farms,concentrating on 
Friesian cattle with a few sheep. Grass
crops provide sileage.The area is      
clipped by a branch of the Lancaster   
canal leading into a basin now a       
marina:see account of adjoining area.  
The small population lives in separated
farming settlements with two small     
hamlets each of half a dozen dwellings.
Thurnham Hall,a seat of the            
Daltons,fell into disrepair during the 
20th century and was renovated in the  
1970's.The Daltons,Roman Catholic until
the end of the 19th century,supported  
the building,near to the Hall,of first 
a chapel and then a church,consecrated 
in 1848.                               </content>
