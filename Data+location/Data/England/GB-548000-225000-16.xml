		<title>16Manuden House</title>
		<content> There was no damage done in the wars  
 except a crack in the window and the  
 chimneys were cracked. I think        
 Manuden is a lovely place to live I   
 have been here for 57 years and I     
 moved in 1928. I don't know, but I    
 think it was built in Queen Annes time
 or before. The village has changed    
 with more houses being built and more 
 people have come. Before there were   
 only farms and a few cottages. The    
 people worked in shop, forge and      
 bakerey. I have got a dog,two donkeys,
 over the road are my daughters,I used 
 to have horses which we used for      
 hunting. No, I had no job but to look 
 after the family. I would not move    
 because I love the house too much. I  
 have no unique things but very lovely 
 things. I do not have many visitors   
 but when I get them I  enjoy it.
