		<title>15Four Oaks - Clubs</title>
		<content> Memberships of clubs,societies and    
 other organisations is still a major  
 feature of life for many people of all
 ages.Sporting clubs are the most      
 popular especially for young          
 adults,with golf club membership      
 being the top choice.An additional    
 attraction here is the social activity
 connected with such clubs.            
 Organisations aimed at young people   
 are numerous and very popular.The     
 scout and guide movements with their  
 branches for young children are       
 enthusiastically  supported.Church    
 choirs mostly struggle to maintain    
 viable numbers but the acceptancce of 
 girl choristers has saved some choirs 
 from disbandment.Youth clubs remain   
 popular,although their appeal to some 
 teenagers is not as strong as         
 hitherto.Clubs exist to cater for the 
 minor interests of local people.      </content>
