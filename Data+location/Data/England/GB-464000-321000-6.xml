		<content> We get up early and put on play       
 clothes like jeans and a sweater.We go
 and have a breakfast of bacon, eggs   
 and cereal.Some of us have jobs to do 
 like feeding rabbits,ducks or cows.   
 Sometimes we go to the ice skating at 
 Nottingham.You can spend 3 hours on   
 the ice.For lunch we have chips and   
 sausages.In the afternoon we sometimes
 watch television.We might call for a  
 friend and play on our bikes again.We 
 do wheelies and go scrambling.We play 
 football and cricket or go on the     
 swings.We have tea in front of the    
 television.The tea could be pork pie  
 and salad.We go to bed at 9.00pm. and 
 read ourselves to sleep.
