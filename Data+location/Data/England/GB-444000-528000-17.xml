		<content> One of the best places for watching   
 birds is from the back lane which runs
 from Brierton quarry to Dalton Piercy.
 The most common birds to be seen are  
 the crow, rook, blackbird, songthrush 
 and magpie. Slightly less common but  
 also seen are the skylark, partridge, 
 pheasant, blue tit and kestrel. The   
 kestrel is being seen more and more   
 frequently near the A19 where it finds
 easy carrion. Farmers recognise it as 
 an ally against mice, rats, voles and 
 harmful insects which destroy their   
 crops. Occasionally a sparrow hawk may
 be seen, and there are doves and      
 swallows near Brierton Farms.         
 Most interesting of all perhaps are   
 the owls. Several species of owl can  
 be seen but the most common is  the   
 barn owl.
