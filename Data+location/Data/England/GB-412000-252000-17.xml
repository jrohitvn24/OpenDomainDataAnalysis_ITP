		<title>17THE SEASONS IN GRAFTON</title>
		<content> Last Winter was very cold with snow   
 until March.All the roads were blocked
 and not cleared for a week and the    
 School meals were unable to get       
 through.Winter is the most common time
 for power shortages. Lambs are born   
 in Spring and seeds are planted.Floods
 often occur and sometimes roads are   
 blocked.The River Avon by the bridge  
 at Welford usually floods at least    
 once a year and the villagers have    
 difficulty in getting to work  In     
 Summer temperatures reach 30 degrees  
 celcius however the winds make it feel
 cool.Sometimes we have thunderstorms. 
 In Autumn we dig up potatoes and      
 harvest the corn with a combine       
 harvester.A machine separates the ears
 from the stalk and the stalk is made  
 into bales, then the stubble is       
 burned. This can cause damage to the  
 hedges.                               </content>
