		<content> Kerbs.                                
  A kerb is where a path meets the     
 road. It is best to play this game    
 where there is a deep(high) kerb. This
 is because it is easier to score some 
 points. You need a ball at the kerb   
 from the roadside. It is a good idea  
 to play in a quiet street.            
  If you throw the ball with one hand  
 and from below head height and it hits
 the kerb you score 10 points. If you  
 use both hands and from above the head
 you score 100 points, if it hits the  
 kerb. If you roll the ball at the kerb
 you can only score one point.         
  The game can be played with any size 
 of ball. There is no limit to the     
 number of people who can play. The    
 winner is the person with the highest 
 number of points.
