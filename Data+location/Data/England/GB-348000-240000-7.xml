		<title>07TRINITY SCHOOL SUMMER FETE</title>
		<content> There was a{horse}outside with 2 slip-
 pery rollers. Corinna stayed on for 1 
 minute &amp; got her money back. At Mum's 
 grocery{tombola}I paid 10p to have a  
 go. I got a mouse purse, put my money 
 in it, &amp; went to the{toy &amp; bookstall  
 but bought nothing. Back with Mum on  
 the tombola I won a plastic bracelet. 
 I listened to the{School Ceilidh band 
 getting ready to play. There was a lot
 of crashing &amp; banging.People were get-
 ting ready for the{Fancy Dress.}Some  
 little ones had all won lollies; red  
 outside, yellow in the middle. Next   
 door you had to{knock down tins}with  
 ping-pong balls but the balls were    
 light &amp; bounced everywhere. In anoth- 
 er game,{Hit the Rat,}you had to get  
 the rat in its tummy between 2 tunnels
 ...I bought plants for Dad &amp; Mum who  
 said, 'Let's go home!' so I went home 
 with all my prizes &amp; presents.        </content>
