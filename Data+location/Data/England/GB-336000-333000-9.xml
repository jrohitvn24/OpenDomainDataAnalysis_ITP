 but now it is used for lots of        
 different things like sports.Some of  
 these sports are,five a side football,
 badminton and table tennis.The market 
 hall itself is quite remarkable for   
 its time.There are stone pillars by   
 the main gate.The sports council are  
 hoping to put new lighting and toilets
 in the market hall.The window frames  
 are made of sandstone.The market hall 
 is open on Tuesday for the market and
