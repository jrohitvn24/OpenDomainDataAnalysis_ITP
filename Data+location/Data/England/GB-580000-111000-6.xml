		<content> At weekends we spend a lot of time{at 
{home,}sharing jobs around the house   
 and garden, tidying our bedrooms,     
 washing dishes, baking cakes and      
 looking after pets. We like to get up 
 late and have a cooked breakfast. We  
 sometimes have a barbecue in the      
 garden and nearly all of us have a    
 roast lunch on Sundays. When the      
 weather isn't fine we watch television
 a lot and enjoy indoor games and      
 puzzles together. Sometimes relations 
 and friends visit us. Many like       
 reading but television is more        
 popular.{If we go out}it is usually   
 for pleasure though many families go  
 shopping together. A car ride in the  
 country is very popular, sometimes    
 visiting friends and relations. Some  
 go to the beach or the park, visit    
 local places of interest and go for   
 country walks and picnics.            </content>
