		<title>10Clay Pipe Making, Crowedge</title>
		<content> The {Halifax Old Seam of clay}is taken
 from open cast mines up to 150 ft.    
 deep (the mine is back filled as the  
 clay is worked out and very quickly   
 reverts to good farmland). The seam is
 opprox. 15 ft. thick of which only the
 middle 5 ft. is pure enough for top   
 quality pipes. The seam varies in     
 chararter horizontally and clay from  
 several mines is blended to produce a 
 dense, vitrified and impervious body. 
 Clay is also brought from the Midlands
   The extruded clay pipes, varying in 
 size from 100mm diam. x 1500mm in     
 length to 1m diam. x 3m in length and 
 weighing up to two tons, are mainly   
 fired in tunnel kilns heated to a     
 final temperature of 1100 degrees C.  
 by{North Sea Gas.}There is an immense 
 stock of liquified gas for emergency  
 use.{The company employs about 1000   
{people}- a small number live locally. </content>
