		<content> A day at Ion Farm Wed.19 June l985    
                                       
 We start the day at 5 am when the cows
 are fetched from the field and milked.
 This is a one man job, which takes    
 approx. 2hrs twice a day, the cows    
 will be milked again at 5 pm. Between 
 the milkings the herdsman has to look 
 after the youngstock and do           
 maintenance jobs concerning the dairy 
 unit. At 7 am the man who looks after 
 the beef cattle starts work, first he 
 will look around all the animals to   
 see that they are well, then they are 
 littered up with straw so that they   
 can lie on clean beds. At 7.30 am the 
 arable workers arrive, the general    
 work today consists of repairing a    
 drain and concreting a new cover      
 into place, maintenance on the oil    
 seed rape store,spraying the wheat    
 against pests, resurfacing the floor ,</content>
