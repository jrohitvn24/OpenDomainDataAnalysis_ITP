		<title>18ATTITUDES OF TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  There are two distinct sections of   
 Tidworth as far as the population is  
 concerned; civilian and military. On  
 the whole there is little mixing done 
 on a social scale between the two.    
 Some civilians are upset by some of   
 the military personnel who abandon    
 their pets when regiments move. The   
 quarters area at Zouch and Matthew    
 Estates have a litter problem and the 
 River Bourne gets polluted by dumped  
 rubbish. Recently there has been much 
 talk about moving the county border so
 Tidworth is wholly in either Wiltshire
 or Hampshire. The old school was      
 demolished earlier this year and the  
 closure of the Station Road Post      
 Office caused much concern. The site  
 of an oil pipeline now runs along the 
 eastern edge of the village and many  
 people were saddened by the cutting   
 down of trees in the woodland.        </content>
