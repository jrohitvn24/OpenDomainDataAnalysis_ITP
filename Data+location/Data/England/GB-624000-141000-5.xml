		<title>05THE OLD SCHOOL OF ALKHAM</title>
		<content>  Up until July l972 Alkham had its own
 primary school. The building,         
 constructed in 1865 of flint and      
 brick, consisted of two rooms,        
 including a large infant room which   
 had once contained three classes. A   
 toilet block was built later. A small 
 playground occupied the area in front 
 of the school. Vicarage Meadow was    
 used for games lessons and sports     
 days. School meals were transported   
 from Lydden school and eaten in the   
 Village Hall where a small kitchen had
 been built for the use of the School  
 Meals Service. School concerts and    
 Christmas parties also took place in  
 the Hall. At the time of closure one  
 full-time and two half-time teachers  
 were employed at the school.          
 Twenty-five children were attending   
 the school drawn from Alkham, Ewell   
 Minnis and Drellingore.               </content>
