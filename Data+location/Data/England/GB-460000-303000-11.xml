		<title>11Schools in East Leicester.</title>
		<content>{Linden County Primary School:}This was
 built in 1953 as Junior &amp; Infant      
 Schools until their amalgamation in   
 1981 caused by falling rolls. There   
 are 451 pupils,17 teachers &amp; 24       
 ancillary staff. About 58% of the     
 children come from ethnic minority    
 groups with mother tongue languages   
 which include Punjabi,Urdu &amp; Greek.   
{Secondary Schools:}There are 6        
 secondary schools in the East         
 Leicester block,e.g. Judgemeadow      
 Community College is for children aged
 11-16 with a variety of courses for   
 adults as well. St.Paul's is a Roman  
 Catholic school for 11-18 year olds.  
 Because of falling rolls,Spencefield  
 School (11-16) &amp; the City of Leicester
 School (11-18) are being amalgamated  
 from August 1985.Issues to cause      
 concern are: pupils' behaviour,wearing
 school uniform &amp; a new exam system.   </content>
