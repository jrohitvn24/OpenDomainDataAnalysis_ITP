		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> On Saturday I got up at 7am .I went   
 and fed my baby rabbits and let my dog
 go for a run.I tied him up again.Paul 
 the milk man came for me at 8.30am and
 I helped him until 11.45am I had my   
 dinner and I helped my dad cleaning   
 out the shed. I went for my tea at    
 5.30pm.I had sausage,chips and        
 beans.After that I went to ride my    
 motor bike down the private lane,then 
 I watched Dynasty on T.V. until       
 11.30pm and then I went to bed.
