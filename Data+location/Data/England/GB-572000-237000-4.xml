		<content> At primary school children take part  
 in athletics,cross-country,football,  
 netball,rounders and swimming.After   
 school they use the village playing   
 field which has a slide,climbing frame
 and swings.The Brownie pack meets at  
 the Village Hall on Tuesdays and a    
 youth club is held there on Thursday  
 evenings.There is also a Sunday       
 School.Cubs,Guides and junior football
 are only available in neighbouring    
 villages.The nearest public swimming  
 pools and sports centres are several  
 miles away and parents with cars are  
 needed to enable children to use these
 facilities.Because the roads are      
 narrow and dangerous for cycling,a    
 B.M.X. track would be welcome.The     
 children would also like a tennis     
 court as this could be used by girls  
 as well as boys.
