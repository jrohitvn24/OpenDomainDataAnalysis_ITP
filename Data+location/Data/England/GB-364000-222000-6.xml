   Ryeford Farm is at the western edge 
 of our area.It has been a farm for    
 about one hundred and fifty years.It  
 is one hundred acres in size and was  
 very run down when the present owners 
 came to it three years ago.There are  
 no animals at Ryeford,it is an arable 
 farm.They grow winter wheat,winter    
 barley,main crop potatoes and rye     
 grass.It used to be a forest before it
 was a farm.                           
   At the eastern edge of the region   
 the land rises to Linton Ridge and the
 fields become smaller.There are a lot 
 of small farms along the ridge and    
 around the village of Aston           
 Crews.These are mainly stock and dairy
 farms keeping sheep,cows and pigs.
