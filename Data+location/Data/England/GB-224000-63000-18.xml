		<title>18Liskeard Museum</title>
		<content> The museum opened a few months ago but
 has already proved to be a popular    
 attraction. While small,there are many
 interesting exhibits. The walls hold  
 photographs, one of a local school in 
 1904,and several spears and flags.Also
 on display are an old typewriter,a rat
 trap,a hay knife,old helmets, an old  
 fireman's uniform and the bell which  
 used to signal the start of the cattle
 market. Of particular fascination for 
 local school children is a child's    
 Mickey Mouse gas-mask (a relic of the 
 Second World War) and a life-size     
 model of a woman,in typical costume of
 a 100 years ago , standing beside an  
 old cash till. On show too,is a book  
 containing the signature of Prince    
 Philip who visited Liskeard in 1956.  
 With free admission,the museum is open
 everyday except Sunday, from 10-4     
 week-days and until midday Saturday.  </content>
