		<content>{ROADS}- In the area we surveyed only  
 two garages were selling petrol _ at  
 Blackhorse and at Wick.               
 The{M4}motorway cuts east/west through
 the area with the{M4/M32}roundabout   
 situated at Hambrook.                 
 The main link road{A4174}becomes con- 
 gested during traffic hours. The main 
{A432}road runs north/south through the
 area from Bristol to Cirencester.     
{FRENCHAY BRIDGE}- was shut down due to
 serious damage from heavy traffic, but
 concrete bollards at each end of the  
 bridge have failed to stop its use.   
{AIR SPACE}- One of the flight paths   
 serving Filton Aerodrome is above Ham-
 brook adding to rail and road noise.  
{RAILWAYS}- The busy main London-South 
 Wales line runs through the area north
 -west of Hambrook, carrying passengers
 and freight. A tall railway viaduct   
 can be seen at Hambrook.              </content>
