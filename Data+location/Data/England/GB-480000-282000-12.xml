		<content> In the survey block there are a number
 of factories.                         
 One of these is Desborough{Light      
{Clothing Factory.}This employs 120    
 people, with about 20 of them         
 in the offices .The factory           
 manufactures overalls,corsets braziers
 and lingerie.                         
 Another factory is{Cheaney's}which    
 employs  200 people.If one gets sacked
 there is always someone waiting in    
 line for their place.                 
 Unlike certain areas in the country,  
 the area covered by the survey block  
 does not really suffer from serious   
 unemployment.                         
 School leavers normally manage to find
 employment in one of the many         
 factories, such as those mentioned    
 above or in{Rigid Containers}which    
 makes cardboard boxes.
