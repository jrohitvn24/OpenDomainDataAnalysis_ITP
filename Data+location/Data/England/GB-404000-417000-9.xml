		<content>     Sowood is approximately 1km south 
 of {Stainland.}It is on the side of a 
 hill and overlooks Jagger Green.      
      There are a lot of things in     
 Sowood which have lasted from a long  
 time ago. There are two old fashioned 
 lamp posts which were powered by gas, 
 and a post box which is set into the  
 wall with V.R. on it. Most of the     
 houses are old and built of stone, and
 many of them have fancy chimney pots. 
      Over the past few years quite a  
 few new houses have been built, such  
 as Mayfair Avenue and Greenfield      
 Close.                                
      There is an old school which was 
 built in 1879 and is now used as a    
 community centre. The playgroup, baby 
 club,dancing class and badminton group
 all meet at the centre. It is also    
 used for galas, discos and fairs.
