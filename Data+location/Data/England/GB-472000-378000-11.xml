		<title>11GROVE HUNT-ORGANISATION.</title>
		<content> The Grove and Rufford Hunt is         
 supported by a mounted field of up to 
 100,but more usually by about 50.There
 will often be a rather larger number  
 of people following in cars.This is   
 particularly so for the traditional   
 Boxing Day spectacle.Cub Hunting is an
 informal sort of hunting,taking place 
 very early in the morning, and in     
 September and October.It is during    
 this period that the contol of the fox
 population is achieved.Proper hunting 
 usually starts at 11.00.The meet for  
 fox hunting is normally a village     
 pub.Occasionally the Hunt is          
 entertained at a private house,this is
 called a lawn meeting.The hounds are  
 always counted in couples and the Hunt
 currently has 20 couples.They are     
 mainly English foxhounds,but there is 
 an increasing infusion of Welsh blood 
 lines.                                </content>
