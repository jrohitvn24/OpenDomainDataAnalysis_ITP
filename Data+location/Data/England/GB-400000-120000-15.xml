		<content> WILD LIFE - About 20 Fallow and 200   
 roe deer roam in VERNDITCH CHASE -    
 numbers are kept within limits. A few 
 foreigners pay to stalk them. There   
 are about 30 foxes controlled by the  
 Wilton Hunt. Badgers are holding their
 own, but the hare population has      
 become depleted over the last few     
 years. Grey squirrels &amp; rabbits are   
 increasing. Harvest mice, wood voles, 
 shrews and dormice abound. There are 4
 varieties of cricket. Adders &amp; grass  
 snakes can be found in the Chase, but 
 are decreasing. Slow worms are common 
 in gardens, also toads, moles and     
 hedgehogs. Glow-worms may be found on 
 the lower slopes of Marleycombe. The  
 longeared bat flies at dusk; the      
 pipistrelle can be seen in woods.     
 200 species of moths include all the 7
 hawk moths &amp; the Lappet. Many varied  
 butterflies appear on the Downs.      </content>
