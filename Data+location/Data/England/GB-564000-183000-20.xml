 The number of people who keep fit by  
 running or by jogging is a notable    
 feature of village life.  The Fun Runs
 which started in 1976 with about 30   
 people, are the focal point of this   
 activity.  They start from Westley    
 Heights and follow a picturesque route
 through woods and fields to finish at 
 The Bell.  Up to 300 people take part 
 in each of the 6 runs held every year 
 including scores of men, women and    
 children from the Village.  The tea   
 from The Bell has won the Pub Champs. 
 in the Sunday Times National Fun Run  
 each year since 1981.  The Horndon    
 10km road race run at the Feast and   
 Fayre and the half marathon are now   
 annual races.  The sight of the       
 villagers competing with famous       
 athletes inspires others to look after
 themselves by jogging or running.     </content>
