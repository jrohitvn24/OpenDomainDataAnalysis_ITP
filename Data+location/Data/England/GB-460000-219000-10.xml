		<content> 1THE ARMY MEDICAL CENTRE is a smallish
building near the NAAFI.If you are ill 
you come here.There is often a long    
wait to see the doctor.Up to 2 hours!  
Before you get to see the doctor you   
make an appointment.You come in &amp; sit  
down.Usually there are a few magazines 
to read while waiting.A lady calls your
name&amp; you go through to another Waiting
Room &amp; then into the Surgery.When I    
went the doctor was Asian.He looked at 
my foot &amp; wrote a note which he told me
to take next door where a nurse gave me
a tube of Glaxo Dermorate Cream.Back in
the Waiting Room as usual there were   
lots of mothers &amp; babies. (K. WHITE)   
  BINGO is a popular game played weekly
in the Village Hall from 7.15\9.30.Aman
calls a number &amp; you cross it out if it
is on your card.When all your numbers  
are crossed out you shout"House"orBingo
&amp; you win some money. (LEE WEBBER).    </content>
