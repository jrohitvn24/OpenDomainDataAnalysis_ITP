		<content> ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ABOUT LIVING IN   
 THE COUNTRY IS THE LACK OF TRANSPORT. 
 PEOPLE HAVE TO USE THEIR OWN CARS, AS 
 THERE IS VERY LITTLE PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
 IN THE VILLAGE OUT OF 76 PEOPLE       
 QUESTIONED, 53 HAD CARS AND 23 HAD    
 NOT.  PEOPLE WHO HAD NO TRANSPORT     
 WERE OFTEN GIVEN LIFTS TO RIPON       
 MARKET OR TO HOSPITAL, IF THEY HAD    
 TO VISIT FRIENDS AND RELATIONS.  THE  
 ONLY PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS A POST-BUS,  
 WHICH CARRIES 11 PASSENGERS, AND      
 TRAVELS UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY FROM   
 MASHAM TO RIPON, TWICE A DAY AS IT    
 COLLECTS THE MAIL. THIS IT DOES       
 EVERY DAY EXCEPT THURSDAYS,           
 SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS. ON THURSDAY    
 AT 10.40A.M. AND SATURDAY AT          
 9.10A.M. THE UNITED BUS COMPANY RUN   
 A SERVICE BUS INSTEAD.  IT IS MOSTLY  
 OLDER PEOPLE WHO USE THE PUBLIC       
 TRANSPORT ON THURSDAYS.              Y</content>
