		<content> With so few dwellings and such a small
 population, employment is either with 
 the Forestry Commission, in nearby    
 towns or on the small farms. A few    
 cattle are grazed on the meadows in   
 the loop of the Little Ouse and there 
 is a small acreage of arable for wheat
 grass or sugarbeet. In the N.W. corner
 public access is banned as the M.O.D. 
 use it for Army manoeuvres.           
 The only public roads are 2 miles of  
 the A134, 1.5 miles of minor road (was
 B1108) and the minor road north from  
 Santon Downham. There is also an      
 ancient trackway. (See Page 3)        
 There is no railway station and no    
 bus-stop even if and when buses or    
 coaches traverse the area.
