		<title>06A Day In The Life Of Helen</title>
		<content> My name is Helen I am 10 years old.on 
 a typical school day I usually awake  
 at 7.30am and lay in bed for a few    
 minutes feeling tired then I push my  
 quilt back reluctantly. After a       
 breakfast of weetabix and toast I go  
 upstairs to brush my teeth,comb my    
 hair then have to rush around because 
 it is twenty to nine. I collect my    
 coat and bag then leave  for school.  
 At school I meet my friends and wait  
 for the bell to go. The Bell goes at  
 nine o' clock and we go into school   
 for registration. We usually have an  
 enlish lesson first. Then at ten      
 thirty we have a break. After break we
 have hymn practice. Hymn practice is  
 where we practice songs.Then we go    
 back for a maths lesson.
