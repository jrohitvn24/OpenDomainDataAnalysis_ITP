		<content> Most entertainment in our block is    
 organised by the people themselves    
 for their own entertainment,rather    
 than being organised by outside comp- 
 anies.Much of this activity is also   
 fund raising for some good causes.    
 Coffee evenings,cheese and wine part- 
 ies,Domino,Whist and Beetle drives,   
 Barn dances,Discos,Bingo and sponsored
 events are all fund raising,fun       
 events.                               
    Many people try to keep fit as well
 as enjoying themselves with activities
 like Squash,Badminton,Tennis,Aerobics 
 and there are quite a few Weight      
 Watchers.                             
    The Womens Institute plays a large 
 part in activites for ladies in area. 
 They have talks,slide shows,sports,   
 outings and take part in local fairs. 
    Visits to the pub and various hobb-
 ies also fill many leisure hours.     </content>
