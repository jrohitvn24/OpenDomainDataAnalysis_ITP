		<title>09MACHINERY AT ACKTON HALL PIT</title>
		<content> Machinery is very useful in producing 
 coal and bringing it to the surface.  
 Many of the machines used in the      
 mining industry today are high        
 powered and expensive. An example is  
 the{RH25 road header}which rip into   
 the coal face and loosen tons of      
 material, a high powered jet of water 
 sprays round the drill to prevent     
 sparking on the blades. Obviously such
 safety features are a necessity since 
 quantities of explosive gas may be    
 present. Also Dowty support shields   
 4/280T are used on difficult seams.   
   The machinery for Ackton Hall       
 Colliery comes from 2 places,         
 Andersons Strathclyde PLC tunneling   
 equipment unit or a supplier in       
 Doncaster. The pit is due for closure 
 and the machinery will be sent to     
 other collieries.
