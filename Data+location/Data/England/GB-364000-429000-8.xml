 The children mainly play around the   
 roads skipping, roller-skating or     
 biking. Sometimes for a change they go
 to a roller-skating rink to play or   
 the swiming baths, or, occasionally   
 visit the cinema.                     
 In the area a wide range of people can
 be found ranging from the poor to the 
 wealthy. All kinds of people can be   
 found in{Corporation Park}, playing   
 bowls, tennis  or just strolling      
 along. In Blackburn most people have  
 friends who they can turn to in their 
 social circle and although a lot of   
 talk behind people's backs goes on    
 with the neighbours they are usually  
 not too uncaring about people's       
 feelings. Unemployment has affected a 
 lot of people in the area, but people 
 do not drop their standards and are   
 mostly clean and tidy.                </content>
