		<content>          I enjoyed taking part in this
 Project. We went on many visits. The  
 best was to{Towerlands Equestrian     
{Centre.}Several ladies from the       
{Shalford Womens Institute}and some    
 mums took us, in their cars, on the   
 visits.                               
      We took with us tape recorder and
 cameras. We met many interesting and  
 helpful people. After the visits we   
 wrote about them - which was not much 
 fun! We made models, did paintings,   
 spinning and clay work and made       
 mobiles. At the end of term we had an 
 exhibition of all our work. Our       
 parents, people who had helped us in  
 various ways, local residents and a   
 newspaper reporter came. A photo and  
 report was printed in the{Essex       
{Chronicle.}The{Technical Officer}from 
 the{Telephone Exchange}gave two prizes
 for the best work about the Exchange. </content>
