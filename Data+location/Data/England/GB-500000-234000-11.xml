		<title>11STEPPINGLEY, NEAR FLITWICK.</title>
		<content>    STEPPINGLEY IS A SMALL VILLAGE     
 ABOUT ONE MILE FROM FLITWICK, WITH A  
 POPULATION OF ABOUT 150. THE ROAD     
 WINDS THROUGH THE VILLAGE WITH HIGH   
 BANKS ON EITHER SIDE.                 
  IN THE CENTRE IS THE CHURCH OF ST.   
 LAWRENCE, BUILT BY THE DUKE OF BEDFORD
 ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO, AS WAS THE SCHOOL
 WHICH IS NOW A PRIVATE RESIDENCE.     
 THE POST OFFICE, OPPOSITE THE CHURCH, 
 IS RUN FROM ONE ROOM OF A QUAINT      
 THATCHED COTTAGE. NEXT TO THE CHURCH  
 IS 'THE FRENCH HORN', A RESTAURANT AND
 PUBLIC HOUSE.                         
  ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE VILLAGE  
 IS PEAKES END, WHERE THERE IS A LARGE 
 THATCHED COTTAGE CALLED 'THE CROFT'.  
 THIS STANDS BY ITSELF FACING A SMALL  
 GREEN, WHERE VILLAGE FUNCTIONS ARE    
 HELD. THERE IS ALSO A DISUSED WESLEYAN
 METHODIST CHAPEL, WHICH HAS BEEN      
 CONVERTED INTO A PRIVATE HOUSE.       </content>
