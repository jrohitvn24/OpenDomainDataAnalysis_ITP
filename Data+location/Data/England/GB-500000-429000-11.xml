		<title>11KIRKELLA VILLAGE DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The first thing that struck me was how
 quiet and relaxed the village is      
 compared to my street in Hull.In the  
 last census the population was        
 2110.The place still retains its      
 distinct identity despite a lot of    
 recent building activity.The centre of
 the village is at the meeting of      
 Church, Packman,Godman and School     
 lanes.Here you find the medieval      
 church of St. Andrew's, the Wheatsheaf
 Inn (an old coaching inn),the village 
 school(originally a C.of E.           
 school) and the post office and       
 village store. The last to are housed 
 in a converted blacksmith's           
 forge.Standing at the church lytch    
 gate and staring at the timber and    
 plaster Forge shop it is easy to see  
 the village as it was many years ago.
