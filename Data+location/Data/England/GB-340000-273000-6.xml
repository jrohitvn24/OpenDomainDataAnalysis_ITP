 important to have a shop in           
 Leintwardine. They usually spend      
 Â£1000-Â£1800  per week. February and   
 March are their busiest months.       
 Leintwardine people tend to go to     
 either Ludlow or Leominster at the    
 weekend to shop.{                     
{Bank.}In the village of Leintwardine  
 there is one Midland Bank.It is a     
 small Bank with only two staff.It is  
 only open on Monday and Friday from   
 10a.m till 2p.m. The staff thought it 
 was important to have a Bank in       
 Leintwardine because all ages banked  
 there and very few people went to     
 another town to Bank.                 
{Post Office.}It does not only sell    
 stamps but it sells sweets, a few     
 toys, seeds, cards and you can hire   
 videos. Their weekly takings vary     
 greatly.                              </content>
