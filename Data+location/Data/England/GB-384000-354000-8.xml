		<content>MR. BURTON - CHAIRMAN OF PACKMOOR      
SCHOOL GOVERNORS. A PERSONAL VIEW      
MR. BURTON HAS LIVED IN PACKMOOR FOR   
FIFTY YEARS. HE DID NOT THINK PACKMOOR 
HAD CHANGED EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT   
ONCE EVERYONE WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO   
EACH OTHER. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE NOW IS 
THAT WHERE A 'CLANNISH' COMMUNITY      
EXISTED THERE ARE NOW MORE OUTSIDERS.  
PACKMOOR GETS ITS NAME FROM THE PACK   
HORSES WHICH WERE ONCE USED TO CARRY   
GOODS TO AND FROM THE VILLAGE. I       
THOUGHT IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE THE     
PEOPLE USED TO PACK THEIR THINGS       
NEATLY! MANY LOCAL PEOPLE USED TO WORK 
AT EITHER VICTORIA COLLIERY OR         
CHATTERLEY WHITFIELD. SOME WORKED AT   
THE LOCAL IRON WORKS. ALL THESE        
INDUSTRIES HAVE NOW CLOSED DOWN.
