		<content>      My name is Maree.  I am 11 years 
 old.  I live in{Accrington.}On{       
{Saturdays} I get out of bed about 1O  
 o'clock because I'm not at school.  If
 I was at school I'd have to get up at 
 7.OO a.m.  I get up, get dressed, have
 a wash then I go down town.  I go to  
 the{open market}and hear a lot of     
 shouting, running, cars and my brother
 'nagging' my mum to buy him things.  I
 like going to shops such as{Woolworth 
{and Marks &amp; Spencers.}We always go to 
 the Market.  We buy all the food for  
 the week days such as fruit and       
 vegetables and beefburgers.  When we  
 get home we unpack and put all the    
 food in the fridge and cupboard.  We  
 then sit down, have our dinner and    
 watch television.  I go for walks with
 the dog.  I like taking the dog out   
 over an old overgrown railway.
