		<content>    An  airship  is an enornous balloon
 filled with a gas lighter than air. It
 is  fitted with engines and steered by
 rudders.  The  crew  guide  the  craft
 from  a gondola under the main  frame.
 When  airships  were  first built they
 were  thought  to be the only possible
 means of flying for passengers.       
                                       
    The   R101   which   was   built at
 Cardington  was  777  feet  long   and
 weighed  about  167 tons. It  was made
 of  steel  and  filled with hydrogen a
 very  dangerous  gas.  It  crashed  in
 Beauvais  France  on  October 5th 1930
 whilst attempting to fly to India. All
 but a few were lost. This was the last
 British effort to fly large airships.
