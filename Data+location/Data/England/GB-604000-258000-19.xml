		<content>   Mr Lance Mayhew remembers Stowmarket
as it was before the First World War.  
The market was larger then, spreading  
from the Market Place into Crowe       
Street,and including small livestock-  
chickens, rabbits- which are no longer 
seen today.  Beneath the Market Place  
were the vaults used by a firm of wine 
merchants, no longer in the town, and  
the Corn Exchange was visible instead  
of being merged into various buildings 
as it is now.                          
         There were two windmills along
Bury St, as well as some pig-sties.    
       Goods were distributed mostly by
horse and cart, but there were a few   
steam lorries and the machinery at     
Clover's Mill was steam-powered.       
    Great excitement was caused when   
Lord Kitchener visited Stowmarket to   
inspect troops.                        
                                       </content>
