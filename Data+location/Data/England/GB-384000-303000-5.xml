		<title>05Farming in the Codsall area</title>
		<content>About 10 of the 12 sq.kms. are rural.  
Mixed farming is most important on many
different sized farms. Among crops     
being grown in June l985 were grass for
grazing,silage and hay, kale, potatoes,
barley, wheat, oil seed rape, swedes,  
sugar beet and peas. Animals kept      
included sheep, store lambs,dairy cows,
hens and horses. Dairying is important 
because of Codsall's proximity to the  
West Midlands. There are several riding
stables. Codsall was once important in 
the horticultural field and nurseries  
belonging to Baker's Ltd. covered many 
acres. These were sold off during the  
1960's. Baker's Way and Baker's Gardens
are street names reminding us of those 
days. They are also recalled by the    
Russell Lupin, an attractive, multi-   
coloured flower which was developed in 
Codsall during the 1930's by the late  
George Russell M.B.E.                  </content>
