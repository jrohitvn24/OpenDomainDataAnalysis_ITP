		<content> is barely surviving as a separate     
 entity - kept alive by its two inns   
 and its caravan/campsite.  Similarly, 
 all new building is, at present,      
 taking place in and around Slimbridge 
 so any community growth is bound to   
 take place there leaving Cambridge to 
 remain as almost a living museum for  
 future generations.                   
      The steady growth of Slimbridge  
 in recent times has partly been       
 brought about by the good road links  
 enjoyed by the area which mean that   
 residents can quickly reach several   
 large towns or cities.  Consequently, 
 there is a very real danger that there
 will be an even greater demand for    
 residential accommodation in the area 
 with an inevitable loss of some of the
 local countryside.
