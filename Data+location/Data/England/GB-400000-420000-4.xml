		<content>{The Village Shop and Post Office}could
 be under threat because the new       
 commuters have little need for these  
 facilities.Many worry thet there is no
 work in the area and that{travelling} 
 is awkward and expensive.Many object  
 to any industry except some rural     
 crafts.The area has suffered from {   
{acid rain pollution}from the adjoining
 industrial areas indicated by the     
 partly barren moorland but local      
 people feel that because of the demise
 of the textile and engineering        
 industry there is less acid rain on   
 the moors.{Harrier Jets}flying low    
 over the area cause some alarm.The    
 area suffers from occasional vandalism
 burglary and the influx of many {motor
{bike scramblers}who have little       
 respect for the environment
