		<title>09The Gurdwara</title>
		<content>  The Guru Nanak Sikh Temple or        
 Gurdwara was opened in November 1978  
 making use of a building formally     
 occupied by Armstrong Stevens Ltd. as 
 works offices. The original building  
 was extended and  in November 1981 the
 new building was opened. Prior to the 
 provision of this amenity, worshippers
 were forced to travel to Gurdwaras in 
 Walsall or Wolverhampton.             
  The main function of the Gurdwara is 
 to promote the Sikh faith, but        
 ceremonies such as weddings, funerals 
 and choosing of children's names are  
 performed there also. About 500 people
 attend Gurdwara each week. Most come  
 from the local area but anyone is     
 welcome.                              
  Work is at present underway to       
 improve the catering facilities at the
 Gurdwara.
