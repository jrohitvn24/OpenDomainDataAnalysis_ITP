		<content>I like to collect dolls because they   
look nice on my shelf and make my      
bedroom pretty. My favourite dolls are 
the smaller ones like the lacemaker.   
Another has a net or a veil over her   
head and blue dress. I also like to    
read Look In, some of them are quite   
funny. I like writing stories and I    
would like to write them for young and 
old people when I grow up. I collect   
soaps that smell nice. I also collect  
keyrings, rubbers and my old school    
work. I take my dog for a walk and     
sometimes I go rollerskating or ride my
bike with my freinds like Helen. We    
sometimes watch television together. My
brother plays football or with his Lego
and we go swimming when we can.
