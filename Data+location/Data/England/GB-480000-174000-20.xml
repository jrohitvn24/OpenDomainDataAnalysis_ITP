		<title>20Changes in Waltham St L.</title>
		<content>   There is change taking place all the
 time in the villages,  houses are     
 being extended or demolished,  shops  
 are closing or changing use and people
 are moving into and out of the area.  
                                       
   The traditional village population  
 is changing as the very high price of 
 property is forcing local people to   
 move away to make room for wealthy    
 commuters.  Farming methods mean fewer
 and fewer men work on the land as     
 machines take over.                   
                                       
   The area is now{Green Belt}so there 
 will be very little new building to   
 change the rural character of the     
 area.
