		<content> North Luffenham and Edith Weston are  
 villages belonging to the District of 
 Rutland in the County of              
 Leicestershire.                       
 North Luffenham was probably so called
 because ham means village (Old        
 English) and Luffa - out of the wind. 
 St. Edward the Confessor left Rutland 
 to Editha, his wife, and Edith Weston 
 was named after her.                  
 The buildings of the area are mainly  
 stone and they are surrounded by      
 undulating land largely used for      
 arable farming.                       
 In the Parish of Edith Weston lies    
 R.A.F. North Luffenham.               
 To the north of Edith Weston is       
 Rutland Water, a large man-made       
 reservoir.                            
 Bordering the lake is a centre for    
 water activities.
