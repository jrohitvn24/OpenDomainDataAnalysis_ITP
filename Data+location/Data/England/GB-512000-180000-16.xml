		<title>16HOUSES IN SOUTHALL</title>
		<content>{A SURVEY OF 35 HOUSES IN ASCOT GDNS.  
{SOUTHALL}            -Barry Clarke    
    All houses were terraced apart from
 three that were semi-detached. 94% had
 pebble dashed walls.                  
    The new style of double glazing was
 quite popular, but still the majority 
 of people had old wooden windows.     
    Where I live people like gardening 
 because only a few didn't have flowery
 gardens (back or front). These houses 
 were mainly surrounded by a wall or   
 hedge. Nearly every house had either a
 garage or a shed.                     
      {RESULTS OF MY SURVEY}           
 The houses had the following features:
 Extention 26%, Terraced 89%, Semis.9%,
