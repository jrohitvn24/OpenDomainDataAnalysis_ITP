		<title>12THE SPRUISTIES</title>
		<content>   The{Spruisties}take up the largest  
 area of farmland in Killinghall. They 
 lie to the east of the village and    
 embrace the farms of Spruisty Grange, 
 Spruisty Hall, Little Spruisty, and   
 Spruisty Hill.  They are owned by the 
 Umpelby Family.                       
   Mr Charlie Umpelby has in his       
 possession, deeds written on sheepskin
 which go back to 1624 and a stone     
 plaque over the door shows Spruity    
 Hall Farm to have been built in 1620. 
 The Umpelby family have owned Spruisty
 for over 100 years, originally being  
 rented and later bought by Mr. Charlie
 Umpelby's father.                     
   All the corn grown on Spruisty was  
 sent to Knox Mill for grinding but    
 later a nill was bought and all       
 grinding done on the farm. They are   
 now dairy farms supporting five       
 families.                             </content>
