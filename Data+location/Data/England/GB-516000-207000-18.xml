		<content> These are the animals we saw at the   
 farm at Oaklands College. There are   
 120 Friesian{cows}some of which are   
 calves. The cows only give milk after 
 the birth of their{first calf}and are 
 milked at 6am and 3 p.m. It takes only
 a few seconds. Oaklands Farm have 85  
 ewes. They usually have 2{lambs}each  
 between February and March. When the  
 lambs are 35kg they are sold to the   
 meat trade and in December the ewes   
 are sheared. The{pigs}are of the{Large
{White}breed and most{sows}have around 
 12{piglets.}At 6 weeks they are taken 
 to the fattening house.
