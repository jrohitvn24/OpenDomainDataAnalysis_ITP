		<title>18MISUSE OF SAMPFORD LAND</title>
		<content> This area wherever you stand consists 
 mainly of farmland with woodland      
 dotted here and there.  The River Pant
 meanders through the fields.  There is
 little evidence of inhabitants except 
 for farm houses seen in the distance. 
 Unfortunately, this idylic scene is   
 spoilt from wherever you look.  Huge  
 unsightly pylons are placed in the    
 fields.  There stark silouhette is    
 seen for miles.  Each of these pylons 
 is joined to the next by thick        
 electric wires carrying thousands of  
 volts of electricity across the       
 countryside.  Electricity is the main 
 form of power in the Sampfords.  Most 
 people use if for heating, lighting   
 and cooking.  No gas is piped into the
 village.  If people want to use gas as
 a service they need to use calor gas. 
 The containers are stored in the      
 gardens.                              </content>
