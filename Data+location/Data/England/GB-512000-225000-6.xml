		<title>06A DAY IN MY LIFE, contd.</title>
		<content>   That happens every morning and when 
 we are all ready my brother Christian 
 always needs the 'loo'.  At 8.30 we   
 sprint to the bus and go to school.   
   When we get there, Lucy and Joanne  
 check the reading records and Mrs.    
 Brown takes the register. Then we give
 our dinner money to Mrs.Ganderton.    
 After this, we have assembly; we sing 
 some hymns and after a story we go    
 back to the classroom. In the morning 
 we do Peak Maths. Our morning break is
 at 10.30; we play things like knife,  
 fork, spoon, spear and horses. After  
 play we watch our television programme
 which is Zig Zag. At 12.00 we have    
 lunch; I am a server, as are all the  
 fourth years. After lunch we go out to
 play. When we come in, we work until  
 2.40, when Mrs.Aldridge arrives to    
 teach us poetry and  drama.
