		<content> This is a peaceful country lane which 
 used to be one of the carters' tracks 
 down into Dartmouth.Up near the toll  
 house we found these flowers,Foxglove,
 Meadow Vetchling,Birdsfoot Trefoil,St.
 John's Wort,Red Campion,Scabious and  
 Yarrow.The North bank had a hedge     
 along it and we counted 4 tree species
 in 100m,Oak,Gorse,Blackthorn and      
 Elder.We saw an old barn made of      
 bricks and stone and had a clear view 
 across Start Bay.The building next to 
 the town water tower used to be an    
 abbattoir,now it used as a car repair 
 shop.They're building a rugby pitch   
 nearby.The pitch is just being        
 straightened out.It will be ready in  
 about 5 months time.
