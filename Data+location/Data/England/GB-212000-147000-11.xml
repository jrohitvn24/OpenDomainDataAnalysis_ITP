		<title>11The Boat Trip Round Lundy.</title>
		<content> On Wednesday we went on a boat trip   
 around the island.We split up into two
 groups.I went with Mrs.Dench's group. 
 She went first on the boat.Mr.Hanks   
 took twelve boys to Rat Island to see 
 some divers.Before we went around the 
 island we had to get on a little boat 
 (six at a time)to get on a bigger     
 boat.When the twelve of us were on the
 boat we started to go.We saw lots of  
 Guillemots and Razor Bills.There was a
 wrecked ship and it was rusty.It was  
 only part of a boat because the rest  
 of it had been washed somewhere.There 
 was a Kittiwake following us but when 
 we got faster it couldn't keep up.    
 We had to go fast to go round the     
 corner and around some rocks.We saw   
 about ten seals, two or three were    
 sitting on rocks.We waved to one of   
 the seals and it looked like it waved 
 back with his tail! (continued)       </content>
