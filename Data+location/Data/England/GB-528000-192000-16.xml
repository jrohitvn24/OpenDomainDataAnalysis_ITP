		<content> Our school is situated in New         
 Southgate. There are two Southgates.  
 One is the original Old Southgate and 
 ours is the later development. Most of
 the houses in our area are quite old. 
 The average age is about 100 years. In
 some places the houses were so old    
 they were forming 'slum areas'and had 
 to be pulled down. There are quite a  
 few new developments in our area,     
 mostly taking the form of council     
 estates. A council estate is built by 
 the government and the dwellings are  
 rented out to the tenants. We also    
 have a number of 'sky_rise' blocks of 
 flats. Some are as high as 30 floors. 
 We have local shops and services and  
 two stations are located in our area; 
 New Southgate main line and Arnos     
 Grove underground. We also have plenty
 of buses serving the area.
