		<content> The population has grown rapidly with 
 new people commuting to jobs in nearby
 towns. Look at the War Memorial,      
 though, and notice that many names    
 thereon still exist in the village.   
 So, a solid core of old families still
 linger on.                            
                                       
 There is a thriving Play School in the
 village and a lively Girl Guide troop.
                                       
 Each year, the village gala provides  
 entertainment with lots of stalls,    
 games and a display of dancing by the 
 village school. The Drama Group puts  
 on shows several times ayear and the  
 November Bonfire has become an annual 
 event.                                
                                       
 Each household receives news of events
 each month via the new village        
 magazine which won an award in 1985.  </content>
