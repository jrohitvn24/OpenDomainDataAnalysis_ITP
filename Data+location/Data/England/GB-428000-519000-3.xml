		<title>03Local History in Brafferton</title>
		<content> The area around Brafferton is an area 
 well established with a long          
 history.Recently discovered is the    
{Medieval Village}of Coatham Mundeville
 which was examined by people from     
 Newcastle University. Near by are two 
 ancient monuments, a church which has 
 been converted into a house and a     
 farm, part of Coatham Hall Farm, which
 is being modernised. Near to the      
 railway line by Hill Banks is the site
 of an{Anglo-Saxon settlement.}        
                                       
  Close by are Ketton Hall, which was a
 monastry,and Ketton Bridge which was a
 pack horse route for{salt.}Farmers    
 have found pottery in the area from   
 the Carthusian monastry which was     
 part of Durham Priory. Within this    
 area too, is Peartree House which is  
 actually mentioned in the{Domesday}   
{Book.}                                </content>
