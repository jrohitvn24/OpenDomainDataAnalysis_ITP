		<title>19MY MILK ROUND</title>
		<content> I help a milkman on Saturday mornings 
 and Thursday nights. This is harder   
 now that we deliver Sunday's milk on  
 saturday. The milkman is a cheery sort
 of character as he is always full of  
 bounce and joy. Even when things go   
 wrong, such as leaving people out, he 
 just takes it with a pinch of salt.   
 When he calls at houses for money he  
 always asks them if they would like   
 anything else, trying to increase his 
 goods balance. When I ask them they   
 try to be polite but nearly always say
 no. One of the main "let-downs" on our
 round is the float. It is a 'J' reg.  
 and only has a top speed of ten miles 
 per hour. One day last week Reg had to
 swop floats because he just ran out of
 electicity. We were about half way    
 round when it just wouldn't go, so we 
 telephoned the dairy and they brought 
 out another one.                      </content>
