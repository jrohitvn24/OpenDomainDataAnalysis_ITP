		<title>03GEOLOGY OF BRAILES</title>
		<content>  The valley in which the village of   
 Brailes lies, and the lower slopes of 
 Brailes Hill, are formed of yellow and
 buff silty clay known as the Middle   
 Lias silts.The Marlstone Rock Bed     
 above the silts is very thin and on   
 top of that, the higher slopes of the 
 hill are formed of Upper Lias Clay.   
 Many years ago this was dug for       
 making bricks and tiles in the local  
 brickworks.                           
  The hill cap is formed of ferruginous
 and calcareous sandstone called       
 Northampton Sands.Round the topmost   
 clump of trees,named Highwall Spinney,
 is an area of pale sandstone and      
 Chipping Norton limestone.Along the   
 base of the Northampton Sands is a    
 series of springs which yield small   
 supplies of water to individual farms 
 and houses on the hillside.
