		<title>07Houses in Stanground</title>
		<content> The housing in Stanground is in two   
 main areas;to the north and south of  
 the main Peterbough to Whittlesey     
 Road.To the south is the Oakdale      
 Estate which was begun in the late    
 1950's when the area began to be      
 developed to provide homes in the     
 expanding city of{Peterborough}.Houses
 on this estate are mainly             
 semi-detached with a few detached     
 houses and bungalows.All are privately
 owned,and in 1985 may be purchased for
 between Â£20.000 and Â£30,000.          
  To the north is a large council      
 estate consisting of terraced         
 houses,semi-detached dwellings and    
 some flats.These houses were begun as 
 developments after the war,and the    
 estate has been added to throughout   
 the 1960's and 1970's.The council     
 estate is adjoined by private housing 
 on the Park Farm Estate.              </content>
