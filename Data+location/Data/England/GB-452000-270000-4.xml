		<title>04The Barby Church</title>
		<content>   Barby Church is called St.Mary's.   
 Rev.Scott is called the Rector in     
 Barby. Barby Church is 750 years old. 
 One of the well known names in Barby  
 is Pittom. There is a line of graves  
 with the Pittom name on in the Church 
 yard. A lane is called Pittoms Lane   
 and Mrs.Pittom runs the Village Hall. 
   Inside the Church there are four    
 pointed arches either side of the     
 building. The Church has got five     
 bells, an organ, a piano, an altar and
 a side-altar. On top of the Church    
 there is a cockerel. The font is 8    
 sided and also has a wooden lid. There
 has recently been a new roof put on   
 the Church and Â£20,000 was raised. The
 lectern was made out of cast iron and 
 it was in the shape of an eagle.      
 Outside the Church there is a memorial
 to the Great War.
