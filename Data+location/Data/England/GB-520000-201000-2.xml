		<content> There is a stud farm on Ridgehill     
 which also delivers horses.  It has   
 its own riding school and show jumping
 team.  There's a practice paddock and 
 a large field that is used for annual 
 show jumping events during the summer.
                                       
 Adjoining Mimms Hall was a livery     
 stables, looking after horses for     
 local residents and others.           
                                       
 There were other fields in the area   
 full of horses. There are lots of     
 pony-trekking tracks and bridle paths 
 all over the area, but this is not    
 because the local residents are poor -
 lots of the houses had two cars.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
