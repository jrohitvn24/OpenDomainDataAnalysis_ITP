		<content>  This morning my dad woke me up at    
 6.45am. for breakfast.I then had a    
 shower.After that I prepared myself   
 for school.As I had some spare time I 
 played on my dad's computer.          
  I set off for school at 8.15 walking 
 through the fields.It is about half a 
 mile from the school to my house.I    
 arrived at 8.30.At 9.05 I went into   
 our school hall for assembly.         
  At 9.30 Mr.Allan gave us our weekly  
 test.At 10.40 I went out to play      
 until 10.55. I did some work on the   
 Domesday Project until 12.00.I had    
 lunch then I went out to play.

 local area on a map.I was working on  
 this until 2.20.
