		<title>12UPLAND FARMING-HOLKER MOSS.</title>
		<content>   The farming in the east of the area 
 is dominated by{sheep.}Most of the    
 land is high and rocky and in places  
 is very steep.The soils are mostly    
 thin and acidic and support only rough
 grasses.These conditions combine to   
 make sheep farming the only viable    
 agricultural activity.The main breeds 
 of sheep found in this area are{      
{Suffolks}and{Swaledales.}The sheep are
 grazed on the fells during the more   
 favourable weather but are brought to 
 more sheltered areas in winter and for
 lambing purposes.Other important jobs 
 of the year include dipping and       
 shearing.On small holdings in the area
 poultry such as{geese,bantams}and     
{chickens}are reared.                  
   Some of the land is wooded providing
 a small amount of{forestry}activity.  
   Produce from this area is mostly    
 sold at Ulverston market.             </content>
