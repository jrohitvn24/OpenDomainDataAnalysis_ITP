		<title>15Malmesbury Abbey</title>
		<content>{The Abbey}has been rebuilt 4 times    
 since 767.The present building has    
 been there from the 12th century.The  
 Abbey's spire collapsed in 1480.Only  
 one fifth of the original building is 
 left.Every year approximately 2,000   
 people from many different countries  
 come to see our Abbey.Inside there is 
 a{new organ}which cost Â£72,000 to be  
 made.It has got about 3,000 pipes in  
 it.The Abbey is used for{weddings,    
{funerals,christenings,concerts}and it 
 also acts as a{parish church.}The     
 Abbey can hold 300 people             
 comfortably.But it has been known to  
 hold 1,000 people,who were all very   
 squashed.One of the stained glass     
 windows has a picture of{Oliver       
{(Elmer) the flying monk}who jumped off
 the Abbey.A lot of the Abbey has been 
 replaced.
