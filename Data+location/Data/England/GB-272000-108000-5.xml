 ask thirty six children,and the{jobs} 
 worked out as follows:-Farmers-10;    
 Office workers 8; Lorry drivers 4; Pub

 council workers 2; and there was one  
 each fireman , lift repairer ,washing 
 machine repairer .Every single one who
 had to{travel},went by car or motor   
 bike . Not a singie person travelled  
 by {public transport}and nearly every
