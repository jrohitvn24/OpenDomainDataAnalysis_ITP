		<title>18TERLING GHOSTS BY JONATHAN</title>
		<content> I live at Vine Cottage, which is 635  
 years old and is opposite the Church. 
 It has a lovely Crown Post in the roof
 and a Cellar, which was used as a     
 dairy in my Great Grandmother's time. 
 We have two ghosts, but they are not  
 very old. One was my Grandad's Auntie 
 Maud, whose body is buried under the  
 fir tree in Terling Churchyard. She   
 lived here and was an asthmatic and   
 bedridden, and when she wanted        
 anything, would bang with her stick on
 the floor. My Mum and Dad have often  
 heard banging from the front bedroom, 
 but have never seen her ghost. Our    
 other ghost seems to like ornaments   
 and jewellery and hides them, then    
 puts them back, like my Mum's ring,   
 which was missing for 3 weeks, then   
 suddenly appeared in the middle of the
 front room floor. Also ornaments have 
 disappeared from a locked room.       </content>
