		<title>14West Newton School</title>
		<content> The school, a Voluntary Aided Primary 
 School, was built at the same time as 
 the majority of the village, around   
 1870.                                 
 It is a typical village school        
 consisting of two rooms, an infant    
 room for 4 to 7 year olds, and a      
 Junior room for the 7 to 11 year olds.
                                       
 Two teachers teach about thirty       
 children in mixed age and ability     
 classes. Much of the work is          
 individually based and because of this
 and the close relationship between    
 teacher and pupil, the children       
 transfer to their secondary schools   
 both confident and competent          
                                       
 In addition to the normal school      
 activities, the children go on School 
 Journeys and trips.                   
 It is a bright and cheerful place.    </content>
