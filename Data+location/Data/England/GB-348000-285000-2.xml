		<content>   Diddlebury Church is the only C.E.  
 church on our map.It dates back to    
 Saxon times.The north wall has very   
 conspicuous herring bone patterns in  
 stone work.It is one of the finest    
 examples of 11th century building.The 
 chancel is mostly Norman.             
                                       
   The vicar of the church is the Rev  
 I.Gibbs who is vicar of 5 churches.At 
 Diddlebury church there are 2 wardens 
 and Fred Jordan is the sexton.There   
 are about 3 weddings a year and in May
 and June there were 2 christenings and
 1 funeral.                            
                                       
   The service times are 9.00am 10.00am
 6.30pm but not on the same sunday.The 
 last comfirmation was 5 years ago but 
 no one is interested enough to want to
 be comfirmed at present.
