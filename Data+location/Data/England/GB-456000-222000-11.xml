		<title>11LIFE IN BICESTER</title>
		<content>LIFE STYLES:Bicester is a small market 
town and quite a close community.      
There is a wide cross-section of people
- top personalities in the villages    
and locals who have been here for      
generations.There is very little       
entertainment in Bicester itself.There 
are two good restaurants and two hotels
which hold occasional social functions.
There are two youth clubs and a snooker
club. In the main, most people travel  
away from Bicester to follow cultural  
interests and find entertainment.      
SHOPPING:Bicester contains a wide      
variety of shopping facilities.Most    
articles can be obtained locally, both 
household goods and clothing.          
HEALTH:Two practices operate from the  
Health Centre,covering a 7 mile radius.
HOUSING:Bicester is continually growing
with new estates on the edge of town.In
the centre,flats have been built.      </content>
