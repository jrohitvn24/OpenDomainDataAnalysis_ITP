		<title>12BRAMLEY STATION</title>
		<content> In 1985,at Bramley Station there are  
 Inter-City,goods,local passenger and  
 trains that stop more frequently than 
 the Inter-City trains between Reading 
 and the south-west.                   
 School children,businessmen-commuting 
 to London,workers,and shoppers all use
 the train.People might use the train  
 because it is more frequent than the  
 bus service,quicker-especially from   
 Bramley to Basingstoke and you don't  
 get stuck in traffic jams!            
 In Bramley a person who works on the  
 railway might,issue or collect tickets
 and work on the platform.It is shift  
 work-early shift from 7a.m.to 4p.m.and
 late from 2p.m.to 10p.m.              
 At present the railway uniforms are   
 dark blue hats jackets and            
 trousers.The hats have a coloured band
 coded according to the duties the     
 wearer performs.                      </content>
