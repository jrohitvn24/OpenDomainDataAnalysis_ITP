 The building consisted of a main room 
 and a smaller room.  The log book     
 notes examples of the formal object   
 lessons given to the whole school     
 which then ranged from 5 - l5.

 were inspected regularly. The school  
 was closed on occasions when

 such as tea treats, to help on the    
 farm and for national celebrations.   </content>
