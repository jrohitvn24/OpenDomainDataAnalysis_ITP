		<content> The Twentieth Century has seen a      
 steady decline in the {Cotton         
{Industry,}but quite a lot still       
 remains. Other old industries still   
 survive, like {paper making and rope  
{making.}New industries such as{ light 
{engineering and small metal works}have
 come into the town. The most recent   
 growth area has been in the {storage  
{and warehousing industries.}The other 
 new development has been the {        
{Motorways. }The old transport systems 
 have gone, the canal has been filled  
 in, and the railway was closed in the 
 1960's. The new roads, the {M62 and   
{M66,}run very close to the town. Local
 Government reorganisation made the    
 town part of the Borough of Rochdale, 
 yet it still has links with Manchester
 and wishes to retain its  separate    
 identity. What follows are the views  
 of Heywood people about their town.   </content>
