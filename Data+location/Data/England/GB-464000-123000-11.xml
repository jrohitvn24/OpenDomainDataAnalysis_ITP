		<title>11RECREATION - CHILDREN</title>
		<content>   The playgroup meets three mornings a
 week in the Village Hall and about 19 
 3-4 year olds attend.                 
   There are no longer Brownie or Scout
 cub groups in the area, but a number  
 of children join the East Meon troops.
   The Sunday Club, meeting each week  
 for an hour at the Church seeks to    
 further understanding of religious    
 matters. 54 children belong, 35 attend
 regularly. On Sunday the group splits 
 into age-based groups for crafts,     
 teaching and discussions. The older   
 children help to teach the younger and
 have their own "Pathfinder" group     
 within the group. The leader is       
 concerned that the children live in an
 area with few amenities and the club  
 has monthly meetings for walks,       
 outings, theatre visits, barbeques,   
 treasure hunts etc. with the aim of   
 usefully occupying their spare time.  </content>
