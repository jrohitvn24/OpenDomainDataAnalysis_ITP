		<content> Transport in our area is mainly by    
{road}although some{river}and{rail     
 traffic pass  through.The rail line is
 the main Hull-Selby-Leeds line. The   
 road system includes: the main        
 road,the village roads,farm tracks,   
 and paths and bridleways.             
 The{main road}in our area is the{A63  
 trunk road from Leeds to Hull passing 
 through Selby and Howden.This road    
 carries a lot of traffic from West    
 Yorkshire to Hull docks.Latterly the  
 docks have declined and the extension 
 eastwards of the M62 has led to much  
 east-west heavy traffic using the     
 motorway.Thus our main road is now    
 relatively quiet.                     
 The majority of people living in the  
 area use private cars for             
 transport.However there is a local bus
 service which operates between the    
 villages and Selby each day.          </content>
