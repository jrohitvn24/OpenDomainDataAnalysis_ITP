		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE by Lee</title>
		<content>    On Monday I get up at about 6.00.  
 At about 7.15 I have my breakfast. I  
 pack my bag and go to school. I play  
 football until the bell goes, then we 
 line up to go in.                     
    In the classroom we do drawings and
 then we go in for Assembly, and       
 practice hymns. Then we go back to    
 class for lessons.                    
    At breaktime I play football and   
 after that it's more work like writing
 or maths.                             
    At 12.00 it's dinner time. I have a
 packed lunch but you can have a hot   
 dinner.                               
    After a bit more playtime we have  
 more work, perhaps painting or P.E.   
 Then I go home and play on my bike.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
