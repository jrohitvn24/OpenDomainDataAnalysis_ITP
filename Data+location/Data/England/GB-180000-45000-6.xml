		<content> The{Community of the Epiphany}is now  
 at Copeland Court, Kenwyn. It moved   
 from Tregolls Road about a year ago.  
 It is an{Anglican Order}dedicated to  
 the Epiphany, having 10 Sisters,      
 including the Reverend Mother. Their  
 ages range from 69-94 years. They have
 worked in other parishes, even as far 
 away as Japan. Their work here has    
 been in the caring for the elderly and
 still run the{Rosewin Home.}The       
 Sisters are under life vows of        
 poverty, chastity and obedience. Their
 habits are black. Regular services are
 held from early morning to about 8p.m.
{Quiet Day Retreats}are once a month.  
 The{Company of the Epiphany}recently  
 inaugurated, is a group of people in  
 everyday walk of life, working along  
 with the Sisters. The Company is an   
 extension of the Community.
