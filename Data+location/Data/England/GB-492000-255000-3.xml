 Harrold Green is a small area of grass
 in the centre of Harrold with three   
 buildings situated on it and many     
 beautiful old buildings surrounding   
 it.                                   
 The first old building is the Market  
 House, or Butter Market. It was built 
 by labourers employed by the Duke of  
 Kent between l7O2 and 1764. It was    
 used to sell cattle, butter and other 
 agricultural material.                
 Eight wooden pillars support an       
 octagonal tiled roof. There is an     
 octagonal bell housing on top of the  
 roof, with a weather vane on top of   
 that.                                 
 The second old building is the Cage or
 Lock-Up.This was built in 1824 and it 
 is a circular stone building four     
 square feet in area. The only window  
 is very small and is at least six feet</content>
