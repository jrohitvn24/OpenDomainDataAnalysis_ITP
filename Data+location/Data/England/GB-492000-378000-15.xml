		<title>15MANOR FARM BRATTLEBY CONT.</title>
		<content> The best barley goes to be made into  
 beer and the rest is used to feed the 
 animals.  The rape is used for cooking
 oil and margarine.  In the woods there
 are beech, oak and fir trees and and  
 there are a number of rabbits.        
   Mr. Marris has removed some hedges  
 but he does not like to because he    
 enjoys the birds and wild life that   
 nests in the hedges.  He found some   
 badgers sets and a conservation group 
 brought some badgers but they ran     
 away.                                 
    Mr. Marris poisons the rats        
 because they bring diseases to the    
 farm animals.  He also had ten ducks  
 but a fox killed eight of them and    
 only took one away to eat.  So Mr.    
 Marris has only two ducks now.
