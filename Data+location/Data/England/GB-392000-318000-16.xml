		<title>16A day in my life</title>
		<content>  I woke up at seven and had a shower. 
I had some cereal and a cup of tea.  I 
then packed my bags and went to school.
The first lesson was Maths and we did  
equations.  It was then time for SPICE 
which stands for Solving Problems in   
Community and Environment.  We learnt  
about the Domesday Project.  We went   
out of school to study some farmland.  
I went home for lunch.  After returning
I had English, we did an essay.        
Economics came next and we went over   
our trip to a supermarket, Asda.  At   
3.50 we went home.  I changed and did  
my homework.  Then I had tea and went  
out to play football.  After, I watched
television and played a computer game. 
I was tired, so I had a wash and went  
to bed.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
