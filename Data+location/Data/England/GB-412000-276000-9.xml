		<content>{Thomas Hawes of Shirley}bought a farm 
 in 1311. The farmhouse probably stood 
 within the confines of a moat but     
 nothing now remains of this building. 
 In 1576{William Hawes}built the       
 present{Hillfield Hall.}It was one of 
 the first all brick buildings in the  
 area. A serious fire  in the 18th.    
 century destroyed much of the rear of 
 the building. It is the oldest        
 building in the area and has recently 
 been redeveloped into a restaurant.   
     The stables of Hillfield Hall have
 been converted into a public house.   
 The stables are supposed to have their
 own ghost. The story is that a young  
 soldier went upstairs to the hay      
 store, pretending that he was getting 
 food for his horse and hung himself   
 from a beam.
