 alike.He starts his day by getting up 
 at about 7:00am(on Sunday,6:30am).He  
 then goes to the Church and prepares  
 for the service,which begins at 8:00am
 and lasts for about forty minutes     
 because there are no hymns and no     
 sermon.When everyone has left,he stays
 behind to prepare for the next service
 at 10:00am.This lasts a full seventy  
 minutes,and there are hymns and a     
 sermon.By the time everyone has left, 
 the time is about 11:30am.            
  From then on until lunch(1:30pm),he  
 may either,fill in different forms or 
 travel around his Parish talking to   
 and consoling people.From lunch until 
 the evensong service(6:00pm) he may be
{Baptising}someone(there are about     
 forty people per annum)or attending   
 the funeral of one of his
