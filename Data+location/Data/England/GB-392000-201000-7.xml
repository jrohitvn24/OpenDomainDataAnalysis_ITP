		<title>07  EVENTS IN SAPPERTON</title>
		<content>  On Saturday July 6th the parents of  
 our School organised a fete and a     
 barbecue to raise money so that we can
 go to the Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust   
 next Spring. There was something for  
 everybody. For the tinies Lady Denny  
 brought her donkeys for them to ride  
 on. Paddington Bear taught the bigger 
 ones songs. It was really a lady      
 dressed up as a bear. For the ones    
 older still there was an assault      
 course with a tank of water . For much
 older ones there were mini motor      
 bikes. All around the field there were
 stalls, skittles and darts and games  
 for everyone. My Mum sold icecreams.  
 We raised Â£160.17 and had a lovely    
 time.
