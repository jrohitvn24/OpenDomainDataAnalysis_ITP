 has two shifts 11.30am to 8.30pm and  
 5.30am till 2.00pm. My Dad's company  
 is putting the iron girders in. There 
 are about{800 people}working with him.
 My Dad broke his finger yesterday.    
 He has been working for about three   
 years at the pit. My Dad doesn't like 
 the pit because{wages}are only{Â£97}   
 instead of{Â£120.}My Dad would rather  
 be an{accountant.}

 about ten people. She works from
