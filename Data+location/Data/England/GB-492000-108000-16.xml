		<title>16Slindon Base Camp.</title>
		<content> The Base Camp at Slindon is a new     
 venture in the area, only recently    
 begun by the National Trust. Their    
 main object here is conservation, and 
 to this end, young volunteers come to 
 the camp for short periods and work   
 with trained National Trust Foresters 
 and other employees.                  
 They do conservation work for the     
 National Tust within the forested     
 areas, caring for new trees, planting 
 new trees and ensuring that the       
 wildlife,such as the herds of deer, is
 adequately protected. They work mainly
 under the guidance of Mr.John         
 Nazareth, amongst others.             
 Whilst they are at the camp,they live 
 in a converted stable block which has 
 all modern amenities.
