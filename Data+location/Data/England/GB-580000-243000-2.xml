		<content>   In 1086 the name was{Focsearde}.    
 Many variants like Foxherne and Fox-  
 holle occur in documents over the next
 few hundred years.  Perhaps it is nice
 and romantic to imagine the foxes'    
 burrowing places alongside the boars' 
 lea (Borley); but we think it was     
 really{Folksworth}and our forebears   
 were from across the North Sea.       
   Today, the population is 60% aliens 
 who have come (but not from Outer     
 Space) in the last twenty years. Among
 those who have lived here more than a 
 quarter century we only found six who 
 were born and bred in the village.    
 Similarly, young people nearly always 
 have to move away to find work and    
 houses they can afford. In 1966 (when 
 Mr. Finch became Headmaster) the      
 church Youth Club had thirty members; 
 now only four still live in the       
 village - two married couples.        </content>
