		<title>01Central Hartlepool Today</title>
		<content>      The centre of Hartlepool has     
 large areas of dereliction where once 
 the main hub of the town stood. It is 
 still the area regarded as the centre 
 of Hartlepool.  The railway station,  
 only bus station and a lot of the     
 towns administrative buildings can    
 still be found here.                  
      The dock area which once spawned 
 thriving ship building, heavy         
 manufacturing, and fishing industries,
 now bears the scars of those          
 prosperous times.  In their place are 
 car and pulp import, and scrap export 
 terminals.  What was once the 'Coal   
 Dock' now plays host to the rebuilding
 of H.M.S. Warrior.                    
      However, slowly the centre of the
 town is being rebuilt and a Hartlepool
 with a new and modern face is         
 emerging.  Hopefully it is a face with
 the smile of prosperity.              </content>
