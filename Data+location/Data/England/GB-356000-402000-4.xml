volunteer groups and opened in 1964. It
has 230 members all with a membership  
card. Youth members are 13-21, Junior  
members are under 13. Funds are raised 
mostly by volunteers plus a little help
from Wigan Metro. Qualified Leaders run
the many activities on offer eg. drama,
dancing, art competitions, community   
help, discussion groups, netball and   
football teams.  Jerrard's sister is in
the netball team.They just won a final.
Weekend trips and Exchange Groups are  
organised so are play schemes during   
the school holidays. Membership is open
to anyone but troublemakers are warned 
three times then banned. Parents are   
welcome too. The club which opens on   
Mondays and Fridays has 6 paid staff   
and 4 volunteers plus some Junior      
Leaders aged 18-25. It is a most       
valuable asset to our community.       </content>
