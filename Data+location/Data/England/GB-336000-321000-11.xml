 Ruyton Farmers co-operative was formed
 during the first part of world war 1  
 by a group of farmers in the area.They
 were directed by Mr W.H Gittins of    
 Hall Farm,Ruyton X1 Towns.The dairy   
 started at Hall Farm where they made  
 Cheshire cheese.  In l9l8 Hall Farm   
 became too small.They moved to where  
 the dairy now stands.In 1982 the most 
 modern continuous cheesemaking plant  
 was installed with a production       
 capacity at 730,000 litres of milk to 
 cheese daily.                         
 Milk is received at the dairy in bulk 
 farm tankers.There are about 482      
 producers supplying milk to the       
 factories on a daily basis to a       
 maximum intake of about 560,000 litres
 per day.Cheese from Ruyton is         
 automatically cut into blocks of      
 4.5 K.G and 2.3 K.G. blocks.          </content>
