		<title>07A Queen's Counsel</title>
		<content>   Mr. Anthony Purnell, who lives in   
 Ridgeway is a{Queen's Counsel}and must
 have been very excited when on the    
 Thursday before Easter 1984 he        
 received his letter of appointment.   
 There are only about 400 Q.C's in the 
 country. Mr. Purnell has{letters      
{patent}(a sort of licence): one an    
 enormous document with a red seal     
 appointing him Q.C.; the other signed 
 by the Queen{(Elizabeth II R)}showing 
 he is a{Recorder}- a kind of part-time
 judge - on at least 20 days a year.   
 When Mr. Purnell is a judge, people in
 court call him "Your Honour".         
   Mr. Purnell must dress properly in  
 court, with a small grey wig, a white 
 winged collar, a black waistcoat, a   
 black frock coat and a black gown.    
 While wearing these clothes, he       
 visited an infants' class and one     
 child shouted, "It's God!"            </content>
