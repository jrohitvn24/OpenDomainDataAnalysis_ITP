		<title>01TERLING VILLAGE REVIEW</title>
		<content> Terling is a picturesque village      
 situated 8 miles north of Chelmsford. 
 It has won the Best Kept Village award
 three times and has changed very      
 little in outward appearance over the 
 last hundred years or more. This is   
 thanks mainly to the fact that        
 virtually the whole of the village,   
 including the School and the Church   
 and many acres of land is owned by    
 Lord Rayleigh, who lives at Terling   
 Place, and is the figure_head of Lord 
 Rayleighs Farms Inc, who farm the land
 for miles around. They have a strong  
 influence on the Parish Council and   
 ensure that no new buildings are      
 erected without their consent.        
 Therefore the character of the village
 with its mainly timber framed houses, 
 some dating back to the 14th Century, 
 remains in tact,although there are    
 some Council and privately owned homes</content>
