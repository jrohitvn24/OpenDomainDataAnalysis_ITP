 about the farm and farming in the     
 area.He had lived in the area for 47  
 years.The farm was 300 years old.He   
 kept cattle,sheep,hens,and some pets. 
 He used modern machinery on his 200   
 acres.He grew four crops:corn;barley; 
 oats and wheat.He said that he kept   
 his cows for their meat.The oldest cow
 was 3 years old.The major change on   
 his farm over the years was discarding
 the horse for mechanisation.He owned 3
 barns.
