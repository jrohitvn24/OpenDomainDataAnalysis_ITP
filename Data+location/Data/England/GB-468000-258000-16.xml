  At the{Laurals,}Kislingbury people   
 have reported hearing strange and     
 weird noises.In the eighteenth        
 century,an old man stole some jewels  
 to support his wife and children.He   
 was caught in the act of hiding them, 
 and was stabbed many times in the     
 back.Shortly after, the {Laurals}was  
 built on the exact spot where he died.
   In the sixteenth century,{Quinton   
{House}was a fine majestic hall.In the 
 hall,there lived a beautiful woman.She
 had many suitors and made many people 
 jealous and unhappy.On  Saint         
 Valentines night at 11.30 pm,one of   
 her many suitors crept up to her room.
 There was a scuffle and the woman fell
 to her death.Every Valentines day  at 
 11.30 pm a pitiful screaming is heard.
