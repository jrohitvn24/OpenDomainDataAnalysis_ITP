		<title>14Sports in Radley</title>
		<content> here is a flourishing Boys' Football  
Club, run by volunteer managers and    
coaches. Matches are played on the     
pitch by the Village Hall, off Foxboro'
Rd. In 1984-5, the teams were arranged 
by age: Under 10, Under 11, Under 13,  
Under 16. These age groups move up     
each year. Apart from local league     
matches, a tour to Belgium is arranged 
for one or other of the teams, every 2 
or 3 years. In 1985 the Under 10's and 
the under 11's teams won the Oxford    
Supersports Cups, played on Oxford     
United and Oxford City grounds.        
A Radley CRICKET team plays Saturday   
and Sunday fixtures during the summer. 
During the Radley College holidays,    
all home matches are played on their   
2nd Xl pitch; before then all games are
played away from home. In recent years 
the Club has been very successful,     
losing very few games.                 </content>
