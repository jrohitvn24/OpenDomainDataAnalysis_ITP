		<content> Every Wednesday there is a scouts     
 meeting at the school.We start at 7.15
 and get into our groups before        
 breaking the flag.Then we play a game 
 of dodge ball.After this we do program
 work.This Wednesday we are            
 doing country codes like "shut gates  
 behind you".After programme work we   
 have a wide game.One patrol goes out  
 and another group has to find them.   
 The group that runs has to get back to
 the school and they have won.Then we  
 have flag down at 9 o'clock.Sometimes 
 we go to camp at Cosgrove.We go on    
 Friday and camp over night .In the    
 morning we go for a wash and then we  
 cook break fast.In the day we play    
 wide games and go for walks to the    
 shops. Sometimes we practice our axe  
 work.We go back on Sunday morning     
 after breakfast.
