		<title>05SURVEY CATERHAM VALLEY&amp;HILL</title>
		<content>    Caterham is often regarded as      
 two places, the valley and the hill.  
   In{BOTH AREAS}we found in most homes
 2 adults &amp; 2 children, popular pet was
 cats, shop locally weekly but go to   
 Croydon for larger items, used library
 extensively, used banks more than     
 building societies, used car for work,
 had a local doctor, had lived there   
 between 10 &amp; 20 years, go to church   
 occasionally. Almost everyone likes   
 living in Caterham and uses local     
 amenities with the same frequency.    
   In{CATERHAM VALLEY}houses mostly    
 detached, more children go to private 
 schools, are 2 car families, work     
 outside Caterham.                     
   On the{HILL}houses mostly semi-     
 detached, most children go to state   
 schools, 1 car families, work in      
 Caterham and use post office more     
 frequently.                           </content>
