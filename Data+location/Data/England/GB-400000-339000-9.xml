		<content>In Tean there are four denominational  
places of worship.Christ Church in     
Hollington Road is the C. of E. Church.
It was built of Hollington stone in    
1843 when Tean became a separate parish
from Checkley. Close by the Church is a
modern Church Hall and Vicarage.       
St Thomas of Canterbury is the R.C.    
Church. Built of brick in 1938 it is in
St Thomas' Road. Before the Church was 
built, the Old School by the side of   
the present Church was used for        
services.The Methodist Chapel is       
situated at the junction of Old Road   
and New Road.Although well supported,  
there is not a resident Minister. The  
Chapel is in need of repair because of 
damage caused by heavy traffic passing 
cose by.
