		<title>17Lydiard Millicent School</title>
		<content> The original school was built in{1840 
 and the tiny 7m by 5m room which is   
 now the library contained up to 40    
 children .  When in{1880}the extension
 to the red brick building which now   
 forms the classroom for the top class 
 was contructed,subscribers included   
 the Rev.Henry Hayward(Â£40) ,  Lord    
 Shaftesbury (4 guineas) and local     
 landowner James Sadler (5 guineas).   
 The{ghost of Miss Shaw}the            
 headmistress of 1880 is reputed to    
 haunt the old rooms !                 
 Now 4 full time teachers educate{113  
{pupils}in 5 classrooms . The school   
 has a large playground and sports     
 field where{athletics}and training for
 the successful{netball and football   
 teams takes place . The children think
 that their own hall would be useful as
 at the moment they have to use the    
 parish hall  "down the lane".         </content>
