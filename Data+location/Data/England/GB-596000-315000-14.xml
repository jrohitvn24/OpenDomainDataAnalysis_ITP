		<content> I live in the Old School at Beetley.  
 We came there because it was big to   
 work in.My Mum and Dad make leather   
 shoes. They have to stitch them and   
 stick soles on. We get the leather    
 from Start-rite in Norwich. We make   
 sandals, shoes and boots in lots of   
 colours. These are some of the colours
 we use, red, bright blue, pink,       
 orange, dark green, white, brown,     
 grey, black and turquoise. The boots  
 are mostly one colour, they have      
 little stripes where the laces are    
 that goes to the top and then all     
 around. My Mum usually takes the      
 finished articles to market, but at   
 the moment my Dad does because my Mum 
 has a sore knee. The market is in     
 London. It is called Covent Garden.
