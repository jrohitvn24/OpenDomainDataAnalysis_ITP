		<content> The early settlers in this area would 
 have used the River Coquet as their   
 main communication route,travelling on
 the river itself or along it's banks. 
 Today the area is covered by a network
 of narrow roads linking the farming   
 communities with nearby villages. The 
 absence of public transport means that
 almost every family is dependant on a 
 motorcar,the nearest bus routes being 
 up to three miles away.Members of the 
 public can use the school bus during  
 termtime,but the times are            
 inconvenient and the service is rarely
 used.                                 
 The London/Edinburgh railway passes   
 through the area and two              
 stations,Acklington and Alnmouth,are  
 easily accessible by car. This has led
 to several cottages being bought by   
 daily commuters to Newcastle upon     
 Tyne.                                 </content>
