		<title>07KIRBY GRANGE FARM</title>
		<content> This square kilometre is mostly       
 covered by the farm.We had a great    
 visit there the old lady was really   
 helpful.The farm was once a dairy farm
 with 40 acres but the M1 motorway was 
 built across alot of the land,only 14 
 acres remain.The farmhouse is 200     
 years old but the present owners came 
 20  years ago.They keep 6 livery      
 horses,5 calves and some chickens.They
 grow their own hay which is used as   
 winter feed for the animals.This means
 that they only need to buy pony cubes 
 ,calf nuts and dried dairy food in    
 small quantities.                     
 They sell some eggs and the calves    
 will be sold for beef in the end.Two  
 people work on the farm full time.    
 It was a very interesting place to    
 visit.
