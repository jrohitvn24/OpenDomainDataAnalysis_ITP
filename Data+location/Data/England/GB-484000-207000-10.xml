		<title>10Weekend At Home In Wendover</title>
		<content>                                       
My weekend starts on Friday night      
after homework, when I can sit and     
watch T.V until bedtime at 9.30pm.     
There's a mad rush on Saturday morning 
to have breakfast, get my football kit 
organised and be at football training  
on time - for 10am - which isn't very  
often. We usually practise skills and  
have a quick game. After lunch I play  
with friends in the park, ride my bike,
or go swimming in Aylesbury. Sometimes 
I read or watch T.V. Sundays are busy  
because I am a keen runner and we      
attend track meetings throughout       
England. I often win, but not always.  
 When we arrive home it's a long, hot  
bath for me - then dinner. We always   
have Sunday roast - lovely!            
Afterwards I check my homework until   
lights out at 9.00pm.
