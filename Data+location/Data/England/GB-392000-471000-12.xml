		<title>12EARLY SETTLEMENTS-ARNCLIFFE</title>
		<content>   The remains of an Iron Age          
 Settlement are situated on Blue Scar. 
 Compartments led off two main areas.  
 One is thought to have been a beehive 
 hut with two entrances.  The walls    
 were several feet thick.  Nearby are  
 several upright stones with holes in, 
 through which, it is said, the sun    
 shines on Midsummers Day.             
   Some of the lower fields in the     
 valley were cultivated by these Iron  
 Age people, their terraces, or        
 lynchets, still showing clearly.      
   Near Arncliffe, at a place called   
 Thornbottoms Barn, there are the      
 remains of a ringwork, similar to     
 those found in Wales.  Pottery,       
 charcoal, a knife and a coin from the 
 reign of Emperior Gordianus III (238  
 AD) were found, suggesting that the   
 site dates from Roman times, and      
 possibly earlier.                     </content>
