		<content>   One of the windows in the Norman    
 church at{Lyston}has medieval glass in
 the tracery with Our Lady holding orb 
 and lily{(lys)}so we do not approve of
 the modern spelling Liston.           
   Opposite the church is a row of four
 little cottages. Westwards is the     
 lodge at the gates of the Hall which  
 has all been pulled down except for   
 wings making 2 residual houses and a  
 small-holding. To the east are two    
 houses and the mill, timber-framed and
 weather-boarded, now a residence.     
 On the road to Borley there are three 
 large houses and a small pair semidet.
   About 1km upstream is another little
 settlement called Liston Gardens, just
 scattered pairs of houses near the    
 Bush Boake Allen{Factory.             
   That's all there is of Lyston!      
   Population 62.
