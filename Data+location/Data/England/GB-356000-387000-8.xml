		<title>08The Development of Old Hall</title>
		<content> It looked like the soldiers would stay
 for ever,but they did not.By 1950 most
 of the camps had disappeared and by   
 the middle of the 60's the aircraft   
 had gone as well.Peace and quiet      
 returned to the area,as it was left   
 forgotten and alone.some farming went 
 on ,but the land was scarred by the   
 concrete and iron left from the camps.
 By 1980 the population of Old Hall was
 practically nil with just a handful of
 people living in the nearby derelict  
 houses scattered around.Then once     
 again it all changed.More men and     
 machines arrived.This time to build   
 roads and houses,built by the New Town
 Development Corporation at            
 Warrington.Soon there was a           
 shop,school,community centre and      
 public telephone.Dozens of people were
 moving in every week.
