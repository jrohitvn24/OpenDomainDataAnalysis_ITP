		<content> The barracks and head quarters of the 
 army in the area are not in our       
 D-Block. We do have parts of two of   
 their main training areas in the      
 Block.                                
 In the East of the Block, we have an  
 area of scrub and swamp land which is 
 used as ranges for firing live        
 ammunition. There are two rifle ranges
 and a pistol range. Years ago,when    
 this was the centre for army railways,
 the main track went across this land. 
 The other area is the Hogmoor         
 Inclosure. This is where the army     
 carries out driver training in tracked
 vehicles. They also carry out driver  
 training in all sizes and types of    
 vehicle on the main roads.
