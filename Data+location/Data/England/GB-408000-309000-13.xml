		<title>13 Dr Samuel Johnson</title>
		<content>In the market square there is a statue 
of Dr Johnson to commemorate the       
anniversary of his death in 1784. On   
one side it has inscribed the words    
"Every man has a lurking wish to appear
considerable in his native place."     
   He was born in Lichfield in 1709 and
his birthplace overlooks the market    
square where his statue stands.        
   In the house, now a museum, there is
a collection of objects, clocks, china,
paintings and other items of interest, 
belonging to the time when Dr Johnson  
lived there. Many books belonging to Dr
Johnson are to be found in two         
libraries within the house.
