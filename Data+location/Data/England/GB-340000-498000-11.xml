		<title>11Tourism - Accomodation (B&amp;B)</title>
		<content> Bed and breakfast accomodation is a   
 readily available. Many people        
 supplement their normal income by     
 opening their houses to the B&amp;B trade.
 During the main holiday season        
 (Whitsun to early September), many    
 houses all over the area will be seen 
 displaying a B&amp;B sign. Prices will    
 vary greatly according to the         
 facilities available, such as shower  
 with the room, colour tv., etc. A     
 typical basic price would be Â£8 per   
 night, but it can go up to Â£12. Most  
 people who stay in B&amp;B come in their  
 own cars and intend to go sight seeing
 or walking in the area. The average   
 stay is only one night.               
 There has been a corresponding growth 
 in the number of restaurants offering 
 lunches and evening meals for those in
 B&amp;B accomodation.
