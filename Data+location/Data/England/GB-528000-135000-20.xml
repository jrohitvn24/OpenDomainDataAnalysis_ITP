		<content> We went down the road and we saw some 
 breeze blocks and they came in 4      
 different sizes, 50 75 100 150. Then  
 we saw some foundations with water    
 inside and out. Later they'll fill    
 them in with 6-8 metres of concrete.  
 Then we saw a man who was going to put
 some tiles on the roof. Next we went  
 into a house which wasn't anywhere    
 near built. We went up some stairs and
 there was a man with a chain saw. The 
 men showed us how the floorboards fit 
 together. It was a bit like a jig-saw.
 In the next house there was a man     
 working on the ceiling with Artex and 
 he was doing a pattern called Broken  
 Leather. Then we saw a forklift truck 
 which lifted some breeze blocks as    
 high as the chimney. In the next house
 it was nearly finished and everything 
 was fitted. Tina Singh Age 8
