		<content>{INTRODUCTION}- The village of Hinton  
 on Green was bought by William Laslett
 in 1882 to help the poor and needy    
 people.He was the M.P. for            
 Worcestershire.This policy was        
 not to sell any of the houses or land.
 But in the early 1970's he sold land  
 to the Parish Council to provide      
 council houses and O.A.P. bungalows   
 who later sold land to private buyers.
 The corn mill was sold to the tennant 
 as he would not improve the property  
 unless he owned it. It is now a home.
