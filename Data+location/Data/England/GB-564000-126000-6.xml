		<content> Stonegate Youth Club meets once a week
 in Stonegate Village Hall.As there are
 many members and a large range of ages
 the club is divided into senior and   
 junior sections.The juniors take part 
 in organised games and activities,such
 as stoolball,snooker,darts,cricket,   
 unihoc and treasure hunts.The seniors 
 prefer to organise their own          
 activities,or listen to records or    
 tapes.For all members the 'disco' is  
 one of the most popular pastimes.The  
 members run their own disco evenings  
 using the club's own equipment.As well
 as using the Village Hall the members 
 travel further afield seeking other   
 entertainments and activities,such as 
 ice skating,ski-ing on an artificial  
 ski slope,swimming,rock climbing,     
 hiking and visiting amusement parks.
