		<content>{Â£Kerby'}                              
Another favourite street game is called
Kerby which is played by two people.The
only equipment needed is a football.One
person stands on one side of the road &amp;
the other on the opposite side.The idea
of the game is to throw the ball       
across the road &amp; hit the kerb so that 
the ball bounces back to you.If you    
bounce the ball &amp; it comes back to you 
you get one point.You keep doing this  
until one person gets three points &amp; he
or she is the winner.                  
{Â£Please Mr. Crocodile'}One person is  
on &amp; she calls a colour or an          
object.If any of the players has a     
colour or the object she can walk      
across to the other side but the ones  
who havn't got it on have to get       
across without being touched by the    
caller.The game carries on like this   
until everyone is caught.              </content>
