		<content> WHEN THE TOWN WAS FIRST BUILT, THE    
 FAMILIES THAT MOVED HERE CAME FROM    
 ARES WHERE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH       
 HOUSES. MANY FAMILIES ORIGINALLY CAME 
 FROM LONDON, AND THE FOOTBALL TEAM    
 THAT THE FATHERS SUPPORTED OFTEN      
 REPRESENTED WHERE THEY ORIGINALLY CAME
 FROM. THE FAMILES USUALLY HAD FOUR OF 
 MORE CHILDREN AND THIS IS THE REASON  
 WHY THEY NEEDED RE-HOUSING. SO, THERE 
 WERE FAR TOO MANY YOUNG CHILDREN IN   
 BASILDON AND THEY BECAME A NUISANCE,  
 ROAMING AROUNFD THE TOWN CENTRE AT    
 NIGHT AND MAKING A NUISANCE OF        
 THEMSELVES. NOW MOST OF THEN HAVE     
 GROWN UP, AND MARRIED AND NOW LIVE IN 
 A HOUSE IN BASILDON OF THEIR OWN. A   
 FEW YEARS AGO, THE CORPORATION OFFERED
 ALL THE RENTED HOUSE FOR SALE, AND    
 ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TENANTS BOUGHT   
 THEM. MANY OF THESE HAVE NOW MOVED OUT
 OF BASILDON.                          </content>
