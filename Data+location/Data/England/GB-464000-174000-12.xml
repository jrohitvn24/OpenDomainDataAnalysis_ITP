		<content> Different colours have been used for  
 the bricks of the buildings helping to
 add variety.                          
 Some of the houses have no chimneys,  
 being built purposely for central     
 heating.The new housing in Tilehurst  
 area follows the modern trend of being
 built in small cul_de_sacs,each       
 leading from a larger distribution    
 road.The distribution road has few if 
 any houses on it.Clusters of garage   
 complexes help to serve the small     
 terraces,whilst the Detatched and     
  emi_Detatched houses each have their 
 own garages.                          
  Small green areas are interspersed   
 amongst the cul_de_sacs as safe places
 in which children can play.
