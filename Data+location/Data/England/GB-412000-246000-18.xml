		<content> There are 3 public houses. Pebworth's 
 Mason's Arms, has a comfortable lounge
 and public bar, juke box, fruit       
 machine, darts, dominoes and quiz     
 teams. Cold food is served. Long      
 Marston's Mason's Arms, attracts      
 younger custom. 2 linked rooms house a
 piano and fruit machine. There are    
 darts, quiz and air gun teams and a   
 popular skittle alley. Hot food is    
 served. The unique quality of Broad   
 Marston's Shoulder of Mutton has been 
 retained by one family for 3          
 generations. Small, thatched, with no 
 spirits licence or bar, customers are 
 served through a hatch. The elderly   
 owners use their sitting room as a    
 "snug". The public house remains      
 important to rural life providing a   
 meeting place for all sections of the 
 village.
