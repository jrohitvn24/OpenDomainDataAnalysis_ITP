		<content>  When we went for a walk we went to   
{Stanfree}with our teachers Mrs Mellor 
 and Mrs Chapman.  We walked through a 
 muddy bit of land which horses had    
 been on.  We looked at our maps and   
 saw that we were at{Romley Farm.      
                                       
                                       
{ Romley Hall}was in ruins but on our  
 map we saw that there was a foot path 
 leading right up to it.  We asked a   
 man if we could go up to the ruins of 
 the Hall which was through the Farm   
 yard, but he said no.                 
                                       
 On our walk we also saw a man putting 
 a few cows in a field so they could   
 eat the grass.  He had a lovely puppy 
 with him that was black and white.
