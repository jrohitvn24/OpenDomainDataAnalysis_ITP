 Durham City lies Weardale. It extends 
 from Wolsingham in the west to        
 Cowshill in the east, from Stanhope in
 the south to{Rookhope}in the north.   
      Rookhope is a quiet village      
 three miles north of Eastgate and the 
 A689 Trunk Road from Durham to        
 Penrith.                              
      Approximately three hundred      
 people live in the village and its    
 outlying farms. There is a general    
 store and a Post Office in the centre 
 of the village; together with the     
 local Primary School, the Rookhope    
 Inn, the Workingmen's Club and a      
 well-established Nursery Garden. The
