		<title>18ST. NICHOLAS CHURCH PLUCKLEY</title>
		<content> Pluckley was recorded in the Domesday 
 book of 1086 as Pluchlei. The parish  
 includes the now extinct one of       
 Pevington and the hamlets of Ford Mill
 and Rooting Street. 1093 is the first 
 recorded appointment of a rector at   
 St. Nicholas, Pluckley. Though the    
 present 13th century church is built  
 on the site of former ones.           
  The north wall of the church is  all 
 that remains of the Norman church. At 
 the junction of the nave and the      
 chapel is a low stopped window which  
 was known as a Leper's window. Much   
 restoration took place in 1852 when 6 
 bells were recast for the belfry. The 
 church suffered bomb damage during the
 second world war when a V1 Flying Bomb
 landed nearby. A modern north window  
 depicting the annunciation, replaced  
 the original.                         
                                       </content>
