		<content>     The biggest employer in Clay Cross
 is{Clay Cross Works.}The factory      
 spreads over 45 acres and {employs 500
{people.}Each employee works 46 hours a
 week.                                 
    The factory was built in{1837}by   
{George Stephenson}who also built the  
 "Clay Cross Tunnel". George Stephenson
 was given a contract for a railway    
 line to be put down between Leeds and 
 Derby.While he was digging the "Clay  
 Cross Tunnel" he noticed all the{coal 
{and minerals}in the ground so he      
 bought much of the land round Clay    
 Cross. The works make{ductile pipes,  
{fittings}and{engineering castings     
 mainly for the{Clean Water Authorities
 to supply houses with fresh water.    
    Only 1% or 2% of the products is   
 exported - mainly to Spain and Italy. 
 Not much is exported because the pipes
 are too bulky to transport far.       </content>
