          {Diet,Contraception_Unmarried
{                       Mothers}       
  In diet matters at last there seems  
 to be some sign of an awakening to the
 fact of life_perhaps the day of the   
 'fat boy' are at last numbered.       
  In contraception here there have been
 great advances,with legalised abortion
 as a last resort.One can say unwanted 
 babies are now the result of          
 stupidity,because the knowlage is     
 there in the asking in all sorts of   
 media.I would wish however that the   
 profession of unmarried mothers were  
 not so popular among the young.It     
 appears to be regarded as both        
 respectable and desirable.
