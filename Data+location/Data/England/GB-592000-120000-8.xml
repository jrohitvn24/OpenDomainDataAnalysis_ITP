		<title>08The Fishing Fleet at Rye</title>
		<content>  Rye is situated by the river Rother  
 and was once an island. It is 2\ miles
 from the coast and the river is tidal.
 In Rye the boats are mostly trawlers  
 and small gill net boats. They vary in
 size from 5 to 18 metres and there are
 roughly 30 of them.                   
  They catch many different species of 
 fish. The bulk of them are plaice and 
 whiting. These fish and others are    
 sold in the fish market where the     
 boats are moored up. The fishermen    
 drop their nets between 1/4 mile and  
 12 miles offshore and the depth that  
 thay drop their nets again varies from
 5 t 60 metres. A Rye fisherman goes   
 out to fish day or night depending on 
 the weather. Most fishermen live in   
 Rye or in surrounding villages. The   
 registration is RY for Rye.
