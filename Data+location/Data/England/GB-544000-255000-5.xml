		<title>05Hobson's Conduit</title>
		<content>    Thomas Hobson was a 17th century   
 gentleman who ran a horse service     
 between Cambridge and London for a    
 living. If you hired one of his horses
 you would not have a choice but had to
 take the next one that was ready-hence
 the saying 'Hobson's Choice'- meaning 
 none!  A notice by the front of the   
 Conduit in Lensfield Rd reads "This   
 structure stood upon the market hill  
 and served as a conduit from 1614 to  
 1856 in which year it was erected on  
 this spot by public subscription." It 
 also tells that the water comes from  
 Great Shelford. On the back it reads  
 "Thomas Hobson, carrier between       
 Cambridge and London and a great ben- 
 efactor to his town. Died 1st day of  
 January in the 86th year of his age". 
   He founded almshouses and gave money
 to educate poor children as well as   
 giving Cambridge a good water supply. </content>
