		<content>{TRANSPORT}-The motorway runs from     
 North to South in the Western region  
 of the area.The motorway island has   
 five major turnings off it.Most of the
 roads in the area are B roads apart   
 from the motorway.The canal runs      
 around the North Western area.The     
 railway runs almost parallel with the 
 motorway on the Eastern side.         
{LANDSCAPE}-It is rural landscape,     
 scattered with farms and one village  
 of about 700 people.The land is       
 rolling,but there is a steep wooded   
 ridge running from North to South in  
 the West of the area.This reaches     
 79-80m .There seems to have been very 
 little building in the area.          
{AGRICULTURE}-The land is used for     
 dairy pasture and cereals, with some  
 sheep. Most the land was green because
 of growing and ripening crops.
