		<content>  To play skipping you need a rope and 
 three people. Two people hold the rope
 one at each end,and they turn the     
 rope.The third person has to skip.Here
 is a rhyme we say."{Blue,Bells Cockle 
{Shells  Evee Ivy Over}".              
 We play{Ker plunk.You}have a plastic  
 tube with holes on a base with        
 different sections.Before you play,   
 put plastic sticks through one hole   
 and out another.When they are in you  
 put marbles in a hole in the top. You 
 choose a number and pull a stick      
 without dislodging the marbles.{Crazy 
{Cricket}a game invented by boys in    
 Treloweth School,is played with two   
 batsmen and fielders.The object is to 
 be in bat as often as possible.If you 
 are fielding you catch the ball to go 
 in bat. We use a tennis ball for it is
 easy to catch.The batsmen have to hit 
 the ball high or he is out.           </content>
