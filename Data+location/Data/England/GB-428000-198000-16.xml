 No new house construction is allowed  
in this area. One new bungalow was     
built last year, only possible because 
it replaced a prefabricated dwelling.  
 The 7 farmhouses are all very old     
Cotswold stone buildings. 8 farm       
cottages are still in use by farmers'  
families or by farm workers, but there 
are 4 that are empty, becoming         
derelict. 3 separate pairs of cottages 
have been sold and converted into      
detatched houses, in 2 cases these are 
just weekend homes. It is assumed this 
will happen to those empty at present. 
 There are only 4 other properties; an 
old cottage by the bridges, the Swan   
Inn,the Lock-keepers house and the old 
manor. Radcot House is a beautiful old 
Elizabethan building with attractive   
gables.  One Cotswold stone barn is at 
present undergoing conversion.         </content>
