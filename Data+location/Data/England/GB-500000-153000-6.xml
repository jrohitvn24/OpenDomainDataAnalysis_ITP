		<title>06TRAFFIC SURVEY IN SEND</title>
		<content> The junction of the A247/B318 at Mays 
 Corner, inside the 30mph limit, is    
 heavily used by children of all ages. 
 There is one school crossing patrol.  
 The heavy traffic on the main road is 
 increased by parents collecting and   
 dropping schoolchildren, by school    
 coaches and by lorries turning into   
 the B318 to a nearby sand pit depot.  
 This junction is close to St. Bede's  
 Middle School, whose pupils conducted 
 a traffic census on 2 weekdays in 1984
 between 8.30-9.00 and 15.15-15.45, 5  
 years after their previous survey. The
 figures showed the number of vehicles 
 in the morning session is similar in  
 1984 to 1979, ie.total of 800+ in 30  
 minutes, near optimum number for the  
 crossing. The afternoon figures showed
 a 20% increase. The main traffic flow 
 had slightly increased in favour of   
 the Woking direction.                 </content>
