		<title>02VIEWS ABOUT BLACK TORRINGTON</title>
		<content> Black Torrington has seen vast social 
 and economic changes over the years.  
 Mechanisation of farms has almost     
 eliminated farm workers and, with the 
 trend to smaller families,has caused a
 sharp decline in the population,      
 especially among young people. The    
 school is one third of its former size
 and may eventually close. The main    
 street is little changed but most old 
 houses are modernised. Dramatic wage  
 increases and modern facilities have  
 led to a vastly higher standard of    
 living, but the butcher, cobbler,baker
 blacksmith,tailor,dentist,wheelwright,
 one inn,one grocer and the local      
 policeman have disappeared. Most      
 villagers are satisfied with existing 
 amenities, though some advocate more  
 street lights, buses and facilities   
 for the young.They felt that remaining
 businesses would probably survive.    </content>
