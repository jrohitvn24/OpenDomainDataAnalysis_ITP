		<content>SHIRBURN CASTLE - the castle is thought
to have been built in 1377 ,although   
some claim that it dates back to Norman
times. It is made of 7 different types 
of brick, the oldest being local chalk.
It still has a working drawbridge and a
moat fed by an underground stream      
from the Chilterns.                    
In the Victorian times Lady            
Macclesfield used to apprentice all the
children in the area and give them a   
trade either in  the onsite laundry,   
bakery,smithy, carpenter's workshop,   
stableyard, garden, brewery, dairy or  
as  one of the many servants in the    
house. The castle has about 47 rooms.  
It is still lived in by the            
Macclesfields. There is also a private 
church and cemetary.
