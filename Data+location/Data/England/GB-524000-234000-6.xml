		<title>06Housing N.E. of Baldock</title>
		<content>  Housing outside Baldock consists of  
 two basic types:                      
     (a) farms and farmworkers' houses.
     (b) commuter 20th century housing.
                                       
  The farms vary. Bygrave has the Manor
 House, complete with moat, whereas    
 along the Bygrave road, just outside  
 Baldock there is a line of isolated   
 houses which were originally          
 smallholdings.                        
                                       
  The hamlet of Bygrave also has a row 
 of similar houses which were the      
 workers' houses for the Manor estate. 
                                       
  The rest of Bygrave consists of      
 commuter housing, with a strange      
 section of commuter housing           
 separated by about 1 km. from the     
 hamlet proper.
