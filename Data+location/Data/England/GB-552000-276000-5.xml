		<content> The main agricultural practice of the 
 area is based on{arable farming}. The 
 main crops are wheat, barley, sugar   
 beet and potatoes. Other common crops 
 include oil seed rape, onions, celery 
 and carrots. The farming is very      
 intensive with a high degree of       
 investment especially in machinery.   
 Specialist pieces of equipment such as
 sugar beet harvestors and drills have 
 been designed in the locality for use 
 on the land. High yields are obtained 
 by the extensive use of fertlisers,   
 pesticides and irrigation. The last of
 these is becoming more and more       
 important as farmers try to maximise  
 their yields and grow their crops     
 under optimal conditions. Higher      
 yields associated with high quality   
 will ensure a goor return for the     
 farmer. Some rough grazing of cattle  
 takes place on the river banks/washes.</content>
