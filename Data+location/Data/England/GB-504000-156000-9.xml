		<content> This has, until recently, been an     
 entirely agricultural area and some   
 residents are still employed on farms 
 here or nearby. But, the coming of the
 railways and, later, of trunk roads   
 such as A3 and M25, has led to an     
 almost overwhelming influx of         
 commuters. They travel to London, to  
 Heathrow Airport, to Woking or to     
 aircraft works in Weybridge or as     
 salesmen all over the country. The 25 
 shops in Ripley include several       
 selling antiques, for which the place 
 is noted. There is also a hairdresser,
 an estate agent and the garages and   
 pubs etc listed in the Amenity Count.
