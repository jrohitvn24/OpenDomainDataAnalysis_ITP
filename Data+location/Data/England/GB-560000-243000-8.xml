		<title>08Castle Camps Primary school.</title>
		<content> Our school was built about 120 years  
 ago, with some rooms built about 25   
 years ago.There are 86 children in    
 school at present.We have a heated    
 swimming pool and a playing field.We  
 also have some playing apparatus. The 
 old school house has just been bought.
 The school has just got two mobile    
 classrooms, because the school has    
 become very crowded. Children from    
 Horseheath now attend, as the school  
 there closed last year. The school    
 Hall will now not house a class, as it
 has always done in the past. This term
 there have been two classes in the    
 Hall! There are four teachers,        
 including the Head,Mr.Scull. A        
 secretary and two General assistants  
 complete the staff. There is lots of  
 equipment in school, including two    
 computers.It is a happy place.
