		<content> The main method of transport available
 is the private motor car. Most people 
 in Upper Heyford village have access  
 to a car.Several families have two or 
 more cars.The USAF families living on 
 the base also have private cars.      
                                       
 There are two daily buses which serve 
 the area. One of these runs to Banbury
 and one to Bicester.They are not very 
 frequent and are used mainly for the  
 occasional shopping trip.             
                                       
 Trains to Oxford Banbury and London   
 can be caught at Lower Heyford station
 about one mile away.
