<title>21Old Habits</title>
<content>

Wow!  How exciting my Saturdays must have been back then!  I've often wondered what happened to all the work we did for this - we seemed to spend weeks on in, interviewing people and writing about the local area.  Then we heard nothing more about it!&lt;br />&lt;br />It must have been 1985 when we did all this though, not 1986, as we all went to the high school in 1985, and  remember we walked around Hemsworth in some really hot weather!  Our group was walking with Laura Curran (Zoe's Mum) and she bought us all an ice pop on the way back to school as we'd all be so good for her!  Think it was just because she wanted one too it was so hot!&lt;br />&lt;br />My Saturdays still include music school, as my daughter now goes there.  Oh yeah, they involve fish and chips too - what can I say?  Old habits die hard!&lt;br />&lt;br />Sharon&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
