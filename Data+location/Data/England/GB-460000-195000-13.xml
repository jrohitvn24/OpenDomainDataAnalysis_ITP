 Our conductor is Anthony Spicer.The   
oldest player is Syd. Spicer, he is 75 
the youngest is 9; we have many young  
players, almost half the band.         
 Sometimes we play in contests where   
we can choose our pieces, sometimes we 
have to play a set programme. We are   
not very successful in competitions.   
 We play at local fetes for which the  
band is paid 50 pounds.                
  We go on tour at Easter to Belgium,  
it is great.
