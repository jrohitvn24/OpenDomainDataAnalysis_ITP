		<title>01Introduction to the Area</title>
		<content> The area is rural with gently rolling 
 fields, and about 200 feet above sea  
 level. {The River Wensum}flows through
 the area with lush green grassland on 
 either side.                          
 A small part of the village of{Great  
{Ryburgh}occupies the south west corner
 of the area.  The village of{Stibbard 
 is central - a thriving, lively       
 community with a population of about  
 400. It centres around{The Pound}- a  
 small green with a magnificent beech  
 tree circled in metal with a wooden   
 seat around it.  Nearby is the{Post   
{Office Stores}and the fifty year old  
{Village Hall}which is the focus of    
 many village activities.              
 Most people from the area work within 
 a few miles of home. Agriculture is   
 very intensive, using large amounts of
 machinery but few workers.
