{11                                    
   At 7.00a.m.I get up and get ready   
 for school and have my breakfast.     
 Then I cycle to the bus-stop to catch 
 the school bus at 8.00.               
   We start school at 9.00.  This      
 morning I had a Maths lesson until    
 break and then an English lesson from 
 break until lunchtime.  I ate my lunch
 at school as it would take too long to
 go home for lunch.  After lunch I had 
 Science and then an art lesson.       
   We finished school at 3.30 and after
 a ride in the school bus I collected  
 my bike and cycled home.  When I got  
 home I did my homework and watched    
 T.V., had my tea and I went out to    
 play at 6.00p.m..I always play out if 
 it is fine until about 7.00p.m.  I go 
 to bed at 8.00 p.m.
