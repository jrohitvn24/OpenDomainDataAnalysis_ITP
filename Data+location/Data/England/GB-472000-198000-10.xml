		<content>Stanley Rowe was ordained by the Bishop
of Chelmsford in 1950. He worked as a  
curate,vicar and teacher both in       
Nigeria and in England before retiring 
and then becoming priest-in-charge at  
Aston Rowant in 1983. He enjoys working
in the Church because he likes helping 
people.                                
Rev. Rowe looks after Crowell Parish   
Church as well. He conducts services   
every Sunday in Aston Rowant and three 
Sundays a month in Crowell.            
Of his work Rev. Rowe says that running
a church is like running a business; he
visits the sick,discusses christenings,
weddings and funeral arrangements with 
his parishioners,participates in the   
organisation of the Youth Club and     
attends many different kinds of        
meetings on Church business, for the   
school and for the community.
