		<title>02WITTON PARK - PAST &amp; PEOPLE</title>
		<content> Many of the residents of Witton Park  
 have lived from thirty to fifty years 
 in the village and express regret at  
 the way it has been run down.  Many   
 people have moved to Bishop Auckland, 
 but the residents who remain value the
 fresh air and scenery.  The people    
 expressed a wish to restore the       
 village rather than see it disappear  
 and stress the need for more new      
 houses and improvements to property an
 roads.  The annual carnival is well   
 supported and many "exiles" and       
 relatives return for this colourful   
 event.  Conversation turns to the old 
 picture house, Quadrini's ice cream   
 shop, long gone streets (King St.,    
 Albion St., Thompson St.), the Station
 and the Iron Works.  We witnessed the 
 demolition of the Salvation Army hall!
