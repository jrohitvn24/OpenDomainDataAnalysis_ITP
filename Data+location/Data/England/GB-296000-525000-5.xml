		<title>05TRACK MAKING AT WORKINGTON</title>
		<content>{The British Steel Corporation}at      
 Workington reheats{blooms(Steel       
{sections)}and rolls them into a       
 finished product.Blooms are           
{transported by rail from Teeside to   
{Workington.}The cold blooms are placed
 in reheating furnaces which are heated
 by natural gas,the temperature of the 
 blooms is raised to approximately     
{white heat}which is over 1000C.At this
 temperature it is both malleable and  
 ductile and ready for a{rolling       
 process in No.1 mill.The blooms are   
 now{cogged}down into a smaller bloom  
 section and then sheared(cut)into     
 lengths for further processing.The    
 steel is then passed through{roughing 
 and{finishing rolls}where it is rolled
 into 120 feet,113 pounds per yard     
 steel rails.The rough ends are cut off
 with a saw while hot.After cooling the
 rails are{straightened}ready for sale.</content>
