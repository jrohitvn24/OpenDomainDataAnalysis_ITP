		<content> Park Wood Farm (803032) is an isolated
 farmhouse which forms part of Launde  
 Estate. Until 1979 there were no      
 amenities but since then improvements 
 have included a septic tank, the      
 building of a road to the house, the  
 pumping and piping of water to the    
 house from a spring 40 yds away and   
 the installation of electricity       
 brought in from Copt Hill Farm.       
 The farm is half a mile from the      
 Launde to Loddington road. The village
 of Belton is about two miles away by  
 footpath and has reasonable amenities.
 The dustman doesn't call but the      
 milkman would if wanted. Mail is left 
 in a box halfway between the farm and 
 the road. Children go to Loddington to
 catch a bus to Tugby School and a     
 petrol allowance is paid for this. The
 Launde _ Loddington boundary passes   
 through the house.                    </content>
