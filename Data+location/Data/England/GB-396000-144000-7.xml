		<content> Stables to train race horses have been
 established in Chitterne for over one 
 hundred years and run as a commercial 
 enterprise for over thirty years.     
 There are facilities for twenty four  
 horses.  The only shop left in the    
 village is a general store supplying  
 everyday needs, daily papers and      
 "local gossip" to the villagers; it   
 also incorporates the sub-Post Office 
 which moved in from other premises    
 some years ago.  A Warminster based   
 milkman delivers milk, bread and dairy
 produce five times a week.  In 1984 a 
 resident started a metal workshop for 
 welding, fabrications and repairs for 
 home, farm, garden and industry.  A   
 large house takes a limited number of 
 paying guests for bed and breakfast.
