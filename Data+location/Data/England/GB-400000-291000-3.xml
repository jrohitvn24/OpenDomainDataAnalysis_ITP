		<title>03M5 M6 Interchange West Brom</title>
		<content> When the M5&amp;M6 interchange was planned
 the route chosen was one which ran    
 along the wide  flat valley of the    
 River Tame. It had no large           
 housing estate or built up area but   
 was mostly occupied by smallfarms such
 as Wigmore Farm and waste land .The   
 land in this area belonged mostly to  
 West Bromwich Corporation. This land  
 of the Tame Valley was obviously      
 favoured as a routeway in the 19th    
 century as both the railway and canal 
 are built along the valley.The Grand  
 Junction railway line runs through the
 north of our block along the Tame     
 Valley to Birmingham following roughly
 the line of the river and the Tame    
 Valley Canal. The M5 passes under the 
 A4041(Newton Road) from there the M5  
 and the link road are built on        
 embankments and concrete pillars at   
 varied levels along the Tame Valley.  </content>
