		<content>  As stated in the introduction,most   
 people are employed on the land and,  
 of the working population totalling   
 109 in the two villages,46 people     
 travel elsewhere to work.             
 The table below shows the distances   
 involved and the number of people who 
 travel them:                          
  {Distance to Work     No. of people. 
       Up to 3 miles           14

       Over 20   "              5      
  The question of employment is a very 
 delicate one because in recent years  
 there has been an enormous increase in
 unemployment not only in this country 
 but in Europe and America because of  
 a recession.                          
  Increased mechanization in farming   
 has affected the two villages and     
 small farms are a thing of the past.  </content>
