		<title>14BRAYDON FARMING GENERAL</title>
		<content>    The land is very heavy clay and so 
 difficult to work. In farming language
 it is "man's land" and not "boys      
 land". This factor keeps farms small. 
 Dairy farms are approx 50-100 acres.  
 The land type makes it impossible to  
 stock these farms intensively as the  
 ground gets so boggy in winter and    
 grass is slow to grow in spring due to
 the cold and wet.                     
    Most farms are family concerns with
 very little outside labour. Contract- 
 ors may be brought in for hay/silage  
 making and hedgecutting.              
    The straw has to be bought-in from 
 surrounding arable areas. Farmers     
 often buy it off the field, baling and
 carting it home themselves.           
    There are some wealthy landowners  
 with outside business interests and   
 they will employ managers to run the  
 farm.                                 </content>
