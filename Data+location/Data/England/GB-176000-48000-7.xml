		<title>07FARM ACCOMMODATION, ALLET.</title>
		<content> Mr.&amp; Mrs.G's farmhouse has required   
 major repairs,&amp; a large extension was 
 built, originally to house the aunt &amp; 
 mother of Mrs.G..  6 rooms are now    
 available for bed &amp; breakfast tourists
 &amp; the farm is registered to take up to
 5 non-permanent caravans. None of this
 is advertised but is popular by       
 recommendation &amp; is available &amp; used  
 all the year round. Mrs.G. has no help
 &amp; as well as working on the farm,bakes
 bread &amp; makes wine.She still cares for
 her aunt &amp; visits her mother in Truro.
 Plans to extend the tourist           
 accommodation by converting unused    
 buildings have been rejected by the   
 local authority, as have plans for a  
 large caravan site, although it is    
 hoped that a few more caravans will   
 soon be allowed under recent E.E.C.   
 regulations.
