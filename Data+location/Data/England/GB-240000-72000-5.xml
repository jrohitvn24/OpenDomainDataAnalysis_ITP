		<content> In our area in the last few years     
 there have been many changes.In 1963  
 the railway service through our survey
 area was withdrawn. Although road     
 surfaces have improved, the{bus       
{service}has practically vanished. Many
 older people said that modernisation  
 as such had only affected the area    
 comparatively recently. There has also
 been a great{increase in the number of
{houses}and the{influx of people moving
{into the area}has meant that village  
 life is busier than before.More houses
 now have garages built during the     
 last few years to accommodate the     
 growing number of{vehicles necessary  
{for transport.}The increase in        
 population had, in some people's      
 opinion, kept the village alive       
 although most work outside the area.
