		<title>04Church Army - Captain Rouse</title>
		<content> Captain Rouse is one of the best known
 characters in Darfield. He belongs to 
 the Church Army and has been a member 
 for 7 years. His mission is going     
 round Darfield visiting people with   
 problems, especially old people. He   
 likes to walk on his rounds but also  
 uses a bicycle. Only when it rains    
 does he use his car, so he is very    
 fit.                                  
   He is an interesting man to talk to 
 and enjoys meeting people but he feels
 quite sad when he visits people who   
 are going to die because he can do    
 very little about it.                 
   He is an ideal person to be a church
 officer because he is one of the most 
 caring, helpful and friendly people I 
 have ever met.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
