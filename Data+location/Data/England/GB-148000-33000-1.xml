		<title>01Farming, Hellangove Farm</title>
		<content> Size 150 acres, 7 acres woodland.     
 Mainly in grass in the simmer and     
 winter feed=fodder beat (also silage  
 available). Mainly diary but          
 introducing beef. Hereford bull and   
 Fresian cow. Herd of 98. Calving is   
 December-February/March. Drying up of 
 cows is July-December. During the time
 when the Castle-An-Dinas Quarry       
 adjacent to Hellangove was working    
 sediment appeared in the milk. The    
 milk was unsaleable and the herd had  
 to be destroyed. Legal action was     
 taken against the Amalgamated         
 Roadstone Company owners of the quarry
 - as it was thought that quarry dust  
 was the basic cause with resulting    
 acid rain. The adjoining woods also   
 appeared dead, but once the quarry    
 closed, 'bloomed' again. Machines do  
 much of the work on the farm today.   
 Labourers have dwindled to one.       </content>
