 built in .The second school was built 
 in 1853.In Willand school before this 
 one,there were two classes and in each
 class there were about thirty children
 .Most pupils walked to school and if  
 they were very lucky they cycled to   
 school. Teachers mostly cycled to     
 school or walked. They did not have a 
 sports day of their own. They went to 
 the village sports once a year where  
 people came from miles around and     
 joined in and watched.It was one of   
 the biggest village sports in Devon.  
 If they were late to school they had a
 black mark in the register.At school  
 they could not have school dinner.They
 were not allowed to go home for their 
 school dinner they mostly had meat and
 veg. Sometimes they had cottage pie.  </content>
