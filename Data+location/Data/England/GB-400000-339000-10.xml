		<title>10Churches and Chapels(cont.)</title>
		<content>There is a United Reform Chapel in New 
Road, and opposite is a small cemetery 
which is no longer used. The Village   
cemetery is at Christ Church, and a new
cemetery has opened on the outskirts of
the village along Hollington Road.     
There is St Chads C.of E. Church at    
Freehay which serves a widespread rural
parish. The Vicarage at Freehay has    
recently been sold and the little      
School closed down. The Parish is      
administered by the Rural Dean of      
Cheadle.
