   Originally the Green was a rubbish  
 tip,because there were no dustbin     
 men.People used to dump all their     
 rubbish in the middle of the village. 
   The first headmaster of the Grammar 
 School,Mr.Noble,decided to have it    
 levelled and grassed over and to have 
 a wall built round it.The Green is    
 about two hundred years old and the   
 wall was made about a hundred and     
 fifty years ago.The boys at the       
 Grammar School used the Green as a    
 cricket pitch.                        
   The Green belongs to the people of  
 Scorton and it will never be built    
 on.There are only two other raised    
 Greens in the whole of England.       
   We play on it.Village cricket teams 
 have matches on it every weekend      
 during the summer time.
