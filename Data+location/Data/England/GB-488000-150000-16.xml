		<title>16Public Houses in Ash.</title>
		<content>   There are twelve public houses in   
 Ash in our block. Two are more that   
 400 years old. The majority sell food 
 mainly snacks at the bar. Children are
 catered for in more that half of them.
   The most popular drinks sold are    
 Real Ale and Lager.                   
   Nearly all the buildings date from  
 the mid-nineteenth century when the   
 population of the village rapidly     
 increased because of the building of  
 the Aldershot Barracks.               
   Some of the pubs hire rooms to local
 clubs for their weekly meetings.      
   The variety of names reflect the    
 many aspects of the local area -      
 The Bricklayer's Arms, The Swan, The  
 Dover (Drover) Arms, The King's Head, 
 The Chester Arms, The Lion Brewery,   
 The Standard or England, The          
 Cricketers, The Greyhound and The     
 Admiral Napier.                       </content>
