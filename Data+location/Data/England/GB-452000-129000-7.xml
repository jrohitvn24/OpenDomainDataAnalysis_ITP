		<content> (e) The Clerk was instructed to write 
 to Winchester City Council to ask for 
 the Old Well in Avington to be classed
 as a {Listed Building}                
 (f) Reference was made to the recently
 opened {M3 Motorway}which runs through
 the Itchen Valley to the west of our  
 area. It was suggested that Exit 7 on 
 the motorway should have              
 'King's Worthy' added to it.          
                                       
 Although the above meeting has no     
 direct reference to our area or       
 block,it still gives a good idea of   
 how a Parish Council operateas in     
 1985. It should be                    
 remembered,however,that our area comes
 under the administration of this      
 Parish Council.
