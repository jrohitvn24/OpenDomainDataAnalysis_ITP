 Skittle ball is a game with two teams.
 Both boys and girls can play.You need 
 a pitch with a line about ten to      
 twelve metres long,and a circle about 
 two metres in diameter at each end.   
 There  are seven people in each team  
 with one skittle guard,two defenders, 
 two centres and two attacks.

{Sports day.                           
 In summer we go to the playing field  
 and have a sports day.Every time that 
 you come first,second or third you get
 a badge and some points.At the end of 
 the races we add up all the points and
 the person with the most points gets a
 silver cup. The  runner up gets a     
 second place cup.
