		<title>11Spilsil Court,Staplehurst.</title>
		<content>   Spilsil Court has passed through    
 many vicissitudes since its name first
 appears in 1307 when a family of that 
 name lived there during Edward II's   
 reign.                                
   The fourteenth century house would  
 have been fortified and surrounded by 
 a moat.This is easy to visualize when 
 looking at the three ponds that remain
 today although the actual house of    
 that date must have been incorporated 
 into the later Elizabethan structure. 
   During the Regency and Victorian    
 period Spilsil temporarily ceased to  
 be the manor house and became more and
 more derelict as a farm.              
   The gardens of Spilsil have today   
 many features which were commonplace  
 in the days of Elizabeth I including a
 fine herb garden.
