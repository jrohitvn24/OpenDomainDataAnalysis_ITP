		<title>11BROOKSIDE WOODS ROTHERHAM</title>
		<content> The woods are situated just off       
 Brookside and they stretch right up to
 a snicket on Pearsons Close and       
 further until it joins Gibbings Greave
 Woods,and if you look the other way   
 you should see the farmland.When it is
 out of golf season a friend and I do  
 an assault course through             
 Herringthorpe Woods,across the golf   
 course and down through Gibbings      
 Greave Woods.                         
     There are lots of differant kinds 
 of people go into the woods,the more  
 dangerous of them are probably youths 
 with air rifles and youths on         
 motorcycles.There are gangs of        
 skinheads walking round but you don't 
 see many of those.Although there are  
 lots of dangerous people there,most   
 people are just walking their dogs.
