		<title>02Change in the Fens l900-85</title>
		<content>   Since drainage of the Fens in the   
 17th Century the district had been    
 used as summer pasture land. It was   
 not until the early years of the 20th 
 century that its potential as rich    
 agricultural land began to be         
 realised. Today most of the block is  
 intensively farmed by one large       
 company, growing potatoes, sugar beet,
 cereals and carrots. Some grass is    
 also grown for the company's dairy    
 operations in the area to the North.  
 The peat soil has wasted away to a    
 great extent and now in some parts the
 clay soil beneath is exposed.         
   At Shrub Hill there are some water  
 filled pits which are all that remains
 of the brickworks on the site. This   
 was served at one time by a rail link 
 from the Ely-Norwich line, and in     
 later years by part of the Wissington 
 Light Railway, closed in 1957.        </content>
