 Church of England denomination.{      
{ St Wilfred's,}built soon after 1700, 
 using stones from the ancient church  
 at Aunby, stands in the grounds of    
 Holywell Hall. Privately owned and    
 maintained, it is not de-consecrated  
 but it is classified as redundant.    
{ St Stephen's,}Careby, dates in part  
 from late Norman times. Services are  
 held once every three weeks and on    
 special occasions: weddings, Easter,  
 Christmas etc. The congregation of 16 
 to 20 people come from nearby parishes
 as well as from Careby itself.        
  Approximately Â£10,000 is required to 
 repair the church tower. A barbecue, a
 flower festival and hunter trials have
 so far raised over Â£2,250. Labour is  
 provided by the government-sponsored  
 Manpower Services Commission, only the
 materials have to be paid for.        </content>
