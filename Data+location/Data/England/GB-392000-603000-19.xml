  This area around and below the       
 Drakes-Stone was taken over as Nature 
 Reserve by the Northumberlan Wildlife 
 Trust in the 1970's.Previously it had 
 been grazed by sheep and managed as a 
 Grouse Moor by regular burning of th  
 heather.                              
   There is now a Nature Trail marked  
 out with leaflets. A car park was     
 formed by the Forestry Commission.    
 There is also an Information Office   
 run by the Northumberland National    
 Park in which most of our area lies.  
   Th Drake Stone has legends told     
 about it,and ther are signs of an old 
 industry around it-millstone making.  
 Parts can still be seen to the west of
 the area and the holes left where they
 have been cut from.
