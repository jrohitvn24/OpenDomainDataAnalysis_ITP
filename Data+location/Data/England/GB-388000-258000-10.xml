		<title>10MAIN ROADS,ODDINGLEY AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
  The main roads in our area are the{M5
 and the{A38.}Both of these are used by
 commuters going into Birmingham.They  
 are particularly busy between 8.00 &amp;  
 9.00am and 5.00 &amp; 6.00pm.At present   
 the{M5}is in the process of being     
 widened from two lanes to three to    
 cope with the increasing volume of    
 traffic.These roadworks are causing   
 heavy congestion on the A38 because of
 diversions                            
      In contrast all the other roads  
 are minor country lanes.These are     
 typical of many country areas,narrow, 
 winding and badly maintained.In the   
 days of horse and carts they may have 
 been satisfactory but now with tract- 
 ors and other heavy vehicles they are 
 often inadequate.Because of this      
 traffic old canal bridges have recent-
 ly been renewed.{                     </content>
