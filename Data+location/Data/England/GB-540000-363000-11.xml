		<title>11HALTON HOLEGATE SCHOOL FETE</title>
		<content>      The annual School Fete is usually
 held on a Friday evening in June.  It 
 is held to raise money for school     
 funds, and has proved to be a village 
 event for everyone in the village, and
 not just for those involved in the    
 school.  There is a Fancy Dress       
 Competition for the children, and a   
 special attraction such as the Spilsby
 Town Band, the Halton Handbell        
 Ringers, or Slide Shows.              
      Stalls are run by the parents,   
 and unwanted items are sent to school 
 to sell, and these include toys,      
 books, household items, bric-a-brac,  
 plants, and home made cakes.          
 Refreshments are served during the    
 evening.  There are games such as Bran
 Tub, Bean Bag, Darts, and throwing    
 wet sponges at boys in the stocks.  In
 1985 the Fete raised a record total of
 Â£228.                                 </content>
