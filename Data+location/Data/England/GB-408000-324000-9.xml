 to the surgery you ring the bell and a
 nurse/receptionist gives you a ticket 
 with a number and {A or S}on. {A}is   
 for Dr.Aldridge {S}is for Dr.Slater.  
 You then sit down and wait for the    
 doctor.There is a board on the wall   
 which gives the names of the doctors  
 and says next paient.When it is time  
 for the next person to go in a buzzer 
 goes and a green light lights up on   
 the word next patient by the doctor's 
 name and you put your ticket in a pot 
 that says used tickets and go in to   
 the doctor.He opens one of his drawers
 and gets out your card and then       
 examines you. He gives you a          
 prescription which you take to the    
 dispensary and they give you the      
 medicine you need.If you are too ill  
 to go to the surgery you phone up and 
 the doctor comes to your house.       </content>
