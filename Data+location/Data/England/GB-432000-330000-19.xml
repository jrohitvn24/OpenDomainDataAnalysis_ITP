		<title>19THE GOLF COURSE IN SINFIN.</title>
		<content> When I play golf I always play on the 
 practice and putting greens. You have 
 to pay Â£1.00 to play on the practice  
 and putting greens. The people who own
 the golf course are the council. It   
 costs Â£3.00 to play on the main course
 and lots of people use it. I go on the
 golf course when I come home from     
 school. There are 18 holes around the 
 course and there is a club house at   
 the end. You have to be over 18 to go 
 in the club house. The golf course has
 a golf shop where you can buy golfing 
 equipment.
