 My guinea pig is ginger,black &amp; white,
 She lives with Thomas but they do not 
 fight.                                
 Her name is Katie &amp; she is very sweet,
 She is nice &amp; fat 'cause she likes to 
 eat.                                  
           ...........                 
 She lives in a hutch, to the fence it 
 is screwed,                           
 Dandelions and pellets are some of her
 food,                                 
 She has lots of water in a dish to    
 drink,                                
 Katie is the nicest guinea pig ever I 
 think.                                
           ...........
