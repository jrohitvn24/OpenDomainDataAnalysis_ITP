		<title>11 POLITICS IN NORTHAMPTON</title>
		<content>Northampton is a Conservative          
controlled town. This may not have been
so if the Independents had not joined  
forces with them against Labour. After 
the last election the results were:-   
   Conservatives.....34 seats;         
   Labour............29 seats;         
   The SDP........... 4 seats;         
   Liberal Alliance.. 1 seat.          
The leader of the conservatives in     
Northampton is W.D. Norton, who has a  
C.B.E. Some of the most interesting    
debates in the council chamber concern 
the future development of the town. For
example, a long-standing debate which  
has caused much heated discussion      
is the somewhat controversial          
proposal to replace the cobbles in the 
market square with new ones. Although  
intended to help preserve the          
traditional characteristics of the town
such a scheme is considered expensive. </content>
