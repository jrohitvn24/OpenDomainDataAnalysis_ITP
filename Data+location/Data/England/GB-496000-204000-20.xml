		<content> Predominantly Church of England. The  
 area falls within the diocese of      
 Oxford and ther are two places of     
 worship - the Church of St. John,     
 Ashley Green and the church of St.    
 Michael and All Angels, Whelpley Hill.
 Services are held weekly at Ashley    
 Green but there are no services on the
 first Sunday of each month in Whelpley
 Hill. The one minister of religion in 
 the area is resident in Ashley Green  
 and is responsible for services at    
 both the churches. There is some      
 threat that upon the retirement of the
 present incumbent the parish will be  
 amalgamated with one of the larger    
 parishes in the nearby town of        
 Chesham.
