		<content> My first recollection of village life 
 was walking 1.5 miles to school around
 1918.Now traffic is heavier a bus     
 conveys the children.It was unusual   
 for married women to go out to work   
 except for seasonal farm work.        
  The men were employed on farms in the
 village - now every able bodied person
 needs to find work away.Everyone      
 helped each other in trouble,there    
 was no pension and money was scarce.  
 Entertainment was made in the village:
 skating on the pond,a village feast,  
 sports,cricket,football and quoit     
 matches.The village has lost it's     
 community spirit.                     
 Children played 'fox-off','hop scotch'
 'whip and top','rounders'etc., now    
 they watch television.To hear local   
 news you went to the smithy,shop or   
 pub.Alas these have gone with the     
 exception of the pub and the chapel.  </content>
