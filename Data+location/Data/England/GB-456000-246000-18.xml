		<title>18Health Concerns</title>
		<content> In the rural areas of South Northants.
 health problems are exacerbated by the
 lack of transport.  Doctors have      
 centralised their surgeries in health 
 centres built in the towns &amp; larger   
 villages.  Patients are required to   
 attend the surgery for all but the    
 very severe illnesses.  Byfield,      
 Towcester or Brackley are more than 5 
 miles away for medical attention &amp; the
 collection of prescriptions.          
 Brackley Cottage Hospital used to be  
 the casualty unit &amp; general hospital  
 for the area.  It is one of the few   
 remaining small hospitals but its     
 future is uncertain due to restraints 
 on finance.  This is causing great    
 concern locally, people prefering     
 personal &amp; friendly service.  However 
 hospitals at Banbury or Northampton   
 are used increasingly, especially for 
 more complicated medication.          </content>
