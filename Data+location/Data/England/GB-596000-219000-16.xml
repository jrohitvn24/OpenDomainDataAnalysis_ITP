		<content>{RYE FARM _}Mr.Peter Bunting, the      
 farmer, runs a mixed farm. He has     
 sheep and heifers. There is one bull  
 and a few Jacobs sheep. Wheat and     
 barley are grown. Rats are the main   
 pests around the barns where the      
 animal food is stored. In one of the  
 barns all the beams are twisted _ this
 was caused by the Colchester          
 Earthquake one hundred years ago. The 
 house at Rye Farm has a medieval moat 
 and was originally owned by St.John's 
 Abbey, Colchester in the 13th century.
{SHEEP SHEARING AT WICK FARM_}         
 Australian sheep shearers in action!  
 The sheep were brought from Rye Farm  
 to Wick Farm for a joint shearing     
 session. They shear the sheep on      
 boards to stop the fleece from getting
 soiled. They shear a sheep in only two
 minutes. The fleece that is sheared is
 sent to Oxford to be cleaned.         </content>
