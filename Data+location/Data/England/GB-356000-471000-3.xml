		<title>03The River Lune at Melling.</title>
		<content>                                       
   The River Lune is prone to flood    
over the pasture. Attempts were made to
straighten the course and lessen the   
force on the railway bridge but it is  
now reverting to its old course by     
depositing large shingle banks. There  
is no road here but there used to be a 
ferry across. The river bailiff who    
lived at Arkholme had a small rowing   
boat in which he would ferry people    
across the river. He even took motor   
bikes across! His boat was also used   
for rescuing sheep caught in the       
floods. He died about 26 years ago and 
there has been no crossing since.      
Sometimes people cross illegally by the
railway bridge. Part of this stretch   
of the river is now owned by Earl Peel 
of Leighton Hall. For a season of      
alternate days, fishing for salmon and 
trout,anglers pay 450 pounds per rod.  </content>
