    It had 32 rooms to begin with and  
 it now has 60 rooms.                  
    The Orwell Hotel was smaller than  
 it is now and had a large garden which
 is now the car park.The hotel was     
 built opposite the station because    
 most vistors arrived by train.        
     It is one of the most used hotels 
 even though it is not on the sea      
 front.                                
    It has a large room which is called
 the{Suffolk Suite}which is used  for  
 lots of different meetings.
