Churchill Church of England Voluntary Controlled Primary School is an amalgamation of the former Hosey Boys' School, Hosey Common and the St Mary's Junior Girls' and Infants' School, London Road, Westerham. The school transferred to its accommodation in Rysted Lane in 1986. It has a fully equipped computer suite with 15 computers. The school offers a wide range of pre-morning, lunchtime and after-school clubs, which include cross-country running, recorder groups, craft, netball, football, cricket, badminton, rounders, gardening and athletics. Visits to various places of educational interest are also arranged as part of the normal curriculum.
