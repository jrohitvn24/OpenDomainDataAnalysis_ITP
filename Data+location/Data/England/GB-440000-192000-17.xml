There are three manor houses in our    
block, two in West Hanney and one in   
East Hanney.                           
{Prior's Court.}                       
Prior's Court is the oldest of the     
three manor houses and is actually     
mentioned in the original Domesday     
book.                                  
{Philberd's Manor.}                    
Philberd's Manor is thought to be      
fourteenth century.At one time it was  
owned by King Edward and there are     
signsthat it was once surrounded by a  
moat.                                  
{West Hanney House.}                   
West Hanney House is thought to have   
been built in the 1490's.A lot of the  
house is tudor.
