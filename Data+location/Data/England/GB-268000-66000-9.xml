 There is a Women's Circle in the      
 village hall at Combe, and a Women's  
 Institute at Scorriton. An annual     
 flower show is put on, and a Christmas
 party. For the younger generation     
 there is a Youth Club which meets at  
 Scorriton Methodist Chapel, and discos
 are organized from time to time. Some 
 of the younger inhabitants also belong
 to the Buckfastleigh Scouts, or to the
 Young Farmers' Club which is based in 
 Newton Abbot.                         
                                       
 The village of Scorriton is twinned   
 with Fontaine-Henry in France, and    
 visits are arranged each year in one  
 direction or the other. A party of    
 about 24 visitors from Fontaine-Henry 
 is expected in August 1985.
