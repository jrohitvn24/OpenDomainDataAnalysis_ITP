		<content>      Being a rural community there is 
 alimited amount of entertainment      
 within the area and therefore families
 with children (of pre-driving age)    
 tend to be a close knit unit.         
      With the children of varying ages
 going to different schools - some in  
 Himbleton , some in the nearest town  
 meal times at home do vary.           
      In our house breakfast usually   
 consists of cereals and/or bread or   
 toast with a drink of tea or fruit    
 juice. Because of school times lunch  
 tends to be a light meal with the main
 meal of the day in the evening when   
 the whole family eat together.
