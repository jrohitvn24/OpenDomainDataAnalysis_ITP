		<title>09TWO CHURCHES, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   The two Anglican churches in the    
 area look alike.Both of them have     
 towers which look like castle-tops and
 in their burial grounds they have     
 several table-top graves.             
   Great Somerford Church is dedicated 
 to St.Peter and St.Paul and the font  
 and walls are the oldest parts of the 
 building.It was built from local stone
 and even the roof is covered with     
 stone tiles.The earliest of the bells 
 was hung in 1480 and in 1975,because  
 they needed retuning and their wooden 
 support frame had become weakened,all 
 4 bells were taken down,retuned and   
 hung again on a new frame.            
   Little Somerford Church contains a  
 recently uncovered mural showing the  
 Ten Commandments and 2 angels.There is
 a large marble plaque to the memory of
 Walter Powell.It has Jacobean box pews
 and a Victorian font.                 </content>
