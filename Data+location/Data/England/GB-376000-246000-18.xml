		<content> By this time our French teacher Mrs.  
 Davies is already there. When we are  
 all there she says "hello" (in French)
 and we reply. After French we have    
 reading. Our last break is at 14.15.  
 After break we have games with class  
 7.We finish games at 15.30 and we get 
 changed and go home. When I get home I
 have a drink and some biscuits. At    
 16.00 I get changed and go out to     
 play. At 17.00 I have my tea then I go
 and get my leotard on ready for       
 gymnastics. I watch T.V. until 18.45. 
 At gymnastics we do warm-ups first.   
 Then at 19.00 we do varieties of gym. 
 At 21.00 my mum comes and picks us up 
 and takes us home.When I get home I am
 tired so I go to bed.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
