		<content> There are two windmills in Cross-in-  
 Hand,both are privately owned.        
  "New Mill " is found on a hill in a  
 field. Originally built in 1806 at    
 Mount Ephraim in Uckfield,it was moved
 to Cross-in-Hand in 1855 and to its   
 present site in 1868.It has been      
 damaged at various times by  gales and
 lightning and then repaired.          
   The sails were taken down in 1976,  
 only two are left.It is an            
 iron-sheeted post mill now in poor    
 condition, though restoration is      
 underway.                             
   "Old Mill" is found just south west 
 of "New Mill", it was built in the    
 early 18th century and demolished     
 about 1905.It is a postmill with only 
 a one story round house remaining.It  
 is now used as a store.
