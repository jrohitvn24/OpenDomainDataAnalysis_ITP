		<title>15Stanground Fire Station</title>
		<content>  We visited Stanground Fire Station.It
 is near the main roads to{Farcet,     
{Whittlesey}and{Peterborough.}One of   
 the firemen showed us the fire engines
 and other equipment and told us about 
 the work that they do.                
   The fire station was opened in 1977 
 and has twenty-nine men working there 
 in shifts.They are called out about   
 twenty-five times each week and       
 training also takes place at the      
 station.The men have keep fit lessons.
 As well as putting out fires,the men  
 go out to rescue people from car      
 crashes and they are trained to help  
 in an air or train crash.They have    
 special clothing and equipment which  
 they must keep in good condition.     
   The only other fire station in      
 Peterborough is in{Dogsthorpe.}
