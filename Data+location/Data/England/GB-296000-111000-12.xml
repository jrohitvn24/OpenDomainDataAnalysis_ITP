		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content>  We decided to make a survey of       
{employment}in our area and use our    
 school parents as a sample. We devised
 a{questionnaire}which we gave out to  
 the school. We had 154 answers. When  
 we examined them, we found that{139   
{fathers are employed,}22 of whom are  
 self-employed, 112 fathers work full  
 time and 5 work part time. The        
 remaining 15 or 10% are unemployed.   
{ 125 mothers are employed,}25 of these
 are self-employed, 30 mothers work    
 full time and 70 work part time, 29   
 mothers are house-wives.              
  The{biggest employer}was the County  
 Council whilst Whitbreads Brewery,    
 Stenners Engineering and Tiverton     
 Poultry Packers each employ 9 parents.
  17 parents are employed in food      
 distribution. 8 parents work for the  
 NHS and the rest work for services,   
 e.g. hairdressers and cleaners.       </content>
