		<content>{   Stoke House}was built by the Earl  
 of Coventry on the hill overlooking   
 Severn Stoke. It was rented by the    
 local Squire, who was employed to     
 watch over the village and to look    
 after the Lord's financial interests. 
 Later, this house was bought by a rich
 Ceylon tea plantation owner and sold  
 by his widow, along with the large    
 gardens, to a developer who demolished
 it and built Stoke Avenue. The{old    
{lodge house}can still be seen on the  
 roadside, and many of the old trees   
 from the gardens can still be seen in 
 amongst the new estate.               
    In 1910 there was a{wharf}on the   
 banks of the Severn near the village, 
 which was used to offload supplies of 
 coal and hay in the days of River     
 transport.
