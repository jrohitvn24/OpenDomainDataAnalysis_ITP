		<content>  It was July and it was our Sports Day
 which we have every year during the   
 summer term.Everybody was getting     
 ready for the event.The weather was   
 hot and sunny with a gentle           
 breeze.Chairs and tables were being   
 taken down to the field.Lots of       
 squeals of joy.Sweets were bought for 
 the Infants if they won a race and    
 medals for the Juniors if they had the
 highest number of points.             
  After lunch children went to get     
 changed into shorts and tee shirt and 
 plimsolls.The Infants get a sweet     
 every time they reach the end of a    
 race,a bigger sweet for coming first  
 or second.At the end of the afternoon 
 all the points awarded to the Juniors 
 for coming first second or third are  
 added together.The first year with the
 highest number of points gets a medal 
 as do the other junior years.         </content>
