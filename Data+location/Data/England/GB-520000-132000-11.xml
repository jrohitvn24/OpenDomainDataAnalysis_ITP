 hour. The council plan that the new   
 road will be landscaped with native   
 trees, so hopefully the wild plants   
 and wildlife will return. This work is
 due to be completed at end of 1986.   
 Smaller road to south runs 4 miles    
 from Roffey to Pease Potage where it  
 joins A23 south to Brighton and       
 M23/A23 north to Crawley, Gatwick     
 Airport, and London 30 odd miles away.
  This attractive road through northern
 edge of St Leondards Forest is like a 
 green tunnel in spring and summer with
 trees meeting overhead for most of its
 length. The village of Colgate is     
 halfway along. Due to the road works  
 on A264 a great deal more traffic     
 charges through the village ignoring  
 the 40mph speed limit.
