		<content> Most of the houses are owner-occupied.
 Little development has taken place but
 some refurbishment of farm houses and 
 buildings has taken place, in keeping 
 with the environment. The buildings   
 generally, many of them being very    
 old, are of traditional Sussex style, 
 being built of red brick and tile     
 hung.                                 
 The houses not owner-occupied are     
 usually tied cottages, some of which  
 have been sold as private homes. Most 
 of the farm houses are attached to    
 working farms. Only three are         
 non-working at the present time. The  
 size of these houses varies from small
 cottages to large farm houses, mostly 
 of the eighteenth century. Some farms 
 have out-buildings converted for      
 modern uses (e.g. garages)
