		<title>12Life as a Teenager.</title>
		<content> Our group of fifteen year olds all    
 live within 3 miles of school. We     
 attended a first and a middle school  
 before moving to high school at the   
 age of 13. We study eight subjects for
 our "O", 16+, and "C.S.E." Out of     
 school we do a variety of things such 
 as going to discos, horse-riding,     
 playing football, rugby, netball, and 
 cricket. We also like to watch T.V.   
 and video films. Most of us go on     
 holidays in England and Wales,but some
 of us have been to Spain,Italy and    
 France.One girl in our group lived in 
 Australia for many years before       
 returning to Redditch.We are fortunate
 that we live in a new town,with nice  
 housing and shopping.
