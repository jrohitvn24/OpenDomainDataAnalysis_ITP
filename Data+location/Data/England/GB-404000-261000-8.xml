		<content> Sambourne forms part of the           
 ecclesiastical parish of Coughton,    
 though it has been a separate civil   
 parish at least since the 17th        
 century.It is divided from Coughton by
 Cane Brook,Ryknield Street (here known
 as Haydon Way ) which crosses the     
 parish from north to south.The village
 itself,about 2 miles north-west of    
 Coughton,is centred round a small     
 triangular green at the junction of 4 
 roads and contains several            
 timber-framed buildings of 17th       
 century date.The Green Dragon Inn,a   
 more modern building,has a 17th       
 century extension with timber-framing.
