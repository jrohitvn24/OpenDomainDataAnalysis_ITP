		<title>09  VILLAGE LIFE-HAMPTON LUCY</title>
		<content>                                       
     Mr.Macloud has been running the   
village store in Hampton Lucy since    
1948, when he inherited it from his    
father who started it at the beginning 
of the century.                        
     When he took over in 1948, ration 
coupons and bread units issued by the  
Ministry of Food were still in use. He 
now serves the local farms and nearby  
Charlecote with his delivery van.      
     The mill was allowed to fall into 
disuse, but it is now in operation     
again, producing stone-ground wholemeal
flour.                                 
     The river attracts fishermen and  
artists along its banks.               
     No village industry has survived, 
although a sand-blasting firm is based 
in the village.                        
     Recently a daily bus service to   
Stratford-on-Avon has been introduced. </content>
