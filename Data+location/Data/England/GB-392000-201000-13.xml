		<title>13  LOCAL HISTORY</title>
		<content>  Our best claim to fame lies in our   
 rich history. The Prehistoric Cotswold
 Ridgeway crosses our D-Block. We have 
 evidence of Neolithic and Roman finds 
 here. Our name Sapperton is thought to
 be 'Sapere-tun', Anglo Saxon for      
 'Homestead of the soap makers'.We are 
 mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086
 and Charles 1 slept at the home of Sir
 Henry Poole in Sapperton in 1644. The 
 longest Canal Tunnel (at that time)   
 was cut through the hill in 1784 and  
 was followed in 1845 by a Railway     
 Tunnel. Throughout time we have       
 attracted visitors, our most recent   
 group being the followers of William  
 Morris who became known as the 'School
 of Sapperton Craftsmen' and who built 
 many beautifully integrated houses    
 here.
