		<title>03WATER SUPPLY - POTT SHRIGLEY</title>
		<content>  At present Pott Shrigley receives all
 its mains water from a borehole about 
 a mile to the east of the village.    
 During the last ten years this source 
 has not always fully met the demand   
 and in periods of drought the service 
 reservoir has run dry. Supplies have  
 had to be supplemented by road tankers
 on five occasions.                    
  Tankers obtained this water from the 
 Adlington borehole system, which was  
 commissioned in 1971 and now supplies 
 Poynton and Adlington. As this is a   
 reliable source of good quality water,
 North West Water Authority now plan to
 build a new pumping station at Roundy 
 Lane to extract and raise water for   
 Pott Shrigley permanently. Softening  
 of Adlington water by an ion-exchange 
 process had to be reduced in July     
 under EEC legislation concerning links
 between soft water and heart disease. </content>
