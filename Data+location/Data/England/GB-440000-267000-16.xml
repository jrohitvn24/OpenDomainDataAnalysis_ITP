		<content> We carried out a survey in Marton and 
 Birdingbury to find out to what extent
 the villages are self sufficient.We   
 discovered that most people do their  
 major shopping in a large supermarket 
 but they do use their village shops   
 regularly.The post offices are in     
 constant use with all but one person  
 questioned  using them every week.    
 About half of the people made use of  
 the village pubs and attended         
 functions in the village halls. All   
 those questioned used pubs outside the
 villages and attended social functions
 elsewhere.A majority felt that the    
 villages were well equipped with play 
 facilities for children.Most asked    
 did not use the bus service often or  
 at all and overwhelmingly felt they   
 could not live happily in the area    
 without a car.We concluded that tha   
 villages are not self-sufficient.     </content>
