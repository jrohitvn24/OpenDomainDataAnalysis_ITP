		<content> Six small zones only can be designated
 to this title.OVERROSS STREET:an area 
 approx.55ydsx42yds, owned by the Town 
 council. After 4 houses demolished it 
 was once used by local garage,but now 
 totally disused.BRAMPTON RD: privately
 owned area at entrance to Verschoyle  
 House, bordering Oaklands, not used   
 since planning refused for use as pub-
 lic house.CROFTS LANE:owned by retail 
 furniture shop,but possibly on Town   
 plan as new multi-storey car park or  
 mall of shops.BROOKEND ST:privately   
 owned,used for informal parking, but  
 sometimes used for visiting showground
 Two properties in the area are dere-  
 lict,but both would be worthy of rest-
 oration - in GREYTREE RD an old cott- 
 age with evidence of wattle &amp; daub con
 struction; on STATION ST an old engin-
 eering works, now lying empty although
 now owned by PGL Holidays.            </content>
