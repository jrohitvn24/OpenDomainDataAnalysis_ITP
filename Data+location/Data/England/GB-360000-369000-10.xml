		<title>10DALEFORD QUARRY,WHITEGATE</title>
		<content> This particular site was chosen       
 because there is much sand and it is  
 mainly poor farmland.  The land is not
 suitable for farming because the sand 
 takes all the moisture out of the     
 ground.  The quarry has been working  
 for 25-30 years.  It is not likely to 
 expand a great deal, though extraction
 is starting on a near-by hill.        
                                       
 The quarry is in the green belt area  
 and the quality of sand varies        
 greatly.  The limit of extraction in  
 depth is the water table:  this is    
 where the sand becomes rather like    
 clay.  The sand is extracted by J.C.B.
 mechanical machines that dig the sand.
 About 75 000 tonnes of sand are       
 quarried annually.
