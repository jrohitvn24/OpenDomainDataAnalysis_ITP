		<title>18Coaley Mill</title>
		<content>  Coaley Mill is a water-powered mill. 
 There has been a mill here since      
 before 1300. Originally there were two
 small grist mills. From 1734 to 1944  
 it became an iron works making spades 
 and shovels. When it was closed in    
 1944 it was taken over by two local   
 farmers. Gradually the buildings      
 decayed and the machinery was sold as 
 scrap.                                
  In 1962 the site was taken over by   
 its present owner. He demolished the  
 old house and rebuilt it from new     
 foundations. He renovated and extended
 the workshops. The present mill was   
 built on the site of derilect         
 buildings.                            
  In 1978 a water turbine was installed
 to generate electricity for the mill  
 and the house. Today, the mill grinds 
 grain and sells flour, hydro-electric 
 and flour milling equipment.          </content>
