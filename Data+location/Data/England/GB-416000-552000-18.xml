		<title>18FARMING</title>
		<content> A typical farm in our area is called  
 Swinburn's farm.It is an arable farm  
 which has about 10 different kinds of 
 crops growing in the fields.The farmer
 has to wake up at 3.00a.m.to milk the 
 cows and then he puts them in a shed  
 until it gets light.Then he puts them 
 in a field to graze until 8:00 p.m.   
 which is when he milks them again     
 Mr.Swinburn owns a land coverage      
 of 180 acres.On an average a day at   
 Swinburns farm the hens lay 70        
 eggs.The usual machines that are used 
 for the fields are a tractor and a    
 combine harvester.The jobs that have  
 to be done on an ordinary day are     
 feeding animals,picking turnips and   
 cleaning them.He has to transplant    
 cabbages and in the late summer he has
 to cut hay and silage.
