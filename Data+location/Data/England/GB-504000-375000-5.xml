		<content>{Living at Sudbrooke}                  
 I live in Sudbrooke.Most of the land  
 is wood and there is farmland         
 there.Sudbrooke is peaceful.My        
 garden is one acre and the estate is  
 cutting down more and more trees to   
 make room for houses to be built.The  
 housing estate is growing and the     
 woodland is disappearing.I like living
 in Sudbrooke because it is quiet and  
 there are rivers and lakes.Sudbrooke  
 park where  I live{used to be the     
{finest pleasure gardens in England.}My
 grandma owns the largest part of it   
   and she keeps it nice with stone    
 ornaments and things like that.       
    There is hardly any traffic.When I 
 grow up  I want to restore the wood   
 and rebuild the Manor which was       
 demolished in the thirties.My grandma 
 owns the butler's house.
