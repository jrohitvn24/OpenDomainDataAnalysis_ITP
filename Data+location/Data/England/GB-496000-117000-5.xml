		<content> There is a home for mentally          
 retarded adults, called CARE,         
 (Cottage And Rural Enterprises), at   
 Burton Rough, which employs many      
 people,some of whom live-in as part   
 of the job. Its aim is to enable      
 mentally handicapped adults to live as
 normal a life as possible.            
                                       
 In the workshops they make wooden     
 objects, including furniture, and     
 handicrafts such as soft toys.        
 The goods are sold to the general     
 public along with plants and          
 vegetables which are grown in the     
 garden. CARE provides both homes and  
 work for its residents.               
                                       
 Many local residents are involved in  
 bed-and-breakfast, mainly for the     
 summer tourist trade, as there are no 
 hotels in the area.                   </content>
