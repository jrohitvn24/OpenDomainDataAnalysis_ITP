 The Percy Tenantry Column lies at the 
 side of the road into Alnwick from the
 south.There is a plaque on one side of
 the column which was erected,dedicated
 and inscribed by thankful tenantry of 
 the second Duke of Northumberland in  
 1816 who,in times of great depression 
 reduced the rents.The column is made  
 of sandstone and there are four stone 
 lions around the base.There is another
 lion on top of the column.A feature of
 this lion is its straight tail (a     
 symbol of the Percy lion). The grounds
 of the column are well_kept and many  
 towns_folk use the grounds for        
 sunbathing and having picnics.
