		<title>05HONLEY'S SPIDER ALLEY</title>
		<content>   A centuries old walk in the village 
 of Honley would be lost if a builder's
{planning application}went ahead.      
  {"Spider Alley",}which is sometimes  
 named "Honley Gardens", has been here 
 for many centuries and numerous people
 in Honley want to see it stay. Over a 
 thousand people have signed a{petition
 to save the Alley, a path leading to  
 the former "Stepping Stones" across   
 the River Holme.                      
   The protesters argued that there was
 sufficient building land in Honley to 
 meet housing demands. The plan would  
 be bad for the village's character,   
 amenity and setting. A walk with      
 trees, fields, river and waterfall,   
 is something a community should always
 have.                                 
   Long live "Spider Alley"!           
                                       
                                       </content>
