		<content> Our block includes the major part of  
 Wiveliscombe,a small rural town of    
 less than 2000 inhabitants.A once     
 prosperous market and brewery town it 
 has declined to parish status.        
 The 1980's have seen some             
 environmental improvements with the   
 opening of a by-pass,and the face lift
 given to the Square.Kingsmead         
 Comprehensive acts as a focal point   
 within the rural community.It provides
 useful numbers of jobs and draws      
 children from a wide area,including   
 farms,hamlets and the village of      
 Fitzhead.The area is poorly served by 
 public transport so entertainment is  
 localised especially for youngsters   
 15% of Kingsmeads pupils live on farms
 but agriculture provides relatively   
 few employment opporunities.The school
 has been nationally acclaimed for its 
 careers record                        </content>
