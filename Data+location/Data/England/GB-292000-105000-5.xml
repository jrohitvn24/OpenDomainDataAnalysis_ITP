		<title>05FARMING:THE FARMER'S YEAR</title>
		<content> A farmer's day varies according to the
 season. In early spring fences have to
 be made stock-proof, fertilizer is    
 sown on the grass and the fields      
 ploughed, prepared and tilled with    
 spring corn. Winter corn is sown sim- 
 ilarly in autumn. When the corn is a  
 few inches high in late spring it is  
 sprayed to prevent weeds from growing.
 Late spring sheep are docked before   
 shearing in early summer. During      
 summer, there are silage, hay and corn
 harvests, and dipping of sheep (also  
 in autumn). Late summer weeds are cut 
 in grass fields. In autumn potatoes,  
 sugar beet and other root crops are   
 harvested. Hedges are cut. Winter     
 brings the lambing season, the making 
 of hedges, and the continual tending  
 to livestock housed until signs of    
 spring.
