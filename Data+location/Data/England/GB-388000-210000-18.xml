		<content> This is one of the largest in the     
 parish, although not all the land lies
 within the parish boundary. In total  
 there are 500 acres,of which 300 are  
 arable, producing mostly barley,with  
 wheat and oil-seed rape and in the    
 last 2 years peas as a protein crop.  
 The rough grassland is used for store 
 cattle and ponies, while the remaining
 140 acres is woodland,producing some  
 fencing materialsand in the last 2    
 seasons a pheasant shhot has been     
 started on a syndicated basis with    
 some 2000 birds being bought in for   
 release.                              
 The owner is Keith Broadstock, and he 
 and one full-time worker run the farm 
 with the help of casual workers during
 the busy seasons of harvest and       
 planting.
