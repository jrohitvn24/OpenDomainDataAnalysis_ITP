		<title>11TEENAGE DISCO - HEDNESFORD</title>
		<content>Apart from the Guides and Cubs (for    
the younger people) the disco is the   
main event of the week. It is usually  
held on Mondays and Fridays at the     
Aquarius Ballroom, Hednesford.   The   
disco is run by voluntary helpers and  
the local police and is supported by   
S.P.A.C.E. ( Staffordshire Police      
Activity and Community Enterprise ).   
Although the disco was opened at the   
beginning of October 1983, it was not  
the first disco - the first was run by 
the Council.   When the police disco   
first opened, numbers were few         
(approx. 100), but now they have risen 
to 1464. Since the opening of the      
disco, over 2000 pounds has been       
raised, which has gone to various      
groups: the S.P.A.C.E. scheme; senior  
citizens and local charities.          
  Attendants come from schools all over
the area and are always welcome.       </content>
