		<content>  The Baptist Church plays an important
 role in the community. It is an open  
 house, and those outside the church   
 should be able to see that they can   
 come to find a caring friend. Youth is
 an important part of the church and   
 organisations are run for those inside
 and outside the church today including
 Youth clubs, a Junior Choir and       
 occasional summer fun days. The church
 becomes involved in community         
 projects, and the team work involved  
 strengthens community relationships.  
 At the suggestion of the Baptist      
 Church the musical "Greater than Gold"
 was performed by villagers in         
 Alvechurch Primary School.
