		<content> The prepared palettes are kept in the 
 growing rooms for approx.3 weeks.The  
 air must be circulated so hot air is  
 drawn out from the top and pumped back
 in again at the bottom.This stops     
 carbon dioxide forming which would    
 prevent the mycelia fruiting.The out- 
 sides of the growing sheds are covered
 in black plastic to draw in heat.     
 Inside it is covered with a double    
 thickness of insulation and finished  
 off with a white plastic to reflect   
 heat and light.The mushrooms have a   
 six week cycle consisting of four     
 'breaks'or'flushes'.The men pick the  
 first break,and pack them into        
 cardboard baskets called'chips' which 
 hold 1.361kg.Between breaks the       
 compost is watered.There are 3 to 4   
 days between each break.The mushrooms 
 are mainly sold to wholesale markets  
 in Doncaster,Hull and Bradford.       </content>
