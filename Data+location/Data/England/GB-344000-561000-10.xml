		<content> Scaleby Castle is now the home of     
 the Liberal peer Lord Henley who has  
 owned it for six years since the death
 of his father. It was begun by Richard
 de Tilliol (the Rider) in the 12th.   
 century and developed by his family   
 over the years.                       
 The castle was garrisoned and beseiged
 in 1644 and burnt in 1648. Richard    
 Gilpin rebuilt the west half of the   
 south wall in 1685 and his grandson   
 built the porch in 1737. From 1741 the
 house was unoccupied for many years.  
 Today the castle has been transformed 
 into a family home which is surrounded
 by a moat and trees. It is approached 
 by a half mile tarmac drive from the  
 Lodge.
