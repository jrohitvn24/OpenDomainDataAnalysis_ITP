		<title>19Scalford School</title>
		<content> Scalford School opened in 1844, in a  
 building given by Thomas Webster,     
 which used to be a chapel. In 1866 and
 1874 the school was improved but the  
 most recent change was in 1983 when   
 indoor toilets and a cloakroom were   
 built.                                
  Because this made the back yard so   
 small we have we have worked together 
 with some of our parents to make it in
 to an Activity Area,with places for   
 animals and plants to grow.Now we can 
 work or play outside when it is fine. 
    Though our school once had about   
 100 pupils now there are only 41      
 children from the villages and farms  
 around. We only have 2 teachers,but we
 do lots of activities like art and    
 craft, swimming, science, P.E. and    
 singing. We join with children from   
 other schools for long visits or      
 special activity days.                </content>
