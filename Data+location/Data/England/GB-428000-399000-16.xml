		<title>16Wortley-Sheep Farm</title>
		<content> Home Farm is in the centre of Wortley.
 The same family have rented it for    
 over 70 years. The farmhouse and      
 buildings are very old. At present the
 farm has 3,000 sheep and 3 working    
 dogs. Most of the fields are grazing  
 land for the sheep but 20 acres are   
 used for silage. The farmer also rents
 land on the moors as extra grazing.   
 The busiest time of year is spring    
 when all the lambs are born. If the   
 lambs are small or weak they are kept 
 in the barn and hand fed. In May all  
 the sheep are sheared. The farmer can 
 shear a sheep very quickly. He gets   
 the fleece off in one piece. The sheep
 have to be stamped with the farmer's  
 mark before they are allowed out. They
 also have to be dipped to kill        
 insects. Most of the young lambs are  
 sent to merket to be sold for         
 fattening.                            </content>
