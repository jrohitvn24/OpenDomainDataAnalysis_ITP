		<content> This is a very rural area .There are  
 small residential settlements at      
 Cockshoot and Jack's Green in the     
 N.W.and at The Camp in the N.E.but the
 area is mostly covered by farmland and
 forestry with only a thin scattering  
 of farmhouses and dwellings.Minor     
 roads serve the periphery of this     
 block but no roads pass through its   
 'heart'which is the valley of Dillay  
 Brook.                                
 The brook runs from the N.E.to        
 the S.W.and is joined by several small
 streams.The valley sides are cut      
 steeply into the Cotswold Hills and   
 are mostly forested but the gentle    
 slopes of the valley bottom are used  
 as pasture.                           
 Besides this valley and the head of   
 the Slad Valley(which lies to the     
 N.W.)the land is high and flat-typical
 of Cotswold escarpment dip-slopes.    </content>
