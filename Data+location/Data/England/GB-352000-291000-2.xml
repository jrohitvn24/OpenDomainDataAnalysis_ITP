		<content> The main hamlets in this Domesday     
 block are Stanway,Longville and East  
 Wall.The South Shropshire District    
 Council is not allowing infilling of  
{dwellings. }The only planning         
 applications passed are for change of 
 use of farm buildings for tourism or  
 crafts or an occasional cottage needed
 for a worker.Thus the area has changed
 little over the years.The 2 principal 
 houses are Wilderhope Manor and       
 Stanway Manor,the former is now a     
 youth hostel and the latter remains a 
 private residence.There are 12{       
{farmhouses }of considerable size,the  
 majority of which were in existence   
 before the 1841 tithe map.A number of 
 old {stone cottages}have been extended
 to give extra living space and        
 bathrooms.There were a few {council   
{houses }built in Longville in 1954.
