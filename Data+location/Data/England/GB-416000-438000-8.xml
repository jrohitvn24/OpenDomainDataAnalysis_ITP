		<title>08Mrs P******'s Life</title>
		<content> Mrs P****** is more than 70 years old 
 and has lived in Esholt for most of   
 her life.She went to school there,and 
 her grandfather was in charge of      
 building the sewage works.In her      
 early life she was a telephonist      
 but she is now a voluntary worker at  
 the village institute,which was built 
 in memory of the four men of Esholt   
 who died in the First World War.The   
 institute is now used for part of     
 the time to sell refreshments to the  
 tourists,who come to the village      
 especially on Sundays and             
 Wednesdays.Mrs P****** likes to       
 see the tourists coming, but not too  
 many at once, as they make a lot of   
 extra work for her.She wouldn't like  
 to live anywhere else unless she were 
 forced to move,and then she would want
 to move down south,right away from the
 area.                                 </content>
