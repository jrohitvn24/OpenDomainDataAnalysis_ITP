		<content> Near Plaitford there is a disused     
 gravel pit and sand pit.On the site of
 the sand pit a number of workshops    
 have grown up, and the are still      
 working although the gravel pit isn't.
 Concrete blocks and beams are made    
 here, next to the Wellow pottery.     
 Other workshops have grown up around  
 these, including  a light engineering 
 works, a garden machinery service     
 centre, and a coal merchants. There is
 also a weighbridge to check the loads 
 of lorries entering or leaving the    
 site. Across the road there are two   
 sawmills. One is very small, and the  
 circular saw is driven by a belt form 
 a tractor. It mainly cuts fencing     
 posts for the wooden fencing panels   
 which are made locally. The other     
 sawmill is powered by electricity and 
 makes a wide variety of posts and     
 planks.                               </content>
