		<content>  In{Grayshott}most of the houses are  
 detached but there are some bungalows 
 and a very small number are semi-     
 detached. Most of them have 4         
 bedrooms. The houses are between 10   
 and 30 years old. The most popular    
 fuels are gas and electricity and only
 a very small number use oil.          
  The majority of people have large    
 gardens and many people have a double 
 garage but most still have a single   
 garages. Within the home the vast     
 majority have both a telephone and a  
 colour television. Many have bicycles 
 and video recorders but only a few    
 have either a swimming pool or boats  
 and none have stables. Most people are
 in full time employment, though a few 
 have retired.{London-bound}commuters  
 using the station at{Haslemere}       
 numbered at least a third of those    
 interviewed.                          </content>
