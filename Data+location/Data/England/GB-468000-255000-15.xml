		<content> Anna and Vanessa Murby are twins who  
are aged 14 years. They both attend    
Campion School Bugbrooke and are both  
interested in Music. They live in      
Kislingbury so they go to school by bus
 Both girls are in the County Youth    
Orchestra, at the Music School. They   
rehearse every Saturday. The rehearsal 
fills the whole morning. After this    
they go to another music group         
"Conducting Classes" followed closely  
by a twentieth century music group.    
 Most Saturday Evenings the twins go to
a Concert or are in a Concert. Many of 
these are at the Derngate Northampton. 
 The musical instruments they are      
interested in are :                    
  Piano                                
  Clarinet                             
  Viola
