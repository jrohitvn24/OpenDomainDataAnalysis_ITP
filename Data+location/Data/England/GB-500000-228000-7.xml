		<content>{  BUILDING MATERIALS AND SERVICES     
  {--------------------------------    
 The main building material is brick as
 there is no local stone available.    
        Extensive use has been made of 
 cladding and rendering. Roofing is    
 mainly tile but in parts the original 
 thatch and slate remain. All the main 
 services are available, although some 
 properties still are not connected to 
 the main sewage system.
