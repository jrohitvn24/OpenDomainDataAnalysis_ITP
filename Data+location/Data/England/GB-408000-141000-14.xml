		<title>14POLICE PROTECT STONEHENGE</title>
		<content> During June of this year, the 'Rights 
 of Way' in our area were some of the  
 best protected in the whole country.  
 For over 3,000 police, drawn from     
 forces all over the country, guarded  
 every possible entry to Stonehenge,   
 pathways and tracks were blocked by   
 huge tree stumps or farm machinery,   
 and access was refused in order to    
 stop pop fans getting onto the site.  
 Local farmers, who normally maintain  
 the footpaths for ramblers, willingly 
 co-operated with the Police to stop   
 people camping on farmland and every  
 possible entry point was guarded. All 
 main roads were bollarded off into    
 single line traffic, vehicles were    
 visually checked. Police Transit Vans 
 with radio control acted as a back up,
 and anything suspicious was stopped.  
 Many arrests were made for motoring or
 drug offences.                        </content>
