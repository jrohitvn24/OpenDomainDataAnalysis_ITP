		<content>There are four main nurseries in the   
area:Mosslane(952366),Spot Acre(950373)
,Fulford(949376),Moddershall(925365).  
They are located here for physical and 
economic reasons.The nurseries,despite 
their high elevation(200m average) take
advantage of south facing slopes which 
avoid excessive frost damage by air    
drainage.Economically they are well    
situated for the urban markets of the  
Midlands. The trees grown by the       
majority of the nurseries are used     
by local councils for landscaping      
purposes.The local demand for more     
gardening equipment and plants, has    
increased rapidly in past years        
partly due to more and more leisure    
time available to the working          
population.In the 60's and 70's the    
size and numbers of nurseries          
increased due to the new demand for    
trees for pottery land reclamation.    </content>
