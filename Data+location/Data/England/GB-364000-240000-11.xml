		<title>11'PRIDEWOOD' ASHPERTON</title>
		<content> Pridewood is very much today as always
 been _ mainly hops. Hereford bulls    
 were once breed and shown to a very   
 high standard from the farm. There is 
 a very small non_descript herd there  
 now. The farmhouse is in need of      
 extensive renovation, this is now in  
 hand for this coming year. The new    
 owners have no previous experience in 
 farming _ the farm will be managed by 
 Mr.Cecil Matthews who has been at     
 Pridewood for well over 30 years. Note
 that there were 14 people working on  
 the farm 30 years ago and today it is 
 worked by just 2 people,the only      
 domestic help that is retained is a   
 part time gardener. One of the        
 features of Pridewood is its very     
 interesting garden, there are two     
 unusual trees on the front lawn - a   
 Mulberry and a Weeping Ash. The       
 gardens are to be fully restored.     </content>
