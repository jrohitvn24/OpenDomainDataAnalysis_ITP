		<content> The Electricity Council's Research    
 Centre was established in 1965 to     
 develop electrotechnology by research 
 into new methods of electricity       
 distribution and utilisation. Three   
 quarters of the research is associated
 with the use of electricity especially
 in industry the rest with distribution
 by reducing equipment and operating   
 costs &amp; improving reliability &amp; fault 
 detection. New processes, developed   
 here are offered to industry via      
 licensing agreements &amp; currently there
 are over 40 of these ranging from     
 electrochemical products &amp; processes, 
 effluent treatment &amp; materials        
 recycling, through industrial heating,
 drying &amp; processing (including the    
 continuous heating of foodstuffs by   
 ohmic heating) to metals technology   
 &amp; Environmental Engineering (eg.energy
 efficient house designs)              </content>
