		<title>09NEW IBSTOCK SURGERY _ 1</title>
		<content>   The new doctors' surgery,{Ibstock   
{House,}was opened in February, 1985.  
 It was built on High Street in less   
 than a year at a cost of Â£220,000 and 
 will be paid for by the four doctors  
 who own the practice.                 
   Designed by a Leicester firm of     
 architects, it was built to replace   
 the old surgery in Overton Road which 
 was cold, damp, dark and cramped.     
   The new surgery has ten times as    
 much floor space as the old building. 
 Each doctor has a separate consulting 
 room and other facilities include a   
 common room, treatment room (used by  
 the district nurse), reception area   
 and storage areas.                    
   Both doctors and patients are very  
 enthusiastic about their spacious new 
 surgery.
