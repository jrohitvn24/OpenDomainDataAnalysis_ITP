		<title>01COLN VALLEY :INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> This area is part of the Cotswold     
 region which consists of an undulating
 tableland with winding streams which  
 have cut deep into the land. The wolds
 are windswept and exposed with few    
 houses to be seen. Fields are divided 
 by walls of loose stone, and excellent
 crops of wheat and barley are grown.  
 Every 5 years the crops are           
 discontinued and the fields used for  
 sheep pasture. Down in the Coln valley
 are rich water meadows and grazing for
 sheep and cattle. The picturesque     
 villages sheltering here are built    
 from the local oolitic limestone which
 mellows naturally and whose roofs     
 become covered with lichen and moss.  
 The whole district is a conservation  
 area and attracts a large number of   
 tourists. The main villages are Coln  
 Rogers, Winson and Ablington.
