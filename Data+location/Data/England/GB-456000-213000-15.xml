		<title>15CHARLTON-ON-OTMOOR CHURCH</title>
		<content>The name of our Church is St.Mary's.In 
the porch is a small stained glass     
window of St.George slaying the Dragon.
The Church is built in the shape of a  
cross.It has recently had a new        
pinnacle on the Church Tower because   
lighting struck the old one.The church 
is about 700yrs old.In the churchyard  
are the remains of a 13th century      
cross.The proudest possession of the   
church is the late 15th century        
screen.On May the 1st each year a great
cross of flowers and evergreens is     
placed on top of the screen.The screen 
is hand painted.A long May Garland is  
hung on the screen on May Day.This is  
made of hoops and rope covered with    
evergreens and flowers.Some of the     
pillars have the remains of paintings  
on them.There is an old brass near the 
Alter.
