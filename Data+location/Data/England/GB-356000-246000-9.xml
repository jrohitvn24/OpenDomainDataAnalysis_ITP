		<title>09Dairy Farming in Felton Area</title>
		<content> There is a strong representation of   
 dairying in this area.  There are     
 seven herds ranging from two very     
 large units (one of over 300 cows) to 
 six cows on a small holding.  Apart   
 from one herd of Ayreshires, black and
 white cattle (Holstein and Friesians) 
 are the predominant breed.  Milk goes 
 to a local dairy producing            
 concentrated crumb for a chocolate    
 factory, and is collected daily by    
 tanker.  The cows are summer grazed   
 and are fed on silage in winter.  Only
 a small amount of hay is made.        
 Concentrated cattle cake is fed       
 according to milk yield.  Most cattle 
 are winter housed in cubicles, with   
 some in covered yards.  The larger    
 herds are milked in herring-bone      
 parlours.  Most herds are milked twice
 daily, but one herd is milked three   
 times.                                </content>
