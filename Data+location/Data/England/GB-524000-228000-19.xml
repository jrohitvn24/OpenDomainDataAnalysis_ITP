		<title>19SCHOOLBOY LIFE IN 1985</title>
		<content> My name is{Jon-Paul Griffiths.}I am   
{eleven years old}and I go to Weston   
 JMI School, Hertfordshire. My day     
 begins at 07:00 when I get up and     
 go downstairs for a{breakfast}of Coco 
 Pops, my favourite rice based cereal  
 in cocoa powder, which I have with    
 milk. I usually watch Breakfast Time  
{television.}At about 07:40, I wash,   
 clean my teeth, dress for school and  
 then watch more television until 08.30
 when I leave the{house}.I{walk}from   
 home and arrive at about 08.55 when   
 the whistle is blown by a teacher on  
 duty and I go in. Our class{timetable 
 starts with mathematics and assembly  
 each day. On somedays the Vicar takes 
{assembly}and we have hymn practise on 
 Thursdays. Our{morning lessons}are    
 usually formal Maths and English both 
 before and after{break}which is at    
 10.30. I often have a drink and snack.</content>
