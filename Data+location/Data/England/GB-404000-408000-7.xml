 All three reservoirs in the Wessenden 
 Valley chain were constructed by      
 using earth dams not concrete ones.   
 This reflects their age, 1839 to 1907.
 It is also interesting to note that   
 the overflow and overflow portal from 
 Butterley Reservoir are listed        
 buildings.                            
  Butterley reservoir also has a       
 pumping station so that water can be  
 sent along a catchment system to Deer 
 Hill Reservoir. There is also another 
 catchment system in this area to send 
 water by gravity from Wessenden Head  
 Reservoir to top up both Deer Hill    
 and Blackmoorfoot Reservoirs.  Both   
 these catchments follow the hillside  
 round Binn Moor.
