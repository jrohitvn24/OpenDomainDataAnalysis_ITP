		<title>16A DAY IN THE LIFE OF CLAIRE</title>
		<content> I woke up at 6am and got dressed then 
 I went to have breakfast.After        
 breakfast my Dad and I went to church.
 We are Catholics and have to travel   
 ten miles to our church.Then we went  
 for a walk.We returned home at 9am.I  
 went to empty the bin.Then I helped to
 do the washing up.In the afternoon my 
 family went swimming in Shrewsbury    
 baths four miles away.I went home with
 my family for tea.It was fish and     
 chips.After tea I went to Brownies    
 which meet in my local Primary school.
 At Brownies we went for a nature walk 
 round the village.I found a           
 caterpillar.                          
 We went back to the school and played 
 some games.Then I went home.I watched 
 television until 8.30pm when I  went  
 to bed.
