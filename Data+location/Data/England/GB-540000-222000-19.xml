   In this area there is a complete    
 telephone system with almost every    
 house having a telephone in common    
 with most of Great Britain.           
                                       
   Near Pelham , which is just outside 
 our area there is an electricity      
 sub-station which supplies electricity
 to our area.                          
                                       
   In our area there is Stane Street   
 which is a very famous old Roman road.
                                       
   In common with other Roman roads it 
 is very straight and runs from Horse  
 Cross, in the centre of our area, to  
 Cradle end, which is outside our area.
