		<title>01THE SANDLINGS, GENERALLY</title>
		<content> The Sandlings is a part of East Anglia
 lying between the Ipswich-Lowestoft   
 road and the coast, originally heath- 
 land. Evidence shows that prehistoric 
 man existed here; today, with one ex- 
 ception it remains sparsely populated.
 Major developments have changed the   
 landscape. The Forestry Commission, in
 1920, started planting, aiming to pro-
 vide employment by producing softwood,
 and the RAF airfield,built in 1942, is
 still in use, now by the US Air Force 
 (USAF), Woodbridge Base, as part of   
 NATO's defence system.  Airmen and    
 their families living at the base form
 the one community.  Other land is     
 farmed, with root crops, cereals, and 
 some stock. Apart from the sensitive  
 defence area, the public are able to  
 enjoy walking freely through a        
 district rich in wildlife.
