		<title>06    Palm Bay Estate</title>
		<content>    With one interuption for the war   
 the Palm Bay Estate has continued to  
 grow eastward from Cornwall Gardens   
 across Thanet farmland to Botany Road.
 The pre-war estate was of grass       
 bordered straight line roads, but the 
 last thirty years has given a complete
 pattern ofcurving avenues and         
 cue-de-sacs. A maze to the unwary     
 visitor.                              
    There seems to be a shortage of    
 trees and the estate is open to the   
 bitterly cold winds of winter. Access 
 to the beach in summer has maintained 
 the popularity of the area to home    
 buyers.                               
    Most shopping must be done by car  
 but a small terrace of shops provides 
 the essentials. A library has been    
 built in Northdown Park but the       
 primary school is much further away by
 the Millmead estate.                  </content>
