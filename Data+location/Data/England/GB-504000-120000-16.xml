		<title>16BEEDINGS HOUSE, PULBOROUGH</title>
		<content>  At the highest point of the eastern  
 end of the ridge, some 300 feet above 
 sea level, stands a large four storey 
 house called Beedings. This house of  
 75 rooms was built in the early 1900s 
 by a Dr Harley who practised in       
 London.                               
  Dr Harley was reputed to be obsessed 
 with the danger of fire; the          
 construction of the building was of   
 stone and instead of timber floors,   
 concrete was placed on rolled steel   
 joists one yard apart.                
  The house was also known locally as  
 Harleys Castle or Iron Castle.        
  Dr Harley was an enthusiast for trees
 and the 10 acres of grounds were      
 planted with rhododendrons, azaleas,  
 monkey puzzle trees and several pines.
  The Canadian Army occupied the house 
 during the war. The present owner     
 converted it into 7 flats in 1976.    </content>
