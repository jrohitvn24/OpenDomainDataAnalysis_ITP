		<content> In addition to B.&amp; B., holiday homes  
 and the youth hostel, the Mortal Man  
 hotel and the Queen's Head inn also   
 provide accomodation for visitors. Not
 only is the village itself laced with 
 small lanes and paths, so are the     
 surrounding fellsides. From the       
 village, Ambleside can be reached by  
 the 'Hundreds' road, a popular track  
 following the lower slopes of Wansfell
 and giving fine views over the lake,  
 or by 'Nanny Lane' which goes over    
 Wansfell Pike. A well-used track      
 follows the valley floor before       
 climbing steadily northwards to 'High 
 Street'(825m.). On the east side of   
 the valley, the old drove road leads  
 over Garburn Pass to Kentmere.        
 Tourist traffic on the main road      
 towards the Kirkstone Pass is often   
 slow moving behind coaches and        
 caravans. Winter is comparative bliss!</content>
