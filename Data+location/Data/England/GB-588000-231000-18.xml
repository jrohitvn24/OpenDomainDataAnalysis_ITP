		<title>18Recreation  Breeding Dogs</title>
		<content>    When we visited the dairy farmer we
 also talked to his wife. We discovered
 that she bred dogs for showing at dog 
 shows. We walked into her living room 
 and there in the corner was a large,  
 glass fronted cupboard full of cups,  
 rosettes and certificates which her   
 dogs had won for her.                 
    The type of dog is called          
 Griffon Bruxellois which comes from   
 Brussels. They weigh up to 4.5 Kg     
 and are coloured red, black or black  
 and tan. One year one of her dogs won 
 the best of breed award at Crufts. She
 was very proud of her animals.
