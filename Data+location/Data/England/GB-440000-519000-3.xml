		<content>   My road is boring,there is no where 
 to play.I like the house we are living
 in but the road is so small.I wish the
 field was still open at the top so we 
 can play on the bars and if we weren't
 in the road my sister would know where
 to find me.We play in the road but on 
 a night when the cars return it is    
 full and there is no where to play.   
 There are some naggy people in our    
 road and people tell us to go and play
 up our own end and get away from their
 car.There is a lady called Jenny and  
 one time when Vicki fell off her bike 
 out side of her house she said,"Stop  
 staring at me I havent got four       
 wheels," and we weren't looking at    
 her.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
