		<title>10GEORGINA'S DIARY.</title>
		<content>  During the week I get up about 7.45. 
 I get dressed and go downstairs to    
 breakfast then I go back upstairs and 
 wash my teeth and face. I get my      
 school bag and on Monday, Wednesday   
 and Friday I ride my bike to school in
 the summer and some of the Autumn and 
 Spring with my friend. But on Tuesdays
 I go to music from 4 o'clock to 5     
 o'clock.On Thursdays I go swimming    
 after school.                         
  The school bell goes at 9 o'clock in 
 the morning and we leave school at    
 half past three. After school         
 sometimes I go horse riding.I have got
 my own horse and my mum owns a riding 
 school. We keep the horses in the     
 stables and on the floor we put straw.
 We give them hay and some food to eat,
 the food is called sugarbeet, bran and
 barley.We usually turn the horses out 
 in the field for the night.           </content>
