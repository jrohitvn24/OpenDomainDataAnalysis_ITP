		<title>15The New A30 Road</title>
		<content> The new A30 dual-carriageway was built
 in the 1970's. The people in Cheriton 
 Bishop made a new Dabby Lane because  
 the A30 went right through the old    
 Dabby Lane. It went right through our 
 farmland and spoilt it. It was built  
 because Cheriton Bishop was getting   
 too busy, especially in the summer    
 holiday times. Thousands of cars,     
 lorries and caravans passed through   
 the village on their way to and from  
 Cornwall. The old road was very       
 dangerous for us to cross. The new    
 road passes below my house and in the 
 winter the snow blocks it at Whiddon  
 Down nearby.
