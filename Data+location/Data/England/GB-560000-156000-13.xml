		<title>13HOUSING IN PLATT.</title>
		<content>   When surveying housing in the area  
we found some areas of old housing but 
most of it was built at least since the
second world war and many between 1965 
and 1985. Most people live in houses   
that are either detached or            
semi-detached like the one described by
Katie below.                           
   My house is semi-detached. It has 10
rooms,4 of them bedrooms. One bedroom  
is a spare room and we put things in   
there. The kitchen is quite small and  
wehave many labour saving devices such 
as a dishwasher, electric cooker and   
refrigerator.                          
   Our front room is big and we have a 
television, radio and stereo. Our      
dining room is where we eat and when it
is sunny we sit in there. My bedroom is
quite big but not as big as my         
brother's. We have a utility room where
my mother does the washing and ironing.</content>
