		<content>   {Gatton Park}is famous as having    
 been one of the "Rotten Boroughs" and 
 was entitled to send two members to   
 Parliament, but by l830 had only 7    
 electors.  There is a small "Town     
 Hall" still standing  in the grounds. 
                                       
    Many{famous people}have owned      
 Gatton including Sir Jeremiah Colman, 
 the well known mustard manufacturer.  
 During the Second World War the hall  
 was used to billet Canadian Soldiers. 
                                       
    There was once an orphanage at     
 Gatton Hall but since l955 it has been
 used as a {school,}known as the Royal 
 Alexandra and Albert School.  It is a 
 boarding school for 532 children, many
 of whom come from service families.
