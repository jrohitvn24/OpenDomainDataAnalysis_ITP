		<content>   South Washington is an area of new  
 housing and industrial development    
 mixed with patches of deciduous       
{woodland}containing ash,birch,plane   
 and sycamore trees. The disused       
 railway tracks now support common{wild
{flowers,}elder and hawthorn bushes.   
 Both regions provide homes for        
 hedgehogs and rabbits and many other  
{small mammals,}while these in their   
 turn are food for the kestrels which  
 can often be seen hovering above the  
 fields.                               
   Rooks,crows,jackdaws,gulls,         
 wagtails,sparrows and starlings are   
 common. Pheasants from the Lambton    
 Estate are seen on the roads in the   
 breeding season.Walks and parks now   
 exist on both banks of the river and  
 the eggs of water birds from the      
{Washington Wildfowl Park}can be found.
