		<title>05A VISIT TO HORTON COURT</title>
		<content>    On Wednesday we went to Horton     
 Court which belongs to the National   
 Trust.The National Trust is a society 
 of people who are given money to      
 preserve and restore old buildings.We 
 went into the Norman Hall and we saw a
 bearskin rug in front of a big fire   
 place.We were shown a long table which
 was just one piece of wood standing on
 four very short legs.On the table were
 six pewter plates with patterns on    
 them.On another table was some armour 
 which dated from Oliver Cromwell's    
 time.                                 
    Then we went outside and saw the   
 ambulatory where ladies used to walk  
 up and down when it rained.We then    
 walked down to the rose garden where  
 we met two people who had come from   
 Newcastle.They said they loved looking
 at interesting places and were going  
 on to Cirencester.Alex,James,Katherine</content>
