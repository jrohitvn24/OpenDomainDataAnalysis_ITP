		<content> Iford House                           
 Iford House was built in 1795 by Dr   
 William Dale Farr, purchaser of part  
 of the Westover Hundred; the house was
 then spoken of as Iford Manor and Dr  
 Farr as "the Squire of Iford".He was  
 the freeholder of land reaching       
 from Iford to what is now the position
 of the Central Station,  Bournemouth. 
                                       
 Stourfield House                      
 In 1844 Stourfield House was bought by
 Admiral William Charles Popham in     
 whose family it remained until the    
 estate was broken up in 1893.         
 Stourfield House is now part of the   
 Douglas House Sanatorium in Southboune
 Road.
