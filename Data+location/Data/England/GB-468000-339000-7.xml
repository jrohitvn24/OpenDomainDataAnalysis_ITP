		<title>07BINGHAM MARKET</title>
		<content>    The market is held every Thursday  
 with the stalls set up around the     
 Buttercross which is in the centre of 
 the square of Bingham.On average 50 or
 so traders attend each week and a     
 minimum rent of Â£5 is paid to the     
 Rushcliffe Borough Council for each   
 stall.                                
    The market attracts hundreds of    
 people from Bingham and the outlying  
 villages. There is a great variety of 
 goods to be bought and the shopkeepers
 of Bingham welcome the trade it also  
 attracts for them.                    
    Although it is only a small market 
 compared to those of Nottingham,      
 Newark and Grantham, it is always busy
 and special buses are put into service
 on Thursdays for the convenience of   
 all.
