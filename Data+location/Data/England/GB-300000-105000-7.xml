		<content>   There are 20 people stationed in    
 Cullompton in this force.Most of their
 time is spent watching for speeding   
 motorists and drunk_driving.If they   
 are informed by Exeter that a car has 
 been stolen or a crime committed they 
 watch the motorway from bridges or    
 observation points.They are called to 
 accidents and carry first_aid         
 kits.Motorway telephones are one mile 
 apart.If it is a minor crash and      
 no_one is hurt they put you in touch  
 with motor organisations.There are    
 numbered posts along the motorway and 
 arrows to the nearest phone box.When  
 the police know the numbers they can  
 arrive more quickly.                  
   They work in cars,Range_Rovers and  
 on motor cycles.They work eight hour  
 shifts and in pairs.They patrol from{ 
{Exeter}to{Taunton}using Cullompton's  
 access roads.                         </content>
