		<content> This shop is a Grocery and General    
 Stores and an Off Licence.It re-opened
 in 1984 after being closed down for a 
 while.Mrs Willett is their best       
 customer.She is also our dinner lady  
 at Steeple Bumpstead School.Five      
 people work in the shop. Their        
 best-selling sweet is Mars Bar, and   
 their most popular ice-cream is Feast.
 The frozen food most in demand is Peas
 and the most purchased vegetable is   
 Potatoes.Their busiest days are       
 Wednesdays and Fridays.Their stock    
 comes from Sudbury, Cambridge,        
 Chelmsford, Castle Camps.We asked     
 people why they thought a village shop
 was useful and we found out that the  
 people who appreciate it are old      
 people and people who have not got    
 cars. We like the people because they 
 are friendly and they know us.
