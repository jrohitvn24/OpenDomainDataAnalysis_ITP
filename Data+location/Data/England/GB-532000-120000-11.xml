		<title>11Wivelsfield - Farming (1)</title>
		<content> Although Wivelsfield is an area of    
{mixed farming,}the majority of the    
 land is under cultivation.            
                                       
 Intensively managed grassland, both   
 for pasture and for cutting as hay and
 silage, covers the most acreage.      
                                       
 Other crops grown are Winter and      
 Spring Barley, Winter Wheat, Field    
 Beans, Potatoes and Oats. Some of the 
 crops are used to supplement livestock
 feed. Potatoes are often sold at the  
 farms.                                
                                       
 The fields are small to medium, some  
 with hedgerows, but there are no large
 'Prairie' type fields.                
                                       
 Almost all of the farms in the area   
 have retained some woodland both      
 coniferous and deciduous.             </content>
