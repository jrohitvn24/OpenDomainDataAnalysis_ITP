		<content> There are some{28 shops}in the village
 covering most essential domestic      
 requirements. The 'Co-op' is the only 
 national chain store in the village.  
 It has a wines and spirits licence and
 sells a wide range of goods and       
 groceries. The other shops are all    
{privately owned,}many being long      
 established family businesses such as 
 the Berrycroft and Milberry Stores.   
 Newer enterprises include an art      
 gallery and a shoe shop.              
 Although the village can supply most  
 local needs yet many people prefer to 
 go to Bar Hill or Cambridge where     
 there are large supermarkets.         
 Vegetables and fruit in season can be 
 bought quite cheaply at the side of   
 the road and many local growers{sell  
{direct}to the public.                 
 The village has 2 banks, 3 garages and
 a post office.                        </content>
