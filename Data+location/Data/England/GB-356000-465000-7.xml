		<title>07BRADES FARM:Farming Changes</title>
		<content>During Mr Towers lifetime farming has  
become more intensive.Farmers now need 
to be more business-like and more tech-
nical.Mr Towers learned farming through
experience but one of his four sons    
attends agricultural college and two   
others have done so then gained experi-
nce on other farms before returning to 
work at home.One specialises as a cow- 
man and the other deals with sheep and 
marketing.One other person is employed 
on the farm.Mr Towers has doubled his  
stock,uses less labour and more machin-
ery.He buys a lot more feed and fertil-
iser.He hopes to build a new computeri-
sed herring bone milking parlour to re-
place the rotary parlour.It will need  
only one man instead of two.He expects 
his cattle to stay inside longer.He ho-
pes to employ more men so a shorter    
week can be established.As a family co-
ncern members work longer hours.       </content>
