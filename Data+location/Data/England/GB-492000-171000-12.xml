		<title>12THE FARM LABOURER'S DAY</title>
		<content> The farm labourer's day begins at 7.30
 when he jumps on his tractor and goes 
 to check his 126 Ayrshire and Jersey  
 heifers, "his young stock" as he calls
 them, for which he is responsible. He 
 must check them for disease,          
 especially of the feet. During the    
 winter, when the cows are in their    
 stalls, he has to clean them out every
 other day. In summer he has time to   
 help with other farming jobs like     
 making silage. He finishes work about 
 4.30 and spends most evenings         
 "watching the box". Every other       
 weekend is free to visit his holiday  
 home in Sussex and he has four weeks  
 holiday a year. Sometimes he goes to a
 party given by the Queen for her      
 employees. He might be either at      
 Windsor Castle or Buckingham Palace.
