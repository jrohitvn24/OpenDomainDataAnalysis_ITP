		<content> Many of the{houses}are part of the    
 estate owned by{Lord Harlech.}They    
 were built to accommodate estate      
 workers employed at Brogyntyn, the    
 seat of the Harlech family. Local     
 building materials including stone    
 for walls and slate for the roofs     
 are commonly found. As such the       
 dwellings blend into the countryside. 
 Very few{modern}buildings occur, so   
 bricks and tiles are rarely to be     
 seen. Many cottages no longer used for
 agricultural workers have been bought 
 by young couples for{restoration}and  
{modernisation.}Some have extended     
 their dwellings. Most houses have     
 large gardens and are spaced out.     
 Central heating and modern            
 appliances have frequently been       
 added to the older cottages.
