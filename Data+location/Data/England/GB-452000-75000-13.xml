		<content> The loss of some notable buildings    
{i.e.The Royal National Hospital for   
{Diseases of the Chest and Steephill   
{Castle,}altered the area and so also  
 did the closure in 1957 of the{railway
{line}which used to run along the      
 'Undercliff'.This was considered to be
 a great loss to the district as it was
 one of the most delightful train      
 journeys on the Island.               
{Smuggling and Smuggler's rings}have   
 long been associated with the area and
 the{Smuggler's Museum}in the grounds  
 of the Botanical Gardens has          
 underground vaults illustrating 700   
 years of smuggling.                   
 There are plans to open a{Heritage    
{Centre}in Ventnor next year depicting 
 various aspects of fishing and the    
 History of the Blake Family and the   
 'Undercliff'.
