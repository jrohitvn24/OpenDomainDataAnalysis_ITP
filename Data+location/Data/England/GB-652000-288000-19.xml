		<title>19RELICS OF WORLD WAR II</title>
		<content>During {World War II} the coast of East
Anglia was vulnerable to enemy attack  
and, to guard against this possibility 
a variety of defences were erected.    
Evidence of this can been seen in our  
area. The remains of anti-invasion     
obstructions are under the sea in grid 
squares 53 88 and 53 89. They often    
foul the gear of longshore boats. On   
the cliff at 537 888 can be seen the   
concrete remains of the coastal defence
battery of heavy guns installed during 
the war. At 536 874 are the concrete   
plinths of anti-aircraft gun mountings.
At various places in the area can be   
seen concrete and brick pillboxes which
served as machine gun and observation  
posts as well as large pre-formed      
concrete blocks which were used as     
anti-tank obstructions. The rifle range
at 53 89 was constructed before the    
war.It is W.D. property and still used </content>
