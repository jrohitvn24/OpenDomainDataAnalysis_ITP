		<title>17Our Day at St.Levan</title>
		<content> On Thursday 11th of July we went to   
 St.Levan for our last Domesday outing.
 We parked our things at St.Levan      
 school and set off.                   
 The thing I remember is when we went  
 to this house.                        
 We knocked on the door but there was  
 no one in so we looked around the     
 garden which was very big.            
 We saw very big leaves which we called
 Giant rhubarb and we were using them  
 as fans. We also saw a river with fish
 in it called Trout so we watched them 
 for a while.                          
 We thought the garden was fascinating 
 and a bit like a jungle .             
 Five minutes later a lady came when   
 we were just about to go. We asked her
 our questions and she answered all of 
 them.She said"Would you like to see   
 a watermill?".
