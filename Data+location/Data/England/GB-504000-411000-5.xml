 SUGAR BEET                            
 Most of the farms grow sugar beet     
 which is grown under contract for     
 British Sugar. The nearest factory is 
 at Brigg. Two of the farmers share a  
 sugar beet harvester with a neighbour.
 POTATOES                              
 Some of these are grown under contract
 for the food processing market        
 (e.g.frozen foods), and some for the  
 ware market. The potatoes are mostly  
 stored and sold throughout the winter;
 a few are exported.                   
 PEAS                                  
 All the farms grow peas.The farmers   
 are members of farming co_operatives  
 which sell the peas under contract to 
 a major food processor for freezing   
 Frozen peas are also exported.
