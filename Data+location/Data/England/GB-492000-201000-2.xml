		<title>02Houses</title>
		<content>  Our block has many varieties of      
buildings. Many houses are made of the 
brick that is made in Bellingdon. There
are also many flint cottages in the    
country areas. In Chesham you would see
mostly small Victorian style buildings.
 Roofs are now usually slated although 
some houses have thick tiles instead.  
 The oldest buildings are the churches 
but the oldest house is in Church      
Street and dates from 1642. The area   
with the most modern houses is on the  
Hivings Estate to the north-east of our
block. These areas are mostly          
council houses although some  of       
have been bought and done up.Some      
 houses have cellars. Some walls       
are pebbledashed and some are tiled.   
There are no elaborate chimneys but our
speciality is gateways.We have         
an average of 11 rooms per house and   
most of us have garages.               </content>
