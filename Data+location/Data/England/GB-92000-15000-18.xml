		<title>18WHY PEOPLE LIKE ST.MARTINS.</title>
		<content>    We have interviewed some people who
 have lived here all their lives,also  
 people who were born here but went    
 away and have now come back.We spoke  
 to some people who have been coming   
 here on holiday for many years,and we 
 have come to the conclusion that      
 people like it because of the beauty  
 and peace.It is so unlike the         
 mainland.Some people like it here     
 because it is a small community,where 
 everybody knows and cares for each    
 other.                                
   As children we like living on an    
 island because we can go swimming     
 nearly every day in the summer.Also we
 enjoy the freedom to wander safely,   
 ride our bikes and go rock climbing.  
 Even in summer the beaches are not    
 crowded so we can enjoy barbecues and 
 picnics.We like to play with children 
 from the mainland when they are here. </content>
