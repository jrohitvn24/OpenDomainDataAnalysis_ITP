		<title>10A Typical Farm</title>
		<content> We looked at each of the questionaires
 we had received from the farmers in   
 our village and discussed what would  
 be a typical farm.We then chose a farm
 which we thought was the closest to   
 the typical farm. This has{320 acres  
 of land and needs{3 regular and some  
{seasonal workers}to look after it.    
 Like many of the farms in the area the
 land is used for both{grazing}and     
 cultivated{crops}and is partly owned  
 by the farmer and the local landowner.
{Beef cattle}are kept until they are 2 
 years old, when they are sold for     
 slaughter. Numbers vary from 120 to   
 160 head. A few{ewes}are also kept,   
 about 6 to 10 in number. The main     
{crops}grown are the cereal crops:     
 wheat, oats and barley covering a     
 total of 160 acres. Other crops are:  
 potatoes,(16 acres),brassicas (10     
 acres) and stick beans,(1/2 acre).    </content>
