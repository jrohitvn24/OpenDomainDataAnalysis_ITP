  In 1956 the Ebenezer Bradwell Trust  
 was set up to use the money that      
 Ebenezer Bradwell, a local Methodist  
 Preacher, had left to help people in  
 need in a three and a half mile radius
 of the Bradwell Parish Church. The sum
 he left was invested and the interest 
 used. The trust members meet about six
 times a year to provide gifts of food,
 flowers and occasionally money to     
 people who have had accidents, are ill
 or have had upsetting experiences.    
      ELIAS MARSHALL CHARITY           
     This trust uses money from the    
 rent of two fields left by Elias      
 Marshall to purchase books for        
 children in Bradwell Infant and Junior
 schools. Originally the money was used
 to pay for the education of Bradwell  
 children whose parents could not      
 afford to pay themselves.             </content>
