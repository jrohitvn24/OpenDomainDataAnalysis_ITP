		<title>13PLAISTOW GENERAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>{Plaistow is an old Sussex village}with
 a church, a chapel, a village hall and
 two pubs, one of which was a coach    
 stop and is 400 years old. There is a 
 village store, post office and garage 
 to serve a population of approximately
 500 - 600. Many of the houses are 400 
 years old. The manor house was the    
 main farm but is now a residence,     
 preserving the old farm buildings.    
 Nestled at the east of the village is 
 a{council estate of 30 houses and 12  
{flats.}Plaistow's attraction is the   
 unspoilt quaintness of the old houses 
 and cottages restored to today's      
 living but retaining their{rural and  
{traditional features.                 
                                       
{Plaistow is surrounded by farms,}7 of 
 which the children surveyed for land  
 use.                                  
                                       </content>
