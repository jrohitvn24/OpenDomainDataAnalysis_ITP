		<title>11MUNDESLEY</title>
		<content>  Mundesley is the largest of the      
 costal resorts in the Erpingham       
 District of Norfolk _ it has a        
 population of about 2000. There are   
 lots of facilities for the visitors   
 who come to enjoy the lovely sands,   
 where bathing, boating and fishing can
 be enjoyed. In the Coronation Hall,   
 Mundesley possesses an excellent      
 centre for entertainments, the many   
 village societies and public meetings.
 Mundesley is celebrated for its       
 bracing healthy climate, and is well  
 provided with hotels, guest houses,   
 chalets and appartments for the       
 accommodation of visitors.            
   The loss of the railway was a major 
 blow to Mundesley, but the building,  
 in the late seventies of the nearby   
 Bacton Gas Site has assured prosperity
 for the village.
