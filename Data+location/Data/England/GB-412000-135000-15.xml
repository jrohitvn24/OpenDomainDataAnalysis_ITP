		<title>15THE RIVER AVON AT WOODFORD</title>
		<content>   The{River Avon}is fifty to sixty    
 miles long and about ten yards wide.  
 It is a{chalk}stream; it rises in     
 chalk but is not a very good example  
 of one. It rises in the Pewsey Vale   
 and flows almost due south entering   
 the sea at Christchurch. The river is 
 very rich in growth.{Birds}and{fish}  
 breed well. There is abundant{plant}  
{life.}The river becomes polluted when 
 farmers use fertilizer and chemicals, 
 which also make the rushes and reeds  
 grow more quickly. The level of the   
 river is lower than it used to be.    
   The fish in the river are mainly    
 trout and grayling, a few salmon and  
 other fresh water fish. When there are
 too many fish they stun them by       
 putting an electric current through   
 the river.                            
   Altogether this is a beatiful       
 peaceful river.                       </content>
