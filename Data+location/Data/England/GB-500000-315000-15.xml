		<title>15SHOPPING</title>
		<content> The only shop we have in our block is 
{Careby Post Office}which also sells   
 stationery, sweets and cigarettes.    
 The two small shops in Little Bytham  
 (actually just outside our block) are 
 almost 2 kilometres from Careby.      
  To supplement these, there are       
 various{travelling vans.}A butcher    
 calls twice a week, a baker three     
 times a week and Little Bytham has a  
 mobile shop once a week. The fish and 
 chip van visits the villages on a     
 Tuesday evening.                      
{ Deliveries}of newspapers and post are
 made every day except Sunday. Little  
 Bytham has two milk rounds.           
  Most people do their main shopping in
 the nearby towns of Stamford and      
 Bourne about 11km away. Grantham is   
 about 26km away, Peterborough about   
 30km. Though Stamford and Grantham are
 on a bus route, it is very limited.   </content>
