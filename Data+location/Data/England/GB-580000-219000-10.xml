		<title>10CARE AND CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> In 1930 it was proposed to make a     
 conservation area around the original 
 garden village built,1926_1930.This   
 was to preserve both the historic     
 value to town planning of The Garden  
 City concept and the early'modern     
 movement'architecture.Most of the     
 village remained unaltered until 1980 
 when tennants were granted buying     
 rights.The conservation area is to    
 guard against unwanted changes and was
 accepted by a majority vote,but much  
 heated controversy followed.Some home 
 owners are annoyed that approval is   
 still needed for any alterations,new  
 windows and colour wash.The council   
 tennants however,seem happy with the  
 situation and their houses are being  
 modernised.A school survey decided    
 that play areas,the park and shops had
 too much litter.More bins are needed, 
 placed at lower levels for children.  </content>
