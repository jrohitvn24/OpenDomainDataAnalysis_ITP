		<title>13  THE VILLAGE POLICEWOMAN</title>
		<content> The village policewoman has been in   
 the village of Shorne for three and a 
 half years. Her job is very different 
 to that of a town policewoman. She    
 rides around the area on a motorbike  
 but can also be seen walking around   
 the village. She is well known by all 
 the people of the village and often   
 her job is more like a community      
 worker. Very rarely do any major      
 crimes happen in the area but she is  
 often involved in the policing of     
 Gravesend.                            
  She often gets called out in the     
 middle of the night to deal with road 
 accidents or suspected prowlers. She  
 prefers working in a village to a town
 as she can get involved in the        
 community and get to know the people  
 whose life and property she protects.
