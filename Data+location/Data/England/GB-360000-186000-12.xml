		<content> My name is Shersden Miller. My day    
 starts at about 7am when I get up. I  
 wash and change by 8am then have      
 breakfast. After breakfast I set off  
 for school at about quarter to nine. I
 start school at 9am. After            
 registration there is a short assembly
 in the school hall. On returning to   
 class I do Maths and English. Break is
 at 1O.3Oam for quarter of an hour and 
 lunch at 12 until quarter past one. I 
 do not have school dinners I bring my 
 own sandwiches. During the afternoon I
 might do some lessons in History ,    
 Geography ,P.E. ,Art or Craft. School 
 finishes at 3.3Opm. I walk home and on
 a fine day I go to play with friends. 
 I have tea between 5 and 6. I then    
 play with my sister, read or watch    
 television before going to bed at     
 quarter past nine.
