		<content> There used to be several pubs in      
 Corston,but now there is only         
 one,{"The Radnor Arms,"}named after   
 the{Earls of Radnor}who  used to be   
 important landowners in the area.The  
 building has been a pub for at least  
 400yrs;there are lots of old stables  
 in the yard at the back. The present  
 landlords are{Mr and Mrs Rudman.}They 
 have been there for three years and   
 enjoy their job,most of the time!They 
 do not own the pub,but are tenants for
 the{Whitbread brewery.}Most of their  
 customers are not locals, but people  
 passing through the village on the    
 main road.They are particularly busy  
 at lunch times.They haven't changed   
 the pub very much,although they have  
 made the two small bars into one large
 one.
