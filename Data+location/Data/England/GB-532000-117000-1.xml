		<content>  The{east side}of Burgess Hill is     
 taken up by the{Folders Lane Estate   
 and the{Inholmes Estate,}both of which
 are new.                              
  There are three schools in the area. 
 They are{Birchwood Grove Primary      
{School, Newick House Special School}  
 and{Manor Field Primary School.}      
{ The Keymer Tile Company}has been     
 going for one hundred years. Because  
 of the brick and tile industry,       
 Burgess Hill became a town.{          
  There are many farms in east Burgess 
 Hill. Much of the land is rough       
 pasture. There are some fields of     
 crops near Streat.                    
  On the edge of{Ditchling Common}there
 is a small vineyard. Part of the      
 Common is a Country Park.
