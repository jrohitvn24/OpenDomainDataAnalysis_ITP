{Not only are there a number of        
{interesting animals but also the      
{tracks and paths over the hills       
{provide excellent vantage points to   
{view wildlife.                        
{                                      
{As the walker steps out across the    
{downs, it is quite possible that a    
{buzzard may be soaring above him.  Roe
{deer are often seen in groups of about
{four or five, and foxes can be seen in
{the day and heard at night.  Another  
{nocturnal animal, the badger, also    
{lives in this area.                   
{                                      
{Groups of herons and sometimes an     
{elusive kingfisher can be seen along  
{the river banks.Mallards and moorhens 
{will also be found here.  In the      
{rivers themselves trout are quite     
{numerous. }                           </content>
