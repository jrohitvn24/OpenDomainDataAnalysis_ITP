		<title>19Mr. Melsop's Farm</title>
		<content>    Mr. Melsop farms 45 acres,35 acres 
 of this land he owns, the other 10    
 acres are rented. He has owned this   
 land for 40 years and works it either 
 by himself or with family help.       
    Following Common Market regulations
 he finds it better to produce grass   
 crops rather than any other arable    
 produce. He uses it for fodder i.e.   
 winter feed for his animals. He breeds
 Charolais cattle and a cross between  
 Charolais and Hereford. The Charolais 
 are bred for beef and the Hereford    
 cross for milk.                       
    the farmer does not market any of  
 his hay crops but the milk is taken to
 the dairy. He began dairy farming when
 he was 17, during the war.Then he     
 worked with a herd of cows around     
 Waverley Road. This farm was known for
 prducing the best milk in the area.
