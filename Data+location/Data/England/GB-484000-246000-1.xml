		<content>THE LAND IN THIS SQUARE IS DIVIDED     
BETWEEN THE PARISHES OF STOKE          
GOLDINGTON, RAVENSTONE, GAYHURST,      
FILGRAVE CUM TYRINGHAM,LATHBURY AND A  
MINUTE PART OF EMBERTON.THE WHOLE AREA 
IS DEVOTED TO AGRICULTURE AND IS NOT   
DENSELY POPULATED. THE MAIN CENTRES OF 
POPULATION ARE THE VILLAGES OF GAYHURST
AND FILGRAVE WITH OTHERS HOUSES AND    
FARM WIDELY SCATTERED OVER THE WHOLE   
AREA. THE RIVER GREAT OUSE FLOWS       
THROUGH NEARLY ALL OF THE 12 KILOMETER 
SQUARES AND ITS PROPENSITY TO FLOOD THE
SURROUNDING FIELDS HAS A NOTICEABALE   
IMPACT ON FARMING.POPULATION HAS GROWN 
IN RECENT YEARS, THOUGH NOT            
SUBSTANTIALLY, BUT AS A COMMUNITY IT IS
SUFFERING FROM PROBLEMS COMMON TO MANY 
OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES IN BRITAIN e.g.
CLOSURE OF THE LOCAL VILLAGE SCHOOL,   
POST OFFICE AND EVEN PARISH CHURCH.
