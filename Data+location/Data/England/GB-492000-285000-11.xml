		<content> In May 1977 the building was opened as
 sheltered housing for the elderly.    
 Built on the site of {Jabez Rowell's }
 fellmongers yard and built of red     
 brick to a modern design it was not   
 greeted with universal approval. It   
 has become a centre of village life.  
 Coffee mornings are held in the large 
 lounge as are concerts and recitals.  
 Local school children visit and       
 entertain. There is also a day centre 
 based here and the elderly of the     
 village are able to visit each week.  
 There are outings by coach and the day
 centre has a large band of willing    
 supporters to help in any way they    
 can.
