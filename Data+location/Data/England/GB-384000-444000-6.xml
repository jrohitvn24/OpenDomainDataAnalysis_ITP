		<title>06RECREATION IN BARNOLDSWICK</title>
		<content> We did a survey of the things some of 
the local people enjoy doing in their  
spare time. Knitting and needlework is 
the most popular with the ladies.      
 Sports are very popular too as there  
are many sport facilities in and around
Barnoldswick. We have a local swimming 
pool and tennis courts. We have        
football pitches and a golf course. In 
Victory Park there is a bowling green. 
Next comes watching television. This is
not quite as popular as sports and     
needlework.                            
 Reading and gardening are much enjoyed
pastimes. We have a local library and  
many gardens and allotments.           
 Quite a few people enjoy walking. The 
scenery around Barnoldswick is quite   
picturesque.                           
 Some of the ladies enjoy cooking and  
baking.
