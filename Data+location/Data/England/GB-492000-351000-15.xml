		<title>15FARMING LEADENHAM CROPS</title>
		<content> Although Lincolnshire has long been   
 thought of as a potato growing area,  
 very few are now grown in the part    
 around Leadenham. This is largely due 
 to the labour needed.Wheat and Barley 
 are the main grain crops grown at the 
 present time. Grass is grown for      
 silage and as hay for winter feed.One 
 crop now widely grown in the area is  
 oil seed rape which covers the land   
 with brilliant yellow in the flowering
 season.The other main crop grown      
 around Leadenham is sugar beet.This is
 lifted from September onwards and is  
 transported in lorry loads to the     
 local Sugar Corporation factory at    
 Kelham.Over the past years the growing
 of sugar beet and the subsequent      
 processing of sugar has increased     
 greatly and this has lowered the need 
 for the import  of sugar from         
 overseas.                             </content>
