		<title>05 Effect of the Motorway M5</title>
		<content>                                       
      Before the M5 was open there was 
 a title change in the villages of East
 Brent and Brent Knoll. Any alterations
 were gradual and spread over many     
 years.                                
      The M5 from Exeter, with links to
 Bristol, London and Birmingham, opened
 in 1973 and has access road at        
 Edithmead very close to both villages.
 There is also a rest/picnic area known
 as Brent Knoll Rest Area, but actually
 in the East brent boundaries. This is 
 a parking area with toilets and some  
 food facilities.                      
      Since it was opened, many people 
 have moved into both villages from the
 towns. More houses have been built and
 old houses renovated.
