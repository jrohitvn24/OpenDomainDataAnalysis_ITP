		<title>03THE BLAISDON PLUM</title>
		<content>{A plum worth talking about.           
 Mr and Mrs Walton, Tanhouse Farm      
 Blaisdon grow the Blaisdon plum. Mr   
 Walton's family were fruit merchants  
 in Liverpool until his father settled 
 in Blaisdon to supply the business. At
 one time Blaisdons were their sole    
 crop,now they keep cattle and sheep   
 too for the jam market is in decline. 
 The{Blaisdon}is a commercial plum,    
 first grown in the village 120 years  
 ago by a Mr Dowding. It will only grow
 within a 25 mile radius of the        
 village. It is smaller than a{Victoria
{but travels}better although it is     
 quite acidic. The trees are self      
 pollinating, reach maturity in about  
 12 years and produce good yields for  
 the next 30.They need some spraying   
 but unlike Victorias don't suffer from
 silver blight.
