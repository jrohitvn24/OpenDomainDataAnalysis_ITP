		<content>    The 2 old schools in Horton Kirby  
 are now used as field centres. The    
{Darent Valley}is of great interest for
 field studies and environmental       
 studies. It contains historic sites   
 such as{Lullingstone Roman Villa,     
 several interesting villages and a    
 variety of natural habitats.          
   The Horton Road Environmental       
 Studies Centre, run by the Inner      
 London Education Authority, is used by
 26 selected primary schools from      
 Educational Priority Areas. There are 
 2 full-time and 2 part-time staff. The
 Centre has 3 classrooms and a library.
    Each class makes a series of visits
 throughout the year carrying out a    
 programme of varied activities. The   
 children are mainly 9 to 11 years old.
 Coach trips are made to local places  
 of interest. There are 3 groups       
 working at the Centre every day.      </content>
