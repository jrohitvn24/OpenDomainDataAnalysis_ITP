		<content> My Mum is not much taller than me but 
 has blond hair which is long and curly
 and she is a Health Visitor. My dad is
 36 and has short dark hair and is     
 about 1m 81cm tall and he is a        
 Policeman. I go and clean my teeth and
 wash, then I put on my coat and go to 
 school.                               
 When I arrive I see my best friend    
 Martin Cottington. After an uneventful
 play we have an Assembly and go back  
 to class where we do Maths. Then it is
 break and after that we do Creative   
 Writng. We then have lunch at 12.15p.m
 then break again which ends at 1.15p.m
 then we would do topic work. At       
 2.30p.m. we do P.E. and then go home. 
 After I have got home I watch         
 television or go out to play in the   
 garden; then I have dinner and go to  
 bed.                                  
 That is a typical Friday.             </content>
