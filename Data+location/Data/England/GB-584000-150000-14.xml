		<title>14THE  MONDAY  CLUB</title>
		<content> On Monday a group of about twelve     
 children meet at Harrietsham Primary  
 school as members of a social club.   
 We sometimes go for walks and leave   
 signs made with sticks for others to  
 follow. Occasionally we  play rounders
 or football. When it is raining  we   
 play indoors and can play  darts,     
 snooker, badminton and other games    
 All children in Monday club make a lot
 of noise and we have a good time for  
 which we pay 5p.for two hours and have
 squash and crisps as refreshments     
 There are three adults who look after 
 us, one of whom collects me and takes 
 me home when it is finished. I enjoy  
 going to the club as it is fun and it 
 is better than sitting at home.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
