   Melling and Arkholme are villages on
opposite sides of the R.Lune which     
flows through a beautiful valley with  
farms where cows and sheep graze. The  
river meanders, causing large shingle  
banks. Hills rise on each side and     
Ingleborough Hill can be seen. A road  
follows the river on each side through 
the villages that have a blend of very 
old and modern houses. Both villages   
are accessible from the M6 motorway.   
   In Melling visitors are welcome at  
the residential Melling Hall Hotel that
is close to the old church with its    
peal of bells. A motte lies behind the 
church. Arkholme also has a motte, like
an upside down basin, dominating the   
church. The Brown Cow is the Arkholme  
local. Both villages have an Institute 
hall where various activities take     
place.           &lt;Continued........    </content>
