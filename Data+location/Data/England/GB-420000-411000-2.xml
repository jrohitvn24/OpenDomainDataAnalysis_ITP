		<title>02THE OLD WATER MILL.</title>
		<content> This has always been a farming area   
 and it is mentioned in the Domesday   
 Book under the Soke of Wachenfeld.    
 There are several old farmhouses and  
 at Mr. Swift's farm there is an old   
 water mill which is a listed building.
 During the war the old water wheel was
 ripped off for scrap metal but other_ 
 wise it would have been the second    
 largest in the British Isles. It took 
 eight horses to start it, and once    
 they got mangled in the machinery.    
 When the mill was  working, the water 
 to keep the wheel going ran from the  
 pond down a pipe, out into the stream.
 The stream drove the wheel. The pond  
 is very pretty, with trees and grassy 
 banks around it. The pond's wildlife  
 is quite large. There are coots,      
 mallards, geese, trout, bream and     
 tadpoles.                             
                                       </content>
