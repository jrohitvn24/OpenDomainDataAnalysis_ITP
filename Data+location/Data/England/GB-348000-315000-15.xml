		<content>  Windermere Road was the site of a    
 large Air Force Camp during the Second
 World War.                            
   Mount Pleasant Road was just a      
 narrow side road, no houses, there was
 a wooden bridge sited here.           
   Beyond the railway bridge on the    
 left hand side was a row of three     
 story terraced houses known as Mount  
 Pleasant, these houses are still      
 there today in 1985.                  
   Opposite these on the right hand    
 side was acottage where an old lady   
 sold vegetables and fruit by the      
 garden wall she has a summer house    
 with stained glass windows and a      
 parrot who could talk to the passers  
 by.                                   
   Near the 'Steam Wagon' public house 
 was a large farm known as Randall's   
 Farm, to reach the Ellesmere road you 
 had to go via a narrow lane.          </content>
