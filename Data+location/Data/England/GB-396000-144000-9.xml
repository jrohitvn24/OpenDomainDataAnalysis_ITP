		<title>09SUPERNATURAL, CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Chitterne is located in an area rich  
 in archaelogical remains and tales of 
 supernatural occurences in the area   
 are numerous. In the village itself   
 one of the most haunted locations is  
 "The Gatehouse". It was once a halfway
 rest house for clerics travelling     
 between Lacock Abbey and Amesbury     
 Abbey. One night a coach arrived and a
 young stable lad ran out to help.     
 Unfortunately he was run down and     
 killed by the horses.A cross gouged in
 the wall commemorates the accident and
 his ghost has been reported several   
 times. Recently in the house itself a 
 young woman working there saw an old  
 lady in a long grey dress standing in 
 the doorway, then she appeared sitting
 on a chaise longue. When the young    
 woman spoke to her she disappeared in 
 an icy blast of air.
