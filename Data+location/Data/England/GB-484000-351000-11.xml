		<title>11Beckingham(Lincs) _ Children</title>
		<content> In the parish of Beckingham and Sutton
 there are  68 children, 33 boys and 35
 girls. Unfortunately  the  village has
 no schools therefore the children have
 to travel out of the village to attend
 school.                               
 Eleven   out  of  the  fifteen  junior
 school   children   attend  the  Brant
 Broughton Primary school which is some
 3 miles away.                         
  Fifteen  children of secondary school
 age attend the comprehensive school at
 Welbourn and  a further sixteen attend
 schools in Sleaford and Newark.       
  There are nine children who go to the
 playschool at  Brant Broughton  and  a
 further fourteen  young  children  and
 babies.                               
 The main  activity for the children is
 the playing field but for the last two
 years    most    successful    village
 Christmas parties have been arranged. </content>
