		<title>07 A Day in the life of George</title>
		<content>   On Sunday I go to 8.30 a.m. Mass at 
Cotton. We leave daddy at home milking 
the cows.Then we all have a good break 
fast of eggs and bacon.  While daddy   
works in the garden Francis,Joanna,    
Michael and l go and play cricket in   
the field but Fleet,the dog,keeps      
running off with the ball so then we   
play French cricket. Sometimes Francis 
and I go to the river for a walk. When 
we take our binoculars we can see lots 
of wildlife like wild ducks,herons,blue
tits,yellow wagtails,sparrows,house    
martins and even some trout. Then we   
come home to a lovely cooked dinner    
like meat, stuffing,gravy,potatoes and 
cauliflower. After a late dinner we    
help to fetch the cows in for daddy,   
ready for milking. After tea we have a 
bath and get ready for bed.Sometimes I 
come down stairs again to watch T.V.for
a short while before I get into bed.   </content>
