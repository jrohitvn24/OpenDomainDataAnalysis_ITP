		<content> There are five Churches in Wareham.   
 The Church of England(Lady St.Mary and
 St. Martin's Chapel),Methodist,United 
 Reformed,Evangelical.The Rector of    
 Wareham said that only 5% of the      
 population go the church regularly and
 that the 14-25 age range is the least 
 represented social group.The Parish   
 Church provides four Sunday services  
 from the Holy Communion to the more   
 informal Family Services.A wide range 
 of activities are provided in the     
 week.These range from facilities for  
 the very young to groups for the older
 members of the Church.This is said to 
 be an ecumenical Parish in which the  
 churches work together.There is an    
 ecumenical council.
