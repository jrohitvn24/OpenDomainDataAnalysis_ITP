 Church of England "All Saints Church" 
 Zion Methodist Chapel, Baptist Chapel 
 "Assembly of God", Gospel Hall,       
 Two Wesleyan Chapels (now closed)     
 "Jehovah's Witnesses" (who use their  
 homes for meetings).                  
 The parish church has a fairly small  
 weekly congregation but is popular for
 weddings and christenings.            
 The most popular chapel is the Zion   
 Methodist especially among younger    
 people.                               
 There were two Wesleyan Chapels, the  
 first is now a house, the second is a 
 warehouse. The second chapel was built
 during the l926 strike as the first   
 was too small for the congregation.   
 Congregations are falling at most     
 places of worship.
