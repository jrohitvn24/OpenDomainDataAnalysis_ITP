 The Methodist Church is the only place
 of worship in the village.It was      
 built in 1844,and is constructed of   
 red brick with a slate roof.It has a  
 seating capacity of 120,but at the    
 present there are only four           
 members.One service is held every     
 Sunday from 2.30p.m. to 3.30p.m.      
 The minister lives in a nearby small  
 town and has pastoral care of several 
 churches in the area.He preaches here 
 once every month.The other services   
 are taken by lay preachers.           
 There is a lively Sunday School held  
 every Sunday morning from 11a.m. until
 noon,and it is supervised by a local  
 farmer's wife.                        
 The Anglicans here worship in nearby  
 village churches.                     </content>
