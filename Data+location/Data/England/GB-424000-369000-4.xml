 millstone grit, and approximately     
 32 inches of rain fall annually.      
     The parkland is grazed by         
 livestock and deer, and produces a    
 very pleasant scene with groups, and  
 individual trees, of all ages and     
 small blocks of woodland.             
     The village of{Edensor}with its'  
 church is completely within the 12 Km

 together with the school is also      
 within this block, as are several     
 farmhouses and cottages.

 north and south following the River   
 Derwent.                              
                                       
     The following pages written by    
 residents of the area describe a way  
 of life steeped in tradition and      
 loyalty.                              </content>
