		<content> During the middle months of 1985,     
 almost all denominations in our area  
 were looking forward to{Mission}      
{England.}This was a visit by the      
 evangelist{Billy Graham.}Posters were 
 in most churches and pasted on boards 
 all over the area. Billy Graham came  
 to Sheffield United football stadium  
 in the week beginning June 22nd.      
      We saw him live but he was beamed
 via satellite to 51 centres across    
 Britain and Ireland, and eight other  
 countries.                            
      When we were there, there        
 were 31,000 people and a choir of     
 4,000. Billy Graham was standing in   
 the middle of the stadium on a        
 platform talking to people, and       
 talking about how we should live our  
 lives and follow{Jesus.}
