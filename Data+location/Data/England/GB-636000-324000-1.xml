		<content> The D-Block is divided into 3 distinct
 areas: urban development in the SE    
 corner around the village of Stalham; 
 the marshy borders of the River Ant in
 the west and the arable which         
 comprises the rest.                   
 The dominant industry is agriculture  
 but due to increasing mechanisation,  
 it employs a diminishing work-force.  
 In spite of this, the population has  
 rapidly expanded with the arrival of  
 large numbers of residents from       
 outside the area and who commute daily
 to urban centres of work.             
 This is reflected in all aspects of   
 life.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
