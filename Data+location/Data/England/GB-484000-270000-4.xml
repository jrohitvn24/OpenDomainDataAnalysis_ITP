		<title>04Industry in Little Harrowden</title>
		<content>   Northamptonshire is famous for its  
boot and shoe industry based on the    
hides of local cattle and sheep.Today  
the industry relies on imported hides  
and skins.                             
   It is interesting to find that the  
only factory in Little Harrowden is a  
shoe factory.The site on which the     
factory stands was originally a nissan 
hut used during the second world war   
to house Italian prisoners of war.     
   In 1935 the present building was    
built as a privately owned factory.    
Today the factory makes men and womans 
fashion shoes for Clarkes and Tarrys.  
   The factory employs 27 women.There  
is a method of cutting out the leather 
called clicking,this is done at their  
Finedon factory.Little Harrowden is    
where the closing is done.             
   The women using sewing machines     
stitch the pieces of leather together. </content>
