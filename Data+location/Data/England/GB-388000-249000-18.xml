		<title>18British Legion Club, Norton</title>
		<content>   The British Legion Club is like a   
 public house where ex-service people  
 go to have a drink and a chat with    
 their friends.  They may prefer to    
 play Bingo or Darts.                  
   Certain members known as "Sea-      
 Members" are people who have been     
 voted into the club but were not in   
 the Armed Forces. They cannot hold    
 Office. Ladies can join the club and  
 can go on the committee.              
   The club is open every day, except  
 Tuesday, and is used by people from   
 surrounding villages.                 
   The land on which it stands belonged
 to F.W. King. When he died, he left   
 all his money and land to The British 
 Legion. On that land they built the   
 club house that stands today. There   
 are also British Legion Clubs at      
 Pinvin and Worcester.
