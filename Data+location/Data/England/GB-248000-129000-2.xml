 The youth hostel is housed in a       
 rambling old Victorian house. The     
 previous occupant grew rare bulbs in  
 its large and sheltered garden. Being 
 just off a busy holiday route, the    
 hostel is very busy. There are plenty 
 of attractions in the surrounding area
 for prospective visitors. The building
 itself still retains its old          
 character. There are marble fireplaces
 and high ceilings. However, the       
 facilities offered to visitors are    
 very good i.e. common room, drying    
 room, a large members' kitchen and    
 even an outside classroom. It has     
 family rooms as well as the usual     
 dormitories.
