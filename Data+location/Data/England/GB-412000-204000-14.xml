		<title>14Dry Stone Walls</title>
		<content>  In this area there are many miles of 
 dry stone walls.My grandad, John      
 Reeves, is a dry stone wall builder.  
 This is how he  repairs a wall:       
  The wall is marked out with a guide  
 line. On the outside faces a layer    
 of thick stones is placed down. It is 
 important that these stones are of    
 equal thickness.The space between the 
 large stones is filled with small     
 stones. The line is then raised 7 cm  
 more and a thinner layer of stones is 
 placed down. Care has to be taken so  
 that the stones do not wobble.        
  The string is raised once more and a 
 thick layer of stones laid. This      
 process is repeated until the wall is 
 the correct height. Some walls are    
 finished with stones placed on their  
 edge. John will complete two yards of 
 wall a day.
