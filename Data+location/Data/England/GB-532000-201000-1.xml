		<title>01The Cheshunt Area</title>
		<content>     Cheshunt can be divided into two  
 contrasting areas; the urban sprawl of
 the town itself and the rural area    
 centred on Goffs Oak. Open farmland is
 being replaced by new housing         
 developments such as the Rosedale     
 Estate, originally built by the GLC to
 provide homes for families from       
 Hackney and Islington. This contrasts 
 with attractive, detached properties  
 around Goffs Oak.                     
     Transport facilities to London are
 excellent although many people work   
 locally. A new swimming pool, sports  
 hall and shopping centre have recently
 been built.                           
     Everyone knows of the new Tescos  
 and Spurs football ground but signs of
 Cheshunt's historical past are still  
 evident in St. Mary's Church,Cedar    
 Park and a few old houses.
