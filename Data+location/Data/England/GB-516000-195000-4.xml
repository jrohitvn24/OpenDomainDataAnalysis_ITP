		<title>04ENTERTAINMENT IN BOREHAMWOOD</title>
		<content> Borehamwood is a large town, sorely   
 lacking good recreational facilities. 
{Sport}is fairly well catered for but  
 general entertainment is not. There   
 used to be a cinema but this has now  
 been demolished.{Films}are shown in   
 the{Civic Hall,}a multi-purpose venue 
 also used for shows, dances etc. While
 the shows are of a good standard one  
 building cannot serve the whole town. 
 Children and teenagers do have the    
 occasional{disco,}although some of    
 these have ceased to operate. There is
 a general feeling that without        
 entertainment offered by schools and  
 other organisations there would be    
 nothing. There is little wonder that  
{boredom}exists and therefore{vandalism
 occurs. Adults have{public houses}as  
 their major 'social' centre. However, 
 with transport, they can travel to    
 nearby towns for better facilities.   </content>
