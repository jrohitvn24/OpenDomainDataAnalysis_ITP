		<content> The  Parish Church  lies  in  a  steep
 wooded  valley,  half a mile  from the
 sea.  Parts of the building are{Norman
 though the{Saxon }font  indicates wor-
 ship on the site from an earlier time.
 The list of vicars dates from the{13th
 century,  and  the  church records are
 complete from{1588.}The 6 bells, three
 dating from the 18th century, were re-
 conditioned and rehung in 1983.  Today
 there is a thriving band of ringers.  
 The  congregation  averages  25 to 30,
 greater numbers attending at festivals
 There has been no resident vicar since
 1960,  when  the  living  was combined
 with{Kilkhampton.                     
 The{Methodist Chapel}at{Shop}was built
 in 1913.  It is one  of 17  chapels on
 the{Bude circuit.}The average congreg-
 ation is 25,  with a  Sunday School of
 about 30.
