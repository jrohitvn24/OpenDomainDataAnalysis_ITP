		<content> Our parents only work during the week 
 so they can be with us at the weekend.
 On Saturday we often go into Rugby to 
 shop or just look around.If it is fine
 we play outside with our friends.We   
 like playing tennis.Saturday evening  
 meal is usually chips and a salad in  
 the Summer.We watch television in the 
 evening before going to bed,later than
 usual as there is no school the next  
 day.On Sunday our parents often take  
 us to the Sports Centre to go swimming
 An Aquaslide opens there on 19th July 
 1985.This is a long slide that starts 
 high up and winds round inside and    
 outside the building ending in the    
 swimming pool.It looks like a helter- 
 skelter but it is covered in.We play  
 outside in the afternoon.We always    
 have a roast dinner on Sunday.Then we 
 get ready for school on Monday.
