 All the common birds are to be seen in
 and around  Middleham and East Witton.
 Often to be seen are lapwings,        
 oyster-catchers and curlews as they   
 fly between their nests and the rich  
 feeding grounds of the River Ure. A   
 kingfisher was recently seen.  Larks, 
 yellow and pied wagtails, pippits and 
 cuckoos can frequently be seen. On the
 Rivers Ure and Cover there are moorhen
 and coots, mallards, gulls,  sand -   
 martins and sometimes herons.  House- 
 martins nest under the eaves of houses
 .  Tawny owls and barn owls are also  
 seen.   Woodpigeons, rooks, jackdaws  
 and magpies are common.  Pheasants are
 frequently killed by vehicles on the  
 country roads.                        </content>
