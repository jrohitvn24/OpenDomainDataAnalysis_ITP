		<title>03"Gypsies" in block 04480453</title>
		<content>   While surveying block reference     
{04480453}we came across a rough gypsy 
 encampment on the verge of a narrow   
 country road.                         
   There was none of the romance of    
 colourfully-painted caravans or       
 anything of the idealised view of     
 Romany life.  This was a poor         
 collection of old motor caravans nd   
 other shelters improvised from car    
 bodies, scrap wood and corrugated     
 iron.                                 
   The main business of the group was  
 clearly scrap metal as several of     
 them, including young children, were  
 engaged in stripping down old washing 
 machines and other domestic hardware. 
   Further information is unavailable  
 as we were firmly escorted from the   
 site as soon as our presence was      
 noted.  We therefore record them as   
 part of the UK's unofficial population</content>
