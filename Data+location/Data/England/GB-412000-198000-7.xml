		<title>07The A417 Trunk Rd: Fairford</title>
		<content> The A417 is in the north of the SW    
 Fairford area, and runs east-west.The 
 road in this section goes from        
 Cirencester to Lechlade.In the west of
 this area is the village of Meysey    
 Hampton.Here a road branches off the  
 A417 to the south and another road    
 turns off to the north.Continuing east
 the road is twisty,passing fields of  
 crops.Two more roads branch to the    
 south.Three farms lead off this road  
 west of Fairford.                     
 Waiten Hill,approaching Fairford,is a 
 gentle slope which can be slippery in 
 winter.In Fairford there is an arched 
 stone bridge spanning the River Coln. 
 Travelling through Fairford some shops
 have frontages on the road,and at     
 times the road becomes congested with 
 traffic,including heavy lorries.
