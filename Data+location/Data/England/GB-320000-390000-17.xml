		<title>17GREAT MEOLS:LOCAL HISTORY.</title>
		<content> On{October 11,1880,}a small brick     
 building, with slate roof, opened as a
 church school.In 1980 the building    
 still served the community as the     
 annexe to the more recently built     
 state school.Originally consisting of 
 a single schoolroom with an infants'  
 class attached,the building was heated
 by coal fires,occasionally causing    
 classes to fill with smoke!           
 Many pupils came from farming families
 and absented themselves at harvest    
 time or were unable to attend because 
 of flooding of local lanes.           
 Emphasis was placed on the"Three Rs"  
 (Payment by Results) as well as needle
 work and art.                         
{Evacuees}swelled the school's numbers 
 during 1939;children carrying gas mask
 cases to school and lessons being     
 interrupted by air- raid warnings as  
 dockland Birkenhead was attacked.     </content>
