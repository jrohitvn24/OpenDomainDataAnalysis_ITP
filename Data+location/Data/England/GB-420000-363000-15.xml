		<title>15LEISURE AND RECREATION</title>
		<content> Local people spend their leisure time 
 indoors in a number of ways. A third  
 of the adults enjoy reading, a quarter
 relax in practical leisure such as    
 knitting, sewing and do-it-yourself   
 and a further quarter spend their     
 leisure time watching television,     
 using computers and listening to the  
 radio. The old people can go to the   
 Monday Centre at the Village Hall     
 where they can chat to their friends. 
 The main outdoor leisure activities   
 are gardening and walking. Gardeners  
 work on allotments at the top of the  
 village and there are beautiful walks 
 all round the village. Some groups    
 spend their evenings at the pub where 
 they talk and play pool, billiards,   
 darts and dominoes. Over half of the  
 families have seaside holidays: a     
 quarter prefer to stay locally.
