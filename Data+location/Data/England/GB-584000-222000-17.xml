		<content>{TRANSPORT}We travel around mostly in  
 cars.The cars run on petrol.There are 
 three grades of petrol two,three and  
 four star.Different cars go on        
 different types.The car manufactures  
 are Ford,Vauxhall and British         
 Leyland.Most cars are not automatic.In
 Coggeshall we have one bus service    
 which runs from Coggeshall to         
 Colchster.but there is a Community    
 bus that takes people where the bus   
 doesn't go.There isn't a railway in   
 Coggeshall, the nearest is in         
 Kelvedon.All the goods are delivered  
 by lorries. To prevent lorries coming 
 through Coggeshall a Bypass was built 
 A motor_bike is a petrol powered      
 bicycle.Yamaha and Suzuki are popular 
 motor_bikes. Most children have bikes.
 BMX's are the most popular. There are 
 also racers and leisure bikes.
