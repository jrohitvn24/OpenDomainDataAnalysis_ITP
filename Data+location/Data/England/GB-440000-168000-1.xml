		<title>01LAMBOURN VALLEY NW NEWBURY</title>
		<content> This is a rural area lying between the
 A4 (Newbury to Hungerford Road) and   
 the B4000 which follows the course of 
 the River Lambourn. This river is a   
 chalk stream rising on the Berkshire  
 Downs and joining the River Kennet to 
 the east of Newbury. Most of the land 
 is part of the Sutton estate which has
 meant that the land has remained      
 agricultural and industrial and       
 residential development has been      
 negligible. Approximately one third of
 th land is devoted to woodland and the
 rest is mainly mixed farmed, (arable  
 and sheep rearing). The main          
 settlement is the village of          
 Stockcross which is situated in the SE
 corner and has a population of        
 approximately 300. Elsewhere the      
 population is scattered.
