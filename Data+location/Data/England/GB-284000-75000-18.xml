 into small bits.                      
       From here we went to the mine.  
 We saw where the men went down        
 underground and saw the wagons being  
 pulled up by a cable. The 6 wagons    
 then tipped the clay into storage     
 bays.                                 
       Last of all we went to the      
 Processing Plant where the clay was   
 ground either into powder and bagged  
 or into noodles ready for sending     
 abroad .Karachi, Singapore &amp;          
 Chittagong were some of the countries 
 to which the clay was being exported.
