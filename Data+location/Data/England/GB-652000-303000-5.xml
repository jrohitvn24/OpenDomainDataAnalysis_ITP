		<content> Today the holiday attractions and     
 accomodation are largely confined to  
 the area around the pier and the cliff
 areas above. A survey carried out in  
 the summer of 1985 showed a swimming  
 pool, the Floral Hall for live        
 entertainment, several amusement      
 arcades and a range of small          
 restaurants, snack bars and a public  
 house. There was also a putting green 
 on Pop's Meadow where years ago a     
 concert party performed nightly. Some 
 twenty hotels and guest houses        
 provided accomodation with a number of
 holiday flats. The pier and north     
 beach were however still very crowded 
 on fine days between May and September
 with mostly family groups coming from 
 mainly the Midlands and South-East    
 England, staying however for the most 
 part in caravans and holiday camps    
 outside Gorleston.                    </content>
