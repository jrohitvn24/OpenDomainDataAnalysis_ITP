		<title>02HOW PUPILS TRAVEL TO SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  I ASKED MY FORM 1:4 A MIXED CLASS OF 
 30 PUPILS,HOW THEY TRAVEL TO SCHOOL   
 AND BACK EVERY DAY AND ALSO HOW FAR   
 THEY LIVE FROM SCHOOL.  MY SURVEY     
 SHOWED THAT 9 WALK,14 RIDE BICYCLES,  
 3 GO BY CAR, 1 GOES BY BUS. THIS SHOWS
 THAT CYCLING IS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF
 TRAVELLING TO SCHOOL.                 
  7 PEOPLE TAKE 5 MINUTES TO GET TO    
 SCHOOL AND 7 TAKE 10 MINUTES, 8 TAKE  
 15 MINUTES, AND 4 TAKE 30 MINUTES.    
 THIS SHOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE TAKE 15   
 MINUTES OR LESS TO GET TO SCHOOL.     
  2 PEOPLE TRAVEL ROUGHLY 1/4 OF A MILE
 TO GET TO SCHOOL, 5 PEOPLE LIVE 1/2 A 
 MILE FROM SCHOOL, 6 LIVE 1 MILE FROM  
 SCHOOL AND 12 LIVE LESS THAN 1/4 OF A 
 MILE FROM SCHOOL.  THIS SHOWS MOST    
 PEOPLE LIVE CLOSE TO SCHOOL.          
  12 PEOPLE ARE ON TIME WHEN THEY GET  
 TO SCHOOL,10 ARE EARLY AND 5 ARE LATE.
 THIS SHOWS MOST PUPILS ARE PUNCTUAL.  </content>
