		<title>10A Forester's Year</title>
		<content> In January and February a forester's  
 main job is thinning out the trees and
 taking the timber away.In March       
 planting begins and preparing the     
 seed beds.If the weather is mild,     
 sowing begins.In April and May weeding
 is the main job.In June, July and     
 August the fences have to be checked  
 and repaired if necessary to stop     
 rabbits, sheep and deer from entering 
 the woods.In September,October and    
 November weeding and transplanting may
 take place.In December "Christmas     
 Trees" are harvested. The timber to be
 cut is marked and felled using a chain
 saw. The stump is treated with a      
 chemical to stop fungus growing.The   
 side branches are removed with an axe 
 and used for stakes, posts, pit-props 
 and pallettes. Larger timber is used  
 for pulp and sawlogs.
