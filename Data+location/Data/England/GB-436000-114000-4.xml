 There are 14 incubators at the        
 Princess Anne.Most babies arrive at   
 night.When babies have just been born 
 they give them glucose and other      
 liquids but sometimes they dont give  
 them anything.The mother can eat what 
 she likes after giving birth but      
 that's usually cups of tea and        
 toast.They opened the Princess Anne as
 a separate hospital to the General    
 Hospital because it was too old,too   
 small and in the way .One of the most 
 needed pieces of machinery is one to  
 give oxegen to patients when they need
 it.                                   
 The Princess Anne covers all of       
 Southampton,to Swanick,West End,      
 Chandlers Ford and Ringwood.
