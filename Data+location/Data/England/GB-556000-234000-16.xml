 About 10% of the area is owned by the 
 Ministry of Defence.Before the mid    
 1930's the land was occupied by two   
 farms Abbotts Manor and Shafts.No     
 trace of the latter farm exists. When 
 the Ministry first took over the land 
 for an airfield it was known as       
 Wimbish Airfield,however as radio     
 communications in those days were not 
 too good, to avoid confusion with     
 Wisbech 80 Kms., to the North, it was 
 renamed Debden Airfield.It saw active 
 service during the Second World War   
 and later in peacetime it was used by 
 the R.A.F.for the training of their   
 police dogs.In 1973 the Air Force left
 and in 1979 the airfield was renamed  
 Carver Barracks,after Field Marshal   
 Lord Carver,who was Chief of the      
 Defence Staff 1973 to 1976.
