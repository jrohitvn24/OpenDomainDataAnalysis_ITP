 The Edible Doremouse or Glis_Glis was 
 released into the area by Lord        
 Rothschild of Tring. Attractive, with 
 large ears and a bushy tail, it is now
 a nuisance as it strips the bark of   
 trees. Often hibernating in the roof  
 space of houses, it is a noisy guest, 
 becoming very active during the night.
 The English Doremouse is more widely  
 distributed but is one of our         
 endangered spiecies. The Muntjac deer 
 is an escapee from Woburn Park in     
 Beds. It can often be seen in woods or
 open grasslands, and has a dog_like   
 bark, usually heard in the early      
 morning. Foxes are very common; the   
 cubs seen from May onwards. Since     
 Badgers became a protected species,   
 there are many more sets. In search   
 for insects, they cause havoc, digging
 up grass on golf courses and lawns.   </content>
