		<content> There is a golf course near the river 
 Coquet which runs through Rothbury but
 many of the balls are lost in the     
 water and carried by the current down 
 to the deep pool by the Thrum Mill.   
 There is a swimming pool attached to  
 our school and it will soon be open to
 members of the public. New changing   
 rooms have been built for this        
 purpose.                              
 One of the hotels in Rothbury offers  
 pony trekking and shooting. Another   
 hotel offers fishing and there are    
 plenty of interesting walks in the    
 area.                                 
 I often go trekking with my welsh cob 
 who is sixteen years old. There are   
 some good forest tracks and bridleways
 to follow also county show            
 competitions to enter at Thropton,    
 Whittingham,Glanton and Powburn.
