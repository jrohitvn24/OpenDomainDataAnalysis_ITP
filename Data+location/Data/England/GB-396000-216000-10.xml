		<title>10PEGGLESWORTH FARM</title>
		<content>  The manager, Mr A'Barr, manages about
 800 acres. Roughly 20% is woodland and
 the rest is arable crops apart from   
 about thirty cattle and one hundred   
 sheep. In the wood they shoot deer and
 sell them for Â£0.87 per lb. They also 
 shoot ducks and rabbits.              
  The farm owner, Mr Abad, has two polo
 pitches on which he plays polo with   
 the king of Jordan's brother. They    
 have 44 horses and ten grooms.        
  They use electricity and have their  
 own water supply which originates in  
 Wales. Every field has a name; eg     
 Grindstone field gets its name from   
 the big stones there.                 
  The farm has four tractors, three    
 ploughs, four small cultivators and   
 one topper.                           
  The A'Barr family can trace their    
 ancestors back to 1066.
