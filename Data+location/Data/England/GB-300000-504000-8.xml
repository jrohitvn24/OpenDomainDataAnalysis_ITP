ages of 4 and 11 attend the local      
village Primary school. Beckermet C.E.

was extended in 1975 to accomodate the 
children from the next village of

closed. It is a Church Aided school and
the villagers and the Church shared the
building costs. There are 90 children  
on roll, in the care of 4 teachers     
including the Headmistress. The meals  
are cooked on the premises by 3 Kitchen
staff and there are 2 Dinner Ladies.The
children are from a wide catchment area
and many are transported to and from   
school by bus or car. The children are 
generally bright, articulate,          
inquisitive and enthusiastic.At the age
of 11 they continue their education at
