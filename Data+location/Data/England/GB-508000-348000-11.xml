		<title>11A DAY IN MY LIFE(1)</title>
		<content> I usually wake up about 6.45a.m.      
 I wash,then get dressed and go        
 downstairs for my breakfast.After i   
 wash up the pots but never dry them.At
 8.30.Igo to call for a small boy that 
 I look after on the school bus.On the 
 way Imeet a friend and we then walk to
 the bus stop.                         
             The bus arrives about     
 8.45. at the top of the village.It    
 takes about 5 minutes to get to the   
 next village which is where my school 
 is.The bus drops us off near to the   
 junior school, but the secondary      
 school children including myself have 
 a 5 minute walk to our school.        
           School starts at 9 o'clock. 
 After we have been to our form rooms  
 we may have assembly,if not we wait   
 until 9.25. when lessons start.       
           The School times of lessons 
 are as follows:({see next page please)</content>
