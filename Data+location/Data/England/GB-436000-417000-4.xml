		<title>04Working at Sharlston Pit</title>
		<content>  My Dad is a coal miner who works at  
 Sharlston pit. He is a qualified      
 deputy. He works underground, where he
 does inspections of districts,        
 headings,roadways and faces. He also  
 supervises men doing their work. He   
 has been a miner for 23 years and     
 spent all that time at Sharlston. He  
 works shifts and overtime. The mine is
 1,800ft. deep and it takes about an   
 hour to get to the face. Machines     
 include a shearer for cutting coal and
 a dosco for cutting roadways. Most of 
 the coal goes to the power stations.  
 There are about 1300 men working at   
 the pit and coal reserves for another 
 15 to 20 years.
