		<title>20EAST COKER STREET FAYRE</title>
		<content>  The village hall was the centre      
 of activity when villagers held their 
{Street Fayre}to celebrate the 300th   
 Anniversary of the{Pitchfork          
{Rebellion.                            
{ 17th century costume}and pitchforks  
 were in evidence among the stall      
 holders who lined the street and those
 serving teas in the hall.The scene was
{lively.}A{steam engine}provided the   
 music for a children's{roundabout.}You
 could try moth-ball bashing or ride in
 style in a vintage Rolls Royce.       
  Tombola tickets were on sale beside  
 the "vintage" cider and wine tasting. 
 W.I. "fairings"provided tasty fillers 
 whilst browsing among the bric-a-brac.
  Yet less than a mile away,by the     
 church,an old lady sat in peace on the
 village green.                        
  And that is the nature of the village
 as found by The Park School,Yeovil.   </content>
