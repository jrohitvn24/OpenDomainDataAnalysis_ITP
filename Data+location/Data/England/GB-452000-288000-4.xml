		<title>04LETTERS FROM LOCAL NEWSPAPER</title>
		<content>{*Are all children bad?}A concerned    
 mother writes about the banning of all
 unaccompanied children from a local   
 food store, due to vandalism and      
 pilferage. "We should not tar them    
 with the same brush" she writes.      
{*Another view - Do we need bombs?}Yes!
 Why? There would not be time to make  
 them if we were being attacked.       
{*The re-opening of the Market         
{Harborough to Northampton Railway     
{Line}is a good idea because it will   
 give another way to reach London, and 
 allow shopping in Northampton and     
 Milton Keynes. It will also provide   
 work for local people.                
{*Can readers help raise Â£4,000}by     
 supporting a sponsored parachute jump?
 100 people will jump in aid of local  
 underprivilaged children.{
