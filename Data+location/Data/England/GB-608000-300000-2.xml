		<content>  Wymondham Town Council meets on the  
 first Tuesday of every month and is   
 composed of 15 councillors from the   
 Conservative and Liberal/SDP Alliance,
 parties.There are no Labour members.  
  Mrs. Ford is the town Mayor/chairman 
 of the council. The town Mayor is     
 elected every year from serving       
 councillors. A study has been         
 commissioned to define the council's  
 functions which at present seem to be 
 planning,recreation and leisure and   
 some financial matters.The council    
 also acts in a consultative capacity  
 to the S.N.D.C. and the N.C.C.        
  There is a thriving commercial base  
 with an active Local Chamber of Trade,
 a relatively large industrial estate  
 and smaller group of 'starter units' a
 good proportion of whose occupiers    
 have been unsuccessful. Lotus cars are
 a significant employer.               </content>
