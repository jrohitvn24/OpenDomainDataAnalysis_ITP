		<title>14Mayfield Trout Farm</title>
		<content>This farm is a family run business     
incorporating a 65 acre dairy farm as  
well as the trout farm.  It is situated
on the River Dove.                     
  The young trout are bought in as     
fingerlings at 3-4 inches long and can 
take up to 9 months before they are    
ready to sell.                         
  They are grouped according to size in
earth ponds in the river.  They are fed
on vitamin enriched food pellets and   
their intake varies according to the   
water temperature.  Great care is taken
not to lose fish if the river suddenly 
rises or the ponds and filters become  
blocked with debris.  The fish are     
killed to order by hand with a wooden  
mallet.  The most popular size fish    
being 8-12 oz.  They are all sold fresh
or smoked and frozen.  Trout farming   
has only become popular within the last
five years.                            </content>
