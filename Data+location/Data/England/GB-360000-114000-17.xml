		<title>17SHERBORNE ABBEY</title>
		<content>  The Abbey is the main attraction of  
 Sherborne for visitors. The Abbey was 
 sited on the West side of the town in 
 705. It is the centre of religious    
 life in Sherborne.                    
  Between 1849_80 the Abbey was        
 completely restored. The domestic     
 buildings on the North side of the    
 Abbey are now part of the Sherborne   
 School apart from two exceptions. The 
 walls of the Abbey are of local rubble
 with  dressing and much ashlar facing 
 of Ham Hill stone. The roof was replac
 _ed during 1977_80.                   
  One of the treasures of the Abbey is 
 a fine missal, in which beautifully   
 inscribed lettering was done by John  
 Whas, a monk of Sherborne. In 1539 the
 Abbey was bought for Â£300 to become   
 the parish church. The first Bishop of
 Sherborne was St Aldhelm.
