		<title>05BARCOMBE FIRE STATION.</title>
		<content>{Report by Sarah Broadway.}            
 Mr. Broadway runs Barcombe fire       
 station.He has to teach other firemen 
 basic skills and go out on calls.He   
 enjoys his work very much as it gives 
 him the satisfaction of achieving     
 something.                            
   Barcombe is a small village and is  
 very lucky to have a fire station.It  
 can serve a large area which contains 
 many small villages. Of course it     
 would be great if all villages and    
 towns could have a fire station, but  
 that would be too expensive.          
   The type of emergencies Barcombe    
 fire station is called on varies.Most 
 of the fires they attend are chimneys 
 catching alight or common, forest and 
 hedgerow fires.They also attend road  
 accidents. If another fire station is 
 busy, Barcombe have to cover for them.
