		<title>09SOUTH END SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>  The building which opened its doors  
 for the first pupils in January 1878  
 was originally 3 separate schools     
 catering for about 500 pupils in total
 South End Infants School was for      
 children from about the age of 4 years
 to 7 or 8.  The children then trans-  
 ferred to either the Boys School or   
 the Girls School where they stayed    
 until they achieved the correct grade,
 often 5 years.  The school was        
 supervised by the Elland cum Greetland
 School Board of which there were 7    
 local members.  There was little      
 change until the second world war when
 many evacuees were received from the  
 Ealing area swelling the school       
 population so that as many as 6 or 7  
 children were sitting at a long desk.
