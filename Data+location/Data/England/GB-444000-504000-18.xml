		<title>18Our Village</title>
		<content> Our village is a very pretty          
 village. My Daddy and I went to take  
 the dog for a walk and we saw some    
 beautiful yellow primroses with orange
 centres, they were all on the hill in 
 the shade of the trees; we named it   
 Primrose Valley. Another evening we   
 went on a walk on a sunny evening. We 
 came to a stream; it was shady there  
 with lots of trees with ivy on them. A
 little further along I saw a plank    
 that was over the stream so we crossed
 it then we had an adventure on the    
 other side in the wood.               
                                       
 Sadly since Martha wrote this piece of
 writing her Daddy has tragically died 
 but she wanted it to be included as a 
 memory of the walks they had together 
 in between his busy life as a farmer.
