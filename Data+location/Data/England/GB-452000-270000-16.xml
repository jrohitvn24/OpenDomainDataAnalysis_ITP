		<title>16A week in my Mum's Life</title>
		<content>   My mum goes to work four days a     
 week. On Monday she goes to French    
 lessons in the school. On Monday she  
 also goes into school to help with the
 cooking. She takes a group of six     
 children with Mrs.Aitken.             
   On Tuesday in the summer she goes to
 Tennis club and sometimes to the      
 George afterwards.                    
   On Thursday she helps take the Cubs 
 at 6.30p.m. and stays at school       
 afterwards for Popmobility.           
   On Friday night my mum sometimes    
 goes to the George with her friends.  
   At the weekends my mum likes to go  
 on a walk. She often walks along the  
 Ridgeway to Barby. This is quite a    
 nice walk because you get good views. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
