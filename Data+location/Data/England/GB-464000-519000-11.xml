		<title>11SALTBURN'S ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content> Around our area of Saltburn, Skelton  
 and Marske, one sixth of the land is  
 used for housing. About one third of  
 the land is used for arable, beef     
 cattle and dairy farming. There are   
 also three separate woods, Hazel      
 Grove, Saltburn Gill and Crow Wood,   
 all of which are situated in steep    
 stream valleys. The growth in the     
 valleys are mainly broad leaved trees 
 e.g. Oak, Sycamore, Ash and Horse     
 Chestnut. Also dotted about here and  
 there are Conifers such as Larch,     
 Spruce and Pine. Coming out of        
 Saltburn towards Skelton there are    
 several garden nurseries and a small  
 industrial estate. Each town is       
 situated well above sea level with    
 Saltburn and Marske being placed on   
 top of the cliffs and Skelton lying   
 inland. (E.Mulgrew,R.Snowdon.)
