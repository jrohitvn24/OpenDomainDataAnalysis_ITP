		<title>11PUBLICAN'S DAUGHTER</title>
		<content> My parents run the Three King's:      
 Jack's Booth Public House on the      
 corner of the A4 and the road to      
 Sulhamstead. Being the daughter of a  
 publian is guaranteed to make your    
 life different from most other        
 people's. Sometimes you feel as you   
 have a continuous party going on in   
 your living room. It can sometimes be 
 fun, but sometimes be so irritating   
 that you wish you lived in a house on 
 an estate without a pub in sight.     
 During the week my mornings are very  
 much the same as anyone else's, but in
 the evenings I might find myself      
 helping in the kitchen or elsewhere in
 the pub. It has been difficult to     
 share my family and my life with an   
 endless stream of people. It is hard  
 to accept that their leisure time  is 
 my work time.
