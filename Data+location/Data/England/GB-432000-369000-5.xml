		<title>05EDUCATION IN HOLYMOORSIDE</title>
		<content>    In Holymoorside there is a primary 
 and a junior school. These cater for  
 children upto the age of 11. The      
 school is an integral part of the     
 village community.                    
    At 11 the children go to a junior  
 high school. This school is just      
 outside our area. It is called{Manor  
{School}and is on Old Road in          
 Chesterfield. When the children reach 
 the age of 13, under the{Doncaster    
{System}the parents can choose to      
 transfer their children to one of the 
 senior high schools.                  
   {Chesterfield Sen. High}is for the  
 boys only. It is situated at{Brookside
 and many Holymoorside parents choose  
 it because it has a sixth form and it 
 is nearer than Manor. The school has  
 excellent facilities, including an all
 weather running track and an indoor   
 swimming pool.                        </content>
