		<title>06SWAFFHAM MARKET PLACE</title>
		<content> The market place is a large car park  
 in the middle of the town and is used 
 for setting up market stalls as       
 well.The main attraction of the market
 place is the Butter Cross with its    
 statue of Ceres on top.               
  The whole market place and its roads 
 around it have been completly         
 resurfaced.Bins and little black posts
 have been set around the Butter Cross 
 because cars were parking around it   
 and were damaging the cobble surface. 
   The market stalls sell              
 jeans,jumpers,foam,flowers,fruit,     
 vegetables,sheets,antiques and there  
 is also an auction.                   
   Each market stall has their own     
 place marked out.On the side that Dave
 Boy Greens shop is there are some more
 market stalls.On this side there is   
 also a meat stall,the meat from here  
 is just as good as the meat in shops. </content>
