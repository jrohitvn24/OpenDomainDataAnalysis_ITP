   Parts of Kettering Avondale and     
Warkton Wards, the parishes of Warkton 
and Weekley, Boughton House and part   
of the Estate are within this area.    
                                       
   Consequently interesting contrasts  
are provided.                          
                                       
   There are the two council house     
developments on either side of the A43 
in the north-eastern part of the town. 
                                       
   The scene changes abruptly to one   
of meadowland and parkland as Boughton 
Estate is approached.                  
                                       
    Encompassed by the Estate are the  
delightful picture-book villages of    
Warkton and Weekley with their stone   
and thatch cottages.
