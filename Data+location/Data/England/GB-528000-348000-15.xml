		<title>15Transport, Gipsey Bridge</title>
		<content>    This  information was taken from a 
 traffic survey taken in the village of
 Gipsey Bridge Between 8.50a.m. and    
 1.00p.m. on a week day in July.       
 Farm vehicles seem to use the road    
 more before 9.00 a.m. whereas there   
 were more lorries betweeen 12.30  and 
 1.00p.m.During the period 8.50 a.m.   
 to 11.00a.m. only the number of       
 passing cars exceded the amount of    
 vans.                                 
     In all the time that the  survey  
 was run  no buses came through the    
 village and most of the people that we
 interviewed in the village thought    
 that there should be more public      
 transport in the area .               
      Neither in the survey nor in our 
 questionnaire taken around the village
 did motorbikes emerge as a major form 
 of transport for the people of the    
 area.                                 </content>
