		<title>06FARMING</title>
		<content> A few farmers still produce hay bales,
 or roll the grass after cutting into  
 huge rolls rather like a swiss roll.  
  The rest of the land (a minority)is  
 used on the stock farms for other     
{fodder}crops such as winter wheat or  
 barley.                               
 The{wealth}in farming stems from a    
 combination of fertile soil,favourable
 mild damp climate and  gently sloping 
 relief.The soil is derived from either
 red sandstone or a deep{red clay      
 called Keuper marl.This red basis is  
 particularly distinctive wherever the 
 red clay is ploughed to show through  
 into the landscape of green.The mild  
 climate with winter temperatures      
 usually well above freezing point     
 (though this is an average            
 figure..temperatures in February often
 seem to fall below freezing)and an    
 annual rainfall of around 900-1000mms </content>
