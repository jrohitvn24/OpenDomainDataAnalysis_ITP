		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN TONGE MOOR.</title>
		<content> Many of the people in our area do not 
 travel far to their place of work.    
 Beloit-Walmsley, metal manufacturers  
 is a principal employer of factory    
 workers in our area. We found other   
 people's occupations to be very       
 varied: security guard, dental lab.   
 technician, computer programmer,gas   
 appliance fitter, double-glazing      
 fitter and two motor mechanics. Self  
 employed people we interviewed were in
 the plumbing, painting and decorating 
 and building trades. Of ladies        
 interviewed, 7 worked in shops, one   
 was a school dinner supervisor and 3  
 are cleaners, one in an office, one in
 a pub and one in a car showroom. A few
 people did not have a job. They were  
 unemployed, housewives or retired     
 people.
