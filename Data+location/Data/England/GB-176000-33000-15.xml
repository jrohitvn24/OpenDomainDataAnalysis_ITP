		<title>15The Day in the Life of......</title>
		<content>  I wake up at about{9:00am,}get up    
 and have breakfast.I go outside at {  
{9:30am}and go up to my friends house  
 and we will go outside on our go-cart 
 or skateboard and sometimes we go into
{Falmouth}to look around and if the    
 weather is not too good we would go to
 the{New Inn}in{Mabe}to play pool.In   
 the afternoon I go into for dinner at 
{1:00pm.}After that we usually play    
 cricket or football until about {     
{6:00pm }which is when we go in,I watch
 television until about {6:30pm}when my
 Mum or Dad will go to the fish &amp; chip 
 shop to get our tea.In the evening we 
 either go to a club such as{Penryn    
{Athletic Football Club}or stay at home
 and either play scrabble or watch     
 television.I would most probably play 
 on the computer until {9:00-9:30pm}   
 which is when I go to bed.
