		<content> There is a Sunday School at St.Martins
 Church, North Owersby, which meets    
 twice monthly.About 15 children attend
 varying in age from 4-13 years. They  
 take part in the special services such
 as Mothering Sunday, Harvest Festival 
 and Christingle. Earlier this year    
 they revived dancing round the Maypole
 as part of a fund-raising effort. New 
 kneelers were made for the Church and 
 Nativity Characters were modelled     
 ready for Christmas. This year's      
 annual outing was a visit to Lincoln  
 Cathedral and the Castle. Plans are   
 being made for a Christmas Party.
