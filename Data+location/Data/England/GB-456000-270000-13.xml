		<title>13RAILWAYS AND CANALS</title>
		<content>{Railways.}There are 2 railway lines   
 that run through our area.As one from 
 Rugby it splits into a single track   
 line to Northampton; joining up again 
 south of Northampton with the main    
 Rugby/London line.They both have      
 automatic signalling and are diesel/  
 electrically operated. There are 3    
 tunnels to travel through - the       
 longest being about 1 and a quarter   
 miles.Fine castleated tunnel shafts   
 can be seen on the surface. George    
 Louis Stevenson stayed in Kilsby      
 during the construction of Kilsby     
 Tunnel.                               
 The{Oxford Union Canal}goes through a 
 tunnel 1465 yds long. As you enter the
 tunnel the tow path is on the left.   
 There are 3 bridges over the canal,   
 one is a road bridge and two are farm 
 bridges.The canal is popular for      
 fishing and holidays in narrow boats. </content>
