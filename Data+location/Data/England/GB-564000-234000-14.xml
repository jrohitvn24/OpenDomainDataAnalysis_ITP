		<title>14 FARMING IN SAMPFORD cont'd</title>
		<content> Rape is a crop that is being grown in 
 larger amounts and by more farmers.   
 This is a new popular crop which is   
 replacing sugar beet in our area as a 
 break crop.It is easy to spot by its  
 bright yellow colour in spring and its
 dry smell in summer.                  
 Few acres are put down to oat.Because 
 the area is not really suitable.Its a 
 really difficult crop to harvest.     
 Lots of farmers have stopped growing  
 sugar beet in the last two years,     
 because the local refinery at Felsted 
 was closed down.Making the transport  
 of the beet for refining was too      
 expensive.The nearest refineries being
 at Bury-St-Edmunds and Ipswich.       
 Large amounts of potatoes are         
 grown.Most are sold from the farm     
 gate.
