		<content>      The Vale of Pewsey is in south   
 central England in a four-mile        
 wide,flat bottomed valley running east
 to west.  The vale is open to wet,    
 south-westerly winds from the Atlantic
 in Winter, but they are dry and warm  
 in the summer.                        
      The surrounding hills are grazed 
 by sheep and cattle.  The land in the 
 valley bottom is mostly corn, grass or
 potatoes.                             
      The Downs are chalk with steep   
 hillsides and flat tops.  Below the   
 chalk lies a thin layer of greensand  
 which projects across most of the     
 vale.                                 
      A typical farm is about 400 acres
 but the biggest landowner has around  
 2000 acres used for wheat, barley and 
 beef.
