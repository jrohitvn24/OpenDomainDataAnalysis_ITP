		<content>  Otley's market square has been       
 recobbled.The market was moved to a   
 nearby carpark,but has now been       
 transferred to its original location. 
 Following the markets recobbling      
 (costing Â£60,000) a ban has been      
 placed to prevent vehicles parking on 
 the square. A warehouseman has        
 stolen a Â£300 racing bike to ride home
 on after a nights drinking.Apparently 
 he smashed the window of Chevin Cycles
 and was found 100 metres down the     
 road,in the gutter,with the Â£300 bike 
 beside him.Otley councillors have     
 agreed to spend Â£700 on a site        
 investigation into the possible uses  
 for the land.The council will buy the 
 land (at Gallows Hill) from the Water 
 Authourities to prevent them from     
 using it for sewage disposal.
