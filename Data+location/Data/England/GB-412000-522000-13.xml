		<title>13The Industrial Site.</title>
		<content> The small industrial site is located  
 at the Eastern side of Cockfield.     
 Although it is in the country it is an
 advantageous position as it is 13     
 miles to Darlington,50 miles to       
 Newcastle,40 to Sunderland and very   
 near to Barnard Castle and Bishop     
 Auckland.It is also close to a good   
 network of roads.The site was founded 
 by English Estates 3 years ago.The    
 site is small having only 3 units.    
 Unit A is taken by a printing firm and
 Units B and C by a Kitchen Furniture  
 firm.Although no more factories can be
 built on the site each Unit could be  
 extended.As an initial incentive firms
 were offered 2 years without payment  
 of rent or rates.Both firms using the 
 site now seem to be well established. 
 The printing firm have some very up to
 date equipment and like to employ     
 local people.                         </content>
