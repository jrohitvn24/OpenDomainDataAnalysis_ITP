		<title>08Life of a Market Gardener.</title>
		<content> On July the first I interviewed Mr    
 Boers at Mill Farm. Mr Boers is a     
 market gardener. He was in his office 
 working with his computer. He has a   
 large market garden. He grows         
 lettuces,freesias and geraniums.He has
 a machine called a blocking machine.  
 The workers put soil in a big tray    
 send it down a conveyor               
 belt into the machine. This forms     
 it into blocks then tubes fixed       
 together make holes in the soil so    
 they can plant the seeds.Some of the  
 workers do it by hand.He has fourteen 
 employees.He has lots of different    
 machinery.He plants half a million    
 lettuce per week.He irrigates his land
 with water from the river.A van takes 
 seedlings all over the United States  
 of America.He works up to eighty hours
 a week.He is a very busy man.
