		<title>03 Morris Dancing</title>
		<content>  At Weethley,Morris Dancing has been  
going for about eleven years.There are 
about twenty five members in the team, 
but not all of them dance at every     
function.Each year,on the first of May,
the Morris Dancers do a May Day dance  
at Weethley church.In 1979 they also   
danced in South Africa.The Weethley    
Morris Dancers were the first to dance 
the dawn in,in England,but only started
in 198O.                               
        They start dancing at dawn     
break.This is to welcome the new day   
in.Between 4O and 6O people turn up to 
watch this special festival.All the    
music is traditional.There are dances  
for the weather,and certain days in the
year,and also dances to help the crops 
grow.The costumes they wear,originally 
came from the moors.They are coloured  
red,yellow and green.
