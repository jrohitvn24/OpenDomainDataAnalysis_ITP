		<content> The area lies part in Cranfield parish
 and mainly in Marston Moretaine       
 parish.To the west the area rises from
 100 feet to part of the ridge of      
 boulder clay which overlooks the area 
 to the east - the Marson Vale.This    
 vale of Oxford clay runs south-west to
 north-east through the area.A wide,   
 flat bottomed valley between the ridge
 of boulder clay and the Greensand     
 ridge to the south.The clay has been  
 extracted by the Fletton Brick        
 Industry and large pits remain such as
 the Brogborough 2 pit in the south of 
 the area, dug to serve the Ridgmont   
 brickworks.The A 421, a major route   
 from the M1 to Bedford and the east   
 coast crosses the area and passes     
 through Marston Moretaine, the major  
 centre of population,for which a By   
 -Pass is proposed.
