		<title>04LOCAL HISTORY. HERMIT PUB.</title>
		<content>{ The Hermit}is approximately{300 years
{old.}It was probably a farmhouse or   
 Inn, but has been a pub most of its   
 life. There used to be a stable in the
 lower part of the building in which it
 could keep 4-5 ponies before going to 
{Leeds or Bradford.}It has three       
 bedrooms, though this was probably one
 large room in the past.{The Hermit }  
 used to be called {The Woolpack }     
 probably because they would store wool
 on occasions. There are two rooms on  
 the ground floor which are both tap   
 rooms because barrels are kept there  
 for dispensing ale, some people may   
 call it a still room as the barrels   
 were propped on stills. This room lead
 out onto a pack horse road which is   
 still there and is called{Prospect    
{Row.}The building hasn't changed very 
 much.{Mr. Hewitt}rents the pub, and   
 has done for{23yrs}from{John Smiths.  </content>
