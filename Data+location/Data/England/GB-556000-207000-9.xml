		<content> It was a normal day, waking up in bed 
 and just lying there for a few        
 minutes.   I struggled to get out of  
 bed.   I said "Now I suppose I'll get 
 dressed and do my face, teeth and     
 hair."   So that's what I did.   I    
 went downstairs to see if breakfast   
 was ready.   I sat down and had       
 Weetabix and toast.   Then I went out 
 to play on the swing and the climbing 
 frame.   My dad came out and asked if 
 I would help him with the mowing.   I 
 emptied the wheelbarrow.   Sometimes  
 my dad lets me mow a bit but usually I
 don't hold it.   He says it is a lot  
 quicker if he does it.   When I had   
 finished doing that work I went       
 indoors to have lunch.We had beef and 
  potatoes.After lunch I had a cornet  
  and then my brother and I played     
  cricket-I lost by one run.At the end 
  of the day I went to bed happily.    </content>
