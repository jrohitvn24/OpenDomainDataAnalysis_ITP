		<title>15Recreation - Hittisleigh</title>
		<content> In this area recreation is mainly of a
 social nature, with everyone taking   
 part. Good use is made of the Village 
 Hall for many of these activities.    
 Keen gardeners hold twice-yearly      
 produce shows, 1 in Spring which      
 incorporates many crafts, and one in  
 Summer which includes cookery.        
 An Annual Fun Night is held in August.
 There are social evenings for young   
 and old, and table-tennis for all age 
 groups during winter. The ladies have 
 a club which meets monthly, and a New 
 Year Dinner. There is a Charity       
 Evening &amp; Barbecue at Medlake, and a  
 Village Outing annually. Many seek    
 recreation in spinning and weaving,   
 others in gardening. In Autumn there  
 is a Harvest Supper, and the Minister 
 at the local chapel holds a Missionary
 Night and regular Bible Class.
