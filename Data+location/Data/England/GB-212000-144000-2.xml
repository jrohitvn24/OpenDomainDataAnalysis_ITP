		<title>02Landscape(windward/lee-side)</title>
		<content> In this section there is a very marked
 difference between the windward-side  
 on the west and the lee-side on the   
 east. The W.cliffs, which take the    
 full force of the Atlantic gales,are  
 steep,rugged and bare of vegetation   
 save for thin grass and clumps of sea 
 pink.                                 
 In contrast the cliffs of the         
 east side are much more gentle and    
 clothed with fern and great banks     
 of rhododendron.There are even a few  
 pockets of stunted sea-leaning trees. 
                                       
 The plateau-like top is mostly grass- 
 covered in the south but becomes      
 dominated by fern, and then bracken,  
 as you go northwards.                 
 In the north,where the island narrows,
 the lee-side is afforded less         
 protection and consequently has less  
 vegetative cover.                     </content>
