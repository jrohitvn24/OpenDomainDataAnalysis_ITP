		<title>13The Church in the Villages</title>
		<content> Elsworth has one church: Holy Trinity 
 Church of England. The Rector is also 
 Rector of the nearby parishes of      
 Boxworth and Lolworth. The Church     
 plays an active role in the village,  
 particularly through the school which 
 is Aided by the Church of England.    
                                       
 Papworth has active Church of England 
 and Methodist churches. There is also 
 a Roman Catholic church which does not
 appear to be in current use.
