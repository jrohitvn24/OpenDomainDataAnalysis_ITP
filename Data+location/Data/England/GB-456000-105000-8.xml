		<content> The population of the Rural Area of   
 Fareham in the 1920's was about       
 eighteen thousand people.In 1930 the  
 name was changed to the Urban District
 of Fareham and with the inclusion of  
 several other villages this took the  
 population up to about thirty         
 thousand.With the exception of the    
 Second World War years the population 
 has steadily increased and now stands 
 at about eightyfive thousand in the   
 Borough of Fareham.The percentage of  
 the population over fifty,like many   
 other places,grows larger every year  
 and in consequence much more building 
 of sheltered accomodation is envisaged
 and indeed taking place.
