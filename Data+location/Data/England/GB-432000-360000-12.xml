		<title>12CROPS AND ANIMALS</title>
		<content>   The area under cultivation is mostly
 grassland,some of which is mown for   
 hay,but the majority is used for      
 grazing.There is some dairying taking 
 place but a large percentage of the   
 animals are store beasts. These       
 animals are housed during the winter  
 months in the small number of         
 buildings present.There are also a few
 sheep in the fields.A few acres of    
 barley are grown also potatoes. Much  
 of the land is woodland, mostly       
 conifers, which are felled on reaching
 maturity. There are a few stands of   
 indigenous trees, deciduous varieties 
 such as oak, beech, etc.              
 A small proportion of the land is used
 as caravan sites.
