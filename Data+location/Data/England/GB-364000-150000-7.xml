		<title>07The watercress beds</title>
		<content> The beds are situated on the outskirts
 of Chilcompton.They were made by      
 putting{concrete}on rough ground and  
 then by adding{gravel}on top.The water
 is supplied by a{spring}which is deep 
 under the ground.It is so deep that   
 nobody has found the source.The{season
 for growing watercress begins in late 
{August}and finishes in the middle of  
{May.}They usually sell watercress in  
 loads of twenty four baskets at a time
 or whatever is required.I was told    
 that if you eat bad watercress you get
{liverfluke.}She said that watercress  
 contained iron, calcium and Vitamin C.
 In the Winter they bend the watercress
 heads down to prevent them from       
 freezing.It was also interesting to   
 know that because it was spring water 
 it was warm.For{seeding}they just cut 
 off the tops of the watercress.It is  
 sent to Bath and sold in many shops.  </content>
