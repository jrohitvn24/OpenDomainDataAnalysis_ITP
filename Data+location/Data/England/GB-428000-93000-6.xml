		<content> One villager gave us this interesting 
 account of the history of the Churches
 of Pennington.There have been three   
 churches in Pennington.The first was a
 Chapel of Ease to Milford.It was      
 called Magdalen Chapel.The earliest   
 mention of it is in the year          
 1276,about the time when Henry of     
 Thistleden was Lord of the Manor.The  
 site of this early church is not known
 but "Priestlands" was the Glebe on    
 which the Priest-in-charge lived.The  
 church  passed out of use in the reign
 of Queen Elizabeth 1,and no trace of  
 the ruins can now be found.After this 
 Pennington was without a church until 
 1837,when it became a                 
 separate,Ecclesiastical District and a
 small church called St.Mark's was     
 built on the present site.As the      
 village grew the church became too    
 small.                                </content>
