		<content> A well established vineyard on a south
 facing slope in the{Exe Valley        
 compares favourably with the classic  
 French and German vineyards.Four wines
 are made here from{vines}originating  
 in France and Germany. They are grown 
 on old soils and rock in contrast to  
 clay and are therefore well drained.  
{The site}is also well protected from  
 the North and West winds, and being   
 above the valley floor has some       
 protection from possible frost damage.
 The grapes ripen one after the other  
 to spread the harvesting.{The wine}is 
 made in the traditional way and       
 matured in oak casks especially made  
 and imported from Bordeaux. The wines 
 have a character all their own, and   
 two{ciders}and a perry are also made  
 at Yearlstone; they are labelled in   
 the old English - Cyder.
