             CALOW                     
 The Parish of Calow covers a huge area
 and includes Calow-a small township of
 almost 3000 people,a suburb of        
 Chesterfield,but in N.E.Derbyshire,   
 Arkwright and Duckmanton-mining areas 
 and Sutton-a small village.           
 The area was occupied before the      
 Normans as part of the Parish of      
 Chesterfield.Original spelling was    
 Kalehal which means bare corner of    
 land and suggests the worst part of   
 the Manor.There are early references  
 to a John Calow living in the area.He 
 was probably a cloth manufacturer or  
 merchant,who also owned some of the   
 land.Records show that linen,woollen  
 cloth and silver were stolen from his 
 home and sheep from his land.
