		<title>15THE LOCAL GALA</title>
		<content> The annual Boltby, Felixkirk, Sutton  
 and Thirlby Gala began in 1977 as a   
 celebration of the Queen's Silver     
 Jubilee for all the children of the 4 
 villages. The event moves from village
 to village on a rota system.          
 This year it was Sutton's turn again  
 and the event was held at Aspen Grove 
 Farm the home of Mr &amp; Mrs M. Wheldon. 
 The children decorated a trailer      
 on Friday evening with the village    
 colours and rode on it at             
 lunchtime on 6 July to the gala       
 field.                                
 The afternoon began as usual with a   
 fancy dress parade. This was followed 
 by the cross country and games for all
 ages. Points are awarded for all the  
 games and the winning village is      
 awarded the cup.                      
 The host village provideds a sit-down 
 tea for the 400 participants.         </content>
