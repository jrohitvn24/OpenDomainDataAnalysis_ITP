		<content>   THE ENNERDALE CENTRE IS VERY BIG.   
 IT HAS A VERY BIG CAR-PARK. DOWN      
 STAIRS ARE CHANGING ROOMS AND         
 CLEAN TOILETS. YOU HAVE A LOCKER FOR  
 YOUR CLOTHES. THE BUILDING WAS BUILT  
 IN AUGUST 1984.  IN THE CENTRE        
 THERE ARE TWO POOLS, ONE IS A LITTLE  
 POOL FOR BEGINNERS AND IS QUITE       
 SHALLOW THE OTHER ONE IS DEEP FOR     
 SWIMMERS. AT THE CENTRE THERE ARE 2   
 SAUNA  CABINS,  2 PLUNGE BATHS,       
 SHOWERS, FITNESS EQUIPMENT, NORDIC    
 SUNBENCHES, T.V. LOUNGE, REFRESHMENTS 
 AND SPACE-INVADERS.    THE PRICE OF   
 ENTRY INTO THE CENTRE IS 60P FOR      
 ADULTS BUT IN THE HOLIDAYS IT'S 30P.  
 THE CHILDREN'S FEE IS  30P BUT IN THE 
 HOLIDAYS IT'S 15P.  SOMETIMES SCHOOLS 
 SEND GROUPS OF CHILDREN TO HAVE       
 SWIMMING LESSONS AT THE BATHS.  THERE 
 ARE PLANS TO EXTEND THE CENTRE.
