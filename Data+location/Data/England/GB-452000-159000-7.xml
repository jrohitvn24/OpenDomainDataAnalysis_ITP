		<title>07Why we live here</title>
		<content>    The reasons people gave for living 
 in this area fell roughly into 3      
 categories. There were those who were 
 born in the area, close_knit families 
 whose roots were here and were likely 
 to stay in this area. A second group  
 had moved into the area because they  
 had found employment locally or in one
 of the 3 surrounding towns and a third
 group simply chose the area for its   
 peace and tranquility together with   
 its easy access to both local market  
 towns and London.
