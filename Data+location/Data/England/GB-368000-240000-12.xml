		<title>12WELLINGTON HEATH HISTORY</title>
		<content> Wellington Heath was mentioned in the 
{Rent Book of the Bishop of Hereford,  
 known as the Red Book, in 1288.  It   
 was called Walynton, after{John de    
{Walynton}who held his land by military
 tenure. The heath was used for grazing
 until the 18 C when it was  occupied  
 by{squatters,}attracted to the site   
 by the new{Ledbury Canal.}Later these 
 sqatters bought their own freehold    
 under the{Ledbury Enclosure Act}of    
 1815.
