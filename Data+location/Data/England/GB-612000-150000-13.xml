 Rectory on Vicarage Hill, Petham. He  
 serves a{group of Church of England   
{churches}including the three churches 
 at Petham, Lower Hardres and Upper    
 Hardres covered by the survey. Weekly 
 services are held at the Churches. At 
 Petham this means a morning service   
 alternating with an evening service.  
 There is a choir which leads the      
 singing and a group  of bellringers.

 the services and sacraments in the    
 churches, Rev R. Love, the present    
 incumbent, takes a weekly morning     
 assembly in the local Primary Schools.
