		<title>04Michelle a girl in Ponteland</title>
		<content> I am a girl of nine years old and I   
 live in Ponteland in the county of    
 Northumberland which is part of North 
 East England.I have one sister who is 
 younger than me.On a Saturday I often 
 get up early and go in the wagon which
 my father drives.He sometimes carries 
 livestock and at other times he       
 delivers parcels and boxes.We quite   
 often travel a long way from home to  
 places like Alnwick,30 miles or       
 Berwick,60 miles away.Both these towns
 are North of us.When I go with my     
 father I get up at 5 o'clock and for  
 my breakfast I have cereal and a glass
 of milk.My father and mother have     
 fried bacon and egg with a drink of   
 tea or coffee.I wear a T-shirt which  
 is made of cotton and has printing on 
 it,instead of a skirt I wear blue     
 denim jeans.My socks are bright       
 colours with shoes called trainers.   </content>
