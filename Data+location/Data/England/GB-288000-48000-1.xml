 beautiful wooded estuary and a good   
 harbour.Big ships can come in         
 because of the deep water. Crabbing   
 and fishing is an important           
 industry.The Dart Valley Railway runs 
 steam trains from Paignton to         
 Kingswear for all the summer holiday  
 makers.Kingswear is a quiet village   
 except for the Lower Ferry queue,it   
 has some local shops,a Yacht Marina   
 and Yacht Club.The South side of

 former hotel is now time-share flats.
