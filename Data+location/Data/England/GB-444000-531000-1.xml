		<content> The area and environment which our    
 study covers for the{Domesday Project}
 is mainly a farming area with two     
 small villages in it and a scattering 
 of farms. There is a busy road,the   {
{A19,}which passes through it from     
 North to South. A deep dene or        
 ghyll,which is wooded,crosses from the
 North-West corner to the South-East   
 corner of our twelve square           
 kilometres. The land is about two to  
 three hundred feet above sea level and
 over-looks{Hartlepool}and{Teesside }  
 which is a few miles away. People who 
 live here,apart from the farmers,     
 almost all work outside our area. The 
 area was first settled by the Saxons  
 and{Elwick}and{Dalton Piercy}are      
 Saxon names of the two villages in the
 area.People regard the Villages as    
 attractive places both to live in and 
 to visit.                             </content>
