Most of the sculptures laid out in the sculpture trails of the 1970s have faded back into the landscape, as the materials from which they were made, mostly wood, have decayed away. One notable exception is the ‘Ancient Forester’ near the Grizedale Visitor Centre, which has been recently rejuvenated. A few sculptures such as ‘Ting’ and ‘Take the Wall for a Walk’ survive because they are made of stone and are hence more durable, although these are now often obscured by thick vegetation.&lt;br />&lt;br />The most accessible sculpture trail, the Millwood Trail, has been loved to death and is in serious need of regeneration. Grant funding has recently been acquired to revitalise this area.&lt;br />&lt;br />Grizedale Arts is a separate organisation from the forestry and has new headquarters at Lawson Park, an isolated former farmhouse on the Coniston side of the forest. Here, artists-in-residence create new sculptures for the f orest.   &lt;br />
