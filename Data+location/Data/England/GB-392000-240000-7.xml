		<content> Woke 7.15, I washed, dressed then made
 breakfast and lunch-boxes.Nils left   
 for work. Children dressed while I    
 did chores then they played the       
 organ. 8.30 Nick went to school,      
 Jessica came, I fed the rabbit, then  
 took the girls to Alex's to play. I   
 went and supervised playgroup. A      
 student came this week. It rained     
 outside so we played with water       
 indoors. Water went everywhere. Then I
 collected the girls and went home.    
 12.45 The girls had cakes for lunch ( 
 which they made at Alex's).William    
 arrived. After washing up, sorting the
 laundry and completing the PPA        
 questionaire, I spent the afternoon   
 telling stories. 3.15 We walked up to 
 the school past the water authority's 
 'Hole-in-the-road'. At school I       
 collected eggs. On the way back from  
 school we went to the PO to buy sweets</content>
