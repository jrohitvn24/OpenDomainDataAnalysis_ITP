		<content> Later on we may play on the piano or  
 Sarah, Clare, Wendy, Jo and me all    
 have bikes and we play on them. After 
 that we play with the dogs. Sarah has 
 one called Basil, Clare has one called
 Emma, my brother has one called Ben   
 and I have one called Tina. Ben joins 
 in the fun as I always look after him.
 We then play{52 In. 52 In}is when     
 someone stands by a post and counts to
 52 while everyone else hides. When    
 they have finished counting they start
 to look for you. The people that hid  
 have got to try to get to the post    
 before the person who was on it and   
 shout{"52 IN",}and the last person to 
 get to the post shouts{"52 IN SAVE    
{ALL".}We all stay out to eight except 
 me and Wendy. We go in and play chess 
 or something. Then about half past    
 nine I go up to my bedroom and read or
 play records and tapes. Then I sleep. </content>
