		<title>14Transport in the Hurn block.</title>
		<content> In Holbeach Hurn village itself there 
 is no public transport at all.One     
 service bus does come through the     
 block.That is the market day bus that 
 comes through Holbeach St. Marks and  
 down the marsh road twice a week on   
 Thursdays and Saturdays.It is run by  
 one of the local coach operators and  
 not by Lincolnshire Road Car.This bus 
 goes into Holbeach in the morning and 
 comes back at about 3 o'clock.School  
 children are entitled to free         
 transport and are picked up in the    
 centre of Holbeach Hurn or at         
 appointed stopping places along the   
 route.Apart from this people have to  
 rely on their own transport and a     
 second vehicle is not uncommon.Often  
 it is a van or landrover used in      
 connection with work.Nearly everyone  
 owns and uses a bike.Mr.Jenkinson runs
 a minibus into Holbeach on Saturdays. </content>
