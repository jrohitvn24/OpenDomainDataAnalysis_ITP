		<title>01BASILDON: NORTH EAST AREA</title>
		<content>{Basildon,}mentioned in the original   
{Domesday Book,}is approximately 30    
 miles from London. It was designated a
{New Town}following the end of the     
 Second World War, when London was     
 unable to cope with the housing of    
 returning servicemen and their        
 families.                             
                                       
 This north east area is a mixture of  
 farmland to the north, a central belt 
 of light industry, and housing and    
 recreational space to the south. It   
 has no real character because the     
 movement of people in and out of the  
 area has not allowed a real community 
 spirit to develop.                    
                                       
 The local areas are Nevendon, Cranes  
 Farm, Burnt Mills, Fryerns, Northlands
 and North Benfleet.
