		<content>    The{*MASTER COPY*}shows the number 
 of houses visited.It shows the results
 of the survey in Ansley.              
    Of 110 families, 60 were villagers 
 and 50 were incomers. 30 had stayed   
 because of work in the local area, 50 
 because of social reasons and the     
 others because of family reasons. Of  
 course many said all three.           
    The village still appears to have  
 the community spirit of a small       
 village, because when I called into a 
 local shop there was a notice on the  
 door thanking all of the people who   
 contributed to a wreath for a local   
 man who had died.                     
    Also there was to be a street party
 and requests were being made for      
 assistance.
