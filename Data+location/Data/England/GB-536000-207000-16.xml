 betwen the ages of 5 and 11. There are
 7 classes of infants and juniors and a
 Special Unit taking up to 10 children 
 with speech and language difficulties.
 The present headteacher has been at   
 the school for 3 years although the   
 school celebrates its 21st. birthday  
 this year. The school building stands 
 on the site of Westfield House, built 
 in Queen Victoria's reign. There also 
 used to be a windmill on the site and 
 that is why the school badge has a    
 windmill on it. There are several old 
 chestnut trees in the grounds and two 
 cedar of lebanons that once stood in  
 the grounds of the house.
