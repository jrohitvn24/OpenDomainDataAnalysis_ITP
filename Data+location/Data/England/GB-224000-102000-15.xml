		<content>  The area of Borough was mentioned in 
 the Domesday Book as Burrow. It is    
 thought that Burrow means hill fort   
 and the local residents presume that  
 there was a fort situated on the top  
 of the hill above Borough in ancient  
 times.                                
                                       
  The Bude Haven canal runs through    
 Shernick farm with a couple of small  
 ponds where the boats used to pass.   
 There also used to be two bridges over
 it for cattle to use but these have   
 now been taken down. There are a few  
 remains of the farmhouse known as     
 Lower Shernick which farmed the lower 
 land and there used to be a small dam 
 on the River Tamar to direct water    
 along a leet to Bridgerule to drive a 
 saw mill.
