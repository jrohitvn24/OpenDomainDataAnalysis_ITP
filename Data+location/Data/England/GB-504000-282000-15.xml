		<title>15 Barnwell Entertainers</title>
		<content>                                       
 Barnwell Entertainers are having a    
good year in 1985. Post-Christmas      
revellers enjoyed their fourth annual  
pantomime, "Cinderella", in January.   
Six months later, in June, came their  
ever-so-slightly-saucy production of   
"The Continental Quilt" - a bedroom    
farce in which the goings on in a      
bachelor flat caused much merriment    
for three appreciative full house      
audiences.  Plans are now under way    
for the next pantomime, which will     
doubtless be the most splendid yet, as 
the 5m x 3m stage creaks and the walls 
of the Reading Room expand to          
accommodate almost the whole           
population of Barnwell.
