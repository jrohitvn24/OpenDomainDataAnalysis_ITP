		<title>19CHANGES IN DEBDEN</title>
		<content>      Mrs.Glen Heath and Mrs.Jean      
 Bunting are sisters-in-law who have   
 lived in the area all their lives.They
 have seen very many changes.When they 
 were young they used to play out on   
 the roads,but there is too much       
 traffic today.                        
      Many more people live here now.  
 When Mrs.Heath and Mrs.Bunting were   
 young they knew everybody in the      
 village,but now there are too many to 
 know them all.There used to be two    
 shops,as well as an undertakers,a shoe
 mender,and a prison.                  
      Whenever they wanted to go out of
 the village they used to go on their  
 bicycles,but now they can go by car.  
      Mrs.Heath and Mrs.Bunting think  
 that the proposed new development of  
 housing to be built at{"Highfields"}is
 a good idea as it will make more homes
 for young people.                     </content>
