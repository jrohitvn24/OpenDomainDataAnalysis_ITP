		<title>13Oceanography at Bidston.</title>
		<content>    We  visited  Bidston  Institute  of
 Oceanography  and  were  told of their
 specialised scientific work. Our group
 sat inside the Old Observation Dome.  
   Research vessels are  used  off  our
 coasts and instruments specially  made
 for  measuring   currents , tides  and
 storm surges.This  information  is for
 the Ministry of Defence (Navy) fishing
 boats, yachts, Port Authorities. These
 people need  the  information  as they
 sail with  high  tides  or  must  know
 about  shipdocking  arrangements , and
 the moving  of oil rigs. We saw a buoy
                                       
 for measuring  currents, under repair.
   The Institute began predicting tides
 in  1867  and  now  predict two  years
 ahead.These are sent to 50 major , 200
 secondary British  ports  and  some in
 Australia . Fifty  percent  of  the   
 predictions made are for Europe.      </content>
