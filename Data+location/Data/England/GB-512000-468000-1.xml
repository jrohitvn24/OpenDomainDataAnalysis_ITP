		<content> This area is a farming area. It has 7 
 main farms. The main crops they grow  
 are wheat, barley, oil seed rape,     
 potatoes, cabbages and turnips. There 
 are some milking cows and sheep as    
 well. The farm houses were mainly made
 of chalk but the farmers have built   
 brick extensions on some of them and  
 have modernised them. Most of the     
 farmers only employ 1 or 2 workers and
 use a lot of farm machinery. The      
 village of Boynton is in this area.   
 There are 143 people living in 32     
 houses. There are no shops, there is  
 no post office but there is a school  
 and a church. There are 30 children in
 this school who come from Boynton,    
 Rudston and Grindale. They come to    
 school on a daily school bus. Most    
 people go into Bridlington for        
 shopping.
