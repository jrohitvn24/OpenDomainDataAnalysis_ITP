		<title>20Avon Ring Road_Hanham Area</title>
		<content> After public meetings and many written
 replies Avon County Council have      
 decided on a route for a{major road}on
 the eastern side of Bristol which is  
 hoped will relieve traffic congestion 
 for a mere 40 million pounds.Other    
 advantages for this road,which will   
 cut a swathe through green fields and 
 houses,would be to form a corridor of{
{development.}The Avon Wildlife Trust  
 and other groups are against the      
 planned route as it will cut through  
 Hanham Hills which has withstood      
 development as an island in a sea of  
 houses and industry. The{loss of      
{habitat}for wildlife,the increased    
 pollution and noise and reduction of  
 open space concerns many local people.
 The opposition to this scheme is      
 summed up by the title of a 10 year   
 old child's poem about the Ring Road{ 
{"Construction - Destruction!" }       </content>
