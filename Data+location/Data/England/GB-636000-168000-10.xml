		<title>10    Sub-Post Office</title>
		<content>    As well as the main post office in 
 Broadstairs, we have a small local    
 post office selling all kinds of      
 things, including envelopes, stamps,  
 sweets, cards, tobacco, etc.          
    The people who run it live above   
 the shop. It is always busy as most   
 people around here are retired and    
 cannot travel very far. There is      
 always a long queue at the door at    
 opening time, and the queue goes out  
 into the street on the days when old  
 people collect their pensions.        
    It is open all day except at lunch 
 time, from 9 a.m until 5.30 p.m. The  
 building is quite old and has always  
 been a shop. Three people work there  
 at present.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
