  Golfers at Fairthorne Manor's course 
 were asked for their opinions of the  
 course.  They thought that the course 
 was second rate and could be improved 
 drastically.                          
   One golfer said that dogs should    
 either work or be looked after        
 properly.  Another said that dogs     
 should either work or roam free, so   
 that the money spent on meat for dogs 
 could be sent to starving countries.  
    One golfer expressed his opinions  
 on nuclear war, saying it was horrific
 to think about, but he would rather   
 die than survive after a nuclear war. 
 He said nuclear war was a waste of    
 money.  We should be using natural    
 resources and experimenting to do     
 greater things with materials like    
 water.
