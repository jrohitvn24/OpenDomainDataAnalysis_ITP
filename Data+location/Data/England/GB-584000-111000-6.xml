		<content> The 60 acres of Mallydams Wood Nature 
 Reserve, Fairlight, East Sussex was   
 given to the RSPCA in l960 by Horace  
 Quick, a retired teacher.   It has    
 been a nature reserve with a resident 
 warden since l962.                    
                                       
 In l974 the Field Centre was built to 
 provide accommodation and equipment   
 for visiting groups from schools and  
 other organisations studying the      
 wildlife.   The Centre has two full   
 time staff; John Goodman, the resident
 warden and Nigel Ford, the Education  
 Officer.                              
                                       
 Mallydams is open to the public one   
 day a year, usually in September.     
 There is an l8 point nature trail     
 through part of the Reserve for       
 visitors to follow.  The Centre is    
 very popular with children.           </content>
