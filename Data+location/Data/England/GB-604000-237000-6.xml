		<title>06EDUCATION:WENHAM AND RAYDON</title>
		<content>There is no school in Great Wenham so  
children of primary school age attend  
Capel St.Mary primary school.Secondary 
school age children attend East        
Bergholt High School until the age of  
16 when they transfer to sixth form    
colleges in Ipswich if they wish to    
continue their education.Some children 
attend independant or fee paying       
schools in Ipswich.                    
In Raydon the village school closed in 
the summer of 1984 after 100 years.It  
was opened in 1884 as a National       
school.The falling school roll had     
caused the county education department 
to take this step and now primary      
school children are conveyed by bus out
of the village to Stratford St.Mary    
where a new primary school was opened  
in the autumn of 1984.The last         
headteacher of Raydon primary was      
peripatic,Mr.Shermer.                  </content>
