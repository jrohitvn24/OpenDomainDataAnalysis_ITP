		<title>09CARS IN KEYSOE</title>
		<content>      In our survey there are 100      
 adults and 37 children.  About 26     
 families have more than one car.      
     Why is this?                      
     They need the cars because of     
 where they work. 17 people work in    
 Bedford,6 in Sharnbrook,1 goes to     
 Cambridge and 1 travels to Milton     
 Keynes.  They also need the cars when 
 they go shopping.  Of the people we   
 asked 30 families buy their groceries 
 in Bedford.  Only 1 person shops      
 locally.  For their meat 7 go to      
 Kimbolton and 22 go to Bedford. Even  
 for vegetables 10 shop in Bedford but 
 all the rest shop locally or grow     
 their own.                            
     For entertainment most people stay
 in the village or go to the local pub.
 Forms of transport used by Keysoe     
 people,apart from cars, are vans,     
 bicycles, buses and even a lorry.     </content>
