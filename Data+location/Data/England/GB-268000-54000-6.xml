		<content> Little apart from local activities    
 organised by the local groups such as 
 the Womens Institute, but Plymouth    
 boasts two{theatres,}Dartington has an
 amateur theatre, and Challaborough has
 a{sports complex. }All of these are   
 within reasonable travelling distance 
 for those with cars. The nearby       
 coastline is spectacular and has      
 many miles of easily walkable         
 footpaths. Dartmoor is another        
 source of natural enjoyment, but      
 mainly people have to make their own  
 entertainment, such as whist &amp;        
 beetle drives, barn-dances, etc.      
 There is a group of{Campanologists }  
 who travel the area giving recitals.  
 Horseriding is also widely            
 practised, with many local and        
 provincial competitions.
