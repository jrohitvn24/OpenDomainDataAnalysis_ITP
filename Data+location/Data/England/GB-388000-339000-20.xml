		<content>There are four blocks in Blurton High  
school, which are called Main, Tower,  
Technical and Hem Heath blocks. As     
first year pupils we study the         
following subjects in one week;        
Mathematics, English, French, General  
Science, P.E., Geography, Music,       
History, C.D.T., R.E., Home Economics, 
Computer Appreciation and Art and      
Craft. In some years girls may have    
different lessons to boys, but in the  
first year they do not. We have a house
system in which there are three houses,
Wedgewood (blue), Spode (red) and      
Minton (yellow). The houses mainly     
compete against each other in sporting 
activities. The school organises       
holidays for the pupils, and there are 
other activities which include drama,  
chess, bird watching, brass band,      
choir, and computer club.
