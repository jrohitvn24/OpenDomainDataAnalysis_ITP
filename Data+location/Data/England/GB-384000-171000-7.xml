		<content> The farmland covers about 2,300 acres 
 divided 1/3 grassland and 2/3 arable. 
 The grassland supports 200 dairy cows 
 plus the young replacemnt cattle and a
 smaller number of beef cattle. With   
 the addition of cereal concentrates   
 the milk production is around 250,000 
 gallons annually.                     
 The arable land is cropped with       
 wheat, barley and a small acreage of  
 oilseed rape and peas.The corn output 
 is around 1000 tons of wheat and 2,500
 tons of barley.                       
 There are five farms based in the     
 parish with land from others running  
 across the boundary. The land is      
 mainly worked by the people who own it
 and very few hired men.               
 With the use of modern techniques and 
 high inputs of fuel,fertilizers and   
 chemicals the farmland is producing   
 more than at any other time in history</content>
