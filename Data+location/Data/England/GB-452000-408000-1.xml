		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content> The three main areas of habitation in 
 this area are Skellow, Carcroft and   
 Adwick-le-Street.Originally           
 agricultural communities they grew and
 developed with the opening of the     
 Bullcroft and Brodsworth mines. The   
 former being closed in 1970.The most  
 recent industrial developments in     
 the area relate to the Industrial     
 Estate which covers 570 acres.New     
 housing has developed particularly in 
 Adwick and Skellow.These provide      
 housing for people who work in the    
 nearby towns.These developments       
 have been helped by the fact that the 
 A1(M) London to Edinburgh road ,which 
 links with the M62 runs through the   
 western edge of this area. The        
 fly_over at the intersection of the   
 Doncaster by-pass with the A638       
 Doncaster to Wakefield road was built 
 only in 1979.                         </content>
