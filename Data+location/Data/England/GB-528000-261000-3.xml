 aged 4-11 and is a Church of England  
 Aided School. It is a new building and
 is well equipped, with a playground,  
 playing field and open air swimming   
 pool. There is also a playgroup on

 There are 4 classes who have the use  
 of 5 classrooms and a hall. The school
 has its own kitchen and Cook; children
 may either purchase a school dinner or
 eat their own packed lunch.           
 The school serves the four parishes of
 Elsworth, Boxworth, Conington and     
 Knapwell, but almost a third of the   
 children come from outside the catch- 
 ment area. The school is used by      
 village organisations in the evening.

 Swavesey or Comberton Village         
 Colleges.
