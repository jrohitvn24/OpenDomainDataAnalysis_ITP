		<content> The family pattern varies a great deal
 according to circumstances such as    
 employment and status of parents. Most
 families will have a cooked breakfast 
 probably with cereal. During term time
 most children stay at school for      
 cooked lunch or packed lunch. A cooked
 evening meal and light supper are     
 normal and some families buy in       
 Chinese or Indian meals, or fish and  
 chips. Traditional Sunday lunch is    
 still enjoyed although some will go   
 out to eat.                           
    Central heating is common although 
 some families still have open fires. A
 high proportion have T.V's, telephones
 and cars. Automatic washers and tumble
 dryers are now widely used.           
   More people go abroad on holiday but
 unemployment prevents some.           
   There are more broken homes through 
 separation and divorce.               </content>
