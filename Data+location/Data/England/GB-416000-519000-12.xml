		<title>12New Housing</title>
		<content>    In 1984 nine new houses were built 
 in Ingleton on Hillside Stack Yard and
 the same builders are starting to     
 build 21 houses and bungalows behind {
{Manor House}.Other new bungalows were 
 built on the south side of the        
 village.                              
    All the other villages in the area 
 have stone built properties dating    
 from the 1600's.No new properties are 
 being built, except two are planned   
 for Headlam, as the area is listed as 
 a {Conservation Area}.Several houses  
 in the area are being modernised.     
    In contrast to these new houses    
 there is {Killerby Hall}built 250     
 years ago and {Hilton Hall}built 800  
 years ago.
