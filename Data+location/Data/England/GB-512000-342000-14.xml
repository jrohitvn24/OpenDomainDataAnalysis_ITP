		<content> At the age of eleven the children     
 leave the local primary school and    
 travel by bus or train to secondary   
 schools in the town of Sleaford or    
 Billingborough, a village nine miles  
 to the south.                         
 The children are selected either for  
 the grammar schools,Carre's Boys or   
 Kesteven and Sleaford Girl's High, or 
 secondary modern schools,The Aveland  
 School Billingborough or St.George's  
 School Sleaford. Between the ages of  
 sixteen and eighteen further education
 is provided by a joint sixth form in  
 Sleaford or colleges of further       
 education in Grantham,Lincoln or      
 Boston.                               
 Of the six secondary schools in the   
 area(those above and Ruskington       
 Sec.Modern and The Lafford School,    
 Billinghay)it is likely that two will 
 close due to a 14% fall in numbers.   </content>
