		<content>     On 2nd July 38 children and 9     
adults went to "Bekonscot" near        
Beaconsfield to walk through the model 
village.It had a church and a          
windmill,a castle and some trains. We  
were amazed at the hard work that must 
have gone into the making of those     
buildings.      Then we got back on    
the coach and  went to Windsor.We got  
on a large boat which we had to        
ourselves.We had our picnic lunch as   
the boat sailed to Maidenhead.It took  
1.5 hours to travel 7 miles.We went    
through two locks and  were fascinated 
to see the boat rising as the water    
level changed.We saw moorhens and      
ducks and geese and weirs  and         
fishermen.      The day was sunny and  
warm so we did not need our coats.We   
bought drinks on the boat and threw    
our crumbs to the ducks.We got back at 
3p.m.                                  </content>
