		<title>02Desford Village (Part1)</title>
		<content> Desford is a large village with an old
 centre with a church and some cottages
 dating from 13th century. There have  
 been 3 large{housing}developments to  
 the S.E. of the village, trebling the 
 size of the village. Most of the      
 population work out of the village,   
 many in Leicster and others the nearby
 factories of Tubes and Caterpiller.   
 The village has strong{mining}        
 traditions and many miners still live 
 here although they have to travel to  
 N.Warwickshire and S.Derbyshire to    
 work.
