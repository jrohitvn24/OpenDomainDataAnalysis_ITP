		<content> He has{blue}eyes that are very good   
 considering he is 88.He didn't walk   
 slowly as you might think and he      
 walked uprightly which made him seem  
 very tall.His nose was sort of hooked.
 He had dark skin with no spots(that I 
 noticed anyway).His skin was wrinkled 
 but they were soft wrinkles.When we   
 went we discovered that there was a   
 lot more to bee-keeping than we       
 realised.                             
 The {Buckfast Bee}is a special breed  
 notified as a species.They breed the  
 queens at hexworthy. They are exported
 all over the world and especially to  
 Scandinavia and the USA. The workers  
 are all females.In the summer they    
 live for about five weeks.They live   
 longer in the winter because there    
 isn't so much work to do.The drones   
 die when they mate because some       
 vital tissues are ripped out.         </content>
