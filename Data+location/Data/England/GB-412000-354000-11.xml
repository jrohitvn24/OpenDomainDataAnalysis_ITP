		<content>{Vandalism in Alstonefield}            
     Visitors to Alstonefield sometimes
knock down walls, damage grassland,    
hurt wildlife, chase farm animals until
they die of exhaustion, leave gates    
open allowing animals to roam free and 
perhaps be knocked over by cars or     
hurt in some other way, let their dogs 
off their leads, allowing them to      
chase sheep and hens and generally be  
a pest to all the village.             
                                       
{School closed at Alstonefield}        
     Most children from Alstonefield go
to Warslow First and Middle Schools.   
They used to go to St. Peter's School  
in Alstonefield.  The school closed in 
12, because there were not enough      
children going there.  This affected   
the village in that the children had   
to go to another school and there      
would be no more social meeting.       </content>
