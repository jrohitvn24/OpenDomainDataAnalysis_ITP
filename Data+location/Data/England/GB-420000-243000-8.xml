 In Ilmington{May Day}has been observed
 as a day of celebration for a very    
 long period.It is still maintained by 
 the local school and it is a special  
 day on their calendar when country    
 dances are performed around the{      
{Maypole},with all the traditional     
 characters.In Autumn a{Harvest        
{Festival}is held in church and later  
 the school has its own service.The    
 children bring produce which is then  
 divided between all of the old people 
 and delivered to them.Ilmington has   
 strong links with the{Morris dancing} 
 world _ a local side can be traced    
 back as far as the 17th century.There 
 was a lull in its activities when{Sam 
{Bennet},a famous local dancer,died but
 it has since been revived and it is   
 thriving.The dancers can often be seen
 performing in villages locally.       </content>
