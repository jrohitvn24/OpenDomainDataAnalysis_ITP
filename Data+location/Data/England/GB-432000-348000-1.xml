 The{Belper Mill}is on the North border
 and our area lies between here and{   
{Ambergate.}The area is mainly hilly   
 and is mostly farmland with a few     
 housing estates of council and private
 homes. Other parts are built up and   
 industrial.                           
     The Mill stands by the side of the
 River Derwent from where the original 
 Mill got its power. It was built by   
{Jedediah Strutt}whose family changed  
 Belper from the centre of the nail    
 trade to the centre of the cotton     
 industry. There is the{Riverside      
{Pavilion}used for social events and   
 the{Riverside Gardens,}both near      
 the Mill.                             
     On Crich Lane there is{Ridgeway   
{Hospital}and across from the hospital 
 is a factory,which produces plastic.  </content>
