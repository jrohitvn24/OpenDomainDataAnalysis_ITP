 Tilbury is about 33,524. Tilbury gets 
 most of its jobs and money from the   
 power station and the docks.It is     
 built on marshy ground which means    
 there are still some uncovered areas  
 of marsh.There are quite a few house  
 building schemes which are still under
 construction There is a railway       
 station on the edge of town. In the   
 town there are assorted shops,schools 
 ,leisure centre facilities and        
 emergency services. Also near the sea 
 wall there is a ferry dock            
  platform. Next to the ferry docking  
 platform there is a place where large 
 ships can deliver there cargo.
