		<content> Every morning my mum wakes me up at   
{7 o clock.}I have cereal for breakfast
 and then have a wash and get dressed. 
 Next I read my book and then pack my  
 bag and get ready for school. When my 
 brother is ready we leave. My dad     
 leaves for Peterborough at the same   
 time. When we get to school we wait   
 for the whistle and then go in and sit
 down while the register is called. We 
 assemble in the hall and first we sing
 a hymn. My favourite hymn is{Living   
{Lord.}Then we have a story about      
 caring. Back in the classroom we do   
 mathematics and write a story. In the 
 afternoon we have music and listen to 
 a story. During playtime I sometimes  
 play{French Skipping.}We go home at   
 3.30. I have my tea and sometimes go  
 up to see the horses in the field. I  
 like{horse riding}very much.          
 Afterwards I usually go to bed.       </content>
