		<content> The{Hurstbourne Tarrant and District  
{Horticultural Society}was founded in  
 1930 to organise an annual Flower     
 Show. In 1933 it made a profit of Â£50 
 and it was held successfully for many 
 years in the meadow behind the school.
 The expense of hiring a marquee,and   
 staging a large outdoor event became  
 prohibitive, and the tradition lapsed.
 During this period the{Whist Club}was 
 formed to provide continuity for the  
 group, and to help raise funds to     
 restart the Society. In 1985 this is  
 being achieved, a Flower Vegetable and
 Produce Show will be held for the     
 first time as an indoor event, in the 
 aisle barn at Ibthorpe Manor Farm in  
 September.                            
 The{Mother's Union}meets monthly but  
 not in August. It holds open meetings 
 for about 15 members. It is affiliated
 to groups in Britain and abroad.      </content>
