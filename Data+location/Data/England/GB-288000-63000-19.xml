		<content> Pupils and staff from the following   
 schools were involved in his survey:  
                                       
{Ellacombe Primary                     
{Shiphay Primary                       
{Upton St.James Primary                
{Torquay Boys' Grammar                 
                                       
 Our special thanks to the pupils      
 concerned who did most of the foot    
 slogging and the writing. So many were
 involved that it is impossible to     
 mention all by name. The teachers did 
 a great job overseeing the whole thing
 and quite enjoyed themselves as well.
