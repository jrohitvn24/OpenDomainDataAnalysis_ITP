		<title>10FURTHER NAVY USE IN GRID 05</title>
		<content> The land in this square is owned by   
 the Ministry of Defence and is part of
 The Royal Naval Armament Depot,       
 Frater.  Crossing this land is a      
 railway line which is maintained by   
 the Ministry of Defence for service   
 purposes and is linked  to the main   
 railway line through Fareham.  There  
 are several piers which are used for  
 loading armaments onto ships.  This   
 section of the coastline is restricted
 to Ministry of Defence use.  The land 
 is not all built up - there is a long 
 established heronry sited in an area  
 of deciduous woodland.
