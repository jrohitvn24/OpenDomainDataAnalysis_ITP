		<content> The village of Middlezoy is built on  
 rising ground formed by the intrusion 
 of blue lias rock through the         
 surrounding peat and sand layers of   
 Sedgemoor.  This is part of a ridge   
 of rock on which the villages of      
 Chedzoy, Westonzoyland, Middlezoy,    
 Middlezoy and Othery lie; the whole   
 area being known as the island of     
 Sowey.  The highest point in Middlezoy
 (Windmill Hill) is only 30m above the 
 surrounding moor which is at, or just 
 below, sea level.  Over the years     
 Middlezoy has expanded little, and    
 although during the last 40 years     
 approximately 60 houses have been     
 built, these are all within the old   
 village boundaries, having been built 
 on old orchards, farmyards etc. as    
 infill.
