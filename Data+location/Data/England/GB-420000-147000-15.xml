		<title>15FARMING IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  All the farms and farmland are owned 
 by the Army and leased out. There are 
 large areas of cultivated grassland   
 which are used as pasture for grazing 
 dairy cattle such as Friesians and    
 Herefords, also sheep and horses. A   
 small amount of the farmland is used  
 for arable farming for cash crops and 
 there are a few wheatfields scattered 
 over the area. There is some pheasant 
 breeding carried out to support the   
 local game shooting.
