		<title>15FARMING IN CHELMONDISTON</title>
		<content> We have 350 acres on our farm and     
three people help my Dad to work it.   
Sometimes I help too. We grow wheat,   
barley, potatoes and sugar-beet. We sow
the corn and potatoes in Spring and    
harvest the corn in July and the       
potatoes throughout the Summer. We sell
potatoes and eggs at the farm. This    
year we did not get as much money for  
our potatoes as we usually do. At      
Christmas, we sell geese and poultry.  
Grandma looks after the ducks and geese
We have two old pig buildings and we   
are building two more. We get them as  
weaners of about six weeks old. We feed
them on pig nuts and when they are big 
enough, we send them to market.We give 
them straw to lie on. We bale the straw
after we have combined the corn. The   
small bales we store in a barn and the 
round bales are kept out-side.
