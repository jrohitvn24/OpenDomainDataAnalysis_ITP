		<content>  Chesterfield has been a market town  
 since 1204 but its main development   
 has been as an industrial town. This  
 is because there are coal mines around
 the town &amp; also supplies of iron ore. 
 Although there are no furnaces now and
 the work force much reduced at the big
 engineering works of Sheepbridge,Bryan
 Donkin, Staveley and Markham there has
 sprung up many small firms based on   
 the engineering, iron &amp; steel industr-
 ies. On Whittington Moor we have:     
 Metapic who pickle &amp; clean s/steel.   
 Fastnaparts who make nuts and bolts.  
 Chesterfield Special Steels Ltd. who  
 are steel stockholders.               
 The Valley Spring Co.Ltd. who make    
 coil springs of all sizes.            
 Ryro Engineering Co. who manufacture  
 parts for earth-moving equipment.
