		<title>04STRAWBERRIES IN FENLAND</title>
		<content> In 1985 atrocious spring weather      
 delayed the local{strawberry}crop.At  
 the end of June, N.F.U. Cambridgeshire
 horticultural secretary Mr. Godfrey   
 said,"The crop is already a fortnight 
 late and warmth and sunshine are      
 needed to swell the fruit.It looks    
 like being a short season and an      
 average crop." He also stated that    
 local canners would be ordering less  
 strawberries this year, though firms  
 which freeze fruit might be ordering  
 more. The managing director of        
 Smedleys and Lockwoods, two local     
 processing plants, confirmed that     
 demand is steadily{declining.}It is a 
 trend which has seen acreages of      
 strawberries in the Fenland area      
 reduced by 40% in the last few years. 
 The average price per ton this season 
 is around Â£400.
