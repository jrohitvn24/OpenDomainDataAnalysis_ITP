		<title>19TYWARDREATH PRIORY</title>
		<content> The{Priory at Tywardreath}was founded 
 before 1169. Benedictine monks from   
 Normandy came by boat as the Priory   
 was on the water's edge. The Priory   
 was in the lane near today's church   
 but no one knows exactly where. It was
 closed in 1536.                       
{Tywardreath means "House on the Sand"}
 because it used to be coastal. Most of
 Par was covered by water when the tide
 came in. The monks built the first    
 causeway from what is now St.Andrew's 
 Bridge to St. Blazey. 3 men were      
 drowned on the causeway in the 1300's,
 one was a monk, because they did not  
 check the tide. A ferry took people   
 from the bottom of Vicarage Rd. to the
 bottom of The Mount.                  
 The Priory made Tywardreath very      
 important in the area and the village 
 grew round the Priory.
