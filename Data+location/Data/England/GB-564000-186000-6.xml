		<title>06LAINDON WEST COMMUNITY HALL</title>
		<content> The children of our school use the    
 facilities of the{Laindon West        
{Community Centre,}Hoover Drive. Many  
 activities go on there, dancing       
 classes, playgroups,  bingo, youth    
 clubs, keep-fit, mother and toddler   
 groups, etc. Usually on a Saturday the
 centre is hired out for a wedding     
 reception. The centre is used by lots 
 of people of different ages from      
 babies to old age pensioners.         
 We interviewed{Mr.Paul Blake}who is   
 the{secretary}of the centre. His work 
 at the centre is voluntary. He is     
 helped by four adult volunteers. Mr.  
 Blake got involved with the centre    
 because he was concerned with what    
 goes on locally. He feels that        
 community centres in Laindon are      
 important. They are needed for young  
 people especially as there are few    
 facilities for them in Laindon.       </content>
