 to sign on, then on to the Job        
 Centre.It is a sorry sight to see so  
 many young people perusing the rows of
 pathetic deadend jobs in the hope that
 something will turn up. I must call in
 as the local dockyard recruit labour  
 through these centres. By now it will 
 be around 2p.m. and I may spend an    
 hour at the swimming baths or visit my
 mother. Next I will return home in    
 time to make the evening meal for the 
 family. After watching the news at 6  
 O'clock I may spend an hour or two in 
 the garden. By this time with evening 
 drawing in I may watch some           
 television, or play a game with the   
 children, or read a book untill       
 it is time to go to bed.
