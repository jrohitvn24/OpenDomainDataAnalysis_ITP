<title>21HMS Ganges</title>
<content>

HMS Ganges is now deserted, it has stood empty and unused for nearly ten years. There have been proposals to develop it as a residential estate but the infrastructure of Shotley village and Shotley Gate will not support it.&lt;br />&lt;br />So now it stands unused, the mast is still there and has a protection order on it so the owners are required to protect it as a historic monument although some 20 feet have broken off the top. The site looks very sad and sorry now and it's a real pity that a site of genuine Military and Historic interest that could have been a local resource is simply being allowed to moulder away.   &lt;br />
