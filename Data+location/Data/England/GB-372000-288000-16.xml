		<title>16RIVER SEVERN</title>
		<content>  The{River Severn}is a major feature  
 within this area. At this point it is 
 about{10 metres}wide and having left  
 the{Severn Gorge}it is now in The     
 "Valley" stage. The steep banks are   
 well vegetated with grass and bushes. 
 There are a large number of birds and 
 wild animals. After heavy rain the    
 river is prone to{flooding.           
  In the past, it was much used for    
 cargo but now its main use is for     
 canoeing and{salmon fishing.}The local
 rambling society regularly walks along
 the beautiful west bank, where there  
 is a footpath.                        
  The attraction of the river (and the 
 flat land) has been an influence on   
 the location of the{caravan site}at   
 Quatford.                             
  There are plans to make the river    
 navigable again as far up as          
 Bridgnorth.                           </content>
