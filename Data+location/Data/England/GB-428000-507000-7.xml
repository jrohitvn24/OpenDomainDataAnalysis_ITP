		<title>07SERVICES IN HURWORTH PLACE.</title>
		<content>   Croft Post Office, as well as a     
 number of other shops, are situated in
 Hurworth Place, and are used by       
 villagers from Croft, Dalton and      
 Hurworth Place. The shops offer the   
 usual general store produce, but there
 is also a wine store, a second-hand   
 goods shop and a hairdresser.         
   A mobile bread and confectionary van
 visits on Thursdays and Saturdays, and
 there are daily milk deliveries by    
 three dairies. Durham County Library  
 parks its van in the car park of one  
 of the hotels once a fortnight on     
 Wednesdays from 1.50 p.m. to 3.15 p.m.
 while a mobile video van is available 
 on Friday evenings.
