		<title>13Watford: Religion 1</title>
		<content> Over the last 10 to 15 years the      
 religious complexion of Watford has   
 changed.                              
                                       
 Christianity is still the predominant 
 overt religion, although there is an  
 apparent trend away from church based 
 worship, towards House Groups.        
                                       
 Catholicism and Anglicanism are still 
 the major groups with non-comformist  
 and Quaker meeting houses following.  
                                       
 Watford is also the national centre   
 for the Seventh Day Adventists.       
                                       
 Some christian churches are moving    
 into cross-religious discussion and   
 help, to the extent of offering church
 halls as multi-cultural centres.      
                                       
                                       </content>
