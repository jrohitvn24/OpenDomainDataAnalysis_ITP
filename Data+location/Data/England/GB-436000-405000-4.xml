		<title>04MY HOUSE IS SEMI-DETACHED.</title>
		<content> My house is a semi_detached.  We have 
 a chimney because we have a coal fire.
 It is made of bricks, with a tiled    
 roof. It is a{council house}and we pay
 rent. We have a washer.  When the     
 clothes have been washed my mum dries 
 them in the tumble dryer but on fine  
 days she pegs them on the line.  My   
 mam does most of the cooking.  My dad 
 can cook but only if he has to and he 
 is not as good as my mam.  My         
 favourate meal is{Sunday}dinner.  On a
{Sunday}evening my mam will make crisps
 sandwiches for tea. In the living room
 we have a video and a colour T.V.  We 
 have two bedrooms.  In my bedroom     
 there is a cupboard, two beds and some
 toys and a ghetto.  This is a large   
 radio.  My dad is{unenployed}and my   
 mam does not work.  I have one        
 brother.  He is called Scott.  Ilike  
 living in Lundwood.                   </content>
