		<title>07Abbotsley Pig Farm</title>
		<content> The Pig farm has about 1000 pigs,2    
 cows,1 calf,about 200 chickens,15     
 bullocks and 100 acres of arable and  
 grassland.They take 35 pigs to market 
 every Thursday.They go to St.Neots    
 market because it is the nearest.They 
 take them in a lorry.The market has   
 been in business since 1857,but it is 
 closing down this year.The farmer is  
 worried because there are no more     
 markets in the area.The 200 chickens  
 lay about 700 eggs a week.The cows    
 graze in a field on the farm and      
 produce a lot of milk for the calves  
 and the kitchen but the bullocks graze
 away from the farm.The farmer is      
 building new pig sties as they are    
 expanding.The farmer takes the manure 
 to the barley field. They grind       
 the barley into pig food.
