		<title>11Trade Mr. Sherry Greyhounds</title>
		<content> Alders Farm House is over a hundred   
 years old and was originally a        
 labourers cottage.   Mr. Sherry has   
 bred and trained greyhounds for 2\    
 years in Fyfield but previously bred  
 them in Ireland for twenty years. He  
 is more interested in training than   
 breeding the dogs. Sunny his oldest   
 dog has won every race it has run. It 
 is now seven years old and is treated 
 as a family pet. Mr. Sherry has       
 about 50 greyhounds. The greyhounds   
 have a breakfast consisting of tea and
 toast - sometimes they have an        
 egg with it. Vitamin tablets are      
 mixed in. For their main meal they    
 have soup soaked on to a rusk &amp; they  
 have meat too. The greyhounds are     
 worth a thousand pounds each.
