		<title>04BARNSLEY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Barnsley church is a pretty, small    
 church in a tidy graveyard. There are 
 services there every Sunday, although 
 the vicar is in charge of three       
 different churches Barnsley, Bibury   
 and Winson. The parish is called      
 Bibury.                               
    The earliest parts of Barnsley     
 church are Saxon, and you can still   
 see a small Saxon window from the     
 outside. The Normans enlarged the     
 church and it was changed again in the
 15th century to look as it does now.  
 The chancel was restored in 1956 in   
 memory of Linda Verey, a member of an 
 important local family and wife of the
 vicar.                                
    There are memorials to several     
 people in the church, with the same   
 names occurring often. Two of them are
 very interesting because they are the 
 tombs of baby twins who died in 1690. </content>
