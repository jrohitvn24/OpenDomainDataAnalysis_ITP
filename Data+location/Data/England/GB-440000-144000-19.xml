		<title>19Lower Mill Lparish</title>
		<content>{Lower Mill }was mentioned in the      
 Domesday Book of 1086.It was then a { 
{flour mill.}The old wood and metal    
 wheel of the {undershot}type was last 
 used in 1943 to produce {electricity  
{for the  house.}The miller's house has
 disappeared and in its place is a     
 sunken garden with a sundial.The old  
 building was extended about 60 years  
 ago and Lower Mill is now an          
 attractive brick house in an estate of
 27 acres.The main house and the lodge 
 are both heated by a large wood and   
 straw burning boiler which is kept    
 going throughout the year.The {old    
{orchards and glasshouses}have been re-
 placed by lawns and a wide variety of 
 trees brought from all over the world.
 Among these are a North American      
 Indian bean tree and a number of less 
 familiar species.
