   Regent's Canal is famous for it's   
narrow boats,locks and fish.There are  
many types of fish e.g pike,roach and  
perch.The most common caught,however,  
are rudd.Very rare ones are bream and  
jack-pike.I use different baits such as
maggots,sweetcorn and worms.The enemy  
of the angler is the eel and when one  
is caught you lose your hook in its    
guts.All the anglers return their fish 
gently.I get most fun out of catching  
perch as they put up the biggest fight.
   There are some locks and the fish   
wait for the barges to go through but  
the eels can go over the weirs.To fish 
you have to buy a yearly licence which 
cost five pounds.The Thames Water      
Authority own the canal and they have  
rules on the use of lead weights which 
can kill birds of the canal.Fishing is 
my favourite sport.                    </content>
