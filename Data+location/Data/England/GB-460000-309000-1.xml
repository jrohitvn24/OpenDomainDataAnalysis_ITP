		<title>01Barkby, Syston &amp; Thurmaston.</title>
		<content>   These 3 villages, together with the 
 hamlet of Barkby Thorpe, lie to the NE
 of Leicester. Originally they were    
 very separate but now Leicester,      
 Thurmaston and Syston form a          
 continuous built up area along the    
{Melton Road}(A 607).                  
   The{Six Hills Road}(A 46 -Fosse Way)
 now bypasses Thurmaston on its way to 
 Newarke and Lincoln. Running parallel 
 to this is the{River Soar}and the     
{Grand Union Canal.}Few roads run East 
 to West due to the extensive water-   
 meadows by the river which floods     
 regularly.                            
   Syston is the only village in the   
 group to have had a railway station   
 but this is now closed. Thurmaston    
 used to have two sets of private      
 sidings serving the brickworks but    
 these too have disappeared.
