		<title>15Martello Towers, Pevensey</title>
		<content> There are 4 Martello Towers standing  
 along the beach at Pevensey Bay.Towers
 were built every 500 yards(twice the  
 range of the cannon set on the top of 
 each).They were for{protection against
{Napoleonic}invasion.Many have been    
 demolished.Each tower is circular with
 a central pillar to support the       
 rotating cannon.On the sea side the   
 walls are 5m thick and on the landward
 side 4m.They are built with over      
 1million bricks,the mortar was mixed  
 with sand from the beach.One tower    
 will be incorporated into the{proposed
{Eastbourne Marina}development.One is a
 private dwelling and the other 2 are  
 being converted to{private homes.}They
 are{listed as ancient monuments,}which
 means they must not be altered        
 externally.One of these towers has a  
 legacy from World War 2,Canadian      
 soldiers put a gun emplacement on top.</content>
