		<content>  Eastnor is a very picturesque village
 which lies on the south westerly      
 slopes of the Malvern hills. The      
 scenery is dominated by the castle    
 built in 1812,and the lake in its     
 grounds.                              
  On an island in the lake stood the   
 old castle called Castle- ditch,its   
 foundations can still be located where
 it extended into what is now shallower
 water between the island and the      
 castle terraces.                      
  The park is full of red deer and is a
 beautiful tourist area attracting     
 groups of campers and caravanners.    
  The village has a charming thatched  
 post office,and the other buildings   
 are old.The focal part of the village 
 is the village primary school and     
 village green.
