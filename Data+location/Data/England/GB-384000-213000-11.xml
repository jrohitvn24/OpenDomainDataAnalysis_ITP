		<title>11Playground Games (cont)</title>
		<content> In the game ice_cream five or six     
 people line up at the end of the      
 playground, One person stands at the  
 other end with their back facing the  
 chilren.They have to try and tag him  
 without him seeing them.He will turn  
 around at any time to see if the other
 children are moving. When he does this
 the children have to stand still. If  
 he sees them moving he changes places 
 and then the game carries on. The     
 first to get to him without being     
 caught shouts "Icecream" and the rest 
 of the children have to run back up   
 the playground. If he tags anyone then
 they take his place and the game      
 starts again.
