		<content> practice for the big moment.          
  People in the crowd who had radio's  
 kept the crowd informed of the journey
 from Lincoln.  Suddenly the cars swept
 into view. The crowds cheered and the 
 flags waved. Then the cars stopped in 
 front of the building and the Princess
 got out. She was wearing a grey and   
 white vertically striped jacket with a
 grey skirt. Her hat was wide brimmed, 
 white with a grey band around the     
 brim.  Inside the building she met the
 residents and spent about an hour     
 talking to the staff and dignitaries  
 that were assembled. She was very     
 popular with all of the people and won
 many more fans by her relaxed         
 friendliness. After signing the       
 visitors book and a photograph sha    
 came outside and went on a short      
 walk-about. It was a most enjoyable   
 occasion.                             </content>
