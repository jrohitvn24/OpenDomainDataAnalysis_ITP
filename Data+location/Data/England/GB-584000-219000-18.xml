		<title>18FISHING ON THE BLACKWATER</title>
		<content> I am a member of Kelvedon and District
 Angling  Association. Behind where  I 
 live is the River Blackwater. It comes
 from Coggeshall to Kelvedon, it goes  
 through Easterford Mill and then goes 
 to Bridgefoot Mill. K.D.A.A. owns a   
 large number of lakes and rivers, such
 as Silver End Lake,which is one of my 
 favourite fishing spots.              
 My biggest fish to date is a chub     
 which weighed 2lb. 15oz. The river    
 Blackwater has many different species 
 of fish in it; such as roach, chub    
 dace, minnows, ruff, eels, gudgeon and
 perch. I have fished one match on the 
 Blackwater this season, in which I    
 came second. My brother came first in 
 the same match.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
