 The children had no toys only a few   
 books. They played out or talked to   
 their mother or father who would tell 
 them about his day and make them      
 laugh. The church ran an annual social
 with a band and dances like the       
 Valeta. It also ran a Christmas party.
 People did a turn at concerts. The    
 children had work to do at home.

 The children had Sunday School trips  
 in a horse and cart to East Knoyle and
 a Sunday School party. They would go  
 for a picnic in the woods with their  
 parents on Sunday but they would have 
 to bring back wood to burn.

 They had radios and dances in the     
 village hall. There wasn't much       
 entertainment because a lot had gone  
 to fight in the war.                  </content>
