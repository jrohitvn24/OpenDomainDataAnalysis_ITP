		<title>01OUR AREA</title>
		<content> The area we have studied is a{rural   
 area.It is  quite hilly and is mainly 
 covered by{woodland}and farmland.There
 are no housing estates or shopping    
 areas but lots of farms.Most of the   
 farms grow crops such as wheat and    
 barley,but some keep pigs and a few   
 sheep.There are two main roads running
 through the area,the A614 Ollerton    
 road and the A60 Mansfield road.They  
 are both very busy roads.As well as   
 the farms the main places of interest 
 in our area are:the{Burnstump country 
 park, the {Burnstump pub,Seven mile   
 house ,the{Police}Headquarters,the    
{Park private hospital}and the         
{Chinchilla ranch.
