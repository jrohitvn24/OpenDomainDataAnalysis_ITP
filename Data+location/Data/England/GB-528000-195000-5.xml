		<title>05Employment in West Enfield</title>
		<content>  This area is a dormitory suburb and  
 the majority of men are employed      
 outside the area, many of them        
 commuting to either the City or       
 the West End of London.Of these the   
 majority work for large companies.    
  There are no factories or dominating 
 industries in the area and the        
 majority of the men surveyed are in   
 fact self_employed either in a        
 professional capacity or in small     
 businesses.                           
  Approximately half of the women are  
 fully employed as housewives and      
 mothers.Of the rest,two thirds are    
 employed part_time either within the  
 area or close by.                     
  From necessity some women from one   
 parent families work full time and    
 these tend to work outside the area.  
 The rest of those employed full time  
 generally work in the area.           </content>
