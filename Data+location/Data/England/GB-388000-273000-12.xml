 School has a flourishing Parents      
 Association which was formed in 1978. 
 At first the association saw its roll 
 as an additional "fighting force" if  
 fears of school closure became a      
 reality. The ensuing years have seen  
 this roll change to a more passive and
 supportive one.                       
 They have held many fund raising      
 events in the village, ranging from a 
 stall at the village fete to coffee   
 evenings at members homes. They have  
 organised cricket and football        
 matches, barn dances and discos,      
 skittles, jewellery parties and many  
 raffles. The money raised was used to 
 pay for visits to Pantomimes, theatres
 and Nature and Wild Life centres. They
 have purchased, a computer,sports     
 equipment, books, cassette players,   
 cassettes, and a clock for the school.</content>
