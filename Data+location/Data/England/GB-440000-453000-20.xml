		<title>20HOUSING AND ITS EFFECTS.</title>
		<content> Most of the houses and land in the    
 area used to be owned by {Ribston     
{Estate.}Some of the houses have been  
 sold to private people.Some are let to
 people who work on the{Estate.}Others 
 are let to private tenants.Some of the
 farms are also let to private tenants.
 There are several houses that have    
 been built recently,some that have    
 been improved,and some that have been 
 converted from old buildings.There are
 also 4 council houses and 4 pensioners
 bungalows.There are some houses that  
 have been empty for a long time and   
 there are 2 derelict ones.The local   
 Planning Department(Harrogate District
 Council)has no plans to develop the   
 area for residential purposes.As      
 family size has decreased the         
 population of the area has also       
 dwindled,the school population has    
 shrunk so staffing has been reduced.  </content>
