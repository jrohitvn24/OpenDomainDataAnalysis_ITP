		<title>12Jersey Royal Potato 1.</title>
		<content> About lOO years ago the Jersey Royal  
 was first cultivated taking over from 
 cider to become the main agricultural 
 export. The Royal or "New Potato" is  
 popular because of its small kidney   
 shape and fresh taste. From digging to
 the U.K. market takes only 48 hours.  
 It is an early potato so its success  
 relies on its reaching the market     
 before the other varieties. To grow   
 well the Royal needs plenty of sun, a 
 little rain and no ground frost. Warm 
 humid weather can lead to potato      
 blight, so the crops are sprayed      
 against it, not always effectively.   
 Another threat is the black and yellow
 striped Colorado beetle which can     
 destroy the crop very quickly. It is  
 carried by easterly winds from France 
 to Jersey. If the beetle is seen the  
 whole island is on the alert because  
 of the damage it can cause.           </content>
