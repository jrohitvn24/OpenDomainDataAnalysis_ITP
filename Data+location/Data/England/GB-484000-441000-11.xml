		<title>11BIOGRAPHY OF M.W. CHARACTER</title>
		<content>      William Bradley was born in      
 Market Weighton in l787.  He was the  
 tallest Englishman ever recorded.  He 
 stood 7 feet 9 inches tall (2.36      
 metres) , and he weighed 27 stone.    
 His home still stands, but is now the 
 bicycle shop at the end of York Road. 
 The doors of his house had to be      
 specially heightened and special      
 furniture was made to accomodate him. 
 His chair still exists and is kept in 
 the "Bradley Bar" in the Londesborough
 Arms Hotel.  Also remaining is one of 
 his shoes which is exhibited at the   
 Castle Museum, York.  He died at the  
 age of 33 and is buried inside All    
 Saints Church, Market Weighton, due to
 the practice of body snatching in     
 those days.  Over his grave is a      
 commemorative plaque.
