		<title>02WALTER POWELL,SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   The man after whom our school is    
 named,Walter Powell,was a local M.P.  
 and magistrate from 1868 to 1881.He   
 was a popular "society" figure who    
 used his wealth to assist poor people 
 inthis area,including building reading
 rooms,subsidising coal prices and     
 paying for a "ragged school" in       
 Malmesbury.His home was in our area.  
   He was also famous for his interest 
 in ballooning which he used to assist 
 the Meteorological Office.He made his 
 own balloon from silk and flew it     
 locally.Sadly,on December 10th 1881 he
 was blown out to sea while ballooning 
 and was never seen again.             
   Our present school has an unusual   
 weather vane on its roof in the shape 
 of a balloon in memory of Walter      
 Powell.His association with the school
 continues through the interest of the 
 Powell Duffryn Company.               </content>
