		<title>17DISTRICT NURSE - HANWOOD</title>
		<content> The area covered by the local District
 Nurse includes Hanwood and Yockleton. 
 She is employed by{Shropshire Health  
{Authority}between 0830 and 1700 hours,
 Monday to Friday. She has worked the  
 area for 12 years. She cares for{house
{bound patients}including early        
 hospital discharges and the terminally
 ill.{75% of her patients are elderly. 
 Many of the latter are denied hospital
 places due to the lack of beds. This  
 places pressure on relatives paid     
 inadequate attendance allowances with 
 minimal holiday relief. Concern at no 
 provision for night nursing by the    
 Health Authority has led to the       
 formation of a{local charity - The    
{Nightingale Nurses}which raises funds 
 to pay for night time home nursing.   
 The District Nurse noted a greater    
 willingness and ability to cope with  
 illness in the rural areas.           </content>
