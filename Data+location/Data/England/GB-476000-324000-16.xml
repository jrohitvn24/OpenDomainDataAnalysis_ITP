		<title>16The Jubilee Way</title>
		<content> The Jubilee Way is a special walkers' 
 footpath.It was set up and opened to  
 celebrate{Queen Elizabeth II's Silver 
{Jubilee}in 1977.                      
   The footpath  starts at{Melton      
{Mowbray}in Leicestershire and passes  
 though Scalford, Goadby Marwood and   
 Eaton, finishing at{Woolsthorpe}in    
 Lincolnshire, where it joins up to the
 Viking way.Altogether the Jubilee Way 
 is about 24 kilometres long.          
    The footpath passes through quite a
 lot of our Block, leading through     
 meadowland and around crops, with many
 small bridges crossing streams. It is 
 not a difficult walk, so it is very   
 popular especially with groups        
 organising sponsored walks.           
    We have walked part of the Jubilee 
 Walk from School with our parents to  
 raise money for School Funds.
