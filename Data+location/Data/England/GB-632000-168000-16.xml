    THE FARM STRETCHES OVER 100 ACRES.

LAMBS 2000 CHICKENS, 50 CATTLE AND A   
COUPLE OF GEESE.THEY ALSO HAVE A FRUIT

1500 EGGS A DAY,BOTH BATTERY AND       
FREE-RANGE EGGS.THE CATTLE ARE USUALLY

    THE   FARMHOUSES AND BARNS.        
THERE ARE ONLY TWO ACTUAL FARMHOUSES ON
THE FARM WHICH DATE BACK FROM THE 17th 
CENTURY, BUT ARE KEPT IN BEAUTIFUL     
CONDITION, BUT THE OLD BARNS HAVE BEEN 
LEFT TO DETERIORATE. MOST OF THEM WERE 
MADE OF BRICK, WOOD AND SLATE. AT THE  
TIME WE VISITED THE FARM THEY WERE USED
TO KEEP ANIMALS IN OR THEY WERE        
BLOCKED.
