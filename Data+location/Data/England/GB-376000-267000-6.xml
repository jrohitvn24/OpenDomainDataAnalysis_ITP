		<title>06(CONT.) UNITED BENEFICE</title>
		<content>   There is an{unusual tablet}on the   
 wall of the north aisle depicting a   
 young girl sitting with a snake round 
 her arm. She died after being bitten  
 by an adder at Glasshampton.          
   Astley is part of {THE UNITED       
{BENEFICE OF SHRAWLEY AND WITLEY WITH  
{ASTLEY.}This scheme was proposed on   
 18th May 1982 and was published in The
 London Gazette on{27th MAY 1982.}The  
 parishes are in an interregnum at the 
 moment following the untimely death of
 the Rector,{CANON J.G.BARNISH,}earlier
 this year(1985).                      
   Astley is very much a separate      
 entity, with its own organist and     
 choir and manages on the whole to have
 two services each Sunday during this  
 period,  while the other three        
 churches (Shrawley, Little Witley and 
 Gt.Witley) have services in rotation  
 and share a choir and organist.       </content>
