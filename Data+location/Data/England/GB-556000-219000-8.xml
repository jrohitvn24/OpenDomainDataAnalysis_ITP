		<title>08A MOTORISTS' SERVICE AREA?</title>
		<content> Takeley has always been a stopping    
 place - its name may have come from   
 the Saxon 'Teg-ley' or 'sheep         
 clearing' - a place where sheep could 
 be rested for the night.  Today it    
 caters more for the motorist with four
 service garages, a restaurant designed
 for the travelling motorist, a motel  
 for overnight accommodation and the   
 public houses all provide snack meals.
 Even the Post Office sells hot pies to
 take away.  It is also interesting to 
 note that there are two crash repair  
 specialists and a large car breakers  
 yard.  The largest commercial         
 enterprise is motorist orientated as  
 it supplies and services caravans.    
 Nearly every household in Takeley owns
 a motor car and very many have more   
 than one.
