		<title>02COTTON FARM</title>
		<content> The owner of Cotton Farm has 120 acres
 of land,some of it is for grazing,some
 for silage,turnips or maize.The barns 
 are built of stone,slate and wood.1840
 was marked on a stone in the barn     
 where cows and chickens were kept. We 
 saw a litter of 18 piglets that were 3
 weeks old,usually 14 is a good size   
 litter.The farmer has 70 cows,the     
 milking parlour was built in 1980 and 
 the cows are milked here at 6a.m.and  
 5p.m.daily.Each winter a cow eats     
 50-60 tons of silage.All the local    
 farms are built near streams,the water
 is pumped to 2 large tanks,and each   
 cow drinks 20-30 gallons per day.Most 
 machinery belongs to the farmer,but he
 does hire and share some.He gets some 
 one to cut his hedges,he has one other
 worker on the farm.
