		<title>10Tilly Whim Caves</title>
		<content>      The sea cliffs in our study area 
 were quarried over 150 years ago for  
 Portland Limestone. Tilly Whim caves  
 are not natural caves, but old quarry 
 workings.                             
      A whim was a crane that was used 
 for lifting the stone from the quarry 
 down into barges which then           
 transported the stone to Swanage.     
 Tilly was the name of one of the      
 quarrymen.                            
      George Burt opened thw caves as a
 tourist attraction in 1887 and they   
 remained so until 1977 when after     
 safety inspection they were closed to 
 the public. They now provide a habitat
 for bats.                             
      From the cliff path you can look 
 down onto the ledges where the whim   
 was sighted and marvel at the skill of
 the quarrymen.
