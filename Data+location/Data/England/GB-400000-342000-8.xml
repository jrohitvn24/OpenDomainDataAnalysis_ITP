		<title>08Mum's Day (Mrs A.G.Campbell)</title>
		<content>I awoke this morning at 7 a.m.Peeping  
through the curtains I saw a soft haze 
over the Green in front of our house,a 
strong indication that at last we may  
be in for a long overdue summery,warm  
day.After slipping into my dressing    
gown I sleepily descend the stairs,    
fill the kettle &amp; reach out for the    
breakfast Cereals.Dad has long since   
left for work so the three of us have  
our Breakfast &amp; prepare to leave for   
School.We are picked up by Nan &amp; Grand-
-ad as it is Ascension Day &amp; they are  
going to Mass.We shall miss our usual  
walk via the much loved railway path.  
We say our goodbyes at the top of the  
School Drive &amp; go our separate ways,   
albeit we shall all be at Mass         
together.After Mass I go &amp; buy food in 
for the weekend from the local Super-  
-market,which is all hustle &amp; bustle.
