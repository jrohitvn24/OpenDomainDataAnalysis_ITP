		<title>16CHALK QUARRIES IN N.FAREHAM</title>
		<content> There is evidence that chalk and flint
 has been quarried in this area for    
 over 2000 years but the quarries in   
 N.Fareham are of much more recent     
 origin.The rock was used for roadstone
 to improve turnpike roads,or as a     
 ballast for more modern roads.There is
 evidence that chalk was used to       
 manufacture building materials such as
 mortar and flint which can be found as
 facing in the walls of some houses and
 boundaries.The modern use of the      
 quarries is as rubbish dumps,both     
 official and unofficial.The official  
 dumps are covered by a metre of clay  
 soil when full,then landscaped with   
 trees and shrubs.The unofficial       
 dumps,containing old beds and rusting 
 cars, have become both unsightly and  
 hazardous.
