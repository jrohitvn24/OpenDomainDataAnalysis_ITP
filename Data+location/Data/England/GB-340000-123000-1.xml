 This area lies in what is often       
 described as 'The Heart of            
 Somerset'. The land lies at only a    
 few feet above sea level and is       
 typical of the Somerset Levels. It is 
 drained by the River Parrett which    
 flows through the grid from South to  
 North, and an intricate network of    
 drainage ditches , locally called     
 rhynes. Houses are confined to the    
 higher ground where frequent winter   
 flooding can be avoided.  The villages
 of Drayton and Muchelney (The Great   
 Island) and the hamlets of            
 Midelney(Middle Island) and Muchelney 
 Ham,are the main centres of           
 population.The local building         
 materials are blue lias stone,pantiles
 and thatch.This is a rural area where 
 schools and shops have disappeared and
 only a post office remains.           </content>
