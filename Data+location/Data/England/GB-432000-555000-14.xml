		<title>14A SOUTH HYLTON FARM</title>
		<content> This farm shows clear signs of an     
 industrial history related to the     
 River Wear. In the centre of the      
 present day complex is a building with
 a chimney set at a different          
 orientation to the other structures   
 which relates directly to an old      
 railway incline down to the river. It 
 is an engine winding house and in     
 front of it is a sequence of cells for
 loading waggons, or for storage, below
 from the railway above. The incline   
 proceeds firstly as a cutting, then   
 under a masonry stone arch down to the
 Wearside quayside level. Alongside the
 railway is an old quarry site, grown  
 over with trees, and other structures 
 including a chimney. There is evidence
 of a tunnel. The farm buildings       
 include a square gin house, threshing 
 barn, stables and a blacksmith's.
