		<title>17The Lacon Childe School</title>
		<content> With 571 children, Lacon Childe isn't 
 very large. There are 34 teachers     
 teaching about 20 subjects. Mr. J.D.  
 Carr is headmaster. It is on two      
 sites, the old wing is 250 years old, 
 while the new wing is 30 years old.   
 There is a gymnasium, sports hall and 
 outdoor, heated swimming pool. There  
 are 12 governors, one representative  
 of parents, one of teachers and ten of
 local and county councils. Chairman is
 Mrs. M.J. Tomkinson. Year groups are  
 divided into 4, Wrekin, Stretton, Clee
 and Mortimer. In September, 1985,     
 there will be 72 new entrants, only 3 
 teaching groups. School uniform is    
 basically white or grey shirts, school
 tie, maroon sweater, grey skirt for   
 girls and black trousers for boys.    
 There is a P.T.A. which meets monthly 
 and helps organise fetes and other    
 fund raising activities.              </content>
