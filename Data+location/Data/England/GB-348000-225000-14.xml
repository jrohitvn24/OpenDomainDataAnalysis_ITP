		<title>14Fruit Farm  Marketing</title>
		<content>      Unlike many other farming        
 activities, fruit-growing does not    
 have guaranteed prices from the E.E.C.
 Intervention allows 2p/lb. which makes
 fruit picking uneconomic.  E.E.C.     
 regulations on fruit marketing quality
 are strictly controlled, into Fancy   
 Class, Group &amp; 2.  Other fruit can be 
 sold directly from the farm but not in
 wholesale markets.  Grades are on     
 colour, size and shape as well as     
 quality.  Sub-standard fruit in       
 markets is down-graded or returned.   
 Transportation of fruit to market     
 effects quality so this grower always 
 transports personally,starting the day
 at 3.0 a.m. at times.  Growers cannot 
 demand a set price, having to take    
 whstever the market offers.
