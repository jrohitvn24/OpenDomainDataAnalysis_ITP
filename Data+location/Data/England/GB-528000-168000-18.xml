		<content> Thornton Heath Pond was an oval pond  
 encircled by railings and trams passed
 along to London. In 1950 the tram     
 lines were removed. Now the pond no   
 longer exists. Smog frequently clouded
 this area reducing visibility, making 
 it impossible to see passing trams    
 from the pavement. The Crystal Palace 
 fire was visible as an orange glow and
 families found their window panes warm
 even at this distance from the        
 conflagration. Viewing flying boats   
 from the "Hercules Fleet" taking off  
 and landing at Croydon Airport        
 provided family Saturday outings.  So 
 too did the State and Pavilion        
 cinemas. A Bingo Hall now occupies the
 State site. An interesting shop in the
 High Street called The Hole in the    
 Wall had only a square opening, like a
 kiosk, through which purchases were   
 made.                                 </content>
