  Some of the people do their shopping 
 in Wye and the little shops around.   
 Most of the people who we asked live  
 in Wye and thinks that Wye is nice and
 peaceful to live in.Some people like  
 the little restaurants and eat very   
 often there.All the shops that we went
 to,the people who we interviewed were 
 all selfemployed.The porter from Wye  
 College enjoyed his work.Before he    
 worked in Wye College he had worked in
 the bakery over the road.We           
 interviewed a lady and she said she   
 was a Barmaid.We interviewed a man    
 from the Iron-mongers.
