		<title>09Memories of Britwell</title>
		<content> We learnt from interviewing Mr Cooper 
 that he moved to Britwell in 1928 and 
 he has lived there for fifty seven    
 years.  In the first World War he     
 fought on the somme and he can        
 remember seeing dead men and horses   
 around him. He was injured whilst     
 fighting the Austrians in Italy so he 
 was sent to hospital.  When he left   
 the hospital he remembered seeing     
 marble pillars and steps in the       
 entrance.  After the war he was head  
 Chauffeur to Major and Mrs Whitacker  
 at Britwell House. Whilst they were   
 visitng some relatives in Italy Major 
 Whittacker said they would stop for   
 lunch at the Hotel Merimar.  As they  
 pulled up at the hotel Mr Cooper      
 noticed it was the same building that 
 he stayed in when he was in hospital. 
 After lunch he showed the Whittakers  
 the room he had slept in.             </content>
