 The town is locally known as{'Bowzer'.
 It takes its name from{'over',}meaning
 a high place, and from{'Bel'}or       
{'Baal',}the name of a heathen God.    
 Bolsover therefore signifies{'Bel's   
{high place'.                          
                                       
  {BOLSOVER ILLUMINATIONS/FLOWER SHOW  
                                       
 There used to be a Flower Show in the 
 Castle Grounds and illuminations in   
 Sherwood Lodge, both annual events.   
 Alison's great uncle had a private bus
 which brought people from Langold in  
 Nottinghamshire to the show. As well  
 as the illuminations in Sherwood      
 Lodge, the castle was floodlit for the
 occasion.
