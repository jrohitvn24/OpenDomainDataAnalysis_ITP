		<title>20HOME LIFE-WINTHORPE</title>
		<content> We live in a detached{house}in        
 Winthorpe. We have nine rooms, our    
 lounge-dining room has a sofa, two    
 chairs, a table, an organ, a book     
 shelf, a record player, television,   
 video and cassette recorder.          
 We{cook}by gas and there is a central 
 heating radiator in each room,to clean
 we use a hoover, and an automatic     
 washing machine cleans our clothes.   
 We own two cars .                     
 A typical tea for us would be cheese, 
 bread, salad, fruit and cake.         
 In winter we eat more hot{food.}      
 On Sunday we might have a big lunch of
 roast beef, yorkshire puddings,       
 potatoes and vegetables.              
 Our garden is quite small. We grow    
 flowers, herbs, vegetables and fruit. 
 In my spare time I watch the          
 television, read,draw and sew.I also  
 play the  clarinet.                   </content>
