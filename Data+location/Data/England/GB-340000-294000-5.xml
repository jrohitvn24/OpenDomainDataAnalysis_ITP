 The{Common Pound}at{Ratlinghope,}     
 which was used for keeping stray      
 animals,{is opposite the Manor House.}
 The walls of the pound are part of the
 Manor Farm boundary and run along the 
 side of the road.                     
   The pound is made of stones joined  
 with mortar.It is shaped like a       
 capital letter "D" on its side with   
 the curved part nearest the road.     
   The back wall is 7.30m long and     
 2.00m high.It is in good condition.The
 curved wall has flat stones on top but
 it is falling down where it joins the 
 back wall and at the gate opening.It  
 is 9.91m long with a gate of 1.04m.The
 other wall,the flat bottom of the     
 "D",is 5.00m long but is crumbling    
 badly.                                </content>
