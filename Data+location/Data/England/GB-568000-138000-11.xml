		<content>Formed in l946 the Sports Club has a   
field and pavilion in Maidstone Road   
which is used by the Football and Table
Tennis Clubs in Winter and the Cricket 
Club in Summer.                        
The Tennis Club has two hard courts a  
little further along the road.         
The swings and slide of the Children's 
Playground were moved in l984 from the 
sports field to Lockets Green opposite 
the school in Back Lane. Once part of  
the school grounds, Lockets Green now  
holds the Scout hut and the Youth Club.
Situated on the North side of the      
Village Green the Working Men's Club   
opens every evening from 6 to ll p.m.  
and on Sundays from l2 to 2.30 p.m.    
It was given by the Austen Trustees in 
l9l9 as a war memorial.  The clock     
tower was built in l887 to celebrate   
the Jubilee of Queen Victoria.
