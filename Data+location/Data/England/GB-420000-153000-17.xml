		<title>17Everleigh's Pheasants</title>
		<content> The Pheasantry in Everleigh hatches a 
 quarter of a million pheasant chicks  
 per year. At 24hrs old the chicks are 
 dispatched to land owners to enable   
 their gamekeepers to rear them for the
 shoots.                               
 On a shoot there are approximately 10 
 beaters to 8 guns. Beaters use sticks 
 as quietly as possible otherwise the  
 birds crouch, or as Wiltshire men say 
 "Jug Down" and will not move.         
 Pheasants can only fly 100 yards at a 
 time in straight flight and should    
 only be shot flying away not on the   
 approach. There are 7-8 drives per    
 day, finishing one hour before sunset 
 to enable the wiley birds to fly to   
 roost. The beaters today receive a    
 bottle of beer and Â£10 as payment.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
