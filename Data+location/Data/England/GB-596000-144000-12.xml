		<title>12HOTHFIELD (2)</title>
		<content> The rest of the square not taken up by
 housing contains a part of{Hothfield  
{Common,}open farmland with the largest
 farm called Ripple Court which deals  
 mainly in sheep rearing.              
                                       
 The square is very well served by     
 roads.There is a popular stopping     
 place for goods vehicle drivers who   
 use the mobile cafe and toilets at the
 roadside on the A20 Trunk Road.       
                                       
 On week-days some seven buses a day   
 run through the area with three on a  
 Sunday. Road communications are       
 therefore quite good to Ashford or for
 further afield to Maidstone.          
                                       
 It is quite likely that the character 
 of the local road system will change  
 radically when the{M20 Motor-way}     
 opens.                                </content>
