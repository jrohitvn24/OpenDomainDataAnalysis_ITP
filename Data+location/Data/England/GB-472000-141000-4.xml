{Froyle Primary School was built by Sir
{Hubert Miller,}the Lord of the Manor, 
 in 1867, before education was         
 compulsory and it has had up to 150   
 children at times in the past.  In    
 recent years the population in the    
 village has dropped and the school now
 only has 25 pupils.{ The Hampshire    
{authority propose its closure in      
{1986} with the children transferring  
 to Bentley School nearby.{ The        
{building is beautiful,}of local       
 malm-stone (Froyle is on the edge of  
 chalk land and river gravels).  The   
 adjacent school house (no longer lived
 in by the school's head teacher) was  
 the last building in the village to be
 built with stone quarried locally.
