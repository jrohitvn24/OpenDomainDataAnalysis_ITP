		<title>14HIGHER BILLINGE LANE FARM</title>
		<content>  This is a dairy farm, it is worked by
 John Birchall, it has been in his     
 family for many years,but the Tatlock 
 herd was started by his father, it was
 named after a hillock on their land.  
  It was originally an arable farm but 
 after opencast mining had taken out   
 the minerals the land was only fit for
 grazing.                              
  The herd is of freisian heffers, they
 have no bulls, they rely on artificial
 insemination to produce stock to carry
 on the herd.                          
  At the moment there are about 80 head
 of cattle which have to be milked     
 twice daily, at 6.30 a.m. and 4.30p.m.
 The milk is stored in large cool tanks
 until the tanker calls to pick it up  
 at about 12 noon. The milk is then    
 taken to Unigate Dairies in Liverpool 
 for treatment and bottling, before    
 being sent out to the customers.      </content>
