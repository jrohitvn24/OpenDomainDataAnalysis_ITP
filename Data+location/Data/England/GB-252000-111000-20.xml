		<content>     The work carried out for this     
 project has included a survey of the  
 people of{Merton}.A questionnaire was 
 taken to half the homes in the parish 
 and the information collected has been
 used in making this response.Other    
 interesting facts discovered include  
 the following:---                     
     Two thirds of the adult residents 
 of{Merton}were born in Devon.         
     More than half the adult residents
 of{Merton}like the place primarily    
 because it is in the country.         
                                       
     This response has been compiled by
 the children of Class 1 at the{Clinton
{School,Merton }with the help of their 
 Headteacher.Assitance has been given  
 by many other adults in the local     
 community and we are grateful to them.
