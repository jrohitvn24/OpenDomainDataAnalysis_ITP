		<title>02Traffic in South Molton</title>
		<content>  South Molton is a market town. On    
 Thursday a lot of country people come 
 to market.When the farmers and        
 shoppers come in to town they park on 
 yellow lines because all the other    
 places are taken up and you can't     
 drive through the narrow streets      
 because of them.We did a traffic      
 survey on the main road on Thursday   
 morning and found that 265 cars, 33   
 lorries, 3 caravans, 6 trailers, 3    
 tractors, 31 vans, 1 motorbike and 14 
 landrovers.                           
  The lorries unloading their food and 
 goods have to park by the shops and   
 you can't get past and it causes      
 problems. In the summer the roads get 
 blocked by holiday makers passing     
 through.                              
  It would help if they built a        
 multi-storey car park and also they   
 are building a bypass road from       </content>
