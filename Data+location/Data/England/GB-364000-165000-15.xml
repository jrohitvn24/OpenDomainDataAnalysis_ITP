		<title>15A Walk To Chewton Keynsham</title>
		<content> On our walk to{Chewton Keynsham}we    
 went through a lane starting at St.   
 Clements Road.On either side were     
 Holstein-Fresian(black and white)cows 
 as well as crops such as barley and   
 grassland.There was lots of rubble on 
 the track and on the hill.All the     
 houses in Chewton were made of stone. 
 There were a few farms.One was unused 
 except for the farm-house.We saw Manor
 Farm House and Manor Farm Cottage.    
 Manor Farm House was a grand old place
 and Manor Farm Cottage was a small    
 house with lots of flowers in the     
 garden.We saw an old-fashioned post-  
 box built in a wall.We stopped at     
 Chewton Keynsham church.It had wrought
 -iron railings painted green.Then we  
 retraced our steps a bit and turned   
 right down a lane.Some of the lane was
 flooded because there had been lots of
 rain.We stopped at Chew bridge.       </content>
