		<title>04KETTLEWELL, THE CHURCH</title>
		<content>   The church is called St. Mary's,    
 first mentioned in the Domesday survey
 of the manor.                         
   A Norman church stood near the      
 village's old King's Head Inn, but    
 that was destroyed in the eighteenth  
 century by fire or flash flood.  A    
 Norman or Saxon font remains. The     
 tower is of ancient but unknown date. 
 The first named priest was Radulphus, 
 appointed by the Abbot of Coverham.  A
 list of rectors and vicars hangs in   
 the Church, and a framed document     
 concerning tithes. The Bishop of      
 Bradford is a patron.  This year a new
 hand-carved oak altar has been        
 dedicated, and a special three-day    
 flower festival and other events have 
 marked the re-opening 100 years ago of
 the rebuilt nave and chancel.  The    
 vicar is also vicar of Arncliffe with 
 charge of Hubberholme and Conistone.  </content>
