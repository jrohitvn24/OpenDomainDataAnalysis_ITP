		<title>06BBC Monitoring at Caversham</title>
		<content>     My father works for the BBC.He    
 monitors Russian Television.He works  
 from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.He used to work  
 night shifts _10 p.m to 7 a.m. He     
 watches television nearly all day,    
 first watching then monitoring the    
 television.                           
    On the 13th of March the television
 news programme 'South Today' did an   
 article on BBC Caversham.It was after 
 the Soviet Leader  had died .The      
 people monitoring Soviet Central      
 Television did not hear the programme 
 preview for the following day as usual
 so they guessed something was amiss _ 
 probably the death of Chernenko.The   
 next day  there were a lot of wildlife
 films and solemn music.Finally the    
 announcement was made that Chernenko  
 was dead.In that way BBC Caversham    
 knew of the death of Chernenko before 
 the Russian people.                   </content>
