		<title>04EDUCATION CLAUGHTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> CLAUGHTON IS SITUATED IN SOME OF THE  
 PRETTIEST COUNTRYSIDE IN LANCASHIRE.  
 OUR SCHOOL IS WELL OVER 100 YEARS OLD.
 RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN THREATENED WITH  
 CLOSURE BUT EVERYONE ROUND HERE IS    
 DOING THEIR BEST TO SEE THAT IT STAYS 
 OPEN.MOST OF US COME TO SCHOOL BY TAXI
 AND KNOW WE WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL MUCH 
 FURTHER IF THIS SCHOOL WERE CLOSED.THE
 SCHOOL IS USED FOR OUR ANNUAL         
 CHRISTMAS FAIR AND EVENTS LIKE FANCY  
 DRESS PARTIES FOR HALLOWEEN AND OTHER 
 SPECIAL OCCASIONS. WE FEEL THAT OUR   
 SCHOOL IS SO POPULAR THAT WE WANT IT  
 TO STAY OPEN FOR 200 YEARS.
