		<title>16HOLTON AREA TREES, HEDGES</title>
		<content> Trees and hedges in the area include  
 ALMOND, one of the first trees to     
 flower after Winter, the HORSECHESTNUT
 (schoolchildren gather the nuts in    
 Autumn to play conkers).YEW is mostly 
 found in Churchyards. HAWTHORN is fast
 growing and therefore used for        
 hedgerows. HOLLY with its red berries 
 in winter has long been the symbol of 
 Christmas. Many ELM trees have been   
 lost in recent years through Dutch Elm
 Disease. CYPRESS is very often used in
 gardens for hedges and LABURNUM is    
 also a very popoular garden tree but  
 its seeds are very poisonous.         
 Other trees found include Ash, Oak,   
 Silver Birch, Cherry, Sycamore,       
 Willow, Walnut, Crab Apple, Poplar,   
 Elder, Plum and Spruce.
