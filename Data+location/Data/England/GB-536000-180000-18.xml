of transport;buses,tubes,taxis,trains, 
coaches,the tube,mini-cabs,cars,trucks,
vans,lorries,motorbikes and bicycles.We
 an also include boats,barges and      
other small craft that travel on the   
canals which pass through our          
area.British Rail have 3 lines which   
pass through our area but we only have 
2 stations 1 being Stepney East.On the 
Underground we have 3 services;the     
Metropolitan,the Central and the       
District Lines.London Regional

services which pass through our        
area;5,10,10a,15,22a,25,25a,106,253,277
and the Docklands Clipper.There are    
also night services.All in all there   
is quite an extensive coverage but a   
close look at the transport maps will  
show areas which could be served       
better.                                </content>
