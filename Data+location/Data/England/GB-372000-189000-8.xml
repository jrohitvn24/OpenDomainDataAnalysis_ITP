		<content>  There are more new than old houses in
 the village of Kingswood. The new     
 houses seem to be smaller than the old
 ones, though some of them are small   
 terraced cottages. Most of the old    
 houses, which are three storeys high  
 are around the old Abbey Gateway in   
 the middle of the Village. There are  
 no thatched houses in Kingswood. All  
 the houses are made of brick or stone 
 and have tiled or slate roofs. There  
 are a few bungalows on the main road  
 out of Kingswood. Most of the houses  
 in the village are different from one 
 another, except on the two estates:   
 the council estate and a new private  
 estate. The newest housing estate was 
 started in 1980 and some of the houses
 are still being built. There are not  
 many houses in Kingswood which are not
 lived in.
