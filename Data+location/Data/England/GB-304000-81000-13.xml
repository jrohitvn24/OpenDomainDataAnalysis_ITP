		<title>13Village Life near Salterton</title>
		<content> We interviewed a mother who lives in  
 Knowle village near Budleigh Salterton
 She told us that the village park is  
 very good as it keeps the children    
 occupied when they have nothing better
 to do.The park contains a death slide,
 some swings,a see-saw and several     
 climbing frames.Nobody worries about  
 the noise made by the children.       
 The mother told us that the village is
 about 400 years old and that although 
 the village is a very busy one there  
 is a lot of wild life and the most    
 common animal is the fox.             
 The family of the mother we inter-    
 viewed have lived in Knowle village   
 for seventy years. There is a village 
 shop which sells almost anything a    
 garage and a popular public house nick
 named The Dog and Donkey.
