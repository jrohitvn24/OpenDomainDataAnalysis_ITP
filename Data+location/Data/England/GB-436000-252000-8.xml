 Unemployment is quite common in our   
 country at this time. Many people     
 work in different towns and villages  
 from the ones they live in.Both men   
 and women go out to work but jobs are 
 difficult to find.In Northend there   
 aren't many jobs.Most jobs are invol_ 
 ved with working on the land,so many  
 people in the village work in the     
 surrounding towns such as Leamington, 
 Warwick, Stratford and Banbury.       
   In a sample of 24 children we found 
 that 66% of their mothers worked.25%  
 of their fathers worked in the        
 villages of Northend,Gaydon or        
 Knightcote. 75% of their fathers      
 worked outside this area.
