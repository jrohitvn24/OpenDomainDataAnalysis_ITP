		<title>06Farming in Draycott</title>
		<content> There are almost 20 farms in the area,
 the majority are owned by the{Duchy of
{Lancaster,}but although tennanted some
 have been passed down from one        
 generation to the next.               
                                       
 The land which is mainly grassed is   
 used for dairy cattle and some beef   
 cattle, sheep and pigs. Goats are a   
 fairly popular animal for those with  
 smallholdings.                        
                                       
 Fields with less heavy soils which are
 suitable for ploughing are used mainly
 for varieties of grain or for silage. 
                                       
 Most of the fields are smaller than   
 average, giving an attractive         
 landscape and benefitting the wildlife
 without hindering the work of the     
 farmers.
