 The present owner of this farm took   
 over in the 1960s.He started off      
 building a herd of pedigree cattle,   
   but now he is an arable and sheep   
 farmer.The owner has contractors      
 to  do ploughing,sowing,havesting and 
 mechanical work on the land including 
 the cutting down of stag trees.       
            {LAND COVER                
 The farm covers an approximate area of
 150 acres.The 3 main buildings are,   
 the main house,the corn bin house.    
 which is now used for the ewes when   
 lambing.In the garden there is an     
 orchard and a swimming pool.          
          {GROUND CONDITION.           
 The land is a mixture of flat and     
 steep hilly ground.The last owner of  
 the farm used the land for sheep      
 grazing and therefore none of it was  
 ploughed.                             </content>
