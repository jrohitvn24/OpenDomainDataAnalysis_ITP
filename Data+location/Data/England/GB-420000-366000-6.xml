		<content>    Bakewell  attracts  many  visitors,
 mainly travelling  by  car.  However a
 large amount of traffic not only comes
 to Bakewell but goes through. This is,
 though, very different on Mondays when
 it's {Market day,} and also, of course
 on Bank Holidays.  We  went  into  the
 centre of Bakewell and  performed a 20
 minute traffic survey.  It showed that
 94  vehicles came  into  Bakewell from
 Matlock Street and 114  went out along
 Buxton Road.
