		<title>08BIRD LIFE IN SEAHAM</title>
		<content> THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF     
 BIRDS IN AND AROUND SEAHAM.SOME COME  
 TO OUR GARDENS AND WE SEE OTHERS IN   
 THE PARKS AND AT THE SEASIDE.I'VE EVEN
 SEEN A KESTREL ON MY TELEVISION       
 AERIAL.IT IS A BIRD OF PREY.THERE ARE 
 CROWS IN THE TREES IN THE PARK.AT     
 SCHOOL MY CLASS HAD A FEEDING STATION 
 IN THE GARDEN LAST WINTER.WE SAW      
 BLUETITS,GREATTITS,CHAFFINCHES ,      
 SPARROWS,THRUSHES,BLACKBIRDS,ROBINS   
 AND EVEN THE SEAGULLS AND PIGEONS CAME
 TO EAT.AT NIGHT WE SOMETIMES HEAR AN  
 OWL HOOTING.IN THE SUMMER THE HOUSE   
 MARTENS BUILD THEIR NESTS IN THE EAVES
 OF MY HOUSE.WE ENJOY OBSERVING AND    
 IDENTIFYING ALL THESE BIRDS.SOME      
 CHILDREN COLLECT BIRDS EGGS EVEN      
 THOUGH IT IS ILLEGAL.THERE ARE HEAVY  
 FINES FOR TAKING THE EGGS OF BIRDS OF 
 PREY OR THOSE OF RARE BIRDS.
