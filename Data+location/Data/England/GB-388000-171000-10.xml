 There are a number of football fields 
 in the area and many men play in both 
 the Chippenham and District football  
 leagues.One plays on Saturday and the 
 other on Sunday.The river Avon,which  
 runs  through Chippenham is ideal for 
 canoeing and there is an active canoe 
 club which is becoming popular        
 especially amongst teenagers.There are
 also tennis courts,karate and cricket 
 clubs,a bingo hall and a cinema.There 
 has been a revolution in the          
 manufacture of sports clothes.This is 
 now a fashion industry.New materials  
 have made it possible to wash and dry 
 sports clothing easily.Stretch        
 materials have made clothes better    
 fitting.This in turn has influenced   
 fashion generally.Most people are more
 casually dressed now.
