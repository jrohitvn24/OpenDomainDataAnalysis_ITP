		<title>05LAINDON SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The{Laindon shopping centre}is quite  
 convenient for most people. I know    
 because from my house it is only a ten
 minute walk and a five minute drive . 
 The only disadvantage is that on      
 Saturday the car parks get over full  
 and you have to park by the garages or
 up Worthing Road .                    
 Laindon has two chemists which are    
 quite good there is not usually a big 
 queue. There are about two super      
 markets (International is the biggest)
 and the other is Shoppers Paradise.   
 There has just been a new indoor      
 market opened. I bought a pound of    
 grapes at sixty one pence per pound   
 and only got charged fifty pence.
