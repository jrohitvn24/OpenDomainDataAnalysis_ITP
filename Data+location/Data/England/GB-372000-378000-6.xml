		<title>06THE ROYAL GEORGE, KNUTSFORD</title>
		<content>   The Royal George boasts a history   
 back to the 14th century although     
 certainly from 1653 it was called the 
 George and Dragon.  It was a lively   
 and important coaching inn.  As well  
 as accommodating country meetings,    
 tooth pulling took place here!        
   The Assembly Rooms, the setting for 
 many scenes in Mrs. Gaskell's Cranford
 and other books, has also been witness
 to real life drama.  Highwayman       
 Higgins set off from here to rob Lady 
 Warburton of the jewels he had seen   
 her wearing here, and much later      
 General Patton addressed his troops   
 from the balcony. The George and      
 Dragon became the Royal George in 1832
 after the visit by Queen Victoria and 
 her mother the Duchess of Kent. Other 
 visitors of interest include Louis    
 Napoleon 1847, the public executioner 
 1886 and Winston Churchill.           </content>
