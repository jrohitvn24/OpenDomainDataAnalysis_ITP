		<title>12KETTLEWELL PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   The school has just celebrated its  
 Centenary.  Built half a mile outside 
 the village by local subscription     
 after disagreements with the church,  
 it had a young headmaster who gave    
 many years of dedicated service, with 
 original ideas in an independent      
 tradition continued today.            
   24 pupils come to the school today, 
 a clearly visible limestone landmark  
 on the road to Starbotton.  They all  
 stay for dinner, which is cooked in   
 the kitchen -  6 infant boys, 8 junior
 girls and 10 junior boys.  12 come    
 from Kettlewell, the others by bus    
 from Starbotton, Buckden, Raisgill,   
 Oughtershaw and Greenfield.           
   It is staffed by one headteacher,   
 an infant teacher, a part-time        
 teacher, music teacher for 2 hours per
 week and a clerical non-teaching      
 assistant.                            </content>
