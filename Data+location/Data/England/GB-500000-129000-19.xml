		<title>19NELL BALL,POND AND GREEN.</title>
		<content>{,Nell Ball is a mound 88 metres high  
{on the edge of Plaistow. }It has a    
 trig-point reference number 56254.    
 The local legend is that{Nell Gwynn   
 dances round the tree at the top.  It 
 is also said that fishermen and       
 sailors near Littlehampton used the   
 tree as a guide.                      
                                       
{The Village Pond}has a spring and     
 never dries up. Steps lead down into  
 the pond, once used on washing days. A
 slope leads into the pond where cattle
 drank and where dirty carts were      
 washed.                               
                                       
{The Village Green}has a roundabout and
 swings given by{Lord Wilson}who lived 
 nearby. In May time children dance    
 round the{Maypole}and a lamb is cooked
 on a spit and fair games are held.
