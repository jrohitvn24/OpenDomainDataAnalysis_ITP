		<content>     The National Trust own the Common.
 Every summer 400 beasts are allowed on
 Minchinhampton and 240 on adjoining   
 Rodborough Common.Only Commoners can  
 graze beasts but only l7 out of 256   
 take up their rights.It costs Â£4 for a
 cow or horse and Â£2 for a goat.The    
 Vicar of Amberley grazes some goats.On
 Minchinhampton no bulls are allowed.  
     Beasts used to be branded but one 
 year a bucket of pitch was kicked over
 and badly burned a brander.Now they   
 use plastic tags with the colour      
 changing every year.People use the    
 Common for things like flying kites   
 and model aeroplanes, as well as      
 playing football and golf.Golf has    
 been played since l880 despite cows   
 walking across the greens.Animals seem
 to like Minchinhampton Common best but
 there are more wild flowers on        
 Rodborough as well as a caravan site. </content>
