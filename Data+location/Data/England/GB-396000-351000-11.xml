		<content>   The Caldon Canal is the main tourist
 attraction, now that it is navigable, 
 now accessible from Stoke-on-Trent and
 links up to the main canal network.   
 Its towpath provides pleasant walks   
 and the flint mill with its twin      
 wheels and working machinery is a     
 great attraction. The Cheddleton Steam
 Railway is growing as more rolling    
 stock is aquired, but it relies on    
 British Rail allowing it to use their 
 line for any special journeys. The    
 area is not renowned for its tourism, 
 as the village is not particularly    
 pretty and just off the main road road
 along which most tourists are         
 travelling to other better known      
 beauty spots.
