		<title>14Weymouth Town Bridge.</title>
		<content>  The present{Town Bridge}is the       
{seventh to be}built.The previous ones 
 were built in{1594,1713,1741,1770,1824
{and}1880.The foundation of the present
 bridge was laid in April 1929.While   
 the building was going on a temporary 
 bridge was built which allowed people 
 to cross from St.Nicholas Street.The  
{Duke of York}opened the{new Town      
{Bridge on 4th July 1930.              
  When the bridge is opened to let{tall
{ships}through it causes a lot of      
 inconvenience.Cars have to wait in a  
{long jam}all along{St.Thomas Street.  
 Sometimes the bridge is open for      
{repairs}and the only way that people  
 can cross is by a{man rowing people   
 back and forth across the harbour.The 
{Control Room}is on the{left side}up   
 from St.Thomas Street.When the bridge 
 is about to go up lights flash and a  
 siren goes. -Kirsty Hayward.          </content>
