		<title>06The Churchyard in Sulgrave</title>
		<content>The churchyard surrounds the church on 
all sides and is entered by an         
evergreen tree lined path on the north 
side and a lych-gate on the south.The  
grass is cut regularly and relatives of
the dead visit the graves bringing     
flowers with them.                     
A recent survey recorded 318           
gravestones many of them without a name
or date due to weathering.Many stones  
have been used to rebuild the perimeter
wall.Graves sometimes had head and foot
stones with details of the dead person 
recorded on them.Others were chest     
tombs,slabs,crosses or just left as    
mounds.The materials used were local   
Hornton stone,Granite,Sandstone,Forest 
of Dean stone,Black and White marble.It
is now only possible to use Black      
marble with special permission from the
Bishop of Peterborough because of its  
unnatural appearance.                  </content>
