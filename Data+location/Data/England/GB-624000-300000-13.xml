 junior school and a high school.The   
 junior school has 220 pupils of ages  
 4-12.The uniform colours are blue,    
 grey,black and white.It is not a      
 strict uniform.It is a close-knit     
 community and is valued highly by the 
 neighbourhood.Framingham Earl high    
 School has 700 pupils of ages 6-12    
 drawn from the area around.The uniform
 is strict,the colours are dark and    
 light,blue and grey.The pupils like   
 the school.Their favourite subject is

 education the pupils are moved to a   
 school or college elsewhere,usually in
