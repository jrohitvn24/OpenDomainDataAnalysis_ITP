		<content>    Before{Carnforth Parish Church}was 
 built services were held in the small 
 C.of E. School on Haws Hill. The      
 population increased greatly when the 
 Ironworks were built (1864) and public
 meetings were held to raise money.In  
 1870 a Lancaster Rd. site was bought  
 and building started. The initial     
 building was small and was consecrated
 on 14-8-1873. By 1890 the population  
 had trebled. The church was again     
 too small. A North aisle 20'x 60' was 
 built, the west wall was moved further
 west, and a new vicarage was built on 
 North Rd. By 1909 the chancel and     
 vestry had been enlarged, a new roof  
 put on, a transept built for the organ
 and a tower and peal of bells added.  
 There have been no further structural 
 additions since, but a new vicarage   
 has been built on North Rd. opposite  
 the new{Christ Church School.         </content>
