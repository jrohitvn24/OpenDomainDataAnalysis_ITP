 The Finedon Church Sunday School      
Entertainment Society was formed in    
1898 and the first pantomime performed 
in 1937 was Aladdin.  A pantomime is   
now performed annually in the Star     
Hall where all productions have been   
staged.Finedon has a wealth of comic   
talent much appreciated by local       
audiences.                             
                                       
{The Butterfly.}                       
                                       
 It is usual for a hibernating         
butterfly to appear during the run of  
the show.If it appears the show is     
usually a success.One year someone     
trod on the butterfly and one of the   
principals fell down some steps and    
broke her ankle.She finished the week  
on crutches.                           
                                       </content>
