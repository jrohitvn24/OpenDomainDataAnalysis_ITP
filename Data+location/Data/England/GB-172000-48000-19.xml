		<title>19Economic life of St. Agnes</title>
		<content> St. Agnes has two banks, Barclays and 
 Lloyds, both being sub-branches of    
 their main banks in Perranporth.      
 No Building Society has its own       
 premises, but two operate locally -   
 Bristol &amp; West is combined with the   
 estate agents Miller &amp; Co., and Abbey 
 National is combined with the local   
 solicitors.  All are in Vicarage Road.
 The rates, controlled by the Carrick  
 District Council, increase each year. 
 The price of property has escalated in
 recent years due to the attractive    
 area and the nearness to the sea.  It 
 is now one of the most expensive areas
 in the county for buying property.    
 The two estate agents in the main     
 street carry a wide selection of      
 property, ranging from the traditional
 country cottage to the more spacious  
 and well-equipped modern bungalows and
 houses.                               </content>
