There are 110 pools and ponds in the D 
block which we are doing for our       
survey.Two of the ponds are called the 
Rookery because there are lots of      
trees around the ponds.The trees have  
got rooks nests in them.    The ponds  
are man made.They are there because    
the farmers used to get Marl out of    
the earth and put it on thei fields to 
make the wheat grow.    These holes    
were called MARL PITS. They have now   
filled with water and have turned into 
attractive pools with trees and bushes 
around them.     Some of the ponds     
have been stocked with fish and have   
become private fishing waters.
