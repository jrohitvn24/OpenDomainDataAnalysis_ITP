		<content> These are two of my favourite {       
{playground games}for {boys. T.V.games 
 is a good game. You have to say what  
 time the programme is on and then its 
 initials_say it was Crystal Tips and  
 Alistair it would be C.A._and then    
 tell them what channel it is on. If   
 they know it they run up to the caller
 then back again and if they get it    
 right they are it.{Sugar Mouse }is    
 another of my favourites. You have to 
 say a word like "cars" and everyone   
 picks a make. They tell the one who is
 it and he shouts one out. The ones who
 chose the make run up and down and    
 when they get back say "Sugar Mouse"  
 and the first one to say it is the    
 caller next time.
