		<content> The sand and gravel pits are located  
 in Bubbenhall.Consolidated Gold       
 operate the land which is owned by    
 John Charllote.He is paid royalties   
 for letting them use his land;for     
 every tonne that is sold he receives  
 so much money.The sand and gravel     
 extracted is used for cement and      
 concrete.The company started on this  
 site in 1980.When all of the sand and 
 gravel have been removed,Warwickshire 
 County Council fill in the holes with 
 rubbish from Leamington Spa and Rugby.
 This is known as "Landfill".It will   
 then be covered over with the top soil
 so that it can be used for farming    
 once again.Excavtions have revealed   
 fossils of Mammoth teeth dating from  
 the Pleistocene era.These sand and    
 gravel workings form a chain across   
 central Warks and were the outwash of 
 the Glacial period.                   </content>
