		<content>Amenities can be said to be limited for
villagers as basic day to day needs are
outside the village.A small village    
school for primary age group operates  
just outside our area as does the      
Village church.A Post Office cum gro-  
cers shop in village centre supplies   
many basic goods but the local inn     
"The Rising Sun" probably provides most
services for visitors to the village.  
The leisure centres &amp; Country Club     
point to a change of times for Fawkham,
originally a hop producing valley, now 
offering facilities for leisure instead
Horse riding stables,a private football
club-The Corinthian Club for Boys run  
by local farmer &amp; millionaire Mr.R.    
Billings,boarding kennels,private      
clinics,a naturist club,a rodeo club &amp; 
camping sites now form the main
