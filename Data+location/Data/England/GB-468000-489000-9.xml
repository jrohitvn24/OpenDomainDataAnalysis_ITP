		<content> Hunting,shooting and fishing all take 
 place in their seasons.The fishing is 
 private. Trout mainly are caught.The  
 Lord of Spaunton Manor has the moor-  
 land shooting rights,where grouse are 
 shot. He also rears and shoots        
 pheasants in woods bordering the moor.
 The shooting rights of the rest of the
 area belong mainly to another big land
 -owner.Local people also enjoy shoot- 
 ing rabbits,hares and clay-pigeons.The
 Sinnington Hunt includes this area and
 they hold their annual Hunt Ball in   
 Hutton Village Hall. Hutton has a very
 good bowling green and matches are    
 played against other local village    
 teams.There is a tennis court,recently
 completely repaired with money raised 
 by the tennis club. Gillamoor  has  a 
 football team (with Farndale)  and a  
 cricket team. Each village also has a 
 darts team playing at their local pubs</content>
