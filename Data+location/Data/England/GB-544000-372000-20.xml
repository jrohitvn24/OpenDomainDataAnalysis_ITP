		<title>20World War 2 - Willoughby</title>
		<content> One of the few evident remains of the 
 Second World War is in the paddock to 
 the north of Willoughby parish church 
 in the form of a concrete pill-box.   
 Its position controls one of the roads
 that run inland to Willoughby from the
 coast. It was built as an anti-       
 invasion measure early in the war.
