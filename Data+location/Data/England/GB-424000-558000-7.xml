		<title>07THE EFFECT OF WATER</title>
		<content>    The River{Wear}flowed through the  
 Team Valley until the Ice Age glacial 
 deposits diverted it to Sunderland.The
 River{Team}now flows there and is     
 joined by streams from the ravines    
{(Denes)}of Gateshead. The growth of   
 Gateshead caused these streams to be  
 channelled into sewers or culverts.   
 The roads which pass the Denes are    
 prone to flooding and in 1965 the{Chow
{Dene}flooded the newly opened         
 Breckenbeds School.The River Team     
 meandered through the valley until    
 1936 when the buildings of the        
{"Trading Estate"}canalised the river  
 and drained the swamps. Even in 1985  
 storm drains are being dug  on the    
 Team Valley to remove Gateshead's     
 excess water.
