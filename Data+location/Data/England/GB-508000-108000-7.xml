		<content> The farms and houses are mostly built 
 in local flint with some cottages in  
 brick.   Current use of flint is      
 evidenced by the work of the owner of 
 North Lodge, Muntham, who is not only 
 renovating an old Tudor cottage, but  
 also built an extension in Chinese    
 style (PHOTO 2).  The next project is 
 to enlarge the flint barn now used as 
 a pottery.                            
 The buildings used as housing and a   
 cattery were originally huntsmen's    
 kennels and are built of flint and    
 brick.
