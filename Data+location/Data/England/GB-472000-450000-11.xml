		<title>11WILBERFOSS TREE SURVEY.</title>
		<content>    A survey was conducted in Spring   
 1985.  It concerned only wild or      
 natural trees within the village      
 boundary.  The results recorded as    
 percentages were as follows:-         
{Holly }3.4% {Poplar }4.8% {Ash }11.7% 
{Black poplar }0.6% {Sycamore }17.9%   
{Goat willow }4.8% {Spindle }1.3%      
{Chestnut }11.7% {Beech }2.7%          
{Hawthorn }2.0% {Oak }13.1% {Willow    
  9.6% {Elm }2.7% {Alder }1.3%         
{Silver birch }12.4%.                  
    {Sycamore}was found to be the      
 most common species of tree in the    
 village. There is much interest in    
 saving as many trees as possible      
 and a tree planting programme is      
 beginning in 1985. Some of the most   
 attractive trees in the village will  
 be lost when the beck is widened to   
 prevent winter flooding.
