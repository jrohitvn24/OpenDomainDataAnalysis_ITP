		<title>03CLIMATE OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> With altitude of the land varying     
 between 500' and 1800' there is       
 obviously quite a varied climate.     
    The valley sides are steep and in  
 winter, little sun can get onto the   
 floor. Temperature ranges between -20C
 to + 28C. In well sheltered areas it  
 can become very warm on fine summer   
 days. Winters are varied ranging      
 between mild, wet spells and arctic-  
 like blizzards.                       
    The hill tops have a much more     
 severe climate with more wind and     
 rain (35"+). Snow can lie in gullies  
 from December to April with a general 
 snow cover over 1500' for more than 40
 days in the winter.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
