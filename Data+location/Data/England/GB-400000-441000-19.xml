		<title>19WEST LANE,SUTTON</title>
		<content>   West Lane leads from High St.up onto
 Sutton and Cowling Moors.At the bottom
 of the lane are two cottages dated    
 1638,with drip stones above mullioned 
 windows.To the left is the entrance to
 Sutton Hall,built in 1894 by a local  
 mill-owner J.W.Hartley,for Â£40,000 in 
 the Victorian-Gothic style.It was     
 demolished in the 1940's.             
 Further up West Lane is the site of   
 the Pinfold. This was a circular stone
 structure, 6ft high and 10yds in      
 diameter.The Pinder in the late 19th  
 century was Peter Petty,who while     
 rounding up stray animals was also the
 local mole catcher.The Pinfold was    
 demolished in 1896.                   
   Beyond the Pinfold is Stubbing Hill,
 meaning "clearing on the hill".21     
 people lived on the farm in 1851 but  
 fire destroyed it in 1886.
