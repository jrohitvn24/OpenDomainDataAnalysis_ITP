		<title>10A typical Saturday.</title>
		<content>   On a Saturday I get up at 8.30am,   
 one hour later than usual. I have my  
 breakfast and then I decide where to  
 go shopping. My family and I sometimes
 travel quite a way to go shopping and 
 in summer we go to the seaside instead
 of shopping.                          
   We usually start our shopping by    
 looking round the shops. My favourite 
 is the bicycle shop. I like to look at
 the racing bikes.                     
   We then look around the big stores  
 like{Marks and Spencers}and{Woolworths
 and my mum buys some groceries.       
   If my father can afford to we go for
 a meal in a restaurant.               
   In the afternoon we visit my grandad
 because he lives on his own. We watch 
 television at night and then go to    
 bed.                                  
                                       
                                       </content>
