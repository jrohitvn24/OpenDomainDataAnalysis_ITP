  On Friday I went to Chalkwell Bowling
 Green and met the Secretary.The club  
 has been there since 1901.It is open  
 all day in the summer.It is an open   
 air club.zit is used for fun and some 
 tournaments.There are 36 men and 40   
 women members.The grass is thick, very
 green and in good condition.This means
 you can only play in summer.          
  {Windsurfing }                       
 Southend is ideal for windsurfing with
 its gently sloping seafront and warm  
 climate. Every August nearly 200      
 competitors enter the windsurfing     
 championships. You can hire winsurfing
 equipment and be taught. Information  
 is available from the Tourist Office.
