		<title>15The Local Government</title>
		<content> As with many of the things which make 
 up the life in this area,the local    
 government and the services it        
 provides are split 3 ways.Flawborough 
 and Thoroton are in the Rushcliffe    
 area and the services are administered
 at West Bridgford.Alverton and Shelton
 are in the Newark area but are allied 
 to different local councils.The whole 
 area is on the conservative side of   
 politics and for many years all       
 representatives have been elected from
 this party.This is because most people
 in the area are middle class,property 
 owning and practically all fully      
 employed.This gives them a politically
 satisfied attitude towards the ruling 
 party of the moment because the area  
 has no industrial areas with there    
 noise,pollution and high unemployment.
