 My typical Monday begins at about     
 7.3O.  I get up, woken by the alarm,  
 get dressed and have my breakfast,    
 usually Rice Krispies.  My mum is     
 always downstairs making my packed    
 lunch, or taking my dog Jemma for a   
 walk.  I set off for school about     
 8.3O.  I walk down Fife Street, down  
 Exchange Street, cut across the field 
 along Farfield Street and down Haworth
 Street.  I get to the North Block of  
 Rhyddings High School at about 8.55.  
 I read through registration then go to
 my next lesson.  The bell for break   
 goes at lO.3O.  Usually I mess around 
 in the yard during break.   After my  
 next double lesson dinnertime bell    
 goes.  I go to my grandma's and get   
 there about l2.lO.  I have my dinner, 
 feed the stray cats my grandma keeps. 
 There are 3 kittens and 4 fully grown </content>
