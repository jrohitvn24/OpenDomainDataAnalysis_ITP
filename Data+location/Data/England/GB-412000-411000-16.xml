		<title>16HOLME VALLEY HOUSING (1)</title>
		<content>    In the small area of the Holme     
 Valley, covered by our 'D block',     
 there are examples of a wide variety  
 of domestic buildings.                
    In Honley's conservation area, and 
 in the surrounding countryside, are   
 houses and farms dating to the 17th C.
 These are built in local grit stone   
 with stone flagged rooves.            
    In the 18th and 19th C. stone built
 homes were provided in the valley     
 bottom for the workers of the textile 
 mills. Terraces of these small homes  
 remain. From the same period are the  
 larger detached homes of the middle   
 class, including the mill owners.     
 After the arrival of the railways, in 
 the 1850s, slate became the usual     
 roofing material.
