		<title>13RECREATION - COMPUTERS</title>
		<content> In our survey of 90 people questioned 
 in Harbury, we found that 64% had a   
 home computer.  Of these 30% owned the
 Sinclair Spectrum due to its          
 competitive price, the plentiful      
 software available and its            
 reliability.  The second choice was   
 the BBC micro with 20% of the market. 
 It, like the Spectrum, also has a lot 
 of games, the main supply coming from 
 Acornsoft.  The 3rd most popular is   
 the Electron, the BBC's smaller       
 "brother".  Nobody owned a computer 4 
 years ago in Harbury.  52% said that  
 they had had their computer less than 
 one year.  90% of people preferred    
 games rather than educational         
 programmes.  The most popular games   
 were Chuckie Egg, Elite, Hopper,      
 Ghostbusters and Pacman.  Chuckie     
 Egg was the favourite because it was  
 available for lots of computers.      </content>
