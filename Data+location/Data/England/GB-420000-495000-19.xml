		<content> Low Green is the hub of the village.  
 The beck is a great attraction to     
 children who paddle and fish there.   
 There are stepping stones leading     
 across the beck, ideal for childhood  
 games. The large green has had several
 smaller ones severed from it and one  
 of these has become known as the      
 Memorial Green as a stone cross stands
 there in memory of those who gave     
 their lives in the world wars. The    
 large green is constantly in use.     
 Children use it as a football and     
 cricket pitch, twice a year a         
 travelling showman errects swings and 
 roundabouts, but the main event of the
 year is the St Anne's Church fete when
 every organization in the village     
 participates. The highlight of the day
 is the maypole dance performed by the 
 village school children.
