      The correct name for the cub pack
 in the village is 24th Bedfordshire,  
 Riseley.  We belong to the Ouse Valley
 District in the county of Bedfordshire
 a district with only 5 cub packs, 4   
 scout troops and one beaver colony.   
 Riseley cubs meet on Tuesday evenings 
 at Margaret Beaufort School from 6.30 
 p.m. till 8.00 p.m.  The uniform is   
 the same as for all cubs, the only    
 difference being the colour of the    
 scarf which is all red for both the   
 cubs and scouts of the village.  We   
 start the meeting with 'Grand Howl'   
 and 'Flag Break' then inspection.  We 
 usually have a game or two followed by
 any work the cubs have been asked to  
 do for various badges.  At the present
 time we have only l4 cubs.  It has    
 been as high as 30 boys with a waiting
 list.                                 </content>
