		<content>    The old part of Wroughton is called
 the Pitchens.Most of the houses are   
 pre-war and have thatched roofs.There 
 are a lot of trees surrounding the    
 houses.It is a very small and quiet   
 place.There is a small stream which   
 runs along the side of the path to the
 reservoir.There is an old fasioned    
 turnstyle near the stream and people  
 go there for afternoon walks to the   
 waterfall.                            
   Bakers Road is also very old has and
 has a row of old houses called Bakers 
 Row.The whole area is at the foot of  
 the scarp slope which is the original 
 site of the village and still retains 
 much of it's old character.
