		<content>      On Friday{classes four and six   
 went for a walk in the country. We    
 went about 10 O'Clock. We all took a  
 pack lunch,I brought an apple,polos   
 some sandwiches and a nice drink and  
 two more things-two packets of crisps.
 We went over lots of{stiles,}at first 
 it was difficult to get over with our 
 bags but we got over in the end. We   
 went through some{fields of sheep}and 
 there were lots of droppings there so 
 we had to watch where we were going.  
 Some of us saw a{dead mole}and a{field
{mouse}and I saw a{rabbit.}We had to   
 find some little yellow squares of    
 paper but I never found one. We went  
 by{barns}and{woods}and lots of other  
 things. We walked about{6 kms.}and    
 my legs were aching. After about 5    
 hours time we were at school and we   
 all went home for a rest.
