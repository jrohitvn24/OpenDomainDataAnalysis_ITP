		<content>   There are a wide variety of social  
 and recreational clubs in Tockwith,   
 catering for all age groups.          
   The tennis club is held on the      
 Sports Field Trust Grounds. Yearly    
 there is a meeting when the committee,
 which is responsible for club rules   
 and the maintenance of the tennis     
 court, is elected. In 1985 there were 
 80 members. It is Â£2.50 for children  
 up to 16, Â£5.00 for adults and Â£12.50 
 for family memberships. Children under
 14 have to be supervised and can play 
 until 7.30pm. It is not necessary to  
 book a court, but a half hour courtesy
 has to be obeyed. Regulation clothes  
 of white T-shirt and shorts or skirt, 
 and smooth soled tennis shoes must be 
 worn. Members who do not obey the     
 rules can be suspended.
