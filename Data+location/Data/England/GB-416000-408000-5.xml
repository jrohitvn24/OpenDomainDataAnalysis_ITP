		<content> The Sovereign Inn is over 150 years   
 old and originally the building was   
 the local brewery. There are three    
 public rooms downstairs, a kitchen,   
 six private rooms upstairs and        
 cellars. The public house serves      
 mainly the villages of Shepley,       
 Cumberworth and Birds Edge as well as 
 providing refreshment for the casual  
 car trade. Six draught beers are      
 stocked as well as two bitters, a     
 mild,lager, stout,deaught cider,      
 bottled beer and soft drinks. Family  
 dining is very important. On an       
 average Sunday lunchtime, fifty       
 lunches and eighty bar meals are      
 served. Children are allowed in if    
 they are eating either at lunchtimes  
 or up to 9.00 pm in the evening. The  
 present landlord, Mr. Crowther sees an
 increasing need for catering for      
 families in the future.               </content>
