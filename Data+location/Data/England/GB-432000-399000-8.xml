		<title>08Kirk Balk School,Hoyland.</title>
		<content> I live in a council flat on the       
 Cloughs Estate in Hoyland.During the  
 week,except during holidays,I go to   
 Kirk Balk Secondary School.           
                                       
                                       
 School starts at 8.50 a.m. and        
 finishes at 3.40 p.m.The day begins   
 with a form period which lasts 20     
 minutes.Then we go to our lessons.My  
 favourite lesson is English because we
 do plays and study novels,which I     
 enjoy.                                
                                       
 The school serves dinners which       
 everybody moans about but which are   
 really good value at 50p each for     
 meat,three vegetables,and a pudding.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
