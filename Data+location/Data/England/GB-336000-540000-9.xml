		<title>09A rural Church in Cumbria</title>
		<content> St Mary's Church, Sebergham, is 800   
 years old.   There are 66 names on the
 electoral role and congregations vary 
 between 10 and 100 at the Harvest     
 Festival.   The Vicar is shared with  
 the adjoining parishes of Caldbeck and
 Castle Sowerby; he conducts only one  
 Service each month.   Another Service 
 is held by the parishoners themselves 
 if no Lay Reader is available.        
                                       
 Money is raised by collections and by 
 covenants given by the parishoners  on
 which the Church, being a charity, can
 reclaim tax.   Special fund raising   
 events include dances, domino drives  
 and sales of work.                    
                                       
 Money is spent on maintaining and     
 heating the church  and on the annual 
 diocesan quota.
