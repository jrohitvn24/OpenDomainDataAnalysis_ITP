		<title>18A Day in the Life of A.Blair</title>
		<content>  The evening papers arrive off the    
{16.30}bus _ another rush of customers 
 into the shop _ some wanting papers _ 
 others are children off the Hexham and
 Haydon Bridge School buses.Among them 
 is my daughter Tessa.                 
  It is{17.45}Time to shut and go      
 upstairs to rest.No such luck.My shop 
 has been so busy all week what with   
 the good sunny weather and all the    
 holidaymakers that we are running     
 short of sweets,pop,crisps etc...We   
 decide to go to a Cash and Carry      
 Supermarket at Newcastle.No time for  
 dinner.Sandwiches are prepared and off
 we go.A quick run through the Cash and
 Carry with a trolley,back into the car
 and off home.In Hexham we are feeling 
 hungry,so we stop in the Market Place 
 to go the Chinese take_away.We buy two
 helpings of Beef Chow Mein,then we    
 head for home once again.             </content>
