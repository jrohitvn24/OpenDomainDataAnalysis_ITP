		<title>10Merdon Manor (1)</title>
		<content>  The manor of Merdon is very old , the
 kings of the West Saxons having       
 manorial rights as long ago as 500AD .
 For three hundred years , between the 
 seventeenth century and 1940 , the    
 seat of the manor lay at Hursley Park 
 just south of the study area . The    
 main features of the area today have  
 been shaped by the long history of    
 this manor .                          
  For over nine hundred years the      
 control of the manor lay with the     
 bishops of Winchester , always among  
 the most powerful men in the country .
 In Tudor times it passed to the Holey 
 family . A hundred years later ,      
 Oliver Cromwell's son Richard aquired 
 the manor and it was his while he was 
 Protector , and remains Cromwellian   
 for a long period . Later the Cooper  
 family took over Hursley Park , but   
 now Merdon Manor is owned by Mr.Smith.</content>
