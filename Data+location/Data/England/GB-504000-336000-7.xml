		<title>07NEWTONS POPULATION LOSSES.</title>
		<content> Newtonhas been an estate village for  
 hundreds of years.In 1965 all its     
 properties were put in trust for sale 
 and the loss of population accelerated
 at this point as houses which became  
 empty were not relet nor were they at 
 once put up for sale.Only 8 houses    
 have so far been sold and 5 others    
 still stand empty.5 houses are still  
 occupied by estate tenants.The slow   
 sale of the properties may be the     
 result of the estate trying to        
 minimise the effect of Capital Gains  
 Tax on the estate as a whole.
