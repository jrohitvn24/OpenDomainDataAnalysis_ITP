		<title>03MUSLIMS AND THEIR RELIGION</title>
		<content> I am a Muslim and my Religion is      
 Islam;Islam means Obedience and       
 Woeship of Allah(God).Igo to the      
 Mosque,where children come to read the
 Holy Book,The Quran,and men come to   
 pray fife times a day,or they pray at 
 home or at work.Women and children    
 pray at home.Chidren are taught to    
 pray at about the age of 10 or 11,they
 start reading the Quran at about 7 or 
 8.The Quran was received by our last  
 Prophet,His name was Muhammed(Peace be
 upen Him).He was the last Prophet to  
 teach Muslims the right way of        
 following Allah(God).The Prophet used 
 to lead the prayers fife times a day  
 in Mecca,where the Ka Ba stands.      
 The Ka Ba is the Mosque which we face 
 when we pray.A Muslim,at least once   
 in his life,must go on a pilgrimage   
 to Mecca.                             
                                       </content>
