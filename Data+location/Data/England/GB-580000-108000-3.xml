		<title>03TOURISM IN HASTINGS</title>
		<content>  The climate has over 1800 sunshine   
 hours per year and less than 750mm of 
 rain. This and the abundance of Local 
 History sites, the beauty of the      
 landscape and good communications with
 London and the continent has led to   
 the growth of tourism.                
  Over a million people visit the town 
 each year, but most stay for a few    
 days. The number of hotels has        
 decreased but many stay in camping    
 sites near the town and come into the 
 town for entertainment.               
  Since the 1970's many foreign        
 students come to Hastings to learn    
 English. They stay with families to   
 experience British home life. About   
 25,000 come each year. They come      
 mainly from France, Germany, Sweeden, 
 Italy and Spain.
