		<content> The sole place of worship in the area 
 is the Parish Church at Rhydycroesau. 
 It once boasted its own parson, but   
 since 1947 services have been presided
 over by the rector of the nearby      
 village of Selattyn. Strangely the    
 church is located to the west of the  
 stream at Rhydycroesau, and is thus in
 Wales. However early in the twentieth 
 century its parishioners were allowed 
 to choose the destiny of their church,
 and opted to be part of the{Church of 
{England.}Our visit to the Sunday      
 communion service in June - there were
 six of us - found a congregation of   
 only six others! The Selattyn rector  
 said that this attendance was poor by 
 normal standards, usually between 12  
 and 20 being present. A small         
{Methodist}chapel operates nearby at   
 Cefn Canol, and{Roman Catholics}attend
 church in Oswestry.                   </content>
