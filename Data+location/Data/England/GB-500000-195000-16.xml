		<title>16Metro-Land in Chorleywood</title>
		<content>Once the grand dream of linking        
Manchester with Paris via London and a 
Channel Tunnel had died the            
Metropolitan Railway looked at the idea
of buying up land bordering their      
railway and building residential       
properties developing quiet country    
suberbs. This they sold as their idea  
of Metro-Land and much of Chorleywoods 
growth in the 1930's, and subsequent   
popularity is linked to the            
Metropolitan Railway. The earliest     
cottages built by the Railway Company  
were in Colley Land in the 1890's for  
their labourers. However their main    
Metro-Land development took place in   
the 1930's with the building of a large
number of houses.                      
The station is just as important today 
as the majority of working men in      
Chorleywood commute to work. (Of 80    
children only 3 dads worked locally).  </content>
