		<content> The Belvoir Joinery has been in       
 existence for the last 12 years.For   
 the last 2 years the Joinery has been 
 in the old Village Reading Room next  
 to the Village Hall.This was changed  
 into a workshop with a new roof and   
 new extension on the back of the      
 building which cost Â£5,000.The company
 put in new equipment,a cutter,a hole  
 puncher and slicer, which cost Â£3,000.
 They make tables, wardrobes,kitchen   
 units,new stairs,shelves,doors,window 
 frames and chairs.To make these they  
 use redwood,pine,oak and hardboard    
 which they buy from woodyards in      
 Nottingham and Grantham.Last year they
 made some furniture for the "play     
 corner" in our Infant classroom.The   
 Melton Times photographer came and    
 took photographs of the handing over  
 of the furniture.
