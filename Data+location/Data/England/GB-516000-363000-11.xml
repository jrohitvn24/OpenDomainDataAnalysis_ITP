		<title>11TRANSPORT-WOODHALL SPA</title>
		<content> Woodhall Spa is not very well served  
 by public transport.If you do not have
 a car or a motor cycle it is very     
 difficult to travel any distance      
 because buses are not very frequent   
 and there is no rail service today    
 although the village used to be well  
 served by trains.In the days when the 
 spa had many visitors there was ample 
 public transport.                     
 Houses in Woodhall Spa are very       
 expensive.The average price in the    
 village is almost twice the average   
 price for Lincolnshire.Because of     
 these factors most of the people who  
 buy the houses are fairly well off and
 own cars,which means that buses and   
 trains are becoming less necessary and
 declining further.
