		<content>  Crowhurst, a small rural parish, is  
 first mentioned in 1189 as "Crauherst"
 meaning "crow wood".                  
  The{Church of St. George}dates from  
 the 13th Century. In the wall of the  
 porch is a stoup which fell into      
 dis-use after the{Reformation.}The    
 font is thought to be Saxon. The basin
 is a hollowed stone lined with metal. 
 In the chancel are two tombs with     
 interesting brasses, and a tomb which 
 was prepared but never used. There is 
 also an unusual iron tomb set in the  
 floor which is a reminder of the{Iron 
{Industry }of S.E. Surrey.             
  An enormous hollow{Yew tree}stands in
 the churchyard.19th Century drawings  
 show a doorway, a table and seats for 
 twelve people inside. A cannonball    
 found here suggests a skirmish between
 Cromwell's men and the Royalist Angell
 family who lived opposite the Church. </content>
