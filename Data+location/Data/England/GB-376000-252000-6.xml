      The changing pattern of agricul_ 
 ture and employment has brought in its
 wake changes in housing.  Many of the 
 old farm workers' cottages have been  
 bought by people moving into the area 
 and have been extended and modernised.
 Barns and hop kilns are being convert_
 ed into housing . Large houses, such  
 as Cotheridge Court, are being renov_ 
 ated and made into flats.  The land   
 belonging to Pigeonhouse Farm has     
 recently been sold and the farm house 
 turned over to residential use.       
                                       
      A number of farm houses and      
 cottages date from the 17th and 18th  
 centuries and are listed buildings.
