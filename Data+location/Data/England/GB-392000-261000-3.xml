		<content> Lower Goosehill Farm covers 300 acres.
  The farmer's family came there in    
 1945.  There are fields for growing   
 grass tp make into silage, and much of
 the land is used for grazing.  There  
 are 100 sows and 600-700 piglets;     
 there ia also a herd of Friesian cows.
  Lower Goosehill Farm also grows wheat
 and barley.  It is said that 100 years
 ago the farmhouse was hit by a        
 thunderbolt and the top part was      
 completely destroyed.  It had to be   
 rebuilt.
