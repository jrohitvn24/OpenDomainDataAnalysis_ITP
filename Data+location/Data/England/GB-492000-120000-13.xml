{provide work, housing and recreation.

{   Roger Comber}of{Manor Farm}writes a
 regular column in{ OUTLOOK }the parish
 magazine.   We  discovered  that  milk
 quotas  were  introduced on  1st April
 1984, to  reduce production throughout
 the  Common Market  just as the Spring
 drought  reduced the  silage, gathered
 in rain.  The  barley  yield  suffered
 in the summer drought  but the harvest
 of grain and straw was bone dry.      
    This year with the  cold dry spring
 the first  silage crop  was less  than
 last year. Rains  in  June  promised a
 larger second cut,  because the colder
 weather allowed the sward to grow. The
 wet  August  reduced  yields of wheat,
 barley and straw.    Late   harvesting
 meant  late  sowing for  winter grain;
 lighter crops next year.              </content>
