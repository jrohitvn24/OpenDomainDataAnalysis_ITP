		<content>  Presto has opened making many small  
{shops}close down.Even the Co-op had to
 shut down because of Presto. The      
 council has made new pavements out of 
 brick so it's easier to walk on. Also 
 new parking spaces have been made.    
  Next to the swimming pool a new{meals
{on wheels}centre is being made.As well
 as being the kitchens it's also a     
 restaurant where old people can come  
 and pop in for a bite to eat.         
  Two{motorways}have been built, the   
 M11 and the M25. They were built to   
 stop the lorries driving along the    
 little roads.                         
  The teachers strikes have been       
 affecting{schools}with many children  
 having days off, and because of       
 falling roles in primary schools one  
 of the local secondary schools will   
 have to close.
