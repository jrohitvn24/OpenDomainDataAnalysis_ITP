		<title>01Riccall and Local Area</title>
		<content>  Our square covers most of the        
 village of Riccall as well as several 
 acres of farmland. The River Ouse also
 runs through the square. In Riccall   
 there is a{Norman church}which was    
 built in 1069. The disused main       
 railway line from York to London runs 
 through this section.                 
  In the corner is Barlby Common,we    
 also have an old windmill at the top  
 of the square.                        
  Just coming out of Riccall is Riccall
 water tower,it is 80 feet tall.By the 
 tower runs the A19.Down in the far    
 corner it meets the A613 by Turn Head 
 farm.Riccall has one level crossing.  
   A new important feature is the      
 Riccall coal mine.Riccall mine is part
 of{Selby coal}field.
