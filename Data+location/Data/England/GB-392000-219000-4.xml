		<title>04MY HOUSE IN CHELTENHAM</title>
		<content> MY HOUSE IS CALLED NETHERMUIR.IT IS A 
 LARGE HOUSE WITH A DRIVE.IT HAS SIX   
 FLOORS,INCLUDING THE CELLAR,BUT WE    
 REALLY ONLY USE THREE OF THEM.THE     
 FLOOR ABOVE THE CELLAR HAS EIGHT      
 ROOMS,FOUR OF WHICH ARE BEDROOMS,ONE  
 IS A LOUNGE,ONE IS A BATHROOM AND ONE 
 IS A TOILET.THE OTHER ROOM IS A       
 KITCHEN.THE REST OF THE ROOMS ARE     
 RENTED TO PEOPLE SO WE DONT USE THEM  
 AT ALL.MOST OF OUR FURNITURE IS EITHER
 OLD FASHIONED OR ANTIQUE.THE MOST     
 MODERN FACILITY IS THE VIDEO          
 RECORDER.MY FAVOURITE ROOM IS THE     
 LOUNGE BECAUSE I CAN GO THERE TO      
 RELAX OR PLAY.
