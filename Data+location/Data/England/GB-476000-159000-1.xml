		<title>01Eversley Village</title>
		<content>   {  Eversley}is mentioned in the     
 original Domesday Book. The name means
 Boar's Meadow. It is scattered over a 
 wide, rural area of forest and        
 farmland, but the three main areas are
 The Street, The Centre and Lower      
 Common. The village has grown from two
 smaller villages. The school links    
 the area geographically while the     
 church is a little distance away on a 
 site of pre-Christian worship. The    
 population is about 1,500.The forest  
 is owned by The Forestry Commission.  
 It is mainly evergreen and surrounds a
 quarry where gravel is extracted. The 
 farmland is mixed, growing things like
 cereals and potatoes. There are a few 
 sheep and many cows and poultry.      
   {Charles Kingsley}was the rector of 
 Eversley from 1844-1875. He founded   
 the local school, which is named after
 him, in 1853.                         </content>
