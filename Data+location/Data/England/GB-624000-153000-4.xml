		<title>04A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> It is a quarter past eight and I have 
 just woken up, I never feel like      
 getting up.  I plod downstairs and eat
 breakfast. I get dressed. It's 8.25   
 and we get into the car for school.   
 When we get to school we play until   
 9.00 then we go into work until about 
 10.40 and play again till 11.00 then  
 we go in and work again until 12.00.  
 For lunch you can have either a school
 meal or a Packed Lunch.  We have lunch
 break until 1.30 and go home at 3.30. 
 In the evening we play games: Ludo,   
 Snakes and Ladders and sometimes play 
 our recorders or visit friends, then  
 we have our tea. We watch Television  
 until bed at 9.00.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
