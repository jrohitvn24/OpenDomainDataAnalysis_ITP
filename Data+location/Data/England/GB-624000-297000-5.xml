 Cockerels, in all stages of growth,   
 are reared free_range on 6_7 acres.   
 Eggs are produced in Battery houses.  
 Pigs are kept for pork production.    
 Ducks are farmed by Brooders. They are
 bought in at 1 day old. They need to  
 be vaccinated and to  sterilise their 
 brood. They are kept until 3.5 weeks  
 old, the last 5 days being spent out  
 on grass depending on the weather. The
 ducks are then sent out of the area to
 the Fatteners.
