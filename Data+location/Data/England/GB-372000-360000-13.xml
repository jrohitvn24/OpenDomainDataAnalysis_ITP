 geared to milking twice daily each day
 of the year.The morning milking       
 session beginning at approximately    
 6.30pm:the afternoon session at about

     As in most of the British Isles,  
 the 'herringbone' milking parlour is  
 the most popular with local farmers.  
 This system was first introduced into 
 this country from New Zealand in 1956.
 It is particularly suitable for farms 
 which have milking herds of between 50
 -300 cows.                            
     The herds comprising of mainly    
 British Friesian or a Friesian -      
 Holstein cross produce on average 5000
 litres per cow per annum.The British  
 Holstein is in the eyes of many local 
 farmers becoming the highest yielding 
 and fastest growing British dairy     
 breed.                                </content>
