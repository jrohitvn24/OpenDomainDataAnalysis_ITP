		<title>04My Sunday In Fulwood.</title>
		<content> A usual Sunday starts at about        
 10.00am when I get my breakfast and   
 feed my pet guinea-pigs. I then make  
 some toasted buns for my family. I go 
 out to play with our 'gang' in some   
 suitable clothes like jeans and a     
 baggy comfy jumper. We play games like
 Kit Kan, hide and seek or man-hunt.   
 Then we come back and go swimming at  
 our local leisure centre. We come back
 to a previously prepared dinner of    
 something like a casserole. After     
 lunch we go out to play again in the  
 field behind our house. Later we may  
 go to the countryside for a drive or a
 walk. At tea-time we have some        
 sandwiches and fruit or cake and then 
 go out to play again. When I come in I
 have a bath and supper and go to bed. 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
