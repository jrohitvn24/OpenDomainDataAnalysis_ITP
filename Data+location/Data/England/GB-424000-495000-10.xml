		<title>10R.A.F.Catterick</title>
		<content> Soon after the founding of the{R.A.F. 
{Regiment}in the early 1940s R.A.F.    
 Catterick was designated as the       
 Regimental Depot and has continued    
 this role ever since. The Regiment was
 started primarily to defend R.A.F.    
 bases throughout the world.The courses
 that are run at R.A.F.Catterick are   
 very much concerned with this work,and
 include fighting fires on aircraft.   
 Old planes are brought in and set on  
 fire to create true conditions for    
 this hazardous training. It is also   
 possible to see personnel receiving   
 training in parachuting and gunnery.  
 One of about five{R.A.F.Bands}is based
 here and does much effective work in  
 the area through schools and local    
 concerts. The Station is commanded by 
 a Group Captain and provides work for 
 many local people.
