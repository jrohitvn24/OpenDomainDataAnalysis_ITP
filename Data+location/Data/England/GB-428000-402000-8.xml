		<content> Most of the land is open fields and   
 farms.There are only a few houses and 
 no shops until we entered Hood Green.I
 was surprised to see so few animals in
 the fields,only a few cows and horses.
 There weren't many people around but  
 the ones we saw were friendly.We saw  
 very few young people most seemed     
 middle-aged (above forty years        
 old).There is no graffitti and no     
 vandalism.Allthe streets are tidy and 
 free from litter,as are the woods and 
 fields.
