     The last week of the Summer term  
 at Axminster school is called Project 
 week. During this week the schools    
 normal time table is suspended and    
 pupils and staff have an opportunity  
 to take part in a varity of           
 activities.                           
     This year the projects varied from
 a seven day holiday in Holland to     
 sailing on the Exe.The projects try to
 give pupils an opportunity to take    
 part in some activity that would      
 normally not be possible.             
     For many pupils project week      
 represents their only summer holiday  
 and for many it is the first time that
 they will have spent time away from   
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
