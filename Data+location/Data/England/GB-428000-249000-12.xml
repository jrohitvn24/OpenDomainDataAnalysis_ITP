		<content> Mrs. Wheildon continues:              
 "The country people had a battery     
 radio no T.V..They found entertainment
 from whist drives,dances,and very     
 occasional trips to Stratford by      
 train,plus such events as flower      
 shows,fetes,and Church affairs.There  
 was also the allotments to look       
 after,which provided extra,much       
 needed,vegetables.Things have         
 certainly altered over the            
 years.Houses have been modernized,at  
 least one car per family is a must and
 many have two or even three.Buses are 
 very infrequent and expensive,and the 
 railway has gone.The railway line is  
 now just a straight track,and has     
 largely become overgrown and almost   
 impassable,and is a haven for         
 wildlife,which is jealously guarded.  
 The cottage pig has gone and the pig  
 killer is no longer seen in winter".  </content>
