		<content> 1.    Crops other than grass          
  There is very little cultivation of  
 this kind in the area. Three hill     
 farms NW of Sampford Spiney grow some 
 cereal. To the west there is a barn,  
 converted into Coomhill Cottage with  
 12 acres of which 4 acres are sugar   
 beet and 3 acres are potatoes. One or 
 two crops of kale are grown.          
 2. Intensively managed grassland      
 Gee's Eastontown, Sampford Spiney     
 ploughs and reseeds for grass. At     
 Merrivale Farm several fields are laid
 down for hay.                         
 3. Enclosed Rough Grazing             
 Practically allthe farmland falls into
 this category. The enclosures,        
 originally traditional stone walls,   
 are often dilapidated and have been   
 supplemented with barabed wire        
 fencing, much of which is not         
 stock-proof.                          </content>
