		<title>15A SATURDAY DIARY</title>
		<content> A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KATHERINE KERR   
 (AGE 12 YEARS).                       
 I got up at 7am and had cereal for    
 breakfast. I put on grey trousers and 
 pink and white blouse with my red     
 jelly shoes. Then I went to the       
 hairdresser's. Afterwards I changed   
 into a white tennis skirt and T-shirt,
 with plimsoles ready for tennis. After
 playing I had a lunch of bread and    
 steak. I went shopping in Woking by   
 car with Jenny and her dad. We came   
 back and I had tea which was a green  
 salad. My family and I then went by   
 car to a Swim, Disco, Bar-B-Q at      
 Guildford Lido. I did a sponsored swim
 for money for secondary school P.T.A. 
 I had a hot-dog. Later we came home   
 and watched "Live Aid" on TV, a       
 charity concert in aid of the famine  
 in Ethiopia. I went to bed at 11pm but
 the concert lasted for 16 hours.      </content>
