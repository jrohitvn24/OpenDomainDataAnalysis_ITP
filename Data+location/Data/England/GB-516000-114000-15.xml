		<content> In a survey of the nineteen children  
 in Ashurst School's junior class:     
 18 fathers were in work.  Only one    
 worked in Ashurst. 11 mothers worked, 
 all except the farmer's wife, worked  
 out of the area.  Only 6 of the       
 children lived in the village and     
 except for the 6 council houses the   
 property prices in Ashurst are too    
 expensive for anyone who works in     
 Ashurst to afford.  Except for a small
 cottage industry- of a rather         
 'upmarket' kind, the only work in     
 Ashurst is the pub or farming.  The   
 rest of the fathers travel to Crawley,
 Horsham, Worthing or Shoreham.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
