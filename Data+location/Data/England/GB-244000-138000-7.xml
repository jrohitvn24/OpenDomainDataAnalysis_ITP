		<title>07An interview</title>
		<content> We went to a house in Croyde Bay to   
 interview Mr &amp; Mrs Manning who are    
 about 80 and have lived here all their
 life.                                 
   They didn't have many holidays,     
 infact their first holiday was in     
  1938,and if you didn't go to work on 
 Bank Holiday you dont get paid!       
 They didn't get mains water in the    
 area until 1950! so they had to walk  
 to a pump to get water.               
   For food they would get some        
 vegetables from their garden and get  
 some rabbit.Meat then cost 10 pence a 
 lb when nowadays it might cost        
 1pound 50p per lb.                    
  For V.E Day celebrations the people  
 of Croyde had a bonfire and the       
 children had a fancy dress party.     
  During the war the Americans were    
 using Baggy Point as a firing range.
