		<content> Although many people in this area have
 lived here for a long time there are a
 number who have moved out from the big
 cities such as London to enjoy the    
 peace of the countryside.Unfortunately
 as more people begin to do this more  
 houses are being built and the area is
 beginning to become less peaceful and 
 rural.This is of especial concern to  
 the people who first moved here for   
 peace and quiet!                      
                                       
                                       
 One particular  feature of local      
 concern at the present time is a spate
 of burglaries which have been taking  
 place in the area.A number of people  
 have had property stolen and no one   
 has been caught yet. it is widely     
 believed, despite the lack of         
 convictions, that it is the work of   
 organised gangs from London.          </content>
