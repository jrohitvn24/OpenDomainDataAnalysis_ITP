		<title>14The Veterinary Surgery</title>
		<content> The surgery has been opened on the    
 estate  because most of the people who
 live there have pets. Most of the     
 patients are dogs and cats but they   
 have treated a jackdaw and a snake.   
 The lady who we interviewed there said
 that she liked her job because she    
 could help animals that are suffering 
 but that it was very sad when they had
 to put animals down. The surgery has  
 been opened for one year now. The     
 worst disease that they have treated  
 is leukaemia which one dog suffered   
 from. The most popular breed of dog in
 the area is the labrador.
