 captain who used to sail around the   
 world in sailing ships.His first      
 sailing was in 1919 at the age of 15.

 age of 24.A Mr.Everett has lived in   
 Roos since 1908 and attended Roos     
 School,where there were three teachers

 work,aged 13 years,leaving school     
 early because of the war.He worked at 
 Ogram's farm for 15/-a week.Every     
 Sunday they went to the Primitive
