The village of Great Doddington had    
suffered, like many villages and towns 
in the area, with a considerable amount
of traffic cutting through the village 
to reach the A45 to Northampton.       
Recently a new dual-carriageway was    
built in the Nene Valley considerably  
decreasing the traffic flow. We        
completed a twelve-hour traffic survey 
of the traffic through the village in  
May and compared it with a similar     
survey carried out by the school in    
May 1981. The total number of vehicles 
counted were: from Earls Barton 1121,  
a reduction of 47.2%; from             
Wellingborough 922, a reduction of     
56.5%. More significant was the        
reduction in lorry traffic 67.9% from  
Earls Barton and 74.3% from            
Wellingborough.                        
                                       </content>
