 1B surveyed roughly 50 different      
 people about what games they play or  
 played when they were younger. The    
 information was collected on survey   
 sheets, and compared to what games we 
 played now.The ages surveyed were from
 adult to infant.                      
 The most popular games seem to be     
 games using balls, e.g. football and  
 rounders; games of violence, e.g.     
 British Bulldog; and games such as    
 tag, e.g. 999.                        
 According to our survey most games    
 played now have some ancestor played  
 years ago, e.g. 999 and Colt 45       
 evolved from simple games of tag.In   
 some of the games some of the rules   
 have changed but most of them are very
 similar.Some games have died out:     
 Marbles and Conkers. Conkers died out 
 here because of school rules.         </content>
