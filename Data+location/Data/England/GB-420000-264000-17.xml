		<content>{FISHING}: My hobby is fishing, you    
 need a fishing rod, some bait a       
 fishing line and some hooks.  You put 
 the line on the rod and the hook on   
 the end of the line.  The bait goes on
 the hook and can be maggots, worms or 
 bread.  I like my hobby because you   
 can see what is in the lake.          
{COLLECTING OLD COINS AND BOTTLES }:   
 My hobby is collecting old objects,   
 like old bottles and old coins.  My   
 oldest coin was made in 1961 and my   
 oldest bottle is about 100 years old. 
 All you need is a spade, a strong     
 wooden box and, if possible, a metal  
 detector.                             
{BADMINTON}: My hobby is Badminton, to 
 play it you need a raquet, a net and a
 shuttlecock. You must not let the     
 shuttlecock hit the ground or go out  
 of court and it must go over the net.
