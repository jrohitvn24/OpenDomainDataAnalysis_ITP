		<content>In the summer we change our time to    
British summer time.This is part of our
local history.A man called William     
Willlet thought of the idea and started
to campaign for daylight saving in     
1907.Parliament adopted his idea in    
1916 as a wartime economy.William      
Willet died in 1915 at the age of      
59.He was buried in St.Nicholas church 
graveyard.                             
Not far from the church is the         
cockpit.The cockpit was used for       
cock-fighting.It is a big hollow dip   
in the ground and is still in perfect  
condition.After cock-fighting was      
banned in 1834,the cockpit was used    
for other activities during the annual 
fair.Both the cockpit and the church   
are on the common.Most of the common   
is owned by the National Trust.
