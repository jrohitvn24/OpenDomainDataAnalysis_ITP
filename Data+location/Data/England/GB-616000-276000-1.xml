 growing cereals, sugar beet and rape  
 with intensive grazing on water       
 meadows bordering the Rivers Waveney  
 and Dove. Rsidential areas are Hoxne  
 village,upper and lower Oakley Streets

 date, although some are earlier and   
 there are some recent buidings (mostly
 brick and tile) Hoxne is a small but  
 viable, active village (despite poor  
 transport facilitis) still retaining  
 essential services e.g school,doctor, 
 village hall and a strong senes of

 (including rape processing, intensive

 towns (Diss,Eye and Stradbroke)       </content>
