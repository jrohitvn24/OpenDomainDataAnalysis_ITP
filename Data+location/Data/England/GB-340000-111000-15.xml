		<title>15Toys we play with</title>
		<content> The type of toys I play with are 'My  
 Little Ponies' which are ponies with  
 funny names like Peachy, Applejack,   
 Seashell and Cotton Candy. They are   
 rubber, hand sized ponies with long   
 tails and a long mane and they are all
 different colours. I also like playing
 tennis with a ball and two tennis     
 rackets. I like playing with dolls and
 Sindys which are small dolls with lots
 of clothes to go with them. I have a  
 bike which I ride on a lot. Another   
 type of toy we play with are computer 
 games. Some are logic games where you 
 are given questions to answer, or     
 adventure games where you solve clues 
 to find the answers. There are lots of
 other computer games like Big Trak.   
 You can make it travel by giving it   
 instructions of left and right,       
 forwards and backwards.
