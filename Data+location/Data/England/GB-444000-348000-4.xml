		<content> We have riding stables where some     
 children have lessons every week.     
 In the Parish Hall, the Drama Group   
 put on two or three productions during
 the year. On our local park there is a
 B.M.X. track,jogging track,tennis     
 courts a new bowling green and        
 football pitches. We have two football
 teams, Brinsley Youth and Brinsley    
 Magpies. Our villages main attraction 
 is our annual Carnival, this takes    
 months of organising by the Carnival  
 Committee. The Carnival Queen is      
 chosen by the children at school. The 
 Queens float leads the Carnival       
 procession of decorated floats through
 the village. The Carnival is always a 
 huge success. The Carnival Committee  
 also organise a Firework Display every
 year in November and the same         
 Committee, with Santa on his sleigh,  
 go round the village each Christmas.  </content>
