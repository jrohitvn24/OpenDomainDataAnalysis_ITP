		<title>03History of Cannock Chase</title>
		<content> {900 years ago}the Chase was not used 
for settlement because the soil was too
sandy and poor to grow crops. The oak  
forests were used for hunting.         
 {In 1290} the Royal Estates and       
hunting rights passed from the King to 
the Bishops of Lichfield.              
 {In the 16th Century} the forests     
were cut down for charcoal burning.    
The charcoal was used in the local     
iron industry. Soon the Chase became   
bare and bleak. Sheep nibbled off any  
new tree shoots.                       
 {During World War I}there were 2      
large training camps on Cannock Chase, 
and in World War II there was an       
R.A.F. training camp.                  
{In the 1920's} new trees were         
planted by the Forestry Commission.    
There are lots of coniferous and       
deciduous trees on the Chase now and   
lots of picnic spots.                  </content>
