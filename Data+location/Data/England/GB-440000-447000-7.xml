		<content>  Wetherby Swimming Pool has been open 
 for ten years and the present manager 
 has been there since it opened. The   
 pool is very popular and during the   
 week about 2500 people use it. At the 
 weekend an additional 1000 people go  
 swimming. The pool opens 7 days a week
 between 9am and 7:30pm and then until 
 10:30pm for swimming clubs. There are 
 30 sessions of swimming lessons in a  
 week and the youngest toddler swimming
 is three years old. Twenty eight      
 schools in the area use the swimming  
 pool each week for lessons. There are 
 9 instructors and they all have very  
 high qualifications. Apart from the   
 pool there is a health suite which    
 has a sauna, a solarium, sunbeds and  
 a gymnasium. Keep-fit classes are also
 held for both men and women.
