		<title>04Great Links Tor</title>
		<content>   {Great Links Tor } is possibly the  
 most imposing tor in the block. It is 
 best viewed from the the east where   
 the towers of granite that crown it   
 have their most imposing aspect.      
    The tor rises to 586 metres.       
 Approched from {Dicks Well}the        
 climb  is not so steep as when        
 coming from the west. Just on the edge
 of the block near Great Links Tor one 
 can see the remains of a house. This  
 is called{Bleak House,}and was erected
 in connection with peat workings. All 
 that remains of the house now though  
 is part of the walls. It is an        
 evocative sight against the grandure  
 of the tors to find a house in such a 
 remote spot.                          
    If the wind does not blow you over 
 the view from Great Links Tor is      
 magnificent.
