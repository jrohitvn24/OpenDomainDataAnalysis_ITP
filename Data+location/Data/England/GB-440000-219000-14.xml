		<title>14Wootton Then and Now.</title>
		<content>Mr. M. Hallam,a local history expert   
came to school and showed slide        
pictures of what Wootton was like at   
the turn of the century.Interestingly, 
the census returns show that the       
highest level of population has only   
been 1,200, today it is only about 700.
This shows that the village has hardly 
expanded.                              
Obviously there has been some new      
housing,but very little has changed    
over the years.There used to be two    
butchers shops a blacksmith,a baker's,a
slaughter house and a cobbler's        
shop.Now in 1985 we only have one      
village shop,and most people have to go
to the town to do their major shopping.
