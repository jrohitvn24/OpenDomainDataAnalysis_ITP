		<title>15TREVAYLOR WOODS.</title>
		<content>  In Trevaylor woods there are beech,  
 oak,sycamore,pines and rhododendrons. 
 These were planted in Victorian times;
 they grow beside the stream and       
 in-amongst the trees.As well as       
 rhododendrons there are bluebells.    
 There are lots of animals and birds   
 and plenty of homes in the woods for  
 them.There are vandals who go into the
 woods at night and chop down small    
 trees and saplings for firewood. The  
 majority of saplings are{beech,}which 
 are protected by plastic tubes around 
 them.In the woods there is a stream   
 called Trevaylor stream which runs    
 through the woods and into Gulval. The
 woods are nice and cool om a hot day. 
  The woods grow on the land of        
 Rosemorran Farm, Gulval. The woods are
 quiet and shady.
