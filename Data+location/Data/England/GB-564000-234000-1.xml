		<title>01THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> This area is a very rural area. There 
 are about nineteen farms and they are 
 nearly all arable farms.There are     
 several moats,two springs and one well
 in the rectangle two.The River Pant   
 runs through this area. There are only
 two main roads running through here   
 .There is an old airfield. The main   
 roads both come from Wimbish.One of   
 the roads goes through Great Sampford 
 and the other one goes back to        
 Wimbish. There are remains of a Roman 
 Road in the neighbourhood.There is a  
 large Manor House called Tindon End   
 Manor to the south of the rectangle.  
 Several children who go to our school 
 live in this rectangle.The children   
 who live in the west of the rectangle 
 go to Wimbish School or to Thaxted    
 School.
