		<title>17Children's Games In School 2</title>
		<content>  The most popular games children play 
 on their own are card games such as   
 "Patience" and "What";Dominoes,       
 particularly setting them up for a    
 "domino fall", and skipping.          
  The girls like playing a game called 
 "Flooret" where they do handstands.   
 Many of the children play ballgames   
 either on their own or in small       
 groups, and have rhymes to chant as   
 they play.  These rhymes also apply to
 skipping, where two children swing a  
 rope whilst another child jumps over. 
      "Salt mustard vinegar pepper."   
  Many of the girls enjoy playing a    
 form of jumping game which involves   
 two children standing a little way    
 appart with a length of elastic around
 their legs which another child has to 
 jump over in various ways.            
  Many of the boys enjoy playing pocket
 sized electronic games.               </content>
