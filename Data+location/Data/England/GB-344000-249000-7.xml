		<content> There are several stories explaining  
 the existence of the two conical      
 shaped hills in Canon Pyon known as   
{Pyon Hill and Butthouse Knapp}and     
 sometimes as 'Robin Hood's Butts'.They
 were called by the latter name because
 it was said Robin Hood could stand on 
 one and shoot an arrow into a tree on 
 top of the other.Other stories from   
 the past mix{Robin Hood}and the{Devil.
 It is said that the Devil was so      
 incensed by the piety of the people of
{Hereford}that he planned to bury or   
 drown the city.He filled two sacks    
 with earth from{Dinmore Hill.}In one  
 version he was persuaded by a Holy man
 that Hereford was a wicked city,and in
 the other the cock crew so he emptied 
 his loads.In another story Little John
 and Robin Hood jumped over Wormsley   
 Hill from Brinsop and kicked off two  
 pieces of hill so forming the Pyons.  </content>
