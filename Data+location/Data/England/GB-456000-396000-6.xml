		<title>06LOVERSALL WATER PUMP</title>
		<content> Loversall water pump is on the        
 outskirts of Loversall, the pump is   
 next to a stream by the main road. In 
 the late Victorian stage the pump     
 was used to provide drinking water for
 the village. The water came from the  
 well at St.Catherines spring about a  
 quarter of a mile away, a ram pump was
 used to pump water to a settling tank 
 behind the wheel at Loversall. The    
 slow flowing stream powered the wheel 
 which then pumped the water up to the 
 village. To power the wheel the stream
 has to be dammed and the water        
 chanelled off to power the breast shot
 wheel. The wheel then drove a pump    
 which raised the water level by 10    
 foot to the village above.            
 Mr.Henderson started to renovate      
 the pump in 1976 with the help of the 
 council and now has it in working     
 order.                                </content>
