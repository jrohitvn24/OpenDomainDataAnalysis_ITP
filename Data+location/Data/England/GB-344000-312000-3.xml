		<title>03SHELTON OAK COTTAGES.</title>
		<content> Shelton Oak Cottages is a long row of 
 cottages built in orange bricks. The  
 first part was built in about 1750 and
 it was added  to between 1800 and     
 1850. Some of the original walls were 
 made of wattle and daub but they have 
 since been plastered over. The bedroom
 floors are polished oak and many of   
 them slope towards the doors. In the  
 oldest cottage some of the walls are  
 timber framed and there are two big   
 inglenook fireplaces.                 
   The row of cottages was built on the
 site of an old manor home. Under the  
 lawns a cobbled yard has been found.  
   The soil is very good and everything
 grows well because it has been        
 cultivated as a garden for a long     
 time.                                 
   Shelton probably means 'town on a   
 shelf above the river'.
