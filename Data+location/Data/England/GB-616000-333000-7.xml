 to turn the heating on. My dad goes to
 work in Aylsham at 8.15am. His work   
 can take him to Wales. Michael and I  
 get up at 8am. Mum works in Cromer    
 for British Telecom. In holiday time  
 dad looks after us. Michael helps dad 
 do the painting while I make them a   
 cup of tea. Mum gets home at midday to
 cook the lunch. After that we watch   
 the Friday Film. Then I go to my      
 nan's house to do organ practice.     
 Lucy writes about life at the pub. She
 gets up at 7am with breakfast of      
 cereal and coffee. At 11am the pub    
 is opened up. It has recently been    
 altered and modernised. At 2.30pm the 
 pub closes and they often go to North 
 Walsham shopping in the car. Her      
 favourite evening meal is fish and    
 chips. Then it's opening time at 7pm. 
 Closing time is at 11pm.              </content>
