		<content>   Houses vary in age, one at 100 years
 old used to be a chapel. A block of   
 semi-detached houses was built after  
 the second world war. There is little 
 new housing but old housing is being  
 renovated.                            
   Families average two to three       
 children with ages spread evenly.     
 There is no age group predominance.   
 Women generally have a traditional    
 role in the family doing household    
 chores.Cats and dogs are kept as pets.
   Those who live in the area choose to
 live there because of its quiet rural 
 atmosphere. They largely commute to   
 work.
