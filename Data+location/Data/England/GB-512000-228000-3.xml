		<content> We asked about'ghosts'!The presence   
 of a young woman is occasionally felt 
 in an upstairs room.She supposedly    
 witnessed the death of her beloved,a  
 Cavalier,when he was killed by        
 Roundheads in the courtyard.It is     
 this demented girl who can be'felt'in 
 the bedroom.The only modernisation    
 seemed to be central heating and a    
 swimming pool.The Lady of the house,  
 plus a daily help,keep the house in   
 order.We saw the fine gardens,and the 
 interesting architectural features i.e
 Tudor archways,coats_of_arms,and very 
 old stables.Pheasant rearing is a     
 family interest with eight'shoots' a  
 year.Apart from pheasants they rear   
 the Redlegged Partridge,endangered by 
 insecticides in the surrounding       
 fields.There are 320 acres of land,a  
 combination of woods,crops and cattle.
 A lovely afternoon of living history. </content>
