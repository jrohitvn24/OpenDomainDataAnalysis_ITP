		<content> There are a number of ghost stories   
 connected with the area but few have  
 any real substance.                   
 The only one which appears to have    
 been written about is the "Cross Yates
 Boggle".The story goes that one night 
 while walking home from the pub a man 
 saw something white going into the    
 shadow of an ash tree.The story was   
 used to frighten people but the       
 presence of a white horse in the      
 vicinity would indicate that the      
 story, despite its following, is to be
 taken very much tongue in cheek.      
 There is also another ghost or        
 "Boggle" that is supposed to haunt    
 Scalla Beck.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
