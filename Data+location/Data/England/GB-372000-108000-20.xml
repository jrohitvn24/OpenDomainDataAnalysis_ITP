		<content>   The North Aisle is a war memorial   
 Chapel. In the porch the name         
 Hazelbury Bryan has been arased       
 because of the danger of invasion in  
 1940. It is a memorial of the enemys' 
 defeat. The tower is over 60 feet and 
 yet the belfry windows are small. A   
 scratch dial of the middle ages can be
 seen near the ground, and a more      
 modern sundial is further up. The     
 church has six bells, a poor lands    
 charity tablet records that a rent is 
 paid forcertain fields in the village 
 and is distributed to the poor.       
   The lecturn has a black oak section 
 which originated from a pile of a     
 Roman bridge. Fragments of old stained
 glass are in the East window of the   
 chancel retieved after the dustruction
 by the Roundheads.
