		<title>12Employment _ in the Area</title>
		<content>  Much of the area is agricultural land
 so there is a background of employment
 in farming and agricultural services. 
 However, with increased               
 mechanisation,fewer people are        
 employed on the land though there is  
 seasonal work such as potato picking. 
 Strangely enough there is the heavy   
 engineering{Newell Dunford}works      
 (manufacturing such things as huge    
 crushers),{Brealeys}making conveyor   
 belt machinery and{Misterton Castings 
 ;these are all at Misterton as is the 
 firm of{Corah}who mainly manufacture  
 underwear and are the largest         
 employers of female labour            
 The three Trent Valley C.E.G.B.       
 Stations are important employers.     
 Residents commute to nearby towns such
 as Doncaster, Gainsborough, Retford   
 and even Sheffield.
