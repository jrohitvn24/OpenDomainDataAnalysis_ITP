 MANY VISITORS ARE UNAWARE OF THE      
 PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL IN WOOKEY HOLE   
 WHICH IS PART OF THE CAVES COMPLEX.   
 THERE IS A MAIN POOL, WITH DIVNG      
 BOARDS AND SLIDE, TOGETHER WITH A     
 PADDLING POOL AND SUNBATHING TERRACES.
 NEARBY IS A RESTURAUNT AND A GIFT SHOP
 WHICH SELLS CONFECTIONERY AND         
 SOUVENIRS.                            
   THE VILLAGE SHOP AND POST OFFICE IS 
 AN INTERESTING BUILDING AS IT IS AT   
 LEAST 200 YEARS OLD.                  
   CLOSE TO THE OLD PAPER MILL IS THE  
 WOOKEY HOLE BOWLING GREEN WHOSE CLUB  
 MEMBERS ARE OFTEN TO BE SEEN DRESSED  
 IN WHITE.                             
   THE WOOKEY HOLE SOCIAL CLUB, BUILT  
 IN 1884,HAS SEEN LITTLE CHANGE SINCE, 
 EXCEPT THE ADDITION OF A SKITTLE ALLEY
 BUILT IN THE ASSEMBLY ROOM FORMERLY   
 USED BY THE VILLAGERS.                </content>
