		<title>19HOUSING IN SKEGNESS.</title>
		<content> In our block there seem to be two very
 different areas of housing.That is a  
 large Council Estate and then private 
 housing.                              
 The Council Estate is in the Tennyson 
 Green/Sandbeck Avenue area.It was     
 built around 1940..that is straight   
 after the second world war.The people 
 who live in Council houses pay a rent 
 to the{Skegness Town Council.}This is 
 a subsidised rent which also includes 
 rates and land drainage rates.Recently
 national laws have been passed which  
 allow council tenants to buy their    
 houses at a favourable rate.          
   The private housing in our area is  
 made up of many different styles,     
 though much of it is bungalow         
 development. While there are some     
 bungalow estates which were built in  
 the late 1960's much of it is older   
 and developed without any overall plan</content>
