		<title>13TYTHERINGTON SCHOOL CLOSURE</title>
		<content> The village school was closed at the  
 end of the Summer term in{1983. 28}   
 pupils were attending the school when 
 it closed. The{local authority}closed 
 the school for many reasons, such as{ 
{falling pupil numbers}and{rising costs
 of educational equipment. Many of the 
 children who went to the school now go
 to either{St.Helen's}in{Alveston}or{  
{Marlwood.}Some of the local people    
 campaigned for two years to keep the  
 school open, but failed. We asked a   
 sample of local people if they agreed 
 with the closure, and the results     
 were:-                                
                                       
{66%}wanted the school to stay open;   
{33%}wanted the school to close;       
{1% }did not care.
