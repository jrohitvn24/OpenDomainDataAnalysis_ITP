		<title>16The Cheshire Home Gt.Bromley</title>
		<content>   The first{Cheshire Homes}were set up
 after{World War 2 (1939-1945)},when   
 many people had nowhere to live and   
 could not look after themselves.Local 
 people began leaving food outside for 
 them.The number of people doing this  
 grew until there was enough support to
 build a home. There are now{50 homes }
 like this in the U.K.,named after     
{Group Captain Leonard Cheshire}. The  
 Captain was an R.A.F. pilot in World  
 War 2, who was present when the{1st   
{atomic bomb}was dropped on{Hiroshima,}
{Japan}.After the war he dedicated his 
 life to caring for people.            
 In the home at Gt.Bromley there are{28
 residents and 48 staff.We interviewed 
 one of the residents who was blind and
 has had Multiple Sclerosis since she  
 was 25.She is now 76.                 
 Hamilton Lodge-a home for the{mentally
{handicapped}is also in Great Bromley. </content>
