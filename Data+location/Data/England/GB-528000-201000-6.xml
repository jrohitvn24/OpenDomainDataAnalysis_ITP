		<content> The brothers of the Hospitaller Order 
 of St. John own St. Raphael's,Barvin  
 Park. They take care of mentally      
 handicapped men and women under the   
 charge of six monks and fifty other   
 staff. St.Raphael's cares for these   
 people and gives them work and        
 shelter.At present there are one      
 hundred and twenty men and just five  
 women,although it is hoped more women 
 will be admitted gradually.It was     
 purchased in 1930 and the original    
 house is now used for administration.A
 villa was built in 1955, then the     
 Pavilion was added.Ambitious plans are
 now underway to develop a 'village'   
 where the residents can live in normal
 houses and the institutionalised      
 buildings will be converted.Farming,  
 gardening and craftwork is all well   
 organised there and the public may buy
 produce from the greenhouses there.   </content>
