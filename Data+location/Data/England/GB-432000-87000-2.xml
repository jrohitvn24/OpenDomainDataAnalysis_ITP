		<title>02N.W.AREA I.W.NORTON GREEN</title>
		<content>  A small hamlet of houses lying on the
 west side of the River Yar.It is      
 thought that Norton Green was at one  
 time a fishing village and was much   
 nearer to the river. As the river     
 altered its course,the hamlet is now  
 1km from the river. It still has a    
 shop and a post office, although the  
 village inn has closed. Golden Hill   
 Fort and its country park overshadows 
 Norton on its southern side with a    
 small caravan site catering for       
 tourists.
