		<title>11THE LAKES NATIONAL PARK</title>
		<content>  The{Lake District National Park      
 covers 2279sq. kms of{Cumbria.}The    
 western half of our block is in the   
 park. The county has great attraction 
 to tourists. The National Park is set 
 up mainly for the benefit of visitors 
 but also for residents who care for   
 it. The{Lake District Special Planning
{Board}administers new building and    
 redevelopment and other facets which  
 may change the area's appearance. It  
 bears in mind the diverse needs of    
{tourists, residents, farmers and      
{wildlife.}Usually, this has little    
 effect on farmers who can exercise    
 similar activities to any other       
 farmers. The National Park status does
 not imply that all land within its    
 boundary is open to the public. There 
 are hundreds of miles of public       
 footpaths through the valleys and the 
 felltops have almost open access.     </content>
