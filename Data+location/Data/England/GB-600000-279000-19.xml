		<title>19BLO'NORTON HALL/USERS.</title>
		<content>   The Village Hall stands on{LAND     
 donated by the lord of the Manor,and  
 was funded initially by a loan of Â£150
 from three residents, being repaid    
 subsequently by the Hall Management   
 Committee. It is a prefabricated      
 building, somewhat in need of redecor-
 ation but providing the only secular  
{FOCAL POINT}in the village. It has a  
 permanent stage, kitchen facilities, a
 bar and a lounge.                     
   To the rear there is a recreational 
 area of land with some children's play
 apparatus. Perhaps due to the small,  
 scattered nature of the village there 
 are only a few communal{ORGANISATIONS.
 There is a W.I. founded 35 years ago, 
 which meets monthly and gives aid to  
 village activities, a Social Club and 
 a keep fit class. There is an annual  
 Harvest Supper &amp; the hall is used for 
 Council meetings during the summer.   </content>
