		<title>19Two clubs in Cotteridge</title>
		<content>I go to{boxing}twice a week. It costs  
fifty pence each night for about three 
hours. My trainer is Paddy Benson. We  
do{excercises}such as press ups, tuck  
jumps, squat thrusts and snake dives.  
There are two types of guard used when 
boxing, called South Paw and Orthodox. 
{I am a south paw}which means that I   
lead with my right and follow up with  
my left. About twenty people go to the 
boxing club. Most are teenagers. The   
club starts at 6 pm and is held in a   
hall behind Kings Norton Library. The  
club is called{The Alpha Club.}When we 
are twelve years old we become{amateur 
fighters}and enter exhibitions.        
I belong to the{TSB Club.}It costs 50p 
to start an account. It is an idea to  
{help children to save.}If I want to   
save more money I fill in a form for   
the cashier who types it into my book. 
It tells me how much I have saved.     </content>
