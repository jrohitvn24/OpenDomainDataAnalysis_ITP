		<title>07THE SHIP INN, KILNHURST</title>
		<content>   The Ship Inn is the oldest pub and  
 the third oldest building in          
 Kilnhurst.  It was first built as a   
 house in 1780 and then later, probably
 when the canal was first made, it     
 became a public house.  Extra         
 buildings were added on over the      
 years.  The Ship Inn used to be called
 The Pub Under the Bridge because it is
 so close to the canal and railway     
 bridge.  Where the bar is now used to 
 be the rooms belonging to that first  
 house.  The garage used to be the     
 stables for the barge horses and above
 the garage used to be a hayloft.  Next
 to the hayloft was a room which was   
 once used for church services before  
 St. Thomas's Church was built.  That  
 room is now being made into a         
 restaurant.  The cellar is on ground  
 level because the inn is too near the 
 canal to have an underground cellar.  </content>
