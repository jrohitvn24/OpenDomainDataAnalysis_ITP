		<title>11A New Family.</title>
		<content>     I am part of a family which has   
 recently moved here. We moved here    
 because of my{dad's job.}I have no    
 brothers or sisters. My dad's job is  
{personnel manager}for a company which 
 makes robots.                         
                                       
    {My dad likes Tibberton}because it 
 is in the country but also near to    
 towns. He chose Tibberton because he  
 liked the area and it is well away    
 from the traffic.                     
                                       
     My dad likes Cricket, Squash and  
 reads Naval books, and he also likes  
 gardening.                            
                                       
     We  have all  made{quite a few    
{friends}and we think that the people  
 of Tibberton are really friendly. My  
 mother shops in{Newport}and enjoys    
 reading.                              </content>
