		<content>       The Village Hall is well used by
 many village groups and organisations.
 These include; Playschool, Badminton, 
 Luncheon Club, Women's Institute.     
 Other things which take place in the  
 Hall are Wedding Receptions and plays 
 put on by the Ightham Players.The     
 horticulural society and historical   
 society also meet in the Hall.        
       The village hall was built in   
 the 1920's,but they have had a new bit
 put on which was built in 1965. Some  
 time ago the inside was all changed   
 round.The stage used to be where the  
 kitchen is now.                       
       There have been four robberies  
 from the Hall. The first three money  
 was stolen. The last time all the     
 players costumes were taken.          
       There are four main rooms - the 
 main hall, two committee rooms and the
 kitchen.                              </content>
