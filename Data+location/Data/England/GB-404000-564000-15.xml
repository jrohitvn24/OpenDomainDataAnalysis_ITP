		<content> There are several small businesses in 
 this area,including a{nursery garden. 
 This grows and sells{herbacous plants,
{herbs}and{tomato and vegetable plants}
 in season.It is a family business that
 struggles to keep going against       
 increased competition from large      
 garden centres in the area offering   
 cut prices and attractions like       
 restaurants and play centres.         
 However it does offer employment to   
 several people,both in their nursery  
 and their shop in the{Grainger Market 
 in{Newcastle.}They have adapted to    
 local demands by keeping {goats}which 
 provide milk for children with{excema 
 and{cows milk allergy.}
