		<title>10 CREECH HILL NR BRUTON</title>
		<content>   Creech Hill lies to the north-      
west of Bruton and is one of the       
beauty spots in the area.It is a       
popular place for walking on a fresh   
and clear day.It is also a place of    
historic significance.                 
    On the top of the hill,one of the  
highest points in the area,during      
Roman times was sited a Romano-Celic   
temple and fort.One can easily         
understand the location because of the 
commanding position the hill has over  
the valleys around.                    
   Today it is just a large outcrop,set
in hilly landscape,heavily wooded with 
no visible evidence of its past.The    
slopes of the hill are used for        
motor-cycle scrambling events,very     
popular in the area.The woods are also 
used by the local farmer as a breeding-
ground for pheasants.
