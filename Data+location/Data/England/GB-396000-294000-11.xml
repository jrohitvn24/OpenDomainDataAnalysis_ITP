		<content>  The road system has been changed in  
 the last ten years to by-pass the     
 centre of Wednesbury. The High Bullen 
 is now a busy dual carriageway. There 
 are new civic amenities. A sports hall
 is now being built next to the new    
 swimming baths.                       
  The trading estate has steel stock   
 and manufacturing, a unit making      
 rubber products and a cash and carry  
 warehouse. The spires of{St Mary's}and
{St Bartholemew's}are visible for many 
 miles.{St Bart's}dates from the 15C,  
 restored in 1885.{St Mary's}was built 
 in 1874.{The Manor House,}which dated 
 from the early 12C had its site near  
 the present{St Mary's primary school.}
{The Victorian baths}were next door to 
 Squires Walk-if you look closely you  
 can see the original tiles.
