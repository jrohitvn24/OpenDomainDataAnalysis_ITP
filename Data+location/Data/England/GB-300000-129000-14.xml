		<title>14A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> A little further down the road is a   
 family who have nine children. Their  
 father is a farm helper and they live 
 in a house with only two bedrooms, so 
 all the children have to share one    
 bedroom, but they do have a big       
 television in the kitchen!            
                                       
 When my mother does the shopping my   
 mother drives into Taunton to a big   
 superstore, sometimes I help her. It  
 is fun getting all the food and drink 
 and everything else we need in one    
 shop. We go down to our village shop  
 on Sunday after church to get the     
 weekend papers and some sweets! It a  
 tiny shop but it does have lots of    
 things, we buy ham and cheese and ice 
 lollies there as well.
