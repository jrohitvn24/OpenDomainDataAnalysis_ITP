		<title>04MOAT FIELD,ABBOTS MORTON.</title>
		<content> There is no water in the moat and     
 there has not been for longer than    
 anyone in Abbots Morton can remember. 
 The moat was filled by ponds connected
 by shafts.The first pond is 3 feet 6  
 inches deep.There is another directly 
 in line with the church.No coins or   
 metal were found in the moat,which is 
 one of the highest points in Abbots   
 Morton.The field with the moat in     
 (Moat Field)is 8 acres.People think   
 the moat was very deep and was used   
 by the monks for fishing.The people   
 who own Moat Field have a farm called 
 High House Farm, which covers 350     
 acres.
