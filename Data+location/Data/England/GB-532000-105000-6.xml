		<content>  There are about{7200 students}       
 here,about 5000 of them are full time 
 the rest are part time. They are      
 taught by upto{600 lecturers}.They    
 start at 09.00 and the Polytechnic is 
 in use upto 21.00. Some of the classes
 have upto 120 students in them. There 
 are roughhly{300 foreign students}who 
 have to pay fees to go there,the rest 
 normally have a grant.                
  The Polytechnic was first built in   
 1965 and more buildings have been     
 added since.They run nearly{300}      
{different courses}; some in the day   
 and some in the evenings.No one is    
 supposed to smoke in the lessons but  
 we found lots of ashes etc. in the    
 bins as there are no ashtrays.        
  There are 1000's of rooms but it     
 would take over a week, non stop, to  
 count them all.
