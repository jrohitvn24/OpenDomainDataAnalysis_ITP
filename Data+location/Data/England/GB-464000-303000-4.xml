 from Covert Lane and Uppingham        
 Road.From the higher land in the east,
 one can see across the city of        
 Leicester as far as Bradgate Park and 
 Charnwood Forest, a hilly area formed 
 of igneous rocks and amongst the      
 oldest in the country.In the opposite 
 direction,Billesdon Coplow can be     
 seen.This well known landmark can be  
 seen for miles around.This wooded hill
 is famous in hunting circles as it    
 provides cover for many foxes.The     
 Fernie,with whom Prince Charles often 
 rides operate in ths area.The fields  
 themselves form a pleasing view at    
 different times of the year as crops  
 ripen.A wide variety of colours       
 including brown arable land,green     
 pasture,yellow oil seed rape and the  
 ripening corn, provide a pleasant     
 picture throughout the year.          </content>
