		<title>05Erosion on the River Caldew</title>
		<content> The River Caldew is a river behind the
 two Dalston schools.People in Caldew  
 school are worried because sooner or  
 later the tennis courts might         
 disappear.They're for major places of 
 erosion.200 yards (1 yard=0.9144      
 metres) from the White bridge there is
 a bank which people jump down and skid
 down the banks to the river.Very near 
 the White bridge they had a digger to 
 dig out all the stones from the river 
 bed.Where the old mill stream there is
 a tree hanging over an island now the 
 erosion is so bad they have to block  
 off the tree with wire fencing.The    
 tree would{probably help stop the     
{erosion}.If you walk down the stream  
 to a triangular section of the river  
 bank,downstream 100 yards there is    
 another major point of erosion.It is  
 so bad that they had to double fence  
 it away from the major path.          </content>
