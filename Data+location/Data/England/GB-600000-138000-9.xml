 There are two main events during the  
 Ashford Year, both have charitable    
 intent. The longer running event is   
 "Children's Day" occurring in a week  
  near to Christmas. This is not a     
 'Day' but a 'Week'. The 'Day' sees a  
 celebrity, often nationally known,    
 turning on the Christmas decoration   
 lights in the town. Local groups make 
 'floats'. The whole procession visits 
 the town areas on different nights.   
 Choirs, Bands, and Majorette groups   
 follow and street markets operate _for
 fund_raising for Senior Citizen Groups
 and individuals. Carnival Day is held 
 in the Summer, winding its way through
 the town ending somewhere for judging.
 Money raised is spread across many    
 deserving charities, from the William 
 Harvey Hospital to youth groups.
