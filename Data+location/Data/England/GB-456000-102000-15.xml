		<content> THE LAND IS FLAT EXCEPT FOR A MAN MADE
 MOUND TO THE SOUTH-EAST ON WHICH NEW  
 TREES WERE PLANTED IN 1984.  THE LAND 
 IS COVERED BY CROPS, A PLAYING FIELD, 
 SEWAGE FARM AND SEWAGE TREATMENT      
 WORKS.  THE SMELL IS OBNOXIOUS AND    
 CAUSES DISTRESS TO EVERYONE IN THE    
 AREA.  THE ROAD TO THE NORTH OF MARKS 
 ROAD HAS BEEN PLOUGHED UP AS HAVE     
 THREE FOOTPATHS.  THE RAMBLERS'       
 ASSOCIATION HAD MARKED THE PATHS WITH 
 YELLOW PEGS BUT THEY WERE REMOVED.    
                                       
 THE SOURCE OF THE RIVER ALVER HAS BEEN
 DIRECTED INTO A DITCH LEADING TO THE  
 SEWAGE WORKS.  THIS ATTRACTS SOME     
 BIRDS.  WE SAW FEW WILD FLOWERS       
                                       
 THE FEW HOUSES IN THE AREA ARE A      
 MIXTURE OF OLD AND NEW DWELLINGS.     
                                       
                                       </content>
