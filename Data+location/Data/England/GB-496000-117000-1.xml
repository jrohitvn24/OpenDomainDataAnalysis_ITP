		<title>01WEST SUSSEX - DUNCTON</title>
		<content> This area is in the centre of West    
 Sussex between Petworth and the South 
 Downs and consists of Coates,         
 Heathend, Coultershaw and half of     
 Duncton. Much of the land is          
 agricultural - the two main landowners
 being Barlavington and Leconfield     
 Estates. Tree cover is substantial but
 not complete and is mostly deciduous. 
                                       
 There are three ponds in the area,    
 Burton, Chingford, and Black, two of  
 which supply power to a renovated     
 water mill at Burton Mill. To the     
 north of Burton Mill the river Rother 
 flows in an east-west direction.      
 Ramblers using the numerous footpaths 
 find peace and tranquility. The whole 
 area is generally regarded as an area 
 of outstanding natural beauty.        
 Personal transport is essential as    
 there is little public transport.     </content>
