		<content>{DUCK DECOY}                           
 A large area of marshy land which is  
 known a{DECOY MARSH,}lies on the      
 Widnes side of the Lighthouse and     
 contains a structure known as{Hale    
{Decoy,}which has a pentagonal shape   
 and is surrounded by a moat. It is    
 thought to have been in operation     
 since{1631.}                          
 There is a pond in the middle of the  
 pentagonal and to cross the moat a    
 swing bridge is used. The whole of the
 area is surrounded by a wide belt of  
 trees.                                
 Thousands of ducks were lured into it 
 and swam along one of the five curved 
 channels leading to the caged and     
 netted area, killed and then used to  
 supplement the meat supply.           
 Today it is is preserved as an        
 Ancient Monument to protect wild      
 life.                                 </content>
