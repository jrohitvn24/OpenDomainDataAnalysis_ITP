 where people{work,}and this is what we
 found out.                            
 Many people work out of{Earith}       
 although they live in the{village. 12 
 out of the{16}people interviewed      
 worked{out of Earith}and{4 worked in  
{Earith. Most}people{travelled}over{20 
{miles}but only 2 people{less}than{5   
{miles.}The most popular{transport}was 
 the{car}because the{public transport} 
 is not very good.There is no{rail     
{service}and the{bus service}is{       
{irregular.}Most people have been      
 working less than{15 years}at their   
{present job}and only 1 person has     
 worked for 15 years.Most people work  
 under{50 hours}a week.There were only 
 7 people that worked 50 hours or more.
