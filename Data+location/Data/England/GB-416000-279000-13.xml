		<title>13THE VILLAGE BAKERY</title>
		<content>  Situated on the right bank of the    
 canal in Catherine de Barnes is the   
 village bakery. The bakery began it's 
 life as a small holding before 1899. A
 family new to the area transformed it 
 into a small bakery, serving the      
 locals and nearby Hampton and         
 Solihull. Today the bakery remains in 
 the ownership of the grandsons, who   
 work at the bakery.                   
  Although the unit is small, two      
 ovens, they produce a variety of bread
 and confectionary, to supply the      
 bakery shop and two others in         
 Solihull. Altogether 25 people,       
 including bakers, drivers and shop    
 assistants work at the bakery. The    
 late shift bake the bread and the     
 early shift produce the cakes etc.    
 Altogether 40 sizes and types of bread
 are baked each day.
