		<title>13NEW INDUSTRY IN SHILDON</title>
		<content> Since the closure of the British Rail 
 Wagon Works in 1983-84 over 50% of the
 population are unemployed.New factory 
 units have been set up, some of them  
 on the site of the Works, which was   
 demolished and the tracks taken       
 up.These include Shildon Forge. The   
 vacant buildings of Shildon Co.Junior 
 school were converted to Training     
 Workshops with reduced rents and other
 incentives for people to set up there 
 own businesses.One success from these 
 has been a school leaver who set up a 
 computer software business and has had
 so much demand for his business       
 systems that he has moved to a new    
 factory unit. Direct Worktops,a firm  
 set up by a local businessman 7 years 
 ago, is moving into purpose-built     
 premises on the outskirts of Shildon  
 costing Â£6m.This factory will         
 create some new jobs for the area.    </content>
