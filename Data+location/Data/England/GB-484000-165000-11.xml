   "I like jogging because it keeps    
 me healthy;I go jogging with my sister
 every day.I run because I like running
 and would like to run a marathon one  
 day, when I'm older. I like swimming  
 and skating too. I like any kind of   
 sport really."

 pounds and weighs 10 lbs. It is silver

 like to win the British Championship".
