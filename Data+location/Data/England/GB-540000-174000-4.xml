Eltham appears as Alteham in the       
Domesday book of 1086 and boasts a     
palace where the kings of England were 
often in residence in the 15th and 16th
centuries.But it was the coming of the 
railway which caused Eltham to grow    
from a small village to a sizeable     
town,doubling its population between   
1891 and 1911.There is a large area of 
housing alongside the railway dating   
from this time,and further expansion   
took place between the two wars.
