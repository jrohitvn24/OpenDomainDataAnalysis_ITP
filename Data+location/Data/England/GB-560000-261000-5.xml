Arable Farming: Most farms grow mainly 
cereal crops.                          
                                       
Grassland:  Stud farms are devoted to  
intensively managed grassland.         
                                       
Animals:  Sheep or bullocks are often  
turned into the paddocks for a week    
or two. They eat the coarse grass and  
manure the ground before the horses are
put in.                                
                                       
Trees:  Many fields are surrounded by  
belts of trees although some fields    
have been made larger and trees fewer. 
There are some woods of deciduous      
trees.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
