		<title>15HOWARD DAVIS PARK,ST.HELIER</title>
		<content>   This park is situated in St.Helier  
 not far from the sea.It was founded by
 T.B. Davis and opened in 1938 in      
 honour of his son Howard, who died at 
 Etables in 1916.                      
   The most striking feature of the    
 park must be the bronze statue of     
 George V just outside the main        
 entrance.It opens out onto a large    
 lawn on which people can relax,       
 sunbathe or listen to concerts from   
 the bandstand which is frequently in  
 use during the summer.                
   Flower shows are also held in the   
 park. Around the lawn itself winding  
 pathways, surrounded by bushes lead   
 you past exotic flowers into rose     
 gardens, in which fountains and ponds 
 can be found.                         
   All plants are tended daily and its 
 immaculate appearance contributes to  
 the popularity of the park.           </content>
