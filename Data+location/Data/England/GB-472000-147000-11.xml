  THERE IS VERY LITTLE ORGANISED       
 ENTERTAINMENT IN OUR AREA. THERE ARE  
 BARN DANCES AND SOCIAL EVENINGS       
 ORGANISED IN THE VILLAGE HALLS AT LONG
 SUTTON AN SOUTH WARNBOROUGH BY GROUPS 
 SUCH AS THE SCHOOL ASSOCIATION AND THE
 WOMENS INSTITUTE.  SOMETIMES THERE ARE
 DISCOS FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE BUT NOT VERY
 OFTEN. BINGO SESSIONS ARE HELD FOR    
 OLDER PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE HALLS BUT 
 NOT EVERY WEEK.  THE TWO PUBLIC HOUSES
 IN OUR BLOCK ARE PROBABLY USED MORE   
 FOR ENTERTAINMENT THAN ANY OTHER      
 FACILITY.  SOMETIMES THERE ARE JUMBLE 
 SALES OR FETES AND THEY ARE ORGANISED 
 TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITIY OR THE    
 CHURCH OR THE SCHOOL.  THE NEAREST    
 THEATRE OR CINEMA IS ABOUT 12 MILES   
 AWAY.                                 
                                       </content>
