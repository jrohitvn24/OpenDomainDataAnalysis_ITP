		<content>   Modern  {MUSIC } is  different  from
 that of  the  past. {CLASSICAL}  music
 still exists,  but  most people listen
 to {POP} music. Nowadays lots of music
 is synthesized  and  all the pop music
 now has to have a video with it.      
                                       
  People were asked who their favourite
 artists were. The results were:       
{   1}Wham!,{2}Duran Duran,{3}Bruce    
 Springsteen and {4}Michael Jackson.   
                                       
 You can buy  their songs and others on
 video, tapes and discs.               
                                       
 Also what is becoming more popular  is
{ charity music}like  The  Crowd,  Band
 Aid and  USA for  Africa. Local people
 contribute  to charity by buying these
 records.
