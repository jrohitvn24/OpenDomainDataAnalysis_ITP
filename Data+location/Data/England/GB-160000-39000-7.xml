		<title>07HIGHER KEHELLAND FARM</title>
		<content> Higher Kehelland Farm and Kieve Mill  
 Farm are two of the farms owned and   
 worked by the Bennet family.The entire
 holding consists of about 240 acres.  
 There is a small beef herd of Friesian
 and Hereford cross cattle which were  
 inside at the time of our visit. They 
 were due to be moved outside once the 
 sileage had been cut.This is done to  
 avoid the cattle trampling the grass  
 before it is cropped which could cost 
 a 20% loss of grass.                  
   The large farm machinery was kept at
 Kieve Mill and included a Combine     
 Harvester,a potato picker,ploughs, a  
 fertiliser spreader and seed drills.  
   A number of the fields were used for
 growing grass and at this time of year
 (June-July) sileage is cut,baled and  
 bagged,using a round baler,a machine  
 which collected,bundled and tied the  
 cut grass.                            </content>
