		<title>10'West Beer'</title>
		<content> 'West Beer' is a farm with 4 holiday  
 cottages. This week one is empty, it  
 is called 'Acorn' because it is built 
 under an oak tree. There are 3 people 
 who live in the main farmhouse, they  
 are Phillipa and Dick Reynolds and his
 mother, Mrs Reynolds. They keep 9     
 milking goats and sell the milk and   
 cheese locally. They also have 6      
 goat-kids and 3 lambs. They have a    
 dumper truck which they use for       
 transport. There is a playing field   
 for the holiday makers and a large    
 pond containing common carp and       
 rainbow carp. While our house was     
 being rebuilt at 'West Down Farm' we  
 lived at one of the cottages for the  
 winter. I love to go back there now   
 and help Dick around the farm.
