		<title>14THE VILLAGE POSTWOMAN</title>
		<content> Being a village postwoman I don't get 
 the variety of jobs that my           
 contempories in the big offices do.My 
 job is just on the delivery side.I    
 start at 6.30am when the mail arrives 
 at the Post Office, brought by the    
 postman in a van, as he goes through  
 to West Meon.I sort the letters into  
 order then deliver them and any       
 parcels around the village.Delivering 
 in the village is easy as it is fairly
 flat.Delivering to the outlying houses
 however is a different matter as the  
 ground is rough, hilly and very       
 treacherous in the winter.I finish at 
 approx: 10.15am then it is back home  
 for a welcome cuppa.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
