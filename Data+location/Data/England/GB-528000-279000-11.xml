		<title>11WOOD FARM, WARBOYS - HISTORY</title>
		<content> The farm is more than 200 years old   
 ,and the Warboys railway line used to 
 run through the middle of the         
 farm.The railway that used to run     
 through the farm was the Ramsey       
 to Somersham line. Where one of       
 the old bridges is standing ,Mr.      
 Woodward has let it grow wild.They had
 to knock down a few of the farm       
 buildings to make room for the railway
 line but they rebuilt them somewhere  
 else in the farm including a          
 horse-keepers house which still stands
 today.During the last war the farm    
 was used for grazing and then it was  
 ploughed up and used for potatoes and 
 sugar-beet. Then they found it wasn't 
 very good to grow sugar-beet and      
 potatoes,so they started to grow      
 arable crops like wheat and barley.   
 The farm is owned by Mr. John Woodward
 who has owned it for fifteen years.   </content>
