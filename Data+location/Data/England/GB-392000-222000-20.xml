		<content>  "BRITAIN IN BLOOM" COMPETITION       
                                       
  A town of many attractive{parks,   } 
{gardens}and open spaces, Cheltenham   
 was runner-up to Bath in the "Britain 
 in Bloom" competition in 1984. Local  
 traders, businesses and householders  
 are encouraged to make gardens,       
 terraces and window boxes colourful.  
  The Borough Council Parks Department 
 produce and plant 100,000{flowers}and 
 shrubs by June. A further 50,000      
 plants are kept in reserve to replace 
 those vandalised.  Surplus plants are 
 sold to the public to defray the      
 annual expense.                       
  Throughout the year all main roads   
 into Cheltenham reflect the dedicated 
 efforts of this Department. The town  
 has high hopes of capturing  first    
 place in this year's competition.
