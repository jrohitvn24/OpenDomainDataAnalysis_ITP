		<title>03PURLEY TO PANGBOURNE WALK</title>
		<content>       Walking from Mapledurham Lock to
 Whitchurch Toll Bridge was an         
 interesting and exciting experience   
 for a class from the local Long Lane  
 Primary School.The mill could be seen 
 across the river from the lock but the
 walkway above the weir is incomplete  
 and so the mill cannot be reached on  
 foot.We saw Herons,Swifts,Swallows,   
 Mallards,Coots,Grebes,Canada Geese and
 Swans.On the lock it says,"London 78.5
 miles," and "Oxford 33 miles".We saw  
 Hardwick House across the river and   
 horses in the stud farm but there is  
 very little other building to disturb 
 the view.People on boats waved to us  
 as they passed coming to and from the 
 marina at Purley.Back at school we    
 soon realised how much scope for      
 nature study is right "on our         
 doorstep".
