		<title>06SHOPPING AND EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content>    As this is a rural area, the local 
 people have to{travel out of the area 
 for shops, schools and often work.    
 Most of them depend on road transport,
 mainly private cars, despite the rail 
 and bus services.                     
    There are{no shops}within the      
 survey area except for a Newsagent's  
 shop within the airport building. As a
 result even daily items have to be    
 bought in the local villages or nearby
 towns.                                
    The farms employ few additional    
 workers,often only one person and even
 then mostly part-time. The only other 
 permanent employment is at the        
 chemical works, the airport or at the 
 many new uses of the RAF buildings    
 within the airport grounds. These     
 attract{many workers from outside the 
{survey area.
