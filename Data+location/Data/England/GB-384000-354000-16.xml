		<content>    Mrs. H. Tootle was born in 1941.She
works at present at Dove Bank Primary  
and also attended the school as a      
pupil.What changes has she seen?       
    The school now used was started in 
1974, a few metres from the old site   
which is alongside the graveyard.      
    Mrs.Tootle began teaching in the   
old building in 1970. The old school   
had seven classes like the present one 
but they were bigger with wooden       
floors.                                
    As a pupil,she remembers the       
teachers coming to school on bikes.    
There was no made road leading to the  
school,only a dirt track.She disliked  
the cows in the surrounding fields!    
    Things have changed: then there was
no swimming or outings. Boys and girls 
had separate playgrounds.
