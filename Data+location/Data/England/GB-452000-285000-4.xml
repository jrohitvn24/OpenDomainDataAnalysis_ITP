		<title>04CAULDWELL FARM, BITTESWELL</title>
		<content>   My granny and grandpa bought our    
 farm in August 1955. It cost Â£9,250   
 with 149 acres, 16 buildings          
 (including the house) and sheep dip.  
 They brought with them their milking  
 herd, and then bought some sheep.     
   When they bought the farm they had a
 garden with a vegetable patch, a path 
 through the middle and an outside     
 toilet. We had five buildings and one 
 of them was the biggest in the        
 district at the time. We have two     
 yards,one cobbled and the other       
 concreted.                            
   In one field we have got a spring.  
 We have two wells, one in the house   
 and one in the cobbled yard. There is 
 a bog in one of our fields. Our fields
 are nearly all grass, but we have a   
 lot of barley, wheat and potatoes.
