		<title>01STOCK GREEN AND AREA</title>
		<content> The area is mainly flat and low lying 
 agricultural land. The farm land is   
 mainly used for cattle and sheep      
 grazing, horse breeding and cereal    
 crops. There are two villages, Bradley
 Green in the north and Stock Green in 
 the centre of the area with the Bow   
 Brook running east to west between    
 them. The southern section of the area
 has several woods, the largest being  
 roundhill wood. several minor roads   
 cross the area. The majority of the   
 villagers commute to the large centres
 of Redditch and Birmingham, the others
 being mainly employed in the          
 agricultural industry. The area is    
 immediately south of a roman road     
 which was a "salt route".
