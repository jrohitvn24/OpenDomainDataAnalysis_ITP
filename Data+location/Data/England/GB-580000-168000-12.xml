		<content>The main channel of the River Medway   
in Long Reach and Pinup Reach occupies 
the north and west portions of this    
block. While it is a fairly busy       
commercial waterway serving the docks  
of Gillingham and Rochester,it is also 
an important recreational resource.    
The deep wwater of the main channel    
means that large yachts with deep      
keels can use the river. On summer     
weekends the river is dotted with      
sails. Fast deep keel yachts built     
and rigged specially for racing such   
as Dragons and J class compete         
regularly. With their colourfull       
spinnaker sails they make a thrilling  
spectacle from a vantage point such    
as Darnet Fort. Alternatively tidal    
creeks such as Bartlett Creek provide  
sheltered waters where bilge keel      
vessels can anchor and spend a night.  
Creeks also provide safe water skiing. </content>
