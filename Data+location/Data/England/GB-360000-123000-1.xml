		<content> Westward the landscape is a pattern f 
 well farmed fields with grass for     
 dairy farming predominating. At the   
 eastern end the land rises to the     
 ancient hill fort known locally as    
 Cadbury Castle but by the media and   
 tourism as Camelot. This interesting  
 monument brings many tourists from    
 home and abroad to this otherwise     
 peaceful area of farms and small      
 villages. Tourists have little effect 
 on village life as there are no shops 
 or museums to cater for them. Local   
 children have to be taken by bus to   
 schools in their parts of Somerset as 
 local schools are closed. There are   
 plans to allow fare paying public to  
 travel on these buses. South Cadbury  
 has a new pavillion built on its      
 playing field but activities such as  
 the village site still take place as  
 traditionally,                        </content>
