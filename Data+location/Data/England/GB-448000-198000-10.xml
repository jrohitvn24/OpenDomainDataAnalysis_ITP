		<title>10Radley College, Abingdon</title>
		<content>Radley College was opened in 1847 by   
William Sewell who wanted to provide a 
school where boys would receive a      
liberal education.Because William      
was an Oxford Don,Radley College is    
modelled on the University.The staff   
are called Dons,the pupils wear gowns  
and the dining hall is arranged like   
a refectory in an Oxford College.      
Radley College is a boys'public        
school, not a state school.This        
means it is a fee paying and           
boarding school.There are 55 full time 
staff and upto 20 part time staff. The 
600 pupils,aged between 13 and 18,come 
from many countries and all have to    
pass the Common Entrance Exam to       
ensure their academic ability.The      
General School Fee is 1,645 pounds per 
term.Various Scholarships and          
Exhibitions allow upto 20 pupils to be 
assisted with fees each year.          </content>
