		<title>03A Typical Saturday.</title>
		<content>    On Saturday I get up quite early at
 about 8.30a.m.I have my breakfast and 
 watch the Saturday morning programmes.
    At about 10.30a.m. I walk into town
 to meet my friend Sarah.We have a look
 around town and have our dinner in    
 MacDonald's.In town we like to have a 
 go on the computers in Boots or John  
 Menzies.                              
   We like to have a look in the       
 clothes' shops, the make-up shops and 
 the shoe shops. We both go home on the
 bus between 4.00 p.m. and 5.00 p.m.   
   When I get home I have my tea       
 watching television . Later on I wash 
 the dishes for my mum and I practise  
 my violin for 30 minutes.             
   When it's time for Dynasty I watch  
 it and later I watch Hill Street      
 Blues.Then I go to bed.               
                                       
                                       </content>
