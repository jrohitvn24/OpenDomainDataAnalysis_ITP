 building the Midland Railway, for clay
 deposits suitable for{brickmaking}were
 found.{Clay}was dug for one hundred   
 years and a large hole left. The      
 government regulations insist that the
 land is returned to its original state
 so local firms are bringing in their  
{rubble}and{dumping}it at a cost of    
 Â£6.55. Household{rubbish}is not       
 allowed because of the smell. The area
 is going to be landscaped and left for
 cattle to graze. In fifty years time  
 the land will be suitable for building
 on. When they were building the       
 railway they found the bones of a man 
 and a horse. They did not find the    
 clothes for the man so they believed  
 that he was murdered during the Civil 
 War. It is also planned to study an   
{Anglo Saxon}cemetery which was        
 discovered in 1939.                   </content>
