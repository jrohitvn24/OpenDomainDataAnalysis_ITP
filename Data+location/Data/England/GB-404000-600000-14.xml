		<title>14Games We Play</title>
		<content> At our school, children in the first  
 year play "Hopscotch," "What time is  
 it Mr Wolf" and "Leapfrog." The fourth
 year girls also play "Hopscotch" but  
 the boys do not take part.They play   
 basketball, football or throw a tennis
 ball around in teams.                 
 To play "What time is it Mr Wolf" you 
 need someone to be "Wolf" at the top  
 end of the yard. He turns his back on 
 them and they keep asking the time as 
 they walk towards him, stepping out   
 the number he has said. When he turns 
 around they have not to let him see   
 them moving otherwise they are out.   
 The first person to touch him on the  
 back then becomes "Wolf."             
 Sometimes the "Wolf" will chase after 
 us once he is touched on the back and 
 has to try to catch one of us before  
 we get back to safety.
