		<content>  There are 25 public footpaths running
 through our area. The County Council  
 numbers and signposts the paths with  
 the aid of the Ramblers Association.  
 The Speldhurst Parish Footpaths Group 
 checks that paths are maintained by   
 the landowners.                       
  Many paths are simply short cuts     
 between various places but some       
 stretch right across our area.        
  One path, Bridleway 111, used to be  
 a packhorse route and may have been a 
 smugglers path from the coast to      
 London. It enters our block at grid   
 ref. 05550138 and runs up a wooded    
 ravine. From the bottom of Barrow Lane
 over Holmewood Ridge to the cemetry at
 the end of Farnham Lane the old path  
 has been replaced by a modern road. At
 the cemetry it becomes a woodland path
 once more.The path,heading for London,
 leaves the area at grid ref. 05580410.</content>
