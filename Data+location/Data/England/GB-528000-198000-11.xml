		<content> Glasgow Stud in Burnt Farm Ride,      
 occupies 176 acres, comprising 20     
 acres of woodland, 6 acres of building
 land, 80 acres of arable and 70 acres 
 of pasture.The Stud was established in
 1824 for hunting at Theobalds Estate. 
 Bloodstock was kept until 10 years    
 ago, when they went to Newmarket.There
 have been some interesting owners and 
 horses, including Milrieffe.Now, there
 are 60 horses, some bred at the Stud, 
 kept for events and riding.Horses     
 start work at 3 yeaars, and when too  
 old are put out to grass.Stabling     
 costs from Â£42 for livery to Â£12 for  
 D.I.Y. 10 girls and 3 men work        
 there.The stud grows some of its own  
 hay, straw and corn.The land is       
 crossed by a road, and a public foot- 
 path.The woodland is home for badgers,
 rabbits, foxes and deer.
