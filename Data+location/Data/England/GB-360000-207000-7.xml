		<content> The vicar, since 1975, is the Reverend
 Felix Watkins who with his wife Peggy 
 lives in the near by vicarage . As    
 well as the church he looks after a   
 daughter Church in Yorkly assisted by 
 the Reverend George Battan, a non-    
 stipendiary curate .There are 2       
 services and one mid week and ona     
 saturday morning.On average there are 
 40-50 in the congregation sunday      
 mornings.The main event of 1985 has   
 been the complete re-roofing of the   
 Church mainly untouched since it was  
 built in 1822.Because of its unique   
 architecture grants towards the cost  
 have been obtained from Goverment and 
 volutary bodies, but over half has    
 been raised by money raising events in
 the community and from money loaned by
 parishioners.The total cost of the    
 repairs was Â£18,500 and took 4 months 
 to complete.                          </content>
