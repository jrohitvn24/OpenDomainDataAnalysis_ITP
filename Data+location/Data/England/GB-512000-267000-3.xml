		<title>03Grafham Reservoir.</title>
		<content>   The ideas to make{Grafham reservoir}
 were initiated in 1958, when it became
 apparent that a number of separate    
 water authorities were intending to   
 abstract water from the Great Ouse to 
 provide for a rapidly expanding       
 population.                           
   Much care was taken in selecting the
 correct site and this particular area 
 was found to be ideal: there already  
 was a natural valley formed by the    
 Diddington Brook because of an        
 impervious layer of chalky boulder    
 clay beneath which stretches a deep   
 and continuous mantle of grey Oxford  
 clay.                                 
   The preparations were long and      
 careful.Every cottage and barn was    
 removed, every tree felled to ensure  
 that when fishing and water sports    
 were possible, there could be no      
 hidden hazards.                       </content>
