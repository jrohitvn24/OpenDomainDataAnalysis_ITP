		<title>16MY HOME LIFE AT WEEKENDS</title>
		<content> On Saturday, the family wake up a     
 little later than the rest of the week
 when we have to go to work or school. 
 During breakfast, I usually watch the 
 children's programmes on television,  
 while my brother plays computer games.
 Most Saturdays we go to town as a     
 family to buy food from the Asda      
 Supermarket which has been open for a 
 few years and where, as our survey    
 showed, many Hartpury people buy their
 groceries. Then we usually buy clothes
 and other items from the Shopping     
 Centre. When we arrive home we play in
 the garden while dad tends to the     
 gardening. In the afternoon, we travel
 by car to places of interest in the   
 Forest of Dean or the Cotswolds. We   
 spend our evenings watching television
 or reading books.
