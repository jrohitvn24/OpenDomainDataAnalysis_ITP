		<content> Sunnyside Primary School was built in 
 Coulby Newham in 1978. It was the     
 first purpose built primary school    
 integrating children with{special     
{needs}into ordinary school. The school
 has children who are partially        
 sighted, partially hearing, E.S.N. and
 physically handicapped who are taught 
 in normal classes as much as possible.
 There is also an{adjustment unit}where
 children with behaviour problems can  
 be withdrawn from other schools. The  
 building is{open plan}and built around
 courtyards and has small quiet rooms  
 for group work. There is a coffee bar 
 as the school is also used as a       
{community centre.}Near to Sunnyside is
 Coulby Newham Secondary School. When a
 pupil reaches the age of 11 he or she 
 moves to that school but children with
 special needs may stay on an extra    
 year at Sunnyside.                    </content>
