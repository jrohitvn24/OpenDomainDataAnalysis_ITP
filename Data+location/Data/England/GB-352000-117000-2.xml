		<content>   The northern edge of Yeovil is      
 marked by an escarpment,which rises   
 from the original 'wetlands' of       
 Somerset,drained in the 18th and the  
 20th century to provide good Farmland.
  On the highland stands the town of   
 Yeovil,and our block included the     
 northern part of the town.Most of this
 area is housing-mainly privately owned
 but with one large Council estate.    
 There is a considerable area devoted  
 to recreation with the{Johnson Park},{
{Mudford Recreation Ground}and School  
 and College playing fields.There is   
 some light industry in the northern   
 part of the town and a fairly good Bus
 service to the centre.                
   The following accounts were written 
 by second and third year pupils at{   
{WESTFIELD COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL}.
