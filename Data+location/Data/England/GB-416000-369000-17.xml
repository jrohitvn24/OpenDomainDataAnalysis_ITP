		<content> The Parish Church stands in the centre
 of the village and is open every day  
 for prayer and visitors.On Sunday     
 there is the Parish Communion at 10   
 o'clock which is well attended by     
 people of all ages _ grannies of      
 nearly 90 and small babies.We meet    
 after the Service for coffee are happy
 that newcomers find our church a warm 
 and welcoming place.The also comment  
 on its cleanliness and beautiful      
 kneelers. Baptisms take place during  
 the Sunday Service and from time to   
 time there are weddings and funerals. 
 Many people appreciate the bookstall  
 which guides of the building and of   
 the parishes of Ashford Sheldon.      
 The bells ring every Sunday to        
 welcome us to the Altar.Our Church is 
 truly alive in 1985.
