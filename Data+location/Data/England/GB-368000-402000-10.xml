		<title>10PEEL CHURCH IN LITTLE HULTON</title>
		<content>    The{Kenyon family}(local gentry)   
 provided the resources for the church 
 to be built in 1876 to serve the needs
 of a small rural and mining community.
 Now, the{Reverend Bull}serves a parish
 containing over 22,000 people. After  
 gaining a degree Rev.Bull did further 
 training at theological college before
 becoming a vicar in 1977.             
    The Sunday morning congregation of 
 170 people consists mainly of middle  
 aged people,  though the vicar is     
 trying hard to attract more teenagers.
 Many people it seems want their       
 children baptized{but do}not want     
 the commitment of attending church    
 regularly.   People attending church  
 service is greater now than the       
 1960/70's.  The vicar believes more   
 people  are  realizing that material  
 existence  is  not  everything  and   
 turn   to   the   church   to         </content>
