		<title>14OLD WINDSOR LOCK</title>
		<content> On June 28th 1985 we spent a  morning 
 at Old Windsor Lock.The lock-keeper   
 and his assistant were busy all       
 morning opening and closing the lock  
 for a stream of boats, rivers cruisers
 with parties of school children,small 
 boats called Taurus, Lady Pamela,     
 Wye-Kare,Vivacity,carried holiday-    
 makers.  The lock-keepers house stands
 on an island in the middle of the     
 river,locally called Lock Island. A   
 flood tide mark is fixed on the side  
 of the house from the last flood in   
 1942.The lock gates can be operated by
 river travellers very early in the    
 morning or late at night.Steps are cut
 into each side of the lock.It is 179  
 feet long and 24 feet wide.  On the   
 bank was the patrol boat called "Echo"
 used by the Thames Survey Team to     
 examine the banks and bottom of the   
 Thames for damage. by Sonia and Alex  </content>
