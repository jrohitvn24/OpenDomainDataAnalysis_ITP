		<title>07CHANGES IN LITTLE HORKESLEY</title>
		<content> Mrs Gladys Leach moved to Little      
 Horkesley in 1950 and in that 35 years
 has seen quite a few changes.She      
 started working in 1950 at Lower Dairy
 House,owned by Mr&amp;Mrs Warburton,as a  
 cook.She earned Â£1.00 a week and got  
 her keep.                             
  Farm workers still worked a long day 
 in the 50's and Shire horses were     
 used.Now farms are fully mechanised   
 and only one or two men are needed to 
 do the work.                          
  There was a grocery shop in          
 Lt.Horkesley but a few years ago it   
 was closed down,people have to shop in
 Colchester now.Bicycle were used a    
 great deal for transport but now most 
 people own cars.Norfolks,a local bus  
 company,have run buses from Lt.       
 Horkesley to Colchester for a number  
 of years but now there is only one bus
 a day.                                </content>
