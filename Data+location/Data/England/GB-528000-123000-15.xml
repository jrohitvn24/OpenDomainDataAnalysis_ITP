		<content>  66% of people interviewed read a     
 national daily newspaper. The least   
 read was the local daily 'Evening     
 Argus' because people prefer to read  
 newspapers in the morning and local   
 news in this paper is mainly about    
 Brighton and other large towns. 33%   
 read the 'Mid Sussex Times', the local
 weekly printed in nearby Haywards     
 Heath. There are also 3 free          
 advertising newspapers. One half of   
 the people have papers delivered.     
  Nearly every household has a         
 television set. Adults prefer to watch
 BBC, children ITV.                    
  Only 15% of people interviewed       
 listen to local radio: Southern Sound 
 or Radio Sussex both of which are     
 based in Brighton, 17 miles away.     
 Children prefer to listen to BBC Radio
 1 whilst Radio 4 is more popular with 
 adults.                               </content>
