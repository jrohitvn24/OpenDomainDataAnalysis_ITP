   {Housing}There is a great diversity 
 of buildings in and around            
 Robertsbridge ranging from several    
 large period residences to post war   
 council houses.                       
  { Local History}Some of the buildings
 especially in Northbridge St.are      
 evidence that Robertsbridge enjoyed a 
 certain prosperity up to the 16th     
 century.Later rebuilding,destruction  
 and division of buildings indicate a  
 decline in wealth.                    
  { Economics}The railway station with 
 its direct line to London has         
 attracted commuters to the area and   
 encouraged modern house building and  
 raised house prices.                  
   {Social Concerns}The A21 runs       
 through the village and with it brings
 heavy traffic through the narrow road 
 in the centre of the village.         </content>
