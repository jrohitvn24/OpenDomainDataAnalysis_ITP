		<title>16Shopping-South Washington.</title>
		<content>  {The villages of Washington}all have 
 their own{shopping areas.}Ayton is    
 typical of one of these centres.      
{Marie Smith reports:-}                
   There are three different kinds of  
 shops.The V.G has most of the food and
 drink that we like.The newsagent has  
 papers,wool,comics,pop and toys.Next  
 is a take-away selling Chinese food   
 and fish'n'chips.If the things we need
 are not there we go to the town centre
 to{The Galleries.}Here they sell      
 furniture,clothes,and shoes.There are 
 hairdressers,chemists,jewellers and   
 cafes.To get to The Galleries is a    
 five minute bus ride.If you were old  
 you might buy all your things from the
 local shops but The Galleries are     
 cheaper and better.In a little shop   
 you have to put on higher prices so   
 that you can buy more stock. The      
 Galleries also have a better choice.  </content>
