 school dinners but it is not in use   
 any more.Our school has oil fired     
 central heating. The people who work  
 here are 2 full time teachers, 1 part 
 time teacher,2 dinner ladies, 1

 By the side of the school is a public

 under cover area. The field is used   
 for athletics and football and games.
