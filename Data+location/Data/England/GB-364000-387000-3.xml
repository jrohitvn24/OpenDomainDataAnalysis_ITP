		<title>03THE MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL</title>
		<content>   The canal takes ocean-going ships   
 from the{River Mersey}at Liverpool,   
 through the Cheshire countryside, to  
 the inland docks at Manchester.       
                                       
   It is a wide, man-made waterway     
 dating back to the end of the 19th    
 century. In our area you can walk     
 right up to the canal. A little to the
 West this is impossible since the     
 canal is tidal and flows in a deep    
 cutting.                              
                                       
   There were two{ferries}at one time  
 but now only one remains at Thelwall. 
                                       
   It seems that very soon the canal is
 to close. Many people will lose their 
 jobs when this happens but in recent  
 years trade through the canal has     
 dropped making it uneconomical.
