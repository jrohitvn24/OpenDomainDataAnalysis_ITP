		<content> Employment is strongly influenced by  
 the rural surroundings, those working 
 in it, or those who wish to return to 
 its tranquility after working in town.
 A large number of houses have small   
 holdings attached. These are commonly 
 used for horses or turned into        
 alottments for personal use or for    
 neighbours to rent. The majority of   
 people work in the surrounding        
 villages or towns and some commute to 
{London }via the{M4}or by train from   
{Reading.}Local occupations include    
{publicans, gardeners, farm workers}or 
{farmers, milk rounds, gamekeepers,    
{building and maintenance contractors  
 and{garage mechanics.}The more        
 professional occupations in the area  
 include{commercial air line pilots,   
 two{M.Ps}(one local and the other of a
 constituency in Lincolnshire ), and a 
{deputy editor}of a Fleet St paper.    </content>
