		<title>03CLACTON PIER</title>
		<content> Clacton Pier is about 1 mile long. It 
 is Â£3 to  go on the pier and 30 pence 
 to walk on it. There are lots of fun  
 packed amusements on the pier. When   
 the rollercoaster first came it was a 
 great attraction to lots of people.But
 unfortunately they had to take down   
 the helterskelter. On the 21st. June  
 1985 the killer whale was taken off   
 the pier it went to Windsor Safari    
 Park where the pool is much bigger.   
 They are soon putting a pool where the
 killer whale was, with a big water    
 slide and juccuzi, and taking the sea 
 lion away. At night on the pier, there
 is a Disco called Oscars. There is    
 also a big wheel, speedway, umbrellas 
 and lots more rides. It is open daily 
 from 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock. The Ice 
 skating is on the pier in the winter. 
 All in all, well worth a visit!
