		<title>10CUB SCOUTS</title>
		<content> For a few weeks we see if we like it  
 and then we are invested, that means  
 we become a Cub Scout. About twice a  
 year we go camping. At the meetings we
 play games like "Pip,squeakand Wilfred
 To play it everyone sits in a circle  
 and Arkala goes round tapping each    
 person on the head saying Pip,Squeak  
 and Wilfred until all the circle was  
 done. Then Arkala calls out "Wilfred".
 All the boys whose heads were tapped  
 when she said "Wilfred" run like mad  
 round the circle. When she calls out  
 "home" everyone runs back to where    
 they started.We do an athlete,camping,
 cycling,swimming and many other       
 badges. We went to Blackwell Court for
 our camping badge. We take part in    
 Gang Shows and Christmas concerts also
 we run Fetes,Jumble Sales and Bazaars 
 to raise funds for our pack or for    
 charities.                            </content>
