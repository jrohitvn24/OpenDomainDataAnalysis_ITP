		<title>06A newcomer to Sandwich.</title>
		<content>   We moved to Sandwich in August 1984.
It seemed like an interesting town with
many characteristics. The first thing  
that we bought here was a sixteen foot 
cruising boat. We had always wanted a  
boat, and living near the River Stour  
meant that we had the chance to have   
one.                                   
   We had moved into the R.A.F. married
quarters near the industrial estate,   
and thought that this would mean that  
we would not have much traffic. We soon
found this was not so and lorries drove
past at all hours. It did have its good
points though, it was near to Stonar   
Lake. If we join the Sandwich Sailing  
and Motor Boat Club then we can take   
our dinghy out on the lake and go to   
parties in the clubhouse. Also living  
near to the mooring means we don't have
to go all the way across town to get to
it. Our house is alright for our needs.</content>
