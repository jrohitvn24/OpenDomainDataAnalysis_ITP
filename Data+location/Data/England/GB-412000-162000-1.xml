 The area is dominated by the southern 
 chalk scarp of the Marlborough Downs, 
 which overlooks the Vale of Pewsey.   
 This ridge acts as a watershed between
 the Rivers Kennet to the North and    
 Avon to the South.                    
    The higher points of the scarp are 
 wrinkled with embankments and         
 earthworks of iron-age settlements and
 afford fine views to the South.  The  
 whole area is intensively farmed,     
 though there are substantial numbers  
 of hedgerow-trees and copses below the
 scarp.                                
    There are only two settlements in  
 the area; the small village of Oare   
 (Pop.230) and the hamlet of Huish     
 (Pop. 36). The remaining sparse       
 population is in scattered farm       
 settlements.                          
                                       </content>
