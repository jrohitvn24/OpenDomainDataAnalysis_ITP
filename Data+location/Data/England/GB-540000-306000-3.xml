 P.T.A.- The Wisbech St. Mary P.T.A.   
 was formed in the late l950's and has 
 been an extremely active organisation 
 ever since. It's main function has    
 been to raise funds to be used for the
 benefit of the school and it's pupils.
 Recently the P.T.A. has attempted to  
 establish the Summer Fair as a major  
 village event including, fun-run,     
 parade of floats and dog show.        
 Over the last five years the Bonfire  
 and Firework Display has become a     
 major area event attracting upwards of
 2,000 people.                         
 These and other smaller events have   
 enabled the school to be supported to 
 the tune of at least Â£2,000 per year.
