		<content>   The river Skerne follows an         
 'L'-shaped course through the area,   
 draining the wet and marshy land to   
 the east of the village.              
   One particular field has the unusual
 feature of four rivulets rising in it 
 and flowing in four different         
 directions. One writer observed       
 "Pity that such a singular close      
 does not exist in the East.There      
 it would have established in the East.
 There it would have established the   
 fame of some geographical speculator  
 and fixed the site of Eden at once."  
   The river Skerne did also encourage 
 economic activity in the area. In 1857
 not only was a water corn mill in     
 operation  but a shoe-thread          
 manufactory employing some 60 work    
 people.
