		<content> Sutton Manor is the local colliery    
 found towards the eastern  border of  
 the block. Relatively few coal-mining 
 families are found in the Rainhill    
 area, however. The following account  
 comes from the son of a coal miner.   
 About 950 people work at Sutton Manor 
 and it produces about 657,000 tonnes  
 of coal a year. About Â£17 millions    
 will be invested in the pit over the  
 next few years. The method by which   
 coal is raised is being modernised,   
 the existing cage with two decks, each
 holding two trucks, is being replaced 
 by one cage with a large skip. This   
 will eliminate the problem of coal    
 being stored at the pit bottom because
 it cannot be raised quickly enough.   
 Winches, which are now steam driven,  
 are being replaced by electric        
 winders.                              
 The pit is rich in methane gas. This  </content>
