		<content> The people in Langtree today wear     
 mostly Jeans(a style of trousers),    
 T-shirts,baggy jumpers and trainer    
 shoes. If it is hot girls wear skirts 
 and T-shirts or shorts and T-shirts.  
 The shoes are usually black, grey or  
 red and flat.The hair is mostly       
 flicked and shortish. Cardigans are   
 becoming more popular again.          
                                       
 My favourite game is Hide-and-seek. I 
 like it because if you don't find a   
 place to hide in 100 seconds you are  
 a seeker. I play it a lot. I have     
 another favourite game which is catch.
 I like this game because I am quite a 
 fast runner. I play this at home and  
 at school.
