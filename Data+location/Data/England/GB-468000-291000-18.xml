    The following survey conducted in  
 Kibworth Beauchamp in June 1985 showed
 a very wide range of hobbies and      
 interests pursued by people of all    
 ages.A total of 136 seperate          
 activities were given by those        
 questioned.                           
   The most popular recreational       
 activity was gardening, closely       
 followed by reading and knitting.     
 Swimming, sewing and travel were next 
 in order. Tennis and badminton were   
 the most popular organised sports     
 followed by football and golf. Walking
 and cooking were equal in popularity  
 as were horse riding and squash. Next 
 in order came cycling, darts and      
 dancing. Photography, music and       
 painting again were approximately     
 equal.
