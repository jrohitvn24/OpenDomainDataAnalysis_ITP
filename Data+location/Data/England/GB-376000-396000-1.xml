		<content> This area is cut by the Manchester    
 Ship Canal and the Bridgewater Canal. 
 To the south is Trafford Park, once   
 the most famous industrial estate in  
 Europe. Since the Second World War the
 area has declined.                    
 Nowadays the estate is being replanned
 and rebuilt with new roads and a      
 change to modern industry, including  
 newspaper printing (The Daily         
 Telegraph), all focussing on the M63  
 instead of the railway and the canal. 
 In the southeast corner, there is a   
 small area of housing, shops and      
 schools built to cater for estate     
 workers. North of the canal there is  
 dense industrial housing which        
 includes the ancient settlement of    
 Eccles and its nineteenth century     
 industrial off-shoot, Patricroft.     
 Here, derelict housing is being       
 replaced by new housing.              </content>
