		<content> There is one shop,a garage and six    
 public houses in our grid no other    
 industry exists in our village,so     
 everyone has to travel out to work.   
 Most people go into Swindon or the    
 nearby industrial estates,but because 
 we are nearthe M4 some go much        
 further.We did a survey,three fathers 
 travelled everywhere,two went to      
 London,two to Newbury,one to          
 Reading,one to Marlborough,one to     
 Faringdon,one to Watchfield and one to
 Oxford.                               
 The main places of work in Swindon are
 Allied Dunbar,an insurance firm,Burmah

 company,several computer companies    
 Intel,Logica and Koda,The Railways and
 the Post Office.
