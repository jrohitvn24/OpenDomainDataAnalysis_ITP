		<content>  The Lollipop Lady sees me across the 
road &amp; I play in the playground until  
the bell goes, then I line up &amp; go into
class. We only go to school from Monday
to Friday. Sometimes we have holidays &amp;
we don't go to school at all. School is
for learning how to read &amp; how to      
write. All children go to school until 
16 years &amp; some stay longer. Our dads &amp;
mums have to pay taxes so the school   
can be opened &amp; run. I like going to   
Guides too. We have to wear a uniform. 
I like animals &amp; the countryside as    
well. I like going for walks outside in
the country. I have a dog as a pet.
