		<content> There used to be a cloth mill         
 that changed to producing bank notes  
 there.The mill was water powered that 
 is why there is a damn there.The damn 
 is surrounded by mixed woodland and   
 farmland,and is in a small valley.The 
 walls of the damn are now in danger of
 collapsing,and is owned by the Water  
 board.The water of the damn runs down 
 a small stream from the moor.In the   
 damn there are Rainbow and Brown      
 trout, there are also Bream and some  
 more common small fish,and they are   
 caught by a fishing club.             
 Around the damn,being mixed           
 woodland,there is a wide variety of   
 wild life,including small animals,    
 dragonflies and alot of bird life.    
 This is an ideal place for family     
 outings and picnics.                  
 Some of the large slabs of stone and  
 foundations of the mill still remain. </content>
