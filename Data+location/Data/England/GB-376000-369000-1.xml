		<title>01GOOSTREY-GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content>    Goostrey is a village of about     
 2000 inhabitants.It is surrounded by  
 the flat farmlands of the Cheshire    
 Plain.                                
   Settlement in the area is mostly in 
 the village with farms occurring at   
 intervals along the minor roads.There 
 is a small settlement at Jodrell Bank 
 close to the radio telescope.The huge 
 bowl of the telescope can be seen for 
 miles around.                         
   Goostrey has a church,a chapel,two  
 public houses,a village hall,a school 
 and a few shops.Many of the villagers 
 are relative newcomers who have moved 
 into houses built in the last fifteen 
 years.In spite of this influx, the    
 village still retains its rural       
 customs such as the Gooseberry Show   
 and the Rose Day.
