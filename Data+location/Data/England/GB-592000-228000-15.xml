		<content> Fifty years ago many people worked on 
 a farm,but today because of farm      
 machinery,less work on the land and   
 more travel to work in local towns.The
 heavy work was done by{horses}and     
 lighter jobs by hand. The only        
 machines used locally were a          
{self-binder}and a{threshing machine.  
 Farm workers were allowed to snare    
{rabbits}for themselves and were       
 sometimes given free milk, vegetables 
 and eggs.Many workers lived in "tied  
 cottages".This rarely happens today.  
 During the winter, fifty years ago, a 
 man from this area used to cycle to   
 Colchester,buy bloaters, herrings and 
 oranges and exchange them in the      
 village for rabbit skins. Then women  
 worked when needed on the farms       
 picking peas and other vegetables     
 Today some local women work through   
 the year at local egg farms.          </content>
