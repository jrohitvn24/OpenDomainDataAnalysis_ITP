		<title>13Laughton-Peoples' Views</title>
		<content> Last week Nicola and I went out       
 surveying our village. We asked       
 questions about peoples' lives in     
 Laughton. The things that we were     
 trying to find out was about their    
 lives in the village, the things they 
 liked and what they disliked about    
 living here. Everyone we talked to    
 was married and over 21. We also found
 two widows. Nearly everyone said that 
 the area is quiet, and that was the   
 best thing they liked. Sometimes      
 though, they thought that Saturday    
 nights were a bit noisy when the      
 public houses turned out. Then we     
 asked them whether they thought of    
 themselves as newcomers to the        
 village. All of them said "No", except
 one person. The one that thought she  
 was a newcomer said that she was      
 accepted in the village, but we  found
 out that she had lived here 10 years. </content>
