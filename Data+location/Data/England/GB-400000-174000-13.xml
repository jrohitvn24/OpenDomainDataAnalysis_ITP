		<content> The W.I. building is  made of         
 corrugated  metal and is in the centre
 of the village. It has two rooms, a   
 meeting room and a room where the     
 toilet and storage areas are.The      
 building has a little garden outside. 
 The W.I. meets on the second Wednesday
 each month and the annual subscription
 is Â£4. About 30 women are members of  
 the group and the president is Mrs    
 Ruth Allen.                           
 A variety of meetings are organised by
 the group. In February there was a    
 talk about the history of glass and   
 engraving and in March there was a    
 visit to Wiltshire Radio. In June     
 there was a cookery demonstration and 
 in July there  was a visit to a herb  
 garden at Purton Stoke, near Swindon. 
 Apart from meetings the group also    
 organises fund raising and in early   
 June a fete was held.                 </content>
