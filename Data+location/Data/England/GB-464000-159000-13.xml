		<title>13CONSERVATION AREAS</title>
		<content> The areas around the{PARISH CHURCH}and
 at {BRAMLEY GREEN}have been identified
 as having a particular charm resulting
 from the pleasant grouping of older   
 builings with natural landscape       
 features.These areas have been        
 designated as {CONSERVATION AREAS}.   
 There are two conservation areas in{  
{BRAMLEY.}The first has a little bit of
 woodland included in it.It goes from {
{YORK COTTAGE}to{MIDDLE FARM COTTAGE}  
 and down to{HONEY FARM}across to{     
{STREET COTTAGE.}The conservation area 
 is around these farms.                
 The second area is not as large as the
 first.It is mainly composed of {      
{BRAMLEY GREEN},but includes some of   
 the housing around its' perimeter.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
