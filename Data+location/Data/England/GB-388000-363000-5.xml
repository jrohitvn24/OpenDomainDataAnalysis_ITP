		<content> Most of the land in our D block is    
 agricultural.Farming has changed a    
 lot in this century.In the past it    
 was all done by horse because they    
 didn't have modern machinery. The     
 horses pulled ploughs and carts       
 for carrying hay.A lot of men were    
 needed to work on the farm. Often     
 houses were smaller and families      
 quite large.There was no central      
 heating and homes were heated by      
 coal.Most people either worked        
 on farms or down a coal mine.         
 A lot of people today work out        
 of the area in local towns or         
 the Potteries.The average size        
 of a family today is 4 or 5.          
 Most families today own at least      
 one car, however in the past people   
 had to walk or occasionally they had  
 bicycles or horse drawn carts.
