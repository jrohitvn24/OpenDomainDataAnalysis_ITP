   In 1976 the school celebrated its   
 centenary by recreating the atmosphere
 of a Victorian school.A tree was      
 planted in the school field and next  
 to it was buried a time_capsule       
 containing letters,coins and stamps.  
   The original school buildings are   
 still used by the present 92 pupils,4 
 teachers and ancillary staff.An       
 air-raid shelter erected and used     
 during the Second World War is still  
 standing and in use as a store.       
   School Houses are named after Mr.

 "Perambulation of Kent",who lived in  
 Halling during the 16th century and   
 Bishop Gundulph who built the Bishop's
 Palace near the church.               </content>
