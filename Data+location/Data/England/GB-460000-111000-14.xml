		<title>14WOODLAND ECOLOGY</title>
		<content> The Forestry Commission owns 270 acres
 of woodland in the grid area. There is
 proportionately more conifer than     
 hardwood. Bere Forest contains beech, 
 oak, birch, ash and sweet chestnut and
 an indicator of ancient woodland - the
 small leafed lime. About 40 acres is  
 privately owned and Huntbourn Wood    
 (30 acres) has a replanting programme 
 which increases its hardwood content  
 from a quarter to a third. Felling is 
 in progress at Clays Copse and some   
 good quality softwood harvested.      
 Most birds associated with woodlands  
 are found here blackcaps, gold crests,
 chiff-chaffs, willow warblers, green  
 spotted woodpeckers, nightingales,    
 grasshopper warblers,roding woodcocks,
 nightjars &amp; tawny owls. Barn owls are 
 now scarce. Bluebells  growing under  
 the beech trees are a joy in May and  
 there are several varieties of fungi. </content>
