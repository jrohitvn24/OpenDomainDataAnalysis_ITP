		<title>18SURVEY OF FAMILIES</title>
		<content>    Our survey showed that many of the 
 families came to live in Royston quite
 recently.                             
 25% of dads work in Royston.Many dads 
 travel to London,Stevenage and Camb-  
 ridge.                                
    Very few mums and dads were born in
 Royston. Lots of families came from   
 London to live in Royston,and even    
 from as far afield as Scotland,USA and
 Holland.                              
    Over two_thirds of the families do 
 their main weekly shopping in Royton, 
 but some do their main weekly shopping
 in Stevenage and Hitchin.             
    More than half of the families     
 surveyed own one car,although nearly  
 20% of the families own three cars.   
    About 50% of the parents have two  
 children,but a small percentage have  
 more than four children or only a     
 single child.                         </content>
