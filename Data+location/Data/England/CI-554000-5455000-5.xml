 Grosnez Castle is the name of ruins   
 240  feet above sea level in the north
 west corner of Jersey.                
   It occupies, with all the enclosure 
 around it the whole of the actual     
 point of Grosnez. The perimiter wall  
 was about 250 yards long.The Gatehouse
 had a portcullis and a battlemented   
 roof.                                 
                                       
   Grosnez Castle was in ruins by      
 1540 and it is thought that it may    
 have been destroyed deliberately      
 by the  De Carterets (the owners of   
 St.Ouens manor) during the wars       
 of the Roses,they were on the losing  
 side (the White Rose) and so the      
 opposing side, the Red Rose,          
 deliberatly destroyed the Castle.
