 Prince of Wales Park (18.5 acres) and 
 Myrtle Park (27.5 acres). Myrtle Park

 tennis courts and a children's        
 playground. The Bingley Show and      
 Children's Gala are held annually in  
 the park.                             
 Next to the park is the swimming baths

 swimming club caters for all ages.    
 There is a mother and toddle group.   
 there are two municipal golf courses, 
 at Beckfoot and St.Ives, as well as   
 tennis, cricket and rugby clubs.
