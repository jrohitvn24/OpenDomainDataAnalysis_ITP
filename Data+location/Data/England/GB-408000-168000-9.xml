		<content> Most of the work force in the Avebury 
 area is engaged in farm work. Some    
 travel to Swindon as their place of   
 work as office and shopworkers. a few 
 people work at Marlborough, Devizes or
 Calne.                                
 The tourists themselves do not provide
 much in the way of employment in the  
 area as the local villagers are quick 
 to point out. Some employment is      
 provided by the racing stables but    
 because of the nature of the type of  
 work they generally move into the area
 as stable lads and jockeys.
