		<title>19A Farmhouse Kitchen.</title>
		<content>  We visited{White House Farm.}All     
 around the farm was a moat.We went up 
 the drive past lots of flowers.       
                                       
 The door was big with two panels in   
 it and a lion-shaped knocker.The door 
 was opened by the farmer's wife and   
 she  told us to go round to the       
 kitchen.                              
                                       
 In the kitchen there was a range, a   
 table and two dogs.There was an old   
 clock in the corner and there was some
 old china.Around the table there were 
 big ,old chairs.There were stone      
 pitchers and coats-of-arms on the     
 walls.The floor was made of stone.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
