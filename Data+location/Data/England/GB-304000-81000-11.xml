		<title>11Tidwell House near Salterton</title>
		<content> Tidwell House is a delightful georgian
 country house about a mile away from  
 the town centre.It was originally     
 commissioned as a manor house for Lord
 Rolle,a wealthy landowner,in 1725.    
 Mr Simpson now runs the house as an   
 hotel.When he first came to the house 
 it was delapidated.The large apple    
 orchard had over 2000 diseased trees  
 so it had to be cut down.             
 The house contains 21 large rooms all 
 about 17 feet long and 14 feet wide.  
 We asked Mr Simpson whether the house 
 was haunted.He said that he did not   
 know but,in the middle of one night he
 had heard footsteps going up to the   
 roof.He thought it was his son but he 
 was fast asleep and there was nobody  
 else there.There is said to be the    
 ghost of a horse on the top floor and 
 a boy in a brown cloak on the ground  
 floor.The cellars are now a restaurant</content>
