		<content>  There are few farms in{Withybrook}   
 today.Before the War the Village      
 school had about 30 children taught by
{Mrs. Lucas}and the{Headmistress.}They 
 were the children of farm workers.    
 Today there are fewer than 15 children
 of school age and they go by school   
 bus to{Monks Kirby Combined School.   
  Housing in{Withybrook}is expensive   
 because of people moving in to the    
 area to retire.                       
   On{Fridays},a private coach firm,   
{Vanguards of Bulkington},takes        
 shoppers from{Withybrook to Bedworth. 
 There is no public transport in       
{Withybrook}and no shops.              
  There is one inn,"The Pheasant"which 
 attracts people from all over the     
 area.
