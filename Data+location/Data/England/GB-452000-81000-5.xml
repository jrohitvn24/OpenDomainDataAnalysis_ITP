 Godshill is a compact village of      
 approximately 1100 people. The main   
 industry is tourism, there being 5 tea
 gardens, 2 restaurants, 7 gift shops, 
 Herb Cottage, Natural History         
 Museum,Bird Garden - all of thewm     
 echoed in the Model Village in the Old
 Vicarage Gardens. The large car parks 
 barely cope with the enormous numbers 
 of cars and coaches that descend on   
 the village on a summer day. A count  
 at 14.30 on 17.6.85 revealed 130 cars,
 15 coaches, 2 caravans, bringing an   
 estimated 1150 visitors. The village  
 has preserved its old stone cottages -
 many still thatched. Probably the most
 photographed village in England, it   
 appears on jig-saws, calendars,TV     
 etc.But in late Autumn it reverts to  
 its alter ego,a tightly-knit unit     
 full of lively associations.          </content>
