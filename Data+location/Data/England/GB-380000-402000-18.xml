		<title>18PRESTWICH CARNIVAL</title>
		<content> On the third Saturday in June, the    
 people of {Prestwich}line the streets 
 to watch the {Annual Carnival}.Brass  
 bands, dancing troupes, floats,       
 depicting many scenes and crammed with
 children in fancy dress,and carnival  
 queens in beautiful dresses and riding
 on gaily decorated cars wend their way
 through{Prestwich}.                   
 The procession finally arrives at     
{St.Mary's Park},where the newly       
 elected {Carnival Queen}is crowned and
 begins her year of office. It is a    
 very colourful{ceremony}with children 
 carrying out the duties of pages and  
 queen's attendants.Swings,roundabouts 
 and side-shows are a great attraction.
 Lots of money is collected which is   
 then given to local charities.
