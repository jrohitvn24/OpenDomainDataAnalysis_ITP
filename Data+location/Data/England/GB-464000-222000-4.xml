		<title>04CHARNDON,A SMALL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The village once had many facilities. 
 3 years ago the village school closed.
 There used to be a pub called "The Roe
 Buck" but this is now a private house 
 called "The Gables".Approaching the   
 village,one sees a farm with two      
 horses,an old storage barn and a grain
 silo. Nearby is a cottage which is    
 timber framed and used to be thatched.
 There is only one street called "Main 
 Street" with houses on either side.   
 There is also "Middle Farm" with over 
 300 acres and "Valley Farm" where they
 had 2 tractors,1 pony,lambs and       
 cattle.                               
 Half way up Main Street there is a    
 small United Reformed Church and at   
 the end is a recreation ground with   
 swings and a community centre.
