		<content> When we went to interview Mrs. Dawson,
 she told us that where she lives in   
 St.John's Road,trains used to come    
 under her house through the tunnel.   
 The trains do not come under her      
 house any more but the tunnel is still
 there now.They use the tunnel for a   
 shooting range .Mrs. Dawson said that 
 where houses are now were fields.     
 There are still some fields now but   
 they are used for allotments. Mrs     
 Dawson used to work for 20 years in   
 a shop called"The Handy Shop".It is   
 still there now.Near the"Handy Shop"  
 were cottages but now there is a      
 police station and where there were   
  some more cottages is the School of  
 Art. Mrs Dawson said that they had to 
 dig 10 metres down to build the School
 of Art and it was all under water as  
 there is a river near by.
