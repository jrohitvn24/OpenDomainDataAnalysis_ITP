		<title>15Halewood Triangle Park</title>
		<content>   The Halewood Triangle Country Park  
 is owned and managed by Knowsley      
 Borough Council. It is a key area of  
 open countryside lying adjacent to the
 Merseyside conurbation. The former    
 railway land supports a range of      
{wildlife}habitats including ponds,    
 meadows, heaths and woodland, which   
 offer an attractive setting for a     
 variety of countryside activities.    
   The 28 acre park occupies part of   
 the site of a{railway}intersection    
 between the former Cheshire Lines     
 Railway (now disused) and the main    
 Liverpool-Warrington-Manchester line. 
   The Park exhibits a notable         
 diversity of habitats ranging from    
 open water to{grassland}with heath,   
 through open and dense scrub to semi  
 deciduous{woodland.}There are 5{ponds}
 in the park, the largest of which is  
 in the southern area.   P.SWEENEY.    </content>
