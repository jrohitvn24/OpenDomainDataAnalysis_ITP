		<content>{The Major Hospital}provision is at    
 Tameside General Hospital about six   
 miles from the town, but there are{   
{three small local hospitals.}One of   
 these -{Shirehill}- caters for the    
 elderly and offers rehabilitation     
 courses after disabling illness as    
 well as long term care for the infirm 
 and nursing for the terminally ill.   
    The rehabilitation work is based on
 a{day centre}opened in 1985. Here     
 patients receive 1.assessment         
                  2.physiotherapy      
                  3.occupational       
 therapy, relearning skills such as    
 cookery to be able to cope at home.   
 Some of the older people remember     
 Shire Hill as the workhouse and are   
 prejudiced against it.                
   {The Partington Hospital,}once the  
 maternity home, nurses elderly        
 orthopaedic patients.   (cont.p.19)   </content>
