		<title>19AMENITIES IN THE EGMERE AREA</title>
		<content> Amenities in the area are few. The    
 North Norfolk District Council is     
 responsible for the region. They      
 provide the service of emptying septic
 tanks, most premises having modern    
 sanitation. They also provide the     
 weekly refuse collection. Mains water 
 is supplied (through the Anglian Water
 Board). A postal service is ,of       
 course, provided. There is one public 
 telephone. The nearest doctors'       
 surgery is two miles away and the     
 hospital twenty miles. All interviewed
 said that the emergency services gave 
 very good service. Pupils go from     
 Egmere to Walsingham C.P. by taxi or  
 to Wells High School by coach. There  
 are no shops. A mobile library and    
 grocer's van visits Egmere. Milk,     
 bread and coal are delivered to the   
 houses regularly.
