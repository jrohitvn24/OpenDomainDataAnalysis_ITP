		<content>{Causway Head}is three hundred years   
 old and is built from solid stone. The
 people who own the house think that it
 is a cottage, but nobody really knows.
 The building is under conservation, so
 it cannot be altered. The roof is     
 covered with flag stones. The walls   
 are made of solid stone and are 50    
 centimetres thick. The cottage was    
 originally a farm.                    
                                       
 Nearby{Rose Cottage}is very           
 attractive. There is a field next to  
 the cottage and cows from an adjoining
 farm graze there.                     
                                       
 Roads joining the cottages are simply 
 dirt tracks. Little has changed this  
 part of Helmshore Village over the    
 years.
