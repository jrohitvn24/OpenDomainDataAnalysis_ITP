 Many trees have been affected by Dutch
 Elm disease and have been removed.    
 One thousand new trees have recently  
 been planted to replace these.        
 It was felt that the attitude of      
 people toward the patients is         
 generally sympathetic.                
 A Garden Party organised by the       
 Hospital League of Friends is held    
 annually in the Hopital Grounds and in
 1985 raised over Â£900 to be used on   
 amenities and activites for the       
 patients. At the present time there is
 a lot of controversy over whether to  
 close Winestead Hospital but at a     
 recently held annual Garden Party one 
 patient was heard to say to a Hospital
 official, "Don't close this place will
 you, because we like it here and all  
 my friends are here".                 </content>
