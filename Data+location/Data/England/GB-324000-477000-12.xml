		<title>12Farming in Pennington.</title>
		<content> My name is Doreen. I live on          
 Walthwaite farm overlooking the       
 village.Our farm is over 100 years    
 old. My grandad owned our farm first. 
 It is a mixed farm.It has cows,sheep, 
 hens,dogs,cats and two horses that    
 don't work.My mum,dad and me work on  
 the farm.Sometimes a man called Evan  
 comes to help when we are busy.Today I
 got up,dressed and washed and got the 
 cows in.I tied them up and started    
 milking.Then I helped my mum feed the 
 calves then had my breakfast.After    
 that I went on my horse to see my     
 friend.Later I had my dinner,played   
 for a bit. Then we got the cows again 
 and milked them.Later I had my        
 tea,watched tele for half-an-hour and 
 got my nightie on.Next I had a wash   
 and brushed my teeth and went to bed.
