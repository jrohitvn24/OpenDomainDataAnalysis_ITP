 There are many small shopping centres 
 around{Norwich.Earlham House}is about 
 a mile  from the city centre and the  
 shops there include a post office a   
 bread shop an newsagents, a           
 supermarket,a  fish and  chip shops   
 and a  bank.                          
           We questioned some of the   
 shoppers and they told us they came to
 Earlham house because of the free car 
 park. It is also a short walk from    
 shops to shop and for many people the 
 centre is quite close to their homes. 
      We asked if they would like to   
 see any changes or additions to       
 shopping facilities. It seems that a  
 clothing shop would be welcome.
