		<title>07Life in Clifton Today</title>
		<content>   Because of its geographical         
 situation,many of the adult population
 of the village travel into Rugby to   
 find employment.                      
   In our class,4 of our parents worked
 for the various divisions of G.E.C.,8 
 worked for different companies in     
 Rugby and 9 travelled to              
 London,Birmingham,Leicester,Warwick   
 and Coventry.                         
   Only 14 children in the class lived 
 near to their grandparents and 17     
 children had moved into Clifton and   
 had not been born there.              
   Eight children were able to walk to 
 school from their homes,the other 16  
 children either travelled in their    
 parents'cars or came by bus.          
   The school is small but 23 children 
 thought that there were definite      
 advantages in this.
