  There are two trunk roads passing    
 through Barlby:the A19 York-Doncaster 
 and the A63 Leeds-Hull.Both roads are 
 extremely busy with traffic going to  
 and from local factories and mines as 
 well as through traffic.Serious hold- 
 ups occur when the Toll Bridge opens. 
 Most of the people who have moved into
 the new houses have cars so the roads 
 have become even busier.              
  Because there is so much traffic we  
 have a Crossing Patrol outside school 
 to see us safely across the road.The  
 nick-name for the Crossing Patrol is  
 "Lolly-pop man" because of the sign he
 carries.                              
  People in Barlby hope that part of   
 the old Selby to York railway line    
 might be used to make a by-pass to    
 take the traffic round the village.
