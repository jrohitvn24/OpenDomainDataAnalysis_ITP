		<title>03LIFE STYLES IN SHELFORD</title>
		<content> for keeping all the hay and other     
 things dry for the winter.We think    
 that this is the most common life     
 style in Shelford.                    
   A lot of old folk around eighty,or  
 sixty five come to the small village  
 of Shelford after retirement expecting
 a peaceful way of life as there are no
 industrial factories or big car       
 parks or flats,not like the city.Old  
 folks enjoy the summer evenings,      
 walking around the beautiful          
 countryside or lounging about the     
 garden or even improving the          
 garden. The old people also enjoy the 
 small village for it is rarely        
 vandalised. For example, we saw hardly
 any litter at all.                    
   There is only one shop in the       
 village,the post office.Most food is  
 bought in Radcliffe.
