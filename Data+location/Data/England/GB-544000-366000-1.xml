		<title>01Candesby Area</title>
		<content> This is an entirely rural area,       
 intensively cultivated with large     
 fields and scattered farms. Candlesby 
 Hill on the edge of the Wolds         
 dominates the area. Two main roads    
 A1028 and A158 carry heavy holiday    
 coastal traffic in summer but         
 otherwise mostly local services and   
 agricultural vehicles.                
 The Gunby Hall Estate (National Trust)
 and remnants of Scremby  and Candlesby
 Hale estates retain a pleasantly      
 wooded aspect to the A158 and         
 surroundings.Residents of the area    
 commute to nearby small towns to work.
 A few are self employed tradesmen and 
 agricultural workers. Former primary  
 schools at Welton and Candlesby are   
 now Village Halls encouraging more    
 community activity but residents often
 look to larger centres for their      
 shopping and recreation.              </content>
