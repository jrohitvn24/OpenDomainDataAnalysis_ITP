		<content>                                       
  In our area we have an accident black
spot at the junction of the A5 and     
A428.On either sides there is a garage 
and a public house.We asked the        
landlord and the owner of the garage   
some questions.The landlord has lived  
at the halfway house for 2 years.The   
garage man has lived there since       
1957.The history of the crashes goes   
back a long time. The worst crash was  
in 1964 when a lorry of live fish      
tipped over with fish going everywhere 
it killed 3 people from a family.The   
road lay out has been changed at least 
6 times.  The best change is the round 
about which is the one we have now.
