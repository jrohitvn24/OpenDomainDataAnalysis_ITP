		<title>14COLLEGE &amp; TOWN RELATIONS</title>
		<content> Marlborough College, the well-known   
 public school, was started in the     
 1830's for the sons of Anglican       
 clergymen.  Set at one end of the High
 St., it gives the town a lot of its   
 character, as well as boosting the    
 hotel trade.                          
                                       
 There are many links with the town    
 that are mutually beneficial.  The    
 Marlborough Squash Club flourishes in 
 the College squash courts and a       
 recently completed pool provides      
 facilities for town and college alike.
 On Wednesday afternoon several pupils 
 from the college involve themselves in
 social service projects within        
 the town, varying from tending the    
 gardens of the pensioners in          
 Marlborough to helping in the         
 local primary school.
