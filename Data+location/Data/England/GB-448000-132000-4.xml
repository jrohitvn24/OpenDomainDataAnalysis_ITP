 century, when it was mentioned in the 
 Domesday Book. Above the door is the

 called Mr.Hitchcock and it was last   
 used for milking in 1910.

 the lane is the{Fulling Mill}which    
 dates back to 1695 and is at present  
 for sale with offers from Â£350,000.   
 The Conder Company have modern offices
 in the grounds of a{Queen Anne house  
 built in 1750 which was originally a  
 farmhouse. This house was enlarged in 
 1906 by the then owner Mr. Austin, it 
 still has the fireplaces with the     
 original delft tiles. In{King's Worthy
{Village}is the picturesque thatched   
{public house}"Cart and Horses" built  
 in 1540.
