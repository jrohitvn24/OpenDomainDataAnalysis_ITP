		<title>15The Future Development</title>
		<content>   There must be some doubt as to the  
 future of Whitwell with the scheduled 
 closure within ten years of the mine. 
 The Quarry will continue to provide   
 some{local employment,}as will the    
 farms. The several local building     
 firms are also busy, and this possibly
 gives a clue as to the future of the  
 village. Already in Whitwell there has
 been a great deal of recent housing   
 development. The houses that have been
 built, particularly on Hunter's Park, 
 are family size houses, and many have 
 been bought by{commuters.}Increasingly
 it seems that Whitwell is being seen  
 as within reasonable travelling       
 distance of Worksop and Sheffield. An 
 equivalent three bedroomed house in   
 Whitwell would be some ten thousand   
 pounds cheaper than in{Sheffield.     
  It is very likely that the nature of 
 the villages in the grid will change. </content>
