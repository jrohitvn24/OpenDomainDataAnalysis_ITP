		<title>04SEVENTEEN ACRE WOOD</title>
		<content>This area was mainly deciduous woodland
  as the name of the remaining wood    
"Seventeen Acre Wood" suggests. The    
woodland has, over the years, been     
taken over by the farmer and used as   
pasture and now is used for growing    
wheat. The area is quite marshy and so 
a drainage pond has been built. It is  
called Duck Decoy. The reason for the  
name is unknown, but the Estate used   
was originally owned by Sir Robert     
Peel.
