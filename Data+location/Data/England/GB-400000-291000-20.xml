		<title>20Growing Up in West Bromwich</title>
		<content> I live two lives; an Indian girl at   
 home and a black girl with a white    
 mask at home. I suffer cultural and   
 identity crises. When I thought I was 
 a rebellious teenager, my difficulties
 were really manifestations of this.   
 Indian families' are tightly knit.    
 This presents real problems; I am     
 expected to conform to both white and 
 my family's culture. In my confusion I
 am gradually rejecting the medieval   
 aspects of Asian culture. Afterwards I
 again attempt the futile pursuit of   
 compromise. My parents want me to     
 succeed in white society, yet retain  
 my Indian identity. They are asking   
 too much of me.
