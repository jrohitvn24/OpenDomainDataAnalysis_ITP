		<title>11Houses in Hurworth</title>
		<content> Over half the houses in the village   
 have been built since 1961 in large   
 estates.Before this date the village  
 had grown very slowly over hundreds of
 years.The modern estates are Friars   
 Pardon, Emerson Road, Chase, Bacal,   
 and Broseley in Hurworth and the      
 Grange estate in Hurworth Place.I live
 on the Bacal estate at 10 Southfield  
 Close.The Bacal estate consists of    
 Greenfield Close, Westfield Drive,    
 Emery Close, Hornby Close, Southfield 
 Close, Dale Close, Bollyers Close,    
 Brossfield Close, Sycamore Close and  
 Malvern Close.Sometime in the future, 
 houses are going to be built on the   
 Strawfield.The Strawfield separates   
 Emerson Road from the Bacal estate.   
 Also houses are being built at the    
 bottom of the school playground.
