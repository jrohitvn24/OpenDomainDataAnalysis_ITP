		<title>13Shopping in Yeovil.</title>
		<content>         Shopping in Yeovil in 1985 is 
 very boring,because in the town,there 
 are too many shops of the same kind,  
 for example there are lots of clothes 
 shops, shoe shops and jewellers.      
          A  new shopping precinct,the 
 Quedam,was opened in 1985,but it is   
 not much used,perhaps because the     
 shops there are again the same as the 
 shops in the town.Most shoppers shop  
 in the High Street,and not in the     
 Quedam.                               
          Middle Street too,is usually 
 packed full of people and sometimes   
 vocalists come to play music or put on
 small plays.I like the shops that sell
 everything,for example,Denners in the 
 High Street, and Dingles.
