		<content>{The parish church of St.Mary Magdalene
 stands in the centre of the village.  
 It was rebuilt in 1855 only the tower 
 remaining of the original 14th century
 building.This houses a full peal of 8 
 bells which are rung every Sunday.    
 There are two brasses on the north    
 wall of the chancel dating back to    
 1380,and a central chandelier dated   
 1770.Sunday services are at 8a.m. and 
 10.30a.m.,average attendances being   
 approximately 12 at 8 and 40 at 10.30.
 The priest in charge is also an       
 assistant curate at Roffey.The church 
 is surrounded by a churchyard         
 containing many old graves,many of the
 headstones being illegible.There is no
 other place of worship of any         
 denomination in the village of Rusper.
