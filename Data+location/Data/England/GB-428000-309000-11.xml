		<title>11MY DAY BY IAN LEES AGED 11</title>
		<content>  I get up at 7.00am and I turn on     
 Breakfast T.V. My mum makes my        
 breakfast which is a cup of tea and   
 some cereal with some milk. Then I get
 dressed and put my packed lunch,which 
 I have at school,in my bag. Then I put
 on my coat and walk to school. We play
 for a while and go into school at 9.00
  We have registration and assembly.   
 After that we start lessons usually   
 maths and english until dinner time.  
 After lunch I play football until 1.30
 Then we do topic or project,this takes
 us through to home time at 3.30.I walk
 home with my friends and then have tea
 which is usually chips or a hot dinner
  Then I watch T.V. or play football   
 which is my hobby.My favourite T.V.   
 programmes are Top of the Pops,which  
 is pop music, and Grange Hill which is
 about a secondary school.I go to bed  
 at 9.00pm.                            </content>
