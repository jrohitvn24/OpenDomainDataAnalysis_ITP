		<title>14Torbay Aircraft Museum</title>
		<content> Torbay Aircraft Museum is a collection
 of warplanes, helicopters,            
 anti-aircraft guns, uniforms and small
 weapons.                              
 First it showed the Dam Busters,      
 behind a glass cabinet was a model of 
 a Lancaster bomber. It then showed us 
 the effect of a bouncing bomb on a dam
 wall. Then there was a real bouncing  
 bomb.                                 
 There were many uniforms and relics   
 from World War II, as well as World   
 War I.                                
 Outside the Museum were the aeroplanes
 that flew in the Battle of Britain.   
 Many tourists visit the Museum, one   
 of the many tourist attractions to be 
 found in and around Torbay.
