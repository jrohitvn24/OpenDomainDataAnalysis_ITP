		<title>17Retreat Boatyard</title>
		<content> The Retreat Boatyard is on Topsham    
 road, one mile from Topsham. There is 
 nearby a large house called Retreat   
 House but this is not conected now    
 with the boatyard. The site of the    
 boatyard was once used as stables and 
 courtyard for Retreat House. The yard 
 has been working for about 15 years.  
     The company does not build boats  
 but aims to provide a yard where      
 yachts up to 40 feet in length and 10 
 tonnes in wieght can be moored. The   
 yard has facilties for storage,       
 lifting of boats out of the water,    
 fitting ou and repair of glass fibre  
 and wooden boats. A 33 feet yacht     
 currently employs 11 full time and 4  
 part time workers
