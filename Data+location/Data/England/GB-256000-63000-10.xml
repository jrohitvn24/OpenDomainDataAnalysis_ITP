 The name "warren" occurs five times   
 and "burrow" once. This is a reminder 
 that the area uaed to have a thriving 
 rabbit_breeding industry,which grew up
 with the enlargement of the Dockyard  
 in the time of William IV and         
 continued well into this century.     
 In the warrens the rabbits lived in   
 characteristic pillow monds,because   
 the wet,peaty ground was unsuitable   
 for their burrows.                    
 In Brisworthy burrows the tinners'    
 spoil heaps were used in the same way.
 The suffix "_worthy" means farmstead  
 and is included in the names of both  
 the farms.                            
 The large Bronze Age stone circle or  
 ring gives its name to "Ringmoor".    
 "HenTor" is so called because of its  
 resemblance of one of its boulders to 
 a sitting hen.                        </content>
