		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF PADBURY</title>
		<content> In the original Domesday Padbury had  
 a mill. Padbury Mill still exists, now
 as a private house, but it was a mill 
 at the start of the century. The      
 present building dates back several   
 hundred years. The village contains   
 many houses over 200 years old, some  
 over 300. About 20 houses still have  
 thatched roofs. Padbury has changed   
 considerably over the last 10 years.  
 There has been much infilling with new
 houses. Many of the older houses and  
 barns have been refurbished to provide
 luxury homes, most of which are beyond
 the reach of ordinary families who    
 have lived in the village for         
 generations. However, some starter    
 homes have recently been built and    
 there is a council housing estate at  
 one end of the village. A new school  
 has been built and the future of the  
 village seems assured.                </content>
