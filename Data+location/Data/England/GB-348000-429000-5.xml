 In this area there are mainly         
 semi-detatched corporation houses.In  
 one particular area there are a lot of
 bungalows.A lot of new estates have   
 been built with private houses on the 
 site.I live in a corporation house,for
 which we pay rent.It has three        
 bedrooms,a bathroom and a toilet      
 upstairs and a living room and a      
 kitchen downstairs.In the new houses  
 there are fitted kitchens,curtains and
 carpets right through the house,which 
 are all included in the price of the  
 house.The largest houses have four    
 bedrooms,a toilet and a bathroom      
 upstairs and a living room,dining room
 and a kitchen and a toilet downstairs.
