		<title>09FARMING -SOIL IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON }soils do not lend themselves  
 to growing many of the new crops.{    
{PANTON }fields are best suited to     
 growing crops of wheat, barley and    
 oil-seed rape. The problems occurring 
 in growing crops of potatoes and sugar
 beet are that the soil would not be   
 suitable for lifting the crops in the 
 wet autumn months and a quota system  
 already exists for these two crops and
 acreages for growers are controlled by
 the Potato Marketing Board and the    
 British Sugar Corporation.  Livestock 
 enterprises are declining due to the  
 high-cost, high-risk factor of rearing
 and fattening cattle, sheep and pigs  
 and this, combined with new eating    
 patterns and diets, has caused a drop 
 in demand. Most of {PANTON's }farmers 
 are "yeomen of the land" and not      
 wealthy landowners. The cost of farm- 
 land is approx. Â£l7OO-Â£l9OO per acre. </content>
