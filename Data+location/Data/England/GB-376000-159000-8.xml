		<title>08A TYPICAL WEEKDAY</title>
		<content>    I wake at 7:30am and leave the     
 house at 8:15am.The journey of 8 miles
 to my office at Ensleigh on the North 
 side of Bath takes about 20 minutes   
 using my car or motorcycle.The latter 
 is easier and quicker on the busy     
 roads.                                
    I work as a Civil Servant in the   
 Ministry of Defence.We use computers  
 as much as possible but still clerical
 and administrative staff to deal with 
 non routine matters such as in my     
 office.                               
    I have no fixed time for lunch,    
 sandwiches made by my wife or         
 sometimes a snack at a{pub}with       
 colleagues.                           
   I leave the office at 5:30pm and    
 have dinner at 6:00pm.                
   I read the paper,then work in the   
 garden until 9:30.I go to bed with my 
 Wife at 11:45pm.                      </content>
