		<title>07Arrow Valley Park.</title>
		<content> In 1973 the{Redditch Development      
{Corporation}decided a park should be  
 provided for the people of Redditch.  
 The park spans the banks of the{River 
{Arrow}from the{Needle Museum}in the   
 north to the{Washford Mill Inn}in the 
 south. A{man-made lake}of 30 acres was
 dug and the soil used for the building
 of{highway}embankments. The lake is   
 used for dinghy sailing, sailboarding,
 canoeing and{fishing.}The lake is     
 stocked with Rudd, Perch, Roach and   
 Carp. It is appropriate that there    
 should be good fishing in a town with 
 a history of fishing tackle making.   
 The park has picnic areas, pathways   
 and a bridleway. There are various    
 open spaces (some left wild), football
 pitches and newly planted areas in the
 park's 900 acres. It is the site of   
 the annual{Water Fiesta}and{Chicken   
{Run.  }                               </content>
