		<title>08A TYPICAL FARM</title>
		<content> Manor Farm is situated some two       
 kilometres west of East Leake and     
 consists of 250acres.                 
 There are 250 cows,mostly             
 Friesians.The farmer milks them twice 
 daily.At the moment,the land in use is
 growing,68 acres of winter wheat,60   
 acres of barley and 30 acres of       
 oilseed rape.                         
 50 acres of the land is rented from   
 Lord Belper's son.Previously,Lord     
 Belper owned all the land.He gave it  
 to his son who then ran the farm but  
 later sold most of the land.          
 The old farm house was originally     
 built for the squire of West Leake.   
 Manor Farm is a family business and   
 the farmer will pass it on to his son 
 when he retires.                      
 Apart from obvious problems with the  
 weather,the farmer reports that his   
 only worries are pneumonia in cows.   </content>
