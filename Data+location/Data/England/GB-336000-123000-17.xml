		<title>17A Local Craftswoman's Day</title>
		<content> Sibylle Wex lives on the Burton       
 Pynsent Estate and works at home. She 
 has a very big bedroom in which she   
 sleeps and works. She paints on silk  
 and then leaves the silk to dry, while
 on another piece of silk she applies  
 some gutta which keeps the paints from
 running into one another. She         
 sometimes listens to some music on the
 radio. At about 12 o'clock, she has a 
 coffee break. She makes herself a cup 
 of coffee and a sandwich and maybe she
 has a piece of chocolate. She starts  
 to paint at least three bits of silk  
 which she makes into blouses later.   
 She starts to make the evening meal   
 when the children come home. After the
 evening meal she watches television or
 listens to music. While doing that she
 hems the scarves that have been       
 steamed that day before she goes to   
 bed at about half past 10.            </content>
