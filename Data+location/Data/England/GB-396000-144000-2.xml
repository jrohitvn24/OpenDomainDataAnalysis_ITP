		<content> Topography and Settlement             
 The area lies across rolling chalk    
 downland on the southern edge of      
 Salisbury Plain. Ninety per cent of   
 the area falls within the Military    
 Training area, however the remaining  
 ten per cent and a third of the       
 Military holding is used for          
 agriculture. A winterbourne at a mean 
 elevation of 95 metres runs into      
 Chitterne in the south east from the  
 north.  The highest point of land is  
 183 metres.                           
 The village is bisected by the        
 southern boundary, and there is no    
 other habitation in the area.  The    
 total population of the village is    
 200, with  shop, church, racing       
 stables, pub, small garage and a      
 builder's business, although only the 
 three former and roughly half the     
 population are situated in this area. </content>
