		<title>12LOOKING AT THE HEDGE ROWS</title>
		<content> We went out to study{hedgerows}in our 
 area. We measured one hedge.It's      
 height was 2.20M. and the width was   
 1.50M. We saw that it had been cut by 
 machine and was not right at the edge 
 of the road.We saw quite a few{birds  
 near the hedge including blackbirds,  
 starlings, swallows and sparrows. The 
 hedges we looked at were mostly       
{hawthorn}but we also found sycamore   
 and elderberry. We saw a man          
 hedge-cutting with a machine. He cut  
 all the flowers and spoilt the animals
{habitat.}Another person told us about 
 a{medieval}hedge which we saw from a  
 distance. This hedge was near Great   
 Plumstead woods. Most of the fields in
 our area were enclosed by hedges,but  
 there were a few fences.
