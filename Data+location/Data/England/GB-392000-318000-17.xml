		<title>17Careers in Rising Brook.</title>
		<content>  Rising Brook High School is situated 
on the A449 Wolverhampton Road not far 
from the M6 motorway.  It offers       
education for children in the Rising   
Brook and Moss Pit area.               
  The school closely liaises with the  
careers office providing a mutual link 
between the two.  Every 2-3 years a    
careers convention is held.  The top   
half of the school is optimistic about 
gaining employment but the lower half  
is pessimistic.                        
  For those who are successful, their  
employment is usually in the immediate 
area such as working at G.E.C..  The   
pupils who stay on into the 6th form   
tend to go further afield.  In 1983    
the 5th form objected to the Youth     
Training Scheme but more recently they 
have been more enthusiastic.
