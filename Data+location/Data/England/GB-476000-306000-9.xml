{   __________________________         
   The harvesting of grass for silage, 
 and of straw for bedding, has been    
 revolutionised by the introduction of 
 a big_baler. Several farms possess    
 tractors that are not only powerful   
 but complex: spikes to move big bales,
 loaders to move material or clean     
 cattle yards. They pull four furrow   
 reversible ploughs which allow rapid  
 autumn cultivations. Two farms possess
 combine harvesters. Two specialist    
 grain stores, and four purpose-built  
 cattleyards have been erected. Several
 farms have mills to roll barley for   
 stock feed.                           
        One farmer uses electric       
 fencing to contain his stock and the  
 dairy farmer has an electric milking  
 parlour. Pesticides and fungicides are
 used when necessary.                  </content>
