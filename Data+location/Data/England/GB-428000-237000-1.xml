		<title>01THE BRAILES AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the area lies within the      
 parish of Brailes situated in the     
 southernmost part of rural            
 Warwickshire.                         
   It is a region of intensively farmed
 highly productive land crossed by     
 numerous footpaths and bridleways from
 which delightful views of the         
 countryside can be seen.Overlooking   
 the whole area stands Brailes Hill    
 rising to seven hundred feet and      
 topped by Highwall Spinney, a land    
 mark for many miles around.           
  The main centres of population are   
 the villages of Upper and Lower       
 Brailes which stretch for one and a   
 half miles along the B4O35.Nearby are 
 the hamlets of Winderton and Sutton_  
 under_Brailes. Banbury is ten miles to
 the east, four miles to the west is   
 the small town of Shipston_on_Stour.
