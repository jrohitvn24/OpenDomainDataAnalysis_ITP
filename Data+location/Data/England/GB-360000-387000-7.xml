		<content>{The Warrington Guardian               
    This was founded as a family       
 newspaper by A.Mackie in 1853. There  
 is now a main edition for Warrington  
 with special editions for the         
 districts - Stockton                  
 Heath,Lymm,and Penketh, with a Midweek
 edition as well.                      
    The front page carries stories of  
 national issues as they affect this   
 locality eg. acid rain. There are also
 local items - Walking Day, council    
 matters and advertisements.           
    Over half of the paper is given    
 over to advertising, a lucrative      
 source of finance for production      
 costs. Modern technology, photography 
 and investigative journalism combine  
 to produce a newspaper which          
 accurately reflects the society, gives
 information, acts as a watchdog and is
 a truly independent publication.      </content>
