		<title>08Tempsford Divided ?</title>
		<content> The village of Tempsford has always   
 been divided by a road.There is a     
 Church end to the village and a       
 Station end,this has not helped to    
 foster a close village community.Yet  
 now new plans are afoot which would   
 make ths situation even worse.        
 The purposed plan is to close all     
 intersections off the A1 between the  
 Blackcat roundabout and Sandy .This   
 plan  has caused great concern in the 
 village because if passed it would    
 further isolate the two ends of the   
 village.Local residents have          
 established committes to fight the    
 plan and are demanding the building of
 a footbridge or some other form of    
 lifeline to unite the two ends of the 
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
