		<title>04COUNTY HALL, ABINGDON</title>
		<content>The present County Hall had been       
preceded by at least three other       
buildings.  In 1327  during a riot, the
Abingdon people attacked the Abbey and 
destroyed the "New House on the Market 
Square".  The hall was rebuilt, "a fair
house, with open pillars covered with a
roof of lead for market folk".  It     
contained a courtroom, prison and a    
covered market.  The present County    
Hall was built in 1686, when James 11  
proclaimed Abingdon the county town of 
Berkshire.   Restoration work took     
place between 1952-1956 and it was     
re-opened by Queen Elizabeth 11 in     
1956. On Mondays, it is market day, and
the County Hall has a few stalls, it   
now has a museum on the first floor.   
Bun throwing is done from the top of   
the County Hall.(see page 5).
