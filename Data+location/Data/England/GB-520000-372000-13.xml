		<content> A plaque on the Almshouses announces  
 " This Hospital and school were       
 erected in the year 1727 by Jane      
 Dymoke."  Jane was widow of the Hon.  
 Charles Dymoke of Scrivelsby Court.   
 Charles Dymoke was the champion of    
 England and his descendant Colonel    
 Dymoke who still lives in Scrivelsby  
 is now champion of England.           
    The Almshouses originally were four
 houses for poor widows and a house for
 a schoolmistress.Jane Dymoke also     
 built and endowed a free school for   
 poor children with provision for the  
 poorer ones and an apprenticeship     
 scheme for boys.The  boys had their   
 own school which is now a village     
 hall. The girls were taught by the    
 schoolmistress in the middle Almshouse
 cottage where she lived.Later the     
 girls were allowed the use of the     
 church Sunday school.                 </content>
