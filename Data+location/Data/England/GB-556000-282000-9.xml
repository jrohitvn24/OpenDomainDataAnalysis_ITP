		<title>09Drainage Museum, Prickwillow</title>
		<content> Near Prickwillow Bridge is the        
 Village's Land Drainage Museum which  
 has recently opened. It houses a      
 Vickers Two Cylinder diesel pump which
 still works even though it started    
 life in 1924. It pumps 140 tons of    
 water a minute. It can pump water over
 a height of 14 feet but the maximum   
 needed at Prickwillow is 6 feet.      
{Alec Gathercole and Pat Cox}work      
 in the Museum, Alec has worked on the 
 Engine for over 57 years.             
 The Museum is run by the Prickwillow  
 Engine Trust and is open from May     
 until September every day.            
 Alec told us that when he balances a  
 coin on the massive engine as it is   
 working, it will not fall down.
