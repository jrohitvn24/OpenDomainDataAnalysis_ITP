		<title>06THE PUBLIC IN AWBRIDGE</title>
		<content>      Four of the fourth year pupils   
 went out to interview the public in{  
{Awbridge.}                            
      They interviewed four people all 
 of whom had lived in{Awbridge}for at  
 least five years.  Most people used   
 the village hall as a meeting place.  
      One man noticed that when he     
 first came to live in the village     
 everybody worked on the farms.  Now   
 most people work away from the        
 village.                              
      One woman thought that there were
 too many cars speeding through the    
 village and that there should be more 
 speed limits.  A man thought village  
 life should be compact but it isn't.  
 Someone noticed an increase of houses 
 meaning more people coming to live in 
 the villlage.  Nobody wanted the      
 village to change in the future and   
 most people had no worries.           </content>
