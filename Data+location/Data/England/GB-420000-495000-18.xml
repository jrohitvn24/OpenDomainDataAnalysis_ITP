		<content> A number of woods are self planted.   
 That is to say seeds from trees have  
 taken root where they have fallen and 
 with the passing of time a woodland   
 has been created. Birds and the wind  
 have also carried and introduced      
 different species into a copse. This  
 has happened in disused quarries and  
 what was once a Lime Kiln. These self 
 planted woods tend to be deciduous    
 whereas the plantations tend to be    
 coniferous, man prefering the         
 protection given by the fir trees     
 against the prevailing winds. A bridle
 path leads from the Lime Kiln wood    
 area across the fields to Tunstall and
 horse riders exercise their rights to 
 use it. A right of way stretches from 
 Low Green Catterick to Brough Park and
 this is a very popular walk with dog  
 owners.                               
                                       </content>
