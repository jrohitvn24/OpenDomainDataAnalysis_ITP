		<content>   {Cattle}are kept for both milk and  
 beef. One farmer in{Bleasby Moor}has a
 large herd of Friesian cows, kept for 
{milking.}They are kept outside in the 
 summer. In the early part of the      
 summer they are kept on unimproved    
 pasture. Later on, they are put onto  
 fields from which one or two crops of 
 hay or silage have been taken. These  
 fields are fertilized to promote      
 grass-growth. The large, round bales  
 of hay are individually wrapped in    
 polythene bags, and stored around the 
 edges of the field. The hay and silage
 are used to feed the cattle when they 
 are kept under cover in the crew-yards
 during the winter.                    
    The Friesian cows bear Hereford or 
 Charolais cross calves, which are     
 fattened up to be sold for{beef.}A    
 farmer at{East Torrington}keeps a herd
 of these on ridge and furrow pasture. </content>
