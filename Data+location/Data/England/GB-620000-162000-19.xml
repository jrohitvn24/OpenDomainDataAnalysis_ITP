		<title>19UPSTREET GEN. DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Where I live there is a farm and it is
 called Upstreet Farm.  There are two  
 big flats where we live and I don't   
 want to move until I am older.  We    
 live near a park called Grove Ferry   
 and we are in the country and new     
 houses have been built here.  We live 
 near Grove Court and the Upstreet Farm
 has got some chickens and they make a 
 lot of noise every day and you can    
 hear them at our house.  A mile away  
 is our school which is not that big.  
 At our school we have got a big       
 playground.  Near me there is an inn  
 called the Ship Inn, two shops, a post
 office and a farm shop.  Near us is my
 friends house.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
