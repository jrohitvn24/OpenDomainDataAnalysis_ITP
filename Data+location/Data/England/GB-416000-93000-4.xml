		<content>  At the roundabout we took the third  
 turning  towards Highcliffe. Too our  
 right was Plessey's, a large          
 communication and electronics firm.   
  On our right was a few older style   
 bungalows , a small green and a new   
 housing estate called Hoburne. Ahead  
 lay a new 200 yard section of dual    
 carriageway and a large roundabout.   
  Ahead towards the left was the old   
 Christchurch airfield which is now a  
 new housing estate. Nearly all the    
 roads are named after famous          
 aeronautical names.                   
  We turned left into Hoburne Road.    
 There was a large Caravan Park to our 
 right with houses beyond . To our left
 the new Housing estate had some more  
 houses being built. The estate stopped
 suddenly and there was a large field  
 with a few animals in it.
