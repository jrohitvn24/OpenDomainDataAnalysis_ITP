		<content>Didcot Leisure Centre is to be opened  
officially in September 1985.  It has  
been built near St. Birinus, the       
Secondary School for boys, which will  
be just one of the organisations to    
benefit from it.  It contains four     
squash courts, a gymnasium, rock-      
climbing facilities, a main hall for   
table tennis etc. and a weight-training
room.  There is a balcony, a lounge and
a bar.  There is a lift for disabled   
people, toilets and changing rooms.    
The gymnasium can be used for cricket, 
netball, basketball, volleyball and    
many other sports.  It took about 18   
months to build the Centre.  It is     
hoped that schools, sports associations
and the general public will take       
advantage of the Leisure Centre.  Many 
residents have indicated that an indoor
swimming pool should be next on the    
list of priorities for the area.       </content>
