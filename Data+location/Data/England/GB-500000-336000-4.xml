		<title>04NEW USE FOR FORMER QUARRY.</title>
		<content> This quarry is now a testing ground   
 for dumpers and excavators made by    
 Aveling and Barford in Grantham.No    
 staff is employed at the quarry and it
 is used only intermittently.It        
 provides no jobs for local people.Some
 of the machines which are tested here 
 are special orders to be dispatched to
 distant parts of the world.           
 Once this quarry provided sand and    
 gravel from a morainic pocket left    
 behind in the last Ice Age.The uneven 
 surfaces and varying levels which     
 provide such a good testing ground for
 heavy machines are also exploited once
 or twice a year by a local motor-cycle
 club for scrambling races.            
 A minor Roman road ran along the east 
 edge and some Roman remains have been 
 found here.
