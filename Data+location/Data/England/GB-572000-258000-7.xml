		<title>07The village hall, Ousden</title>
		<content> The village hall is where most        
 activities take place. It is run by   
 the village committee who organise    
 various events there. Dances are also 
 arranged although not as frequently   
 now as they used to. The Womens'      
 Institute meet there in the warmer    
 months, but not in winter as the      
 heating is inadequate. the Parish     
 Council and the Community Council also
 hold their meetings in the hall which 
 is also available for hire for such   
 things as jumble sales, weddings and  
 parties. Adjoining the hall is the    
 playing field which is used for       
 village events such as band concerts, 
 car boot sales etc. The neighbouring  
 village of Lidgate plays cricket      
 there. The hall was originally a      
 prisoner of war hut and was donated in
 1920 by Mr Praed, who was then Lord of
 the Manor.Ousden day is held each year</content>
