		<title>15WHAT MY MUM DOES ON A MONDAY</title>
		<content> When I've gone to school she cleans   
 the rabbit out and feeds it then she  
 feeds our cat.Next she puts the       
 washing in the washing machine,then   
 she takes Christopher to playschool   
 and sometimes goes to the shop and    
 butchers.When she gets home she hangs 
 the washing out and hoovers the house 
 and dusts the living room.Then she has
 a cup of tea and a biscuit.If she has 
 time she makes the beds before she    
 gets Christopher from playschool.When 
 she gets home she makes lunch.After   
 lunch she does the washing up and     
 sometimes she does some gardening or  
 some cake making.When we asked our    
 mothers about living in Flamstead they
 said they liked it but didn't like    
 having to go long distances to shop   
 or take their children to the dentist 
 or doctor.On the whole they like      
 living in Flamstead.                  </content>
