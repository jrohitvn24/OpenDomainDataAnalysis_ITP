		<content> The larger settlement can be found at 
{Stanford Dingley}where the{River Pang 
 is bridged. The only other            
 concentrated collection of houses can 
 be found in{Tutt's Clump,}where there 
 are some comparitively small housing  
 estates. The majority of houses can be
 found on or just off the minor roads  
 approaching these two central focal   
 points. The majority being            
 semi-detached or detached. While the  
 majority of the houses along routeways
 appear to have been built in the past 
 seventy years, the majority of        
 Stanford Dingley's housing is much    
 older and possesses large gardens.    
 Some of the original constructions may
 date back to the{Georgian}eras and the
 two public houses represent fine      
 examples of{Jacobean}architecture.
