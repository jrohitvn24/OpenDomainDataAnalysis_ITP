		<title>19BMX riding in W.Loughborough</title>
		<content> BMX riding is a bike sport. The       
 bicycles have a strong, light frame   
 and knobbly tyres. For BMX riding we  
 wear special equipment.The gloves are 
 made of wool and plastic or leather.We
 also use{helmets}which are made of    
 plastic,fibre glass and foam. The BMX 
 suits are padded on the shins and     
 knees and somtimes on the hips.The top
 is padded from the shoulder downwards.
 We ride our bikes on{Shepherd's Hill  
 because there isn't a track in Lough.,
 but they will be making one soon.     
 Freestyle BMX riding involves tricks  
 on ramps and quarter pipes. BMX is    
 cheaper, more exciting and safer than 
 motor bike riding. The{Disused Railway
 has a new gravel surface and many     
 children use this track for riding    
 their BMX bikes on. Many mums also use
 the track, to take their children to  
 and from{Booth Wood}primary school.   </content>
