 Butter, St.Ivel, Vern air, Eastern Air
 executive and Wickenby Aviation all   
 use the airstrip. The company{Dollar  
 own a{Bell Jetranger}helicopter which 
 is used for charter flights, aerial   
 photography and pleasure trips.       
{Swindon Gliding Club}use the airfield 
 in the evening and at weekends. Their 
 gliders are a familiar sight in our   
 evening skies.                        
 The airfield has been purchased by    
{Honda}who are developing the site (see
 page 7). The{Vickers}jet will move to 
 a nearby RAF station,{Dollar}however  
 will continue to operate from the     
 field.{Honda}intend to use the field  
 as part of a vehicle testing track;   
 they may also use the runway for      
 executive aircraft, but this has not  
 been made clear. It would be a sad day
 if the airfield fell into disuse.     </content>
