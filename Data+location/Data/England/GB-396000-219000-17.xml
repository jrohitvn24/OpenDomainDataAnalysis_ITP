 ON ANIMALS SHOULD BE BANNED.THE       
 FOULING OF FOOTPATHS AND PUBLIC GRASS,
 BY DOGS,AND THE PRACTICE OF BLOOD     
 SPORTS WERE STRONGLY OBJECTED TO.     
 HOWEVER DOGS WERE SEEN AS SUITABLE    
 TOWN PETS.                            
{CRIME}THE LAW IS TOO LENIENT.LIFE     
 IMPRISONMENT FOR MURDER SHOULD MEAN   
 EXACTLY THAT.INTERVIEWS WERE DIVIDED  
 OVER THE NEED TO ARM POLICE AND HOW   
 TO DEAL WITH DRUNKEN DRIVERS.ACTS OF  
 PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WERE SEEN AS THE    
 MOST WORRING CRIME TODAY.             
{TOWN EXPANSION}THE COUNTRYSIDE IS     
 DISAPPEARING TOO MUCH. PROPERTY       
 DEVELOPERS,TOO MANY PEOPLE,TOWN       
 PLANNERS,BUILDERS,FARMERS AND         
 GOVERMENT WERE ALL BLAMED.            </content>
