   The area is mainly a farming area   
 with a number of villages ( Flockton, 
 Overton, Middlestown and Netherton )  
 and several places of local beauty (  
 i.e. Coxley Valley and Stocks moor    
 Common ).                             
   With little industry apart from     
 Denby Grange Colliery and Earnshaw's  
 timber yard, the villages are         
 dormitory villages for people who work
 in the surrounding large towns.       
   There is a great deal of industrial 
 history ( old bell pits and railway   
 lines both horse drawn and pulled by  
 cable ).                              
   The area lacks any large shops and  
 most of the shopping is done in the   
 surrounding towns.
