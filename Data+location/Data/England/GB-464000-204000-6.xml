		<content>In the grounds of Rycote chapel there  
is part of a footpath called The       
Oxfordshire Way.From Rycote it goes to 
Albury ,through Tiddington,and on to   
Waterstock.It is not an old path but a 
leisure path.The old paths link the    
farms,hamlets and villages.There are   
only two places where the old footpaths
go alongside the river-at Ickford and  
at Shabbington.The footpath from the   
church to Manor Farm at Shabbington    
goes past an earthwork,which looks like
a long hump in the ground.It was       
covered in buttercups.Many of the      
fields with footpaths have herds of    
cattle;they come very close and can be 
frightening.We saw hedges with more    
than 10 plant types-Elder,Plum,Birch,  
Alder,Hawthorn,Dog Rose,Hazel,Rowan,   
Bramble,Sloe- in one small bit of hedge
in the Shabbington area.We identified  
10 different kinds of grasses.         </content>
