		<title>15RENOVATION AT GRETTON,SHROPS</title>
		<content>    The Malthouse,Gretton,had been     
 uninhabited for many years,and        
 derelict when major restoration was   
 undertaken during 1984/5. Originally  
 two cottages built in local stone,    
 each were two up two down with neither
 electricity nor sanitation, and water 
 was drawn by means of a cast iron hand
 pump from a deep stone built well.    
    The restoration took 6 months and  
 involved reroofing,reflooring,        
 replastering and redesigning inside to
 provide a very comfortable four bed-  
 roomed house with 2 bathrooms and full
 central heating.                      
    Care was taken to preserve many of 
 the original features-half timbered   
 partition walls,heavily timbered      
 ceilings and massive inglenook        
 fireplaces,and yet incorporate all the
 modern services and comforts of today.
