		<content> We went to the Cross Roads Garage.    
 They have a 24 hour breakdown and     
 recovery service for cars and lorries.
 The garage sells petrol and sweets.   
 They mend cars  and test cars and do  
 bodywork. We made some charts about   
 vehicles. On Monday at 9.55 a.m. there
 was one motor bike, four vans, one    
 tractor, and one lorry going past the 
 school. On Tuesday at 1.30 p.m. we    
 stood outside the school and we       
 watched the traffic from there. We    
 found that there were more cars coming
 out of the village than into the      
 village. We went on to the main road  
 and on Monday we had sixteen cars     
 going to Daventry and twenty two going
 to Southam. There were more lorries   
 going to Daventry because there are   
 more factories there and you can go on
 to the motorway at Daventry.
