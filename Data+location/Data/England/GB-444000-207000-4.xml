		<title>04Wytham, a country village.</title>
		<content> Wytham village nestles at the foot of 
 Wytham hill. Bounded by water meadows 
 and backed by woodland, the village is
 very rural. The small stone cottages  
 are thatched or tiled. Old farms have 
 been divided up to house families but 
 everywhere the original style of      
 building has been preserved. At the   
 centre of the village is the pub,next 
 to the War Memorial and facing the    
 Post Office and the village store. Up 
 the hill are the church and Wytham    
 Abbey, not connected, but adjacent.   
 Stone walls surround many of the      
 buildings, but soon give way to hedges
 A single road goes through the village
 linking it in one direction with      
 Wolvercote and in the other with the  
 A34, bypassing Oxford to the west.    
 Tiny hump-backed stone bridges take   
 the road over the river. Truly, 'a    
 village in a bend'.                   </content>
