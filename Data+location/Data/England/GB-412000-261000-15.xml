		<title>15 CREDITS  :  Wootton Wawen</title>
		<content>     When our group originally         
 committed itself to surveying a block 
 of the map it naturally expected to be
 responsible for the block in which its
 school, Studley C.E. Junior School, is
 situated.  The group did not expect to
 be allocated an area with which it had
 no connection.  It was further        
 revealed that the obvious school to   
 carry out the survey (Wootton         
 Wawen C.E Junior School) had itself   
 not been allocated this area.         
                                       
     Studley C.E. Junior School carried
 out a very comprehensive survey of its
 own village, Studley.  However, this  
 was for local interest only and was   
 not carried out for the "Domesday     
 Project".                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
