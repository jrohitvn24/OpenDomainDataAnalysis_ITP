		<title>11HOUSE MODERNISATION. WILLEY.</title>
		<content> This cottage was converted in 1983    
 from two substandard agricultural     
 cottages. Water had previously been   
 delivered in churns there being       
 neither mains supply or a well. A well
 was sunk, but 1984 drought conditions 
 dried this and making a bore hole of  
 900 feet gave a good supply of water  
 of 50 gallons a minute.               
 Electicity supplies existed but septic
 tank drainage had to be installed.    
 Most of the cottages had to be        
 demolished but the stone gable end    
 with bread oven and inglenook were    
 kept as were existing beams, preserved
 by propping &amp; shoring up whilst the   
 external walls were built.            
 The house is a retirement home for an 
 architect and his wife who intend to  
 paint and develop a hillside garden.
