		<title>06    THE PANNIER MARKET</title>
		<content> The market is set high near the Town  
 centre. In the Pannier Market are the 
 sounds of bustling{crowds}shopping,   
 selling and chatting. People come from
 a 20 to 30 mile radius from Tavistock,
 Liskeard, Plymouth, Holsworthy, Bodmin
 and Okehampton.It is a{colourful}scene
 with rows of swinging clothes and     
 piles of fruit and vegetables.The     
 clothes were made in Italy, France,   
 U.S.A.,Spain, Korea and Hong Kong.The 
{seasonal goods}like bedding plants,   
 spring cabbage, strawberies, cherries 
 and onions were mostly grown locally. 
 Other{stalls}sell fabrics,sweets,fish,
 bric_a_brac,jewellery,china,tools,    
 wool,dairy produce,toys,books and ice 
 cream.The fish comes from Plymouth and
 much of the fruit from the Tamar      
 Valley.The buisiest stall is the green
 grocer's because people in town do not
 grow enough vegetables for daily use. </content>
