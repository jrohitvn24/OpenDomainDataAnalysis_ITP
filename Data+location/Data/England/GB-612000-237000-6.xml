    This is a mainly agricultural area 
with many farms such as Bluegate       
Farm,Hubbard's Hall Farm etc.          
    On the farm where my Dad works     
there are six people who help.Their    
names are Mark Reson,Tony Matthews (my 
dad),Geoffry Bullhead,Bob Pain,Archie  
Lake and Archie Wilson.Archie Wilson   
owns half the farm and his brother owns
the other half.They also own another   
farm at Stutton .The farm grows mainly 
corn, sugar beet,oil seed rape,potatoes
and turnips.My Dad mainly does rolling,
combining,ploughing, and potato        
picking.                               
    On the farm we have two            
international tractors and one deutsch.
Altogether on the two farms there are  
cows, chickens and four dogs:There are 
cats with babies in some of the sheds. 
This farm is typical of the area.      </content>
