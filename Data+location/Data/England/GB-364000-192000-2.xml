		<content>The centre is on 100 acres of land.    
Most of this land is rented out to     
farmers. The centre trains people to   
use and mend hospital equipment.       
This does not include the medical side 
of hospitals.There are 90 resident     
students.Extra students use bed and    
breakfast near the centre.The cost for 
NHS students is 165 pounds and for     
private is 320 pounds.Last year 2537   
students attended the one/two week     
courses serviced by 19 lecturers and 5 
demonstrators.The budget for the       
centre is 400,000 pounds.The centre    
was formerly a Civil Defence building  
but was taken over by the NHS          
Works/Dept. of Training in 1969 and in 
April 1984 was changed entirely to     
NHS training.The other main centre for 
this type of training is at Harrogate.
