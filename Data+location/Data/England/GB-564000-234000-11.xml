		<title>11TWO HOUSES IN GT SAMPFORD</title>
		<content> The Mill House used to be a           
 windmill.It was a Tower Mill.The house
 has used the first two floors of the  
 mill.The roof is thatched.The rest of 
 the house has been built from the     
 bricks of the old blacksmith's forge  
 which was infront of the 0ld          
 windmill.The rooms in the old mill are
 octagonal.The owner has set the old   
 cog wheels in the floor.The old mill  
 stone makes part of the path.         
 Free Roberts is one of the oldest     
 houses in the area.Some of it was     
 built in the eleventh century.It was  
 recorded in the first Domesday        
 Book.The house got its name because   
 the owner had a serf called           
 Robert.One day he gave him a house    
 and its land because the serf saved   
 his life.The serf called the house    
 Free Roberts because he was now a free
 man.                                  </content>
