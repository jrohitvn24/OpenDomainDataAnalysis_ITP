		<title>18 Goodmayes Bungalow estate</title>
		<content> There are lots of terraced and semi   
 detached houses but not many detached 
 ones in the Goodmayes area we surveyed
 there are many{bungalows}on the right 
 hand side of Goodmayes Lane. Some     
 people call it the "Bungalow Estate". 
 Most houses were built in the early   
 19OOs. Although many were bombed in   
 World War II, they were rebuilt in the
 same style. Along Goodmayes Lane and  
 Green Lane there are many{shops}with  
 flats above them. Most houses all look
 the same with two storeys, three      
 bedrooms often with bay windows at the
 front, small front{gardens}and larger 
 back gardens. Because there are no    
 garages, people have knocked down     
 their front garden wall to make space 
 for parking their{car.
