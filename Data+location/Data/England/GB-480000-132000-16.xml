 Hall at Standford has a thriving      
 Sunday School, midweek prayer meeting,
 and on Sunday, morning communion and a
 further afternoon or evening service. 
  The small but attractively built and 
 sited Roman Catholic Church at Liphook
 has a Church Hall used by handicapped 
 Girl Guides and by Passfield Women's  
 Institute, the 40 members of which    
 mostly live in Liphook.               
  Recently formed,'The Standford       
 Singers', 10-14 persons, are keen to  
 entertain local groups and communities
 with light or serious 4 part music,   
 mostly sung unaccompanied.            
  Passfield Working Men's Club, with   
 advantages of cheaper drinks, has a   
 resident barman. Besides billiards,   
 darts and gaming machines,the whole   
 family can be involved in whist or    
 Bingo, floor shows and outings.       </content>
