		<title>12The Forest Keeper.</title>
		<content> The duties of a New Forest Keeper are 
 many and varied.He is responsible for 
{recreation,enforcement of by-laws}and 
 the overseeing of all aspects of{     
{wildlife.}There are many pressures on 
 The New Forest in the                 
 1980's,especially the massive influx  
 of visitors to the  area.He has to    
 control the illegal camping of people 
 and ensure they are aware of the      
 by-laws.The population of{Grey        
{Squirrels}is kept down by{culling,}as 
 is the numbers of deer,rabbits and    
 hares.He is also very much concerned  
 with the preservation of the ecology  
 as there are many types of wild       
 flowers etc.which are in danger of    
 extinction.One of the rarest snakes to
 be found on{Plain Heath}is the{Smooth 
{Snake,}a harmless,non-venomous        
 variety.
