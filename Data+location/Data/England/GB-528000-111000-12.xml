		<title>12WAYFIELD FARM</title>
		<content> We visited Wayfield Farm and talked to
 the owner. It is 134 acres large with 
 another 5O acres rented at Fulking.   
 The farm house is probably recorded in
 the original Domesday Book. It was    
 also a coaching station 2OO years ago.
 Instead of horses and carts of years  
 ago, today there are tractors costing 
 Â£16,OOO each, trailers and cultivators
 at work. The farm specialises in      
 Charelais beef cattle using a         
 Charelais bull. Friesian cows are used
 to feed the calves. Cattle are sold at
 Haywards Heath market. In 194O a      
 bullock fetched Â£9O, today Â£6OO. Then 
 fertilisers cost less than Â£4O per ton
 now it is Â£18O. As well as the traffic
 thundering on the A23, belonging to   
 the EEC has caused problems. For      
 rearing a calf worth Â£18 the          
 Government subsidy was Â£18. Now the   
 calf costs Â£14O with no subsidy given.</content>
