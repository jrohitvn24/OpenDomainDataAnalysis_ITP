		<title>04Old Houses and New</title>
		<content> Some houses in our area are new,but   
 many houses are very old.The old      
 houses are mostly made out of         
 millstone grit.The older houses are   
 usually{terraced houses}built in long 
 rows.Many houses have gardens,but some
 have been built 'back-to-back'.The old
 houses mostly have roofs made out of  
 slates.                               
      Some of the old houses are being 
 knocked down.{New houses}have been    
 built in the same area.The new houses 
 are of many different kinds.In Salt   
 Street two houses have been knocked   
 down,and they are building new houses 
 there.A mosque and a house have been  
 knocked down.In Valley Parade there   
 were shops and houses knocked down and
 a petrol filling station has been     
 built.Some blocks of flats were built 
 about twenty years ago near our       
 school.                               </content>
