		<title>19INTERVIEW LORD ABERGAVENNY</title>
		<content> Lord Abergavenny's full name is       
 Colonel the Marquess of Abergavenny   
 K.G. O.B.E. J.P. Lord Abergavenny's   
 typical day is not really a typical   
 day because he is always doing        
 something different every day. We     
 asked him for a week in his life. On  
 Monday we went to see him, on Tuesday 
 he was going to Brighton as the Lord  
 Lieutenant to look after Princess Ann 
 for the day and then he went on up to 
 London. The next day he drove to Epsom
 to go to the Derby.  On Thursday he   
 went to the South of England show and 
 on Friday he returned to Ardingly and 
 stayed there for dinner because       
 someone was leaving.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
