		<title>18Traffic Counts (M18,B6060)</title>
		<content> On the 20th of June 1985 we did a     
 traffic count on the M18 and on the   
 road outside our school.We counted the
 traffic in a fifteen minute period. We
 found out that 50% of the traffic on  
 the motorway were cars.On the B6060   
 (the road outside our school) it  was 
 74%. We found that 38% of the traffic 
 on the motorway were lorries.On the   
 B6060 it was 6%.Of the traffic on the 
 motorway 9% were vans and on the B6060
 there were 15%.More of the traffic on 
 the motorway was lorries than on the  
 B6060 because on the motorway lorries 
 are taking heavy goods a long way.It  
 is also easier and faster for them.The
 large percentage of lorries on the    
 motorways means that cars and buses   
 and other traffic cover a smaller     
 percentage.Much of the traffic on the 
 B6060 was smaller vehicles.
