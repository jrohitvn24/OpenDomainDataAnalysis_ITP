		<content>{Budgenor Lodge}was built in 1794 and  
 was known as the{Easebourne Union.}It 
 was taken over by the London          
 authorities in 1830 and became known  
 as the{Workhouse.}In 1950 it was      
 turned into an{Old People's Home}and  
 was used as such for over twenty      
 years.  In the late 1970's the Sussex 
 County Council took over and used it  
 to accommodate the homeless.  Budgenor
 Lodge can accommodate 30 families in  
 small units, the sizes of which vary  
 according to the size of the family.  
 Each unit contains a sink, wardrobe   
 and cooker.  In the case of unmarried 
 mothers a bathroom and kitchen are    
 shared.  A dormitory is available for 
 "gentlemen of the road".  The average 
 length of time for which people can   
 stay at the Lodge varies from six to  
 nine months.
