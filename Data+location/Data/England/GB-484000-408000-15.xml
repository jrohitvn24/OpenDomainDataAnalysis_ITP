		<title>15Outside Scunthorpe.</title>
		<content> We went up to the bridge on New Dyke  
 Road which crosses the M181 motorway  
 to look around at the Trent Valley.   
 This part of the motorway is a short  
 spur road between Scunthorpe and the  
 M180. Near the bridge is a pond where 
 people can fish. We could see for     
 about 10 miles all around. The flat   
 land between the Trent and the hills  
 called Scunthorpe Heights is good     
 arable land. We could see where our   
 school was in Scunthorpe because of   
 the spire of the Church of the Holy   
 Spirit sticking up against the sky.   
 The church is just across the road    
 from our school. Other buildings we   
 could pick out were, the General      
 Hospital, Technical College and the   
 derelict Normanby Park steelworks. We 
 could see the river's course by the   
 cranes at Flixborough Wharf. Keadby   
 Bridge was like a big roller-coaster. </content>
