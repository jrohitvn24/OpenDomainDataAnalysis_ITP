		<title>18LIFE IN NEWHAM</title>
		<content> Life in Newham is good sometimes and  
 boring othertimes. It is good when    
 clubs are open like the Mayflower and 
 Gannon Point club and when the parks  
 are open as you can hire a tennis     
 court. Also my friends and neighbours 
 are friendly. But where I live there  
 is a public house and the music is too
 loud of a night time, and we get a lot
 of boys come round my way and play    
 tennis so no one can play downstairs. 
 I live in a maisonette, we have not   
 got a garden or a small balcony so you
 feel shut in a bit. I would like to   
 move but only round this way because  
 my school is here and so is my friends
 and family.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
