		<content> Morley St. Botolph  church has a      
 square tower facing west, with a large
 round clockface on it, and containing 
 three bells. In 1880 the church was   
 rebuilt on the original foundtions. In
 1950 a fierce fire destroyed the roof 
 and pews. Today the church is very    
 modernly furnished, with a beautifully
 chequered floor.                      
  The square tower of Deopham church is
 100 feet tall and stands out as       
 a landmark. It has set back           
 buttresses joined diagonally across   
 the corners. About 18 feet above      
 ground level is a band of external    
 decoration adorned with flowers and   
 fruit.                                
  Paintings were discovered on the     
 interior walls during restoration     
 work.The tower has a ring of 5 bells.
