		<content> INTRODUCTION

 is of great interest for its diverse  
 flora,fauna and history.              
 HISTORIC FACTORS                      
 The present composition of the        
 woodland is the result of a           
 combination of natural and human      
 factors acting over several thousand  
 years.It contains remnants of the     
 ancient forest which formerly clothed 
 the county.A fine stand of coppiced { 
{small leaved lime}(an ancient woodland
 indicator) covers the site of an iron 
 age camp.Lime leaves were used as     
 fodder,the bark for making ropes &amp;    
 crude cloth and the wood for fuel &amp;   
 building.The steep slopes &amp;           
 waterlogged soils of lias clay        
 probably saved the wood from clearance
 by Iron age man &amp; the Romans.
