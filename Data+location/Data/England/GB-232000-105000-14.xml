		<content>   Farming is the industry of our area.
 Most of the farmers have been farming 
 for life or became farmers some years 
 ago when land was not as expensive as 
 it is now.                            
   Farms vary in size from 28 to 372   
 acres.Livestock farming takes place in
 our area.Farmers rear cows, calves,   
 bulls, sheep and some chickens and    
 pigs.Most animals are sold for meat   
 and those remaining are used for      
 breeding.Crops such as silage, hay,   
 barley, turnips and corn are all grown
 to feed the animals.                  
   The most popular make of tractor is 
 Masey Ferguson but Ford,International,
 Case and J.Deere are also used.       
   Very few farmers employ anyone, and 
 if they do it is only usually casual  
 labour needed for harvesting crops.
