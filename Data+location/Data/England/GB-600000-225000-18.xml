		<content> I wake up at about 7:30am, and get up 
 at 8:00am. Two friends call for me at 
 8:50am and we walk to school together.
 At school the whistle is blown and we 
 walk in.We start with "Hey-Maths!" I  
 am on Tulip book. Later we have an    
 assembly with our headmaster.He tells 
 us a story from the Bible and we sing 
 a hymn.We walk back to our classrooms 
 and continue until 10:30am when we    
 have morning playtime. After play we  
 do topic work until 12:15pm which is  
 when we have our lunch. I have school 
 dinners so I go into the hall for     
 first sitting. We go back to class at 
 1:15pm. We have P.E. in the hall;     
 after that we do topics or something  
 else until story time at 2:40pm. I    
 walk home at 3:10pm. When I get home I
 relax and have a drink, then I watch  
 t.v. until tea at 5:00pm. I go to     
 Guides from 7:15pm until 9:00pm.      </content>
