		<title>10INDIAN WAR MEMORIAL</title>
		<content> The Chattri is a memorial to the      
 Indian soldiers who died fighting in  
 the First World War and who were in   
 hospital in Brighton. It is situated  
 on the Downs outside Brighton and can 
 only be approached on foot. You can   
 see the memorial for miles around     
 because it is white and stands out. It
 has a little garden surrounding it and
 it is in the shape of a small dome,   
 like a little Indian temple. The      
 garden is unfortunately rather        
 overgrown. On one side of the Chattri 
 the English inscription tells us that 
 the memorial marks the spot where the 
 soldiers' bodies were burned on a     
 traditional funeral pyre. There is an 
 inscription in Hindi on the other     
 side. Poppy wreaths and flowers had   
 recently been placed there by Indian  
 visitors. It is a very peaceful spot  
 to remember men who died far from home</content>
