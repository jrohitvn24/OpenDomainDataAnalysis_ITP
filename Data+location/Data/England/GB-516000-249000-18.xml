		<title>18THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND SANDY</title>
		<content>  TO THE EAST OF SANDY THE LAND RISES  
 TO AN AREA KNOWN AS THE PINNACLE. THE 
 PINNACLE, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE       
 SANDHILLS BECAUSE OF THE SANDY SOIL,  
 IS A FAVOURITE RECREATION AREA. FROM  
 THE TOP OF THE PINNACLE YOU ARE ABLE  
 TO OVERLOOK SANDY AND YOU REALISE THE 
 SIZE OF IT WITH THE RAILWAY RUNNING   
 MORE OR LESS PARALLEL TO THE A1.      
  THE WOODLAND AROUND THIS AREA        
 CONSISTS MOSTLY OF DECIDUOUS TREES,   
 OAK, ASH, HORSE CHESTNUT ETC, ALTHOUGH
 THERE ARE SOME CONIFERS. BEYOND THE   
 PINNACLE TRAVELLING TOWARDS THE       
 VILLAGE OF EVERTON THE WOODLANDS ARE  
 PRIVATE PROPERTY.                     
  HAZELLS HALL AND FARM ARE THE        
 PROPERTY OF FRANCIS PYM M.P. HOWEVER, 
 THE FAMILY DO NOT RESIDE AT THE HALL  
 BUT AT THE NEARBY EVERTON PARK.       
 HAZELLS HALL HAS RECENTLY BEEN        
 CONVERTED INTO FLATS.                 </content>
