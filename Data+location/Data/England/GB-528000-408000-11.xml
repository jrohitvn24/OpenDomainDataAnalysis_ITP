		<title>11GAMES WE PLAY</title>
		<content>  At school we like{skipping}. Whilst  
 we are doing this we sing, "Up to     
 Mississippi". Two people hold the end 
 of the rope while two or three people 
 skip. During this everyone is singing 
 "Up to Mississippi, miss a skip you're
 out". Another game we play is called  
{two  ball}. It is where you throw two 
 tennis balls, one at a time, against  
 the wall and catch them again. While  
 doing this you sing. One of the songs 
 we like is:                           
  "Robin Hood and his merry men,       
   went to school at half past ten,    
   teacher said, if your late again,   
   I'll smack you on your  B.U.M. "    
{Jacks}is a game where you have some   
 jacks and a power ball. Throw the ball
 up and pick up 1 jack at a time with  
 the same hand. Repeat, picking up 2   
 jacks each time,then 3 and so on until
 all have been picked up in one go.    </content>
