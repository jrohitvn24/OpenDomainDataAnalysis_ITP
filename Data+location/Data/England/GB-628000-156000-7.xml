		<title>07 GROVE MANOR FARM -THE MOAT</title>
		<content>  Mr Vincent told us about all the     
history of the farm.First he showed    
us a little island and all round it    
was a moat. He told us that when he    
was our age he had a tub of water with 
six goldfish but eventually the war    
broke out and he had to be evacuated   
to another town,so he poured the six   
goldfish into the moat and ever since  
then they have survived and now there  
are hundreds. Every night a heron comes
to the moat and takes one or two fish. 
  He also told us about the Danes.When 
they invaded,the people of the farm    
ran onto the island and lifted up the  
drawbridge.The Danes couldn't stay     
long because they had to leave with    
the next tide.At that time the sea came
right up to the farm. Sometimes they   
find shells in the soil still. Chequer 
Court,Ash,also has a moat which is now 
dry and there is a Moat Farm in Ash.   </content>
