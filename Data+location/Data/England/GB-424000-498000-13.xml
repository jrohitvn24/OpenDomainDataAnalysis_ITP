		<title>13SCORTON HOSPITAL</title>
		<content>                                       
   In 1912 the old Scorton manor house 
 was pulled down and a much larger     
 hospital was built on the site. During
 the demolition work,a priest's hole   
 was found.The hospital was a home for 
 poor cripples.It used to run its own  
 farm.Between the two World Wars there 
 was a school for young cripples.      
   In 1977 the Queen Mother opened the 
 new extension.That has a swimming pool
 and a gymnasium.                      
   The hospital costs a lot of money to
 run.Every year there is a Ball at     
 Scotch Corner Hotel which raises about
 Â£4,000.In shops and pubs all round    
 here there are collecting boxes where 
 people can put money.The collecting   
 boxes are made in the shape of Brother
 George because he goes round to       
 collect the money.
