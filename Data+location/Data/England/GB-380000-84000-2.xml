		<title>02EAST BURTON</title>
		<content> In the top North_East corner of our   
 map is Braytown,this is a residential 
 area of the town of Wool.Most of it   
 consists of modern bungalows though   
 nearby at Giddy Green there are       
 several older properties.These are    
 traditionally built of cob(clay,chalk 
 and straw mixture)and have thatched   
 roofs.Over the main Weymouth to London
 railway line is East Burton where     
 there are more bungalows,a telephone  
 box and a large farm house with brick 
 and flint walls.                      
 At East Burton the water meadows sweep
 across to the River Frome.These are   
 used as grazing for Fresian cows and  
 horses.Beyond East Burton is a large  
 inn'The Seven Stars'where members of  
 the Caravan Club can park.            
 At Burton Roundabout five roads meet  
 one of them leads to the Atomic Energy
 Establishment on Winfrith Heath.      </content>
