		<content> Alford 50 years ago.                  
 In{1935}it was very quiet in Alford.  
 All the  children went to one school  
 which is where the present{John       
{Spendluffe}is, except for some boys   
 who went to the{Grammar school.       
 The{market place}was only a little    
 different but had posts and chains    
 around it.There was a market every    
 Tuesday and Friday with{Banana Bob,   
{Rock King, fruit stalls etc.}Shops    
 generally were much smaller and there 
 were more family shops.               
 My Grandma lived in a small country   
 house with{no electricity, gas, piped 
{water or sewerage.}Her jobs were a    
{housemaid and a waitress.}For         
 entertainment she went to the picture 
 house at Enderby sale room.The special
 trip of the year was to{Mablethorpe}on
 a wagon pulled by horses. The railway 
 then went through Alford.             </content>
