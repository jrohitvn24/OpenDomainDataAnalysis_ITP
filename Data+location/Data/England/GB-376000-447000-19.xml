		<content> The Government tried to close the     
{village school}in 1982 when numbers on
 roll fell to 16 but public opinion was
 very strong and the school was saved  
 by the personal intervention of the   
 Education Minister.The school         
 population is however kept under      
 review and other small schools have   
 since closed.As there is very little  
 local employment,no new houses and    
 infrequent public transport it is not 
 surprising that the local population  
 is falling. The few houses for sale in
 the area are expensive for young house
 buyers.There is now only one shop     
 which is a Post Office and general    
 There is a strong feeling of community
 in the area.There are many clubs and  
 societies which are popular.The people
 are proud of the district and there is
 very little vandalism.
