		<title>03Deliveries In Greenhill</title>
		<content> Greenhill is a small hamlet on high   
 ground situated between Purton and    
 Wootton Bassett off the B4041. At the 
 present time (August 1985) there are  
 81 people living in the hamlet.       
    Despite being rather a long way    
 from the main road and bus route there
 is a good delivery service by the     
 local tradesmen. The milkman calls 5  
 days a week. The butcher and baker    
 call 3 times a week. The postman calls
 both for delivery and collection every
 day except Sunday. The inhabitants    
 also get a daily delivery of          
 newspapers.                           
    In an area like this, where there  
 are no shops, the regular visits of   
 tradespeople are of immense value.    
    In Greenhill 28 households own at  
 least one car and the nearest shops   
 are in Purton and Wootton Bassett.
