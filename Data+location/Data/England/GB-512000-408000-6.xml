		<title>06A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ZARA</title>
		<content> Hello.My name is Zara Fletcher and I  
 am 9 years old.Each morning I awake at
 7am, wash and have breakfast.My mum   
 drives me to the end of the lane where
 I pick up the school coach. The coach 
 arrives at school at about 8.30.      
 School begins at 8.45. We normally    
 begin the day with reading to         
 ourselves whilst the teacher hears the
 children read. Later we have assembly 
 and afterwards begin the day in       
 earnest.Normally we do such things as 
 English and Maths during the morning  
 and spend the afternoons doing        
 practical subjects such as            
 Science,Needlework,Art,Craft,Games and
 music. I like school very much and am 
 always sad when the school holidays   
 arrive as I have no friends to play   
 with at home. Sometimes we are given  
 homework to do. I enjoy homework. Most
 evenings I go swimming with my mother.</content>
