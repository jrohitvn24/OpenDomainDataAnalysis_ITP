		<title>07WILDLIFE OF FROXFIELD AREA</title>
		<content>  There are large numbers of animals in
 the area, and a bird population in    
 almost every hedge. These birds are   
 mostly common, and include tits,      
 thrushes, finches, and sparrows.      
 Sparrow-hawks and kestrels also live  
 in the region. Most of these birds    
 live on the edge of the woods, for a  
 greater food supply.                  
  Foxes in the area are very common,   
 and are concentrated in the woodland. 
 Badgers inhabit the sides of the steep
 scarps. Field mice, voles, and shrews 
 are found in the area, and even some  
 dormice, and these animals live in the
 open, scrubby wood.                   
  The most common deer in the area are 
 Fallow and Roe. Sika deer are quite   
 uncommon and a herd of red deer also  
 run through this area.
