{ }The residential area in this part of
 Billericay consists of older houses   
 (approx. 1930's) and the new estate   
 that is expanding rapidly.            
   The older{houses and bungalows}are  
 mainly detached each with its own     
 well_tended garden back and front.    
 Most of them have{garages.            
{ }The{flats}near the station are four 
 storeys high making them difficult    
 for elderly people and young mothers. 
 Children have no place to play. The   
 new{Queens Park Estate}is a rapidly   
 expanding area of houses and flats    
 built around cul_de_sacs. As land is  
 expensive the gardens are small but   
 the whole estate has been pleasantly  
 landscaped. The estate has no shops   
 except a large{supermarket.           </content>
