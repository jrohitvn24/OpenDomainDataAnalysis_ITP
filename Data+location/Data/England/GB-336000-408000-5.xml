   This block on the outskirts of      
Ormskirk is probably typical of a rural
area in that it has few of the         
amenities expected by most people      
today.  In our survey we found 2 'phone
boxes and 3 post boxes.  There is no   
post office.                           
   Although children living 3 miles    
from school catch a school 'bus, There 
is very little public transport.  We   
saw only 2 'bus stops.                 
   As there is no shop people either   
come into the town or rely on an       
occasional mobile shop or on having    
their goods delivered from the few     
shops still providing this service.    
Most people grow their own vegetables  
and we found that 4 farm shops sell    
their produce.
