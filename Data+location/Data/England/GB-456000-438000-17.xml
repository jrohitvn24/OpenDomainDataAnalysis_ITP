		<content>  The Cross Keys, public house, is     
 owned by Samuel Smith's brewery of    
 Tadcaster. The manager lives on the   
 premises.                             
  There is one bar where good bar meals
 are served daily. Regular customers   
 have one darts team in the winter     
 league, two in the summer and a ladies
 team. There are also two dominoes     
 teams.                                
  Recently the number of customers has 
 been increased by the opening of the  
 Stillingfleet coalmine.               
  For the enjoyment of the customers   
 there is a pool table, a juke box and 
 a fruit machine.
