		<content> This rural area has very few clubs    
 nearby. However people do have hobbies
 such as photography. For farmers there
 is a club where they can talk about   
 crops and livestock etc. The younger  
 population like to go to{nightclubs   
 and{discos}out of this area.          
 Shopping has become a major part in   
 the life of people. This area has very
 few shops so people shop in Thornbury 
 or Bristol. In Thornbury every        
 Saturday there is a{market}which has  
 a  variety of goods.                  
 The current fitness trend has caused  
 the nearby sports centre to be built. 
 Nowadays a treat is to eat at pubs or 
 restaurants which saves preparation   
 and serving of food.                  
{Summary}: People do not like to       
 mix work with pleasure.               
                                       
                                       </content>
