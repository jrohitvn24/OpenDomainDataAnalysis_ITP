		<title>18MARKET RASEN-HOUSING</title>
		<content> West Lindsey district Council(taking  
 its name from the pre-1974 county)    
 provides housing for the people of    
 Market and Middle Rasen(100 houses    
 inMkt.Rasen). Recently some have      
 passed into private ownership. There  
 are also warden-controlled bungalows  
 for the elderly on 2 sites in Market  
 and 1 in Middle Rasen.In the last     
 decade 2 new housing estates have     
 been developed and another enlarged.  
 The tendency is towards an influx of  
 people worknig out of town - in some  
 cases abroad.There remains the older  
 established ribbon development along  
 the main routes which has stretched   
 to the limits of the old Urban        
 District(pre-1974).There remains a    
 need for more council housing as there
 is waiting list of over 500.
