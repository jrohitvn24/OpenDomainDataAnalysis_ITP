		<title>15ROSE CASTLE: BISHOP'S HOME</title>
		<content>   Rose Castle has been the home of    
 the Carlisle Bishops since the        
 thirteenth century. It is built from a
 sandstone which is a "rose" colour,   
 which is probably why it is called    
 "Rose Castle", so the Bishop presumes;
 or he says that it maybe because it is
 so elegant like a rose.               
   Not all of the rooms are lived in   
 all the year round. The only time all 
 the bedrooms are used is when there is
 an ordination, because all the        
 prospective curates stay (with their  
 wives, if they are married) at the    
 Rose.                                 
   Rose Castle is open to the public   
 (with prior arrangement with the      
 Bishop) because it is of great beauty 
 and is of great historical value.
