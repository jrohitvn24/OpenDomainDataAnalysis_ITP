 The area is predominantly rural.      
 Agriculture, and particularly         
 horticulture, account for the majority
 of the land use. Most people, apart   
 from those working on the land,       
 commute to London or the surrounding  
 urban communities. The land undulates,
 and there is more woodland than in    
 other parts of Essex. An abandoned    
 railway line runs north to south. A   
 derelict church lies in the valley of 
 the River Blackwater. Gravel          
 extraction pits and two garages       
 constitute the main trade and         
 industry. The main A12 London to      
 Yarmouth road runs through the north  
 western part of the area. Generally it
 is a quiet district without a focal   
 point as it lies between two villages.
