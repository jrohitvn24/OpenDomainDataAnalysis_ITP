		<content>   The area around Catthorpe is divided
 between 5 farms,the largest of which  
 surrounds the village and was built in
 1882 as a model farm.All the farm     
 buildings and out-houses are covered  
 by the same preservation order as the 
 village.                              
   The farm land (which is disected by 
 the M1) is mainly arable covering 800 
 acres.A small plot of land was given  
 by the farmer to a local unemployed   
 villager who now has a growing        
 horticultural business.               
   The second largest farm is SSE of   
 the village and was originally part of
 "Kelmarsh,which has been drained,     
 providing grazing land for the farmers
 herd of cattle and pedigree flock of  
 sheep.                                
   The remaining three farms grow crops
 and have herds of animals.
