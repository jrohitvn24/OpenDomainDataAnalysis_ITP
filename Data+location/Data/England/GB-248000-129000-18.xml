 In the summer term the school has a   
 Sports Day.  Many events go to make up
 sports day with such things as Sack   
 races, Egg and Spoon races and Bean   
 Bag races as well as the more         
 conventional running and jumping      
 competitions.  Much practice is put in
 by each child before the day with even
 the youngest children playing a full  
 part.  A large number of parents and  
 friends come and watch and the whole  
 day is very enjoyable.  Later on in   
 that same term the school takes part  
 in an Area Sports meeting with three  
 other schools of a comparable size    
 with the most able of our athletes    
 representing the school.
