  Recently there was a survey carried  
out among the residents of the village.
It was about things people felt should 
be done. These are the results of      
things people felt very strongly about.
45 people wanted something done to     
   protect the grass verges.           
71 people felt very strongly that the  
   speed limit should be reduced from  
   40 miles an hour (64 km per hour) to
   30 miles an hour (48 km per hour).  
42 people felt very strongly that there
   should be a play area for the       
   children.                           
21 people felt very strongly that      
   something should be done to prevent 
   the stream from flooding onto the   
   road after very heavy rainfall.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
