		<content> The main industry is farming which    
 covers cereal growing and cattle and  
 sheep rearing, also a vineyard with   
 associated wine cellar, turf growing  
 for domestic gardens and a turkey farm
 which includes a farm shop selling    
 fresh and frozen meat. A supplier of  
 yachting equipment is housed in an old
 mill next to the railway station, and 
 various ropes and chains are visible  
 from the roadway. Close to the        
 reservoir is a workshop which at      
 present is partly occupied by a firm  
 undertaking kitchen and bedroom decor,
 while the remaining part is advertised
 to let. Tourism is an important       
 factor, hence three popular pubs all  
 serving food, and ample car parking   
 with picnic areas and public toilets  
 at the reservoir and at Abbots Wood   
 where an ice cream van is usually     
 present on summer afternoons.         </content>
