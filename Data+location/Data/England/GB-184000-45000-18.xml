		<title>18The Farmer's day in Summer 1</title>
		<content>   In the summer between milking I have
 various jobs such as check the cows   
 for disease check electric            
 fences,fertilise the fields cut the   
 silage as soon as possible,cut back   
 hedges, move electric fences so that  
 the cows can grase in a different part
 of the field.I let the calves out in  
 warm weather,and afterwards check them
 for disease.In the summer when I feed 
 them I give them 14% protein in       
 their milking food.The summer is      
 healthier,for cows because they are   
 out in the fields not in the yard.    
   In winter I have other different    
 jobs to do.I get up at 6.00am.to      
 milk the cows.the cows have to be     
 milked twice a day 365 days a         
 year.First I have to wash the cows    
 teets and connect them to the         
 machine.A cow eats 4 pounds of cow    
 pellets for every gallon of milk.     </content>
