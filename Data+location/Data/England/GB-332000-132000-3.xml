		<title>03WORKING ON THE LAND</title>
		<content>   Mr Roberts, a local dairy           
 farmer,talked to us about our area.   
 The soil is very good and has been    
 drained.Some is first grade {arable}  
 land, the rest excellent{pasture. }   
 Most farms here are small dairy       
 concerns, although, potatoes,sugar    
 beet, fodder beet, and cereals are    
 grown.                                
    The farms producing milk keep      
{Freisian}cows for maximum milk yields.
 Sheep have been tried but many drowned
 by falling into ditches.The Robert's  
 farm is 130 acres with 70 milking     
 cows. In the 19 years since he has    
 farmed here the number of dairy       
 concerns has dropped from 13 to       
 6.Mr Roberts still works 60 hours a   
 week and usually works all seven days.
 He says that automation has not       
 made his job easier, just more        
 efficient.                            </content>
