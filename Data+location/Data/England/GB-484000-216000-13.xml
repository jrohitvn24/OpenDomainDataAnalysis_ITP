     The land in our two squares is    
mostly Animal Farming ,in Rowsham      
there are two farms .Manor Farm and    
Home Farm both of these farm animals   
.The Masters Farm speciallises in      
poultry at Christmas time              
(Turkey,Chicken and goose).The Masters 
Farm employs quite a few farm          
labourers the actual farm house is     
very old probaly built in the          
seventeenth  century the house backs   
onto acres of rambling fields. Manor   
Farm is the other farm of which I spoke
it also farms mainly animals .The      
actual house has been bought by other  
people and now has nothing to do with  
the farm or its land .In the first     
paddock there are six big horsechestnut
trees where in autumn you can get the  
biggest conkers for miles around.      </content>
