		<title>05Ettingshall Park Farm Estate</title>
		<content>Our estate is very busy. It is bounded 
by Wolverhampton Rd. East and          
Birmingham New Rd. and has Dovedale    
Rd. crossing through it.  Mostly       
houses  and shops,there are two Primary
Schools,Spring Vale and Hill Avenue.   
The estate also has a recreation space 
and a piece of waste land that children
call the Canyon.   The Canyon is an old
opencast clay and coal pit very near to
the site of the Ettingshall Park farm  
now demolished. It has become a rubbish
tip and there are lots of motorbike    
riders using it. Some people have      
organised a petition in favour of      
turning the Canyon into a motor biking 
club track. Parts of the estate are    
untidy but in others it is neat. There 
are some large and well cared for      
gardens. Most of the gardens are well  
looked after and pretty. The houses    
are about sixteen to twenty years old. </content>
