		<content> The town of Wokingham is surrounded by
{arable and grazing land}. The area is 
 dominated by{transport routes},       
 largely in an East to West direction  
 viz.  M4, A329(M) and the Southern    
 Region Railway.  Large{housing estates
 have been built in the Embrook,       
 Crutchley Road, Bean Oak Road and     
 Woosehill areas.{Farms}have           
 amalgamated, rarely do we find tenant 
 farmers. Former{farmhouses}have been  
 sold purely for residential use.      
{Fields}are larger,{hedgerows}have been
 eradicated for economic purposes, to  
 the detriment of wildlife.            
 Architecturally Wokingham has two main
 buildings, the Old and New{Town Halls}
 and large buildings for{light industry
 appear in the Molly Millar's Lane     
 area. Denmark Street has been recently
 rebuilt in a new style in keeping with
 older structures.                     </content>
