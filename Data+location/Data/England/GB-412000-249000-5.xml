		<title>05NEW HOUSES IN WELFORD</title>
		<content> Mr Murphy uses modern building        
 methods.Traditional wood is used for  
 the wooden bits.Light weight bricks   
 are used on the inside,heavy duty     
 bricks are used on the outside to help
 for protection against very bad       
 weather.                              
 There will be a tarred road with      
 lots of little drives leading off to  
 each of the seven houses.             
  Each house will roughly cost Â£80,000 
  Before the houses were being built   
 there were some old houses, a few     
 cottages &amp; a shop. A man in the Isle  
 Of Wight owned the shop.              
  They had to obtain planning          
 permission for demolition &amp; building  
 before work proceeded.
