		<title>05The McNeill Family.</title>
		<content>  Julie and Martin McNeill have three  
 children - Donna, Kerry and baby John.
 Julie is a housewife, and even though 
 she finds this work dull, she is happy
 to do it for her family. She also     
 helps, regularly, at the Infants'     
 School.                               
  Martin works for an engineering firm.
 He is now installing a new heating    
 system at a Cirencester hospital.     
  The McNeills do not often go on      
 holiday, but they like going to France
 or Spain whenever possible. Julie     
 plays skittles with "Concorde" (a     
 local team) and loves gardening.      
  Martin likes to mend the car         
 occasionally.                         
  Sometimes, they play Scrabble or     
 Monopoly with the children. Donna, the
 eldest child, likes playing music, and
 gymnastics.                           
  They all like Tuffley very much.     </content>
