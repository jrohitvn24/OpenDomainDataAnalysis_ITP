		<content> At{Christmas}I looked in my stocking  
 in the middle of the night, but it was
 empty. Then I fell back to sleep and  
 in the morning there were many things 
 brought by Father Christmas. I took my
 stocking into Mummy and Daddy's room  
 to open it. There was a tape recorder,
 a computer, a chocolate orange, a box 
 of games and some Lego. More presents 
 were downstairs under the Christmas   
 tree. We went to{Church}and sang      
 Carols. The Church looked beautiful   
 with candles, flowers and Holly. Back 
 home we had a special lunch with roast
 turkey and potatoes, cranberry sauce, 
 broccoli, parsnips and lots more. For 
 dessert we had Christmas pudding (we  
 ate too much). After lunch we opened  
 the presents under the tree and went  
 for a walk. We had mince pies for tea 
 and I stayed up late playing with my  
 new toys.                             </content>
