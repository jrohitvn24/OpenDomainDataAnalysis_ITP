		<title>06EMPLOYMENT IN HARPUR HILL</title>
		<content>{                                      
 Unemployment in Britain as a whole is 
 about 4 million. In Buxton the rate is
 about 10% and young people find it    
 difficult to find jobs.               
 However, one young man from  Harpur   
 Hill has hit upon a solution.{Lynton  
{Bennett}of Heathfield Nook was on the 
 dole fo 2 years before he took        
 advantage of the{Enterprise Allowance}
 which gave him{Â£1000}to start his own 
 business and guaranteed him a wage of 
{Â£40}a week for the first year. This   
 gave Lynton the chance to start       
 selling vegetables in the streets     
 near his home this summer. The unusual
 thing about Lynton's business is that 
 he sells his green grocery from a     
 horse and cart. He delivers on        
 Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and  
 so far, has been very successful.
