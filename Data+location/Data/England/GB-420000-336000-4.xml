		<content> The post office in Longford is sixty  
 years old. The post mistress has      
 been the post mistress for four years.
 The person who owned the shop before  
 lived there for eighteen years. The   
 shop is part of the post office and   
 in the shop she sells food like fruit 
 and vegetables and ice cream. She     
 sells lots of fruit like lemons,      
 oranges, bananas, raisins, apples and 
 lots more. She also sells sweets and  
 pet food and house-hold things. The   
 customers leave their pets outside.   
 The old people come in for a chat     
 because they get lonely. The farmers  
 come on their tractors and have a     
 drink at harvest time. The post       
 mistess said one night the alarm went 
 off and she thought there were        
 burglars but when she went into the   
 post office it was only a fault on the
 alarm.                                </content>
