		<title>11LONG ASHTON VILLAGE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The old church was built in the       
 fourteenth century. Long Ashton is    
 lucky because we have three churches, 
 but this is the biggest. I expect it  
 could hold about three hundred people.
 The church has four rooms and two in  
 the tower, not including the boiler   
 room. Behind the church is a big      
 monument. This is called the Long     
 Ashton Cross. It is about ten feet    
 high, and about the same around the   
 base. The screen is one of the best in
 the south west of England. It is made 
 of oak and coated with gold. The      
 church also contains a striking       
 fifteenth-century monument in the Lady
 Chapel. The church has various        
 activities associated with it, like   
 bell-ringing and choir.
