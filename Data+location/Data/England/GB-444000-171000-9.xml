		<title>09ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content> Including the land for buildings and  
 drives the larger farm has 990 acres. 
 The majority of the land is loam      
 overlying chalk.Wheat and Barley      
 are the most profitable crops for soil
 type constituting a near monoculture  
 There are 220 acres of barley of      
 malting quality produced for lager;   
 260 of winter wheat for feed and 260  
 of spring barley.Quality is regarded  
 as more important than yield. There   
 are 3 workers instead of the former 27
 helping the farmer who keeps 1 combine
 harvester,3 large tractors and 1 small
 one.The combine harvester present cost
 Â£80,000,lasts about 6 years and the   
 tractors about Â£21,000 each,last about
 5 years.Â£145,000 p.a. is about the    
 average expenditure.The larger        
 hedgeless fields suit modern          
 mechanised methods but retain their   
 old names e.g.Clay hill.              </content>
