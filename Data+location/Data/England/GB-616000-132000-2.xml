		<title>02Ballet In Hythe.</title>

    In Hythe there is a ballet         
 school. It is not as well known as the
 Royal Ballet. It is held on a Friday  
 at the Cannon Newman Hall. The Cannon 
 Newman Hall is not just for ballet, it
 is used for Sunday School and things  
 like that. This ballet club is run by 
 Mrs Kennedy and has a helper called   
 Mrs Barnes. They also have a piano    
 player but I cannot remember her name.
                                       
                                       
    You wear a pink dress that is very 
 short and you wear a wrap around      
 cardigan that crosses in the middle.  
 You have about three quarters of an   
 hour for about 60p or something like  
 that. It is good for people that like 
 ballet.
