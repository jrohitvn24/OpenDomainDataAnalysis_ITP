		<title>02SCHOOLS IN HORLEY</title>
		<content>   Horley has two comprehensive        
{schools}for children aged 12-18, three
 middle schools, Yattendon, Court Lodge
 and Meath Green and four first schools
 one of which is still being built.    
 Children from Burstow First and Middle
 School attend the two comprehensives. 
 There are schools for children with   
 special educational needs in the area.
 Because of new housing developments in
 many parts of the town the over all   
 number of children is increasing due  
 to the situation of the new houses.   
 Many of the children will go to the   
 existing first school, and will go to 
 the new first school when it is       
 finished. Both schools will send their
 children on to Yattendon. At present  
 there are 301 children at Yattendon.  
 This number is much lower than it has 
 been and is  due to rise again.
