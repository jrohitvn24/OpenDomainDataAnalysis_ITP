		<title>13Tetchill Jubilee Celebration</title>
		<content>  Probably  the biggest event that  has
 happened  recently and  certainly  one
 that  we remember with  affection  was
 the  Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977.  
  This was an occasion  when the  whole
 community  got together  and  lots  of
 people  worked  very  hard  to make it
 a great success. A committee organised
 fund  raising   activities   over  the
 preceding year and the actual'do' took
 place at  Winston  Farm. A fun  sports
 meet was  held in the  afternoon  with
 events  ranging  from "wellie wanging"
 to running. A tea was organised in one
 of Mr.Sinker's barns,and,after it each
 child  was  given  a  special  jubilee
 crown (25p. piece).A quantity  of real
 ale was bought from  the Three Tuns at
 Bishop's Castle with  lemonade, sherry
 etc. for those who  did not  like  the
 beer.The evening was  spent in English
 folk dancing with a local band.       </content>
