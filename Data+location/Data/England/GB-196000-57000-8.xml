		<title>08FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Within the area, there was evidence of
 farmers cultivating their fields for  
{intensive grazing.}During the summer  
 period in which the survey was carried
 out,{hay and silage}were being cut.   
 On the higher ground where the fields 
 were more exposed to the weather, the 
 land was used for{rough grazing}of    
 bullocks and sheep.Here, stone walls  
 formed the boundaries, while in the   
 valleys, there were natural hedges.   
 There was no corn.The larger farms at 
 Gothers and Coldvreath had herds of   
 cows.The majority of farms were       
{small-holdings}with only a small but  
 varied number of animals that included
 goats, poultry-hens,geese,guinea-fowl 
 and turkeys for Christmas and pigs.   
 Farm machinery included tractors,     
 mowers,balers,manure-distributors,    
 rollers,discs,fertiliserspreaders     
 and chain-harvesters.                 </content>
