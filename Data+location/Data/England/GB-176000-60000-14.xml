		<content> On{Crantock Feast Day}everyone meets  
 in the Village Hall.  The band from   
 the neighbouring village of St. Newlyn
 East plays during the afternoon while 
 there are all sorts of competitions   
 going on, such as 'Glamorous Granny'  
 and 'Fancy Dress'.  All afternoon     
 there are races for different age     
 groups - especially children.  There  
 is a Feast Tea, 4.15 pm, a Slide Show 
 at 7.30 pm with pictures of Crantock &amp;
 Newquay and supper is at 9.00.  Prize 
 Bingo is played at 9.30 followed by   
 entertainment from Rod &amp; Jane, who are
 singers. {Crantock Parish Church} was 
 seriously damaged by fire and later   
 restored so in May the villagers held 
 a Concert of Thanks in the Church. The
 Newquay Male Voice Choir came along to
 sing.
