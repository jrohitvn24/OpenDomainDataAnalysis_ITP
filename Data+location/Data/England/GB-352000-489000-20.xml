		<content>          of{Tracy Archibald           
{ }On the 27th June 1985 some of the   
{Guides}and{Brownies}from the{1st      
{Natland Companies}met on platform one 
 of{Oxenholme Station}ready to meet the
 10.15 train. Our Guide leader, Mrs.   
 Usher,arrived bringing the 150        
 button-hole flower arrangements we    
 had made the day before. We planned to
 give them away to passengers          
 stepping off the train, as part of our
{75 years of Guiding celebrations;}to  
 get one all a person had to do was    
 smile! The 10.15 train did not provide
 us with all the customers we required 
 so we waited for the next one.        
  Most people were pleased to receive  
 the flowers but others were not so    
 polite. Most people cheered up when   
 they found out that their button-holes
 were not going to cost them any money!
