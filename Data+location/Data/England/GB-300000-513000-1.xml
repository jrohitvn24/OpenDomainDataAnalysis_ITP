		<content> The main town in the block is Cleator 
 Moor, surrounded by hills and         
 mountains. There are also two other   
 villages in the block, Moor Row and   
 Cleator.                              
                                       
 There are some lovely views of the    
 mountains of the Lake District and the
 River Ehen  in the block. There are   
 several hump-backed narrow bridges, a 
 ford and a seven arched aquaduct can  
 be accessed from the north west       
 corner.                               
                                       
 The town is not prosperous and        
 sometimes appears shabby and sleepy   
 but its residents are fiercely loyal. 
 People moving away often pine for home
 and return if possible.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
