		<title>02LANDSCAPE - CASTLE HEDINGHAM</title>
		<content>   The land surrounding the villages of
 Castle and Sible Hedingham is gently  
 rolling hills mainly used for arable  
 farming but with some woodland notably
 around the castle. The castle grounds 
 include a lake.                       
   The River Colne runs through the    
 area from North to South. It is a     
 small river here approx. 10-15 ft.    
 wide and quite shallow.               
   The roads are mainly narrow and     
 winding with the exception of the A604
 which carries heavy traffic through to
 the East coast ports.
