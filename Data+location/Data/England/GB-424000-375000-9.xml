		<title>09GRINDLEFORD'S ROAD HAZARDS</title>
		<content>                                       
           {WARNING                    
            =======                    
   Grindleford main road is a {hazard  
 for pets and for children.There is no 
 lollipop lady and we think that there 
 should be one.Sir William Hill is a   
 dangerous spot by our school and a    
 lorry has been through the school     
 playground wall.Now we have an extra  
 wall to protect pedestrians and us.   
       { GRINDLEFORD BRIDGE            
         =========== ======            
 The bridge in Grindleford can only    
 hold one way traffic and so they have 
 to have traffic lights.All this is    
 because of the new big lorries that   
 are using our main roads.The          
 Grindleford bridge is very old and    
 will not take the weight of two large 
 lorries on the bridge at the same     
 time.                                 </content>
