		<title>11Middle Brunton Farm</title>
		<content> Middle Brunton Farm was one of the    
 other farms we surveyed. The farm has 
 no{livestock}at all and the only crop 
 which is grown is wheat. We found that
 farmland and saw that the land was    
 fenced with barbed wire, strips of    
 woodand hedgerow. Typical farm        
 machinery is used on the farm, for    
 instance a combine harvester. As we   
 covered the land we did not find any  
 derelict land. No trees have been     
 planted or felled on any of the land  
 at Middle Brunton Farm.               
     All of the land at Middle Brunton 
 Farm is{cultivated}and there is a     
 small amount of game, such as         
 pheasants and rabbits etc.            
    Middle Brunton Farm has a very     
 modern farmhouse and surroundings.
