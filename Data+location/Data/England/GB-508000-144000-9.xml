 You play with a group of friends.     
 Someone is "Up" at the top of the     
 playground.  He or she has to think of
 a subject.  The people at the bottom  
 of the playground have to guess what  
 the subject is.  When they guess right
 they have to run up and down.The first
 person that gets to the top is "Up".  
                                       
 Hopscotch                             
 You need a small group of friends and 
 some squares drawn on the ground with 
 numbers one to ten.  You throw a stone
 and whatever number it lands on you   
 have to hop over one at a time.   Then
 you throw the stone again for the next
 number.                               
                                       
 Invaders
