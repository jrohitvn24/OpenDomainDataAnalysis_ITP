		<content> There is, in the village, Chescombe   
 Court, an Old People's Home run by the
 North Dorset District Council. Bingo  
 and Whist Drives are regularly held   
 there which attract many living else- 
 where in the village. A branch of the 
 Women's Institute meets weekly in the 
 Village Hall which is opposite the    
 School, They have talks on a wide     
 variety of subjects and have frequent 
 popular competitions testing the      
 housewife's skills. The Dart's Club   
 meet at the Milton Arms and the       
 Football Club play each season on a   
 West Farm Field. The Parish Council   
 meet each month to keep their fingers 
 on the pulse of the Village. Their    
 recent concerns have included the     
 future of the village School, the     
 protection of trees in the area, the  
 development of the Village and        
 excessive and dangerous traffic speeds</content>
