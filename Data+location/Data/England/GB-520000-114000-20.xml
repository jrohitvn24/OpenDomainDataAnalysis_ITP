		<title>20THE HIGH STREET HENFIELD.</title>
		<content>   The High Street is the shopping area
 of Henfield.  Probably the most       
 important shop in the Village is the  
 Post Office which is also a general   
 stores.  There is one supermarket and 
 two butchers.  There are two excellent
 bakeries which bake on the premises   
 There is a chemist which is important 
 especially to the old people. There   
 are greengrocers, fresh fish shop and 
 one hardware store.  There are        
 several banks and building societies. 
 There are also clothes shops and      
 newagents, in fact you don't really   
 have to leave the Village to go       
 shopping.  Many villagers however     
 prefer to do their main shop in the   
 nearby larger towns because it is     
 cheaper.  There are antique and gift  
 shops and a Gun shop for those who    
 like sport.  The smithy still works   
 and it is fun to watch the blacksmith.</content>
