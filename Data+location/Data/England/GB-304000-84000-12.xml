		<content>Of the working population,the majority 
commute to work in Budleigh Salterton  
2.5km to the south,Exmouth 7.5km to the
S.W or Exeter about 17km to the        
N.W.Most travel by car,especially as   
Public Transport services have         
declined over the years,and most work  
in the Tertiary sector,in shops and    
offices. Rolle College in Exmouth,     
Bicton College of Agriculture and      
Exeter University provide employment   
in education in the East Devon area.   
Seasonal incomes are obtained from     
tourist services such as cream-teas.   
Bicton Gardens and Otterton Mill.      
These service industries have provided 
employment to replace jobs lost with   
increased mechanisation in agriculture 
and have been of additional importance 
when one considers the small           
manufacturing base in the area.
