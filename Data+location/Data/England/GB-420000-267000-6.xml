		<content>Poultry Farming                        
A poultry farm is situated near Five   
Ways cafe.It is its eighth year in     
production, and employs 40 labourers.It
has 12 contract sites around Britain.  
They buy some chicks at two days old   
and they breed others to be slaughtered
at seven weeks.  The chickens are dist-
ributed locally and nationally by 6    
lorries, 3 vans and 5 cars owned by the
farm.                                  
Dairy Farming                          
All dairy farmers have to go by the EEC
milk quota.  This means that farmers   
have to reduce their cattle numbers.   
Some farmers are given special         
permission by the M.M.B.  If the farmer
produces one litre over the milk quota 
he will be fined 17 pence.             
Crop Farming                           
There was also a considerable amount of
wheat and barley grown locally.        </content>
