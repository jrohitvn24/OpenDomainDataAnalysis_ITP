		<title>20NEW SCHOOL/COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>

In 1983 it was decided to build a new  
school and as the Community Council    
wanted to build a Community Centre it  
was agreed to have them both as one    
building.  Part of the playing field   
was sold to the County Council and     
work started in July 1985.  It is      
expected to take 15 months to finish   
the building.  The new school will have
three classrooms, an activity area for 
doing messy things, a library and rooms
for the teachers.  The big hall will be
shared by the school and the Community 
Council.  It will be used by the school
during the day and the Community       
Council will use it during the         
evenings, weekends and sometimes during
the day.  They will have their own     
kitchen and bar, changing rooms and    
cloakrooms.
