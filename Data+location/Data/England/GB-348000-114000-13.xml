 downstairs. It has ten barns and      
 sheds,one big barn, one dairy parlour,
 two cattle sheds, five storage sheds  
 and one barn which they hardly use.   
 They buy 3 tons of cattle cake in the 
 winter. They have 1 pet cat and 5     
 working cats. They used to have lots  
 of dogs, but they all got run over on 
 the main road, out side the farm.     
 They make 30 tons of beef a year.

 products, but they had to stop because
 the cattle were dying of a disease.
