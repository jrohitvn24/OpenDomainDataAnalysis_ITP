		<title>20LITTLE WENLOCK</title>
		<content> L. Wenlock is a village on a hill. A  
 14 year old resident, Graham Tart,    
 said of it, in the winter:            
  "It is often cut off, but is soon dug
 out of the snow, by the farmers who   
 live in and around it."               
 More ominously he says that the       
 village is surrounded by " a radius   
 of countryside, of 1.5 miles, which   
 seems to be getting smaller as Telford
 gets bigger."                         
 An 80 year old resident of L. Wenlock,
 Mrs. Goodall, remarked that she didn't
 think it was a village 'anymore'. When
 she was a girl, back in the 1920's,   
 her family had a 'pony and float'.    
 Nowadays, most houses have at least   
 one car. The roads into the village   
 may still be narrow and windy, but the
 M54's proximity, encourages commuters 
 to Birmingham, and hikers who descend 
 on the village in summer.             </content>
