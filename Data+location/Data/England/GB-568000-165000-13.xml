  Cuxton Marina opened in 1983. It has 
 space for 160 boats. It costs Â£22 per 
 foot per year. So if you had a boat   
 ten feet long it would cost Â£220. The 
 pontoon is 1,000 metres long.         
 Everything that is attached to the    
 pontoon floats with the tide. The     
 pontoon moves up and down 4 metres    
 between tides. The piles are 12 metres
 deep and keep the pontoon from        
 floating away. As well as selling     
 boats, the Marina sells spare parts.  
 You can buy a boat called the Sea     
 Warrior 27 for Â£25,000. There are 2   
 ways of mooring a boat. The first is  
 trot mooring, using buoys. The second 
 is along the pontoon. There are often 
 collisions because a boat is much     
 harder to steer than a car as a boat  
 moves sideways.
