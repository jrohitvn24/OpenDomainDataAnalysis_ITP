		<title>16 CUDHAM - RECREATION GROUND</title>
		<content> Cudham Recreation Ground is situated  
in the centre of the village and has   
been used for this purpose since 1938. 
The children's swings and car park have
been there from the beginning and the  
tennis courts were added after the 2nd 
World War.                             
 There are 5 points of access ,one for 
vehicles, an enclosed children's play- 
ground, pavilion, tennis court, cricket
square, and 2 football pitches. The    
rec. is owned by the London Borough of 
Bromley who employ two groundsmen for  
35 hour per week.  They keep the ground
in good condition and mark out the     
sports pitches. The recreation ground  
covers an area of 10 acres with a      
perimeter of 802 metres.               
  The pitches are hired by local sports
clubs and also used by the village     
school.  Cricket on the "village green"
is a popular summer attraction.        </content>
