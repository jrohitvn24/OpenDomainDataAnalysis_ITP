		<title>13EAST HETTON COLLIERY</title>
		<content>                 Known as Kelloe Pit,  
 it was a working colliery.G.R 345 370.
 Now all that remains are some surface 
 buildings and the heaps.The heaps are 
 going to be flattened out soon.Most of
 the buildings have been knocked down  
 and there are only bricks left.The    
 machines have been salvaged.The only  
 buildings working are the washeries.  
 The colliery has a history of floding.
 In 1983 the colliery was developing a 
 new seam, It was underneath the Tilley
 Seam which belonged to the now closed 
 Thornley Colliery.When they started   
 drilling, water began coming through  
 the hole.The officials were worried.  
 They withdrew the men from the seams. 
 East Hetton Colliery was closed.Some  
 of the men were transferred to coastal
 collieries.At our school we are hoping
 to set up a museum.We have got        
 tools,photographs and other documents.</content>
