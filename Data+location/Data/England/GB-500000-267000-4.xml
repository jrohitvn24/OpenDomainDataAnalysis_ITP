		<content> The Dustcart collects household       
 rubbish once a week and leaves 2 large
 plastic sacks per house. Periodically 
 a large skip is placed in the village 
 for the disposal of large unwanted    
 things. (most of the things that are  
 thrown away by one person are         
 hurriedly retrieved by somebody else!)
 The Mobile Library from Kempston calls
 once every 2 weeks with a selection of
 books which may be borrowed free of   
 charge. Specific books if not         
 available may be ordered for a charge 
 of 13p each. The van also displays    
 information on places of interest,    
 education, evening classes and        
 entertainment in the area.            
 Medical attention can be sought from  
 Sharnbrook or Rushden. Sharnbrook     
 patients are referred to Bedford or   
 Huntingdon Hospitals and Rushden,     
 Kettering,northampton, Wellingborough.</content>
