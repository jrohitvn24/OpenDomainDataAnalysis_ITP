		<content> The major land uses of the area       
 produce 3 major habitat types:  mixed 
 grassland, hedgerows and small mixed  
 woodlands, and rough pasture/woodland 
 type on the disused airfield.         
 Unfortunately the relatively intensive
 land use means that there are field   
 species living in the grassland and   
 that although lapwing are common other
 plovers are less so.  The hedgerows   
 are however well preserved and small  
 coppices maintained to provide        
 habitat for foxes.  The major tree    
 species since the death of many elms  
 with Dutch elm disease is now ash.    
 There few oaks and willows and beech  
 is found around Peatling Parva.  The  
 hedges usually contain many species;  
 hawthorn, blackthorn, field maple,    
 ash, willow and hazel.
