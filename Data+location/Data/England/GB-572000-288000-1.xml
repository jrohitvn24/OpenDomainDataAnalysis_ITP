 This block covers a rural area, the   
 majority of which is arable farm-land.
 It rises from a river valley 1/2 mile 
 away, to not more than 50 ft. above   
 sea level. To the south is the village
 of Hockwold-cum-Wilton with a         
 population of approx. 1000, living in 
 about 410 houses. On the Western      
 boundary is a B class road, much used 
 by American Servicemen commuting      
 between Feltwell and Lakenheath Air-  
 bases. To the East is an area of      
 coniferous forest, owned and          
 supervised by the Forestry Commission,
 a Government sponsored body. The farm-
 land is mainly owner occupied in units
 of 50-300 acres. The majority of      
 houses are also owner occupied, though
 there are 62 owned by the Borough     
 Council.On most days there is frequent
 air activity by USA planes.           </content>
