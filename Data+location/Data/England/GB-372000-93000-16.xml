		<title>16LOCAL ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>  Although Puddletown is quite a       
 small place it has many clubs and     
 activities to offer.The church runs   
 some of these activities and villagers
 organise others.                      
  The activities are varied enough to  
 cater for all age groups.For the young
 girls there are the majorettes who    
 meet once a week and also take part in
 contests or give exhibitions nearly   
 every Saturday.They have been going   
 for about eight years.                
  There are also the packs of cubs,    
 brownies and guides.The local youth   
 club provides table games and other   
 activities.The church organises the   
 Sunday club,the pathfinders and the   
 Puddleuppers(for 14 to 18 age groups).
  For young and old alike there are    
 regular meetings of the tap dancing   
 and keep fit classes.There is also a  
 Gardening Club for the less energetic.</content>
