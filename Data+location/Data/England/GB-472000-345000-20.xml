		<content> Because of the lack of facilities,    
 most newcomers to the villages have   
 made a conscious decision to live here
 and so there is a high level of car   
 ownership. There is a general pride in
 the appearance of the villages and in 
 retaining their characters. Many of   
 the teenagers may not enjoy their     
 lives as there is so little for them  
 to do, but the other residents seem to
 enjoy living here.
