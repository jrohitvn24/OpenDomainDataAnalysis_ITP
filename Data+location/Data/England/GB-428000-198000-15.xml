 Although on the edge of the Cotswolds 
this immediate area, being part of the 
Upper Thames Valley is quite flat. The 
fields alongside the river are liable  
to flood and careful maintainance of   
the banks is necessary. Being an area  
of mainly arable land it is composed of
fields surrounded by hedgerows.        
 The River Thames and belts of         
deciduous woodland add to the beauty of
the area, electricity pylons however do
spoil the view.                        
 The soil near the Thames is fertile   
silt but on the higher parts it is     
well drained red loam on gravel. Annual
rainfall varies from 19ins to 27ins.   
 The landscape lends itself to various 
sporting activities. Sheepdog trials   
are held annually at one farm; the Old 
Berks Hunt rides across the area and   
Radley College Beagles hunt for hares. </content>
