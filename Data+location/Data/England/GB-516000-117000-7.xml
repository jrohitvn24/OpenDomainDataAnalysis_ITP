		<content> My name is NICOLA HUTTON.We have lived
 in a 3 bedroom terrace house in the   
 High Street since I was born 10 years 
 ago.My grand parents live nearby.Only 
 3 years ago my sister was born.My dad 
 is a butcher and works for Mr.Mitchell
 in his long established shop almost   
 next door to our house.He gets up     
 first at 6.45am. and makes the        
 tea.After a bowl of cereal he starts  
 work at 7.30am.He likes               
 birdspotting,shooting and walking.Mum 
 works part time in the afternoons as  
 an office cleaner on the industrial   
 estate.She enjoys knitting and keeping
 house plants.She shops in Partridge   
 Green.At weekends we go swimming and  
 in the summer have picnics.Our        
 favourite family meal is steak,onions 
 and mashed potatoes.
