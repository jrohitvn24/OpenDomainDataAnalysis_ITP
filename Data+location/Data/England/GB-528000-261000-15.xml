		<content> Elsworth has two Public Houses, both  
 of which serve meals and attract      
 visitors from outside the area. There 
 is also a restaurant.                 
                                       
 Papworth Everard has a social club    
 which is linked to the Settlement.    
                                       
 There is a mobile library which visits
 both villages.                        
                                       
 Both villages have sports and         
 recreation grounds.                   
                                       
 In the case of Elsworth much of the   
 recreation tends to be either         
 home-based or found outside the       
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
