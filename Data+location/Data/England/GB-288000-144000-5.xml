 West Luccombe is a 300 acre farm      
 rented from the{National Trust.}The   
 farmer who rents it also owns Lucott  
 Farm where the animals are kept in    
 summer.He lets this farm house for    
 holiday accommodation and his wife    
 does bed and breakfast at Luccombe.   
 The farmer keeps about 1000{Exmoor    
{Horn sheep}changing 250 ewes each     
 year.They also keep Devon Charolais   
 cross beef cattle which are sold at   
{Cutcombe}market.200 acres are arable  
 with 100 acres{malting barley}and 100 
 acres mowing grass.They do not have   
 much modern equipment because of      
 expense only tractors are kept;other  
 mechanical work is done by{contractors
 A new barley store and drying unit has
 recently been built.Their greatest    
 anxiety is the uncertainty of the     
 future of farming.                    </content>
