		<content> Although most people work outside the 
 villages, there is still some         
 employment to be found at the cement  
 quarries near Totternhoe and in the   
 villages.                             
    Richard Grant's factory in Eaton   
 Bray employs nearly 80 people, approx 
 half of whom are local, making car    
 accessories which are exported to all 
 parts of the world. Nearby, Paddy     
 Hopkirk's Motor Accessories factory at
 Two Counties Mill, employs about 96   
 people, again half of them local,     
 making petrol cans, dog guards and    
 roof racks for home and export.       
    Several garages in the area, one of
 which is the largest sales and spares 
 centre for Jeeps in the UK, employ    
 people in sales and maintenance. Part 
 time work, mainly for women, is found 
 in public houses and their attached   
 restaurants and village shops.        </content>
