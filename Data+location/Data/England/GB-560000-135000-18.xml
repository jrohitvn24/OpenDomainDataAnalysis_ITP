		<content>  Marshall Farmer is a{skin and hide   
 merchants.  They collect hides all    
 over the South-East every day from    
 abattoirs.  Altogether they collect   
{25,000 sheep skins}a week and 1500    
 hides from  cattle.   The hides are   
 salted and graded, because it kills   
 bacteria.   The skins go to other     
 companies to be turned into leather   
{coats and shoes. } Most shoe leather  
 comes from sheep, because ox leather  
 cost 5 times more than sheep.  Ox     
 hides are used for{furnishing and     
{leather soles. } Wool from skins is   
 removed at fellmongers with a chemical
 process.   The nearest competitor is  
 probably in North London.   Skins are 
 exported to{Spain and Italy,}both of  
 whom prefer the skin with the wool    
 already removed.   Sheepskin dusters  
 and rugs are exported to{Germany.     
  The factory has a very strong smell. </content>
