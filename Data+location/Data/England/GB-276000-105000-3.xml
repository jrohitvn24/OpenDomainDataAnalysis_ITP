		<title>03Morchard Bishop's population</title>
		<content> When the main turnpike road to        
 Barnstaple passed through the village 
 there were approximately 2000 people, 
 now there are only half that number.  
 Now there is a good cross-section of  
 population.Some have lived here all   
 their lives,others returned after     
 being evacuated here during the war.  
 Pensioners have come here to retire,  
 some because of harassment in London  
 or just to enjoy the countryside.The  
 oldest resident is a lady of 96.Young 
 families contribute to the flourishing
 "playgroup".Teachers and others       
 commute to neighbouring towns,but some
 find the cost of travelling too high  
 and move away.Owing to the varying    
 nature of their jobs,it is not now    
 quite such a close knit community.    
 Family farms use their own labour     
 though some daughters work away.
