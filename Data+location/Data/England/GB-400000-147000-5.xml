		<content> On Christmas day my Nan and Granddad  
 came to our house. We opened our      
 presents in the afternoon. I had a    
 Lego construction kit. On Boxing Day  
 we went to my Nan's. My cousins went  
 to my Nan's too. We played hide and   
 seek. We had dinner. We were playing  
 on the computer. We pulled some       
 crackers. We had tea and played hide  
 and seek again. We went home in the   
 car after that and went to bed. The   
 next morning I helped my Granddad     
 clean out the pigs and my brush nearly
 went down the pit. I'm going to have  
 my computer in my own room. I'm in my 
 sister's room now. My Granddad owns a 
 farm. We take the pigs to the market  
 where they are killed and then sent to
 the butcher. Sometimes we eat our own 
 pigs but they have to be slaughtered  
 at Salisbury.                         
                                       </content>
