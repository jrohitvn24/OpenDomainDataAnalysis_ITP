		<content> Most of the land in our area is used  
 for farming.Cattle graze out on the   
 moors. The farmers make silage for    
 winter feed.They also make hay.       
 Silage is made before hay making      
 time.After the grass has been cut and 
 gathered it is put into a silage pit. 
 This is not really a pit but an       
 enormous box.When it is full it is    
 covered with a huge plastic sheet to  
 keep the weather out.On top of the    
 plastic sheet you put old tyres to    
 weight it down.                       
 Hay making needs good weather.After   
 the hay has been cut it has to be     
 turned with a machine called a hay    
 bob.Then the bailer comes along and   
 gathers it up into bails tied with    
 string.The bails have to be taken away
 to be stored.Loading up the trailer is
 very heavy work.
