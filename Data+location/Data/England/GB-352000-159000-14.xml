		<title>14Water - Chew Valley Lake</title>
		<content> One of six largest reservoirs in the  
 country, the Chew Valley Lake has a   
 capacity of about 5m gallons. A dam   
 was constructed across the valley of  
 the River Chew at Chew Stoke and the  
 river diverted. The Lake extends for  
 well over 2 miles along the valley. In
 order to preserve everthing possible  
 of historic interest, the whole area  
 was very carefully photographed;      
 records of old farmhouses have  been  
 preserved and Stratford Mill was taken
 down and re-erected in the grounds of 
 Blaise Castle and is still in working 
 order with its original machinery.    
 Around the Reservoir and on the Denny 
 Island many types of trees have been  
 planted so the the Lakes blend with   
 the surroundings and anyone coming to 
 the area in 1985 would assume that    
 they have always been here. People    
 from far afield come for recreation.  </content>
