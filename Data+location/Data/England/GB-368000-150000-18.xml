		<content> Change in the area has been gentle,   
 but inevitably the older generation   
 who worked all their lives for the    
 Estate feel some loss of security.    
 Rents have risen with the cost of     
 modernising and both old and young    
 worry that the cost of buying or      
 renting their homes is increasingly   
 beyond their means. Few resent        
 newcomers, who have integrated well.  
 The village means just as much to     
 them. They join in whatever is going  
 on and add rather than otherwise to   
 the "family spirit" of the parish. It 
 is a happy and caring community. The  
 mental isolation suffered by so many  
 city dwellers living alone has never  
 been a problem.
