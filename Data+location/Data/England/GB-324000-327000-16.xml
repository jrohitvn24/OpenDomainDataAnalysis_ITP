		<content> MRS GLADYS DAVIES LIVES AT BROOK      
 COTTAGE IN THE HAMLET OF CANDY SOME   
 TWO MILES FROM THE MARKET TOWN OF     
 OSWESTRY.                             
                                       
 MRS DAVIES WAS BORN IN LIVERPOOL      
 AND HAS LIVED IN CANDY FOR ABOUT 20   
 YEARS.                                
                                       
 THE GREATEST CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY  
 THAT MRS DAVIES HAS NOTICED OVER THE  
 YEARS IS THAT THERE ARE NOW LESS      
 FAMILIES LIVING IN THE AREA WHO HAVE  
 LOCAL ROOTS. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE    
 LIVING IN THE HAMLET WHO HAVE MOVED   
 FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTY AND    
 COUNTRY.                              
                                       
 MRS DAVIES WRITES CHILDREN'S STORIES  
 FOR RADIO AND ALSO WRITES ARTICLES FOR
 MAGAZINES SUCH AS{SHROPSHIRE}MAGAZINE.
