		<title>12ROXWELL CATTERY</title>
		<content> The cattery at Roxwell is quite small.
 The owner, Tony Dobson first lived in 
 the countryside and grew fond of      
 animals, then he went to work in      
 industry. However he disliked it so   
 moved back into the country and bought
 the business.There are 35 cats at the 
 cattery and you have to hold a licence
 to say the cat has had all of its     
 required innoculations before you can 
 leave your cat there. The cats have   
 either inside or outside runs         
 depending on personal preference of   
 the owner. The types of food they are 
 given depend on their state of health 
 for an ill cat would be given food    
 with increased Vitamin C. The cats are
 fed a number of different meals in a  
 day and the number varies according to
 the age of the cat.
