		<content> Hoarwithy is a pretty rural riverside 
 village with cottages and houses built
 into the bank overlooking the River   
 Wye.The Italian style Church built in 
 the 1880s provides an                 
 unusualfeature,where the congregation 
 attend a monthly service.The Wye is   
 crossed here by a Victorian iron      
 bridge with its former angular toll   
 house standing alongside.There has    
 been little recent development,but    
 older properties have been extended   
 and improved.Small farms surround the 
 village which has become popular for  
 holiday cottages and retirement       
 homes.With decline in population and  
 easier mobility many services and     
 activities have gone,but there is a   
 builder,an inn,guest house,farm       
 offering B/B,a post office and flower 
 club.A DR. surgery is held twice      
 weekly,and the m/library calls monthly</content>
