		<content> A{small-holding}of {37 acres}         
 originally part of the Lanhydrock     
 Estate. The present owner, of 12 years
 standing, could not make a living     
 except by farming intensively of which
 she does not approve.Hence it was     
 opened 9 years ago as a {farm park}   
 where visitors can see a small farm   
 worked by traditional methods. It is  
 open mid-May until the end of         
 September, 6 days a week and attracts 
 an average of 180 people a day.It is  
 advertised locally in newspapers,on   
 television and in tourist information 
 centres. The only crop is hay, animal 
 feed being bought from a neighbour.   
 Milk cannot be sold,as there is no    
 tanker access,but is used to prepare  
 dairy products which are sold in the  
 farm shop and the skimmed milk fed to 
 pigs.
