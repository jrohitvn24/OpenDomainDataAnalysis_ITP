		<content>  Leebotwood is the largest village in 
 this area with the widest variety of  
 houses.These range from old timbered  
 buildings to very modern houses and   
 bungalows.The village has a shop,a    
 Post Office and the Pound Inn, all    
 situated beside the A.49 which runs   
 right through Leebotwood and is seen  
 as a hazard to children and the       
 elderly.                              
  Mains water and electricity are      
 available and most homes have modern  
 equipment such as electric cookers,   
 freezers,fridges and television.There 
 is no mains drainage and septic tanks 
 are widely used.There is a small new  
 estate with its own drainage system.  
 Mains gas is not available.           
  Many villagers work on farms, some   
 commute to nearby towns but unemploy- 
 ment is a problem for young people.The
 population is mainly elderly.         </content>
