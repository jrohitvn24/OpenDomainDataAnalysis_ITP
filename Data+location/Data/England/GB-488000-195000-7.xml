		<title>07H.GREEN &amp; HAZLEMERE HISTORY</title>
		<content>Holmer Green comes from the word       
"holmere" which means a "mere" in a    
hollow,(pond).Some street names tell us
about local history,e.g. trades.The    
Saw-pit,used by the chairmaking        
industry, is now Saw-pit Hill.The wood 
for chairmaking came from Beech Tree   
Road.Sir Cecil Clementi, the Governor  
of Hong Kong and Malaya, lived in      
Holmer Court, Clementi Avenue was named
after him.The famous artist Rossetti   
and his poet sister Christina stayed in
Polidoris Lane with their              
grandparents,hence,Rossetti Place.     
Windmill Lane, where the windmill      
stood,is where the villagers used to   
grind their grain.Orchard End,Orchard  
Park,Orchard Way and Cherry Grove are  
named after the fruit growing tradition
of the village.Hazlemere means Hazle   
fringed pool.The first document        
mentioning this was in the 13th century</content>
