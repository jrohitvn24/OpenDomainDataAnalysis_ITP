		<title>19LIFE IN STAINTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> My home is in Stainton Village and my 
 family and I are very happy living    
 there.It is a nice open place with    
 lots of green fields with cows,sheep, 
 goats,ducks and hens in them.We have a
 recreation area with swings,slides and
 a rocking horse.We have no shops so I 
 have to go to Barnard Castle or       
 Stainton Grove to spend my Â£2 pocket  
 money.I go to school in Barnard Castle
 so I travel on the school bus.In the  
 village hall there is Bingo and Keep  
 Fit classes, and sometimes a disco,but
 I don't go very often.There is not    
 even a pub in Stainton so if my Mam   
 wants to go out for a drink with her  
 friends, she to go by car or use the  
 service bus.I have to use my bike or  
 I walk.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
