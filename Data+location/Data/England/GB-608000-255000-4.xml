		<title>04A Typical Farm in Creeting</title>
		<content>                                       
     On June 11th, we visited Mr.      
******'s farm. He has got 130 acres in 
Creeting St. Mary and 60 acres in      
Needham Market. He grows wheat and     
barley.                                
     Mr. ****** has got about 400 pigs.
He showed us what they eat. First of   
all there was ground barley. Then he   
showed us middlings which was like     
bran. He also added concentrate.       
     Then we went to see the piggeries.
Anna asked why the pigs' tails were    
short, and he replied because otherwise
they would bite each others off.  Mr.  
****** buys the pigs when they are ten 
weeks old and fattens them up for ten  
weeks.  Then they go to the slaughter  
to be made into ham, pork, bacon and   
sausages. The young pigs are called    
weaners or store pigs and the pigs     
going for slaughter, cutters.          </content>
