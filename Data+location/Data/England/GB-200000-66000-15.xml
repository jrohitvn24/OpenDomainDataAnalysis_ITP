		<title>15FEARS FOR THE FUTURE</title>
		<content> Village people would like the present 
 situation to continue.They like       
 Nanstallon as it is,but fear further  
 building will come and Bodmin will    
 spread to engulf it.Most express fear 
 of anything nuclear,war,waste,        
 accident.Worry is caused by the long  
 term effect of pollution of air and   
 sea.This with large scale clearance of
 forests could dangerously affect the  
 climate.The Earth's resources are     
 being carelessly wasted.Population    
 growth threatens land and facilities. 
 People are afraid of violence and     
 terrorism.Some do not like opening    
 their doors at night.Young people fear
 computers will mean more unemployment,
 parents worry about drugs and         
 promiscuity,old folk loneliness and   
 loss of mobility.Few seem to worry    
 about money,but cancer is still a     
 bogey.                                </content>
