		<title>15SHOPPING, RUGELEY</title>
		<content> Rugeley is situated in rural          
 Staffordshire in the Trent Valley some
 8 miles from the nearest substantial  
 towns. It is cut off from the West    
 Midlands conurbation by Cannock Chase.
 Hence the town serves local needs for 
 basic food, hardware and clothes.     
 Supermarkets provide a restricted     
 range of food and other goods at low  
 prices. Most shops in Rugeley are     
 small family businesses occupying the 
 narrow streets and two squares in the 
 town centre. There is a discount      
 furniture warehouse, carpet warehouse 
 and large DIY store belonging to      
 national chains. However many people  
 are willing to travel to Lichfield,   
 Stoke, Stafford and Birmingham to shop
 for more expensive items. The village 
 of Colton, 2 miles from Rugeley, has  
 only one shop which is a general store
 and incorporates a sub-post office.   </content>
