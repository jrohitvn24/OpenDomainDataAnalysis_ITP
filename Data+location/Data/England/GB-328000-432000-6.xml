		<content> Blackpool is probably Britain's       
 leading resort which entertains       
 millions of visitors each year.  The  
 town is geared to the holiday         
 industry, with little else in the way 
 of employment, and is dominated by    
 hotels, guest houses and shops and    
 facilities to cater for its visitors. 
 The sea front extends for a five mile 
 stretch, and caters for every one -   
 with a tower, three piers and a large 
 pleasure-beach dominating the front.  
 The season is extended by the         
 "Illuminations" which carry on until  
 late October, and insures Blackpool is
 busy long after other holiday resorts 
 are empty.  Blackpool, like many      
 holiday resorts, has a high percentage
 of pensioners as many people have     
 moved into the area to enjoy their    
 retirement here.
