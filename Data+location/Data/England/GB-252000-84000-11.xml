		<title>11The Buzzards</title>
		<content>   Coming down from {Wallabrook Head } 
 along the Wallabrook I passed{Doetor  
{Farm.}On the other side of the brook  
 was a dead pine tree, and perched on  
 one of the branches was a buzzard.    
   I had often seen the buzzards on    
 Dartmoor, but this was the closest I  
 had come to one, usually they are     
 soaring on the thermals.              
   With a mew this buzzard took flight,
 and skimmed down over my head, so     
 close I could see the individual      
 feathers. Another cry came from the   
 sky, and there was its mate. The two  
 great birds circled overhead, then    
 returned to their perch.              
   Master of the skies, these birds    
 will always be a source of wonder and 
 envy. Their very freedom is an        
 indictment of the prison we put       
 ourselves in. Long may they live on   
 Dartmoor.                             </content>
