		<content>       My Dad's Farm by Karen.         
   My dad is a farming contractor.  On 
 our farm we have got lots of animals  
 such as calves, cows, sheep, lambs,   
 chickens and we have one border-collie
 sheep dog.  My Dad has plenty of      
 different farm machinery including    
 some different sorts of tractors.  My 
 Dad keeps silage, hay, straw, beans   
 and corn.                             
       Barrow Hill Farm by Kirsty.     
   On our farm there is a shop but we  
 only sell organic produce.  We have   
 geese, chickens, dogs, goats, a       
 donkey, cows, cats, sheep, pigs and   
 calves.  We have a few tractors, two  
 combines, a harvester and other       
 machines.  The buildings are the      
 granary, mill house, egg shed, Sussex 
 Barn, Tin Barn, Goat Shed, pig-sty and
 the shop.  Some people come and help  
 us on the farm.                       </content>
