		<content>     My brother goes to{William Parker 
 School.He is seventeen years old.He is
 doing French, Latin and History       
 A_Levels this month.He spends two and 
 a half hours a day studying.He thinks 
 his A_Level subjects are interesting  
 because he chose to do them.There are 
 lots to choose from also sports       
 and clubs to join.He does chess and   
 hockey.The only bad thing about the   
 school is its state of repair         
 particularly the upper school         
 buildings which were only supposed to 
 last for twenty years and have so far 
 been there for twenty three years.    
{William Parker School is the old      
{Grammar}School.When it turned         
 Comprehensive some parents still      
 fought to send their sons there even  
 though they lived out of the area.    
 However the situation is now resolving
 itself to most people's satisfaction. </content>
