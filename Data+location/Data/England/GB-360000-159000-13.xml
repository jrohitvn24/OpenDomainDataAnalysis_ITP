		<title>13CHURCH FARM CLUTTON</title>
		<content>     We interviewed Colin Withers about
 every day life on Church Farm. He told
 us that the farm was mentioned in the 
{Domesday Book}. He told us that his   
 family had owned the farm for 30      
 years. They have 400 acres, 40 of     
 which are rented.                     
           All of his family had       
 worked on the farm. It was a family   
 tradition. His father writes the      
 cheques, his brother feeds the pigs   
 and Colin and another man mostly look 
 after the cows.He gets up at aout 5.45
 and stops work at about 6p.m.,but     
 later in the summer. His job is       
 looking after the cows and milking    
 them.He has 240 ewes and lambs. Colin 
 thinks that to be a good farmer you   
 have to be prepared to do things for  
 them. He does not like it when animals
 die but it does not happen very often.
