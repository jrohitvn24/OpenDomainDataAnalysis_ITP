		<content>{Kerry Marriott writes:}In Rookley and 
 the countryside around there is a wide
 range of things to enjoy. Outdoor pur-
 suits include cycling, horse-riding,  
 shooting, fishing, jogging, golf, foot
 ball, cricket and camping. At home    
 people are busy with sewing, reading, 
 D.I.Y.jobs or hobbies like collecting 
 stamps and painting. More and more    
 people have computers and videos. As a
 family we go walking, visiting, swim- 
 ming and out to eat or to the cinema. 
                                       
{Kevin Morris wrote about Sundays:}I am
 nine and my family consists of Mum and
 Dad, Gran'ma, a brother and 2 sisters,
 one is married. On{Sundays}we relax   
 and do what we enjoy. We have tea in  
 bed. Breakfast is about 9a.m.- cereal,
 bacon &amp; eggs. In winter Paul plays    
 football. Sometimes he goes for a run 
 whilst I bicycle beside him. (cont)   </content>
