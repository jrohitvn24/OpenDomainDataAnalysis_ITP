		<content>{B.M.X. Bikes                          
 My hobby is riding my bike. I ride it 
 every day. It is a Grifter but it has 
 lots of B.M.X. gear on it. B.M.X      
 stands for{Bicycle Motor X}, which is 
 a very big sport in England and the   
 U.S.A. The best B.M.Xers are{Huch}and 
{Haro.}These bikes are ridden by the   
 top riders in the world. Huch bikes   
 have about one thousand pounds worth  
 of gear on them.                      
                                       
                                       
{Hacky Sack                            
 Hacky Sack is a revolutionary new     
 sport which can be easily carried in a
 pocket.It is smaller than a tennis    
 ball and it is full of tiny beads.The 
 idea of it is that you try and keep it
 up off the ground with a variety of   
 kicks but it is difficult because it  
 does not bounce.                      </content>
