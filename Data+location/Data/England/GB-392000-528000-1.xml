		<title>01Hudeshope Head</title>
		<content>  Part of Middleton Common on the north
 side of Teesdale. Dissected by        
 Hudeshop Head, a tributary valley with
 its southward flowing beck.  Moorland 
 rises from 300m to 600m and is        
 generally open pasture marked with    
 striahght dry stone walls built for   
 intake (1816) enclosures.  A minor    
 road circuits the head to and from    
 Middleton linking three active hill   
 forms engaged in stock rearing.  The  
 slopes are littered with lead mining  
 relics - derelict mine buildings,     
 waste heaps, and deep trenches        
 (hushes). The largest hush - Coldberry
 Gutter - cuts through the watershed of
 Hardberry Hill.  Nearby is Coldberry  
 Moss, still holding water, one of many
 water tanks formerly used for hushing 
 and ore dressing.
