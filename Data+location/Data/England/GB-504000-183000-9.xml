 servicemen and women,1,800 of them in 
 the U.K,500 overseas such as Russia,  
 U.S.A,New Zealand,Brazil,Kenya,Tokyo, 
 India,Katmandu and the Arabian Gulf.  
 There are 520 personnel in the        
 Borough of Hillingdon and 450 children
 at Borough schools.Scouts and guides  
 use the parade square for St Georges  
 Day parades and air cadets have summer
 camps at the base.On the base they    
 also have a Mark 1H Spitfire which was
 built one year after World War Two    
 finished and so missed the Battle of  
 Britain,but it has been used by the   
 RAF and they are very proud of it.RAF 
 Uxbridge is the headquarters of the   
 Central Band of the Royal Air Force   
 and the School of Music and they      
 frequently entertain the community.
