		<title>16THE ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND</title>
		<content> The Adventure Playground has been on  
 the present site since 1980.It has a  
 building and land over two acres      
 which is plenty of playing space,in   
 which lots of activities take place.  
 Children can do art and craft,cooking,
 gardening,painting and den building.  
 The site is supervised at all times by
 the play leaders so that nothing can  
 go wrong.It is not a club and there is
 no membership.They make no charges    
 except for swimming and cooking.It is 
 in the middle of Park Springs Estate  
 so most of the children come from Park
 Springs but some come from town and   
 villages nearby.The holidays are the  
 busiest times,but the playground is   
 open all year round.During the        
 holidays hot meals for the children   
 are provided at very low costs.Money  
 is raised by outings.
