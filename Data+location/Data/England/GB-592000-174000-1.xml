		<content>   The block under review consists of  
 seven one kilometre squares of{sea}and
 of the remainder only one is totally  
 land. The small proportion of{low     
{lying land}divides into two main      
 categories, residential and rough     
 grazing.                              
   The residential area is part of     
 the town centre of Sheerness on the   
 Isle of Sheppey which is linked to the
 mainland of Kent by the Kingsferry    
 Bridge. Sheerness is situated to the  
 north west of the island on the       
 estuary of the River Thames.          
   The grazing land is now used for    
 recreational purposes.                
   From east to west there is a change 
 from land covered by older{housing,}to
 land in part used for{caravans and    
{chalets}and leisure pursuits, to      
 higher ground occupied by more recent 
 developments.                         </content>
