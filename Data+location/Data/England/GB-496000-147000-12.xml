		<content>   Many old buildings still exist for  
 example St. Mary's Church (Quarry St.)
 constructed in the 11th to 13th       
 centuries, Holy Trinity Church        
 (rebuilt in the mid 18th century),    
 Abbots Hospital and the Guildhall.    
   In 1651 the R. Wey was canalised to 
 become The Wey Navigation and was used
 for transporting many types of        
 products. It is now owned by The      
 National Trust.                       
   The railway in Guildford dates from 
 1845 when the main line from London   
 was extended from Woking, and the main
 line station was opened. By 1870      
 commuting to London was a well        
 established practice. Between 1740 and
 1840 the population doubled and in the
 late 19th century it grew threefold:  
 most of the increase has been         
 attributed to immigration. The pattern
 of growth continues today. {J. Speake </content>
