		<title>16Hiams Farms, Prickwillow</title>
		<content>{Mr Green}has worked for Hiams for{36  
{years.}He thinks its the next best    
 thing to having your own farm.        
{ 'I manage 5 Farms}now but the biggest
 is Putney Hill Farm where{Hiam Club } 
 stands. It is 800 acres which together
 with the other farms totals{2,800     
{acres.}It is the best we have to farm 
 as it has Peat with a depth of 9      
 inches, it used to be 18 inches.      
  We protect Crops from the wind but   
 there hasn't been a bad blow for 8/10 
 years. A{Fen Blow}is like a big black 
 dust storm. We do add{Manganese}but as
 the minerals from underneath mix we   
 use less and less.                    
  We store all our Potatoes at Shippey 
 Hill.It is called Shippey Hill because
 there was a time when Fen Potatoes    
 weren't liked as much as the Highlands
 grown variety. So Frederick Hiams     
 changed the names to help sell more.  </content>
