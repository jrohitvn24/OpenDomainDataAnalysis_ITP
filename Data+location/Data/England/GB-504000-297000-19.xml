		<title>19OLD SULEHAY FOREST</title>
		<content>  Old Sulehay Forest is the north part 
 ofthe ancient Rockingham Forest.      
 It is a very dense forest  with a lot 
 of trees.  The main trees are         
 Oak, Hazel, and Hawthorn.  The wood is
 about I square kilometre. The most    
 common tree in the forest is hazel.   
 In 100 square metres 61 trees are     
 hazel out of 115 ; that is more than  
 half. A PH reading of 6.5 average     
 indicates Hazel trees prefer slightly 
 acidic soil as well as moist soil.    
 The forest floor is muddy with ground 
 being very moist. The moisture helps  
 the trees to grow. The wood has a big 
 path going through it for people. The 
 wood has lots of different plants and 
 animals. Not a lot of light gets      
 through the leaves of the trees so the
 forest is dark and gloomy.
