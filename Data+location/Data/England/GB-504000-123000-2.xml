		<title>02THE ALTAR, WISBOROUGH GREEN</title>
		<content> This church was built in the eleventh 
 century but was added to in 1867. In  
 the church there is an altar.  The top
 stone is of the same stone as Stone   
 henge and is probably 4,000 years old.
 When Edward VI was king he ordered all
 stone altars and stone statues to be  
 smashed, but some men came from Lox   
 wood and told Wisborough Green that   
 the soldiers were coming.  The locals 
 took down the stone and hid the bottom
 part under a bridge in Holy Water Lane
 and they built the other part into    
 Loxwood Vicarage chimney.             
 In the nineteenth century when the    
 bridge was being repaired the stone   
 was found and when they pulled down   
 Loxwood Vicarage they found the top   
 stone.  It was used as a garden seat  
 until 1937 when both stones were ret- 
 urned to St. Peter's Church.
