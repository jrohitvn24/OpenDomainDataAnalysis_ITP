		<title>07Farming Around Appleby</title>
		<content>    Farming is the biggest industry in 
 and around Appleby.Most of the land is
 used for growing grass for silage and 
 hay.I live on a farm called Low Barn  
 its two miles out of Appleby.About    
 half of the four hundred and fifteen  
 acres we own is used to grow grass for
 silage and hay.                       
    We own about four hundred sheep and
 two hundred cows.Our cows are         
 freisians we use most of them to milk 
 and sell the milk to the Express Dairy
 at Appleby.The other cows are fattened
 up to sell for beef.We keep the ewe   
 sheep for lambs and sell the hogs.When
 the ewes get old we keep all the hogs 
 and sell the old ewes.                
    The busiest time of the year is in 
 the summer when we cut the grass for  
 silage and hay.
