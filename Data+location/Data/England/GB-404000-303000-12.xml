		<title>12BROWNHILLS CARNIVAL.</title>
		<content>   On Saturday 22nd June 1985, my      
 school, St Bernadette's, entered a    
 float in Brownhills Carnival. It's    
 theme was 'Alice in Wonderland'. The  
 weather was reasonable, although it   
 rained slightly at times.             
   Our characters included Alice, the  
 March Hare, the Dormouse, the Mad     
 Hatter, the Duchess, her Footmen and  
 the royal party, the Caterpillar, the 
 Gryphon, the Mock Turtle, the Cheshire
 Cat, a rose and the playing cards, as 
 well as Lewis Carroll.                
   We sang for the Mayor and Mayoress, 
 the Carnival Queen and her attendants.
 We then paraded through the streets   
 and collected donations for the       
 Brownhills Round Table charities in   
 the cups and bowls from the Mad       
 Hatters tea party table. We won first 
 prize for which we were given a red   
 rosette and Â£50 for school fund.      </content>
