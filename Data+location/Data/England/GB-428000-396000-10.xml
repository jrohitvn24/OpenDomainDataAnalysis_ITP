		<content>{DEEPCAR}There are  3 phases of        
 development:nodal around Vaughton Hill
 (1855 O.S.), linear along Manchester  
 Rd.(1929 O.S.) and residential estates
 on the hillside S. of Carr Rd. from   
 1960s. In 1851 there were 7 houses. In
 the next 50 yrs. were built St. John's
 church(1878), schools (Jun.1856, Inf. 
 1896) and police station (1890) to    
 accompany industrial devt.{Victorian  
 houses and earlier mostly built from  
{local stone}(Inf.Sch. and police stn. 
 brick) as are the nearby farms. The   
{estates}were built on former farmland 
 changing the village into a dormitory 
{suburb}for commuters; most detached,  
 semis or low-level flats.'Green Belt' 
 restricts further building for at     
 least 10 yrs. Devt. on S. side of the 
 valley to avoid smoke from industry.  
   Many farms and smallholdings near   
{WORTLEY}are 17th. Century.            </content>
