		<content>   Between 1860 and 1880 the population
 of Burham and Halling almost doubled  
 and that of Snodland and Wouldham     
 trebled because of the rapid growth of
 the cement industry.                  
   Barges on the River Medway were used
 to transport the cement.However,the   
 cement factories on the River Thames  
 could be reached by much larger ships.
 Factories began to close along the    
 Medway during the 1920's especially   
 those on the eastern side.Rugby Cement
 in Halling and,until recently,Blue    
 Circle in Holborough developed the use
 of road transport.                    
                                       
   Other smaller industries in the area
 include a building firm,a small       
 electronics firm,iron and metal works,
 printing workshops and a woodyard.
