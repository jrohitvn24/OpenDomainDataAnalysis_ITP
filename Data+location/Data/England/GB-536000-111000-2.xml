		<content>  There was difficulty going to        
 Ashcombe Bottom because the public    
 path that runs up through the         
 wooded valley was covered with crops  
 and over-growth.Obviously yhe footpath
 is not used by walkers very often.    
  There were a lot of rabbits and moles
 in the woods.No moles were seen, but  
 there were a lot of mole hills on the 
 ground.We did see a number of rabbits.
  Many magpies were seen in the trees.A
 large number of cinnabar moths and    
 tortoise-shell butterflies were also  
 observed.Most of the cinnabar moths   
 were on the red campion when we saw   
 them.                                 
  These are some of the wild flowers we
 noted:Fern,Honeysuckle,Gorse,Black-   
 berry,Hawthorn,Buttercups,Clover,     
 Dogrose,Red campion,Golden rod and a  
 lot of thistles.
