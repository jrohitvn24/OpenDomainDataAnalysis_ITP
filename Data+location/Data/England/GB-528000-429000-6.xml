		<content> All Saints Church Roos was  once under
 the patronage of the Prior of Kirkham 
 Abbey and Archbishop,Walter Gray in   
 1223.The building then was of wood and
 rectangular in shape.By               
 the reign of                          
 Elizabeth 1 the church and land was   
 under the control of Lord Burghley.In 
 1776 the land and rights were handed  
 to the Sykes family.They then began to
 alter the church to its present form: 
 nave,chancel,two aisles and a tower at
 the west end.The tower has a belfry   
 with a peel of 5 bells.The church is  
 built of sandstone round the windows, 
 doors and corners with flint fill-in  
 on the walls.The entry to the church  
 is from a wooden gateway,along an     
 avenue of boxed yew trees and a flight
 of stone steps.The church yard is well
 kept and used as the village          
 graveyard.                            </content>
