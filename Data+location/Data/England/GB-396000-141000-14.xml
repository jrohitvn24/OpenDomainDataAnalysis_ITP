		<title>14AREA, BUILDINGS, CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> The area is on the southern edge of   
 Salisbury Plain. The landscape is     
 rolling chalk downland used mainly for
 agriculture, dotted with clumps of    
 trees, many of which at one time      
 sheltered dwelling places. The village
 of Chitterne lies in a valley         
 surrounded by mature trees.           
 All that remains of the 14th century  
 St Mary's Church is the Chancel built 
 of stone with a tiled roof. There are 
 two ancient barns built of wood on    
 brick bases, and other farm buildings 
 belonging to the brick Elizabethan    
 Manor . The King's Head Public House  
 is an old stone building, at one time 
 thatched.                             
 Chitterne lies within a conservation  
 area, and there are a number of listed
 buildings, and a hump backed bridge,  
 no longer used by traffic.
