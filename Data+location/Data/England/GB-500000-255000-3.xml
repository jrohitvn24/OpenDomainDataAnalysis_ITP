		<content> I did my piano examination on a Friday
 in Bedford. My tummy went all strange 
 when my name was called. When I went  
 in I felt even worse. A big fat cat   
 was sitting on the carpet. I heard a  
 bell. I went into a room where a very 
 smiley lady told me to shut the door  
 or else the cat would come in and jump
 on my back while I was playing. The   
 piano was a grand piano and was much  
 bigger than the piano we have at home.
 I played scales, broken chords and my 
 pieces. I did some sight_reading and  
 an aural test. When I came out the    
 first thing I wanted was to get some  
 fresh air. My mum said to me, "Do you 
 think you did well?" I answered, "I   
 don't know."
