		<title>05A Dying Industry??</title>
		<content>   This unique life style and the old  
 traditional methods of fishing has    
 been passed down from father to son.  
                                       
   Due to falling catches, the hard    
 life and the effort needed to make a  
 living,interest is steadily declining.
 Even when the catch is back home there
 is a lot of work to do.Fish have to be
 cleaned and filleted, cockles washed  
 and boiled, shrimps cooked and picked.
 Picking, to remove the shell, actually
 provides a number of housewives with a
 way to supplement their incomes.      
                                       
   It does seem a pity that this unique
 industry is in danger of dying out but
 maybe, Teena may carry on her families
 traditional form of employment.
