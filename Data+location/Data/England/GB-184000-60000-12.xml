		<title>12LADY NANCE HAMLET</title>
		<content> The buildings at Lady Nance,near      
 Mountjoy are mainly made of elvan     
 stone with slate rooves.These are     
 locally quarried materials and are far
 more common than bricks in Cornwall,  
 although nowadays concrete blocks are 
 used on many new buildings in the     
 Newquay area as they are relatively   
 cheap and sand is easily available    
 from the St.Austell china clay        
 district.It is a waste product from   
 the lucrative china clay business run 
 by English China Clays.               
 One permanent resident of the area    
 said that he found it a peaceful place
 to live apart from the noise of       
 aircraft flying to and from St.Mawgan 
 airbase.It is a pleasant rural area of
 open fields with much wild animal and 
 plant life.
