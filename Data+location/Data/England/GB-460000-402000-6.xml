		<content>{AFTER THE GREAT WAR:}With the opening 
 of the pit, many people came to the   
 village. One of the local farmers     
 bought a motorbus and this meandered  
 round picking up people and taking    
 them to work and at night the bus was 
 used to house chickens.               
{IN 1939 WORLD WAR II BEGAN:}At the    
 Church of England school were air_raid
 shelters.They have been gone for      
 25 years.The Germans tried to bomb the
 pit,and failed. A gunner came down on 
 Paxton Crescent and gunned doors. At  
 this time there were no estates but   
 many farms.Down Butterill Drive was   
 Credland's farm and at Cow House Lane 
 was a place where you could hire      
 horses.Where Tranmoor School is were  
 arable fields.At the back of Beavers' 
 paper shop was a cobbler's and an     
 undertaker called Crabtree.There      
 were also many orchards in Armthorpe. </content>
