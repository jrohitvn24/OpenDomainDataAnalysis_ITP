		<content> We checked and we are sure that there 
 are approximately one thousand people 
 living within the area covered by our 
 block. We interviewed sixty-five men  
 and from the results we prepared a    
 graph to show the different categories
 of employment. It soon became apparent
 that more people worked in industry   
 than in any other sector of           
 employment:-                          
   20 worked in industry               
   10 worked in commerce               
    4 worked in education as teachers  
    7 worked in agriculture            
   12 worked in miscellaneous jobs e.g.
      shopkeepers;publicans;solicitors 
    4 worked in medicine e.g. doctors  
    6 were retired                     
    2 were unemployed                  
 Those working in agriculture live and 
 work within the area whilst almost all
 the rest commute outside the area.    </content>
