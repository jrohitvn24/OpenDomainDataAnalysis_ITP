		<title>18SCHOOL SPORTS DAY.</title>
		<content> Every year in July the school has its 
 Sports Day to which parents are       
 invited. Heats are run off before the 
 day itself so that it is the finals   
 that are held on sports day.          
 There are several different kinds of  
 events; running races, egg &amp; spoon,   
 potato race, sack race, relay race,   
 and a three legged race. There is also
 a cricket ball throwing competition.  
 The children are divided into four    
 groups 'Blue' 'Green' 'Red' and       
 'Yellow' and points are awarded for   
 the first three places in the races.  
 The winning team is the one who has   
 the most points after the races have  
 been run. A cup is presented to the   
 captain of the winning team and a     
 ribbon of the team colour is threaded 
 through it. The winning team usually  
 run a lap of honour.
