		<title>04Scenic Beauty-Tamar Valley</title>
		<content>       Today the  Tamar  Valley is very
 peaceful and quiet. When you walk down
 beside the river  the  bank is teeming
 with wild life.  One side of the Tamar
 Valley is  steeply  wooded and makes a
 lovely scene, especially  with the big
 rock  in  the  middle  which  we  call
 Chimney  Rock.  As you  walk down  the
 river you can listen to all the sounds
 around,like the song of the birds, the
 wind  in  the  trees  and  perhaps the
 jumping  of a  fish.  Down  beside the
 river you might  see salmon fishermen.
       About a hundred years ago it was
 very  different  because it was a very
 busy mining area.  It was noisy, smoky
 and many more people were around.There
 were a  lot  of  sailing barges on the
 river transporting coal, horse manure,
 limestone and  mineral ores.  Nowadays
 you can  see  the ruins   of limekilns
 and brickworks covered in brambles.   </content>
