		<title>16Mayfield Yarns: The Cottages</title>
		<content>Behind the Mill in Church Mayfield     
stand the original cottages.  There are
approx. 60 cottages in 5 terraces.     
Most of the cottages are now privately 
owned.                                 
  Access is difficult.  The cottages   
are on an "island" surrounded          
by the River Dove and the Henmore      
brook.  There is no "through" traffic  
and the atmosphere is strangely quiet  
and anachronistic, the only noise being
the constant sound of running water    
through the mill.  It is a small       
industrial enclave surrounded by       
fields.                                
  The cottages seem untouched by time  
with very few obvious modernisations.  
The only 1980's touch being the        
preponderance of television aerials and
parked cars.  The area is still        
artisan, but one can imagine a change  
in future years.                       </content>
