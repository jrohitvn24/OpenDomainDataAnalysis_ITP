		<title>12King's School - Cadet Force.</title>
		<content> On Friday, 7 June 1985, the Combined  
 Cadet Force celebrated its 75th       
 Anniversary. In 1910, the Contingent  
 had just 2 officers and 36 cadets, but
 in 1985, there are 11 officers and 238
 cadets. To celebrate the Anniversary, 
 the Contingent was inspected by Field 
 Marshal Sir Edwin Bramall, GCB, OBE,  
 MC, Chief of the Defence Staff.  He   
 also presented the Contingent with its
 own Standard, which depicts the School
 crest on a field of dark blue, with   
 the CCF badge in the hoist corner.    
 Once the formal side of the day was   
 over, all the Guests and Parents were 
 invited to inspect static displays,   
 which showed the many aspects of CCF  
 training - map reading, drill,        
 shooting, campcraft, fieldcraft,      
 signals, vehicle maintenance and RAF  
 skills.
