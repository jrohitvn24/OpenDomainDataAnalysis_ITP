		<title>07Warping Drain</title>
		<content> It was constructed in the C17 by the  
 dutchman Vermuyden who came over to   
 show the English how to drain and make
 use of flooding tide to deposit warp  
 (soil sediment)on the land.The drain  
 is 2.4km long.At the end of the drain 
 is a pumping station built in 1943 and
 opened in 1944.At the River Trent end 
 on the bank sides there used to be two
 two large wooden gates which have now 
 been removed.On the drain side one of 
 the openings to the river has been    
 bricked up.Before they used to open   
 the gates at high tide and allow the  
 river to enter the drain and flow out 
 over the land.It would flood up to    
 Amcotts in the north and as far as    
 Ealand and Crowle to the west.When the
 tide subsided the water was allowed to
 drain back into the river and the     
 sediment which had been carried by the
 rushing river remained on the land.   </content>
