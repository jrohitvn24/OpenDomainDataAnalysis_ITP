I already made stoneware pottery,and   
I decided to try making more           
decorative items in porcelain. I had   
pressed flowers for many years and I   
now made these into jewellery,         
paperweights and pictures.             
      For nine months I built up a     
stock of pottery, cushions, patchwork, 
pressed flower goods ,rag dolls and    
hobby horses,all of which I made       
myself.I revived my interest in screen 
printing and learned how to assemble   
jewellery from beads and components.I  
bought potpourris and lavender in bulk 
and made more sachets,lavender dolls   
and herb pillows;and I dulled my       
enjoyment of macrame by producing      
several plant hangings and book        
marks.My husband was persuaded to turn 
some wooden bowls and lace bobbins.
