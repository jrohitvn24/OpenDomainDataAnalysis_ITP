		<content> Mr.C.Jakes has made a{special study}of
 Prickwillow and the area. His family  
 has been at Prickwillow for several   
 generations. Mr Jakes house is built  
 where the Old River bed used to be,   
 the access road is called{Old Bank}and
 it winds along the old South River    
 bank.                                 
 'This area was not drained completely 
 until the beginning of the last       
 Century. In the winter the River would
 flood its banks and make the land more
 fertile for farmers. The Cambridge to 
 Norwich Line was built in 1845 on an  
 embankment but this slipped because of
 the Peat. The{Padnal Signal Box}which 
 can be seen by the Ely, Prickwillow   
 road is leaning to one side as the    
 land drops. The former School, Church,
 Pumping Engine Sheds and Vicarage are 
 built on Piles. The Vicarage has 10   
 extra steps since it was built.       </content>
