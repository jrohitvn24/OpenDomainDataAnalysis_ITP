		<content>  This low-lying open pasture land with
 deep alluvial soil and good rainfall  
 supports many excellent dairy farms.  
 Friesian cattle were introduced sixty 
 years ago.Many herds have one or two  
 Guernseys to improve the quality of   
 the milk.Artificial insemination is   
 popular and the bull calves are reared
 for beef.                             
  Cheese,once made by the farmer's wife
 is now produced in the noted factory  
 in Sturminster Newton,the milk being  
 transported in bulk by tanker. Only   
 one farm keeps a few poultry.         
  Formerly each family would farm its  
 own land employing labourers who lived
 in farm cottages.Now a big farm can be
 part of a combine and being fully     
 mechanised needs only 3 workers.The   
 farmhouses are let to incomers and the
 cottages sold to retired folk or week-
 enders.All are well modernised.       </content>
