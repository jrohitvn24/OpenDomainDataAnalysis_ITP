		<content> One of the many features of the       
 Carnival is the choosing of the       
 Carnival Princess. She is selected at 
 the Vicarage Fete in June or July.    
 Anyone between the age of four and    
 eleven is eligible to enter and the   
 panel of judges changes every year.   
 The Carnival Princess has two escorts 
 and a reserve. The only duties are to 
 be there on the day! In 1985 thirty   
 six children entered and the judges   
 were looking for things like          
 prettiness, dress design and a winning
 smile.The Carnival Princess is the    
 best thing about the Fete but there   
 are many other items. For example     
 every year a class from the small     
 village school of Titchfield go to the
 Fete to do some dancing. There are    
 also many games but personally I think
 the crowning of the Carnival Princess 
 is the best aspect.                   </content>
