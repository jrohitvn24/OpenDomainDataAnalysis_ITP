		<title>14NACTON C.OF E. CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Martin's Church was built in the  
11th century out of stone and wood. Its
site was probably chosen because of its
defensive position. As the population  
grew, the Nave and then the tower      
with the bells were added. Later on    
a Chapel was built and dedicated to    
the Broke family. There is also a      
monument to Admiral Vernon, who was    
nick-named Grog. Another aisle was     
built eight years ago.  There is now a 
leak in the roof over the North Aisle  
and the Church has appealled for money 
repair it. The services for Orwell Park
School are held there. The Church      
shares its Rector with parishes of     
Levington and Bucklesham.
