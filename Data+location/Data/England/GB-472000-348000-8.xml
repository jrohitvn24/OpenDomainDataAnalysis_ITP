		<title>08THE FOSSE WAY</title>
		<content> The{Fosse Way}- the old Roman road    
 which originally ran from {Lincoln}   
 through{Leicester}to{Cirencester}- is,
 as far as{Bingham,}the main route from
{Newark }to {Nottingham.}Beyond{       
{Bingham}much of the{Fosse Way}has been
 a dual carriageway for at least 10    
 years, but the stretch from{Newark}to{
{Bingham}remains unwidened.  It carries
 a heavy load of traffic, and there    
 have been numerous accidents along its
 length, particularly at{East Stoke}and
 other crossroads.  Recently some      
 passing places have been built at the 
 crossings so that traffic can pass    
 turning vehicles, which has helped the
 flow of traffic a little. {East Stoke,
 divided in two by this busy road, is  
 one of the very few villages which are
 actually situated on the{Fosse.}
