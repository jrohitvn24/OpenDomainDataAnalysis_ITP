		<title>19The Wildlife of Hartwell.</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
There is a forest in Hartwell but it   
has decreased over the years.Still the 
wildlife flocks there and does well    
even though farming has ruined hedges  
by joining together small fields to    
make ploughing easier.Recently the     
motorway was repaired and soil and some
concrete rubble was dumped all over    
part of the forest.We think this has   
killed quite alot of plants,trees and  
animals.The forest has red,fallow,roe &amp;
muntjac deer,rabbits,grey squirrel,fox,
badger,owls and lots of woodland birds 
&amp; butterflies.In the village there are 
house sparrows,house martins,starlings,
swallows and swifts.There other common 
birds too but one is the collared dove 
which mews like a cat for its call.
