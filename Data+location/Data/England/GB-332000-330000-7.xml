		<content>{Oswestry Borough Council},who handle  
 the refuse from Whittington,have their
 headquarters at{York Fields}in        
 Oswestry.They have sixteen vehicles   
 the biggest of which holds forty      
 gallons of fuel.There are four big    
 vehicles which collect rubbish from   
 the public,two street vehicles with   
 special brushes which have to be      
 replaced each week and two normal     
 street vehicles.There are also skip   
 vehicles.Plastic bags are supplied    
 for the rubbish and these are         
 collected each week.When the bags of  
 rubbish are thrown into the vehicles, 
 the inside spins round so that the    
 rubbish gets cut up and then          
 compressed.This is called rotor       
 pressing.Each big vehicle costs       
 Â£37.000.
