     In Butterton, there are lots of   
activities that children and their     
parents can do in their spare time.    
                                       
     The children of Butterton do not  
get together very often, but tend to   
play games at home with their family.  
                                       
     The Black Lion pub is a centre for
various activities.  There, you can    
play darts or pool, or play on the     
pinball machine or video games.        
                                       
     The Black Lion has tables outside 
at which you can sit during warm       
weather. There is also a children's    
room.
