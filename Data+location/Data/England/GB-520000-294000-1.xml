		<title>01Description of Area</title>
		<content>  The area has two centres of housing. 
 The northern part comprises private   
 and council estates in Stanground     
 served by adequate shops and schools. 
 The{A605}runs through the estates and 
 is both a physical and social barrier.
 This is the main route between{       
{Peterborough}and east coast towns.    
 To the south-west is the village of{  
{Farcet}(pop. 400).                    
  Both areas look to{Peterborough}for  
 employment, recreation and most other 
 amenities. The recent opening of{     
{Fletton Parkway}running to the west of
 the area has placed most parts of the 
 city within easy reach. The population
 is a stable one, mixed working/middle 
 class, without obvious social         
 problems.                             
  The remainder of the area is fenland 
 where arable farming predominates.
