		<title>05St.Oswald's Church.</title>
		<content> Described as the oldest church in the 
 North-East corner of the old East     
 Riding of Yorkshire,St.Oswalds took 50
 years to build.Its massive square     
 tower topped by a gold plated fish    
 weather vane,stands on the cliff top. 
 The church is surrounded by a         
 graveyard with many old tombstones    
 bearing interesting inscriptions.At   
 one time the West end of the church   
 was cobbled and sheep from a nearby   
 farm were allowed to eat the grass    
 that grew between the stones.In 1908 a
 fire destroyed the organ and pent of  
 the roof.Next to the modern,          
 carved altar is the old stone one     
 which is believed to contain some     
 relics it was found in the floor near 
 the chancel door in 1925.             
   The stone effigy in the South hall  
 is probably the memorial of a boy     
 bishop who died in office.            </content>
