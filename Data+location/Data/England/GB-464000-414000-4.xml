		<content> DINNER WE GO OUT TO PLAY FOOTBALL AND 
 WE COME BACK IN AT A  QUARTER PAST    
 ONE. WE THEN GET ON WITH ART AND CRAFT
 OR SCIENCE UNTIL A QUARTER TO THREE   
 WHEN WE AGAIN GO OUT TO  PLAY UNTIL   
 THREE O CLOCK. WE COME IN TO SCHOOL   
 AND HAVE A QUIZ OR A STORY FOR HALF AN
 HOUR . THEN IT IS HOME TIME .I GO HOME
 AND CALL FOR MARTIN DAVID ANDERTON    
 AND I PLAY UNTIL HALF PAST FOUR WHEN  
 I GO HOME AND HAVE MY TEA. I OFTEN    
 CALL FOR MARTIN AFTERWARDS AND WE     
 PLAY GAMES AND WE SOMETIMES TORMENT MY
 SISTER BY CALLING HER NAMES . THEN AT 
 HALF PAST SEVEN I RETURN HOME AND GET 
 READY FOR BED. I TURN ON THE T.V.     
 AND HAVE MY SUPPER. CRISPS AND MILK   
 ARE MY FAVOURITE. THEN AT HALF PAST   
 NINE I GO TO BED.                     
                 GOOD NIGHT.
