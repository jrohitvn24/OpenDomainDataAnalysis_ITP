		<content> The Chase is used by local schools and
Walton Chasers for this sport which has
become popular in the last 10 years.   
 Competitors have to find their way    
around a course that is marked on their
map.At different points they have to   
find a flag.Each flag has a different  
number or letter.The competitors have a
sheet that tells them the code of the  
flag they are looking for.There is a   
punch near each flag with metal spikes 
in a pattern for that flag alone.On    
finding a flag the competitor punches  
his card and when all the spaces are   
punched he/she returns to base.A route 
marked with ribbon is for children.

Red biro-to copy master map.           
A whistle-for safety if you get lost.  
A compass-to find way around.
