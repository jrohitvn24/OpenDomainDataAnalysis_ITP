		<content> There are three recreational          
 facilities which attract people here. 
 The Barley Mow pub, situated by the   
 busy A22, was built over 200 years    
 ago. It is owned by Phoenix Brewery.  
 It has a large, newly built car park  
 and garden. The landlord likes living 
 in this historic, attractive and      
 friendly area. He enlarged the car    
 park because he has increased his     
 trade by serving a variety of pub food
 which is proving very popular.        
 Next door is a caravan site which is  
 managed by the pub landlord. The      
 caravans are private holiday homes    
 used from Easter till October. Behind 
 this is the Rugby and Football ground.
 The club is active throughout the     
 season. The wooden club house has     
 changing and bathing facilities as    
 well as a bar.                        
                                       </content>
