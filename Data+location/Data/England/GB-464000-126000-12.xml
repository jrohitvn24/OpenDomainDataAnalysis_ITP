		<content> Although the land is intensively      
 farmed, the hedgerows abound with     
 animal life. Oak, ash, beech, field   
 maple, crab-apple and holly grow at   
 intervals in the hedges and in their  
 roots squeaks and rustlings betray the
 homes of invisible creatures. Walks   
 are full of surprises. You may find   
 the nest of a fieldmouse,who will eye 
 you suspiciously for a moment before  
 slipping away. An inquisitive stoat   
 will play "peek-a-boo" behind a       
 treetrunk or a squirrel, missing his  
 footing, may drop suddenly at your    
 feet in a flurry of leaves, pick      
 himself up and scamper away. Pheasants
 hide silently as you pass, then rise  
 up squawking loudly behind you. On the
 lower ground an adder might cross your
 path. Wild roe deer inhabit the woods 
 and bound away as you pass, leaping   
 the fences effortlessly.              </content>
