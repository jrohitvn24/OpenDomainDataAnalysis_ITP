		<title>12HISTORY OF THE PARISH</title>
		<content>  The turbulent years of the           
 Reformation 1540 - 1642 did not       
 by-pass Buckhorn Weston or the        
 surrounding area. In 1549 the ancient 
 catholic faith was still practised in 
 the parish church and all its services
 were conducted in Latin. A small      
 Protestant party formed itself in the 
 village and strongly objected to these
 ceremonies. Everyone was compelled by 
 law to attend church at this time but 
 this group refused to and built a     
 meeting house of their own in         
 opposition to the church. This was    
 suppressed and did not come into being
 again until they took possession of   
 the church in Cromwellian days.The    
 dispossessed catholics held services  
 inthe open air and the site called    
 "Vespers Hollow"still recalls the     
 event.
