		<content>{The Gate Public House}and{Gnarley     
{Cottage}were built about 200 years    
 ago, the latter probably providing    
 stabling for the Inn. The Gate        
 probably takes its name from the old  
 Toll Gate at the top of the hill.     
 Gnarley Cottage was used (1912) as a  
 wheelwrights, carpenters and coopers. 
 The local road was previously known   
 as Brick Kiln Close, which suggest    
 there was probably a kiln there at    
 some time in the past. The{Gnarleys   
 refer to the spinney behind the       
 allotments. In the 19th century the   
 land belonged to the Poyser family and
 later Elizabeth Freeman until 1934.   
 One inhabitant still remembers the    
 cottages at the beginning of the      
 century having water pumps, wells, two
 earth closets between six houses, a   
 coal house and a pigsty each. Waste   
 water ran away in an open channel.    </content>
