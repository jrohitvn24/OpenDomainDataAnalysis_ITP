 My name is Lisa Myson. I live at 25,  
 Wembley Ave.Maylandsea.My mum and dad 
 have lived here ever since they were  
 married,17 years ago. I have two      
 sisters called Paula and Mechelle.I   
 live in a semi-detached house made    
 out of bricks.My house has three      
 bedrooms,two bathrooms and one dining 
 room,one sitting room and a kitchen.In
 the living room we have the           
 telephone and a video.When my dad     
 moved here he had the dining room and 
 a bathroom built on.My garden is quite
 small and it has five trees in it.We  
 have two plum trees,one cherry tree   
 one apple tree and one pear tree.We   
 have not got many flowers but I have  
 an evergreen bush and I also live near
 the sea.
