		<title>17Leisure Time in Newmillerdam</title>
		<content>   Unless you enjoy the countryside and
 walking there is little opportunity to
 pursue any leisure time activity in   
 the area.                             
   For the young people there is a     
 thriving youth club at Kettlethorpe   
 School but the community centre in    
 Kettlethorpe Hall next to the school  
 is now closed.                        
   You can go fishing in the lake at   
 the Country Park or for walks or bird 
 watching.                             
   The Wakefield (Woodthorpe Golf Club)
 is in the area to the north of the    
 Park. An l8 hole course with a par of 
 72.It offers a challenge to local     
 golfers.                              
   There is a cricket team based at the
 Pledwick Well Inn and one at Chevet.  
 There is also a selection of public   
 houses which from the outside try to  
 maintain a traditional character.     </content>
