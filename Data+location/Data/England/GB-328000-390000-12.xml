		<title>12View of Poulton by Lynsey</title>
		<content> Poulton is quite a large area,        
 consisting of thousands of houses,    
 many shops and some schools.Every     
 morning, we can see how busy the roads
 are with people commutig to work and  
 children going to school.We can see   
 shopkeepers preparing to open the     
 stores for business.                  
 Poulton also has access to the docks, 
 where we can see the ships unloading  
 their cargoes.Poulton is covered by{  
{Police,Fire and Ambulance}services,   
 which do a fine job. We have a{Library
  which is used by adults and children.
 I have lived in{Poulton}for 7 years   
 and like it very much. Everybody is so
 friendly and helpful.The people of    
 Poulton also keep beautiful gardens   
 which look lovely in full bloom with  
 sweet smeeling flowers and the park   
 with freshly cut grass, and the trees 
 in full leaf in summer.               </content>
