		<title>20The Church-North Door</title>
		<content>{St. Nicholas' Church}in Boarhunt is   
 made of flint and stone with a tiled  
 roof. The North Door known as the     
{Devil's Door}was never used by common 
 people, only witches and evil spirits 
 used it. It was said that if a        
 possesed child was christened the     
 exorised spirit fled through the North
 Door.                                 
 After the civil war between the       
 Royalists and the Roundheads,many     
 doors were bricked up to stamp out    
 superstition about witches. An        
 ordinary person could walk through    
 that door and istantly gain the repute
 of being a witch or worlock. These    
 people were either mobbed or if a     
 minister was near,put to the test     
 either way they died. Then again it   
 could be the door was blocked up for  
 some completely mundane reason!!!!!!
