 children of our area.                 
 ADULTS                                
 As we have discovered before, many of 
 the people who live in Pelsall in 1985
 have moved to the village from the    
 surrounding districts.(See POPULATION 
 -page 1)This fact is shown by people  
 living in our area.Nearly every school
 and many which are no longer existence
 were attended by the adults.          
       As expected when looking at the 
 children living in Pelsall NOW we     
 found that the great majority attended
 the nearest schools which are our     
 school- Pelsall Junior -the           
 neighbouring Pelsall Infants and      
 Pelsall Comprehensive.There are though
 quite a number of children who each   
 morning go out of Pelsall for their   
 education.                            
                                       </content>
