 then brushed my teeth and got changed 
 and ate my breakfast .Then I went to  
 school in my mams car then I saw a    
 film and later talked about it.After  
 first playtime I worked I did some    
 maths about circumference and diameter
 then dinner time came.For dinner I had
 tomato,peas,fish and cheese scones    
 after that we had pudding which was   
 biscuits with cream and a cherry on   
 the biscuit.After dinner and last     
 playtime I had to work.For the work I 
 did some maths with a story which was 
 about sets also I did some topic about
 the human body then at half past three
 which was home time I walked home with
 one of my brothers.At about half past 
 four one of my friends called for     
 me.He was in my brothers class.
