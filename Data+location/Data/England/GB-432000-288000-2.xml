 coal mine where the Tenlons Road      
 Industrial Estate has now been built  
 (04340290).In this same square the    
 Arbury View Estate has been built on  
 what was fields and allotments.The    
 Glendale Estate has been built on the 
 site of an old brickyard.In square    
 04350289 the Griff Arm canal used to  
 be a stopping place for barges picking
 up coal from the local mines.In square
 04340289 there used to be a lot of    
 clay holes that have now been filled  
 in.The clay had been used for the     
 brickyards which have now been        
 demolished.In square 04340288 there is
 now an industrial estate starting to  
 develop (Griff Clara).In square
