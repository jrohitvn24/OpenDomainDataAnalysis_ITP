		<content> Some of the  {graffiti}writings and   
 drawings which have recently been     
 appearing all over our area, are so   
 good that{Basildon Council}have given 
 permission for it to stay. The artist 
 is{Metso 46.}His drawing covers the   
 whole of a subway wall from floor to  
 ceiling.                              
 The graffiti artists have strange     
 names such as{Pony, Wiz, Jace and     
{Spark. Metso 46}seems to be king  of  
 the local graffiti writers. He has    
 been fined a few times in the past.   
 Until now all graffiti writing has    
 been{illegal.}One member of the gang  
 had to pay as much as Â£115.           
 The youths are now trying to persuade 
{Basildon Council}to give special      
{licences}to serious graffiti artists  
 so that it may be{legal.
