		<content> In a growing community such as this   
 village,there is bound to be great    
 pressure on the amenities.However,    
 whilst the nearest arts and sports    
 complexes are eight miles away in     
 Reading,the village succeeds in pro-  
 viding activities for all ages.       
  For the very young,there are the pop-
 ular Brownies,Bevers and Cubs,and dur-
 ing the summer,the Burghfield ,Ufton  
 and Mortimer Play Scheme (BUMPS) is   
 run at the Willink School.Older Child-
 ren can attend local dancing or riding
 classes,aswell as the local Scout and 
 Guide movements.Discos are common.    
  For the energetic,the "Burgfield 10" 
 road-race is held annually,and there  
 are also cricket and football teams.  
  The Volunteer Bureau provides activ- 
 ities for the older members of the    
 community,and a Day Centre at Bland's 
 Court also provides facilities.       </content>
