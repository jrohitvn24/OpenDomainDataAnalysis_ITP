		<content> This block is on the southern slopes  
 of{Bredon Hill.}It is a rural area of 
 great natural beauty.Most of the land 
 is farmed,although few people are     
 now employed on the land.A mixture of 
 crops is grown,including wheat,barley,
 potatoes,broad beans,oil seed rape,   
 linseed etc.There is considerable     
 deciduous tree cover,particularly on  
 the upper slopes of the hill and some 
 small coniferous plantations. There   
 are also large areas of permanent     
 pasture grazed by sheep, cattle and   
 horses.The main villages within the   
 area are{Overbury,Kemerton,Westmancote
{and Bredon's Norton.}These villages   
 contain numerous beautiful stone built
 houses. There are{Norman Churches at  
{Overbury and at Bredon's Norton,}where
 there is also a historic{Manor House.

 footpaths and is popular with walkers.</content>
