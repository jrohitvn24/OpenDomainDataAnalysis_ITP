		<title>08FARMING IN SUTTON</title>
		<content> There are 8 farms in the area.All but 
 one of these are of the arable or     
 market gardening variety.The reason   
 for this is that there are two types  
 of soil in the area-heavy clay which  
 is excellent for growing corn and     
 light,sandy soil-ideal for the growing
 of vegetables.At one time all the     
 farms belonged to the Burgoyne family 
 who came from France and settled in   
 Sutton in the 13th century.           
 Not long ago it took many people to   
 work the farms of Sutton but nowadays 
 most of the work is carried out by    
 machinery.The machinery used on farms 
 is very expensive.A combine harvester 
 costs anything between seventy and    
 eighty thousand pounds.
