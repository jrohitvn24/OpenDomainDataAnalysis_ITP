		<title>07St Annes - Tourist Interview</title>
		<content>     Tourists were interviewed in the  
 Square; People came from Oldham and   
 Scotland,others from Huddersfield,    
 Halifax and Gloucestershire.They were 
 attracted to St Annes because it was  
 peaceful,clean,a seaside area,had     
 plenty of shops,good bowling greens   
 and the golf courses.People who had   
 been here before noted improved       
 shopping facilities and a new         
 'image'.Two people felt there was less
 to do now.One complained that the     
 front was 'tatty'.Everyone was        
 enjoying themselves,particularly when 
 the weather was good.Most people said 
 there was enough to do in the daytime 
 but not at night.One would have liked 
 a theatre,another dancing.An elderly  
 man felt there was enough to do but a 
 middle-aged couple felt there was     
 enough,for a few days.                
                                       </content>
