 Saffron Walden is in N.W. Essex.      
 There are several farms and small     
 villages around though none of the    
 villages fall into our 12 sq.km.      
 Most of the farms concentrate on grain
 production.  There is also some dairy 
 and beef farming. There used to be a  
 pig market and cattle market in the   
 town. Both of these are now closed.   
 The farmers send their animals to     
 larger markets outside the town.      
 Most of the people who live in the    
 area no longer work in agriculture.   
 The farms need only a few workers     
 because of the use of machines.
