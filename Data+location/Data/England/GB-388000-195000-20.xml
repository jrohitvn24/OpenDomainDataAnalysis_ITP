		<content>    The earliest memory we found, was  
 of 1910, when the first 'bus was      
 driven from {Nailsworth}to {Avening.}A
 few years later this road was widened.
 This was a dramatic {EVENT}as cranes  
 and bulldozers broke up the rock above
 Longford's Lake opposite Gatcombe Park
 now the home of{HRH Princess Anne.}   
    In August 1950 seven skeletons were
 found in our top school playground    
 which was being excavated to make it  
 larger. One man put his pick through  
 the skull of one of the skeletons. An 
 expert said they were "sub-Roman" and 
 prove that people lived in this {     
{VILLAGE}1500 years ago!               
    In recent times Avening was        
 flooded, even the{SCHOOL}did not      
 escape the effects with desks floating
 in water. In 1979 a coach failed to   
 stop at the bottom of Tetbury Hill and
 went straight through a wall.         </content>
