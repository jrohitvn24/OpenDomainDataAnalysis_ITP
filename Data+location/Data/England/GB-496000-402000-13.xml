		<title>13Sargents Ice Cream 2</title>
		<content> Milk that was once available in the   
 village now comes from outside,approx 
 imately 70 gallons every day delivered
 in churns.We found out how ice-cream  
 was made.Milk was put in a pasteurisor
 to kill the bacteria.It was then      
 transfered to the freezers and        
 ingredients added and mixed together  
 taking 40 minutes.It was then placed  
 in large freezers until ready for use.
 Each day 100 gallon batches is made up
 for use within a few days or the      
 flavour would be impaired.The company 
 has competition from the manufacturers
 and retailers in Scunthorpe but they  
 produce different sorts.Links between 
 conpany personel and the local        
 community are strong although there is
 a rapid turnover in staff.There are   
 some points of conflict with cars in  
 the summer time.Despite this the owner
 hopes to expand in the future.        </content>
