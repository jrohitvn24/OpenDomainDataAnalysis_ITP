		<content>{SANDHURST}itself dates back to a      
 settlement of Saxon origin on the     
 banks of the Blackwater - this was    
 called "Hurst".  During the reign of {
{Henry VIII}the breeding of sheep was  
 introduced into the area.  Part of the
 area marks an extremity of Windsor    
 Forest, and it is said that {George   
{III}owned a hunting lodge here.       
{Little Sandhurst,}which has the       
 nicknam "Cock-a-doby", is an area     
 close to Sandhurst which it is        
 rumoured was  originally occupied by  
 gypsies and railway workers. There are
 several references to cock fighting in
 local area and house names. Since the 
 late 1950's there has been a large    
 amount of housing development, and the
 area is almost exclusively "commuter  
 belt". There are no main ameneties or 
 shopping facilities in Little         
 Sandhurst.                            </content>
