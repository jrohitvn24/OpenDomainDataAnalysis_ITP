		<title>16Living on a new estate</title>
		<content>  I live in{Thornton's Way}on the new  
{Grove Farm estate.}On the nearby      
 Kingswood Road there is a Spar shop,  
 an old peoples home, a social club    
 which has now closed and a new pub.   
 Opposite the club there is some       
 wasteland where they intend to build a
 doctor's surgery, a chemist amd some  
 shops - so it won't be so far to go to
 the doctor's.                         
  The area is all right but there are a
 few{vandals}around who spoiled my     
 mum's battery car and write on car    
 windows and walls. There are two      
{playgrounds,}one for younger children 
 and one for older. There is a{Post    
{Office}and some other shops at the top
 of the hill but it's a long way for   
 the{old people.}The houses are not    
 very well built especially the windows
 which are very easy to open from the  
 outside. (12 year old schoolgirl)     </content>
