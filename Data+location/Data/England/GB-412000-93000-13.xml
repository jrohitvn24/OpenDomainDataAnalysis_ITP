		<content> The two local rivers,the Hampshire    
 Avon and the Dorset Stour are famous  
 nationally for the quality of their   
 game and coarse fishing. Much of the  
 fishing is strictly private, but      
 day-tickets can be purchased for two  
 of the most famous fisheries, the     
 Royalty Fisheries on the Avon and     
 Throop Fisheries on the Stour. The two
 rivers vary considerably in character:
 the Avon being a steady flowing,      
 spring fed, chalkstream; the Stour is 
 more responsive to rainfall, liable to
 rise quickly after heavy rain. Both   
 rivers are very weedy, the Avon though
 has its weed cut in the summer- a     
 practice which most anglers believe   
 has a detrimental effect on the       
 quality of the fishing. Salmon and    
 sea-trout migrate up both rivers.     
 Coarse fish include large barbel,     
 chub, roach,pike,dace and perch.      </content>
