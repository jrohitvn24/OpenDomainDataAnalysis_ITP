		<content>     Along the one main road in the    
 area, the A16 between Boston and      
 Louth, there are buses on only two    
 days each week, Wednesday and         
 Saturday, and then only one each way. 
     The houses and villages on country
 lanes in the area, are served by a    
 daily post-bus.  It is not used much  
 as times are awkward and most people  
 have their own transport.             
     Only two households make regular  
 use of the bus to Louth for shopping  
 trips.                                
     There is not even an ambulance    
 service for hospital out-patients.  A 
 volunteer car service is used instead.
