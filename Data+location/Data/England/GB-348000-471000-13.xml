    Miss Mabel Barton, daughter of a   
local 19th. century worthy, used to    
ride her horse up the crag with her two
dogs. She loved the crag so much that  
she asked to be buried there with her  
animals which were duly shot on her    
death. It is said that her ghost haunts
the crag along with horse and dogs. The
family home, now an hotel, is also said
to be haunted by an unknown ghost.     
    A stone monolith in the new school 
field was possibly a pointer to Yealand
henge in ancient times. The pointer was
knocked off by a builder in 1970.  In  
1980 the Deputy Head wrote a play about
it around a girl called Hannah who was 
turned to stone. Children now call it  
the Hannah Stone and so was born a new 
legend.                                
    In 1985 a small USA flag was stolen
from a Washington display in church.   </content>
