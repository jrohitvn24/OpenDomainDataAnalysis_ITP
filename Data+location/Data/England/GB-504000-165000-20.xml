		<content> The area lacks large-scale industrial 
 development, but within it there are  
 many large factories and works e.g.   
 Plesseys . There is a variety of light
 industry in several Trading Estates,  
 making goods ranging from foods to car
 headlights.                           
 There are relatively easy             
 transportation facilities for         
 high-value, low bulk goods and there  
 is an abundant labour force available 
 locally. The whole labour force is not
 utilised within the area, so some     
 people must travel to work in the     
 city of London or elsewhere in the    
 county.                               
 Recent developments, including the    
 M25, will hopefully encourage further 
 industries into the area, especially  
 in the quarternary sector.
