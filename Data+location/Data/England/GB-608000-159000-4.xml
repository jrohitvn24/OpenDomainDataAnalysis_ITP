		<content> Our area is three-quarters covered by 
 woodland of a mixed variety.          
 Oak, fir,beech,hornbeam,hazel,elm,ash 
 wild service,hawthorne and sweet      
 chestnut abound.  The trees are       
 managed in two ways; coppicing and    
 clearance with planting.              
 Ground cover is plentiful with mainly 
 fern under the tree canopy and wood-  
 land plants along the paths.          
 The area is undulating with some      
 small streams running away from the   
 hills cutting fairly deep gullies in  
 places.                               
 The woods are traversed by several    
 footpaths varying from wide swathes to
 narrow trails which are often         
 reclaimed by nature.                  
 Part of Church Wood is a Nature       
 Resverve and the R.S.P.B. has a       
 designated area.
