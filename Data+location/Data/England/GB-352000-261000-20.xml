		<title>20Local Issues</title>
		<content> The main concern of people in this    
 rural area is the diminishing level of
 services.In the past decade two local 
 schools have closed,a post office and 
 shop have disappeared and public      
 transport has almost ceased to exist. 
     The increase in traffic is another
 worry. A 40mph speed limit has been   
 recently introduced in Kimbolton      
 following local pressure and a        
 footpath for the schoolchildren has   
 been partially completed after much   
 concern over the danger of walking    
 alongside the main road.              
     Residents of Leysters have        
 protested about a proposal to create  
 slurry pits for storage of waste      
 matter from a local factory prior to  
 its distribution on fields.These and  
 other issues reflect a growing        
 awareness of the need to improve the  
 quality of life.                      </content>
