		<content> Our D. block is 5 miles south of      
 Newcastle and 1O miles north of       
 Durham. It is crossed north, south by 
 an important road which used to be the
 A.1. before the new road, the A69T was
 built. This new road keeps to the     
 higher land to the east away from the 
 town centre. Also running vertically  
 across the area is the main East Coast
 Railway which uses the flat river     
 valley of the River Team. The road is 
 lined by factories shops and houses,  
 most of the housing being found to the
 higher land in the east. The east is  
 more heavily populated therefore than 
 the west where most of the population 
 live at Kibblesworth. Mixed farming is
 carried out in the central and western
 areas of D. block. The largest single 
 industry is Durham Chemicals.
