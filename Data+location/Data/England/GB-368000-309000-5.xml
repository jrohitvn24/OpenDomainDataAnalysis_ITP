 _____________                         
 Rev. C. Hart became the vicar at      
 Wombridge in December 1982. Before    
 this he lived in Sheffield where he   
 used to teach. He likes being a vicar 
 but when he was a boy it was the      
 last thing he wanted to do. His       
 ambition, then, was to be an          
 army officer!                         
                                       
 Mr.Arnold, Headmaster.
