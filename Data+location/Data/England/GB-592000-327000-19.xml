		<title>19Pudding Norton Hall Farm</title>
		<content> This farm covers about 1.66 sq. Kms.  
 of our block, and once included the   
 land where Fakenham Racecourse and the
 Sports Centre now stand. This year the
 fields are mostly down to cereal crops
 (barley and wheat) and sugar beet.    
 There is also a small acreage of grass
 for silage, and some rough grass for  
 grazing. A small herd of cattle are   
 kept but the Charolais bull was sent  
 to market earlier this year. There are
 3 small deciduous woods on the part of
 the farm in our block, and a row of   
 trees lining the drive to the hall.   
 There are 2 farm cottages and several 
 barns and outbuildings. Near the farm 
 buildings are the remains of Pudding  
 Norton village and the ruins of St.   
 Mary's Church. This area is grassed   
 and no cultivation is allowed. There  
 are 2 ponds near the farm buildings   
 and 2 streams (1 the E.boundary).     </content>
