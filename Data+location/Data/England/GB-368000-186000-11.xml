		<title>11Farming, Rangeworthy</title>
		<content>{In this area, the farmland}is mostly  
 pasture on which are kept sheep,      
 milking cows and a few beef cattle.   
{The farms are of medium to small size,
 ranging from 250 hectares down to 19  
 hectares which is the size of the     
 smallest farm we recorded.            
{This is how a local farmworker        
 described his work. On his farm, there
 are 3 full time workers for a farm of 
 250 hectares. They use lots of        
 machinery, for example:tractors, a    
 plough, a combine harvester, a        
 sprayer, a mower, a bailer, a "muck   
 spreader" and milking equipment.      
{The livestock}consists of sheep, cows 
 and beef cattle. To feed them they use
 hay, barley, oats and artificial      
 foodstuffs.                           
{The busiest time}is from May through  
 to September, particularly June and   
 July, when there is haymaking.        </content>
