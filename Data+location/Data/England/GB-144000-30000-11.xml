		<title>11PENZANCE CATTLE MARKET.</title>
		<content>  We all went to Penzance Cattle Market
 with our teacher.There were lots of   
 lorries.The auctioneer was speaking so
 fast we did not understand him.       
  A man was unloading the cows.They    
 were mooing.We saw some sheep being   
 weighed on the big scales.Then they   
 put them in a pen.                    
  Their fur was deep and greasy.They   
 sniffed our hands.We saw some{Hereford
 cows with white faces and horns,and   
 some{Friesian}cows.They were black and
 white. They had big udders full of    
 milk.                                 
  We loved the calves.The man put some 
 glue on their backs and stuck a       
 number on.They had lots of straw to   
 lie on.                               
  We enjoyed our visit.Soon the market 
 will be moved to a place outside the  
 town.
