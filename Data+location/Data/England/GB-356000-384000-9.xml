		<title>09FARMING 2</title>
		<content> The investigators were surprised to   
 discover that only one out of the ten 
 farms,{Rose Farm,}had a dairy herd,one
 of 25 cows.Only 3 of the farms kept   
 cattle for beef.These were bought in  
 early in the year and sold in Autumn. 
 It was also noticeable that only a few
 of the farmers kept chickens etc. for 
 their own use.The main crops grown    
 were wheat,barley,oats,potatoes and   
 peas. One new crop,{oil seed rape,}had
 been introduced in the past two years.
 Hay  was made in the traditional way  
 on most farms but Upper Moss Side Farm
 had started a new venture.They had    
 sold their field of grass to a        
 contractor.He had cut the grass,taken 
 it away and made it into small grass  
 cubes for animal food.All the farms   
 had shed workers in the past few years
 The work is mainly done by owners who 
 hire casual workers at busy times.    </content>
