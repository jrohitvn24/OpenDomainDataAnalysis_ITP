		<content> The school was built in 1867. It was a
 church school and was for boys only.  
 The Girls' School was added later and 
 the Infants' School later still.      
 One of our Governers came into school 
 to tell us what it was like when he   
 was here in 1928. Then children left  
 at the age of 14. They could go to the
 Grammar School if they were selected  
 and then they left at 16 years old.   
 Today there are 361 children in the   
 school. The largest class contains 39 
 children. There are 15.5 teachers (the
 0.5 only works during the summer      
 term.) The secretary works for 4 days 
 a week. There is a caretaker (full    
 time) and 2 cleaners who work for     
 14.75 hours per week.
