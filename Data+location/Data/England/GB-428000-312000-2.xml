		<title>02The Ashby Canal.</title>
		<content>   The Ashby canal,originally,some 30  
 miles in length,was constructed to    
 carry coal from the South Derbyshire  
 coal field.It now survives in a       
 shortened form as a recreational      
 amenity.                              
   The canal was established as a      
 result of the initiative of the second
 Earl of Moira who stood to gain from  
 the cheaper carriage of coal from his 
 Moira collieries.                     
   The Canal was started at Moira,some 
 8 miles south of Burton_on_Trent in   
 1794 and reached the Coventry canal in
 1804.It followed the natural contours 
 of the land but encountered           
 difficulties such as the dispute with 
 the right honourable Penn Asherton    
 Curzon of Gopsall who insisted that   
 the line of the canal be re_routed so 
 as not to interfere with plans for    
 extending his hunting pack.           </content>
