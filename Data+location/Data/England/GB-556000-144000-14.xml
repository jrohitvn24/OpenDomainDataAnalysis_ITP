		<content> During the 19 C the town was a centre 
 for agriculture but the coming of a   
 railway in 1842 provided many new     
 jobs.It also contributed to the demise
 of the Medway Company causing the     
 gradual loss of all work connected    
 with river transport.Around the       
 beginning of the 20th C Tonbridge     
 became a stronghold for the printing  
 trade providing employment for over   
 one thousand of its inhabitants but in
 reason years declined.There has been a
 brickworks in the town since Victorian
 times and nowdays the company         
 specialises in handmade bricks.Since  
 the late 1960's there has been a      
 further change in the type of         
 available employment brought about by 
 the establishment of a trading estate 
 where various forms of light industry 
 are to be found.
