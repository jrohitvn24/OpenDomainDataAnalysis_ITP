		<title>19 Arthur Evans - Boars Hill</title>
		<content>    Sir Arthur Evans, an archeologist  
of note, lived on Boars Hill until his 
death in 1942. Sir Arthur took a keen  
interest in the young people of the    
area. In 1926 he created a "wild       
garden" to become known as Jarn Mound  
so that young people could explore     
nature. Jarn Mound still exists today  
and is a popular spot for visitors. In 
1913 Sir Arthur donated 40 acres of his
estate for the benefit of young people,
particularly the Scouting Movement.    
Known as Youlbury Camp, it accommodate 
up to 600 scouts at a time and provides
week end &amp; summer camps for scouts from
all over the country. Facilities       
include archery, climbing, swimming,   
canoing and small bore shooting. There 
is a nature trail and an "Oxford" trail
where scouts are given an opportunity  
to explore Oxford.
