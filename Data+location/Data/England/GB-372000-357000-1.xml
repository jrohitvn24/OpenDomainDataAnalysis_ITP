		<content>  The area covered by our block is     
 mainly{Cheshire}farmland. The main    
 road running from North to South      
 connects{Crewe}with the market town of
{Sandbach}and the M6. There is a       
 village,{Wheelock}where the canal and 
 old railway crosses the road, and two 
 small hamlets,{Wheelock Heath}and     
{Winterley}further South.              
                                       
  There used to be salt-mining in the  
 area but all that is left are the     
 Flashes where water has filled in the 
 holes. There are two factories left   
 and twenty eight farms.               
  There are two new housing estates in 
 the area, one in Wheelock and the     
 other in Winterley.                   
  The land is mostly low lying and     
 flat.
