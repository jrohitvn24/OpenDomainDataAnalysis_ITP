		<title>19FARMING AROUND BURY AREA</title>
		<content> Mr. E. Lambert has lived in Ramsey all
 his life and has been farming for     
 about 40 years.He owns 27.5 hectres of
 land on which he grows                
 potatoes,cereals and sugar beet.His   
 family helps with all the work so he  
 does'nt employ farm hands.He owns     
 Â£30000 worth of eqiupment.He spends   
 about Â£2500 on fertiliser per year.   
 Mr.Lambert inherited some of the farm,
 he bought some of it and he also rents
 a couple of fields.When he retires the
 farm will be split and sold.He is not 
 employed by the government.COMMON     
 MARKET.It was good at first but now he
 thinks it is bad.We import more than  
 we export.Alot of our surpluss food is
 either destroyed or given to Russia.  
 The French have more money than the   
 English out of the Common Market      
 because they can't farm.
