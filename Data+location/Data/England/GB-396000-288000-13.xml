		<title>13ECOLOGICAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>  This was carried out in May 1985 in  
 the central part of Oldbury. This area
 included a school playing field and   
 an area which was awaiting            
 development. Identification of many   
 specimens was quite straightforward   
 but some presented problems due to    
 their underdevelopment following the  
 late cold spring. In total some 41    
 different plants were found, of which 
 36 were positively identified and 5   
 were loosely identified. List: Bush   
 Vetch, Burdock, Honesty, Groundsel,   
 Black Mustard, Broad-leafed dock,     
 Scentless Mayweed, Coltsfoot, Ribwart,
 Hoary Plantain, Mugwort, Black Medic, 
 Oxford Ragwort, Rosebay Willowherb,   
 White Deadnettle, Bramble, Sheep's    
 Sorrel, Red Clover, White Clover,
