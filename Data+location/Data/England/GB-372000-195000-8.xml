		<content> Religion is a fairly important part of
 life in North Nibley as it is a centre
 for the community which is mainly     
 retired senior citizens. The weekly   
 attendance of the church is about 50. 
 This mainly consists of older and     
 middle aged people, with very few     
 youngsters. Many of the residents do  
 not find time to attend church,       
 although they were brought up as part 
 of the Church of England. The Rev.    
 Fookes is the vicar of the small but  
 beautiful 15th Century medieval       
 church,St.Martin's.Canon Hoskins is   
 the rector of Saint Mark's church in  
 Woodmancote. Again the regular weekly 
 attendants to the church are mostly   
 senior citizens. There was proposal to
 close the church but this was resisted
 by those who felt a greater loyalty to
 it than to the nearby parish church.
