		<title>03Tetsworth Parish Church</title>
		<content>There is evidence of a church building 
in Tetsworth since medieval times, but 
the present building dates from 1844.  
The church, dedicated to St.Giles,     
stands on a hill overlooking the       
parish. It was probably paid for by a  
vicar of the parish who is remembered  
by a plaque inside the church. There   
are three parts to the church. The     
tower, on the south side, has six      
bells. The nave is the largest part and
simply furnished. A record in the      
vestry shows the number of seats in the
church. The appropriated seats         
still have doors on them. The other    
pews (free and children's) do not have 
doors and are not so roomy. The Chancel
is small and contains choir stalls and 
the altar. The east window is a stained
glass window and describes when Jesus  
went to heaven for ever. In the nave is
a two manual organ.                    </content>
