		<content>  I go to guides every Wednesday at    
 7.30pm till 9.00pm.  Our{uniform      
 consists of a navy blue skirt, a navy 
 blouse, a red neckchief and a plaited 
 leather waddle.  We can wear any shoes
 we like.  In each pack we have        
 different groups called{Patrols.} The 
 Patrols have names, our patrols are   
 called Scarlet pimpernel, Bluebell,   
 White heather and Primrose.           
  Our troup are celebrating{75 years}of
 Guiding at a place called Marheaton   
 Park in Derbyshire.  We will dress in 
 old Guide costumes and will have a    
 games store and later on a camp fire. 
 This will be lit by a flame brought   
 from Princess Margaret.  In July 1985 
 we went to{Peak '85 at Chatsworth.    
 There was dry Skiing, Canoeing, Hang  
 Gliding and lots more.
