		<content>  Our town was, in a way, created one  
 hundred million years ago in the      
 Jurassic period of geological history 
 when most of England was covered by   
 sea. The sea was rich in tiny sea     
 creatures like oolites. When England  
 was lifted a great band of limestone  
 was exposed. The oolitic limestone is 
 sometimes called Bath stone and was   
 quarried all around Bradford. The     
 shelly limestone is used in our school
 wall. Our town is a mellow golden     
 yellow colour because it is made from 
 limestone. Limestone is quite soft and
 it is damaged by acid rain and car    
 fumes.                                
  The River Avon has cut a steep sided 
 valley through the town and there are 
 underground streams and caverns       
 beneath our town.
