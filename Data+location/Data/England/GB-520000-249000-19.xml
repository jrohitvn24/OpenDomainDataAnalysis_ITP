		<title>19RECREATION: GAMES AND SPORT</title>
		<content> I like playing{French Skipping}because
 it is a nice game. You need three     
 people to play French Skipping. Two   
 people have to stand  in the ends of  
 the elastic or tights. The person who 
 is doing French Skipping has to make  
 up a few jumps to do on and over the  
 elastic. There  are different sections
 to do. There is normals, double       
 jumpsies, hopsies and blindsies.      
   My favourite sport is{swimming}in   
 the summer. It is nice because it     
 keeps you  cool. I like splashing in  
 the water so it goes all over you and 
 I like going under the water and      
 coming back up again .When we have to 
 go out of the swimming pool I say,    
 "Can we have five more minutes?"      
 So when five minutes have gone I say, 
 "I just want one more little swim."   
 Then we get out and have some crisps  
 or something to eat.                  </content>
