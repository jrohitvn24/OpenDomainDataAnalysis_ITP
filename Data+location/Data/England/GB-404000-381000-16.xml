		<title>16Chinley Brownies</title>
		<content> I am a Brownie in the 2nd Chinley     
 pack. We play games and have challenge
 groups to win badges.                 
 Our Guides Mrs Hobson and Brown Owl,  
 Mrs Hughes are teaching us to march   
 for the Derby Cavalcade to celebrate  
 seventy five years of Brownies and    
 Guides. I am getting very nervous and 
 my tummy feels as though it is a bag  
 of gob-stoppers rumbling.             
 There are rules. You must sew all your
 badges on your uniform in the right   
 place and borrow a hat if you haven't 
 got one. There is a man coming in to  
 teach us how to march - left, right,  
 left, right. Then we are to go up     
 Eccles Pike to light seventy five     
 candles on the Birthday cake.
