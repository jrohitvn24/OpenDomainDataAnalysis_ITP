		<content> In a region rich in history, Ham is   
 the only place mentioned in Domesday  
 Book. The remains of the most ancient 
 monument are those of a Romano-British
 Temple lying under the surface near   
 the end of Jubilee Road, Worth. Many  
 people from outside the village are   
 seen with metal detectors and, sadly, 
 any finds are removed by them though  
 occasionally Roman coins are found in 
 nearby gardens.                       
 "Igguldene" at Burgess Green was the  
 Toll House on the old Deal/Sandwich   
 road which can still be followed      
 through Finglesham and Ham to join the
 present road at Worth Cross Roads.    
 Cottington Court Farm is built on the 
 ruins of Cotmanton Monastery. The sea 
 which in 1446 came up to the back of  
 the chapel is now 2km. away to the    
 east.
