		<title>15Churches - Hempnall Group</title>
		<content>    The parishes of{Morningthorpe,     
{Shelton and Fritton}are part{of the   
{Hempnall Group of eight parishes.}The 
 Group is served by two full time      
 clergymen and two non - stipendiary   
 priests.There is one service at least 
 in every church every sunday,except   
 the first of the month when all joined
 together for a Group Service.In 1985  
 the Group celebrated its 21st         
 anniversary  with a festival including
 exhibitions in every church, a        
 pilgrimage around all 8 churches and a
 party. Shelton church is a fine       
 building with splendid acoustics.     
 Concerts are held there by candlelight
 in the Winter.The tower of Fritton    
 church has recently undergone many    
 repairs, carried out by a local       
 craftsman. The cost of repairs to all 
 churches is increasing and with small 
 congregations their future is in doubt</content>
