		<title>02VERNHAM STREET &amp; LITTLEDOWN</title>
		<content> Vernham Street &amp; Littledown are       
 probably the oldest part of the       
 district  as the church &amp; the Tudor   
 Manor House are in the vicinity.      
 Littledown is a hamlet with old flint 
 &amp; brick houses, a pub The Boot,and a  
 small chapel in which services are    
 held once a week. The social          
 activities are all integrated with    
 Vernham Dean in the village Hall.     
 There is a small riding school and    
 farm with several acres of grazing    
 land. A smallholding with 15 acres    
 rearing calves and sheep and the      
 remainder of the hamlet is private    
 residential housing.                  
 Vernham Dean, now the main village,   
 was probably very much smaller because
 the meaning of 'dean' is 'the valley  
 of'. Vernham Street was probably the  
 main village 400 years ago.
