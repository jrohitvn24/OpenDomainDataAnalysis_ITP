		<content> Manufacturing industry has declined in
 the south-west of the block during    
 recent years.  A number of factories  
 stand empty. One such factory belonged
 to Rank Kershaw and had been extended 
 only a few years before its closure.  
 This factory was once a leading       
 producer of precision optical         
 equipment.Another factory just across 
 Harehills Lane has been extensively   
 altered and transformed into a "do it 
 yourself" supermarket. An industrial  
 estate for small businesses has been  
 built on Ashton Road. Each unit is    
 large enough for light industries,    
 employing a handful of people. Some   
 other industrial premises on Harehills
 Lane have been converted to offer high
 technology training in electronics and
 computers to young people and women.  
 In this way, it is hoped, local will  
 benefit from advanced technology.     </content>
