 covering all aspects of industry,     
 primary,secondary and tertiary.The    
 small,versatile,self-contained        
 industrial units provide work for     
 approximately 20 employees each on a  
 full-time basis.The local Primary     
 School and Nursery unit supplies      
 tertiary employment for approximately 
 10 teachers and auxiliary staff.      
 Farming provides full_time and        
 seasonal employment for the           
 inhabitants.Much of the population,   
 including many women, who work in     
 Brompton,are employed on a part_time  
 basis particularly in leisure         
 connected industries.The majority of  
 the work_force is employed outside of 
 its own residential area,usually      
 within a 30mile radius. Northallerton,
 Darlington and Teesside provide       
 employment for many people.           </content>
