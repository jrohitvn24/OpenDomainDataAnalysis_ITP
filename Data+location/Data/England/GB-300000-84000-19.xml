		<title>19SCHOOL SURVEY</title>
		<content>   A survey was carried out among all  
 139 children at St. Peter's school.The
 main results are on page 20.          
  The results show that most children  
 come from fairly affluent homes.This  
 is not surprising as the school is    
 private and the parents pay for the   
 education (average cost Â£2700 for a   
 boarding pupil, Â£2000 for a daypupil  
 per year)                             
  School meals are cooked on the       
 premises and two cooks are employed.  
 The school also employs 11 teaching   
 staff , a bursar, a matron , 5        
 domestic staff and the headmaster's   
 wife.                                 
  The children generally enjoy school  
 and the varied activities that take   
 place at St. Peter's.
