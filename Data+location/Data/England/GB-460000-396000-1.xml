		<title>01ROSSINGTON, SOUTH YORKSHIRE.</title>
		<content>     The region surveyed is 7/12 rural,
 1/3 residential and 1/12 coal mining. 
     It is a low lying area through    
 which flows the River Torne, tributary
 of the River Trent.  Rossington is a  
 very large residential village with a 
 population of 12,750 (1981). It is 6  
 miles south of the Metropolitan       
 Borough of Doncaster of which it is   
 part.                                 
     The name Rossington derives from  
 Rushington meaning marshy ground.  In 
 Roman times there was a fort and the  
 Littleworth area was referred to in   
 the Doomsday Book as Scitelfuuorde.   
     Until 1912 the region was rural,  
 the pit was then sunk and the village 
 grew rapidly. The pit area is referred
 to as New Rossington ,though now some 
 of the newest houses are in private   
 estates in the original village       
 centred around St Michael's church.   </content>
