		<title>10LONGSTANTON VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The{old National school}of 1848 served
 the village until the late 1940's,    
 when the arrival of RAF families      
 brought many new children to the area.
 Before long Infant children filled    
 both rooms of the old school, and the 
 Juniors were taught in a hut on the   
 Airfield.                             
 In 1953 the{present school in         
{Hatton Park}opened with 4 classrooms, 
 but already the population had        
 outgrown it and one class had to      
 stay in the old school. Over the next 
 10 years 5 more classrooms and a      
 second hall were added _ with the     
 result that the school is now very    
 adequate for the 211 children         
 attending it.                         
 Indeed, we consider our classrooms the
 equal of any around, and our grounds, 
 play areas, the animal enclosure and  
 pond, quite unsurpassed anywhere.     </content>
