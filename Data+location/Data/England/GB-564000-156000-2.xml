   West Malling is a small country town
 and in the last decade the pattern has
 changed, small businesses such as     
 drapers, ironmongers and grocers have 
 closed owing to the fact that         
 supermarkets have sprung up in the    
 district and taken the trade. If this 
 trend continues it will prove         
 difficult for elderly and infirm      
 inhabitants to do their shopping.     
 restaurants, art shops and building   
 societies have sprung up. Recently the
 High Street has been resurfaced with a
 brick pattern which improves the look 
 of it, appearing to be more           
 spacious.through traffic is very      
 heavy, this may be lessened once the  
 proposed bypass has been built. Bus   
 services go to neighbouring towns and 
 trains provide  service to London.    </content>
