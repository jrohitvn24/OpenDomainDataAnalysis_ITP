		<title>03COMMUNITY POLICE BARNSTAPLE.</title>
		<content> Some of our area is policed by a      
 community {Policeman,}here is a       
 description of his job. The {Policeman
 has about 20 square miles to cover.   
 He does this by car.He and his family 
 live within the area he is responsible
 for.He enjoys his job sometimes but it
 can get risky when you do certain     
 areas on your own and you're under    
 pressure. He has 10500 people to      
 police.The{Policeman}hates shiftwork. 
 Some mornings he gets up at 5.30 am.  
 and works till 1.30 pm.He works 40    
 hours a week altogether.He does an 8  
 hour shift for 5 days a week.He thinks
 community policing works best on a    
 small scale.Here it is different from 
 other police forces because you don't 
 seem to be at the "sharp end" of      
 things.He would improve his force by  
 equipping it with a helicopter and    
 more sea rescue crafts.               </content>
