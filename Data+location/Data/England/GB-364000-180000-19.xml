		<title>19Chestnut Farm. Coalpit Heath</title>
		<content> The farmer uses a variety of equipment
 in his work including three tractors, 
 trailers, a mower,a baler, a loader   
 and a fertilizer spreader. One of the 
 things they do on the farm is make    
 silage. Silage is pickled grass and is
 used for animal feed during the       
 winter. This material is made in a    
 silage pit.                           
 Mr. Poole has electric fences around  
 some of his fields. These prevent     
 animals from straying and breaking    
 into fields in which crops are        
 growing.
