		<title>11Aunt Sally</title>
		<content>Aunt Sally is a skittle type game      
played only in Oxfordshire. It has     
been played outside pubs for more than 
500 years.                             
To play the game you need an iron pole,
a dolly and six sticks. The 3 foot pole
supports the dolly or Aunt Sally which 
is painted white. The players throw the
sticks underarm from a platform or     
hocking to the dolly 30 feet away. If  
the sticks knocks the dolly cleanly off
the pole it is scored as a strike and  
a miss is a blob. When the eight       
people in each team have thrown their  
sticks the scores are added up for     
each leg or horse. There are three     
horses to a game but sometimes a       
fourth round or beer leg is played.    
Aunt Sally is taken very seriously in  
this area. Many pubs have players      
registered in area league. The season  
is from April to September.            </content>
