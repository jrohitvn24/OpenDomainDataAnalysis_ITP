		<content> The biggest employer of people in our 
 block is the Sheepskin Warehouse.The  
 Sheepskin Warehouse gets in wool from 
 New Zealand and Australia and they    
 make the wool into jumpers, coats,    
 slippers, gloves, hats, toys,         
 novelties, etc.They get some jumpers  
 from Guernsey and Shetland.They have  
 got several shops all over England.   
 They supply other shops in the Lake   
 District and Scotland.One of the shops
 they supply is the Edinburgh Woollen  
 Mill.Their warehouse and offices are  
 in our area.The Sheepskin Warehouse is
 owned by Mark Birrbeck and it is      
 sometimes called Mark Birkbeck &amp; Co.  
 They make fun things such as teddy    
 bears, little lambs, sheep, feather   
 dusters, little hairy animals and the 
 most crazy thing they make is a       
 Sheepskin belly-button warmer.
