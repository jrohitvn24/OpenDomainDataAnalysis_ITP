		<title>06THE LIGHTHOUSES.</title>
		<content>  About 1760 an old fisherman and his  
 wife lived near to the church. One    
 stormy night, worried about her       
 husband not coming home before dark,  
 his wife put a candle in the window of
 the cottage to help him find his way. 
 It saved his life! This was the first 
 lighthouse.                           
                                       
  About 100 years ago the tall         
 lighthouse on the Berrow Road was     
 built. It had a paraffin lamp and was 
 100 feet in height.                   
                                       
  It was not until after the building  
 was completed that they discovered    
 that too low a vantage point had been 
 selected to take into account the huge
 rise and fall of the tide at Burnham, 
 so a second lighthouse on legs was    
 built on the beach. These two are     
 known as the High Light and Low Light.</content>
