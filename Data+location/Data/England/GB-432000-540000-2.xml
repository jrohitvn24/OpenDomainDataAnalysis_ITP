		<content>      In Ludworth in the past,the      
 village                               
 looked different to now.The village   
 was smaller than it is now.           
      Ludworth Tower was used as a Peel
 Tower.The east and west walls of      
 Ludworth Tower collaspsed in 1890.All 
 that is left is a window and some     
 remains of a fireplace.North of       
 the Tower under ground there is a     
 tunnel vaulted floor and above it     
 there is a three storeyed wall.If you 
 dug around Ludworth Tower you would   
 probably find some antiquities under  
 ground.There is a sign outside        
 Ludworth Tower telling you all the    
 things that happened to it. The Tower 
 was built in about 1422.Ludworth Tower
 is presently in the care of the       
 district council, it is not a popular 
 ancient monument and receives few     
 visitors.                             </content>
