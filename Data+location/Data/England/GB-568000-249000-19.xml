		<title>19The Cock,Great Thurlow</title>
		<content>  The Cock public house in Thurlow was 
 built in 1614 and has always been a   
 pub.It was refronted in the 18th      
 century and modernised in the 20th    
 century.It is two storeys high and has
 a five -windowed range.               
   The Cock is said to have a ghost!   
 -John Savage-who died there in        
 unfortunate circumstances.Sometimes   
 the customers hear doors bang or see  
 them opening for no apparent reason.  
   The pub is owned by the Atherton    
 family who have a marvellous display  
 of horse-brasses on show.             
   During the week,customers are       
 usually people who live in the        
 village,but at the weekendsit attracts
 people from nearby towns and tourists.
   Some of the customers play in the   
 darts team,which is part of a local   
 league.
