		<title>05FOX FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content>  Fox Fruit is a local firm, which was 
 established as an orchard 16 years    
 ago. They produce a variety of apples 
 to give a succession of fruit from    
 September onwards. These varieties    
 include Katy,Discovery and Cox. In    
 1984 a new variety, developed by the  
 firm, was introduced onto the market. 
 This is called Fox Delight.Two        
 children from our school,Vicky Hinds  
 and Robert Cross were invited to take 
 part in a short newsreel film for     
 television.They  were filmed in the   
 orchard eating Fox Delight and were   
 then asked what it was like.The firm  
 also grows two varieties of pear,     
 Commis and Conference. All the fruit  
 produced is for the table and is sold 
 locally  or is sent to markets in this
 country.
