		<title>11Barton Village</title>
		<content>The village of Barton lies about five  
miles north of Preston in the county of
Lancashire.                            
                                       
Much of Barton is agricultural land,   
being used mainly as grazing for       
cattle and sheep. However, there is a  
ribbon of housing which straggles      
along the main road and spreads to the 
east in two small and seperate areas   
of modern housing. There is also an    
area, not included in this setion of   
the survey, which forms a large part   
of Broughton Village.                  
                                       
There is thus no centre to the         
village. Activities in the village     
centre on the village hall and the     
scout hut, both of which lie on the    
northern edge of this survey area.     
                                       
                                       </content>
