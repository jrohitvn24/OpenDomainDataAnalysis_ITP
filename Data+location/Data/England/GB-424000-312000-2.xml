		<content>   Much of the area is of Grade 3      
 agricultural land with pockets of     
 higher quality of Grade 2 land to the 
 north and east. As a result there is  
 considerable variety both in the size 
 and type of farms. In fact of the 9   
 farms included, 4 are mixed, 2 are    
 dairy farms, 2 rear beef cattle and 1 
 is arable.                            
   Several of the smaller farms are    
 family businesses, handed down through
 2 or 3 generations. For this reason   
 they do not employ farmworkers. The   
 larger farms do depend on outside help
 although the number of employees is   
 small compared to that of twenty      
 years ago. This explains why many     
 tied cottages have been sold to       
 people outside the farming industry.
