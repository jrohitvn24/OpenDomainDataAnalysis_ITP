 The Domesday Data is stored in our BBC
 microcomputer.Computers in schools are
 new,we have had our computer for a    
 year now.Our computer has a 32K Ram   
 memory and a 32K Rom memory it has a  
 keyboard it has connections for a tape
 recorder,a disc drive,a printer,and a 
 monitor.At first we had a tape        
 recorder,it took a long time to load  
 programs and made a lot of noise.Now  
 we have a disc drive it is quicker and
 quieter. We have a trolley and a      
 colour monitor. With the trolley we   
 can wheel it from class to class and  
 with the colour monitor we can see the
 graphics better.We asked the children 
 in our class if they had a computer at
 home .Just over half of them had.The  
 most popular are the BBC with 3       
 children and the Spectrum with 2 and  
 Dragon and Commador with 2 each.      </content>
