		<title>04Clayton Hall</title>
		<content>{Clayton Hall}is the only example of a 
{moated residence} remaining intact in 
 Manchester. The present hall, which is
 situated in the grounds of{Clayton    
{Park,}is probably the second or third 
 to occupy the site. The history of the
 hall dates from the{12th century}and  
 was built on the site of a house of a 
 branch of the{Byron family.}The Byrons
 lived at Clayton Hall until 1620 when 
 it was sold to{Humphrey Chetham,      
 founder of Chetham's Hospital.        
{Renovation work is in progress}prior  
 to opening to the public. Workmen said
 that they hoped to use some of the    
 original beams in the renovation. We  
 were also told of an old bell in the  
 wooden turret in the south side of the
 hall. It is said to be one of 4 taken 
 from from the old parish church of    
 Manchester when rebuilt in the 15th   
 century.                              </content>
