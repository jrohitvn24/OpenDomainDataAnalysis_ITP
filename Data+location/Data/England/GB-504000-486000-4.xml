		<title>04South Cliff Golf Course</title>
		<content> People like to play golf on their     
 holidays. Scarborough has two golf    
 courses and one of them,{South Cliff,}
 is in this area. Golf is a very       
 relaxing game and the South Cliff     
 course is set in beautiful coastal    
 scenery. You can become a member for  
 one hundred pounds. This entitles you 
 to use the club facilities and to play
 whenever you want, provided there is  
 no tournament on. Non-members must pay
 a green fee of seven pounds per round.
 In the large clubhouse there is a     
 ladies and gentlemen's locker room    
 with showers. There is a special      
 ladies lounge and a bar called {The   
{Nineteenth Hole.}There is also a T.V. 
 room and patio and a dining room      
 offering a choice of meals and snacks.
 The club has a professional player who
 gives lessons and sells equipment. It 
 also has five green-keepers.          </content>
