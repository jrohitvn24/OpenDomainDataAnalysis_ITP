		<content>{Q. Is this area a healthy place to    
{live?}                                
 A. Yes, it's certainly healthier than 
 the West Riding or Lancashire.        
{Q. Are there a lot more stress related
{illnesses than there used to be?}     
 A. Yes, particularly because of       
 increased unemployment and the        
 increased demand of employers. Where  
 people have seen their colleagues made
 redundant, they're often having to    
 work harder to secure their jobs, and 
 this can lead to their succumbing to a
 certain amount of stress.             
{Q. Apart from doctors, what other     
{services are provided by the health   
{centre for the public?}               
 A. Social Services provide a vast     
 range of services eg. home helps;     
 advice; providing apparatus for the   
 disabled etc.. District nurses provide
 nursing both at home and the centre.  </content>
