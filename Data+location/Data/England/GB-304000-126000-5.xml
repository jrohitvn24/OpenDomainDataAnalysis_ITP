 Mrs Stevens breeds Highland ponies and
 sometimes sells the ponies to France  
 and Scotland. Mrs Stevens owns 7      
 Highlands and 1 Dartmoor.             
                                       
 The land that they own is very steep  
 and hilly, however on it they grow    
 straw hay and silage. About mid July  
 they will start to cut the silage and 
 when it is all cut it is taken to a   
 silage pit where they pack it all down
 by running over it with the tractor.  
 After this has been done it is covered
 with  black plastic sheeting and      
 weighed down with old tyres. It is    
 left in the pit until the winter when 
 it is fed to all the animals.
