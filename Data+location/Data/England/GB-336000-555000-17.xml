		<title>17A DAY IN MY LIFE IN CARLISLE</title>
		<content>  I usually wake up with the radio     
 blaring out at about seven.Last Mon-  
 day was the same.I lay in bed reading 
 for half an hour before getting up.I  
 get washed before anyone else to avoid
 the bathroom queue.Then I go back to  
 my room and play on my computer while 
 the rest of the house gets up.They    
 have breakfast before I come down for 
 mine,usually soggy Rice Krispies.After
 that I go back upstairs and comb my   
 hair.I brush my teeth again and again,
 ready for school.                     
  When I got home from school I had    
 fish and chips for tea.I played       
 cricket in the back until six.Then I  
 went shopping with my mum and dad.When
 we got home I watched 'The Young Ones'
 on television.I went to bed and read  
 for a while.I couldn't get to sleep so
 I read again.At 11.30 I finally got to
 sleep.                                </content>
