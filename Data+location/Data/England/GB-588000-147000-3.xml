		<content>   Our social services office is in    
 Ashford which arranges a home help    
 service for those infirm or elderly   
 who need it. However, a Good Neighbour
 Scheme runs for the O.A.P.S of Elm    
 Close.  This is an arrangement whereby
 for a small stipend an able_bodied    
 neighbour drops in daily to each home 
 to find out if any help is needed,    
 shopping to be done or the doctor     
 called.  A great deal of help is also 
 given from friends and neighbours on  
 an informal level in the community to 
 those who need it.  From outside the  
 village come other very welcome       
 services: the mobile library which    
 stops in 3 places for 20 mins every   
 week and 2 hairdressers who visit on  
 request. The postmen, the milkman and 
 a mobile shop all help to complete the
 valuable services which keep Egerton a
 real community.                       </content>
