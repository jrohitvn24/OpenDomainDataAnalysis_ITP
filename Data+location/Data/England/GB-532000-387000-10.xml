		<title>10Crime Rate</title>
		<content> An interview at the police station    
 revealed that the crime rate in Louth 
 has fallen in recent years.The most   
 common crimes reported were thefts    
 burglary,and criminal damage.The least
 common crimes are rape and murder,the 
 last reported murder occurred about   
 seven years ago. Most criminals seem  
 to be in the 18 to 25 age group and   
 they are predominantly male, however, 
 female crimes are on the increase.    
  Despite the fall in the overall crime
 rate,drinking offences have increased 
 over the last year.In 1984 there were 
 43 reported drinking offences but in  
 1985 there have been 42 cases recorded
 up to the beginning of June.          
  The police station is situated on    
 Eastgate.It has one female and four   
 male cells for offenders.The cells are
 sometimes full,usually at weekends.
