		<content>{Holy Trinity Church}is the oldest     
 church in Nailsea Town, dating from   
 the last part of the 13th century. It 
 is for this reason that the area      
 around it, which includes our School, 
 is known as the Old Church area of    
 Nailsea. This was originally to       
 distinguish it from the "new" Church, 
{Christ Church}built in 1842 on the    
 other side of the Town.               
 This year,in March, the{new extension 
 to Holy Trinity Church was opened on  
 the north side of the church.         
 Also this year, work was started on   
 the new{Roman Catholic Church}of St.  
 Francis near the junction of Queen's  
 Road and Ash Hayes Road.              
 Two other places of worship in Nailsea
 are the{United Reformed Church}and the
{Methodist Chapel.}The 13th Cent.{St.  
{Bride's Church}in the tiny hamlet of  
 Chelvey is also in our survey area.   </content>
