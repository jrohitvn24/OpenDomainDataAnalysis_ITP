		<title>10Barclays Bank of New Milton</title>
		<content>  There are 5{banks}in our{D-Block}. We
 interviewed the manager of{Barclays   
{Bank}. He told us that the{bank}is    
 busiest on Mondays and Fridays when   
 they can expect to collect around     
 Â£100,000. The money is placed in a    
 strong room and there are 2 sequences 
 of numbers which open the combination 
 lock, of which the manager only knows 
 one.                                  
  The{bank}opens to the public at      
 9.30 a.m. and closes at 3.30 p.m. five
 days a week, but the manager told us  
 that the{bank}will shortly be opening 
 on Saturday mornings as well.         
{ Barclays Bank}is built on the site of
 an old cake shop, and in 1984 the{bank
{celebrated its 60th anniversary}.     
 They are about to extend the building 
 for {computers} and other machinery.
