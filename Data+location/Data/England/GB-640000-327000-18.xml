		<content> Shopping threatens to become a        
 necessary evil of modern life, rather 
 than a relaxed social outing, as it   
 was in days gone by.                  
{GARDENS ON THE NORFOLK COAST }        
 It is not easy to describe a typical  
 garden in this area,they vary greatly 
 in size.Some of the old cottages have 
 little more than a back yard.There are
 how ever several of about a quarter of
 an acre.Most people in the village    
 grow vegetables,some being almost     
 self supporting.However,the old       
 pattern of the man of the house       
 growing vegetables in the back garden 
 whilst his wife grew flowers in the   
 front is changing,particularly in the 
 new houses is given to ornament rather
 than to utility.Acquisition of plants,
 as everywhere a great deal of         
 exchanging of plants goes on in the   
 area,and plants stalls are popular.   </content>
