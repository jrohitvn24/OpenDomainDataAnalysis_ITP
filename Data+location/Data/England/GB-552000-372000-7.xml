		<content> St Leonard church was dedicated to    
 a French Nobleman and Patron Saint    
 of prisoners and peasants.There was a 
 flood in 1572 and the church was      
 rebuilt.Two hundred and fifty years   
 later it was in ruins.It was rebuilt  
 again in 1794 but much smaller,by     
 church warden Robert Empringham.For a 
 long time there were no regular       
 service only when there was money to  
 spare.The church was given some land  
 so that they could earn from it so    
 they could keep the church in repair. 
 The village hall stands on some of the
 land that they earnt money from.
