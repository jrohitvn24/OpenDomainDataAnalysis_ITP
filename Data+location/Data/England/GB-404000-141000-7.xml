		<title>07SHREWTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>      The old school building in       
 Shrewton was built and opened in 1869 
 using money subscribed by local people
 for the purpose.   A newspaper report 
 of the time describes how after the   
 official opening a tea party was held 
 in the main room where an Easter tree 
 had been placed.                      
      The school now occupies two sites
 either side of the High Street and    
 River Till.   The old 1869 building   
 still stands with some additions and  
 now houses two classes of children    
 aged 9 to 11 years of age.   A third  
 smaller classroom now houses the      
 school library.   The toilets are     
 separate from the school building and 
 are reached after crossing the        
 playground.  Behind the building is a 
 garden with a small pond and 14       
 species of tree.
