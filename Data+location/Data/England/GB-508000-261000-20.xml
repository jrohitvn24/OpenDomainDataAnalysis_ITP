		<title>20POPULATION IN L.STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> The{population}of Little Staughton has
 grown during the last decade.As train 
 and road services have improved so    
 people have found it possibe to live  
 in attractive surroundings whilst     
 working in London or other            
 conurbations.The present trend of     
 London firms to site some of          
 their offices in{Bedford and Milton   
{Keynes}is enabling many more people to
 live in North Bedfordshire villages   
 without spending a disproportionate   
 amount of time in travelling.The      
 population is fairly mobile with some 
 houses changing ownership every 4-5   
 years. In the Lower School, out of a  
 roll of 36 only 3 children are second 
 generation.                           
 The work on this block has been       
 completed by the Chairman of          
 Governors, Staff and Junior children  
 of{Kymbrook Lower School.             </content>
