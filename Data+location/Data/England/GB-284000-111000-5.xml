		<content> Land is Grade lll or 1V, Culm         
 Measures. In the area covered are 17  
 holdings, the two largest of 160 and  
 120 hectares farmed by tenants of the 
 Cruwys estate. The smallest, 2        
 hectares, a broiler unit, rears 700-  
 900 thousand birds per year. Owner-   
 occupiers farm the remainder of       
 between 6 and 104 hectares each.      
 The type of farming is similar        
 throughout, dairying and stockrearing.
 11 dairy herds, overall total 740 cows
 give about 5000 litres per cow per    
 year. Milking cows are often crossed  
 with beef bulls. Milk is sold to the  
 Milk Marketing Board who collect from 
 each unit daily. 10 flocks of sheep   
 make a ewe population of about 1600.  
 Store and fat cattle are reared and   
 some corn grown. The latter is mostly 
 barley for consumption by the farmer's
 own stock.                            </content>
