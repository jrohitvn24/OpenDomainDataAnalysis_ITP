		<title>14The Manor House, Everleigh</title>
		<content> A manor house has existed on this site
 since 1560. Prior to this in 1558 it  
 was Crown Land, under Queen Elizabeth 
 I.                                    
 The house was severly damaged by fire 
 in 1881 but was restored to its       
 present condition and was used as a   
 family residence until 1917. In 1920  
 it was purchased for use as a         
 convalescent home for young girls.    
 On the outbreak of World War II it was
 requisitioned as a military hospital  
 for both U.K. and U.S. troops.        
 Since 1942 it has been used by David  
 Bruce Laboratories, formerly called   
 the Emergency Vaccine Laboratory. In  
 1954 it was purchased by the War      
 Office, hence it reverts to the       
 "Crown" under Queen Elizabeth II.
