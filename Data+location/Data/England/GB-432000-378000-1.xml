 The area of Batemoor,on the southern  
 edge of the city of Sheffild,comprises
 many types of council housing as its  
 major landcover.They are all made from
 a mixture of brick,wood,tile and      
 concrete but vary in construction from
 six storey high rise flats to two     
 storey to town houses.There was only  
 one small row of private terraced     
 dwellings adjacent to the old A617    
 dual carriage way which runs through  
 this area.There is one shopping centre
 with only twelve small shops,but also 
 including a library,a health centre   
 and a public house.Amid the council   
 estate was one large old peoples home 
 and two schools.On the edge of the    
 housins area was an ambulance station 
 and a pumping station.Over the border 
 and into Derbyshire,the land was      
 entirely under grass for dairyfarming.</content>
