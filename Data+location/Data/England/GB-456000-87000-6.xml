		<content>  The cemetery at Upton belongs to     
 the Borough Council.It was founded in 
 1910.                                 
  There are 130 headstones made out    
 of marble,stone and granite.          
  The oldest stone we found belonged   
 to Mary Ann Diamond who died in 1911. 
  The newest grave belongs to Winifred 
 Sutton who died in 1982.She was       
 the grandmother of Steven Field in    
 our class.The headstone is made out of
 marble.                               
  Growing in the grass is a rare crop  
 of{orchids,}they are Common Spotted,  
 Early Purple and Green Winged.        
  These orchids grow naturally here but
 the grass is cut at times which will  
 allow them to flourish.
