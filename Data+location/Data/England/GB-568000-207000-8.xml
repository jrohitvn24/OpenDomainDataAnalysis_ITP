		<content>   The history of the school dates from
{1375}when Sir{John Mounteney}endowed a
 Grammar School.In{1551 King Edward VI 
 issued a warrant for the endowment of 
 a free{Grammar }School.The site of the
 school was at{Moulsham Friary,}but in 
{1633}the roof of the hall collapsed   
 due to decay.The governors purchased a
 site in{Duke Street}on which they     
 built a{new room}and a{Headmaster's   
{house.}By{1851}due to competition from
 other schools,the number of{pupils had
{fallen to 7}and in{1853}the{school    
{closed}for{3 years.}When it reopened  
 the numbers grew rapidly and a{new    
{school}was opened on the present site 
 in{Broomfield Road}in{1892.           
   In{1949}the school came under the   
 control of{Essex Education Authority  
 and in{1976 girls}were admitted for   
 the first time but were only allowed  
 in the{sixth form.                    </content>
