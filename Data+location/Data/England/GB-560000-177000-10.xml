		<title>10A SCHOOL DAY IN GRAYS</title>
		<content>  On Monday morning I wake up at 7.30  
 am. I get dressed and go down and have
 my breakfast. I have cereals and      
 toast. After, I have a wash and clean 
 my teeth then brush my hair. At 8.30 I
 leave for school and take my little   
 brother to school. I reach the school 
 gates about 8.45; the bell rings at   
 8.55. In class, Mr. Lyall, my teacher,
 calls the register. At 9.15 the bell  
 goes for Assembly. Mr. Newman reads us
 a story and we sing a song then we    
 have a prayer. Back in class we do    
 Maths until playtime at 10.30. We have
 15 minutes break. Dinner time is at   
 12.00. A dinner lady shows us to a    
 table and we eat our lunch. When we go
 out to play I play French Skipping. In
 the afternoon we have games or P.E. or
 Topic work. We go home at 3.15.
