		<title>13SHOPPING: Lepton/Almondbury</title>
		<content>   {Lepton}is a small village. We asked
 20 local people about their shopping  
 habits. We wanted to find out where   
 and how often they shopped.           
{Use of village shops:}                
    Daily 6 Weekly 10 Sometimes 5.     
{Huddersfield shops:}                  
    Daily 0 Weekly 16 Sometimes 4.     
{Other centres:}Regularly 1 Sometimes  
 17 Never 2. Of these,{Wakefield}(14)  
 and{Leeds}(7) were used by most people
    Half of the shoppers in{Almondbury}
 use local shops several times a week. 
 The supermarket and Post Office are   
 used most regularly, followed by the  
 grocer, greengrocer, butcher, baker   
 and chemist. The fish and chip shop is
 patronised by 50% of the sample, but  
 the DIY store is little used. Because 
 the survey was done in the early      
 afternoon, the people we interviewed  
 were mostly housewives or pensioners. </content>
