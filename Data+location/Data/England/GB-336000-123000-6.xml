		<content> Mr Woodrow who is nearly 70 years old 
 told us about some of the incidents   
 that happened when he was at school.  
 Once on his way to school he saw some 
 apples so he decided to go and 'pinch'
 some.  As he was doing this his       
 headmaster went past.  So when Mr     
 Woodrow got to school his headmaster  
 said,                                 
  "Woodrow, stand on my line."         
 He had the cane and afterwards he sat 
 on his hands in pain.                 
 Another time Mr Woodrow and his       
 friends were walking to school and    
 somebody went by on their bike and    
 greeted them ;but he and his friends  
 did not reply. Unfortunately his      
 headmaster came by and when they got  
 to school they had to walk around the 
 playground and every time they got to 
 their head they had to take off their 
 hats and say,"Hello," until 12.00.    </content>
