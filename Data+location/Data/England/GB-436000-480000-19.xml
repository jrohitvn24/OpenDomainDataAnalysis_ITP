		<content> WE HAVE FOUR PETS IN ALL.WE HAVE A    
 FISH AND THREE GUINEA PIGS.THE FISH IS
 CALLED 'FEARLESS FRED'.WE DID HAVE    
 THREE FISH,TWO FAN-TAILS AND A        
 GOLDFISH.THE GOLDFISH WAS THE ONLY ONE
 TO SURVIVE AND THAT'S WHY WE CALLED   
 HIM 'FEARLESS FRED'.HE MIGHT BE LONELY
 BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ALONE FOR A LONG  
 TIME NOW.WE CLEAN HIM OUT ONCE A WEEK.
 WE FEED FRED EVERY NIGHT WITH FLAKEY  
 PIECES OF FISH FOOD.                  
 OUR GUINEA PIGS ARE CALLED JEMMA,PETAL
 AND TOFFEEKINS.THEY ALL HAVE SOFT     
 SHINY FUR.ONCE TOFFEEKINS RAN AWAY.WE 
 TRY TO TAKE THE M OUT EVERY DAY AND   
 NIGHT.WE FEED THEM EACH NIGHT AND     
 CLEAN THEM OUT ONCE A WEEK AND GIVE   
 THEM CLEAN BEDDING.THEY SCRATCH A LOT 
 AND THEY AREN'T VERY EASY TO CATCH    
 EITHER.
