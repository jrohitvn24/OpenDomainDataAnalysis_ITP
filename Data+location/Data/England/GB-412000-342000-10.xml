		<title>10Problems with the Church</title>
		<content>During the last summer of 1985 dry rot 
was discovered in the Lady Chapel      
ceiling and also behind the organ and  
work is in hand to execute the         
necessary cure.                        
  Money is always a problem but        
parishioners support church fundraising
extremely well, the main fundraising   
being the Anual Autumn Fair.  The last 
one realised in excess of 900 pounds,  
which for a parish of about 300        
inhabitants is quite good.             
  The Church features in many church   
hisorical books as being of great      
interest and sees more visitors during 
a week than many other village         
churches.  The tombs of the Fitzherbert
family are now in the chancel.  Lord   
Stafford is the current head of the    
family and they have recently          
undertaken the repair and cleaning of  
the tombs.                             </content>
