		<title>13OUR LOCAL M.P.</title>
		<content>     Humphrey Malins, elected June 1983
General Election.   Surgeries held     
locally 1st and 3rd Fridays.           
An Average Day:                        
     He starts his day by opening his  
mail - he usually receives about 100   
letters a day.  Most of the letters are
written to him about problems in our   
area such as housing difficulties, un- 
even pavements, crime and transport.   
Some of the letters he passes on to    
other M.P.'s who may be able to help.  
     Mr. Malins goes to the House of   
Commons at 2.30pm. He may take part in 
debates or he may see constituents     
about their problems. The House usually
sits till 10 pm with voting starting   
about 7 pm. Sometimes debates can cont-
inue until 7 am. On Fridays they sit in
the morning which gives Mr. Malins an  
afternoon to spend in the constituency.
He spends Sundays with his family.     </content>
