		<title>04WOODLAND IN BIBURY AREA</title>
		<content> Roughly one square kilometre of       
 woodland in the Bibury area consists  
 mainly of beech, other hardwoods and  
 some softwoods. More fruit bearing    
 trees have been planted for the       
 wildlife and in the future three small
 woods are to be planted for game      
 coverts. Spot thinning takes place in 
 established woods to let the sun in to
 encourage wildlife. The hardwoods are 
 sold for furniture making, the smaller
 timber for pit props and the very     
 small for firewood. The softwood      
 timber is used on the farm for        
 fencing. First year seedlings up to   
 whips are planted and great care must 
 be taken to protect the young trees   
 from rabbit and squirrel damage.      
 Quite a few trees are lost through    
 disease. In 1976 a lot of beech were  
 lost through drought.
