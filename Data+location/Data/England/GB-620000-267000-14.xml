		<content>Q1How do you find spreading your work  
over several parishes?                 
A1 Interesting.                        
Q2How are lay people involved in the   
organisation of your churches?         
A2To compensate for the shortage of    
clergymen,lay involvement in church    
affairs is increasing.The running of   
the church demands the services of the 
Church Council,the treasurer,organist, 
church warden,the bell ringers etc.    
Q3If 1 of your churches disappeared &amp;  
you could replace it,what lines would  
you follow?                            
A3This would be a matter for the people
of hte parish to decide.The building is
not the property of the parson. the    
Church Council would make the decision.
They may decide not to replace or they 
may provide a smaller building more    
suited to present congregations.
