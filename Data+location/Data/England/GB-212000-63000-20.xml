		<title>20Filming Near Braddock</title>
		<content> In 1982 the pretty little church in   
 Braddock,near West Taphouse was used  
 in the filming of{"My Cousin Rachel." 
 It is a story by Daphne Du Maurier and
 was serialised by the B.B.C.          
 Many of the local community and some  
 children from Braddock School were    
 used as{"extras."}They were paid      
 Â£30.00 daily.Children were paid Â£15.00
 daily.They had to be ready for action 
 by 8:00a.m.                           
 The Bellringers from Braddock church  
 were used in the filming and great    
 excitment was felt by all when we     
 watched the filmed results on TV.     
 Many of the film crew lodged at local 
 Bed &amp; Breakfast establishments.       
 Only two years previously,Boconnoc    
 House had featured in the filming of  
{ "Poldark"}Series so the community    
 were not totally new to the film      
 business!     By Upper Juniors        </content>
