		<title>01SUMMARY OF ST.HELENS AREA</title>
		<content>    Our block covers an area of St.    
 Helens that is on the outskirts of the
 town.  A major coverage of the land is
 farmland, with 8 squares of our       
 block having farming as the Primary   
 Land cover.                           
    One district of our block is       
 called{Clock Face. }In Clock Face     
 there are many houses. Many years     
 ago Clock Face was mainly fields and  
 farms but now houses have been built. 
 At one time the railway used to run a 
 passenger service from St. Helens to  
 Widnes but now it is used by coal     
 trains from Sutton Manor Colliery.    
 St. Helens is an industrial town but  
 in our block there is only half of one
 square that has industries in it.  The
 main industry in our block was mining 
 but the Clock Face Colliery is now    
 closed. {Sutton}is another district in
 our block.                            </content>
