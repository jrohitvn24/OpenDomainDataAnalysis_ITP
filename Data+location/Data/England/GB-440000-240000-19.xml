		<title>19Work and leisure at Wroxton.</title>
		<content>The students who attend the College    
come in two age groups. There are the  
undergraduates who are, usually, aged  
from 20 to 24 and post-graduates who   
are from 22 to 70 plus. The students   
have on average a two hour lecture each
week with two hour seminars every other
week. Once a fortnight groups of two   
or three students have tutorials. They 
are expected to write papers and       
produce tutorial reports every two     
weeks. If they use their time wisely   
they should have 4 to 6 hours a day for
leisure activities. Whilst they are in 
England they are taken to places of    
interest such as London, York,         
Scotland, and as part of their course  
they also visit the theatre at         
Stratford-upon-Avon etc. The students  
also have a 10 day travel recess when  
they are able to visit the Continent.
