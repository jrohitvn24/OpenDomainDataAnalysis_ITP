		<title>08TRAVEL TO &amp; FROM BEMPTON</title>
		<content>      We are fortunate in having as    
 part of our transport network, a {    
{British Rail}station on the southern  
 outskirts of the village. This gives a
 direct link with {Bridlington}to the  
 south and {Scarborough}to the north.  
      Of concern to residents in       
 general and to the {Parish Council}in 
 particular is an unmanned automatic   
 open level crossing at Buckton. This  
 type of crossing has no               
 barriers.Already there has been one { 
{crash}involving a tracor and a train  
 which resulted in a derailment.       
 Fortunately there were no severe      
 injuries.                             
      The roads in the area have to    
 deal with considerably increased      
 numbers of vehicles during the holiday
 season. Many of the roads are narrow  
 and often have vehicles parked on them
 leading to obvious difficulties.      </content>
