 Our village does not have any special 
 custom such as rush bearing like in   
 some places,but many people take part 
 in village galas.Our village does not 
 have a gala,but there is one in       
 Ulverston and we join in that.        
  Lots of girls go to the dancing      
 troupes in the winter and in the      
 summer they go to all the galas in the
 other places.They wear all sorts of   
 costumes, a different one each year,  
 and dance different dances. I have    
 been a clown, a majorette, a milkmaid 
 and a ballerina.                      
  Our dancing troupe has been to galas 
 in Ulverston, Grange-over-Sands, Askam
 and Dalton. My mum makes a lot of the 
 costumes because she is good at       
 sewing. I am allowed to help her now  
 because she says I am big enough to   
 start using the sewing machine.       </content>
