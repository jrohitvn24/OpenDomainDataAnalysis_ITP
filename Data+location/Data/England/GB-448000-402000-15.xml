 finding out how much and what type of 
 traffic passed through Barnburgh      
 between 9 a.m. and 12 noon, and

   Our results were as follows :       
                                       
 Cars - 460  Vans - 60  Lorries - 40   
                                       
 Buses - 20  Motor-Cycles - 16         
                                       
 Bicycles - 8  Farm Tractors - 3       
                                       
   The total number of vehicles that   
 passed our checkpoint in 5 hours was  
 607.
