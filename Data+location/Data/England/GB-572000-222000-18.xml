		<title>18Fetes and Sales in Braintree</title>
		<content>    During the year there are many     
 fetes, bazaars, rummage and jumble    
 sales held in and around the Braintree
 area. These are mainly used as fund   
 raising events for local charities,   
 schools and other small organisations.
    Every Saturday morning the         
 Methodist Chapel, on the corner of    
 Sandpit Lane and Rayne Road, holds a  
 coffee morning where customers of the 
 local shops may drop in for a drink   
 and a moment or two of friendship.    
 Other local churches also hold these  
 informal gatherings.                  
    Much of the information publicising
 these local events may either be found
 in either the Yellow Advertiser or the
 Braintree and Witham Times. A further 
 source of information may be located  
 on the billboards and hoardings       
 positioned in the centre of town.
