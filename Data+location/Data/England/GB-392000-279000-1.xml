		<title>01CLENT TO ROMSLEY</title>
		<content> The area we studied was very          
 agricultural. It contains one high set
 of hills in the west, 'The Clents',   
 and only two places of any size. These
 are called Clent and Romsley. Clent is
 very small and is near the hills.     
 There are pubs and shops for tourists.
 Romsley is bigger and is in the east  
 of our area. People here are mostly   
 commuters. In between the two places  
 is mostly farmland. We didn't see many
 people out working in the fields even 
 though it was summer.
