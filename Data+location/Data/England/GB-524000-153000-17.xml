		<title>17Religion in Kingswood area</title>
		<content>     There are two{Church of England   
 Churches in the area. St.Andrew's,    
 Kingswood; and The Church of the      
 Wisdom of God, Lower Kingswood. Both  
 are looked after by one{vicar}who     
 lives in the Kingswood Warren housing 
 estate. He is responsible for the     
 pastoral care of people living in the 
 majority of our area. Attendance at   
{Sunday services}is quite good for the 
 population of the area, especially in 
 wealthy Kingswood - where three       
 services are held each Sunday. Church 
 life is quite healthy with many       
 Church-based groupes meeting          
 regularly. These include Mother's     
 Union, St. Andrew's Prayer Group,     
 Cubs, Scouts, Brownies, and Guides.   
     The area also comes under the     
{Roman Catholic parish}of Tadworth and 
 there is a{Free Church chapel}in Lower
 Kingswood.                            </content>
