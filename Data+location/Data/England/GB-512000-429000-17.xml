		<title>17HUMBER GUARDIAN, HULL DOCK</title>
		<content> The{Humber Guardian}is a small vessel 
 that is based in King George Dock in  
 Hull. It is responsible for the       
 maintenance of all the lightships and 
 buoys in the Humber Estuary.          
 The lightships and buoys are used by  
 the captains and pilots to help them  
 steer a safe course through the       
 navigable channels and thereby avoid  
 the dangerous sandbanks.              
 Each of the several hundred buoys is  
 battery operated and is equipped with 
 two spare bulbs that come on          
 automatically should the first fail.  
 Nonetheless, each buoy has to be      
 serviced every nine months so the crew
 is kept busy.                         
 The{Humber Guardian}is equipped with  
 advanced sonar, radar and computer    
 systems so that the captain knows     
 exactly where he is whatever the      
 conditions.                           </content>
