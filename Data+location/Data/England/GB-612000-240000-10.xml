		<title>10Electrification, East Region</title>
		<content>Some years ago British Rail decided    
to electrify the track from Colchester 
to Norwich and Harwich.                
They had to change the lines because   
they curved too much for fast trains   
and come off the tracks. They had to   
heighten the bridges so the electric   
wires would fit under for the electric 
trains.  The semaphore signals were    
changed for colour light signalling    
when the electric trains started to go.
British Rail dug holes and poured      
cement in them to support the posts    
which were put up for the wires.       
Ipswich Station has been painted and   
improved and new timetable indicators  
which look like televisions have been  
put up give you up to minute inform-   
ation about trains.                    
On May 13th electric trains started to 
go from London to Ipswich.
