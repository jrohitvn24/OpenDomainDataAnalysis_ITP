		<content> As Thorner is a relatively small      
 village, the leisure opportunities are
 limited. There are tennis courts, a   
 football pitch, allotments, a         
 playground, riding stables, a cricket 
 pitch, bowls and even a golf course   
 closeby at Scarcroft. There is a      
 Ladies Hockey club too.               
                                       
 Within the village itself the church  
 tends to be the main focus.           
                                       
 There are several organizations       
 specialising in local interest such as
 the Historical Society and the Village
 Society.                              
                                       
 For those interested in music there   
 are the church bell ringers, the      
 Festival Chorus and junior choir as   
 well as hand bell ringers.
