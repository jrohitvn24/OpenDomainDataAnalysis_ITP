		<title>03Moravian Settlement Manch'r</title>
		<content>   At Manchester's Moravian Settlement 
 we found that they still keep up old  
 traditions after 200 years.The        
 Moravians got their name from the two 
 countries they came from, Bohemia and 
 Moravia, now in Czechoslovakia.The    
 settlement's oldest building is the   
 church and people still think it is   
 the most important.There are 150      
 dwellings in the square.Nobody knows  
 when the traditional costume went out 
 of fashion because the Moravians did  
 not think that it was important to    
 write it down.During the war people   
 used to take it in turns, including   
 women, to stand in the church clock   
 tower and watch for fires.At the      
 moment the square is being renovated. 
 It is estimated that it will cost a   
 quarter of a million pounds.1985 is   
 the bi-centenary.They are having lots 
 of celebratons.                       </content>
