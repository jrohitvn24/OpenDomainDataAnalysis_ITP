 WEST TANFIELD ALONG THE RIPON ROAD,ON 
 THE BANKS OF THE RIVER URE. IN A SMALL
 BUILDING JOINING THE MILL IS AN OLD   
 RUSTY UNDERSHOT WATERMILL WHICH HAS   
 NOT WORKED SINCE 1950 AND HAS FALLEN  
 INTO DISREPAIR.NEARBY ARE THE SLUICE  
 GATES WHICH ARE BROKEN AND THE MILL   
 RACE IS FULL OF MUD AND WOULD NEED    
 DREDGING IF THE MILL WAS TO WORK      
 AGAIN.                                
  INSIDE THE DUSTY MILL,ONE CAN SEE    
 PIECES OF MACHINERY WHICH WERE USED   
 WHEN THE MILL WAS OPERATING.THERE ARE 
 THE LARGE GRINDING STONES WHICH WERE  
 POWERED BY THE WATER WHEEL.THERE ARE  
 SHOOTS FOR DELIVERING THE CORN (WHEAT,
 BARLEY,OATS).ABOVE THE GRINDING STONES
 ARE THE APPLE TOOTHED COGS AND THE    
 SACK HOIST,WHICH TOOK THE BAGS OF CORN
 TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING.THE MILL   
 ITSELF HAS 3 FLOORS.                  </content>
