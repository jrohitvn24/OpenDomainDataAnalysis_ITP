		<content>{SHOPS.}A small modern purpose built   
 Super market is on the A443, on the   
 Common.Many homes now use this shop   
 for both their daily and weekly       
 shopping.This mini super market is    
 also most popular with neighbouring   
 villages prefering to shop here rather
 than journeying to the towns.A small  
 village store is in the old village.  
 This shop also delivers daily         
 newspapers and bread to homes in quite
 a wide radius of Abberley.            
{DAIRY.}The Beehive Dairy (local) and  
 the Co-opative stores (Kidderminster) 
 deliver milk daily in the area.       
{Garages.}A general repair garage      
 (including agriculture) is on the     
 Common. This includes the sales of    
 petrol,diesel and paraffin.It is also 
 a M.O.T.testing station.              
 A much smaller car repair garage is in
 the village square in the old Smithy. </content>
