 built in 1973 and was finished in     
 1974.It was opened to the public on   
 August 1st 1974.It was designed by    
 Ramsey Combes and Cooper and built by 
 Bishop Pools from Berkshire.There are 
 12 people working there and 9 are     
 trained lifeguards.They have a life   
 saving club,subaqua club and swimming 
 clubs.Schools often use the swimming  
 pool for lessons.There are over 50,000
 people who use the swimming pool a    
 year.They can't build any new         
 facilities because they haven't enough
 room.Squash used to be more popular   
 than swimming but now the opposite is 
 true.
