		<title>05The Royal Grammar School (C)</title>
		<content>The Royal Grammar School was endowed by
John Gardyner in 1472,but it is known  
from legal documents to have been in   
existence before then.The original site
of the school was close to the Priory  
Church near the centre of the city. As 
the school increased in size and began 
to take in borders,new buildings were  
erected in 1852 on East Road.Today the 
school occupies a large area below the 
Ashton Memorial. There are about 850   
boys on roll including nearly 200      
borders.There are over 240 boys in the 
6th form. Each year about 90 day-boys  
and 30 boarders are admitted in the 11+
age group.Places for day-boys are      
awarded on the basis of performance in 
a selection test. A few additional     
boarding places are allocated on the   
results of the Common Entrance exam    
at 13+.Some boys enter the school on   
the basis of 'O'Level results.         </content>
