		<title>10The People of Bridgerule</title>
		<content> The people of Bridgerule lead a       
 relatively quiet and peaceful life    
 enjoying the friendship and company of
 each other.                           
  Most families own a car and are able 
 to enjoy a day out to the cities of   
 Exeter and Plymouth which are both    
 approximately an hour's drive away.   
 For those who do not own a car there  
 is a regular daily bus service to Bude
 and Holsworthy.                       
  The villagers have several sporting  
 teams including badminton, skittles   
 (men and women), football and cricket.
 There is a local clay pigeon shoot and
 many locals are keen anglers. There is
 also a thriving WI, a youth club and  
 an amateur theatrical society. The    
 local schoolchildren also provide     
 entertainment regularly throughout the
 year.                                 
                                       </content>
