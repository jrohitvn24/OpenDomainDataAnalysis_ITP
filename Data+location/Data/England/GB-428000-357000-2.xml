		<content> The housing in this area is mixed.    
 Most of the older houses being built  
 of local gritstone. In Matlock Bath   
 all the houses are on the western side
 of the gorge. In Starkholmes the      
 houses face west. There are isolated  
 pockets of modern development, the    
 only fairly large group of houses     
 being on Tor Rise off Starkholmes     
 Road. Because of the steep slopes     
 houses have been built following the  
 main roads. Matlock Town is the       
 original centre of Matlock and lies in
 the area surrounding St. Gile's       
 Church.
