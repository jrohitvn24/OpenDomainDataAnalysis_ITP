		<title>06Family Sunday in Ponteland</title>
		<content>{Sunday }is usually a quieter day when 
 many families stay at home and relax. 
 A Sunday newspaper is much thicker    
 than a daily paper and the man of the 
 house enjoys having time to read it.  
 In some families one or two members   
 will go to church.In many homes each  
 person gets their own breakfast when  
 they get up.Dinner is a hot meal which
 is cooked by the mother of the family.
 She may be helped by her children.    
 There may be a joint of meat roasted  
 in the gas or electric oven,served    
 with vegetables cooked in a pan in    
 boiling,salted water.These may be     
 peas,carrots,cauliflower or cabbage.  
{Pets }are kept by many families.They  
 are tame animals kept  for the        
 pleasure of the owners.Dogs are the   
 most popular pet,the second being cats
 followed by budgerigars kept in a cage
 Goldfish are kept in water with gravel</content>
