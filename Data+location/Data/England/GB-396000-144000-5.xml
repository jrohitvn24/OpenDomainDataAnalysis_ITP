		<title>05RELIGION IN CHITTERNE</title>
		<content> Church of England: The Foundation     
 Stone for the Church of All Saint's   
 was laid in 1861 and the Church was   
 consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury
 on 4th November, 1862.  A Family      
 Service is held once a month, and     
 Communion is celebrated on all other  
 Sundays.  In any month when there is a
 fifth Sunday, there is Evensong.   The
 Priest-in-Charge holds Services in    
 Chitterne, Orcheston and Tilshead, and
 lives in the Vicarage in Tilshead.    
 This is only a small Living.  The     
 right is still retained by Deed to    
 have four Churchwardens, two for each 
 of the Parishes of Chitterne. There   
 was a Church for both parishes until  
 the 19th century, when All Saint's was
 built to replace the two.             
 Baptists: They hold an informal       
 Service once a month, while people of 
 other faiths travel to nearby towns.  </content>
