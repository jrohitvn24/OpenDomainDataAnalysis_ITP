		<title>17Development of Oakley</title>
		<content> Oakley's oldest building is St. Mary's
 Church.   This, and older farmhouses, 
 cottages and barns are built of       
 limestone (oolitic) with tile or      
 thatch roofs.   In time, the village  
 has moved away from the church and    
 river.   Growth was slow.   The most  
 notable C19 buildings were erected by 
 the Duke of Bedford.   Inter-war      
 development was slow with land        
 bounded by High Street, Church Lane,  
 Lovell and Station Roads remaining    
 largely farmland.   Field names remain
 in the street names of the new estates
 - Dewlands, Ruffs Furze, Lincroft -   
 which consist of C2O styles and       
 materials - brick and tile, with much 
 glass and white woodwork (or plastic) 
 in evidence - which have little in    
 common with traditional materials of  
 North Bedfordshire.
