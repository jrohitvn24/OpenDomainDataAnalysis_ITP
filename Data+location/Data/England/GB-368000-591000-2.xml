		<title>02The Roe Deer of Kielder</title>
		<content> Roe deer are now plentiful in the     
 Kielder Forests, with their numbers   
 having increased dramatically since   
 planting first started in 1926. Up to 
 5000 now roam the forest.             
  The deer prefer the younger parts    
 of the forest, which provide them with
 shelter as well as food and cover, but
 they are found in older sections too. 
   It is possible to observe roe deer  
 early in the morning, as they move    
 back into cover, and in quiet areas   
 they may also be seen during the day. 
 The best time of year for such        
 observations is May and June, when    
 kids are born and adults shed their   
 winter coat and replace it with       
 brighter red summer colours.          
 Culling is carried out by forest      
 rangers, to prevent over-population   
 and possible starvation.
