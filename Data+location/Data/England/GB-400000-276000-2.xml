		<content>The austin-rover site at longbridge    
cover 260 acres. It was orginally      
started by Herbert Austin in 1905 in a 
derelict printing works 7 miles out    
-side birmingham. Part of the land was 
disused railway cuttings, part of the  
land was rented form birmingham        
corporation. The site itself wasn't    
really ideal for manufacture because   
of all the hills that it incorporates  
and a lot of expence and effort had    
to be put into transporting the various
components about the factory. The      
range of cars include the mini which   
has been produced for 26 years, the    
rover for 2 years and the metro for    
5 years. The total employees in 1985   
was 11.5 thousand compared with 22,000 
in 1974. The factory is in the main    
assembly line. Most of it is automated 
and computerised but workers still     
finish the product off.                </content>
