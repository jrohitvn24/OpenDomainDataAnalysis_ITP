		<title>12A FIREMAN'S DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
   At 9.00 fireman Cox checks the fire 
 engines and all of the equipment. At  
 9.30 he practises on the tower or at a
 factory or shop until 11.30. He checks
 all the equipment again until 1.00.   
   Sometimes firemen get parties of    
 schoolchildren and adults to talk     
 about fire safety.                    
   When they check the equipment they  
 make sure that the watertanker is     
  full.                                
   All of the firemen have bleepers so 
 that the station can contact them.    
   In the afternoon the firemen clean  
 the engines lights and make sure that 
 the siren is working.                 
   Some days the fireman has no calls  
 at all,some days he can have about 4  
 calls or more.                        
   The firemen get called out for fires
 and floods and to save animals.       </content>
