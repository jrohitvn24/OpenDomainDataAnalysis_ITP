		<content> An Interview with Miss Smith          
 Continued.                            
 In 1939 many children were evacuated  
 from the cities to East Winch and they
 came to the village school.There was  
 no piped water at this time and if    
 anyone wanted a drink he had to get   
 one from a bucket. The school was lit 
 with oil lamps until 1947 when        
 electricity was brought to the        
 village. the children sat six to a    
 desk and sat on benches or forms.     
 During Miss Smith's early days as     
 headteacher there were between thirty 
 and forty children at the school.     
 There was no telephone, no school     
 meals or milk .                       
 Many of the children lived a long way 
 from school. If they lived more than  
 three miles away they would be        
 provided with transport.
