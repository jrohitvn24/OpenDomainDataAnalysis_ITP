		<title>05SITTINGBOURNE'S EDUCATION</title>
		<content> Sittingbourne has a very unique       
 Education system.At the age of 13 you 
 either change to go to a Grammar or   
 you stay at a Comprehensive.The order 
 of schools is Infant 5-7,Junior 7-11, 
 Secondary 11-17,or Grammar 13-17.After
 that there are colleges or            
 universities in other towns.Before    
 school there are pre-school play      
 groups.This helps give mothers a break
 from over-exited children.The Grammar 
 schools are called Borden and         
 Highsted,Borden for boys and Highsted 
 for girls.The top 25% go to these     
 schools.There are 4 Comprehensives in 
 Sittingbourne,Rowena for girls,       
 St.Johns for boys,and Fulston Manor   
 and Westlands which are mixed.There is
 also a private school called the      
 Convent which is run by Nuns and is   
 for girls only.This system is         
 complicated.                          </content>
