		<content> I get up at 10 or 20 past 8 most      
 mornings.I hurry into the bathroom and
 get washed and brush my teeth.After   
 that I hurry and get dressed and go   
 downstairs for my breakfast.Usually my
 mam and brother are having their      
 breakfast so mine is ready as well.   
 After breakfast I comb my hair and put
 my shoes and my coat on then go down  
 to school.I walk to school with my    
 brother.When I get into the school    
 yard I usually play football.After the
 bell goes I get into my class line    
 then wait for the teacher to send us  
 into school.In class we do maths first
 then after play we do English.Then I  
 go home for my dinner.I come back to  
 school at about 12.50.I play football,
 then when the bell goes I go back into
 school for the afternoon session.After
 that I go home,have my tea, play till 
 8.30 then go to bed and read.         </content>
