 library,while nurses run ante-natal   
 and post-natal clinics. The           
 physiotherapist and speech therapist  
 are part time. The mid-wife does home 
 visits as well as her work at the     
 centre.the school nurse spends a lot  
 of time in the pharmacy which sells   
 medecines. 250 people use the centre  
 every day including the workers.Latest
