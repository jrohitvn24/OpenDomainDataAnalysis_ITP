		<title>07A TEACHER'S DAY</title>
		<content>                                       
  The children interviewed one of the  
teachers, Mr.B., about a typical day.  
This is what he said:                  
  I get up at about 7 o'clock, along   
with the rest of my family. Breakfast  
is usually cereals and toast. I live   
about 25 miles from school in Stafford 
and so I have to leave home by 8.00am  
to drive to school in my car. I arrive 
at school by 8.40 so that I can be     
ready for when children arrive at 8.50.
Lessons begin at 9.00 and basic work   
like Maths and English take up most of 
the morning, with PE or a TV programme 
as well. I often have my dinner with   
the children. I like chatting to them. 
Afternoons are taken up with projects, 
art and craft,etc. When the children go
home at 3.30, I often spend some time  
in school preparing for the next day,  
then do 2 or 3 hours more at home.     </content>
