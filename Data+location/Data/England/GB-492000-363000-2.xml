      CHANGING TIMES. THE 1930's.      
        Mr. Clarke Remembers.          
  Mr Clarke started school around 1923.
 He went to the old village school.In  
 the school they had at least 144      
 pupils.They sat at big long desks with
 four to five children.They used slates
 to write with instead of paper.Only   
 the top class used pen and inK.They   
 stayed at the junior school until they
 were 14years old.If you got a         
 scholarship you could go to the       
 grammer school or if your parents     
 could afford it they could pay to     
 go.You had to be quite clever to earn 
 a scholarship.                        
   In the 1930's there were many       
 trademan like                         
 blacksmith,butchers,bakers,tailors,whe
 elwrights,cartright,coffinmaker,
