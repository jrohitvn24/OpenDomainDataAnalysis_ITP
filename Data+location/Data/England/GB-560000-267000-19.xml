		<title>19Leisure: Landwade Area</title>
		<content> People spend between 10 and 20 hours a
 week on leisure activities. Most of   
 this time is home based spent         
 gardening, decorating, entertaining   
 friends and watching television,      
 almost always within the family or    
 with one or two others.               
 Some people are involved in local     
 village activities - often Church     
 based, or they travel to Cambridge (15
 miles) and Bury St. Edmunds (12 miles)
 to use the facilities there: shops,   
 cinema, theatre, sports centre and    
 restaurants. They travel by car as    
 there are few public transport sevices
 in the evenings. Newmarket (3 miles)  
 provides a library, a swimming pool,  
 some shops and{"The Cabaret Club"}with
 regular shows and dances as well as   
 "Bingo" sessions.
