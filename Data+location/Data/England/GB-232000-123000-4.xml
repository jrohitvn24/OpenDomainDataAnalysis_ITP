		<content> The land is covered with              
 farmland,woodland,grassland and scrub.
 Almost the entire length of the cliffs
 is woodland.In the south-west corner  
 of the block there is a water tower,it
 is south of the A39.Built in 1952 it  
 has a capacity of 172,000 gallons,but 
 it is no longer a service reservoir   
 and has been by-passed.It suffered    
 from leakage.A new service reservoir  
 built in the Hobby Drive,caters for   
 the needs of Clovelly village.London  
 Lodge,on the opposite side of the A39 
 from the water tower,was probably an  
 old hunting lodge.It was refurbished  
 in 1911.A private approach path runs  
 through the archway into woodland     
 northwards to the Hobby Drive.The     
 nearby farm Burnstone, takes in       
 Eastacott which was once seperate.
