		<title>19AMNESTY, CRANBROOK GROUP</title>
		<content>   Sharon, Hartley, is the home of the 
 Chairman of the Cranbrook and District
 Group of Amnesty International, which 
 includes members from Hawkhurst,      
 Sandhurst, Tenterden and Biddenden.   
   We work for the release of prisoners
 of conscience, gaoled for their       
 politics, religion or race though they
 have used no violence.  We continue to
 write to Libyan authorities about such
 a prisoner, long overdue for release. 
   In actions addressed to particular  
 countries we protest against detention
 without trial, and torture and murder 
 by security forces, and we seek       
 abolition of the death penalty world- 
 wide.  Friends of the Group telegraph 
 governments, appealing for those in   
 imminent danger of torture or death.  
   From the peace of Kent we reach out 
 to people oppressed and suffering in  
 many parts of the world.              </content>
