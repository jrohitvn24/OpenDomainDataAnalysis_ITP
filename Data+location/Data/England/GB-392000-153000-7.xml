		<content> Mr. Sid Corp                          
 MR.Corp owns his farm of 300 acres    
 jointly with brother Arthur.          
 He intends to keep the farm in the    
 family and employs his sons to work   
 for him.                              
 The farm is  situated either side of  
 the B3098 being a mixture of flat and 
 sloped ground, the steepest slopes    
 being covered in deciduous trees.The  
 majority of the land is used for      
 pasture for 104 Beef cattle,70 milk   
 cows, 30 calves, 2 bulls, 120 pigs,70 
 sheep, 4 horses and 2 goats,although  
 63 acres are ploughed for corn,and 7  
 acres for root crops,the latter being 
 used mainly for cattle feed during the
 winter.Modern equipment is now used   
 for all work.Most farms in the area   
 are similar to Mr.Corp's,in land use  
 and family tradition.
