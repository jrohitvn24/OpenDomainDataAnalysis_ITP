		<content> Within the Trull and Staplehay area,  
 there are 8{regular bus services}to   
 the main county town _ Taunton _ a    
 day,from Monday to Friday.This takes a
 quarter of an hour, but people are    
 still{dissatisfied}with the service.  
  Many people use{private transport},  
 owning on average two cars per family.
 The lanes around the area tend to be  
 narrow and winding, with high hedges  
 and few passing points. There are few 
 pedestrian paths, making it{unsafe}for
 walkers, especially for parents with  
 young children.Serious accidents have 
 occurred,and heavy traffic has made   
 parents  living by the road especially
 wary; one household  with young       
 children have had to place  a large   
 gate on their premises for safety     
 reasons.{
