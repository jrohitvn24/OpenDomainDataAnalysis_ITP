TIMOTHY'S MORNING.                     
                                       
 I am Timothy,aged 8.I get up at       
half-past 7.I get dressed,then I have  
my breakfast,usually Rice Crispies.    
 My mummy gets my packed lunch ready,  
 and puts it in my schoolbag.Then we   
 walk to school if it is not raining.If
 it is we go in the car.When I get     
 there I take my coat off and hang it  
 up with my bag.Then I go to my        
 classroom.                            
 My teacher calls the register.Most    
children have a packed lunch.We work   
until 10:30 when we have playtime,then 
come in for more lessons at 10:45.At 12
noon it is dinner-time.The school      
dinners go in first,then the packed    
lunch children come in when the dinners
go out to play.That is my morning.     
                                       </content>
