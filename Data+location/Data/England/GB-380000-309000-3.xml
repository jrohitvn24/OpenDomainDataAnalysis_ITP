		<content> The Watling Street, or A5 as it is now
 known, runs in an almost straight line
 across our area.  The original road   
 was built by the Romans and ran from  
 London to Holyhead in Anglesey.  The  
 road was improved by Thomas Telford in
 the early nineteenth century and      
 became a toll road.                   
 The Old Coach Road in Bishops Wood    
 joined the A5 and brought horse drawn 
 coaches from London, via Wolverhampton
 on to Chester and North Wales.  Until 
 recently the road was very busy       
 making life difficult for local people
 and businesses.  The opening of the   
 nearby M54, from Wolverhampton to     
 Telford has taken much of the heavy   
 traffic away.
