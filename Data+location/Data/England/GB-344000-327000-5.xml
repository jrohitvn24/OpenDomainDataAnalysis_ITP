		<content> There are many social activities, some
 of them of a{sporting}nature,         
 supported by the local villagers and  
 the farming community. There is the   
{Loppington Shooting Sydicate,}which   
 meets each week during the season,    
 from 1st September to 1st February.   
 They shoot pheasant, partridge, and   
 wild duck.  A local farm breeds       
 pheasants and partridges for the      
 shoot. The{North Shropshire Hunt      
 visits Loppington two or three times a
 year for fox hunting and some local   
 people take part. Loppington also has 
 a{Football Club}which actively        
 competes in the local league matches  
 during the football season.
