 The main transport nowadays is the    
 car.The A27 is a very{busy}road,there 
 are nearly always{traffic jams}caused 
 by the{roadworks}so this means many   
{long delays}and people are always     
 frustrated at not getting to work on  
 time.People have wanted a{by-pass}    
 since 1939,and the government have at 
 last agreed to build it.Work has      
 just started.The by-pass will{link    
{Chichester to Havant}in one           
 section.The by-pass will take the     
 traffic around Fishbourne instead of  
 through the middle of the village.The 
 by-pass is going under Salthill       
 Road,and fly overs will be going over 
 the railway.You will no longer be able
 to drive along Fishbourne Road to     
 Chichester.We hope this will make the 
 village a lot{quieter}and a more      
{peaceful}place to live in.            </content>
