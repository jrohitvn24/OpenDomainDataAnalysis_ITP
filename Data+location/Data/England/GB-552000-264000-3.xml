 A notable feature of the landscape is 
 the giant 132 Kv pylon power grid     
 which marches across from the NE      
 corner to the SW. All occupied        
 buildings have mains electricity,     
 but only some have mains water.

 Three minor roads serve the area, and 
 these are now shared by farm and non  
 farm traffic, the latter drawn by the 
 attractions of the river Cam. Most    
 houses are on the phone, having been  
 connected to the nearby village by    
 underground cable. Citizens band radio
 is used by some farmers. Postal       
 services come from Lode and Swaffham  
 Prior. The Lodes are now barely       
 navigable.                            </content>
