		<title>14A typical Saturday</title>
		<content> On Saturday my mum sometimes has to   
 work.She is a midwife and has to go   
 around houses to ladies who have just 
 had babies.She shows them how to wash 
 the baby and she checks the baby and  
 makes sure the mother is alright.     
   My dad usually does some gardening  
 until about lunch time and then he    
 goes to the pub for a couple of drinks
 and comes back and sleeps.            
   My brother usually goes train       
 spotting.This is where you go to a    
 station or on trains and take the     
 numbers of the trains down.           
   I usually get up about 9.00am and go
 to Dunstable or swimming with my      
 friends.When we come back I sometimes 
 go to the library.Then I have some    
 lunch, read for a bit and ring someone
 up for a chat.Later on I watch T.V or 
 go out with my friends.Then I go in   
 and have my dinner and watch T.V.     </content>
