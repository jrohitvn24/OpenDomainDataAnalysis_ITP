		<title>07FARMING CUCKFIELD RURAL</title>
		<content> The farms in this area vary in size,  
 crops and stock.Great Bently has the  
 best arable land growing wheat and    
 barley.This year peas for freezing    
 were grown to contract.Despite an     
 unusually wet summer,they were har-   
 vested successfully,but will not be   
 grown again,due to marketing problems.
 Field beans were grown on Tyes farm   
 (worked with Biggs farm)they are con- 
 tracted,sown one autumn and harvested 
 by the contractors the next.They are  
 then milled into high protein cattle  
 feed.At present field beans give a    
 better return per acre than corn, and 
 form part of a crop rotation. Potatoes
 wheat,oilseed rape,barley and peas for
 animal feed were grown on Upper and   
 Lower Sparks farm,the peas were a     
 total loss,as they are harvested late 
 and the prolonged wet summer spoiled  
 them.                                 </content>
