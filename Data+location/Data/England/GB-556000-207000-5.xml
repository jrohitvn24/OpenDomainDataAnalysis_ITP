		<title>05Farming Butt Hatch Mr. Read</title>
		<content> Mr. Read farms Butt Hatch. Beauchamp  
 Roding.   The farm is an amalgamtion  
 of what used to be four farms -       
 Hornets, Proctors, Slades and Butt    
 Hatch.   One of his dreams for the    
 future would be to see the return of  
 small farms.   He has farmed all his  
 life,his family having owned Butt     
 Hatch for over one hundred years.   He
 employs one full time man and one part
 time man to farm over six hundred     
 acres.   Twenty five years ago they   
 needed five full time men.            
 They drill two hundred weight to an   
 acre and expect three to four tons    
 yield.   It takes an average of two   
 and a half days to drill.   He sprays 
 for black grass, may weed, chick weed,
 bind weed, knot grass, field pansies  
 and nettles.
