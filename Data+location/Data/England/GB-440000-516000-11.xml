		<title>11The Stockton Cycle Route</title>
		<content> The Stockton Cycle Route is a         
 continuous three mile long route for  
 pedestrians and cyclists,linking      
 Bishopsgarth,Hardwick,Fairfield and   
 Grangefield with Stockton Town Centre.
 It has been introduced to provide safe
 and pleasant conditions for cycling to
 school,shops and work or for leisure. 
 A number of special facilities have   
 been provided along the route.The     
 Stockton cycle route is particularly  
 significant since it is part of the   
 Department of Transport's cycle route 
 programme .This consists of a number  
 of projects in various  parts of the  
 country which will be used to study   
 the effect on cycle usage of providing
 major cycle routes in towns and       
 cities.
