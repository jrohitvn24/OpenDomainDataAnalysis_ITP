		<content> Some of the{houses in Kempston Rural  
 vary in age from 300 years to under   
 5 years. Box End House, Church End    
 cottages and Kempston House and nearby
 cottages were built in the 14th       
 century from{bricks made from local   
{clay.}The residents appreciate its    
 beauty and peace. They value the      
 privacy of their own gardens and views
 of fields, trees and the river.       
 Gardening, walking, cycling, horse-   
 riding and studying nature are        
 favourite leisure occupations. There  
 are nurseries &amp; riding stables in the 
 area and the{River Ouse}is renowned   
 for its fishing. It is also used by a 
 nearby Youth Centre to teach people   
 canoeing. There are plenty of{mature  
{trees}affording a natural habitat for 
 wildlife and providing favourite      
 playing places for children, and of   
 interest to photographers &amp; artists.  </content>
