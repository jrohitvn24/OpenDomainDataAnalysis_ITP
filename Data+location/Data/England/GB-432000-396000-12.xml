 our area but due to school surveys and
 public protest a{3 ton weight limit

 houses and schools.                   
 An area of mixed private and council  
 housing and{80% of families own a car,
 60% of these being British. The age of
 cars was difficult to establish, but  
 it seems approximately{10% have a 'B' 
{registration.}Just under 50% are over 
 3 years old. Red and blue are popular 
 colours.                              
{28%}of the population use the M1 on a 
 daily basis.{70%}of families use cars 
 for shopping and pleasure and{61%}for 
 work - some using public transport for
