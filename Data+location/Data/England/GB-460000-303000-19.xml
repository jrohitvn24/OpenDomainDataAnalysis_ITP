		<title>19Wildlife in East Leicester.</title>
		<content> Although we live in a city,there is   
 still a lot of wildlife in the parks, 
 open spaces &amp; in our gardens. In a    
 school survey it was found that mice  
 were the most common creatures seen in
 gardens,followed by hedgehogs,bats &amp;  
 squirrels. Occasionally a rat is      
 spotted &amp; if you live close to open   
 ground,a rabbit or even a fox. The    
 most common birds seen in gardens are 
 starlings &amp; sparrows. There are also  
 blackbirds,thrushes &amp; robins. Bigger  
 birds like pigeon,seagulls,crows,     
 jackdaws &amp; even the occasional magpie 
 will visit city gardens. House martins
 &amp; swallows are quite common,as are    
 blue tits &amp; great tits. Present,but   
 more difficult to see are the owls &amp;  
 wrens.
