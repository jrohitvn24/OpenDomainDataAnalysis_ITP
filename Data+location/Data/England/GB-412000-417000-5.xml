		<title>05THE COMMUNITY CENTRE</title>
		<content> We interviewed Margaret Little about  
 the community centre and her job as   
 its leader.                           
 The centre was built in 1979 and      
 finished in 1980 but was not opened   
 until 1981.  The centre was built for 
 people who live in this area.  About  
 150 people come to the centre weekly. 
 There are lots of classes to join     
 including yoga, art and learning other
 languages.  The hall can be hired for 
 private events.                       
 Margaret is the only paid worker      
 apart from 2 cleaners and 2 youth     
 workers.  All the rest are volunteers.
 Margaret is the full time leader for  
 the Birkby and Fartown centre.  She   
 works 37 hours a week.  She has been  
 working here for 9 months.            
 The centre sells pop,crisps and sweets
 but it is not licensed to sell        
 alcohol.                              </content>
