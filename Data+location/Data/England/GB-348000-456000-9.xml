		<content> As you drive up to the university you 
 see a tall pointed tower. This is the 
 Chaplaincy Centre. The Chaplaincy     
 Centre has many different communities 
 like Methodist, Roman Catholic,       
 Anglican etc in the same building. The
 communities are in different rooms and
 above the rooms are flats for the     
 clergy to live. The Chaplaincy Centre 
 is shaped like a clover with 3 tall   
 spires with a cross on the top of one 
 of them. Inside the Chaplaincy Centre 
 are meeting places to talk and plan   
 things and on Sunday nights other     
 people from other religions entertain 
 each other. As well as church services
 the entertainment consists of guitar  
 playing, singing or an interesting    
 talk. The Chaplaincy Centre is the    
 biggest centre of religion in         
 Lancaster and people from outside the 
 university come to worship there.     </content>
