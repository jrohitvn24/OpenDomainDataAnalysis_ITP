		<content> The few houses on the farming land are
 widely scattered and most were built  
 over a 100 years ago or more.They have
 electricity and water supply but most 
 have cess_pit drainage.Some of the    
 houses have been bought by non_farming
 families e.g. Neal's farm house.In the
 south east area there is high density 
 housing.Most houses in Rose Green and 
 North Bersted were built between 1911 
 and 1930.A small area near Grosvenor  
 Gardens and Carlton Avenue was built  
 1930_1959.The rest of Rose Green and  
 the housing at West Meads was built   
 after 1960.The main house_type is     
 semi_detatched or bungalow.More than  
 80% are privately owned,have 2 or 3   
 bedrooms,small gardens and all main   
 services.Many roads have houses or    
 bungalows built in the same style.It  
 is a popular area for retired people.
