		<title>05MEON ELECTRICAL CONTRACTS</title>
		<content> By the very title of the Company it is
 clear that we carry out a very varied 
 service to the community conveying    
 from General Domestic Repairs,such as 
 kettles,irons,toasters,heaters,light  
 and plugs etc.,up to repairs and      
 installations for farmers who carry a 
 vast amount of electrical             
 equipment,and seem to be the most     
 vulnerable to breakdowns in the early 
 hours of the morning at the start of  
 milking,and of course there is usually
 a panic of some kind when it comes to 
 harvesting time.Also there are a      
 number of factories both large and    
 small in a 5 mile radius of the       
 village,giving employment to the      
 community in one form or another.
