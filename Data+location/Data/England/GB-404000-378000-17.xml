		<title>17DOVE HOLE'S BAND.</title>
		<content> Dove Holes Band was formed in l877.   
 During recent years the number of     
 playing members has gradually dwindled
 from 26 to 12.For this reason the band
 have formed an alliance with Peak Dale
 Band who were in a similar position.  
 The new name,Dove Holes Alliance Band,
 is only for registration with the     
 Brass Band Association to enable the  
 combined bands to enter contests. The 
 administration of each band is still  
 kept separate.Both bands still exist  
 in their own right.They practice twice
 each week. The instruments are all    
 brass.Out of approx.25 engagements    
 each year about 8 involve marching.   
 Alton Towers,Chatsworth Park,Godley   
 Whit Walks &amp; Buxton Pavilion Gardens  
 are among places at which they per-   
 form.The ratio of men to women is 3:1.
