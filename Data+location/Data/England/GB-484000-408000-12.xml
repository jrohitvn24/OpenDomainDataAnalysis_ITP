		<title>12Burringham Village.</title>
		<content> Burringham village is built on the    
 east bank of the River Trent. In it   
 there are houses and bungalows which  
 are quite new and older farmhouses and
 farm cottages. It also has a pub named
 The Ferryboat because it has been     
 built on the site where a ferry used  
 to go across the river. A road goes   
 through the village and follows the   
 river. The paths are very narrow in   
 places.                               
 I do not think I would like to live   
 there because you could easily get run
 over.                                 
 Some of the houses have a small back  
 garden with a bank at the back. Just  
 over the bank is the River Trent.     
 One of the houses has the date it was 
 built on it.                          
 It was built in 1881 so it is 104     
 years old.
