 We dont play many games now; we'd     
 rather sit around and talk to each    
 other,but when we were small we played
 a lot of different games.             
                                       
 There was "Billy 1,2,3" like hide and 
 seek. You have to hide and if the     
 catcher sees you he has to shout      
 "Billy 1,2,3" and say where you are.  
 There were loads of popular skipping  
 games to rhymes and songs.            
                                       
 Then there was "Bunny Through         
 the Hole"-another chase game.If you   
 are caught you have to stand dead     
 still.You can only be released by     
 someone who is still free crawling    
 through your legs.The last person to  
 be caught would be the catcher for the
 next game.                            </content>
