		<content> In{BRAMLEY}we have quite a lot of     
 Transport. We have got a station      
 with trains coming in every hour and  
 a bus service with buses running      
 every hour.The most popular form of   
 transport in{BRAMLEY}is by car.In{    
{STRATFIELD-SAYE}they have not got a   
 bus service or station.               
 In the olden days the people didn't   
 have cars, trains, lorries or buses.  
 The only transport they had was       
 bikes, by foot and horse and cart     
 but some people couldn't afford a     
 horse and cart.                       
 After the car had been invented it was
 easier to travel. Most people         
 couldn't afford a car so they had to  
 buy a bike or a horse and cart.       
 Nowadays we have all the transport we 
 need, like cars, buses, trains and    
 lorris, although some people still    
 enjoy horse riding.           M LEY {E</content>
