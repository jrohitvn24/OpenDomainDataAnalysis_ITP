		<title>16Woods at Everleigh</title>
		<content> Throughout the area there are numerous
 copses both conferous and deciduous.  
 One copse of note is that known       
 locally in Everleigh as Alma Clump.   
 This clump of trees was laid out by   
 Sir John Astley on his return from the
 Battle of Alma in 1854 in the Crimean 
 War. The shape of the copse is a      
 replica of the defensive position of  
 the Scots Fusilier Guards at the      
 Battle of Alma.                       
 Some of the aforrested land provides  
 cover for troops in training in the   
 area and homes for Pheasants,         
 Partridge and Deer.
