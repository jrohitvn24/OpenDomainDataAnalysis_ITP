		<content> Each year,there is a regatta held on  
 the water of West Mersea island on the
 17th of August.There are lots of      
 events for everyone to do.There are   
 about ten events altogether,they      
 are:4 yacht races,a fishing boat      
 race,outboard race,skulling           
 race,rowing race,winkle brig          
 race,greasy pole and the best dressed 
 boat.After all the results and prizes 
 have been given out,there are quite a 
 lot of fireworks which last for about 
 40 minutes.Then there is a fair not   
 far away where there are lots of      
 things to ride on and lots of prizes  
 that you might be lucky to win.The    
 fair closes at about 10'0'clock,but   
 opens again for the next two days and 
 nights,although the regatta is only   
 shown once.There are lots of people   
 who attend either as participants or  
 spectators.                           </content>
