		<title>06MY DAY AS A SHIFT-WORKER</title>
		<content>     Most men in our area who do shift-
work, work at Fords' Car Factory.   We 
talked to two shiftworkers,  who said  
that they work nights for two weeks and
days for two weeks.  They preferred to 
work nights because it was quiet and   
they could get on with their work      
better. They also felt that they had   
more free time during the day because  
they seemed to need less sleep.        
     Most men preferred to work in     
winter rather then summer, because     
when they came home from work it was   
dark, but in summer it was too light   
and they had difficulty sleeping.      
     During the day shift the men      
worked normal hours, but at night the  
timetable was very different.  They    
clocked on at 9.30 p.m., had "morning  
break" at midnight. "Lunch" was about  
3 a.m. The second break was about 5    
a.m. and they left work at 7 a.m.      </content>
