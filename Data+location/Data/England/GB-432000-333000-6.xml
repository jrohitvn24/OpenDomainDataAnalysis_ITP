		<content>    Nearly half the food he stocks     
 is{Asian.} He thinks customers prefer 
 to buy this from him, rather than at  
 the supermarket, because he can       
 explain how it should be prepared.    
 The owner collects most stock himself 
 but some Asian food is delivered fron 
 London where he can get a greater     
 variety.  Comparing the shops, it was 
 found that the supermarket stocks     
 about twice as many brands and        
 varieties, in greater quantities, than
 the small shop.  The supermarket      
 stayed open until 8.00 pm on two      
 evenings, against six evenings at the 
 small shop.  Both surveys showed that 
 customers were regular though they    
 shopped for food elsewhere as well.   
 Between 2.00 pm and 2.40 pm on a      
 Monday afternnon, 125 customers       
 entered the supermarket against 16    
 entering the small shop.              </content>
