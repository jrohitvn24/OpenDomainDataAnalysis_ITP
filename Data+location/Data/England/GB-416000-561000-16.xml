		<title>16GREENBANKS PRE_FABS BLAYDON.</title>
		<content>                                       
  There are twenty one pre-fabs at     
 Greenbanks which is a small estate    
 located opposite St. Thomas More R.C. 
 School. They were built in 1946 as    
 short term housing for people who came
 back after the last war. These houses 
 are made of corrugated asbestos       
 panels. They have three bedrooms,     
 alounge, a kitchen and a bathroom. The
 occupants expressed lots of complaints
 about the pre-fabs. Many of them are  
 over fifty years of age and complain  
 about "the damp draughty roofs", "the 
 gardens are too large to manage","the 
 street lights do not work","the estate
 misses out on normal things such as   
 telephone boxes and post boxes". The  
 occupants found the pre-fabs were hot 
 in summer and cold in the winter. The 
 majority of people thought the houses 
 should be knocked down and re-built.  </content>
