		<title>14OPEN DAY</title>
		<content>  Once every year, at our school, we   
 have an open day. All the children    
 decorate their classrooms. Then on a  
 special afternoon the parents come to 
 school and see all the childrens work.
 There are also other activities e.g., 
 swimming, tennis, and games on the    
 football pitch. Beforehand all the    
 children from our school go and visit 
 all the other classes to see their    
 beautiful work. At the end of the     
 afternoon all the children who are    
 going to leave bring their parents to 
 the hall and sit down. Then the head  
 master makes a speech and a special   
 visitor presents all the children from
 the top class with a book that they   
 choose themselves. This is what Mont  
 Nicolle school is like, on open day in
 the 1980s .
