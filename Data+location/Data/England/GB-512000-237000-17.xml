		<title>17ROWNEY WARREN</title>
		<content> Near to Shefford is a wood called     
{Rowney Warren}where people go to take 
 their dogs for walks and to have      
 picnics.There is a nature trail which 
 was made by the children at Robert    
 Bloomfield SChool.The Warren used to  
 be called Shefford Common and it used 
 to belong to the people of Shefford.  
    We found a letter from Dorothy     
 Osborne who lived at Chicksands Priory
 in the 17th century. She says she used
 to walk over the common to talk to the
 shepherdesses from Shefford.          
    In the Middle Ages people dug there
 for iron stone and melted it to get   
 the iron out.We saw the holes they    
 left.                                 
    In the 3rd century there was a kiln
 in the Warren for making pottery to   
 sell to local farmers.We have some of 
 the broken pots in our school.
