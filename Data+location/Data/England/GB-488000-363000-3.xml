		<title>03GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content> Thorpe on the Hill has several{gravel 
{pits}that have been proposed for      
 refuse tips.                          
     Leaflets have been distributed in 
 the village warning and asking        
 villagers to take action against it.  
     Most people are against the       
 proposal because the filling of the   
 pits could take as long as eight years
 to be completed.Another complaint is  
 that more traffic would travel through
 the village possibly as many as two   
 hundred heavy goods vehicles a day and
 an increasing amount of private       
 vehicles at weekends.Another cause    
 for complaint is the unhygienic       
 conditions it would create for the    
 villagers.                            
       {So the pits future is          
{debatable!                            
                                       
                                       </content>
