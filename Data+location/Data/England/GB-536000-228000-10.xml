 This first took place in 1981 and has 
 become an annual event. Some hundreds 
 of runners take part, many of them    
 using it as part of their training    
 for the London Marathon at Easter. The
 runners are sponsored. Most of the    
 money raised goes to Cancer Research, 
 but in 1984 some was used for Doctors'
 cars, a Heart Machine and sports      
 equipment for Ward Freman School.     
                                       
 Funfairs visit Buntigfod twice a year,
 at the Norfolk Road playing fields.   
 They have Dodgems, Space 2000 and many
 other exciting things.                
                                       
 Once a year, there is a Five-a-side   
 soccer competition for teams from all 
 over Hertfordshire. It is run by Mr.  
 Colin Page.                           </content>
