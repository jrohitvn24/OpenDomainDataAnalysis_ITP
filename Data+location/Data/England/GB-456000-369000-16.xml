		<title>16Unemployment-the CTF project</title>
		<content> One way of improving the neighbourhood
 in this area is by making use of the  
 Community Task Force.The C.T.F.       
 project is designed to give work to   
 unemployed young people.At Cuckney    
 they are at present renovating the    
 churchyard.The workers are aged from  
 17 to 25 and do the work for one year.
 They receive a wage of Â£54 per        
 week.The young people are from Warsop,
 Shirebrook and Ollerton.They learn how
 to do brick-laying,land sculpture etc.
 Mr Lewis and his chargehand instruct  
 them.No special skills are required   
 before they can join the project.They 
 work 24 hours 30 minutes per week with
 different people working at different 
 times in teams.When they have finished
 they hope that their experience will  
 enable them to apply successfully for 
 a permanent job somewhere although    
 these are scarce at the present time. </content>
