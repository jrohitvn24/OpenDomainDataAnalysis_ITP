		<content> MARAZION STANDS ON ONE OF THE OLDEST  
 SETTLEMENT SITES IN THE COUNTRY.      
                                       
 DESPITE BEING THE ORIGINAL TRADING    
 CENTRE FOR THE AREA IT HAS NOT GROWN  
 NOR DECLINED OVER THE YEARS,AND IT IS 
 NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TOWN    
 TRUST.                                
 THE TRUST WAS FORMED IN 1890 ON THE   
 ORDERS OF THE CHARITY COMMISSIONER,TO 
 TAKE CHARGE OF THE PROPERTY FORMERLY  
 OWNED BY THE MARAZION.CORPORATION     
 THE INCOME COMES FROM INVESTMENTS AND 
 RENTS FOR THE HIRE OF THE TOWN HALL.  
 THERE ARE NINE TRUSTEES,FIVE ARE      
 ELECTED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL AND FOUR  
 ARE CO-OPTED.                         
 THE ORIGINAL TOWN CHARTER WAS GIVEN BY
 QUEEN ELIZABETH 1 IN 1595 AND THIS IS 
 STILL IN THE POSSESSION OF THE TOWN   
 TRUST,AS WELL AS OTHER VERY OLD       
 CHATTLES AND DOCUMENTS.               </content>
