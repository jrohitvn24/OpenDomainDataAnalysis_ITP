		<title>19BROOM HILL PARK</title>
		<content>  Broom Hill is a very popular park    
where people go to give their dogs a   
walk, and children to play on the slide
and swings.                            
  Some junior schools have their Sports
Day in the field and many older boys   
play football here too.  Joggers also  
jog there in the morning and evening.  
  You can easily notice, if you go     
there first thing in the morning that  
vandals have been there, because beer  
cans have been smashed up and trodden  
on as well as graffiti on the benches  
and ground.                            
  If you go to the top of the hill you 
can see a fascinating view.  You can   
see all of Rochester including the     
Castle, Bridge, Cathedral and also     
Chatham Pentagon.                      
  It is a place where you go to think  
and have a bit of peace.
