		<title>11MILL ENGINEERING COMPANY</title>
		<content> This firm started in 1956 and has     
 since 1975 occupied its present site  
 of about 2 acres on the disused       
 airfield in Ablington. The main repair
 shop and administrative offices are   
 housed in one of the 3 old hangars,   
 since repaired and re-roofed, the     
 others being used for storage. The    
 main function of the firm is the      
 repair of agricultural machinery such 
 as combine harvesters, bailers etc.,  
 most of which work is carried out in  
 situ on farms. Spare parts are        
 collected daily from Bury St. Edmunds 
 and distributed all over the West of  
 England. In addition, agricultural    
 machinery is imported, mostly from    
 Germany, for resale. The firm gives   
 employment to about 23 people, most of
 whom live locally.
