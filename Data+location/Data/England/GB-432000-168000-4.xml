		<title>04Twinning of Hungerford.</title>
		<content> Hungerford was twinned with Ligueil   
 in 1979 by a man called Mr.Williams.He
 first contacted Madame and Monsieur   
 Canneton.                             
   Ligueil is in the centre of France  
 in the Loire Valley.It is similar to  
 Hungerford because it has schools,a   
 river, a church, an Old Peoples Home  
 and is surrounded by farms.           
  Mr. Williams chose France because he 
 likes it there and he wants the people
 of Hungerford to become more friendly 
 with the people of Ligueil.           
   Now an annual event is an exchange  
 visit between people of the two       
 towns.In addition to this pupils who  
 study French at the comprehensive     
 school visit Ligueil with there       
 teachers to improve their French,     
 while French boys and girls come to   
 Hungerford to improve their English.  
 This has taken place for 6 years.     </content>
