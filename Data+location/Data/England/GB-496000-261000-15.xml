		<title>15THE FRIENDLY CLUB</title>
		<content> The Club meets on the first Thursday  
 of the month in Souldrop{Village Hall.
 It was originally intended for the    
 older people within the village       
 itself, but people also come now from 
 the villages around.                  
                                       
 The Club takes responsibility for     
 running the annual{street fair}held in
 the high street and on the village    
 green on a Saturday in June.  There   
 are usually about twenty stalls, some 
 run by people from Sharnbrook.  The   
 proceeds are used to finance outings  
 and a Christmas party, any surplus    
 being given to national or local      
{charities.}Refreshments (teas etc.)   
 are sold in gardens. Stalls include   
 cakes, groceries, garden produce,     
 plants, bric-a-brac,books,crafts,rag  
 dolls and a tombola.
