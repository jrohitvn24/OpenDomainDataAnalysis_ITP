		<content> When the wood is finished it is dipped
 in cedar preserve called Cuprinol:    
 they use 500 gallon tanks. This helps 
 to preserve it in winter.They use a   
 variety of machines such as a double  
 ender, a spindle, a cross cut machine 
 and a ply saw.In the sawmill there is 
 a glass work shop where windows are   
 fitted. They use Russian glass:a      
 British glass is too expensive. The   
 glass is cut with a tiny wheel which  
 makes an indentation in the glass,    
 enough for it to be snapped down the  
 middle.They send the glass out to the 
 customer,wrapped in hay.The mill also 
 supplies roofing felt.They try not to 
 do retail sale and the sawdust which  
 is not needed is sold to local        
 farmers.
