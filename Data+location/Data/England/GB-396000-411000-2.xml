		<content>{Kitcliff farm}is a mixed dairy farm   
 in the{Piethorne valley,} a part      
 of the{Pennine chain.}If you go to    
 Kitcliff farm in the spring you will  
 see lots of signs that say{"DO NOT    
{HANDLE THE LAMBS".}This is because    
 the lambs would pick up your scent,   
 follow you around and their mother    
 would abondon them.As the farm is a   
 mixed dairy farm they have{sheep,     
{goats,poultry,five bulls and freisian 
{cows}.As we were walking up the hills 
 we noticed that the{foothills}were    
 very green, but at the{upland farm}the
 grass was a more yellow colour.This is
 because the foothill farmer puts      
{organic fertiliser}on the fields to   
 keep them healthy. The farmer is not  
 allowed to put{inorganic}fertiliser on
 the fields without permission from the
{water board.
