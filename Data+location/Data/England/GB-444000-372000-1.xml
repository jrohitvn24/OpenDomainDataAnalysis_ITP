    Four main built up areas house most
 of the population in our area, they   
 are:                                  
{Duckmanton Netherthorpe Woodthorpe}and
{Shuttlewood.}                         
   None of these settlements is very   
 large, Netherthorpe and Woodthorpe are
 villages whilst Duckmanton is a       
 village with a housing estate and     
 Shuttlewood is the largest.           
   The area is a mixture  of industry  
 and agriculture, the main industry    
 being{mining}whilst the agriculture is
 mainly{arable.}                       
  {Railway}lines interlace the area    
 though many of these are no longer in 
 service. The{M1 Motorway}also cuts    
 through the middle of the area.       
   It is an area with a long and       
 interesting history stretching back to
 Stone Age times.                      </content>
