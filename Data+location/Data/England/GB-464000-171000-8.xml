		<title>08EMPLOYMENT.CALCOT,READING</title>
		<content> Employment in the Calcot area is not  
 the problem it is in other areas of   
 the country.In fact Calcot is         
 experiencing an influx of people from 
 the North and Midlands,who are moving 
 here to find work.                    
   Computers,one of the major growth   
 industries,attracts many people,from  
 experienced programmers and analysts  
 to 'chip'makers and testers.          
   The Savacentre hypermarket has      
 provided much local work,and has      
 greatly helped the unemployment       
 situation in the West Reading area.   
   Most people commute to work.Some    
 undertaking quite long journies as far
 afield as London,Bristol,Bath and     
 Oxford.                               
   The situation for young people is   
 improving,with many choosing jobs in  
 electronics,the motor trade,the       
 building trade,and nursery nursing.   </content>
