		<title>11THE CANAL IN ADLINGTON.</title>
		<content> The Macclesfield Canal, opened in 1831
 for transport, is now used for        
 recreation, mainly boating , walking  
 and fishing. It is popular with people
 who have motor-launches kept at       
 "Marinas" built on the canal and with 
 canoeists. There are many hire-boats, 
 both motor-launches and converted     
 narrow boats. Recently the tow-path   
 has been repaired and stiles put in   
 so that walkers  can link the canal   
 with the new "Middlewood Way" walk.   
 Many bridges have stone steps from the
 roads to the tow-path and these have  
 been restored. This work was carried  
 out by the Borough Council with       
 finance from the Countryside          
 Commission and labour from the        
 Manpower Services Commission. There is
 a wealth of wild flowers and bird-life
 for naturalists to enjoy.
