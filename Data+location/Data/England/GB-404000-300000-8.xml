		<title>08  Aldridge Fire Station</title>
		<content> Aldridge Fire Station covers the area 
 from Chasewater, on one side, to      
 Walsall on the other. One fire engine 
 is on permanent alert and will leave  
 the station 30 seconds after the      
 emergency call is made. Fire engines  
 take precedence on the road in an     
 emergency and travel at speeds above  
 the legal limit, driving through      
 traffic lights if necessary. Aldridge 
 Fire Station receives about 1,000     
 calls to attend fires in a year, but  
 also receives calls to rescue trapped 
 animals or children. Hoax calls are   
 made also which create a danger as a  
 serious emergency could arise while   
 the hoax call is being investigated. A
 variety of extinguishers are used     
 depending on the fire. Oil, diesel and
 petrol fires are fought with foam,    
 carbon dioxide for electric fires and 
 water jets for many types of fire.    </content>
