		<title>06Whiteparish Saddler</title>
		<content>{Mr. J.W.Hyde has worked at these      
{premises for just 60 years this year. 
 This has however been a saddler's     
 workshop for{over 250 years}to his    
 knowledge. When he started, most of   
 the work was for farm horses, also for
 people who drove their horses &amp; traps 
 to Salisbury &amp; Romsey markets etc. for
 shopping. He does not actually make   
 saddles now as he is on his own &amp; has 
 many repairs,new bridles, head collars
 &amp; other tack to make. It used to take 
 a full week to make 3 saddles, each of
 which took about 4 sq.feet of leather.
 The biggest demand now is for riding, 
 showing &amp; driving harness for the show
 rings. The quantity of work is about  
 the same now as when he started, there
 are still farm horses and some still  
 drive their traps for pleasure.       
{GEORGE B.TILL,}still appears above the
 shop front. (previous owner)          </content>
