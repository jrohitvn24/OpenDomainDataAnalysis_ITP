 On Thursday 23 May,we interviewed Mrs 
 Pullan.When we got there we found out 
 that it was closed,so we waited until 
 2:00pm.When she got back we went      
 inside to interview her.She told us   
 that she didn't have a main customer, 
 but lots of regular customers.She was 
 brought up in a shop in London but got
 bored of it and came to Landbeach to  
 start up her own shop.Her main        
 products are cigarettes and sweets.A  
 Mr Wangler supplied her products twice
 a week.Her shop wasn't designed, she  
 said it already had lots of shelves   
 when she got there.The shop name came 
 from her own,MC Pullan.Her shop was   
 built over 200 years ago.She said it  
 would make it much easier if there    
 were more shops in Landbeach.
