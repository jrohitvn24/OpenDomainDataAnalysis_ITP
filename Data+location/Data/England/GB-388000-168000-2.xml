		<title>02Employment in Lacock</title>
		<content> As Lacock is a small village in a     
 rural area, very few people are       
 employed locally.                     
 Some find work on local farms, in the 
 egg packing factory and in the garden 
 centre, and in the village itself     
 seasonal work is available in tourist 
 related industries like food          
 preparation and cleaning of the Abbey.
 Most people who live in and around    
 Lacock, therefore, have to travel to  
 Melksham, Chippenham and Trowbridge to
 find employment. They pursue a wide   
 variety of trades and professions     
 varying from managing director of a   
 national company, a bank manager,     
 college lecturers and a thatcher to   
 factory workers and lorry drivers.    
 Unfortunately there is some           
 unemployment and school leavers in the
 area find it hard to find suitable    
 work.                                 </content>
