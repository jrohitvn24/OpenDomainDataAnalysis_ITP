		<title>13EMPLOYMENT,DUNTISBOURNE AREA</title>
		<content> In this area there was a 12%          
 unemployment rate in 1981,although the
 people today say there are very few   
 villagers without jobs.A quarter of   
 the total population are retired so   
 many were seen gardening or doing odd 
 jobs around the village.18% are under 
 16 and would be attending local Junior
 or Secondary schools.There was little 
 work to be found in the immediate area
 and pupils were told that there are no
 longer any of the old craftsmen in the
 villages.Most working inhabitants go  
 elsewhere-Cheltenham,Gloucester and   
 Cirencester,even up to London.There is
 a stable in Winstone where some young 
 people can work as grooms and there is
 also farmwork but the number employed 
 on farms is reducing.
