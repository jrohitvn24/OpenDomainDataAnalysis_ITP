		<title>01Felton and Ocle Pychard Area</title>
		<content> The area surveyed covers the parishes 
 of Felton, Preston Wynne, Ullingswick 
 and Ocle Pychard, ten miles north-east
 of Hereford.  The area is one of mixed
 farming.  There are eleven farms over 
 twenty hectares, and fourteen under   
 twenty hectares.  The region contains 
 three complete villages, Felton,      
 Burley Gate and Ocle Pychard, and     
 parts of the villages of Preston Wynne
 and Ullingswick.  Three hundred and   
 fifty adults and fifty children live  
 here.  There is also a Post Office,   
 Garage, Primary School and Police     
 Station at Burley Gate.  The Post     
 Office and Garage also sell groceries.
 The farms are chiefly for dairying,   
 and growing of cereals, potatoes and  
 hops.
