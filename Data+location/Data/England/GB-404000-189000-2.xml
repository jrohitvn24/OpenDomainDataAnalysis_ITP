		<title>02FARMING IN NORTH WILTS</title>
		<content> There are five farms with their       
 farmhouses in this block, plus parts  
 of other farms which are centred on   
 adjoining blocks. All the farms are   
 run by the families that own them, and
 all are dairy or beef producers with  
 the exception of one farm which is    
 arable, processing grass to make      
 animal feed for sale.                 
 The cows kept are fresians and all the
 milk produced goes to the nearby Co-op
 Wholesale Society Dairy at Latton.
