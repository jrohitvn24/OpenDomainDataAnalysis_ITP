		<content> Berkeley farm is one of 4 farms owned 
 by the Gosling family.The farm is     
 situated just off the road called     
 Mormead.The farm is  850 acres.It is  
 50% arable and 50% dairy.Sixteen      
 workers work on the farm 8 work on the
 arable side 2 work on processing the  
 milk and 6 work on delivering the     
 milk.Altogether there is 190          
 cows.The farm does not get all of its 
 milk from its own cows.Some of the    
 milk it sells comes from other farms. 
    The products sold include whole and
 skimmed milk,sterilized milk,eggs and 
 fruit juice brought in from other     
 farms.                                
    The farm bottles its own milk.     
 Before the farm got its own dairy, the
 milk had to be sent to London.        
    Berkeley Farm delivers milk to     
 Swindon and Wroughton.
