		<title>13Types of Housing in St.Agnes</title>
		<content> Many of the old cottages are built of 
 cob, a mixture of clay and straw      
 that makes very thick walls. These    
 make very warm buildings. A few still 
 have thatched roofs, but these are now
 a minority. Many new housing estates  
 have sprung up in recent years - the  
 newer houses being built of           
 breezeblock. Bungalows abound - mostly
 two or three bedroomed to accommodate 
 the smaller families. Council estates 
 house a large number of people in     
 small but compact houses -            
 semi-detached, rather than terraced.  
 The farmhouses are built of stone and 
 are very solid. The Cornish hedge     
 usually encloses the gardens. Hotels  
 and Guest houses are constructed of   
 stone, and in some of the older types 
 Cornish granite has been incorporated 
 to form the doorways and steps.
