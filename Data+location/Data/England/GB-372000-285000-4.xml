 studies of pollution,rocks and        
 fossils,glass and the Normans.We go   
 out on lots of visits and then come   
 back and find out more about the      
 places we visit.                      
     We have some very nice reading    
 books and interesting reference books 
 for our projects.We sometimes watch   
 and listen to the educational         
 television and radio programmes.

 and games and we have school teams for
 football,netball and athletics.We go
