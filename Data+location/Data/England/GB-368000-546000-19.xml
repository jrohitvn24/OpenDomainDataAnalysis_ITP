		<title>19GARDENING ON ALSTON MOOR</title>
		<content> Gardening is very limited around      
 Alston Moor because of the climate.   
 The town lies 1000 feet above sea     
 level and has a short growing season. 
 The built-up areas are the best places
 for flowers to grow because of the    
 shelter from the houses. The potatoes 
 and other root crops are protected in 
 the soil.                             
 There are two main problems for       
 gardeners, which are high winds and   
 heavy rainfall. These occur most      
 months of the year.                   
 The Flower Show is popular with the   
 gardeners and usually has a large     
 number of entries depending on the    
 weather of the months preceding the   
 show. All special prizes are donated  
 for the show (cups, shields etc.).
