		<title>15Living in the country</title>
		<content> I have lived in the country all my    
 life.  I like it in the country       
 because it is peaceful.  I like to    
 look at the nice{scenery}and I like   
 taking my dog for a walk.             
                                       
 Some people say that it is boring     
 living in the country but I don't     
 agree with them.  I like looking at   
 all the{animals and flowers.} We get  
 lots of{birds}in the country.         
                                       
 I wouldn't like to live in the town   
 because it is too noisy and too dirty.
 You get vandals in towns that break   
 things and spoil them.  I think it    
 would be dangerous to go out at night 
 in towns.                             
                                       
 Sometimes I wish it wasn't so far to  
 the cinema.                           
                                       </content>
