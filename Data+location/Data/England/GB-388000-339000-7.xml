		<content>Throwing is the first stage to making  
pottery. They throw the clay onto an   
elecrically operated wheel. The clay   
they use is either Jasper or Basalt,   
but sometimes they use Bone China. It  
takes 7 years to train to be a thrower.
Turning is the second stage of making  
pottery. A turner puts a rough clay    
shape on a turning machine and with a  
chisel he will shape it to the proper  
shape and size. The surplus clay is    
recycled. It takes 7 years to train to 
be a turner.                           
Figure making is the next stage of     
making pottery. The slip is poured into
a detailed mould, and is then eased    
gently out with an instrument and the  
imprints are shown very clearly. It    
takes 6 months basic training to be a  
figure maker. Nearly all the figure    
makers are women.
