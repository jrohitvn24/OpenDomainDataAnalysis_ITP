		<title>18HORSINGTON HOUSE HOTEL</title>
		<content>  Horsington House was the home of the 
 Doddington family certainly from the  
 late 17th century until they left in  
 1922.                                 
  It was probably rebuilt in about     
 1840, after a disasterous fire,in a   
 Georgian style by Nikolaus Peusner    
 as"High Victorian Italianate".The     
 oak staircase was saved and now forms 
 the central feature of the hotel      
 foyer.                                
  Since 1922 Horsington House has been 
 variously used by the Pioneer         
 Corps,the U.S. airforce and from 1946 
 until 1972 it was Dr.Barnardo's Home. 
  Since being converted into a hotel   
 there have been several owners and    
 Tatlerworth Limited,a small privately 
 owned country house hotel group have  
 been in occupation since July,1981.   
  1620 saw the first house on this     
 site.                                 </content>
