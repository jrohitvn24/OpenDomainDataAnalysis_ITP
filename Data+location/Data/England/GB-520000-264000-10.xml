		<content> Due to the growing population,the     
 numbers of children at Great Paxton   
 school have grown  from 47 in 1978 to 
 87 in 1985.The buildings cannot cope  
 with this continued growth. Already   
 there are three temporary classrooms, 
 with a fourth expected soon on        
 the site,with the old buildings being 
 used for the office,dining room and   
 hall.Cambridgeshire County Council    
 have decided that it would be best to 
 close Great Paxton and Offord         
 schools, and to build a new school on 
 the site at Offord. Offord's school   
 population is not growing in 1985 they
 have 90 puils ,but they do need a new 
 school building The parents in Great  
 Paxton objected to their children     
 having to travel to Offord by bus and 
 to losing their village school.
