		<content>{FAMOUS MANSION NEAR DUNSMORE          
 An estate of 14.5 hides on this site  
 is mentioned in the original Domesday 
 Book, but the first connection with   
 today's name of Chequers came 50yrs   
 later when the Scaccarios acquired the
 property. Their name meaning checker_ 
 board. The present house dates from   
 Tudor times when rebuilt by the       
 Hawtrey family who, with the Crokes   
 and Russells kept a fine family link  
 for many years. Lady Mary Grey, sister
 of Lady Jane, was held there and the  
 house has many Cronwellian relics.    
 More recently, it was in the Long     
 Gallery that the British and French   
 P.M's. agreed with General Smuts Of S.
 Africa &amp; Marshall Foch of France the  
 strategy of single command which at   
 last brought victory in the 1914_18   
 War. The last owner Lord Lee of       
 Fareham gave it to the nation in 1917.</content>
