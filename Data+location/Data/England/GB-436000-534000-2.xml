		<content> AT SCHOOL I LIKE TO PLAY"POLO" WITH MY
 FRIENDS.YOU MUST HAVE FOUR OR MORE    
 PLAYERS.ONE PERSON IS "ON" AND THE    
 OTHERS ARE WAITING FOR THE PERSON WHO 
 IS "ON" TO SAY, "A BASKET FULL OF     
 ---," BIKES FOR EXAMPLE.THEN THE      
 OTHERS HAVE TO THINK OF A BRAND NAME  
 AND SOMEONE SHOUTS THEM ALL OUT.THEN  
 THE PERSON WHO IS "ON" PICKS,         
 WHICH-EVER ONE SHE PICKS, THE PLAYER  
 WHO HAD PICKED THAT NAME BEFORE HAS TO
 RUN TO WHERE THE PERSON WHO WAS       
 "ON" STANDS,AND BACK AND THE PERSON   
 WHO WAS "ON" HAS TO RUN TO WHERE THE  
 OTHERS ARE STANDING, THEN BACK TO     
 WHERE SHE STARTED AGAIN. WHEN THEY    
 PASS THE LINE WHERE THEY STARTED THEY 
 SHOUT "POLO".THE ONE WHO SHOUTS "POLO"
 FIRST IS "ON". THEN THEY START AGAIN.
