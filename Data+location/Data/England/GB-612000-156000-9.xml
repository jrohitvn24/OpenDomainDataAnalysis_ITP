		<title>09Shopping in Canterbury</title>
		<content>   As Canterbury was extensively bombed
 during World War II much{rebuilding } 
 has gone on during the past 30 years. 
                                       
   The City centre has changed from    
 a wide variety of small locally owned 
 shops to there now being many large   
{chain stores.}Provision{shops}have    
 moved to the outskirts, providing     
 large{car parks}for customers use.    
                                       
   Canterbury is considered the        
 shopping centre of East Kent - the    
 majority of people being satisfied    
 with the selection of shops,          
 especially as The Marlowe Arcade was  
 opened in Spring 1985, but car parking
 is a problem, especially at week-ends.
