		<title>11 Moving into Lichfield</title>
		<content>    We asked everyone in school where  
their parents were born and we         
discovered a strange thing. Only eleven
children had parents who were born in  
Lichfield. Where had all of the other  
parents come from and why? Most came   
from towns and villages near Lichfield 
and others from towns in the           
Midlands. A small number came from     
Southern England, Wales and            
Scotland. Families have also moved from
India, Hong Kong and Cyprus. Most      
parents have moved because their work  
is here, or is easily reached with     
transport. The family from India came  
to get better qualifications and the   
families from Hong Kong and Cyprus have
opened restaurants and fish and chip   
shops. We are glad that all of the     
people moved in with their children.   
We would have been a small school with 
only eleven pupils.                    </content>
