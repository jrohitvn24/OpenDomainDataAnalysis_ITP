		<content>                                       
     The farmer at Folly farm has lived
there all his life.  His wife has been 
living there for three years.  They    
have one child and a dog.  One hundred 
and fifty years ago the farm belonged  
to Christchurch College, Oxford.       
     The farmer has to get up very     
early in the morning to start work     
around the farm.  He continues work    
until late at night.                   
     The farmhouse is very large in    
comparison to normal family homes.  It 
is very modern inside and the kitchen  
has all the usual gadgets and aids.    
One unusual feature is the large Aga   
solid fuel boiler and stove which      
becomes the centre of family life      
particarly in cold weather.
