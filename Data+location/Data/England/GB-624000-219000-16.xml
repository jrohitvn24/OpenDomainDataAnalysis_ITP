		<title>16ENTERTAINMENT PIER MANAGER</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr. Winter, manager of 
 the pier bowl. He said:" The pier is  
 an outing for the family. You usually 
 find that children come down with     
 their parents and it goes on year     
 after year after year. Walton isn't   
 really a commercialised town. It is   
 literally a town by the seaside.      
 People come down mainly for the beach 
 and the sea. People normally spend 3-4
 hours on the pier. It doesn't matter  
 if it's rainy or sunny because the    
 pier is under cover. People come down 
 mainly for the rides, bowling and     
 arcade." They try to improve the pier 
 all the time. In the old days, each   
 ride was owned by a family.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
