		<title>13Workplace of Bradley people.</title>
		<content>In some old papers about Bradley Free  
Grammar School,the professions of the  
parents of the children were listed.   
They all lived and worked in or near   
Bradley.Children from the school       
carried out a survey to find out where 
the people of Bradley work today.These 
were the questions which were asked:How
many people living in your house work? 
Where do they work-in Bradley parish,  
in Stafford the nearest town, or       
further away? What work do they do? It 
was found that 25% of the people       
interviewed worked in Bradley, 26% of  
the people worked in Stafford.Approx.  
35% of the people work some distance   
away.The rest of the people interviewed
-about 13% were retired. A hundred     
years ago most of the working people of
Bradley worked in farming.Very few do  
today. Most are office workers or work 
in industry.                           </content>
