		<content> The area surveyed contains a variety  
 of landscapes. To the west is the     
 Colne Valley and to the east the land 
 rises 500 feet towards Bushey Heath.  
 Two thirds of the area is open space. 
 To the west are extensive sports      
 fields and a golf course. To the north
 and east five farms, two stables,     
 a reservoir and Elstree aerodrome     
 form a rural landscape.Though barely  
 16 miles from Charing Cross the area  
 retains a leafy, independent          
 atmosphere. There are three jealously 
 guarded village communities, Oxhey,   
 Bushey and Letchmore Heath with highly
 valued Victorian and Edwardian        
 terraced and villa properties. There  
 are two large areas of dense housing  
 of uniform architectural design built 
 in the l950's and 1960's. There is    
 an abundance of schools in extensive  
 grounds.                              </content>
