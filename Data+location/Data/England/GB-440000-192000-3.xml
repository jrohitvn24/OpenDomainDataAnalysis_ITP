In our D-Block there is a large        
variety of houses, ranging from the    
very old  to the very new.             
THATCHED COTTAGES.                     
There are almost thirty thatched       
cottages in our block,with pretty      
walled gardens filled with roses. One  
cotage is being rethatched.            
MANOR HOUSES.                          
 There are three manor houses in the   
villages,two in West Hanney and one in 
East Hanney.Priors'Court in West Hanney
was mentioned in the original Domesday 
book.                                  
MODERN HOUSES.                         
The rest of the houses in our villages 
date from about the 1700's to modern   
times. They are built                  
in a variety of materials, mostly      
brick. Some of them are rendered and   
painted.                               </content>
