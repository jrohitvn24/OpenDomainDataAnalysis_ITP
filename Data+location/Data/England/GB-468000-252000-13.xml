		<title>13The Gayton village magazine</title>
		<content>The local magazine of Gayton is run by 
two ladies, living just outside the    
village. We asked them why they started
the "Gayton News".                     
 "Living out of the village along the  
Tiffield Road my neighbour and I       
decided that we were often last to     
hear about activities in the village   
especially during the winter months    
when we may not venture out for a week 
or more - so in October 1982, "Gayton  
News" was born. We decided that "Gayton
News" should be sold to raise funds for
the village hall and inform everyone of
events and also entertain. We hoped    
also to hear from all the committees   
or clubs in the village. We hoped that 
anyone moving to the village would be  
able to find out what Gayton had to    
offer. For the first year we invited   
subscribers to pay in advance - the    
circulation is now 175 copies."        </content>
