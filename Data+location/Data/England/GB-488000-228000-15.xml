		<content>{Stockgrove Park House}is today used as
 a school by the I.L.E.A.              
 There are 47 boys, 7/8 teachers,      
 8 child care assistants ,1            
 secretary(who's been                  
 there for 25 years)and 1 Headmaster   
 (who's been there for 15 years) and 1 
 assistant gardener. In 1982 the school
 was worth 1/4 of a million pounds with
 19 acres including the school. Before 
 the building was a school it was a    
 private house. It was built in 1929   
 and became a school in 1950.The       
 field's which contain animals do not  
 belong to Stockgrove but belong to Mr 
 Avery and Mrs Woodhouse.There are 2   
 lodges beside the gates, one of which 
 is empty the other is owned by Mrs    
 Housley.The house was renovated before
 she moved in.The people before her    
 bought a bit of the field behind the  
 house so they have a bigger garden.   </content>
