		<content>We are fortunate to have a good health 
care team consisting of a doctor,a     
health visitor with an assistant,a     
nurse, a midwife and the social        
services.                              
   The doctor is on call 24 hours. He  
visits the disabled,the chronic sick   
and the elderly who have difficulty in 
walking.A dispensary at the surgery    
saves journeys to the chemist in       
Henley.The district nursing sister     
visits the sick and teaches the family 
how to look after the ill.The midwife  
cares for mother and baby up to one    
month after birth.The health visitor is
specially trained to give advice up to 
school age and also arrange meals on   
wheels.The social services provide home
helps and arrange special visiting for 
the handicapped.Voluntary services     
provide meals on wheels and the British
Legion transport people to hospital.   </content>
