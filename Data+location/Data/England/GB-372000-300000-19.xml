		<title>19Local History In Norton Area</title>
		<content>   Stockton Norton School, which opened
 in 1858,was built by Thomas Whitmore  
 of Apley Park.  There was a school in 
 Norton before that _ at least as early
 as 1800.  There were also schools at  
 Sutton Maddock and Ryton, but both    
 closed some years ago.                
   The clock on our school was given by
 Isabella Foster of Apley Park, in     
 1897, to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond
 Jubilee.  A fountain on the roadside  
 at Sutton Maddock marks the same year.
   The builder's workshop , between    
 Harrington and Beckbury, used to be a 
 water pumping station for the Borough 
 of Wenlock.  The building just before 
 the bridge over the  River Worfe near 
 Beckbury was also an old pumping      
 station.  These are no longer used ,  
 as the area is now served by the      
 Severn Trent Water Authority.
