		<content> Ingatestone is mostly renowned for its
 historic hall (Ingatestone Hall) which
 has entertained people like Queen     
 Elizabeth I. Tourists can walk round  
 the hall and admire the great         
 architecture.                         
                                       
 The village of Ingatestone has its    
 Boys' Club, church, football team,    
 four pubs and many private businesses.
 The Boys' Club has its own snooker    
 tables and table tennis tables; the   
 hall is also used for private         
 functions. The football club runs a   
 number of teams from the under-10's to
 the mens' teams.                      
                                       
 The village has three schools, one for
 infants, one for juniors and the large
 Anglo-European School for 1000 senior 
 pupils.
