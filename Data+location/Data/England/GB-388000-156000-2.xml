		<content> There are five small housing estates  
 among the dwellings in the area, and  
 application has been made for a small 
 development of l2 more houses to be   
 built just off High Street.  The l98l 
 National Census showed 328 dwellings  
 in Steeple Ashton, of which 64 were   
 Council Houses, many of which have    
 since been purchased by their tenants,
 while privately owned houses numbered 
 264 of which 230 were owner occupied  
 and 34 rented or tied cottages.       
 Much of Steeple Ashton is designated  
 as a Conservation Area. In recent     
 years most new property has tended to 
 be of the 'executive type'. There is  
 very little family priced housing;    
 this means that local young people    
 when they marry move into nearby towns
 where there are homes for 'first time'
 buyers.                               
                                       </content>
