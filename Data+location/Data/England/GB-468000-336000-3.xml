		<content> This was converted from a school      
 building in 1970. It is  sited in the 
 centre of the village with gardens,   
 playground &amp; car-park. Facilities     
 include large hall with stage, two    
 smaller rooms, kitchen and cloakrooms.
 A caretaker &amp; gardener are employed.  
 It is the centre of public administr- 
 ation, a polling station for elections
 &amp; a valued social centre. The trustees
 are the Parish Council but administr- 
 ation is the responsibility of an     
 elected Management Committee which    
 meets monthly. The present committee  
 represents Parish Council, Tithby, the
 Churches, Young Farmers Club, Women's 
 Institute, Youth Club, Playgroup, &amp;   
 the Botiller Players, plus 6 elected &amp;
 1 co-opted member. Costs are met by   
 letting the Hall, &amp; by holding fund   
 raising events. A monthly Newsletter  
 informs the Village of all activities.</content>
