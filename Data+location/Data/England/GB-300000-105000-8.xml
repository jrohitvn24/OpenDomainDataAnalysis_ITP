		<title>08TRAFFIC IN CULLOMPTON</title>
		<content>   A motorway makes a difference.Before
 the motorway,traffic would fill the   
 main street from end to end,especially
 from June to September because of     
 tourists travelling through to holiday
 resorts.Shops,garages,pubs and        
 restaurants were very busy.The        
 motorway by_passes Cullompton.Now we  
 have few traffic jams but much less   
 business from tourists.               
   We conducted a short traffic survey 
 before the tourist season was in full 
 swing and found some 1 000 cars,300   
 lorries and vans were using the       
 motorway every hour during the        
 day,with some 400 cars and 50 vans and
 lorries passing through Cullompton.So 
 although the railway station is now   
 closed and all transport is by road   
 travel through Cullompton is now much 
 easier.
