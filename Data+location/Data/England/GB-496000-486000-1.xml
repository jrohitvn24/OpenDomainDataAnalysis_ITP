		<title>01Forge Valley Area</title>
		<content>  A varied block with a lot of natural 
 deciduous woodland as well as some    
 conifer planation.   The Forge valley 
 is a National Nature Reserve because  
 it contains some of the rare ancient  
 woodland and is little disturbed.     
 Above this steep sided valley on east 
 &amp; east is a fairly flat area of       
 intensive mainly arable farming,      
 whilst the north, along the river     
 valleys is more varied, with more     
 woodland a smaller fields, so is more 
 popular with visitors.   Thorn Park   
 drain acts as an overflow for the     
 river Derwent.   Primarily            
 agricultural the block still has large
 areas given over to recreation-as well
 as Forge Valley, Raincliffe Woods are 
 available for visitors use and are    
 quite heavily used, being so close to 
 Scarborough.   It is a popular area   
 for day trips because of the scenery, </content>
