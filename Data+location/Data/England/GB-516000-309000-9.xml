		<title>09DEEPING ST.JAMES VIDEOS</title>
		<content>  There are 4 kinds of video systems.  
 They are VHS,Betamax,Video 2000 and   
 VCR which is not made anymore.They    
 cost from around Â£400 to Â£650.You can 
 have remote control for your video.   
 Videos became more popular in recent  
 years as the price of going to the    
 cinema increased,and there were fewer 
 cinemas.People also like watching     
 films in the comfort of their own     
 home.                                 
  The video 2000 system is the first   
 video in which the video cassette can 
 be turned over.This gives a much      
 longer recording time for a given     
 length of tape ,but you need to be    
 there to turn the cassette over.      
  You can hire video tapes for any     
 length of time.If you hire a video    
 tape over night it would cost on      
 average between Â£1.00 and Â£1.50.
