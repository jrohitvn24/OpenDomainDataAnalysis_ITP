 joined in with the Birkdale Cricket   
 club,which was founded in 1874,to form
 the Southport and Birkdale Cricket    
 club.The Southport and Birkdale       
 Cricket club which is in Trafalgar    
 road Birkdale has various facilities  
 for people with different tastes.At   
 first it was a reasonably small club  
 but has since grown in stature.There  
 is cricket for people aged 10 to 18   
 (approximately).On Monday the youngest
 people attend,on Tuesday the next     
 youngest and so on.After the practice 
 the children are allowed to buy a     
 drink from the bar.There is also a    
 snooker room where only 18's  are     
 allowed to play unless the youngsters 
 are with an adult.You have to pay for 
 the lights which are 20 pence for an  
 hour and once the light goes out and  
 if someone is waiting you have to stop</content>
