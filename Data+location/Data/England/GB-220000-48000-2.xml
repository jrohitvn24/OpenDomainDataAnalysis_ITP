		<content>      Originally a thriving working    
 fishing harbour it is mainly used     
 by small boats and yachts for,and     
 by,holidaymakers.It is still used     
 commercially by two 'purse seine'     
 boats and some of the others do catch 
 mackerel by longline. Crabs and       
 lobsters are caught mainly for the    
 local restaraunts.Vast amounts of     
 pilchards were once caught and        
 processed but are rarely seen now. The
 harbour entrnce is very narrow and    
 dangerous in heavy seas and a huge    
 elecrically operated steel gate       
 protects the inner harbour, boats and 
 walls.
