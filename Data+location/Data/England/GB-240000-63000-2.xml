		<content>    Domestic life is of two kinds:     
 (1) The long established family, who  
 have been{farming}or market gardening 
 the same land for generations.{Life   
{styles}for these people are slow to   
 change, with the daily farming routine
 observed all the year round. Many     
 farms and cottages still rely on      
 spring water for their only supply,   
 but elecicity is available to all     
 properties, either through mains      
 supply or private generator. This has 
 made milking easier and also provided 
 television for occasional relaxation. 
{Communication}with the outside world  
 would be confined to weekly excursions
 to the nearest shops (some 6 or 8     
 miles). There is no public transport  
 here however.                         
{Attitudes}are contentedly parochial.  
 A broad westcountry dialect is spoken,
 and self-sufficiency is the the aim.  </content>
