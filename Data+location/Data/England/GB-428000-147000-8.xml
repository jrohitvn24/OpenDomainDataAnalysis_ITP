		<content> The last few years have seen a        
 continued retreat from the{church}as  
 the focal point of social and         
 religious life which it has occupied  
 for centuries.   There is still a     
 strong religious element in the life  
 of people but there is greater use    
 nowadays of more lowly centres of     
 interest, such as the village{public  
{house}and the retreat into private    
 homes to watch the nightly output of  
{television}programmes.   These have   
 changed the ideas and interests of    
 people to the extent that there is    
 less dependence on the church to      
 provide support and guidance.         
{Village halls}are regularly used as   
 community centres and financial help  
 is provided for them in the form of   
 grants from the local{Councils.
