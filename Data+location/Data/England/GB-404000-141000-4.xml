		<content>                                       
   The Blind House is situated         
 beside the River Till and the A360.   
  The building is an ancient monument  
 dating back to the eighteenth century.
 It is a small circular building with a
 domed roof and made of stone.         
  The Blind House has two small windows
 with iron bars, and a heavy wooden    
 door with an iron handle and hinges.  
  The Blind House was a lock-up where  
 village criminals were gaoled         
 temporarily before being either       
 released or hung at the Gibbet.       
  The lock-up was in use up until the  
 end of the nineteenth century.        
  Because of its position, on          
 dangerous road junction the Blind     
 House has been moved twice,but its    
 original appearance has been          
 maintained.
