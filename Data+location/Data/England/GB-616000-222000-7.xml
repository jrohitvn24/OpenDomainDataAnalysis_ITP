		<content> TODAY I ASKED PEOPLE IN CLASS 5 HOW   
 THEY TRAVEL TO SCHOOL. 11 PEOPLE{WALK 
 TO SCHOOL, 8 PEOPLE{CYCLE}TO SCHOOL   
 AND 7 PEOPLE COME IN A{CAR.}THE LEAST 
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE, 3, COME BY{BUS.     
                                       
 WE ALSO ASKED 30 PEOPLE, MAINLY       
 CHILDREN, HOW THEY WOULD TRAVEL TO    
 COLCHESTER. 14 CHILDREN AND OUR       
 TEACHER SAID THEY WOULD TRAVEL BY CAR 
 AND 11 PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULD GO BY   
 TRAIN.  BUS AND TAXI WERE NOT SO      
 POPULAR,PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH
 EXPENSIVE, BUT ONE PERSON USED EACH OF
 THESE METHODS. THE BUS COMPANY HAS    
 RECENTLY INTRODUCED A SPECIAL CHEAP   
 DAY RETURN TO COLCHESTER ON SATURDAYS,
 TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO USE THE   
 BUSES. SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, ONE PERSON
 SAID HE WOULD BIKE TO COLCHESTER. THE 
 TRAIN SERVICE TO COLCHESTER IS MUCH   
 BETTER THAN THE BUS SERVICE.          </content>
