		<content> Every four years an election of       
 councillors takes  place.{Tidbury     
{Green,}Cheswick Green and Hockley     
 Heath have a combined{Parish Council }
 which deals with local problems.The   
 Borough Council concerns itself with  
 Education, Social Services, Housing,  
 Planning Permission, Applications and 
 Public works including streets,       
 litter, speed restrictions etc:       
     Every householder pays rates to   
 the Council for projects like new     
 schools, roudabouts and roads etc.The 
 amount paid varies from each          
 household,it is based on the rateable 
 value of the property.Heavy lorries   
 travelling through Tidbury Green are  
 the main problem of concern at this   
 time because the present roads are not
 adequate.
