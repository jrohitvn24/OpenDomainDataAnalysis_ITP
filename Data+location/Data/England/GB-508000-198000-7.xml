		<content>We went to see Mr Lory who farms nearby
on Home Farm.  He said that his farm   
was 3000 acres stretching as far as    
Tring. It is a mixed farm.  The section
of farm in our area is 300 acres and   
rented from The Grove which is now     
owned by British Rail but was the house
which used to belong to the Earl of    
Clarendon. On this land he has a herd  
of Friesian cows. The milk is sent to  
the Milk Marketing Board. On this part 
of the farm at Christmas they raise    
turkeys that have been especially      
fattened.  The have a workforce of 14  
for all the farm, including 1          
secretary. There is a lot of machinery 
including tractors which can do the    
work of 20 men. The farmworkers like   
farming because it is outdoor work, a  
challenge and there is variety. Large  
or small farms can survive in 1985 if  
well planned.                          </content>
