The quality of life depends on use of a
car, public transport is inadequate.   
Nearest shops, doctor, dentist,        
hospital are in Buckingham.  Most young
families have 2 cars, own their own    
home and use the village as a "resting 
place", while the elderly and poor     
vegitate.  Much use is made of conven- 
ience foods full of chemicals, while   
skimmed milk, wholemeal bread, less    
sugar and salt show the trend towards  
healthier living - coupled with regular
exercise.  Among villagers there is a  
caring attitude for one another, but   
little community spirit.  This may be  
due to lack of a shop which is a great 
meeting place, or absence of modern    
village hall - one one used now is     
hardly more than a shed.
