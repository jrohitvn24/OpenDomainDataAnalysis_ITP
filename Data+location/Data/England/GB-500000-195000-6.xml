tennis, cricket and football. Football 
is played by the young of Chorleywood  
at Cubs, Schools and various clubs. The
football pitch used by most boys is    
"The Swillet". Cricket is also played  
both by children and adults. There is  
a club which plays on the Common and   
which is divided into ages.            
Tennis is also played by both children 
and adults. There are several clubs in 
Chorleywood, public and private. A     
private club is situated in the grounds
of Chorleywood House -as well as public
courts. Golf is also played on the     
common. Swimming is also popular       
especially among the young though you  
have to be keen because you have to go 
out of Chorleywood to find a public    
swimming pool. The most popular is at  
Amersham but quite a lot of people go  
to William Penn School.                </content>
