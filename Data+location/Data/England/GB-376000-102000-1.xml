		<content> The area is country, with narrow lanes
 meandering through hills and dales,   
 with many wooded area, and numerous   
 streams running through quaint        
 villages with thatched cottages built 
 of stone, brick and flint (and some of
 cob). The major feature in the area is
 Milton Abbey and School. The          
 population consists mainly of         
 agricultural, retired and commuters.  
 It is rather sad that so many         
 properties are holiday dwellings      
 although there are still people in    
 their 80's who have lied here all     
 there lives.  The main night life is  
 centred on the Fox at Ansty, but there
 is also a community centre at Ansty,  
 converted from what was the old       
 brewery, where a vilage pantomine is  
 produced each year and where there    
 is a thriving lunch club and evening  
 club twice a month for the over 60's. </content>
