		<title>08Merdon Castle (1)</title>
		<content>   The origins of Merdon Castle lay in 
 an iron age hill fort dating from     
 about 100BC . The fort was not        
 strategically well-placed and may have
 been a hideout within the forest .    
 Later there may have been a Roman     
 Settlement here . The Saxons built a  
 wooden fort within the outer rampart  
 of earthworks in about 500AD .        
 Although little is known of this fort,
 King Cynewulf of the West Saxons was  
 murdered here in 757AD , and Ethelred 
 and Alfred were defeated by the Danes 
 in a battle at Merdon in 871AD .      
  In 1138 at the time of the Stephen   
 and Matilda wars Bishop Henry de      
 Blois , of Winchester , built a stone 
 castle also within the earthworks .   
 Bishop Henry was Stephen's half       
 brother . Still its stategic purpose  
 was not clear and for 300 years it was
 used as a palace , mainly for hunting.</content>
