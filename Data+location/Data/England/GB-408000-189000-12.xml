		<title>12READING ROOM, PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content>  A successful community project was   
 the building of the{reading room}at   
 the entrance to the village in        
 1909.This was achieved largely due to 
 efforts of Miss Warrender of Purton   
 Stoke House Contributions came in from
 various friends amounting to Â£250.    
  The building was used for a meeting  
 place, as a dance hall, a youth club  
 and on Sundays for services.          
  In 1973 it was sold to Mr.E.Clark.   
 Three people were picked by the       
 village to look after the money from  
 the sale.
