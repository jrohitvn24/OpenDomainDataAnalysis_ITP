		<content> FROME is  a market town in Somerset.  
 It is the fourth largest town in Somer
 set &amp; was founded in 685 by St.       
 Aldhelm. It has grown a lot since then
 and is now the 4th. largest town in   
 Somerset with about 20,000  people.   
 The industry in Frome used to be      
 cloth making but now that has been    
 replaced by light engineering, carpet 
 making, printing and others.  In 1985 
 we celebrate Frome 1300 with many     
 events. Frome has a weekly market, but
 the Council has plans to move it away 
 from the town centre.  There are      
 market stalls in the Market Place     
 every Wednesday &amp; Saturday.  Frome is 
 twinned with Murrhardt in Germany and 
 Chateau Gontier in France. The oldest 
 part of Frome is medieval Cheap St. &amp; 
 the Trinity area (1670- l720) with 6  
 streets of houses is interesting.
