		<content> The area is predominately chalkland   
 rising to the ridge along Inkpen      
 Beacon.woodlands,fields of corn and   
 fine herds of cattle are to be seen in
 the south of Hungerford.              
                                       
 Private developement side by side with
 local authority housing has spread    
 southwards since 1945 over former     
 agricultural and horticultural land.  
 the southern extremity of the town for
 the foreseeable future has now been   
 established by the planting of a tree 
 belt of deciduous trees.              
                                       
 The road pattern is basically rural   
 with the exception of the A338 which  
 links from Oxford,through Salisbury to
 the South Coast. The area is          
 honeycombed with public footpaths and 
 bridle ways,some of which date back   
 from medieval times.                  </content>
