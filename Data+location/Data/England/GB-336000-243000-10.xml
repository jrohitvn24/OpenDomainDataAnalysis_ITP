		<content> HOUSING IN STAUNTON ON WYE            
 Most houses in Staunton are owner-    
 occupied but there is some rented     
 property and 14 council houses in the 
 centre of the village. In Mansell     
 Gamage and Byford many houses are     
 owned by Garnons and occupied by      
 estate workers or their widows while  
 others have been recently sold off the
 estate. There has been little new     
 building in Staunton over the last few
 years. Many of the houses are half    
 timbered, 17th century or earlier.    
 In Staunton are Orchard Cottage, a    
 welsh long house, rare in this area   
 andThe Ridge, the only thatched       
 cottage. Many of the Garnons Estate   
 houses are Victorian. Mansell Gamage  
 church has been turned into an unusual
 dwelling by the owner, Nicholas       
 Bulmer.
