		<content> Mrs.Wray was Mayor of S.Wigston and   
 she keeps a shop on the Blaby Rd.When 
 she was Mayor she went to a Garden    
 Party at Buckingham Palace.She told us
 about the Coat of Arms of S.Wigston.  
 The railway line has always been very 
 important here and the first houses   
 were built in Station St.There was a  
 level crossing where the park is now. 
 The prosperity brought by the railway 
 line is shown by two pairs of narrow  
 horizontal stripes in gold on the     
 badge.There are tigers on the badge   
 representing the Leicestershire Regt. 
 which used to be at Glen Parva        
 Barracks.The owl at the top of the    
 badge represents wisdom,it also       
 stands for Oadby,Wigston,Leicester.   
 Mrs.Wray has lived in S.Wigston since 
 1921,and her shop has been there for  
 64 yrs.{(By Parklands School children)
