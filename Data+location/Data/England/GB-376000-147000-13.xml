		<content>{Playground:}The most popular game is  
 overline. Someone on it and the names 
 get shouted out for them to and run   
 across the playground. If stampede is 
 called, everybody runs. If anyone     
 is called and doesn't get across the  
 playground without being touched, they
 are on it. Elastics is another game   
 with girls.  This is played with a    
 piece of elastic which has to be      
 jumped over without touching.         
{On grass:}We play football, rounders, 
 cricket, leapfrog, and in season,     
 conkers.                              
{At home:}We play computer games &amp;     
 Monopoly.  Girls play with Sindy - a  
 grown up doll with lots of clothes &amp;  
 equipment &amp; boys have their action    
 man dolls too. Lego building bricks   
 are used a lot.
