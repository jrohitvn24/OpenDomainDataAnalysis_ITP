		<title>01THE LOCATION OF WENT HILLS.</title>
		<content>     We chose to call the area we were 
 given{"Went Hills"}because the Went   
 Hills go across the area which really 
 can be split into three different     
 parts,{Wentbridge, Darrington}and     
{Stapleton.}                           
   Our survey covered the eastern part 
 of Darrington,for which census        
 information is available. Stapleton   
 and Wentbridge are both divided by    
 County and Census boundries, and it   
 was not possible to obtain accurate   
 figures for either place.{
