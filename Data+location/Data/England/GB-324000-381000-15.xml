		<title>15LADYMOUNT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Ladymount school is built like a      
 honeycomb because it is hexagonal in  
 shape. All the classrooms are         
 hexagonal and there are lots of little
 corners.  We have three infant classes
 and four Junior classes and we now    
 have a pre-school group which only    
 takes place on three mornings per     
 week. Our classrooms have rectangular 
 and hexagonal tables, and we sit in   
 groups of four or six. We keep all our
 books and pencils in a tray which we  
 store in a special unit with ledges to
 fit the trays. We decorate the walls  
 with colourful collages. We did one of
 the beach and one of Springtime. We   
 have charts about the weather and     
 various charts to do with maths.
