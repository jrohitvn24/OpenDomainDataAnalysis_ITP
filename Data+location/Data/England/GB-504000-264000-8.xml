		<title>08Church Services, Swineshead</title>
		<content> Church services in Swineshead are     
 conducted by the vicar, who lives at  
 Dean. He is assisted by the Deaconess 
 who lives at Pertenhall. They both    
 also serve the surrounding 5 Parishes 
 of Dean, Shelton, Yelden, Melchbourne 
 and Pertenhall.                       
 Some of the services in Swineshead are
 conducted by two other vicars. There  
 are two church wardens at the present 
 time.                                 
 The family service comes to Swineshead
 once every six weeks and people from  
 the other 5 Parishes, gather together 
 at St. Nicholas. The young children   
 are welcome and a rug and a box of    
 toys are provided for them at the back
 of the church.
