		<title>04Terraced Houses in Birdwell.</title>
		<content> Thee are many terraced houses in      
 Birdwell especially along the main    
 road.Some of these have recently been 
 rebuilt because subsidence and old age
 had made them dangerous.              
                                       
 The brickwork on these houses is often
 poor through age.These houses have six
 rooms.Downstairs there is a kitchen,a 
 dining room,and a living room.Upstairs
 are two bedrooms and a bathroom.      
                                       
 There are six to ten houses in each   
 terraced row.The terraced row is the  
 most obvious type of housing          
 development in Birdwell. Infact       
 semi-detaced houses and bungalows are 
 more numerous now,but these are       
 largely on estates hidden from the    
 main road.
