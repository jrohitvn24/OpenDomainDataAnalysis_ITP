		<content>  Forty years ago the only sources of  
 energy in the village were coal, wood,
 oil and bottled gas . Today most      
 houses have electricity although there
 are no gas mains in the village. Piped
 water and mains drainage are now      
 available to most homes.              
  Housholds now have number of labour  
 saving devices such as Washing        
 Machines,Tumble Driers. Dishwashers   
 are becoming commonplace.             
  There is no street lighting.         
  On several occasions snow storms     
 have isolated the village and brought 
 down electricity power cables for up  
 to a week. Thus the old sources of    
 energy are still the best and most    
 reliable and most homes are still     
 equiped to use them.
