 Goodwood house was originally built   
 in 1616. It was a hunting lodge. The  
 house was bought by the first Duke of 
 Richmond in 1694 and has been the home
 of all Dukes since.                   
 There is a fascinating collection of  
 family portraits dating from King     
 Charles. They show the changing of    
 fashion and the continuing family     
 likenesses. There are woven tapestries
 ordered by the King of France. There  
 are loveley bird and flower paintings 
 on a collection of porcelain by Serves
 beautifully displayed. There are many 
 objects once owned by famous people.  
 The plate Napoleon used at breakfast  
 on the morning of the Battle of       
 Waterloo and the emerald given by King
 Charles 11 to the mother of the first 
 Duke of Richmond.
