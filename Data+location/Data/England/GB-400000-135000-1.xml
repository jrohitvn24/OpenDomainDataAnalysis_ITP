		<title>01Wylye and the Langfords</title>
		<content> Our D Block is full of fields with    
 rough grazing and crops and in between
 the hills there is the River Wylye and
 then there are two villages, Wylye and
 Langford and the population of Wylye  
 is 250 and of Langfords is about 400. 
 There are lots of different types of  
 houses. There are brick and flint and 
 thatched and tiled roofs and there are
 old cottages and new houses. There are
 quite a lot of jobs about the village 
 because there is cleaning the river   
 and shop keeping and farms to work on 
 and domestic work and then after a    
 hard days work there are lots of nice 
 walks over the lovely countryside.
