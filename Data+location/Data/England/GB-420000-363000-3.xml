		<title>03THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Youlgrave church was built in Norman  
 times. The tall broad tower is one of 
 the most impressive in Derbyshire. The
 font is the only one in England with a
 stoup attached to its side (there is a
 replica at Elton nearby). The lady    
 chapel at the north is dedicated to   
 King Charles the Martyr. The chancel  
 contains the tomb of Sir Thomas       
 Cockayne. Thomas Cockayne died before 
 his father, that's why his tomb is    
 smaller than it should be. A carving  
 of a knight with his heart in his hand
 covers the tomb of a knight who       
 supposedly carried the heart of Robert
 the Bruce to the Holy Land. There is a
 peal of eight bells, the heaviest of  
 which weighs well over a ton. The     
 stained glass window at the east was  
 designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.   
 Other windows are by Charles Kempe.
