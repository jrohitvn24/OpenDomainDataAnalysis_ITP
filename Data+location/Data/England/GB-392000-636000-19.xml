		<content>       FORD PARISH CHURCH              
   From the porch of this ancient      
 church parishioners have,for eight    
 hundred years,enjoyed the view across 
 the valley floor to the heights of the
 Cheviot Hills.Here are the tombstones 
 of their forbears and near the door   
 those of Lady Waterford and the first 
 Lord Joicey,two of their most notable 
 benefactors.                          
   The gloom of the interior is        
 relieved by light from several stained
 glass windows with one depicting its  
 patron saint, St.Michael,slaying the  
 dragon.                               
   The stone pulpit was installed to   
 mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. 
 Its surrounding statuettes show some  
 of the apostles.                      
   There are 50 pews which provide     
 seating for 300 people.
