		<title>12EAST LEAKE LEISURE CENTRE</title>
		<content> The leisure centre forms part of the  
 Harry Carlton Comprehensive School and
 is used jointly by school and public. 
 The Nottinghamsire Authority pioneered
 the building of leisure centres at    
 schools to be used by children and    
 adults.                               
 The centre has a large hall,used for  
 badminton,indoor football etc.,good   
 changing rooms with showers and a     
 licenced bar.                         
 It is one of the smaller centres in   
 the county and unfortunately there is 
 no swimming pool.                     
 During school term-time the centre is 
 used exclusively by the school for    
 Physical Education lessons until 4.30 
 p.m.                                  
 The large hall is often used for      
 dancing and concerts.
