		<title>10Toppesfield Stores</title>
		<content> Toppesfield Stores was originally     
 built as a farmhouse about 1680 and is
 protected as a Grade II "listed"      
 building.Although now a general store,
 it was once used as a bakery and      
 previously as a butcher'shop.The      
 village once had two other shops but  
 these have long since closed. Mr.&amp;    
 Mrs.Shannon,the present owners, have  
 been there for 20 years.When they     
 first came,the shop was extensively   
 used by local people and the many     
 farm workers who were employed pea and
 potato picking.Now the shop is mainly 
 used for convenience shopping because 
 most families have cars and go to     
 supermarkets in nearby towns for their
 main food needs. Mr.Shannon has long  
 been interested in old furniture and  
 has developed his hobby into an exten_
 sion of the business so that part of  
 the shop is now used for antique sales</content>
