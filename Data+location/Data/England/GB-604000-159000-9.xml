		<title>09OPINION POLL OF BOUGHTON</title>
		<content>   Boughton is a nice place to live in 
 with a nice atmosphere.After working  
 in London or abroad, it is very       
 relaxing to come back to a            
 friendly village. I would like to see 
 parking on only one side of the street
 and possibly a fish and chip shop.    
   {Stanley Lebor}                     
  Boughton is expanding in terms of    
 housing but the facilities are not    
 keeping up with it. The village needs 
 a bank, bakers and a chemist.It would 
 also be an advantage driving wise to  
 have restricted parking on one side of
 the Street.                           
{  Susan Bing}                         
  This village is a happy compromise   
 between a town and a village. It has  
 more going for it than a village but  
 is not as busy and noisy as a town.
