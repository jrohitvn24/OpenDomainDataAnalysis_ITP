		<title>01South East Guildford</title>
		<content> Our area consists of S.E. Guildford,  
 N.E. Shalford, Chilworth, Merrow Downs
 and Pewley Down. Part of the Pilgrims'
 Way passes through the area. The      
 majority of the land is farmland and  
 open grass land but it also includes  
 deciduous woodland. The soil is not   
 very suitable for arable farming and  
 the main agricultural activity is     
 livestock rearing. There are many     
 streams in the South but very few on  
 the chalk downs in the north because  
 chalk is porous.                      
                                       
 There is much local history in the    
 area, especially in the village of    
 Chilworth. On the whole there is a    
 good community atmosphere. In the     
 villages people are very friendly.    
 Most people are happy living there    
 because the amenities of Guildford are
 good and the countryside is near.     </content>
