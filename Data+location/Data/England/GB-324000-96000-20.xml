		<content> There is not a lot of employment      
 available in this area, because there 
 are not many industries.   However,   
 there are several farms in our area   
 which provide work for some people.   
 In the nearby town of Axminster there 
 are two main employers; the carpet    
 factory, which is world-famous, and   
 Shands.                               
 Axminster Carpet Factory makes good   
 quality carpets which are sent all    
 over the country and exported,too.    
 Shands Factory makes print for        
 typewriters, computers, cash          
 registers, credit and identity cards. 
 There is also work in shops and       
 offices, of course, and there is quite
 a lot of seasonal work available in   
 the summer because of the influx of   
 holiday-makers.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
