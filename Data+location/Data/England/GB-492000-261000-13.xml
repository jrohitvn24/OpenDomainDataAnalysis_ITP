		<content>   The area lacks the facilities of the
 urban areas, but there are still a    
 wide range of leisure activities.     
   Gardening is the favourite activity 
 and this interest is extended in the  
 allotments near the school.           
   Many of the pastimes that the people
 mentioned, such as knitting, sewing,  
 D.I.Y. cooking, bridge, scrabble,     
 crosswords, painting and craftwork,   
 can be enjoyed within the home.  There
 is ample opportunity for the outdoor  
 activities such as riding, walking,   
 shooting, hunting, ornithology and    
 naturalist interests.  In the summer  
 the village fields a cricket team.    
 Activities such as tennis, golf, Inner
 Wheel and Rotary Clubs, swimming,     
 opera, ballet and the theatre involve 
 travelling to urban areas.  There is  
 an active W.I.  There are no pubs, but
 there are two licensed clubs.         </content>
