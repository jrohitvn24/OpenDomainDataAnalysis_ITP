		<content> When you leave school the most        
 difficult thing is getting a job      
 today because of the country's        
{unemployment problem.} Some of the    
 people who are lucky enough to get    
 jobs are usually paid the average sum 
 of roughly Â£25 per day, but those     
 unemployed are on the{dole}and get    
 less.  If you do not get enough money 
 from your job there is{Social         
{Security.} The main employment is     
{farming and forestry.}In the villages 
 here there are jobs like shopkeeping, 
 building, taxi driving bed &amp; breakfast
 work.  People go out of the area to   
 work to Bodmin, people like teachers, 
 lawyers,shop keepers and hospital     
 workers. When I leave home I hope to  
 be a policeman.  I don't particulary  
 want to leave the area but I will if I
 have to.
