		<content>   Lovington Church is one of six      
 parish churches in the Benefice of    
 the Six Pilgrims.                     
   Dating from around 1300 and         
 dedicated to St.Thomas a Becket,it    
 was restored in 1861 when the aisle   
 was added.The heavily buttressed tower
 remains from the medieval church also 
 some unique stone carving above the   
 aumbry or cupboard where the sacred   
 vessels were kept.In the chancel too  
 is the original piscina which received
 the water used to wash the vessels for
 the Holy Sacrament.                   
   All six parishes in the Benefice lie
 on or near the road to Glastonbury    
 that pilgrims would have taken when   
 they visited the Abbey centuries ago. 
   Alford,Hornblotton,Lovington,North  
 and South Barrow and Babcary are all  
 administered by one vicar.
