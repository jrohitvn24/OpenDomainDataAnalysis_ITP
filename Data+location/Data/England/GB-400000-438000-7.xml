		<title>07LOCAL CRIME IN '85</title>
		<content>    A local widow, aged 76 years kept  
 two robbers at bay when they recently 
 broke into her flat.She threatened    
 them with her bedside lamp and told   
 them that her husband would soon be   
 arriving home.The robbers wanted to   
 know where she kept all her money  but
 the 76 year old wonder woman would not
 tell them. Eventually the robbers left
 taking with them her handbag which    
 contained Â£30 and some bank books.    
   Both of the men wore jackets over   
 their heads and broke in through the  
 bathroom window. Another robbery in   
 which Â£200 was stolen could have been 
 carried out by the same robbers.      
   This type of crime particularly     
 involving older people appears to be  
 coming more commonplace in the 1980's 
 and there is growing concern about the
 increased use of violence against the 
 elderly.                              </content>
