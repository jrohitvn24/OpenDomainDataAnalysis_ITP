		<title>15The Mayor of Sandwich</title>
		<content>The present Mayor,Mr.R.R.Chesterfield  
has been Mayor three times in 1972,1973
and 1985.When Sandwich changed from a  
borough to a town he had less authority
over planning and travelled less in a  
smaller area.The town of Sandwich owns 
alot of regalia used by the mayor which
includes three silver-gilt maces(the   
two smaller ones were made in 1435.    
In 1457 some French from Honfleur      
invaded Sandwich and the Mayor was     
killed.Now Honfleur is Sandwich's twin 
town.                                  
The Mayor attends civic functions in   
the town and he is the President of    
many organisations.He visits people of 
the town:the old,sick and young.He     
attends three major Church services    
each year on Mayor's Sunday,Battle of  
Britain Sunday and Armistice Sunday.He 
has a personal chaplain to deal with   
his spiritual needs.                   </content>
