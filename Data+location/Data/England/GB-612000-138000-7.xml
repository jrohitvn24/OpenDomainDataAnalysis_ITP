		<content> The area is very poor in amenities of 
 any kind. There are four foot paths   
 and the Pilgrim's Way which cross the 
 east of Monks Horton and the north of 
 Postling,and the North Downs Way which
 runs along the high ground. The former
 are walked at intervals by the        
 Sellindge Footpaths Association,and   
 the latter by hikers from farther     
 afield. Farthing Common is used as a  
 picnic halt in the summer by motorists
 travelling along Stone Street. An old 
 chalk pit on the drop from the Downs  
 at Hempton Hill provides a temporary  
 mini-circuit for young motor-cyclists.
 There is a small site at Page Farm,   
 Postling for touring caravans run in  
 association with the Caravan Club.
