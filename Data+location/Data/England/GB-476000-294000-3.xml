		<title>03HALLATON FARMS AND HOUSES</title>
		<content>  Much of the area we are covering is  
 rich agricultural land. The farms are 
 mostly mixed: cereal, sheep or cattle.
 There is a milk herd of cows in       
 Hallaton and cattle dealers. Some of  
 the land is owned by the Brudenells of
 Deane Park (near Corby), some by      
 Cambridge colleges and there are a few
 independent landowners. There is also 
 some Glebe land in Hallaton.          
  The milk herd in Hallaton supplies   
 much of the surrounding area with raw 
 unpasteurised milk. The milk is bott- 
 led on the farm and delivered daily.  
  As well as the farms in the centre of
 the village, there are many types of  
 houses. These include restored period 
 properties - many thatched, two rows  
 of council houses, 15 charity         
 cottages, other privately rented      
 cottages, and new large executive     
 houses built on infill sites.         </content>
