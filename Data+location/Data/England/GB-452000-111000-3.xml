		<content>    The Reading Room in Curdridge is   
 the same as a Village Hall except that
 it is owned and run by the village and
 not by the County Council.            
    The Reading Room Management        
 Committee are a group of people who   
 live in Curdridge.  Some represent the
 Parish Council, and others represent  
 the users of the Reading Room -       
 Fairlands School, the Drama Group,    
 W.I., Curdridge Youth Group, Floral   
 Club, Luncheon Club, Local History    
 Society and the Friendship Club.      
    Apart from the main committee      
 there are three others, the House     
 Committee, the Grounds Committee and  
 the Entertainments Committee, which is
 responsible for raising money incase  
 some major catastrophe happened, and  
 the Reading Room Funds were not enough
 to pay for the damage.                
    The Reading Room was built in 1884.</content>
