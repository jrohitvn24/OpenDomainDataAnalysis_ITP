		<content>{Self-employed}persons in the area are 
 chiefly farmers, most of whom have    
 family as work force and employ casual
 seasonal labour.{Local employment}is  
 from farms, potato merchant, landscape
 gardener and riding stables. Poultry- 
 rearing units in Faceby closed        
 recently with a loss of 14 jobs; of   
 their disused buildings designated for
 light industry, one is occupied by a  
 woodworker making settee frames, and  
 another has planning approval for     
 auto-repair work.{Commuters,}mainly to
 Teesside, include garage owners,      
 architect, accountant, chemist, baker,
 builder,plant hirer,shopfitter,painter
 and decorator, and industrial workers.
 In many families both partners have   
 whole or part-time jobs. For{school-  
{leavers}there is nothing locally      
 though a riding stable gives holiday  
 and weekend work for a few youngsters.</content>
