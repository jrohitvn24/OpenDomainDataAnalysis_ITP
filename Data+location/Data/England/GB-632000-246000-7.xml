		<content> All organised entertainment in this   
 area is confined to the USAF Air Base,
 RAF Woodbridge. There are various     
 social group activities, including a  
 club for wives, a Youth Centre to en- 
 courage constructive pastimes for     
 young people, and an Arts and Crafts  
 Centre including a theatre group which
 performs for local hospitals. Various 
 functions are organised throughout the
 year on American holidays such as     
 Independence Day on 4 July when there 
 is a picnic and fireworks display, as 
 well as the usual Christmas and New   
 Year festivities. The local population
 eagerly support events at Sutton      
 Village Hall including cricket, bingo,
 and Country &amp; Western dances. For a   
 special occasion they may travel to   
 Ipswich, Felistowe, or further afield 
 to concerts, theatre, cinema, or to   
 dine out.                             </content>
