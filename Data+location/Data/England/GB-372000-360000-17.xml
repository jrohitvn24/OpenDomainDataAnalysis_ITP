    In the area covered by this block  
 i.e Elworth and part of Sandbach there
 are four primary schools.The four     
 being:Elworth Church of England County
 Primary,Elworth Hall County Primary,  
 Sandbach County Primary and,finally,  
 Offley County Infant and Primary.The  
 last of the four being split between  
 two buildings but on the same site.   
     All the four schools cater for the
 full primary age range i.e. from five 
 to eleven years of age.At eleven the  
 children move on to the two           
 comprehensive schools in the area i.e.
 Sandbach High School (girls only) and 
 Sandbach School (boys only).          
     Prior to five years of age most of
 the children attend some kind of      
 playgroup or play school.In this area 
 there is no state nursery education at
 the present time.                     </content>
