		<title>07Gt.Bromley:Likes + Dislikes.</title>
		<content> In our survey,we asked what people    
 liked about living here.The most      
 common likes were:open space;the      
 pretty{countryside}and the peace and  
 quiet.Others commented on the         
{friendliness}and strong community     
 feeling and easy access to major      
 towns.                                
  We also asked what people disliked   
 most about living in the area.The     
 commonest{grumbles}were:lack of       
 local facilities,especially shops;the 
 lack of entertainment(mainly for      
 youngsters)and the{poor public}       
{transport}.Some felt the village was  
 rather isolated in winter and a few   
 remarked on the lack of privacy.      
  People obviously appreciate the      
 benefits of living in the countryside 
 but don't want to lose the facilities 
 of the town.
