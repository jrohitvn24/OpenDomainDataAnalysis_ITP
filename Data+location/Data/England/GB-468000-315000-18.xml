		<title>18A walk around Frisby</title>
		<content> Standing at the market or preaching   
 cross,built in the 13th. century and  
 moved from the middle of the road a   
 few years ago,you can see Georgian    
 Cottage built in 1767, which has an   
 old water pump outside.Further along  
 Rotherby Lane is the Old Institute and
 Zion House,a thatched cottage which   
 has the date 1725 on the gable end.The
 Old Institute was used during World   
 War Two as a Home Guard meeting       
 place.Off Main St.and opposite Hollow 
 Lane is Skinner's Yard where there was
 a butchers shop and slaughter house   
 until 1973.At the end of Hollow Lane  
 Glebe Cottage,timber framed and       
 thatched, stands adjacent to the old  
 vicarage,which dates in some parts    
 from medieval times.Follow Carrfields 
 Lane and Mill Lane to the Old Mill    
 House where you can still see the     
 millrace.The walk takes about 40 mins.</content>
