		<content> Some shops and services have remained 
 since 1905. They include: the         
 newsagent, the Lion Hotel and Public  
 House, post office and butcher. Some  
 shops and services have changed this  
 century they include Wilson's shoe    
 shop, the coal merchant, Buckley's    
 cakery, drapery, crockery and grocery 
 store, Darlington's bakehouse,        
 Bootmaker, cycle agent, tailor,       
 grocery, milliner, Beresford's        
 confectioners and Beresford's cottage 
 grocery.                              
 In Moulton today there are fewer shops
 which include the Co_op, Post Office, 
 Newsagents, Greengrocer, DIY, Whally's
 General Store, Moulton Store and      
 Harrinson's clothes shop.             
 There is no longer a tailor but there 
 is a clothing factory which makes     
 clothes and sells to shops.
