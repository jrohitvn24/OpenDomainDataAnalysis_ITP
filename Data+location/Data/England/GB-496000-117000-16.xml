		<title>16 - CHURCHES IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>  This was once upon a time a very     
 important part of the local scene but 
 like agriculture, has become less and 
 less important.                       
  All Saints is the parish church of   
 Duncton and was built in 1868. It has 
 one of the oldest inscribed bells in  
 England, dating from 1369 and still   
 rings in the belltower.In the         
 churchyard is a memorial to Robert de 
 Grenier de Fanblanque whose wife once 
 led a suffragette march from Edinburgh
 to London in 1912.The rector is the   
 Rev.Alan Bucknell of Tillington and   
 services are held at 6:30 pm on       
 Sundays.                              
  The Roman Catholic church at Duncton 
 is dedicated to St. Anthony and St.   
 George and was also built in 1868.    
  The priest is Father Henry Hill who  
 lives in Angel Street, Petworth.      
 Masses are held at 8:30 am on Sundays.</content>
