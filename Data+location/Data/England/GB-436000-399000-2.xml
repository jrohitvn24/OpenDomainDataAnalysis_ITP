		<content> The area is central to large towns and
 cities: Barnsley, Rotherham, Doncaster
 and Sheffield. It is also close to the
{National Park}:the Peak District and  
 also the Pennines.                    
   An interview of people in Hoyland   
 town centre revealed that older people
 liked the shopping centre and market  
 and the fact that it is near the M1   
 motorway so they can easily get to    
 other places. People complained about 
 the bad roads and pavements and that  
 there were no good bus shelters. Young
 people like the sports centre and     
 Youth Clubs while the older people    
 liked the Bingo, pubs and churches.   
   The motorway ,the M1 runs to the    
 west of Hoyland making communication  
 to the rest of the country easy.
