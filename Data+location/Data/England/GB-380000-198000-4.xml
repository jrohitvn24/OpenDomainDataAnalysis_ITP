		<title>04Upper Lutheredge Family Farm</title>
		<content>   The family have been farmers since  
 1944. The owner has no intention of   
 selling the farm.If he had sold the   
 farm a year ago he would have received
 Â£2000 per acre.If he sold it today he 
 would get Â£1500 per acre.The farm is  
 as it was originally,and since he     
 wishes to continue farming,this does  
 not bother him.                       
   The farmer's son manages the farm.  
 He also manages Lower Lutheredge Farm,
 which has 50 acres of grassland and   
 300 acres of grain, and Woodcock Farm 
 which has 180 acres of grassland.     
 Two hired hands are also employed.    
   The farmer has 3 tractors and a     
 sprayer.They also have a grain dryer  
 which spins and dries the grain.      
   If he was to buy a new combine      
 harvester for his work next year,it   
 would cost him about Â£50,000.A new    
 tractor would cost him about Â£20,000. </content>
