		<title>05Farming in mid-Norfolk</title>
		<content> The area around Salhouse, Rackheath   
 and Little Plumstead is typical       
 Norfolk farmland with large open      
 fields taking advantage of the        
 flatness of the land.Trees are often  
 seen growing around the edges of the  
 fields acting as a screen to protect  
 the fields from{soil erosion}from the 
 bitter north-easterly wind which blows
 from late autumn to the early summer. 
 In some areas natural hedges have been
 left to grow by more conservation     
 minded farmers.                       
 Crops grown include{cereals}such as   
{wheat}and{barley.Sugar beet}and{peas} 
 are also grown.When harvested sugar   
 beet keeps factories at Cantley near  
 Gt Yarmouth and at King's Lynn working
 24 hrs a day.{Animal husbandry}is less
 important than crop growing but{sheep,
{cattle}and{pigs}can still be seen.It  
 was wool which once made Norfolk rich.</content>
