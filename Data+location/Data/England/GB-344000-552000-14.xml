		<content>   The River Eden flows past Wetheral. 
 Because it has always been one of the 
 great salmon rivers of Britain and    
 because this is a very good stretch of
 water the Eden has been important in  
 the growth of the Crown Hotel.At the  
 abbey nearby monks controlled all the 
 salmon fishing on the River Eden for  
 many hundreds of years.               
   300 years ago the Crown was a farm  
 but even then, so many many fishermen 
 stayed there that it was more         
 profitable to turn it into an hotel.  
   The fishermen had a special room    
 where they could talk and re-tell     
 their fishy stories. there was also a 
 room in which they could store their  
 tackle and clean the fish.Even after  
 extensive modernation the modern Crown
 Hotel has retained a room which is    
 called the Fish Room.
