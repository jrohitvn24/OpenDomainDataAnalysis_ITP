		<title>01Main Features of our Area</title>
		<content> The area is rural, made up of two     
 villages: Gt.Maplestead and Wickham   
 St.Paul and including parts of two    
 bordering villages Lt.Maplestead and  
 Gestingthorpe. The only remaining     
 village school is in Gt.Maplestead.   
 Houses are mixed in character and     
 ages. There are many timber framed    
 houses, some thatched. More modern    
 properties blend well with the rural  
 appearance and atmosphere of the      
 villages. The population of Wickham   
 St.Paul is 271, that of Gt.Maplestead 
 is 317.Two churches are in the area:  
 St.Giles in Gt.Maplestead and         
 St.John's in Lt.Maplestead. The main  
 crops grown are wheat, barley, sugar  
 beet and oil seed rape. Some cattle   
 and sheep are kept and partridges and 
 pheasants are bred for shooting.
