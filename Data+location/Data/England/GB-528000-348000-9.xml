		<content>          While half of the people in  
 our area work in the county the other 
 half travel into the town for         
 employment,it is too far to go into a 
 city.The majority of these people like
 their work but a few find it boring.  
        Very few peoples work has yet  
 been affected by the use of computers 
 and continues to be mainly manual with
 the aid of special machinery.         
        Most families have somebody    
 unemployed,the women go out to work in
 their families.Some of the people go  
 out to work in the night as well as   
 the day,but most of the women only    
 work in the day.A lot of people use   
 their hands in their work all the year
 round.Most farmworkers in this area   
 use special machinery and are not on  
 piece work although some were before  
 they changed jobs.A lot of peoples    
 work is in the immediate area.        </content>
