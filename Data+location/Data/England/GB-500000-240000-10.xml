		<title>10STEWARTBY: CHILDRENS VIEWS</title>
		<content> Written by Lorraine Percival aged 14  
 I asked my dad a number of questions  
 about what he thought of Stewartby,   
 for he lives and works there. He said 
 that he enjoyed living there because  
 it is very quiet. He also found it    
 handy to live in the village because  
 of his work. It has a very good bus   
 service to Bedford and the surrounding
 villages.                             
 His occupation is a burner; he works  
 on top of a kiln and controls the     
 burning of the bricks. He said it is  
 quite an interesting job to do. There 
 are some activities for the workers   
 like bowling, golf, and squash. The   
 local beauty spot is the quarry lake  
 and many workers take their families  
 here. A lot of sailing and speed boat 
 racing goes on there, especially on   
 Sundays. When it is not, people come  
 to see the lake and bring their dogs  </content>
