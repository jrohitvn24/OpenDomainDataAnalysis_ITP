		<title>18PAROCHIAL CHURCH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Secretary to the P.C.C. talked to 
 us about her work. There was no P.C.C.
 before 1914. The Church was run by the
 rich people or the Lord of the        
 Manor. Now the members are elected by 
 the village. They have to look after  
 the church buildings, the vicar's     
 robes, everything inside the          
 church.They have to pay the bills for 
 electricity, damage repairs, maintain 
 the organ and piano and buy candles.  
 They get the money from donations,    
 wills and collections at swrvices. The
 latest expense was for a new central  
 heating system and we went down from  
 school to see it being put in and to  
 see the new electric boiler.          
 The P.C.C. has to appoint a Captain of
 Bells who arranges the practices and  
 makes sure the bells are pealed on    
 Sunday. Some of the school children   
 are learning to ring.                 </content>
