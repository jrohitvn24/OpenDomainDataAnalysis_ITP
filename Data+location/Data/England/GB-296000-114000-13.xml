		<content>   We interviewed a lady who had lived 
 in the area all her life. She said    
 that she would not change anything but
 that she did miss the buses. There    
 used to be three buses a fortnight,   
 one on Tuesday for Market Day in      
 Tiverton and one every other Saturday.
 She said that everybody was dependant 
 on cars these days.                   
   The lady's husband is a retired farm
 worker and the two of them used to    
 meet up with most people from around  
 the area at Church functions. She said
 that there are some younger families  
 who have moved in but they are often  
 out all day so they don't see them    
 that much.                            
    The only thing she didn't like     
 about the area was the noise from the 
 low-flying aircraft going over to     
 Chivenor Airbase.She liked everything 
 else.                                 </content>
