		<content> These vary from  manors to  farms  and
 cottages.  Many are  fine  examples of
 their type.  Some are listed buildings
 possibly  eligible for  grant aid from
 the local authority, with restrictions
 on alterations.  Except for those con-
 cerned with religion, trade or educat-
 ion the properties are family homes   
 not open to the public. {Tonacombe}and
{Marsland Manors }are both  of medieval
 origin. {Tonacombe}has  a particularly
 fine and unaltered Tudor interior. The
{Bush Inn}at{Crosstown}and{Rectory Farm
 both claim 13th  century  origin,  and
 are open  to the  public as  a  public
 house and tea room respectively.{"Sun-
{shine Alley"}at{Crosstown }is  a  good
 example  of  a  traditional  cob   and
 thatch cottage.  At{Shop, Chapel House
 may be built on the site of a medieval
 chapel.
