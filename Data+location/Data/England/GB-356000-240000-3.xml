 every year.The farm itself has 84     
 acres but rents other land from       
 neighbouring farms making 120 acres   
 altogether.The area where the farm is 
 situated is too hilly for growing     
 grain, so it is all grass land.The    
 grass is used for silage which is made
 twice a year and is stored in a big   
 metal shed,with a plastic sheet       
 over it, held down by tyres.
