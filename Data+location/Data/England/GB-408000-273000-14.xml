		<title>14Warwickshire Railway Line</title>
		<content> The Warwickshire line was built by the
 Great Westen Railway in 1908 as a{Main
{Line.}It was an express line from the 
 Midlands to Bristol and the holiday   
 resorts of Cornwall and Devon.Today it
 only takes people from Stratford on   
 Avon to Birmingham (Moor St) as a lot 
 of the main line has been removed.    
 This remaining section is now         
 under threat of closure but this is   
 being strongly opposed by an action   
 group.                              { 
{The Railway Museum }at Tyseley,       
 in Birmingham, has Steam days when    
 Steam trains run from Tyseley to      
 Stratford every three hours. Many     
 people go to watch.                 { 
{The Gloucestershire}and{Warwickshire  
{Railway Society based}at Toddington   
 would like to re_open the whole line  
 from Gloucester to Stratford.
