		<content>   To the young people today Nempnett  
 Thrubwell is still somewhat "ancient",
 the population being mostly middle-   
 aged or elderly. There are very few   
 amenities and almost no entertainment.
 The Mobile Library calls once in two  
 weeks and there are coach trips in the
 summer and a weekly coach service to  
 Bristol. There is no shop, pub or Post
 Office but a good delivery service    
 from shops in neighbouring villages.  
   For some, however, the area is an   
 idyllic haven. For fishermen, bird-   
 watchers, artists, and all who enjoy  
 peaceful solitude it an ideal escape  
 place. There are some signs of change 
 - for better or worse. A number of    
 cottages have been bought, modernised 
 and converted for occupation by       
 professional people and/or commuters. 
 There is a very posh pig unit being   
 built on the site of an old quarry.   </content>
