 Every June, close to St Peter's Day,  
 there is held in Yalding the Village  
 Fair. Many local organisations take   
 part in this event which raises money 
 for local charitable purposes. Some   
 Â£1500 is raised each year and         
 beneficiaries have included the school
 (for purchase of a computer), Village 
 Hall, Cleaves Hall, Yalding Church,   
 and The Weald Playgroup. In December  
 the Christingle Service in church,    
 organised by the School, is becoming  
 an annual custom with an attendance of
 over 200 people. Buston Manor, Hunton,
 sees foxhunting each year. In December
 1982 Mrs Perrins celebrated her 100th 
 birthday, the youngest schoolchild    
 helping her plant a tree on The Green.
 On her birthday schoolchildren sang to
 her, played recorders and read a      
 specially written poem.               </content>
