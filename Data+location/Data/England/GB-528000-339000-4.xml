		<content>{Land type}within the area comprises   
{Grade one land}-land with almost no   
 limitations to agricultural use, grows
 most crops including horticultural    
 crops.                                
{Grade two land}-land with some minor  
 limitations but capable of growing a  
 wide variety of crops.                
{Field size}has increased during the   
 last 30 years with the loss of        
 hedgerows and trees. These changes are
 the result of economic forces, higher 
 output, higher costs and economies    
 achieved by modern technology,        
 especially large scale mechanisation. 
{Increased farm efficiency}-yields of  
 winter wheat have risen by 136%       
 between 1945-1983 due to improved     
 husbandry and varieties. Average yield
 per hectare was 2.66 tonnes in        
 1945-1950 but rose to 6.29 tonnes per 
 hectare by 1979-1981.                 </content>
