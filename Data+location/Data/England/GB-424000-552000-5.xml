		<content> In the Pelton area there is a lot of  
 petty crime. At least 700 people are  
 arrested through the local Pelton     
 office in one year. The Policemen do  
 like working in this area. In the     
 station are based 12 Policemen and 2  
 Sergeants who work 24 hour cover. In  
 this area the main crimes are house   
 burglaries and thefts. The station was
 built in 1983. The criminals are all  
 ages. Our local Sergeant has been in  
 the Force for 26 years during which   
 time he has seen an increased crime   
 rate. The average rate is 55 people   
 convicted per month. The station has  
 got 2 cars and though it is not always
 open, there is always cover from the  
 nearest large office. This office has 
 only 1 holding cell, 1 interview room 
 and the usual accommodation for staff 
 to work and relax.
