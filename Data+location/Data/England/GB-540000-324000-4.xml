		<title>04THE GEDNEYS</title>
		<content> On Saturday 11th May the parish church
 was crowded with over 300 people. They
 were mostly visitors who had come to a
 Reunion service. Many of them were    
 Americans. They were united by the    
 common name of Gedney or Gidney.      
   A lady living in Kent, but formerly 
 from Lincolnshire, had organised a    
 tour for the Gedney Association which 
 has hundreds of members worldwide.    
 They attended a banquet in            
 Peterborough and visited other parts  
 of the country.                       
          They are very few people with
 the name Gedney living locally which  
 must make sense as they presumably    
 only took the name after they left    
 the village, as a mark of a           
 identification.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
