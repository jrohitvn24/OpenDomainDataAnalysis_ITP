		<content> Our Village Shops - Horndon           
 In Horndon we have 3 Shops.  One of   
 them is run by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Burdett.  It
 is a sub-post office, general store   
 and bakery.  Mr. Burdett is the Baker.
 He bakes the bread on his premises    
 with the help of his son Paul.  We    
 have a butcher's shop which has been  
 run by Reg Bye for about 20 years.    
 The third shop sells newspapers,      
 sweets groceries and has an Off       
 Licence.  This shop has just been     
 taken over by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Redhead, who 
 have returned from Australia.  Outside
 Burdett's a man sells green groceries 
 from a stall.  He comes on Tuesday,   
 Friday and Saturday mornings.  There  
 used to be two more Shops one is now a
 private house and the other, which was
 the co-op, is boarded up awaiting     
 development.  The Village blacksmith  
 works behind this shop.               </content>
