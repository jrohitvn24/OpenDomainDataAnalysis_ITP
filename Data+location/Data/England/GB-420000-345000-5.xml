		<content> As you turn right down{Yew tree lane  
 from the{A517, Bradley church}is on   
 the right of the lane.                
 It has parts which are over 600 years 
 old.The main building material for the
{church}is stone.The reason the{church 
 does not have a belltower is because  
 the wooden tower was struck by        
 lightning in a storm.                 
 The belltower has been replaced       
 by a lightning conductor.             
 The{church}is surrounded by a         
 graveyard in which the oldest grave   
 dates back to 1729. People say that   
{Oliver Cromwell}knocked the top off a 
 cross in the graveyard and now all    
 that remains is a post.There is a     
 Saxon stone set in one wall with a    
 carving of Adam and Eve.
