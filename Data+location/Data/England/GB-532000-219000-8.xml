		<content>{CHAIRMAN, LITTLE MUNDEN PARISH        
{COUNCIL:}Mrs. Pat Hibberd was born in 
 Hertfordshire and prefers to live in a
 village rather than a town. She became
 interested in local affairs after     
 joining the Women's Institute and was 
 asked to become a parish councillor   
 and this led her into being elected to
 the District Council.  Mrs. Hibberd   
 does not stand for a political party  
 as she feels politics should not enter
 into local affairs.                   
 She deals with housing repair         
 problems, rehousing, gives advice on  
 form-filling and understanding of     
 official letters; she deals with      
 complaints about roads and footpaths  
 and road signs.{PLANNING APPLICATIONS{

 communities to prevent over           
 development.This year the Council has 
 planted many{trees}in Dane End.       </content>
