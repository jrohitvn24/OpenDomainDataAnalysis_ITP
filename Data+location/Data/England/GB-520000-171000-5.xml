		<title>05Roehampton (2) The Estates</title>
		<content>After World War 2 an area known as     
Alton East, which lies S.W. of         
Roehampton Lane, was developed by the  
London County Council. 3/5 Alton East  
homes are in ten eleven-storey point   
blocks. Heathmere Primary School and a 
small shopping parade serve this area  
where the contour of the land and many 
original trees were preserved.Danebury 
Avenue runs through the estate called  
Alton West. When it was built in the   
late fifties it was a prize-winning    
estate,one of the first to group build-
ings of different heights and sizes on 
one estate.Alton West extends along the
edge of Richmond Park and was built on 
60 acres out of the 100 acres of the   
grounds of Mount Clare,Downshire House 
and Manresa House. It is world famous  
for the design of its apartment blocks 
occupying the sweep of the specially   
landscaped Downshire Field.(cont.over) </content>
