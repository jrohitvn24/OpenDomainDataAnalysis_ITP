		<content>{Canoeing}is a very popular sport in   
 our area.Lots of competitions are held
 on a stretch of the River Tay just    
 below the old shop.They have a special
 competition on Easter weekend and     
 sometimes have canoeing during spring,
 summer and autumn.They have a piece of
 ground up behind our school and they  
 are putting up chalets for the        
 canoeists to stay in.                 
{Shooting}is also popular.There are    
 often lots of shooters after pheasants
 That is a very common bird in our area
 Partridges and pigeons are also shot. 
 We have a{bowling}green in our area   
 where there is a club that practise on
 Monday,Wednesday and Saturday nights. 
 In Strathtay,which is just outside our
 area,there is a nine hole golf course.
