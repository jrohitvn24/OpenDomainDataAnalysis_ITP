		<content> The atmosphere in our area is a lot   
 dirtier, because of the fumes that    
 travel from a nearby motorway.The{    
{wildlife}is also dying off because of 
{pesticides}and pollution.Round our    
 school the grass has gone brown       
 because of the farmers{pesticides.    
 People can remember when{footpaths    
 could be clearly seen and  were mainly
 mud tracks.Marr church yard is a haven
 for wildflowers e.g. primroses, wild  
 violets and cowslips. In our area the 
 main part of{wildlife}is bird life,the
 commonest bird is the starling,the    
 rarest bird is the curlew.Many birds  
 of prey in our area are found on the  
 motorway.We have left part of our     
 field to go wild and have sent for    
 some wild flower seeds to plant.The   
 seeds will be planted in the Autumn so
 that butterflies  and insects will be 
 attracted to a safe area for them.    </content>
