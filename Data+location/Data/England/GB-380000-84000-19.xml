		<title>19'RED LION INN'</title>
		<content> At East Fossil Farm they used to make 
 Caerphilly Cheese as late as 1958,but 
 with the new regulations the licence  
 was withdrawn.The word"Fossil"is a    
 corruption of "Fuzzhill"."Fuzz"being  
 the local name for gorse bushes,which 
 still grow abundantly especially on   
 the heath.                            
 At the junction of the village street 
 and the A352 main road stands the 'Red
 Lion Inn'.Outside is a telephone box. 
 The inn was once a coaching halt but  
 parts of it date back to the  15th.   
 Century,and were built of cob and     
 thatch.The thatch had just been       
 rethatched in 1965 when it caught fire
 The inn now has a tiled roof and only 
 the 'Pool Room'has a thatch.          
 It does a good trade in meals         
 especially at lunch times.
