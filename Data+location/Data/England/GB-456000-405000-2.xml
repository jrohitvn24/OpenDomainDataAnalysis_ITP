		<title>02ARKSEY CHURCH</title>
		<content>  Just outside Bentley there is a      
 little                                
 village called Arksey.One of the main 
 features of Arksey is the All Saint's 
 Parish Church which was built in 1122.
 The money was given to pay for the    
 church by Sir Thomas Cook.            
  The church has an enchanting display 
 of stained glass windows and comprises
 numerous interesting monuments such   
 as the statue of Sir Thomas Cook's    
 head and also lots of plaques.        
  Outside the Church there is a lepers'
 squint which is what the people who   
 had leprosy could watch the church    
 service through without going near the
 people because they thought you could 
 catch leprosy from people who had     
 it.That is why the lepers' squint is  
 there.Since leprosy can be cured now  
 the lepers' squint has been filled in 
 with cement.                          </content>
