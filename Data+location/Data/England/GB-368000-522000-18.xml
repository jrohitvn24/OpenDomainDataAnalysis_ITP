		<title>18BUS SERVICES TO BRAMPTON</title>
		<content> Due to the recent change in government
 policy,the scheduled bus services in  
 this area are now almost non-existant.
 Between May &amp; September 1985,there was
 only 1 bus each week.This ran on      
 Penrith Market Day (Tuesdays) between 
 Penrith &amp; Appleby &amp; passes through the
 village of Brampton. Since September  
 the service also runs on Fridays.     
 Previously the service was more       
 frequent,being 2 buses in each        
 direction,Monday to Friday,with extra 
 buses on Tuesdays,Thursdays &amp;         
 Saturdays.The service also used to    
 continue South to Kirkby Stephen.     
 Dufton is no longer served by any     
 scheduled service whereas before there
 were 2 buses a week in each direction 
 (Thursdays &amp; Saturdays).The only other
 buses are the school &amp; works buses.The
 school buses take children fom Dufton 
 &amp; Brampton to Long Marton &amp; Appleby.  </content>
