		<title>01INTRODUCTION W.CHILTINGTON</title>
		<content>    In our village our roads have no   
 speed limits or lights. Also you can't
 enter the village without going up or 
 down a hill.                          
   West Chiltington is quite big but   
 lots of new houses have been built in 
 our playing areas. For instance down  
{Nyetimber}there used to be a big wood 
 which was nice to play in and feed the
 horses. But a firm wanted to buy the  
 land the horses were moved and all the
 trees were knocked down by a digger,  
 one of the biggest in the world. Some 
 weeks after that when they started to 
 build the houses there was much more  
 light on the road.                    
   Our{church}up the village has the   
 second most important{wall paintings  
 in England.                           
   I like W.Chiltington for its        
{countryside and farms.}It has a lot of
{fields and wildlife}all around.       </content>
