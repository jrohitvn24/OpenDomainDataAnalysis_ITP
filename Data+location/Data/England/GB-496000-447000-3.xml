 where religious services are held.    
 There are three Church of England     
 churches and two Methodist chapels.   
 The rector of Lockington is in charge 
 of the churches at Lockington and     
 Lund.There is one service each Sunday 
 at Lockington either in the morning   
 or the evening and also at Lund.There 
 is a Sunday School at Lund for the    
 children.In Lockington there is a     
 service every Sunday evening in the   
 chapel and in Lund the chapel services
 are also every Sunday.People who are  
 Roman Catholics have to go to the     
 church in Beverley or Market Weighton 
 about 6 miles away.
