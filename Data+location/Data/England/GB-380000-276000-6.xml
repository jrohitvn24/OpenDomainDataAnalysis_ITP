		<title>06A Day in School</title>
		<content> By Lorraine Osborne                   
 I get up in the morning at 7 o'clock. 
 I get dressed and have breakfast,then 
 we put our coats on and my sister and 
 I have a race. I always beat her to   
 school.When we get to school,I take my
 coat off and hang my bag up and go in 
 the class.I get my book out and get on
 with my work.I work on until playtime.
 Three bells go and we have to go out  
 to play.I play ball with Emily and    
 Trisha.When the bell rings,we all go  
 back to our classes and we do some    
 number work or something.Then the bell
 goes for dinner and we all get our    
 lunch boxes and line up by the door.  
 We go into the hall and have our      
 lunch.When we finish our lunch we go  
 out to play.We have about 40 minutes  
 play and then the bell goes for work  
 and we all go to work for about an    
 hour,when it is afternoon play.       </content>
