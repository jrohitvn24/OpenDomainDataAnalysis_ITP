		<content> At 12.00 we are sleeping silently but 
 sometimes we go to bed late.If we do  
 then it is hard to get up the         
 following morning.We usually get up   
 early at 6.30.We watch television for 
 a while and soon we have our breakfast
 and a cup of tea.We then have a wash  
 and brush our teeth and get ready for 
 school.                               
 When we are ready we play games on our
 computers.There are many games that we
 like such as:                         
 Galaxy,Testmatch,Zap,Zaxxon,Bonkey,Gho
 stbusters,Hunchback,Radar Rat Race and
 Donkey Kong.                          
  After playing on the computer we get 
 our sandwiches ready and pack our bags
 with our P.E. kit.We like P.E. because
 we play football,horse and jockey and 
 ball throwing but we like rounders    
 best of all.                          
 When we're ready we set off for school</content>
