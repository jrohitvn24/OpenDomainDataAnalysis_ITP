		<content> MOST HOUSING IS IN THE VILLAGE ITSELF.
 OUTLYING HOUSING IS MAINLY FARMHOUSES,
 TIED COTTAGES, CONVERTED FARMHOUSES OR
 RESTORED COTTAGES. EXAMPLES OF        
 DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE EXIST FROM      
 MEDIEVAL TO PRESENT DAY BUT MOST      
 DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE    
 LAST 20 YEARS WITH FARMLAND, OPEN     
 SPACES AND GROUNDS OF LARGE HOUSES    
 BUILT UPON. THE MAJORITY OF HOUSES ARE
 PRIVATELY OWNED INCLUDING SOME        
 EX-HORSHAM COUNCIL HOUSES AND ARE     
 CONCENTRATED AROUND ROWAN DRIVE WITH A
 SMALLER DEVELOPMENT AT ROSEHILL. ONE  
 LAST OPEN SPACE, HOBSONS FIELD HAS    
 PLANNING CONSENT BUT REMAINS          
 UNDEVELOPED. A BYPASS MIGHT BRING     
 FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE NO     
 LARGE BLOCKS OF FLATS, NOR SLUMS.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
