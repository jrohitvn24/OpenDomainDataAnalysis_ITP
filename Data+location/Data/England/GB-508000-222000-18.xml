 Class 2C &amp; 2E of William Austin junior
 school went out twice to survey the   
 land use of their area. We found that 
 out of 1592 houses, 123 had extensions
 built. There were 116 detached houses,
 1077 semi-detached houses, 119        
 bungalows and 230 terraced houses. Of 
 the 1592 houses we found 653 were     
 built of bricks, 637 were part brick, 
 part pebbledash, 148 houses had a     
 stucco finish, 141 were all pebbledash
 and 13 were mock stone cladded. There 
 were 1320 houses with tiles on the    
 roof and 272 with slates. 1375 homes  
 had retained their front garden but   
 214 had changed them into a car       
 parking space. 1047 houses had a      
 garage.                               </content>
