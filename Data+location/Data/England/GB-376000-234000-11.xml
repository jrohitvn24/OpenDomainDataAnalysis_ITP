		<title>11CUSTOMS IN BERROW</title>
		<content>     Customs in Berrow centre on the   
 church. Many people come to{Harvest   
{Festival}Services and Pendock Parish  
 shares a Harvest Supper held in Berrow
 Church Hall. A summer{fete}is held    
 annually to raise money for the Church
 and consists of various stalls with   
 home-made goods, jumble, produce,     
 supported by games and raffles with   
 some form of entertainment.           
     Also connected with the Church is 
 the{Nan-Fan Sermon.}In 1745 Susannah  
 Cocks Nan-Fan left a legacy of Â£4O to 
 be put "out to interest". 1O shillings
 of this was to be paid to the minister
 yearly in perpetuity if a sermon was  
 preached on February 5th every year:  
 the rest was to go to the poor. This  
 was as thanks for "deliverance from   
 the violent designs of an unnatural   
 enemy". This still takes place.
