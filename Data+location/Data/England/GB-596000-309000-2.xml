		<title>02TOFTWOOD POPULATION</title>
		<content> In 1086 when the Domesday Book was    
 compiled, Westfield, then called      
 Westfelda, was little more than a     
 hamlet with one man, the abbot of Ely 
 owning all the land. He also owned 16 
 unfree men and their families. From a 
 hamlet with one landowner Westfield   
 has grown slowly to a present         
 population of 200. Toftwood, in       
 comparison has grown from one house in
 an area of woodland in 1086, to become
 a present day suburb of Dereham with a
 population of over 5,000. Nearly all  
 of this population growth has taken   
 place since the 1960s as a result of  
 the rapid expansion of the town.      
 Almost all of the housing here is     
 privately owned and reasonably priced 
 and attracts first time buyers, people
 with young families and retired       
 people.                               
                                       </content>
