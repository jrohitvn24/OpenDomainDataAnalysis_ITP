   The Imperial Chemical Industries    
 plant at Wilton was started in 1946 to
 cope with the vast demands for        
 materials to help rebuild Britain     
 after WW2,and is concerned with making
 products from hydrocarbons(organic    
 chemicals).The site covers about 2000 
 acres,employs 7000 people and is      
 situated on the South bank of the Tees
 between Redcar and Eston.It is flat   
 and on boulder clay,making it ideal   
 for supporting heavy buildings,and is 
 also covenient for the nearby Tees    
 Docks.                                
   Due to the local steel              
 production,there was a good pool of   
 personnel available to build and      
 maintain a large chemical complex,and 
 coal was available from Durham.
