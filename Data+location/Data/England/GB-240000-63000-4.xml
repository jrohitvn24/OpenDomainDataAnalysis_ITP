		<content> The west and east banks of the River  
 Tamar provide a similar kind of{      
{employment}even though it marks the   
 boundary between two counties. The    
 majority of people are self-employed  
 and{farming}is the main occupation.   
 Farms have either a dairy or beef herd
 alongside arable crops, one           
 specialising in the sale of cream.    
 During the season salmon are caught   
 from designated pools and eels are    
 becoming an established{trade}. Market
 gardens commercially produce flowers, 
 fruit, vegetables and shrubs. Some    
 businesses provide employent such as  
 the Boatyard, Building Contractor,    
 Wholesale Nursery and Helicopter      
 Crop-Spraying. The{population}is      
 mainly middle-class, a proportion     
 being retired and the remainder       
 working in nearby villages, towns or  
 cities, many in education.            </content>
