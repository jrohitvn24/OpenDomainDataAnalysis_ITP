about 8.10 and then walk to the village
bus-stop.From here I and the other     
pupils of Litcham School from my vill- 
age are picked up by a private bus and 
are taken to school.We arrive at school
at 8.35.A bell rings at 8.55 for regis-
ration.After this which ends at 9.20 o-
ur lessons begin.Here is a list of the 
lessons we have and how many times we  
have them each week:English,Maths and  
Humanities,we have 6 periods of each   
of these a week.German,Craft,Physical
