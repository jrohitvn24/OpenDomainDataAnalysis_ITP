		<title>17DEEPING ST.JAMES PRIORY FARM</title>
		<content>    Priory Farm is an arable farm.This 
 year the crops are 195 acres of winter
 wheat,20 acres of winter barley,18    
 acres of spring barley,63 acres of    
 winter oil seed rape,20 acres of peas,
 35 acres of tick beans.Lupins are a   
 new crop this year. They are being    
 grown for cattle feed.                
    The farmer grows the same crops    
 every year.He doesn't think he will   
 grow lupins again as it wasn't a very 
 good crop in the trial run he had this
 year.He mainly sells all his crop to  
 two merchants who come and look at it 
 in the field and then will give a     
 price.If the farmer doesn't think he  
 will get a higher price later on in   
 the month he sells it straight away to
 the merchant.One of the merchants     
 sends the wheat to Boston Docks to be 
 sent abroad. Another buys the peas    
 for cattle feed.                      </content>
