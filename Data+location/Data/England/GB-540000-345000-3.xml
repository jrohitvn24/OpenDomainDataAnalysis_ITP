		<title>03Mobile Library in Leverton</title>
		<content> Once a fortnight we are visited by the
{mobile library }which comes to the    
 village on a Monday and stops outside 
 the school at 2 o'clock for forty-five
 minutes.The librarian's name is Gordon
 White and he has worked on the libary 
 van for 22 years.He says he enjoys his
 work very much.On Wednesdays the van  
 is either cleaned and serviced or     
 visits old peoples homes and the North
 sea camp.The libary van covers between
 20 and 44 miles per day.It covers the 
 rural areas around Boston.We asked if 
 anything funny had happened to him and
 Mr White replied"This interview."     
 Apart from that he could not think of 
 anything on the spur of the moment .He
 also said that they had had an        
 accident involving 3 other vehicles,  
 but no-one was hurt.He thinks that the
 library van is a good idea and so do  
 many others in the village.           </content>
