and the problems that they face in     
life.They do not ignore such sensitive 
subjects as sex,crime and racial       
discrimination.By coming to this youth 
centre people are able to meet others  
with similar interests.The youth centre
is also open to the public by providing
such facilities as pre-school nursery  
and an old age pensioners club. The    
youth centre is highly thought of by   
all who attend it.Take for example     
Sophie Baker,my school friend,"The     
centre is brilliant.It is a great place
for people who have nowhere else to go.
I really have enjoyed the camping trips
they have organised and am looking     
forward to the planned barge trip."    
It is a very good place for young      
people who haven't much money to spend 
and who need the back up services      
provided.                              </content>
