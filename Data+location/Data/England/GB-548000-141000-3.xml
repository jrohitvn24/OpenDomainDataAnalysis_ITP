		<content> This very rural area is composed of   
 grazing &amp; arable land with large areas
 of hardwood &amp; coniferous woodland.    
 Until the recent sale of the Hever    
 Estate the woods were used mainly for 
 pheasant rearing for sport. Now the   
 farms are in private hands more wood  
 is cut for land clearance &amp; cash      
 crops. Due to EEC regulations there   
 are fewer dairy farms so less good hay
 &amp; corn for home consumption are grown.
 More sheep, pigs &amp; beef are raised.   
 Seed corn, rape, potatoes &amp; peas are  
 grown. Changed nature of beer         
 manufacture means less hops are needed
 leading to conversion of oasts &amp; barns
 to homes for affluent commuters. A    
 thriving vinery produces good white   
 wine. All farms have good road        
 connections. Several farmers wives    
 provide bed &amp; breakfast for tourists.
