		<title>03Life in Wall Wood, Harpenden</title>
		<content> My name is{Claire Wardle.             
 I live in the middle of a wood called 
{Wall Wood.}One lovely sight I have    
 seen in my garden is{a big doe deer   
{with her baby fawn}strolling across   
 on a summer's afternoon. Some of our  
 garden is wood too.{In our garden we  
{have a swimming pool,}and{we have a   
{number of animals: 2 Dogs, 7 Chickens,
{2 Goldfish, 1 Hamster, 1 Cockerel, and
{1 Goose.}My dad managed to bring a    
{gosling}home from the farm because the
{mother goose}was treading all over her
{young}and might have killed them. I   
 looked after it,{and now we have a    
{fully grown Gander}who is very{fierce.
 He guards the house and will attack   
 strangers.{He can't fly because his   
{wings were injured}and they stick out.
 I enjoy living in Wall Wood.
