		<content>    The church of{St.Mary the Virgin   
 Rowner has a long and illustrious     
 history.There has been a church on    
 this site since{1054}, which is       
 mentioned in the original{Domesday    
{Book.}The present church consists of a
 small{13th. century building}and a new
 extension which was consecrated in    
{1966.}This was built to serve the new 
 Naval estate and private housing      
 development in the Rowner war.Prior to
 the 1960's the old church served a    
 predominantly rural area on the fringe
 of Gosport.The character of the area  
 changed dramatically from rural to    
 urban,thus the need for the extension.
 About 16 regular services are held    
 each week,supplemented by about 50    
 weddings,120 Christenings and 90      
 funerals in an average year.Groups    
 using the church include Cubs,Guides, 
 Brownies,Mothers Union &amp; youth groups.</content>
