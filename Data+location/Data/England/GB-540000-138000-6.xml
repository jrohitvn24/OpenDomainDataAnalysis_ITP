		<content>  When we were travelling roud the area
 we began to notice the number of "For 
 Sale" notices. Many of the notices re-
 ferred to one large estate was being  
 broken up.This meant that about 500   
 acres in the area.There were also     
 other areas of land for sale.         
 One farmer said that there were too   
 many horses! He explained that too    
 many small farms were not economic and
 that people were starting riding      
 schools or renting out fields for     
 grazing.
