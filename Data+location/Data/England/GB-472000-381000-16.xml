 With the survey area being a rural    
 setting, it is surprising for visitors
 to find such a busy major road running
 through the villages.                 
 Traffic surveys have shown that during
 daylight hours the average traffic    
 volume using the A 620 exceeds 600    
 vehicles an hour.  Many of the        
 vehicles are heavy lorries            
 transporting coal to the power        
 stations in the Trent Valley.During   
 the recent miner's strike the volume  
 of road traffic was even heavier than 
 usual,and the village streets were    
 blackened by coal dust.Now that things
 are back to normal the majority of    
 coal is once again transported by     
 rail.
