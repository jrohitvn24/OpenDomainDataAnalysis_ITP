		<title>07BLACKBIRD FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>      A few weeks ago it was Blackbird 
Leys Festival week.   Festival week is 
when everybody enjoys themselves.      
There were lots of activities and many 
things to do.                          
     There were inflatables and Fun in 
the Parks for the children and for the 
adults there were beer tents, music and
bands.   At school there was a football
match, the fourth year girls versus the
P.T.A. ladies, and the fourth year     
girls won.   I scored the only goal!   
     There was a fair as well.   I went
to the fair nearly every day and I saw 
some of my friends there.   I went on  
all the rides and I had candyfloss,    
toffee apples, chips and drinks.       
     I think it is really good to see  
the old mix in with the young at the   
Festival.
