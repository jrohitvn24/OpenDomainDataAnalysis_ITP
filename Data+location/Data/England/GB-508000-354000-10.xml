		<title>10A day in the life of Dean.</title>
		<content> On Sunday I woke up at 8.15 a.m. and  
 read until 8.45 a.m.  Then I got up   
 and went downstairs.  I switched on   
 the television but there was nothing  
 interesting so I listened to the      
 radio.                                
 At 9.OO a.m. I made myself breakfast  
 and then I washed and dressed.  At    
 9.45 a.m. I went with my dad to feed  
 the cats at the place where he works. 
 When we came back I played outside    
 until dinner time.  For dinner we had 
 roast beef, potatoes and vegetables.  
 At 2.OO p.m. I helped my dad clean the
 fish pond.  Then we went in for tea.  
 At 4.45 p.m. I helped my dad mend my  
 bicycle.  In the evening I played     
 snooker and watched television.       
 Before bed I had a bath and washed my 
 hair.  I went to bed at 9.3O p.m.,    
 read for half an hour and fell asleep 
 at 1O.15 p.m.                         </content>
