		<content>    We interviewed a local farmer who  
 told us about his farm and the changes
 he had seen since the 1950's. The farm
 was built in the 1930's, originally as
 a hunting lodge. The farmer bought the
 land and the house in 1956 from a     
 tenant farmer, who although of ninety 
 years of age was most reluctant to    
 leave the house and said "that if     
 necessary he could farm from his      
 bed!"                                 
    The first major change was the     
 arrival of electricity in the 1950's. 
 Then in the 1960's came mains water   
 and the end of the railway service to 
 Cheltenham. This meant that the sheep 
 were no longer taken from Andoversford
 by train. Also the fertiliser and corn
 seed for the land was collected from  
 the railway station at Andoversford   
 now had to be delivered from          
 Gloucester by lorry.                  </content>
