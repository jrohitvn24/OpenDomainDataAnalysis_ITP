		<title>02WORK IN THE CLATFORD AREA</title>
		<content> We surveyed Clatford and Wherwell     
 schools and asked the children about  
 the{employment}of their parents.We    
 also asked whether their parents{     
{commuted}or worked locally.At both    
 schools a high proportion of mothers  
 stayed at home.Of the{employed}       
 population the majority work in an    
 office.                               
 We discovered that out of the two     
 areas only two parents were unemployed
 -a very low percentage of 1% are{     
{unemployed}in this area.
