		<title>04A Day in my life-2 Afternoon</title>
		<content>I have a packed lunch so I go into     
dinner after the people who have cooked
school lunches. Then I go out to play  
with my friends. At 1.00pm dinner break
ends and we go back to work. Sometimes 
we carry on with work from the morning,
but often we start new work. It is     
2.00pm when we stop work and have a    
short break of 15 minutes. We return to
work until 3.00pm when we finish school
for the day. During the day, some of   
the subjects we do include maths,      
English, reading, science, music, art, 
craft, and projects.                   
Sometimes I stay for clubs or I go     
home and change my clothes before I go 
out with my friends. I have tea at     
5.30pm. In the summer I go out again   
until 7.30pm when I go in to watch     
T.V. until 8.30pm when I have my       
supper and get ready for bed at 9.00pm.
