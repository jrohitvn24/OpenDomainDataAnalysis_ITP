 early 13th century.The church is      
 dedicated to St Giles it is built up  
 on a hill and it looks over most of   
 the village.There are many interesting
 features we can see local             
 stones,sandstone from Staffordshire   
 and the white limestone from          
 Derbyshire.Inside the church are a    
 number of medievel relics.a long stone
 coffin was found underneath the floor 
 of the nave.On it was a figure of a   
 woman holding a heart between her     
 hands.In the grave yard there is one  
 anceint tomb and you can see the      
 bones though cracks under the lid.In  
 the tower are three bells from the    
 17th century.The oldest bell still    
 chimes every hour.the church has got a
 flower group and a bible reading      
 group.It always looks welcoming and   
 sparkling clean.                      </content>
