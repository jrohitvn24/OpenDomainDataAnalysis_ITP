 The area in the block continues to be 
 much as it has always been, a rural   
 agricultural society. However despite 
 this common background there has over 
 the years been marked and radical     
 changes in it's domestic and social   
 life and activites.                   
    The following pages set out to     
 illustrate some of the facets of life 
 lived in a small community at no great
 distance from places of considerable  
 commercial and industrial influence.  
    The early pages concentrate on     
 general topics. Later pages cover more
 particular points of interest such as 
 places and buildings. The last few    
 pages are more reflective. We hope    
 that any interested person browsing   
 through these pages will picture life 
 here as it is in 1985.
