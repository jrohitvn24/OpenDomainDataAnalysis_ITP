		<title>15THE OAK HOUSE, OLDBURY</title>
		<content>  The Oak House takes its name from an 
 enormous oak tree, which stood in     
 front of the building until the tree  
 was destroyed by fire in 1800.        
  There is not a record of the builder 
 of the propety, but the Turton family 
 were in residence for most of the 17C.
 They were active members of the       
 community and during the Civil War    
 supported the Parliamentary forces. In
 1894 Alderman Farley bought and       
 restored Oak House and presented it to
 the town. It operated as a museum     
 until 1951, when it was re-furnished  
 in the style of the 17C. Among the    
 many interesting items to be seen are 
 some old church chests, several long  
 case clocks, an early 17C oak press   
 and a William &amp; Mary oak bureau. Today
 it is visited by many school parties  
 who are given free guided tours.
