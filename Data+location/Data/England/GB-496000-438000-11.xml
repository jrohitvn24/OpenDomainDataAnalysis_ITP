{horse, Altisidora.}Overall, custom is 
 made up of{10% locals,  90% visitors, 
 proportions differing according to the

 Agricultural College, especially      
 during the first term of the year.    
 Busiest times are at the weekend and  
 during school holidays.  There has    
 been a general increase in the sale of
 pub food and has a designated area to 
 cater for it.  Also there has been a  
 switch in preference from beer to     
 lager.  It attracts much passing      
 trade, being situated on the main York

 photographed pub in Britain.  Public  
 opinion indicates opening hours should
 become more flexible, with short hours
 at the beginning of the week and      
 longer hours at the weekend.          </content>
