		<title>18CUSTOMS AND DIALECT</title>
		<content> Many ancient customs are still ob-    
 served. It is thought to bring good   
 luck if a dark man carrying a piece of
 coal is the "first foot" to enter the 
 house after midnight on New Year's    
 Eve. Pancakes are eaten on Shrove     
 Tuesday and paste eggs, dyed with on- 
 ion skins, coltsfoot, lichen and cloth
 scraps are jarped (banged together to 
 see whose egg has the strongest shell)
 and eaten at Easter. At Halloween     
 doors are tied and gates removed and  
 bonfires are lit on November 5th.     
 Whilst a wedding is taking place the  
 church gates are tied and not opened  
 until money is thrown. Christmas is   
 celebrated with carol singing, church 
 services, Cristmas Cake with cheese   
 and wine, Christmas puddings and mince
 pies.  The Weardale dialect is still  
 spoken by older members of the commun-
 ity.                                  </content>
