		<title>13Trade in Newton and Linton</title>
		<content> The north of the area is well served  
 by two shops in Linton and one in     
 Newton-on-Ouse.One Linton shop        
 incorporates a Post Office.The other  
 sells newspapers,delivering twice     
 daily to both villages,and fish and   
 chips from a building at the rear.    
   Mobile shops,an asset to the        
 area,sell fruit,vegetables,meat,fish, 
 bread and cakes.A video library and a 
 fish and chip van visit once a week.  
    In Newton there is a filling and   
 service station,a tree nursery and a  
 plant nursery,with a small market     
 garden selling soft fruit and flowers 
 in Linton-on-Ouse.                    
   Many people make regular visits to  
 York and other neighbouring towns to  
 buy food at supermarkets.No shops     
 exist in Widdington,the nearest being 
 in Nun Monkton,two miles distant,from 
 where newspapers are collected.       </content>
