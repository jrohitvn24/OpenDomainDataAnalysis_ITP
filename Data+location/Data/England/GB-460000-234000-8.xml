		<content> The oldest and most interesting       
 buildings in this block are the church
 of St.Augustine,Westbury its old      
 vicarage, original farm houses and    
 Westbury Manor which exhibits features
 from various phases over the last 250 
 years.The local oolitic limestone has 
 been used to good effect in many of   
 the old buildings.Those in the village
 used to have thatched roofs but only 2
 now remain.The church dates from      
 Norman times but additions and        
 alterations have been made up to the  
 last century.The Manor is now a school
 but fine plastered ceilings and other 
 architectural features can still be   
 seen.Westbury mill last ground corn in
 the 1920's using a mixture of water   
 and steam power.It has now been       
 converted to a variety of craft,      
 retail and residential uses.
