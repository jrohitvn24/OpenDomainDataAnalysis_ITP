		<title>01The Kilpeck and Orcop area</title>
		<content> This area consists mostly of livestock
 farms producing milk, beef cattle and 
 sheep.  The predominant crop being    
 grass but some cereals and root crops 
 are grown. Because the farms are      
 mostly smallish, so also are the      
 fields and the area therefore has many
 hedgerows. Towards the south east     
 there is a large area of woodland,    
 mostly deciduous and the remainder has
 many small woods, spinneys and        
 hedgerow trees inhabited by a         
 profusion of wild life. The many hills
 and valleys provide outstanding       
 panoramic views. Kilpeck village lies 
 in the NW and is known for iits small 
 Norman church with its stone carvings.
 Nearby are the remains of a Norman    
 castle and earthworks indicare the    
 site of a Mediaeval village. The      
 village of Orcop lies to the south    
 west.                                 </content>
