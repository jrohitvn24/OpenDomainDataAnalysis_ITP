   In our square the people are quite  
 friendly. The area is a quiet         
 residental place, except for Northam  
 Bridge, where buses are always running
 to and fro. The bus service is a      
 regular one, and is nearly always on  
 time.                                 
   There are not many facilities for   
 the children or adults, but there is  
 the rowing club which many people     
 attend.                               
   Most people who live in this area   
 would like to see more public houses. 
   There is a manor too, which was     
 built on the edge of a Roman site.
