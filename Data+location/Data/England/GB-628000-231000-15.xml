		<title>15Tourism Survey</title>
		<content>We asked 10 different questions.       
1.  Do you live in Felixstowe?         
We found from our survey that there    
were 62 who donÂ£t live in Felixstowe   
and 5 who did. We did not include      
these 5 people in our survey.          
                                       
2.Have you been here before?           
We found from our survey that 42 people
have been here before, and 5 have not  
visited Felixstowe before. It seems    
that most visitors return to Felixstowe
                                       
3.We asked people, "Where are you      
staying?" and 13 of them said,"I am    
down here on a day trip," 14 of them   
said,"I am staying at a camp site" 1   
of them said,"I am staying with        
friends." 1 said,"I am staying on a    
ship,"       1 said, "I am staying in  
a lorry," and 1 said, "I am staying in 
an hotel".                             </content>
