		<content>  The area cotains mainly              
 owner-occupied                        
 houses,with somme divide into flats.  
 Most was built in the 1930s, though   
 some is older(1900s). Most people     
 living here work in London and travel 
 there by undergound {railway} or by { 
{bus}.                                 
 The people in the area are from       
 several {ethnic}groups, mainly from   
 Asia and Europe, with a small number  
 of West Indians. There is little      
 unemployment in the area. Most people 
 work in service industries in London  
 and Haringey. There are few           
 manufacturing jobs. Most people said  
 that the local people "keep themselves
 to themselves". There is a wide social
 mix and though families tend to be    
 close, this does not extend to the    
 community as a whole.
