		<title>13 AN OLD FARM</title>
		<content>  Barn farm is a beautiful old         
 farmhouse on Heath Road in the village
 of Ramsden Heath. The farm was built  
 in about{1450,}and most of it is as it
 was originally. The house was added in
 1900.                                 
  The farm is not used as a dairy farm 
 any longer, having a stock of only    
 30 dry cows. During the 35 years      
 the present owner has lived here, the 
 farm has changed its purpose          
 completely.Barn Farm is now a packing 
 station for the egg marketing board.  
 Eggs are brought here from all        
 over the area to be checked, graded,  
 and packed. Finally the cases of eggs 
 are delivered to local shops.         
  The farm is also a meeting place for 
 some villagers. A weekly bridge club  
 is held there, and every summer a     
 village fete.
