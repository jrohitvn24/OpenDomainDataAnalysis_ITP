		<content>    {Ashington}is situated in West     
 Sussex on the main{A.24}Horsham (10   
 miles) to Worthing (10 miles) road. It
 was mentioned in the original Domesday
 survey and until the end of the Second
 World War was a small village housing 
 people mainly involved in farming.    
    The village has developed in a     
 linear fashion to the west of the     
 main road.                            
    Today there is a{population}of     
 nearly{1,700}but with proposed major  
 development in the near future this   
 figure might be raised to nearly      
 3,000.                                
    Many of the people living here     
 today are either elderly or have      
 employment outside the village.       
    The village boundary covers an{area
 of about{2,314 acres}with nearly{500  
{houses,}about{100}of which are        
 owned by the local council authority. </content>
