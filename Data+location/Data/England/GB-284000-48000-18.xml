		<title>18THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
    Just outside{Stoke Fleming}is a    
 large building looking like a stone   
 walled bungalow.Actually it is the    
{telephone exchange.}It has been built 
 to blend in with its beautiful area.  
    It is very big because it is not   
 just the village's phone lines which  
 go there. From{Blackpool Sands}a cable
 goes under the sea to the{Channel     
{Islands. }It can carry 500 telephone  
 calls at once.                        
   In our visit to the Exchange we saw 
 where it joins the national phone     
 system. In the exchange they have     
 their own enormous{generators}to keep 
 the phones working if there is a cut  
 in the electricity supply.            
    The exchange is{automatic}and we   
 watched the numbers being dialled.
