		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF THRESHFIELD</title>
		<content>{                                      
{Threshfield}is a typical Anglian name 
 given by the people who came to this  
 country during the{4th}to{7th         
{centuries A.D.}Long before{Threshfield
 had a humpbacked bridge there was a   
{ford}for cars to go through. The first
  written records of{Threshfield}are in
{The Domesday Book 1087}and are very   
 short and brief. At{Threshfield}in the
 year{1087}there were{8}families but   
 when they looked again in{1285}there  
 were{12}families.{Threshfield}means   
{'Threshing field.'}The name probably  
 arose for an outlying, small Hamlet   
 when{Grassington}expanded. Later it   
 grew into an independant village with 
 its own cultivated fields.            
 Today{Threshfield}is a village of some
{200}families with the majority of     
 people working away from the area.
