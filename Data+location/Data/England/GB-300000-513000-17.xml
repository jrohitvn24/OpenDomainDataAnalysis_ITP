		<title>17CLEATOR - THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Cleator has existed for far longer    
 than any other settlement in the      
 block.Caesar Caine, the vicar of St   
 Leonard's Church,Cleator, in the the  
 1920's wrote a lengthy book about     
 Cleator and Cleator Moor, and in it   
 he gives reasons for thinking that a  
 church may have existed on the site   
 since the 5th century.                
                                       
 The village consists of a main road   
 with terraces of small houses with no 
 gardens along either side. Housing is 
 certainly unique in this area. Most of
 it was put up quickly and cheaply to  
 house the mine workers and their      
 families. They had no bathrooms,      
 indoor toilets or gardens, although   
 most have now been modernised.        
                                       
 Cleator has a sewage works, a garden  
 centre, a factory and a nearby lake.  </content>
