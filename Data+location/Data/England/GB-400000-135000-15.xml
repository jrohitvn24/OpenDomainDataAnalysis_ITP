		<title>15Steeple Langford Shop</title>
		<content> In the village there is only one shop 
 and it plays a very important part in 
 village life.It has a Post Office     
 attached and a telephone box outside. 
 The village shop of today is in many  
 ways a back up service for a lot of   
 people who use it to top up their     
 shopping after they have been to the  
 nearest big town.However, many people 
 realise that there are advantages to  
 be gained by shopping locally, such as
 less travelling ,saving on fares and  
 no queuing for buses.Also with one    
 visit to the village shop they can do 
 the shopping,pay some bills,get stamps
 or postal orders,advertise items for  
 sale and have a chat.In other words   
 the shop is still a focal point of    
 village life.Not only can you buy most
 things,but also it is a central point 
 for passing on information and        
 obtaining assistance.                 </content>
