		<title>14Eartham Village.</title>
		<content> This village is a small typically     
 Sussex village, with neat and tidy    
 flint and brick cottages. The         
 residents of the village are, in the  
 main, farm workers, commuters and     
 retired people. They number less than 
 100.                                  
 There is a charming 12th century      
 church,a manor house,now Great Ballard
 Preparaory School,and a public house, 
 The George Inn. This is a small       
 friendly pub.,with a restaurant and a 
 large garden for summer use. The      
 village is small and has no State     
 school,shops,post office or regular   
 bus service, but for all that has a   
 great deal of unspoilt charm. There is
 a bird sanctury,Brent Loadge,where    
 injured birds are cared for. The whole
 village is surrounded by farm land and
 forest plantations, so is ideal for   
 starting interesting walks from.      </content>
