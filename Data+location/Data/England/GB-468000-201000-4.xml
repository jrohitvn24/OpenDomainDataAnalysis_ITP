		<title>04Tetsworth C.P. School</title>
		<content>When the population of Tetsworth was at
its greatest the village supported     
several private and church schools. The
only school today, a County Primary,was
built in 1881 by the School Board. The 
building is an attractive Victorian    
design including a school house        
complete with bell tower.              
The older residents of the village     
recount how when they were in the      
school with ninety other children they 
sat in rows, behind desks attending to 
the teacher's Â£talk and chalk'. Today  
there are less than fifty children in  
the school. The emphasis has changed to
meeting the needs of the individual and
equipping them for tomorrow's world.   
As each generation moves towards the   
Secondary School they are encouraged   
to  make some lasting contribution e.g.
garden, playground markings to their   
Primary and truely village school.     </content>
