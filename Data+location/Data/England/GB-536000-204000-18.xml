		<title>18The New River</title>
		<content> The New River was 'started' in 1609 by
 Sir Hugh Myddleton. The river was not 
 built by machinery but by hand and it 
 was lined with clay. It took 4 years  
 to complete and the idea was to bring 
 a water supply to the City of London. 
                                       
 Thames Water Authority maintain the   
 banks of the river. Chemicals have    
 been used in the past and these have  
 unfortunately destroyed some of the   
 fish. Tractors are too large to work  
 on the banks so the grass is trimmed  
 by hand. The cut grass floats         
 downstream to Turnford where it is    
 stopped by lorries and taken away.    
                                       
 The New River is a well-known feature 
 in this area and is still supplying   
 water to London
