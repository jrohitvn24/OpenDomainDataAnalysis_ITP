		<content>The village of Collingtree gets itÂ£s   
name from CollaÂ£s tree,Colla being an  
abreviation of St. Collumba to whom the
parish church is dedicated.The villages
 Collingtree and Milton Malsor were at 
one time one parish and part of the    
estate of Sir Roger Wake.Sir Roger Wake
fought for King Richard III at the     
Battle of Bosworth and as a result of  
supporting the losing side had all his 
estates confiscated.Sir RogerÂ£s grave  
cabe found in the nearby church at     
Blisworth.Later the lands were restored
to the family and their descendants now
own the neighbouring Courteenhall      
Estate.During the 19th. century much of
Collingtree was owned by the Phipps    
family who made their wealth from the  
local brewery.This family made many    
gifts to the village including the     
founding of the school.
