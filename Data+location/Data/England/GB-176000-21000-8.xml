 There seemed to be more children in   
 the village when I was young because  
 the cottages were built for fishermen 
 and quarrymen.  Now they seem to be   
 lived in by families whose children   
 have grown up.  I have recently been  
 injured in a quarry accident and enjoy
 sitting during my convalescence       
 looking at the view of the sea and the
 countryside.  I enjoy watching the    
 sporting activities the sea brings.   
 We have a lovely view from our home   
 half way up the hill.  It is quiet    
 here.  Life has meant hard work but I 
 have been very happy and would never  
 like to move.  It is my home.
