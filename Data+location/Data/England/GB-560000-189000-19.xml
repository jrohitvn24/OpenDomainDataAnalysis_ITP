		<title>19THE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> PC Cooper is our Community Beat Police
 Officer. He has special responsibility
 for policing an area that covers part 
 of Warley, including our school, and  
 Childerditch. His job is to prevent   
 crime, but if a crime is committed he 
 will try his best to catch the        
 offenders. The types of crime he has  
 to deal with normally are only minor, 
 but at holiday times and Christmas    
 there is a rise in Burglary and Theft,
 and he is kept quite busy.            
  In the rural area of Childerditch the
 main problem has been stray dogs      
 worrying and even attacking the farm  
 animals. When the dogs are caught they
 have to be destroyed.                 
  To get around his 'beat' PC Cooper   
 uses a patrol car.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
