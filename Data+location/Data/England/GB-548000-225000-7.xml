		<content>{* playing 40.40 *}About 12 people     
 play. We dip to find out who is going 
 to count and they count up to 50      
 slowly in 1s with their eyes shut, but
 first they must say 'no force around  
 me above me or below me 40.40 scatt'. 
 When they have finished counting they 
 come and look for the rest. They must 
 go about 12 feet away from post, which
 could be a dustbin or a fence. When   
 they have seen someone they must say  
 '40.40 I see-' whoever they see, where
 they see them and point, they must be 
 touching post when saying anything. If
 they say they see someone but got it  
 wrong they have to count again. If    
 they do not come more than 12 feet    
 away from post they are laying eggs   
 and must count again. The last person 
 must try to save the rest by saying   
 '40.40 save all'. If you are not last 
 you must say '40.40 save myself'.     </content>
