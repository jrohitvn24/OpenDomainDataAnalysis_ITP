		<title>16COMMUNITY COUNCIL ACTIVITIES</title>
		<content>                                       
The Community Council helps the village
a lot.  They organise Car Boot Sales on
the playing field and they run a       
Fifty-Fifty shop.  They also arrange   
dances, discos, barbeques and things   
like that.  There is a monthly         
newsletter which gives all the news    
from organisations in the village.  A  
lot of events are held in the village  
hall or the old school room.  Two of   
the biggest  things they have run this 
year is the Mini-Marathon and May      
Fayre.  All the money that has been    
raised is to be used for the new       
Community Centre which will be built   
together with the new school.          
THE MAY FAYRE                          
On the first bank holiday in May,      
Mendlesham holds a street fayre.       
One of the main village roads is closed
and flags are hung from house to house.</content>
