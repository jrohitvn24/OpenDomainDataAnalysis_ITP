		<title>18SHOPS IN BACKWELL</title>
		<content> There are forty shops in Backwell.They
 are central,but over a mile from the  
 furthest edges of the village.Many    
 people use cars to go shopping.There  
 are the normal village shops:_food,   
 haberdashery,post office,D.I.Y.and    
 also "Equicraft"selling equipment for 
 horse_lovers.                         
 A lot of the villagers think there are
 not enough parking areas.There two    
 parking places which are narrow and   
 there is not much space to get in and 
 out.                                  
 The locals travel either to Bristol,  
 Nailsea, Weston, this is to do the    
 main shopping e.g. clothes or         
 furniture.                            
  Bus and train services run to these  
 towns. The station is very small and  
 it costs about Â£1.10 return to        
 Bristol.                              
                                       </content>
