		<title>14TRAFFIC COUNTS</title>
		<content> We conducted two counts outside our   
 School, one on a weekday and one on a 
 Saturday.                             
 On the Thursday morning, 96 cars went 
 by, two buses, a mobile bank, two     
 bicycles and two foreign cars. We     
 noticed that 22 cars went by twice.   
 The registration numbers we collected 
 showed that people come from all over 
 the country to Robin Hoods Bay.       
 In the afternoon 106 cars went by, two
 motorbikes, three vans, one taxi, two 
 buses, two foreign cars and one       
 tractor.                              
 On the Saturday morning we saw a car  
 from Oman in Saudi Arabia. The        
 registration number was written in    
 Arabic. In the afternoon 96 English   
 cars went by, two foreign cars and one
 motorbike. The total number of cars   
 for the day was very much the same as 
 the weekday.                          </content>
