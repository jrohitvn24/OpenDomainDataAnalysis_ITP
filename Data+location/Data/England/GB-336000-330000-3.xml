		<title>03Relief &amp; soils of Hordley</title>
		<content>  The area is flat or gently undulating
 with  the southern part mostly flat at
 about 80m.OD.A low ridge runs west and
 south east  from  Hordley  which rises
 about 17m. above the flatlands. To the
 north of the canal the land rises to a
 height of 148m.just outside our area. 
  Some 16000 years  ago the upland zone
 was the  margin of an ice sheet and is
 part of a terminal moraine belt across
 North Shropshire.The debris is derived
 largely  from  soft red sandstones and
 gives  rise to  deep  soils  that  are
 favourable to farming.To the south the
 soils  are  more recent and consist of
 peats and silts. The  silts are linked
 with the River Perry  while the  peats
 were associated with a lake  extending
 down to Ruyton. These peats  gave rise
 to a zone of wetlands at Tetchill Moor
 and  along  the  Perry valley south of
 our area.                             </content>
