		<content> Five parishes meet in this mainly flat
 agricultural area:{West Chiltington,  
{Pulborough, Billingshurst, Shipley}and
{Thakeham.}In the centre is the hamlet 
 of{Broadford Bridge; Coolham}village  
 lies beyond the northeast. The highest
 point is 146ft in the northwest.      
 This is real Wealden farming country  
 on lush grassland. Most of the farms  
 have small pedigree herds of dairy or 
 beef cattle. Oak trees and hedges line
 every road, track and field, and are  
 the dominant features of the area,    
 together with many fine farmhouses and
 barns dating from the 15th century.   
 Small woods and coppices are almost   
 entirely deciduous. A line of springs 
 runs out where the Lower Greensand    
 ridge in the south meets the heavy    
 clay, and streams or ditches criss-   
 cross the area. There are no schools, 
 churches, or shops in this area.      </content>
