		<title>02Housing, Great Orton</title>
		<content> Originally an iron chain went across  
 the adjoining road and was locked     
 every night. This was a defence       
 against the invasion of the Scots of  
 moss troopers. Once the village had   
 its own pond but this has now been    
 filled in and is used as a childrens' 
 play area. Great Orton is a long,     
 pleasant village with houses placed   
 mainly along both sides of the main   
 road. There are 3 small housing       
 estates. The Main Fauld estate is     
 situated on the outskirts of the      
 village and consists of 6 semi-       
 detached houses built towards the end 
 of the 1939-45 war. These have        
 recently been modernised. The Custy   
 Steps estate was built 1958-9. It is  
 situated in the centre of the village 
 and is shaped like a semi-circle.There
 is a large grassy area in front of the
 houses.                               </content>
