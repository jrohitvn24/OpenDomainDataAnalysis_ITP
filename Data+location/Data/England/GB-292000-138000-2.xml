		<title>02A Farmer's Day.</title>
		<content> Mr. Schofield of North Hawkwell Farm  
 gets up in the morning at half past   
 seven. In the summer he looks at his  
 sheep and then he has his breakfast.  
 Then he sees the cows and does his    
 silage or hay making. After that he   
 has dinner and goes and does his      
 silage or hay again.                  
                                       
 In the winter Mr. Schofield gets up at
 half past seven and feeds his sheep,  
 has his breakfast and feeds his cows  
 and does odd jobs around the farm     
 like hedging for example. He has his  
 dinner and then carries on with the   
 odd jobs. He feeds his cows and sheep 
 again at eight o'clock.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
