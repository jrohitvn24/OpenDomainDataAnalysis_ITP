   At school we play cricket,rounders, 
    football, hockey and rugby. We play
    hockey indoors and its called floor
    hockey but it's quite like normal  
    or ice hockey.When we play cricket 
    we can play by two different sets  
    of rules.In one game you start at {
{   200}and lose {6} each time you're  
    out but you still bat for limited  
    amount of overs.In the other game  
    you start at nought and lose {1}run
    each time you're out,but you still 
    stay in.                           
             {Games at home            
{                                      
{  }At home I play on my computer. My  
    best game is {DUKES OF HAZZARD.}I  
    also play chase on my{B.M.X.bike.} 
 My dad and I play snooker and darts.
