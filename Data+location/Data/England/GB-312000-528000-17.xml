		<title>17Matters of Concern</title>
		<content> There is concern about changes and    
 development of buildings in Main      
 Street, Cockermouth particularly.     
 Old-established 'traditional'         
 businesses are being replaced by      
 Building Societies, Banks and Travel  
 Agencies. The new County Fire Service 
 Headquarters on the old Railway       
 Station site has taken valuable       
 car-parking space. A footpath along   
 the line of the disused railway has   
 been blocked by the filling-in of a   
 cutting below a bridge at Fern Bank,  
 causing strong public protest.        
 Many people are concerned about the   
 number of dogs running loose in the   
 town and housing estates with the     
 consequent danger to children         
 particularly. Graffiti and litter     
 on public and private property is     
 a continuing source of public concern.
