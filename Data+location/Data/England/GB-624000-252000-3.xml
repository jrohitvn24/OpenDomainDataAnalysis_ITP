		<content>     Bredfield Primary School is a     
small village school with twenty six   
pupils altogether. There are two full  
time teachers and one working part-time
for a Wednesday morning each week. The 
school has two classrooms, a Portacabin
office, a canteen where the meals are  
cooked and outbuildings for storage.   
     There are two playgrounds, one in 
front of the building and one behind,  
which leads to the village playing     
field, where the pupils can play.      
     In the summer on the back         
playground a trainer swimming pool is  
put up. It is five metres long by two  
and a half metres wide and is about    
eighty centimetres deep. If it is warm 
enough the children swim every day.    
     The Education Authority wishes to 
close the school in July, 1986, but    
everyone in the village wants it to    
stay open.                             </content>
