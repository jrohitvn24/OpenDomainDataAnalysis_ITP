		<title>17St. John's Church.</title>
		<content>   The parish of st. John's at Whorlton
 is a team church with St. Wilfred at  
 Newbiggin Hall and Holy Nativity at   
 Chapel House.                         
   There are about 21,000 people in the
 parish.  The church is built of stone 
 and there is a bell tower.  The bell  
 has fallen down but it used to ring to
 call people to service.  The church   
 roof is made of tiles.                
   The vicar lives in the vicarage     
 which is beside the church.  Next to  
 the church there is Church Cottage and
 next to it is the Church Hall where my
 sister goes to Sunday School.         
 Sometimes the mummies meet there and  
 they also use the hall as a Polling   
 Station on election day.  The Brownies
 and Guides use the hall too.
