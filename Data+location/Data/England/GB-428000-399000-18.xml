		<content> Crane Moor school was built in 1873and
 the school house which is now part of 
 the school in 1877. At first it was an
 infant school but now it is a Junior  
 and Infant School.It was run by the   
 church but now Barnsley Metropolitan  
 Borough Council run it. Atthe end of  
 August 1985 it will close because     
 we only have 27 children in the       
 village,and only a few babies. Our    
 last day at school will be 16th July  
 then in September we will go by bus to
 either Wortley or Thurgoland schools. 
 Our school has a headteacher, two     
 teachers,a non-teaching assistant who 
 is also the secretary,a cleaner and   
 two dinner ladies.
