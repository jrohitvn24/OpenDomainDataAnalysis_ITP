		<title>11White Lady,Sherburn-in-Elmet</title>
		<content> There was once a man and a woman and  
 they were just going to get married.  
 They were driving along in a carriage,
 something frightened the horse,perhaps
 a rabbit or a weasel.The horse bolted 
 and the lady fell out of the carriage 
 into the pond and drowned.She is      
 called the White Lady because she was 
 all dressed in white.It is said if you
 go round the pond twice and get dizzy 
 not to go round the third time because
 the White Lady's hand will come out   
 and grab you by the ankle and pull you
 in.                                   
{Sherburn-in-Elmet Church under attack.
 Many years ago there were some monks  
 under attack at Sherburn Church.5 or 6
 of them made a plan to escape.They got
 spades and dug each night until they  
 got to Huddlestone Hall.When they got 
 there they celebrated with cheese and 
 bread,later leaving for another Church</content>
