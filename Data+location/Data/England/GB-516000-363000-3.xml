		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY-THE SPA</title>
		<content> A spa is a place where people go to   
 drink or bathe in water which has     
 special mineral qualities.            
 John Parkinson accidentally discovered
 the spring at Woodhall in the late    
 nineteenth century while looking for  
 coal.Soon a village was built and it  
 became a very popular place with some 
 notable hotels.Places of entertainment
 such as the cinema and the park were  
 built.Many of the visitors to the spa 
 were people suffering from illnesses, 
 especially the elderly.They thought   
 that if they bathed in the water or   
 drank it they would soon get better.  
 Today the spa baths have closed down  
 due to the recent collapse of part of 
 their structure.
