		<content> Dad got some pop and chewing gum.Then 
 we looked for the man who signed the  
 paper.But we could not find him.For   
 dinner I had ham sandwiches,yoghurt   
 and some chewing gum.We had to wait   
 for half an hour.Then we set off for  
 Tillicoultry with some steel.When we  
 got there the man was waiting for     
 us.We tipped the steel.Then we went   
 to Dundee across the Tay bridge.We    
 went to this place where they make bed
 sheets.We loaded them up.Then we went 
 to Ridgeways and I sat on top of the  
 load while they loaded some more on to
 it.Dad,Keith and John sheeted the     
 wagon up and we went to the truck stop
 for Supper I had chips and sausage    
 followed by trifle.Dad and I had two  
 games of Pool.Then I had a drink of   
 coke and went to bed in the cab.
