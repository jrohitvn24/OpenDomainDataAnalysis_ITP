		<content>      Although inevitably in a largely 
 rural community the number of clubs is
 limited.Those that exist are well     
 supported and in addition a number of 
 people supported outside organisations
 such as the N.S.P.C.C. and the        
 R.S.P.B. {JUNIORS.}Some children were 
 members of the scout movement or the  
 cubs and brownies all based in Lazenby
 .{SOCIAL.}The focal point of the      
 village of Lazenby is the Social club,
 a club which offers the usual         
 facilities of a working mens club :_  
 snooker,darts,dominoes,cards and the  
 ancient game of quoits,which has had a
 recent upsurge in popularity.{SPORTS.}
 Wilton golf club is an eighteen hole  
 course.It has excellent social        
 facilities and is very popular with   
 I.C.I. employees who receive cheap    
 membership as I.C.I. own the club.
