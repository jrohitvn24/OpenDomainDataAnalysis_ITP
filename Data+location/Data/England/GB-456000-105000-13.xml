		<content>           The nearest airport is at   
 Eastleigh some ten miles away,but     
 reached very quickly by the new M27   
 motorway which was completed last     
 year.With access at each end of the   
 town the motorway serves to speed up  
 deliveries both too and from the town.
           Bus services are adequate   
 and run from the bus station in the   
 centre of the town.Coaches run from   
 here to the various destinations      
 throughout the country and the costs  
 work out very reasonably especially in
 comparison with the railway.          
           Various by-passes which have
 been and are being built,keep most of 
 the traffic out of the town           
 itself.Many parks have been built for 
 cars and although there are several   
 thousand individual car billets there 
 never seem to be enough.
