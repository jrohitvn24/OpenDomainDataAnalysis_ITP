		<content>     There are 5 old parish churches, 2
of which are now in Oxford and 3 in    
surrounding villages.                  
     The church of St. Mary the Virgin 
in Iffley was built 900 years ago.     
Its splendid Norman architecture       
attracts many visitors from all over   
the world.   There are also Norman     
features at the Church of St. Andrew,  
in Sandford, which was founded in ll00.
The church of St. James in Cowley dates
from the early eighteenth century.     
St. Mary and St. Nicholas' Church at   
Littlemore was founded by John Henry   
Newman in l836.   Today it stands as a 
living memorial to the Oxford Movement:
the focus of worship is the l0.00 a.m. 
Parish Mass.   There are two churches  
on the same site in Kennington         
dedicated to St. Swithun.   A Norman   
church which is no longer used has a   
modern church beside it.               </content>
