 People at Lydbrook walked to Joys     
 Green to school as Lydbrook School was
 not built.There were 7 teachers and a 
 headmaster.The cane was used.The      
 school was spotless.The girls walked  
 to Lydbrook for cookery classes.Things
 were cheap,1penny worth of sweets was 
 equal to 30p today.They used to play  
 "Hen &amp; Chicks".She did knitting and   
 sewed rag dolls.There are only 3      
 teachers in our school today.The cane 
 is never used and we have a           
 headmistress. The boys and girls do   
 sewing and cooking.Mrs.Freeman likes  
 to arrange  flowers.She goes to a     
 club for the elderly called the       
 "Autumn Leaves".They go to places like
 Cardiff and Jersey.                   </content>
