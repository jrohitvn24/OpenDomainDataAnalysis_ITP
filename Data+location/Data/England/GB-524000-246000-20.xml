		<content>     Sarah Dazely of Wrestlingworth was
 the last woman to be publicaly hanged 
 in Bedfordshire. This took place in   
 1843. She murdered two husbands by    
 poisoning their rice pudding. This    
 became public knowledge when she fed a
 pudding to the pigs and they died.    
     Her execution was commemorated by 
 the sale of lace bobbins as was the   
 custom in those days
