		<content>   The various clubs and activities in 
 Cheddleton are the main inspiration   
 behind the many special events.       
 Recently a 'Cheddleton Remembers'     
 evening at St. Edwards Church when old
 photographs and films were displayed. 
 A flower festival held in 1984 raised 
 Â£1000 for St. Edwards Church funds. A 
 carnival is held yearly to raise money
 for local charities with Carnival     
 Queen, float competitions and side    
 shows.                                
   A concert was given bi-annually by  
 the Corn Dollies in St. Edwards       
 hospital a proportion of the proceeds 
 being donated to the hospital in      
 return for the use of their facilities
   At Christmas a special Santa Claus  
 train runs at he Cheddleton Railway   
 Museum. In the summer the Salvation   
 Army hold an open air service at the  
 canalside.                            </content>
