		<title>14A comparison of two farms</title>
		<content> Poplar Farm is a fruit farm with a    
 little arable acreage and only has the
 farmer and his son working on it. It  
 consists of 212 acres, growing        
 strawberries, raspberries,            
 gooseberries, blackcurrants, potatoes,
 wheat and barley. The barley and wheat
 are used for cereals. His main        
 equipment is a combine harvester with 
 a couple of tractors and attachments. 
 All servicing and repairs are done on 
 the farm limiting their time out of   
 use. At the end of the summer he      
 starts to breed turkeys for Christmas.
 They are housed in a large round pen  
 and when big enough are allowed to    
 roam around the whole shed.Battery    
 techniques are used to give a better  
 return on the birds.
