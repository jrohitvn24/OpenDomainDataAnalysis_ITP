		<title>12Farming Then and Now</title>
		<content> Farming in Burton was a lot different 
 in 1939.The crops were different they 
 were mainly root crops.Before the war 
 the work was done by horse drawn cart 
 implements such as a Binder(to cut the
 corn)but a Combined Harvester does it 
 now.Modern machinery is much larger   
 but it only needs one person to       
 operate it.A Sugar Beet Harvester     
 lifts,trims and drops the beet into   
 the trailer.The old fashioned way     
 required a large work force and quite 
 a number of operations picking,carting
 off,putting in a clamp and            
 bagging.There were lots of special    
 jobs such as thatching the stack-no   
 need now.Not so many workers are      
 needed to operate the machines .In the
 old times each worker had a piglet to 
 feed and fatten up.Today computers    
 help some farmers to plan out         
 crops,before  the war they used paper.</content>
