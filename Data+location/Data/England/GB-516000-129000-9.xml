		<title>09LEISURE AND RECREATION</title>
		<content> People were given a questionaire about
 their recreation time. The results are
 summarized below. The most popular    
 recreation centre was Horsham Swimming
 Centre followed by the Arts Centre:   
 most leisure time was spent at home   
 using home computers and televison.   
 Televison is the most popular with    
 videos becoming increasingly popular. 
 Few people visited the cinema. People 
 felt they had less leisure time than  
 in the past; about two hours per day  
 on average. Joining clubs was more    
 popular with children than adults.    
 Computer games have largely replaced  
 board games in the home. Reading is   
 popular in many forms e.g.books       
 Ceefax, Oracle, magazines and         
 newspapers. When asked how many books 
 they read in a month, a popular answer
 was 4 from adults and 2 from children.
