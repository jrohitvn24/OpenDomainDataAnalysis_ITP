		<title>07WORKING MEN'S CLUB, WALL</title>
		<content>  The Working Men's Club or Village    
Hall, as it is now more often called,  
in Wall was built in 1908.             
  It was given to the men by a local   
benefactor. The annual rent paid was   
two guineas and conditions included    
"No alcohol" and "No politics". If the 
Club was not used it was to be turned  
into cottages. The hall was used for   
war effort, sewing etc. and by the     
Women's Institute from 1912. It is used
regularly today - snooker and darts for
men, handicraft classes for women and  
weekly Whist Drives. Wedding           
receptions, parties and dances are also
held in the hall and the W.I. use it   
for their monthly meetings. After much 
fund-raising by the villagers a large  
kitchen extension was built in 1984    
which greatly improved the facilities. 
  The original conditions relating to  
alcohol and politics no longer apply.  </content>
