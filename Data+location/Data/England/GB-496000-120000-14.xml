		<title>14Petworth Ethiopia Appeal</title>
		<content> Petworth Ethiopia is a famine relief  
 fund organised by Petworth Christian  
 Fellowship. Different organisations in
 the town have come together to try and
 save the Ethiopians. It started in    
 November 1984 when a group of people  
 met to pray about what they should do.
 The peolpe who helped to save for     
 Ethiopia raised Â£4800 to buy grain.   
 They raised it by doing the following 
 - sponsored slim, silence, walk and   
 skip. Also they organised coffee      
 mornings, piano tuning, making dolls  
 clothes and selling song cassettes    
 which they had made. On Tuesday 16th  
 April 1985 the grain left Petworth.   
 The 46 tonnes were contained in over  
 900 sacks.
