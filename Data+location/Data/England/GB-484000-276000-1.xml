Kettering was first named Cytringan.In 
the Domesday Book of 1086 it is        
recorded as Cateringe.The village      
became a town in 1227 when Kettering   
was granted the right to have a market.
In 1792 a group led by Andrew Fuller   
launched the Baptist Missionary Society
from the town.William Knibb was born in
the town in 1803.He was a Baptist      
Missionary and became famous for his   
work to abolish slavery.With the       
opening of the Railway in 1857         
Kettering's Boot &amp; Shoe Trade began to 
develop although this has declined in  
recent years.Kettering's town centre   
has undergone a transformation,        
Victorian buildings have been          
demolished to make way for the         
Newborough Centre.Phases 1&amp;2 have been 
completed.Kettering is also the home of
Wicksteed Park,a popular leisure park. </content>
