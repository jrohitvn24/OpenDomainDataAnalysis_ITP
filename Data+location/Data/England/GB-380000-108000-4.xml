 During the summer you can see a lot of
 swallows and house martins in the     
 villages and hamlets in the area.     
 There are a lot of streams and they   
 support a lot of insect life which    
 probably attracts them.               
                                       
 There are some interesting chalk hills
 around Okeford Fitzpaine, like Okeford
 Hill, which support special kinds of  
 flowers and insect life.  We have seen
 species of orchids up on the hill.    
                                       
 Occasionally, you may glimpse a deer  
 in the area although they are very    
 timid creatures and are rarely seen.  
 However, they cause considerable      
 damage to trees and crops.
