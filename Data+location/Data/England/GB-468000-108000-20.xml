		<title>20DUNSBURY HILL FARM</title>
		<content> Dunsbury Hill Farm was probably built 
 about 1830 because a brick on a wall  
 of an outhouse records this as 1839   
 but the outhouse could have been a    
 later extention. The hill itself was  
 mentioned in the Domesday Book.       
 The farm covers 200 acres but 20 acres
 were lost when the M3 Motorway was    
 built. The farm is made up of ten     
 major buildings the house and other   
 various store's.                      
 No crops are grown and the grass is   
 used for grazing and for hay mayking. 
 The main part of the live stock is the
 cattle but chickens and ducks are also
 raised probably only for fresh eggs.  
 The cows (there are 150 to 200 of them
 atany one time)are taken to market    
 4 or 5 perday during two 4 week       
 periods in July and December.Each cow 
 can fetch up to Â£500 .
