		<content>Our school day began at 9.00 a.m. in   
1930. We had morning break at 11.00 to 
11.15 a.m., when we had milk. We were  
sent home at 12 noon for our dinner    
unless it was too far to walk. School  
recommenced at 1.15 p.m.. Afternoon    
break was from 2.15 to 2.30 p.m. and we
went home at 3.25 p.m.. The day started
with prayers and a Scripture lesson. We
had Sums, Drill (P.E.), History,       
English and Reading.                   
  In the afternoon girls were taught to
sew, wash and iron clothes. Boys       
learned gardening and woodwork.        
    Punishments were a soap pill or the
cane. There were examinations for the  
Bishop's Prize. If we won a scholarship
at 10 years old we would have to walk  
to Bletchington Station (2 miles) to   
catch the train into Oxford.           
This was our life style then.
