		<content> NEWLANDS IS OWNED AND FARMED BY BASIL 
 BAIRD.  THE FARM IS SITUATED ALONG    
 TANNERS LAND, A PRIVATE ROAD, OFF     
 NEWGATE LANE AND RUNS ALONG THE       
 BOUNDARY OF H.M.S. COLLINGWOOD.  THE  
 WORKFORCE IS SMALL.  WHEAT, RAPE AND  
 POTATOES ARE CULTIVATED ON A ROTATION 
 SYSTEM.  THE FARM IS BEST KNOWN FOR   
 ITS PIGS.  THESE ARE REARED,          
 SLAUGHTERED AND THEN SOLD IN THE FARM 
 SHOP.  OTHER MEAT SOLD IN THE FARM    
 SHOP IS BOUGHT IN FROM A WHOLESALER.  
 THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS FROM  
 LOCAL RESIDENTS ABOUT THE SMELL FROM  
 THE PIGGERY.
