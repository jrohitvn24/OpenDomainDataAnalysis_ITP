		<title>19Social Concerns in Langho 1</title>
		<content>    Unemployment around Langho and     
Wilpshire is a major social concern .  
Employment among the middle-age group  
is fairly stable though bankrupcy is   
sadly becoming more frequent . Children
leaving school or collage have great   
difficulty finding employment which    
leaves them prey to another great      
problem : drugs .                      
    Parents in the area fear the       
possibility of their children taking   
drugs more than any other evil . Police
warnings that nearby Blackburn is a    
hot-bed of drug activity puts parents  
on their guard but they are frustrated 
by their real difficulties in          
perceiving how to combat the threat .
