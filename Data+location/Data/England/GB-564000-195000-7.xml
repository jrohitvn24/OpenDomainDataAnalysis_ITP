   Most people have private cars. In   
 this part of Billericay there are two 
{service stations.}Both had petrol     
 pumps and they can also supply parts  
 for modern cars. One garage is        
 opposite the station and the other is 
 situated in the middle of the         
 industrail estate. Both do M.O.T.     
 testing.                              
   There are two{car parks}for people  
 who use the railway. One of the car   
 parks could only be entered by season 
 ticket holders. The other one costs   
 money to enter. By the side of every  
 factory unit there is a small private 
 car park. Lake Meadows has one main   
 car park and several smaller ones.
