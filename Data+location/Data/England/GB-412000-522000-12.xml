		<title>12Cockfield Fell 2. Stints.</title>
		<content> In 1865 The Fell was made a regulated 
 pasture with the freeholders at that  
 time being allocated grazing rights.  
 The administration of The Fell rests  
 with a group of  Field Reeves who are 
 appointed by the present stint        
 holders.A Stint is a document giving  
 grazing rights on The Fell.There are  
 1100 stints altogether.Originally 1   
 stint gave the right to graze 1 beast,
 3 horses or 8 sheep.Today the stints  
 seem to give more general rights.Some 
 stint holders have pigeon lofts or    
 other small buildings on The Fell.    
   No animals are allowed to graze on  
 The Fell in April in order that the   
 grass may grow.The River Gaunless     
 flows across The Fell providing       
 swimming,fishing and other water      
 pleasures for local children.
