		<content>   Groups of older semi-detached houses
 built in the nineteen thirties by the 
 local council each have their own     
 front and back garden.                
   More recent housing development in  
 the area includes twenty five detached
 bungalows at Rushyford (half a mile   
 south of Chilton) and a residential   
 estate of mixed detached houses, semi-
 detached houses and bungalows         
 completed within the last year and    
 sited in the N.E. corner of Chilton.  
   The hamlet of Bradbury, two miles   
 east of Chilton, has a mixture of     
 properties ranging from renovated old 
 farm cottages to more contemporary    
 buildings set in rural surroundings.  
   The largest single house in the area
 is Chilton Hall, which having once    
 served among other things as a tramps'
 hostel, is now, once again, an        
 imposing dwelling house.              </content>
