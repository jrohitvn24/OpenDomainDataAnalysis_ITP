		<title>10The Woodland and Animals</title>
		<content> There are many trees in our area.Most 
 are in woods but there are many in    
 fields and along hedgerows.The        
 Godinton Park estate surrounding the  
 house is traditional parkland,of      
 pasture with scattered trees and areas
 of woodland.The most common trees are 
 oak,ash,horse chestnut,alder,hawthorn 
 and elm.These are all deciduous trees 
 but some coniferous trees have been   
 planted.                              
 Most of the wild animals live in the  
 woods because there is plenty of      
 cover.We saw a lot of action with the 
 small mammals running away,such as    
 field mice,rabbits and squirrels.There
 are also foxes.We have a few pets like
 cats and dogs.The farm animals are    
 mostly sheep and cattle.This area has 
 good pasture for farm animals and     
 plenty of food and cover for wild     
 amimals.                              </content>
