 to have breakfast which is usually    
 cereal. I go and wash and put on my   
 school uniform, then I go to catch the
 bus. When I get to school my friend   
 and I join assembly where all the     
 classes say prayers and sing hymns    
 together. After I do Maths. At 10.30  
 it is playtime when we have a break   
 from work. Then I do S.R.A. where we  
 read a story and answer several       
 questions. After S.R.A. we have lunch,
 children may bring their own lunch or
