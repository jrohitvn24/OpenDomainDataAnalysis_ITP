		<content>{Tig.}The game is played by a group of 
 children.One person has to be on.The  
 people have a den.The person that is  
 on stays by the den.The people on the 
 den try to get off.If the person      
 "tigs" someone by touching them he is 
 on.Those caught run after more        
 people.They run and run until all of  
 the people are tigged.                
{Akey 1.2.3.}Our Akey post is a lamp   
 post.Whoever is on has to count to 100
 while all the other people go and     
 hide.If the person that is on does not
 want to be on again you can say "No   
 fools around me."The person who is on 
 have to find the people who have      
 hidden.When he or she has found       
 someone they have to run back to the  
 post and shout "Akey 1.2.3."The last  
 one has to try to find the first one  
 so that the other person is on again.
