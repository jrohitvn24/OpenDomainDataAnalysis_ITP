		<content> produced a year.The manager decides   
 the cropping and what they buy and he 
 gives the foreman his instructions. He
 is also responsible for selling the   
 crops.A new grain store is being built
 to hold 1,000 tons of extra produce if
 they were ever in trouble,which will  
 cost 60,000 pounds.Many buildings have
 been demolished as agriculture is     
 always changing.The Berkhamsted bypass
 which is being built will cut right   
 through the farmland and will cut off 
 the main house from many good parts of
 the farm.Many new buildings have been 
 made so Rossway can compete with the  
 rest of the country in the            
 agricultural market.There are many    
 footpaths in and around the farm but  
 they still find people trespassing    
 where there are no footpaths.
