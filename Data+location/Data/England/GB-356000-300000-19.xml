		<content>   Owing to the fact that many people  
  are involved in farming within this  
 area and farming being a full-time,   
 all season occupation little time is  
 left for hobbies.                     
   One gentleman plays the bagpipes and
 this seemed to be the only person     
 actively in musical pursuits.  A lady 
 at Woodside Cottages grows, dries and 
 arrangesflowers - often placing them  
 upon graves.                          
   All hobbies seem to be centred round
 the home and no selling takes place.  
 These hobbies include knitting,       
 cookery, gardening and painting.      
 There are no facilities in the area   
 for arts and crafts.  The nearest     
 place would appear to be Shrewsbury in
 this respect.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
