		<title>03GAMES WE PLAY IN CLIFTON.</title>
		<content> Once upon a time I was playing with my
 friend and we went into his bedroom to
 talk about dinosaurs. I have got a    
 book about dinosaurs and it shows you 
 how the world began,and goes on to    
 amphibians and reptiles.When we have  
 finished talking, we go back outside  
 to play.                              
   I also hold a club in my bedroom    
 about aeroplanes and the airforce. I  
 have my friends in my bedroom and I   
 have asked them to bring airforce     
 books in.We have our own pads and     
 pencils, and write about things which 
 fly in the sky, such as helicopters,  
 aeroplanes, hot-air balloons...in     
 fact, all kinds of flying objects.    
 When we have done that, we play at    
 armies outside,altogether. When we are
 fed up with this, we play on Simon's  
 climbing frame until dinner-time.
