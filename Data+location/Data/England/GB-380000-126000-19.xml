		<title>19SCHOOL AND PLAY; GILLINGHAM</title>
		<content> Before the war there were four{schools
 in Gillingham; an infant school       
 opposite the Post Office at Wyke, a   
 grammar school and a secondary modern 
 school.  The latter two schools were  
 combined to form the present          
 comprehensive school in 1959.         
                                       
 The main{entertainment}in the 1940's  
 was the cinema, followed by dances    
 held in the dance hall in Station     
 Road.  Nowadays there are discos and  
 the Youth Club, which was built on the
 site of the old Drill Hall.  The      
 Social Centre, next to the school,    
 also provides{recreation. }The        
 Coronation Club in Station Road used  
 to be a Liberal Club before being     
 turned into a Workingman's Club.
