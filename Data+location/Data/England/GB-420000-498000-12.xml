		<title>12Religion - Brompton on Swale</title>
		<content> Most people in the area are           
 nominally Church of England.There is a
 church in Catterick dedicated to St   
 Anne and St Paul's in Brompton on     
 Swale,which is a chapel of ease for   
 Easby church.There is also a Methodist
 chapel in Brompton and another in     
 Colburn.St Paul's church has Sunday   
 School every Sunday after the morning 
 service. Children from 4-11 attend    
 these classes.The church also has a   
 Mothers Union.There is a Monday Club  
 which uses the Methodist Chapel. At   
 Monday Club we sing songs,play games  
 and read the bible.The members        
 of Monday Club are children aged 5-11.
 There used to be a youth club for     
 teenagers and children but it is no   
 longer running.The new C.of E. primary
 school in Brompton-on-Swale opened in 
 1983.The old school has recently      
 become a church hall again.           </content>
