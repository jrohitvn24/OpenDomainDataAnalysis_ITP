		<content> There are 2 shops in Studham village. 
 "Maisies" is about 200 years old and  
 has always sold a variety of goods.   
 Today Maisies sells sweets, tobacco,  
 toys and newspapers.                  
 "Studham Stores and Post Office" is   
 opposite Maisies and sells a range of 
 food products. It is one of the oldest
 buildings in Studham and still has the
 well where the village people used to 
 come for their water.                 
 It was also the village bakehouse and 
 has a large bread oven at the back.   
 The shops are well used and are an    
 important focus for the village.      
 Barwythe Hall rebuilt and enlarged in 
 1849 was originally the Manor House   
 but in 1977 became the offices of     
 Bierrum's a company which designs and 
 builds industrial chimneys for home   
 and overseas markets.
