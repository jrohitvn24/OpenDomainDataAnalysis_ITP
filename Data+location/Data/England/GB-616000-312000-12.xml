		<content>      The landscape of the area falls  
 into 3 broad categories.To the{North  
 of the Fakenham road there lie large  
 fields of{arable farmland,}with many  
 fields given to the growing of sugar  
 beet,an East Anglian feature. To the  
{South}there is the{valley}of the river
 Wensum, surrounded with meadows,some  
 grazing land and the gravel pits at   
{Taverham.}Along the Fakenham road     
 there is the recent housing           
 development, open spaces here being   
 few and far between.Much of the       
{natural habitat}of the area has gone  
 with the introduction of intensive    
 farming methods,but the disused       
 railway line provides a{woodland      
 habitat for many species of tree,     
 plant, animal and bird. The{river     
{valley}is relatively untouched,and the
 area in general has maintained much of
 its original rural character.         </content>
