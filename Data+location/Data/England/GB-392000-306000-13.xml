		<title>13SHARESHILL CHURCH IN l985</title>
		<content>The church of St.Mary and St.Luke in   
the diocese of Lichfield serves the    
parishes of Featherstone,Shareshill,   
Hilton and Saredon.The present vicar   
was inducted on 4th March l985 and     
lives in a modern vicarage at Feather- 
stone.The original Tudor vicarage next 
door to the church was sold in July    
l984.The congregation has declined over
the years and now consists of 75 people
on the electoral roll,however in       
November l985 2O parishioners will be  
confirmed at St.Michaels Church,       
Penkridge,by a Bishop of the diocese.  
The Sunday School is being reintroduced
and hopefully this upward trend will   
continue.Services are held at lO a.m.  
on Sunday,when an average of 4O men,   
women and children attend worship.Fund-
raising to repair the roof has been    
going on for a number of years.
