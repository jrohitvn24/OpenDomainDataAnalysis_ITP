		<content> The village hall was built in 1924 &amp;  
 is used by many organisations         
 including the Women's Institute, the  
 Young Farmers' Club &amp; the Derby &amp; Joan
 Club.   It is also used for           
 entertainments such as whist drives &amp; 
 bingo &amp; for flower &amp; other shows.     
                                       
 The parish owns its own playing fields
 called Berryfield.   The name is said 
 to have originated from the burial of 
 victims of the plague here.   The     
 field is used for cricket, football,  
 tennis &amp; clay pigeon shooting as well 
 as sports, shows &amp; fetes.             
 The two tennis courts were constructed
 in 1973 &amp; the new pavilion was built  
 in 1976.   In both cases the money was
 raised locally.
