		<content>   Opposite the windmill is the "Prince
 of Wales" public house.It stands on   
 what was once the main London to      
 Colchester road built by the Romans in
 the third century A.D.For hundreds of 
 years the pub was the bakery that took
 its flour from the mill.The pub is    
 supposed to be haunted by a young boy 
 whose hand was cut off for stealing a 
 loaf of bread.During the 19th century 
 the road outside the pub was turnpiked
 and we saw the board with the list of 
 charges.Now that the A12 has been     
 built the road is not so important.   
   Toby Manor is found down a rough    
 track nearby called Laundry Lane.The  
 house was originally two cottages and 
 nuns used to wash clothes for the     
 monks of the priory.In the bathroom is
 a secret room where Roman Catholic    
 priests would hide and under the      
 kitchen is a well which is still used.</content>
