		<title>07The Guidford Show</title>
		<content>    The Guildford Show has been held   
 each year for the past 25 years. It   
 takes a month to prepare and between  
 25,000 and 40,000 people come,        
 depending upon the weather, from all  
 over the country. Much of the Show is 
 concerned with{agriculture.           
    The Show, held at the back of      
 Stoke Park, always begins with a      
 parade of floats, led by the{Carnival 
{Queen}and accompanied by brass and    
 marching bands. A new Carnival Queen  
 is chosen each year to preside over   
 the occasion. She also opens other    
 local fetes during her year of office.
    Over the years the{safety}record of
 the Show has been excellent, with only
 minor injuries and one tent fire. The 
 Show is held to raise money for local 
 charities, Â£3,000 being the most      
 raised so far.
