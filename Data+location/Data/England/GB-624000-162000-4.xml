		<content> The{River Stour}is still markedly     
 tidal here although salt water does   
 not reach this far up. Some species of
 sea fish come up as far as Plucks     
 Gutter, i.e. Bass, Flounders,         
 and Grey Mullet. There is a run of    
 Sea-Trout. Of{Freshwater Fishes}the   
 following are common: Bream, Dace,    
 Eels, Gudgeon, Perch, Pike, Roach,Rudd
 Ruffe or Pope, Brown and Rainbow      
 Trout, Tench. Other species such as   
 Carp, Greyling, Chub, Barbel, and even
 Salmon are sometimes reported. The    
 river bed is home to  very large Fresh
 Water Mussels, and Crayfish are found 
 in the dykes. Otters were common once,
 but none have been seen for 20 years -
 Wild Mink have been encountered. All  
 the common {riverside birds,}Coots,   
 Moorhens, and the like are to be seen,
 and if your lucky, a Kingfisher.
