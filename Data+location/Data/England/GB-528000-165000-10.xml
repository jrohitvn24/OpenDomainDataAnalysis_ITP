		<title>10LOCAL EMPLOYMENT FOR WOMEN</title>
		<content>     There are three main sources of   
employment for women. Many of the jobs 
in the light industrial factories on   
the Purley Way Estate area are done by 
women.  Some factories work flexible   
hours so women can be with their fam-  
ilies.                                 
     There is secretarial work in the  
offices in the London Road.  The main  
office block is the Phillips Building. 
     Many women work in the Mayday and 
Croydon General Hospital complex.      
These are two large general hospitals  
which employ many nurses, office staff,
ward orderlies and cleaners, all on a  
shift system.                          
     The complex also includes the     
Lodge Road Clinics (child health, teeth
and eyes) and St. Mary's Maternity     
Hospital.
