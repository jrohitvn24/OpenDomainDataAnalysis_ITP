		<content> THE WEATHER IN OUR BLOCK IS GENERALLY 
 MILD BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE SOUTHERN   
 PART OF ENGLAND. HOWEVER, BECAUSE WE  
 ARE FAIRLY HIGH (THE HIGHEST PART OF  
 OUR BLOCK IS 120M ABOVE SEA LEVEL)    
 AND THERE IS NO NATURAL PROTECTION    
 FROM THE PREVAILING SOUTH WESTERLY    
 WINDS, WE DO SOMETIMES HAVE SNOW AND  
 THEN WE CAN BE CUT OFF AS WE WERE THIS
 YEAR FOR A WHILE. THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE
 THE LOCAL COUNCIL CAN'T  CLEAR OUR    
 SMALL COUNTRY ROADS. OUR RAINFALL IS  
 THE SAME AS THE AVERAGE RAINFALL FOR  
 SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND OUR  SUNSHINE    
 LEVELS ARE ALSO THOSE OF A TYPICAL    
 SOUTHERN AREA AWAY FROM THE COAST.    
 THIS SUMMER THE WEATHER HAS BEEN VERY 
 WET, LIKE OTHER PLACES IN ENGLAND AND 
 AS A RESULT THE FARMERS HAVE HAD      
 DIFFICULTY IN HARVESTING.             
                                       
                                       </content>
