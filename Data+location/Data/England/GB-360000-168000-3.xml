		<title>03A stream</title>
		<content> The source of the stream is between   
 Old Acre and East Dundry Road.        
 Within our area the stream starts at  
 old bridge and follows the path at the
 bottom of Water Lane. It then carries 
 on through the lane until it branches 
 under Callington Road and alongside   
{West Town Lane School. }              
 In some parts of the stream there is  
 wild life. We found Shrimps, a Worm   
 Leech, a Water Louse and we have seen 
 Sticklebacks.                         
 When the Robertsons jam factory was in
 existence the stream was polluted. It 
 is now less polluted but thick with   
 weed.
