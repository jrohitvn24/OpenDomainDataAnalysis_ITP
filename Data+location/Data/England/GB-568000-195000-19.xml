		<content>   Bonnets farm stocks thousands of    
 chickens every year.When we went they 
 had over{3000}two week old chickens.  
 They have 4 sheds full of chicks and  
 chickens.There were 6 more sheds with 
 about 5000 chickens all laying eggs.  
 In total there were 3456 laying hens. 
 There are over 360 eggs laid each     
 day.They also sell chicken feed,      
 eggs,turkey,chicken and other meats.  
   Bonnet's farm has a light machine   
 and an egg grader.When you put eggs   
 on they go down a conveyer belt where 
 a strong light shows you whether they 
 are cracked or bad.Then they are      
 graded according to weight.
