		<content> The game we play most is called "it". 
 We play it at school every break time.
 We use a drainpipe and a platform for 
 "homes".  There are two people who are
 "it" and the idea is to get from one  
 home to the other without the people  
 who are it "tagging" you.  If you step
 off or let go of the homes then you   
 have got to run to the other home.  If
 the "it" person catches you then you  
 are "it" instead of them.  There are  
 no "touchbacks" or "guarding".  The   
 people who are "it" cannot touch the  
 person who has just touched them until
 they have been on a home.  Anyone on a
 home is safe and cannot be tagged.    
 The "it" people have to stand behind a
 certain line depending on which home  
 the others are on so that they have   
 got a chance to get to the other home.
