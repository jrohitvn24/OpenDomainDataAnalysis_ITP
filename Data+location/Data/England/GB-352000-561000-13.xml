 but are brought nearer to the farm in 
 severe weather and also during lambing
 time in March and April. They are fed 
 on hay, cattle cake and turnips when

 late May or June and then dipped. They
 are also dipped again a month or so   
 later. The rams are sold at auction in
 the autumn and the ewes are kept for  
 breading.
