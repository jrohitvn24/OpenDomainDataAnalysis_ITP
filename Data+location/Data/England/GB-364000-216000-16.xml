		<title>16MITCHELDEAN HEALTH SERVICES</title>
		<content>   Until recently a group of doctors   
 ran a practice at Forest House, on the
 main crossroads at the southern end of
 Mitcheldean. The accommodation was    
 cramped and car parking difficult. A  
 purpose built health centre has now   
 opened on a spare site in the town    
 centre, close to shops and car parking
 facilities. As there is no chemist,   
 prescriptions are dispensed at the    
 centre. There is no dentist in the    
 area, the nearest being Cinderford and
 Ross. There are no hospitals, the     
 nearest small one being at Cinderford,
 with Gloucester having the nearest    
 large one. Mitcheldean has a modern   
 state run old peoples home known as   
 Townsend House, together with a       
 private one at Bradley Court, half a  
 mile to the north. Drybrook has a     
 doctors surgery and a private old     
 persons home, the Euroclydon Hotel.   </content>
