		<title>14Leisure in Snape, Yorkshire.</title>
		<content>   Snape is a small village, but there 
 is plenty to do in it. The hall is    
 used for many things. There are domino
 drives, dances, discos, concerts,     
 parties and plays which are held      
 fairly regularly. People go to        
 meetings and clubs in the hall and you
 can play badminton there. During the  
 Summer holidays children can attend   
 the Holiday Club in the hall. There is
 a Youth Club which meets in the Chapel
 and children can go to Sunshine       
 Corner. The village has a park to play
 in and a playing field which is used  
 for playing football, rounders, rugby 
 and cricket. There is one pub in Snape
 with a small site for touring         
 caravans.
