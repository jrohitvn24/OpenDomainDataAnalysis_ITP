		<title>01General review of our area</title>
		<content>{  It is very largely farmland,either  
arable or pasture.  It is low-lying,   
except for a low ridge running NE from 
Ambrosden called Blackthorn Hill.  The 
SE part of our area contains the upper 
reaches of the River Ray.  The area is 
divided by the A41 Aylesbury\Banbury   
road.  The top section is almost       
entirely farmland.  The lower section  
contains two villages called Ambrosden 
&amp; Blackthorn.  Ambrosden is the larger 
because of the army estates.  It is an 
old village with a C12 (St Mary's      
Church, a Methodist Chapel &amp; St        
Barbara's RC Church.   Blackthorn is a 
'U'-shaped village with several farms. 
The Chiltern Railway Line crosses the  
area NW\SE on an embankment,except for 
a short cutting through BlackthornHill.
There is a large Army garrison with    
many installations operating an        
important Ordnance Depot.              </content>
