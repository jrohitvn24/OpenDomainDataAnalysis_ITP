		<content> The Jurassic clays produce a heavy,   
 sticky type of soil, almost impervious
 to water, difficult to work when wet  
 and often rock hard in dry weather;   
 but it is fertile and fairly alkaline.
 Land drains have been installed over  
 much of the farmland, which makes it  
 more suitable for ploughing and       
 re-seeding with grass, or other arable
 crops. The cornbrash in the north and 
 east of the block is better drained   
 and more workable.                    
 As most of the land is used at times  
 for grazing animals, the fields are   
 mostly of medium size with secure     
 boundaries, usually hedges. These     
 often grow on a bank of earth or      
 stone, perhaps originally a dry stone 
 wall. The hedges, formerly laid, are  
 now mechanically trimmed to about six 
 feet, which keeps them dense and stock
 proof.                                </content>
