		<title>02Traditional Medicine</title>
		<content>  Traditional medicine makes use  of   
 plants and herbs.A very old medicine  
 is comfrey  leaves for sprained and   
 broken bones.What the so called       
 witches of the village used to do was 
 chew the leaves of the comfrey plant  
 and when it was soft and mushy it was 
 held round the ankle with a           
 bandage.That is how comfrey earned its
 other name of Knitbone.The most common
 cure is rubbing nettle stings with    
 dock leaves.There are lots of old     
 remedies for warts.One of the         
 strangest was to rub the wart with a  
 dead frog then hang it on a tree.As   
 the frog withered the wart did.       
 Another one was to rub the wart with  
 chickweed and burn the chickweed on a 
 bonfire.One of the really unusual ones
 was cobwebs for wounds.I found there  
 were lots of cures for colds including
 garlic,blackcurrant and honey.        </content>
