		<title>17The School Catchment</title>
		<content> There are many areas from which the   
 Plume School pupils come.For example: 
 Goldhanger,Heybridge,Great Totham,    
 Wickham Bishops,Ulting,Woodham Walter,
 Purleigh,Hazeleigh,Latchingdon and    
 Mundon.Because some pupils live more  
 than three miles away from the school 
 they are entitled to free school      
 transport.The Council gives them a bus
 ticket each year.The school bus system
 works thus:the buses go to certain    
 stops where we all get on.First it    
 goes to Upper School(third to sixth   
 years) then to Lower School(first and 
 second years)                         
  In the evening some of the buses go  
 to Upper School first,and some to     
 Lower School.We have columns in the   
 playground and we queue up there.When 
 a teacher calls our area another      
 teacher shows us to our bus.
