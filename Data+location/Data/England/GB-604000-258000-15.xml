		<title>15Family Support in Stowmarket</title>
		<content>    There is a lot of help for old     
people.  There is sheltered            
accommodation in Iliffe Way where      
wardens are always available, as well  
as Stow Lodge, a large nursing home.   
Various clubs such as 'The Daffodils'  
and 'Silver Threads' organise outings  
for them.                              
     Physically and mentally           
handicapped people also receive a great
deal of help.  Special mini-buses      
take children to the schools in Ipswich
eg Belstead Special School.  Clubs are 
available eg the 'Gateway Club' and the
'Phabs'.  Mentally handicapped adults  
can attend the Social Education Centre 
where they learn crafts such as pottery
and gardening.  They also attend the   
clubs mentioned earlier.
