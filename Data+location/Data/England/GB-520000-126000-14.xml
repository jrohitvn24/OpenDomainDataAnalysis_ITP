		<title>14Jays the Butchers</title>
		<content> Mr Jays has been the butcher in Lower 
 Beeding for 14 years and he employs 2 
 assistants.  The shop was built 95    
 years ago and there have been 3       
 butchers there. The shop is open 6    
 days a week and sells vegetables and  
 general grocery items as well as meat.
 Beefburgers and special sausages -    
 pork and garlic, pork and apricot and 
 pork and leek - are made on the       
 premises. Customers are drawn from a  
 very wide area because of the fame of 
 the products.  Meat is also taken     
 abroad by people who work for airlines
 - bacon to Africa and steak to Saudi  
 Arabia. One man spends Â£500 a time on 
 steak for Arabia. Once a Lower Beeding
 boy was climbing in the Himalayas when
 he met a Mr.Ogg (who is attached to   
 the British Embassy in Kuala Lumpur). 
 "Oh, Lower Beeding - I get my sausages
 from there,sent out by diplomatic bag.</content>
