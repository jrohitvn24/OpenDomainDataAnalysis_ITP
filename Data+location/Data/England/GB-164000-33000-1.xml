		<title>01THE CROWAN-RELEATH DISTRICT</title>
		<content> This area is in West Cornwall and     
 about twenty miles from Lands End.    
 This area is not on the coast, it is  
 inland.   It is about 6 miles from    
 the sea at any point.   This area     
 is between two towns, Camborne to     
 the North and Helston to the South.   
 There are many hamlets including      
 Crowan, Releath and Burras.   The     
 land is mostly used for{farming}and   
 growing crops.   A large part is      
 moor land, scattered with old mine    
 works and shafts that are no longer   
 used, but were once part of           
 Cornwall's tin mining industry.       
 The area enjoys a mild{climate.       
 It is warmer and wetter than the      
 rest of the country. The population   
 is small and scattered around.   It   
 numbers approximately one thousand    
 nine hundred and sixty.
