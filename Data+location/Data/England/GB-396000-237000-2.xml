		<content>{  Ashton Under Hill}is a highly sought
 after, even modish place to live.     
 Charm of location and buildings answer
 20th century nostalgia, but equally   
 attractive is it's quiet location,    
 close to major routes but away from   
 the modern curse of high volume       
 through traffic.                      
   A thriving village school of over 60
 pupils and several daily bus services 
 to local towns help to attract and    
 hold a population of wide age range.  
   The incoming population tends to be 
 relatively well educated, active and  
 family orientated. They create a wide 
 range of social activities comparable 
 with a population of around 700, well 
 utilizing the church, chapel, village 
 hall and playing fields.              
   Agriculture and horticulture has    
 greatly diminished, but it still gives
 an attractive rural image to the area.</content>
