		<title>08THE PUMP HOUSE</title>
		<content>    The Pump House is at the end of the
 village next to the T.Junction. It was
 built in 1875 which was the same time 
 as the school.                        
    It was the main source of water in 
 the village. The water came from an   
 under-ground spring.                  
    The pump was in a semi-circular    
 shelter with seats in. The pump is no 
 longer there.                         
    The building is now a house. On the
 right is the village hall where they  
 hold W.I.meetings.                    
    The village hall was once used for 
 a school canteen.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
