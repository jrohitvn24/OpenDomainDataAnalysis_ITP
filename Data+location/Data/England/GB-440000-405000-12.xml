		<title>12A Holiday at Skegness.</title>
		<content> We went to{Skegness}for our holiday.It
 took us 3 hours to get there. We went 
 to a caravan site called North Shore  
 Holiday Camp. When we got there my Mum
 and Dad got the caravan stands down.  
 My Mum got everything sorted out while
 my sister and I played ball. Then we  
 had dinner. After dinner we went to   
 the beach for a paddle before we went 
 shopping. After tea we had a shower   
 and got changed and went to the       
 amusements.                           
 On the day we went home, in the       
 morning we went shopping. We came back
 and had our dinner, then we went to   
 the beach. We had some crisps and a   
 drink and set off for home. I was sick
 on the way back.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
