       Fenton, not mentioned in the    
 1086 survey, must have come into      
 existence at some later date. The     
 village stands on some low lying land 
 between the rivers Witham and the     
 Brant, suggesting that the name       
 derives from the fact that it is the  
 "town in the fen". It is the smallest 
 of our three villages and at the 1981 
 census had a population of 68 with 20 
 households.                           
       The church and churchyard are   
 used only on special occasions. Most  
 of the houses are of red brick apart  
 from the old part of the farm near the
 church which contains part of the     
 remains of Fenton Hall.               
       There are four farms in the     
 village and the land contained in our 
 block is wholly arable.
