		<content>  I got up at 7:00 and watched The     
A-Team on video.Then I washed my face, 
got dressed and went out to the car.   
Some friends came too.We were going to 
Great Leighs,near Braintree.We had     
lunch at the Sportsman pub on the way. 
I had a beefburger and fries(chipped   
potatoes).When we got to Great Leighs  
we watched the racing tractors pull a  
steel sledge.One tractor was called    
Nightmare.Next we went to see the      
Banger Racing.A wheel came off one of  
them and it nearly hit me.Afterwards we
went home and had sandwiches for tea.
