		<title>01A DAY IN THE LIFE OF RACHEL</title>
		<content> The alarm wakes me up at 8.00 o'clock.
 I get up and go to the bathroom but   
 nearly always someone is in there. I  
 go into the kitchen and eat my        
 breakfast. I hate breakfast. I get    
 dressed after lots of thought on what 
 to wear and go to school. Usually we  
 read but I'm still half asleep so I   
 have difficulty. We do Maths for an   
 hour but the bell rings so we go into 
 the hall for service. At 11.00 am we  
 come in after play. We have lunch at  
 12.o'clock; I'm very hungry so I eat  
 mine in about five minutes.We go out  
 for break until 1.15 pm.  If it isn't 
 games then we usually do art or       
 science in the afternoon. When I      
 get home I'm hungry and tired so I    
 have a snack. At dinner I get teased  
 by my brother and sister. Then I watch
 television. When I'm tired I go to    
 bed.                                  </content>
