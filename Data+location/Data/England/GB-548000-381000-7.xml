		<title>07Roads and Traffic in Sutton</title>
		<content> The roads in Sutton are being repaired
 at the moment.Sutton is deserted in   
 the winter although they are building 
 a lot of new houses here at the       
 moment.When it is summer Sutton is    
 full of holiday makers and elderly    
 people.The car park down the High     
 Street is full at the moment.The roads
 are very dangerous in the winter when 
 it has being snowing.Many people fall 
 over in the snow and some people get  
 injured.There is a zebra crossing and 
 a roundabout.There are not many spaces
 left to park your car in the summer   
 because there are only 2 carparks in  
 Sutton and not a lot of room in front 
 of the shops.There are lots of roads  
 coming of the High Street but some of 
 them are narrow.
