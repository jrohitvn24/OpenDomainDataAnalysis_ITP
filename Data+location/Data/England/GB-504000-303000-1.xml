		<title>01BARNACK AREA:AN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> This area is a farming area growing   
 barley,wheat and oil seed rape.There  
 are a few pasture fields and some for 
 potatoes,beans etc.There are two      
 villages, Barnack and Pilsgate.Barnack
 has a Church and a Methodist chapel.  
 The church is made of Barnack Ragstone
 from the Hills and Holes quarry once  
 famous.Nearby there is a new housing  
 estate and above this is the Cricket  
 Club.Pilsgate is a hamlet near to     
 Stamford.It has one farm.The farmers  
 rent a lot of land from the two main  
 estates Walcot and Burghley.The block 
 has much natural beauty and is a      
 conservation area.Being adjacent to   
 Wittering airfield the peacefulness of
 the area is often shattered by        
 Harriers overflying.Shopping and      
 business takes place outside the      
 block in Peterborough or Stamford.
