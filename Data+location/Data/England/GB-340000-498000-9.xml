		<content> Tourism is one of the major industries
 of the Lake District. The natural     
 beauty of the region attracts many    
 thousands of people from home and     
 abroad every year who come to walk,   
 climb, water ski, sail, or just enjoy 
 the scenery.                          
 Windermere is within 20 minutes of the
 M6 motorway as well as being the rail 
 terminus for the southern Lakes. As a 
 result, it is a natural focus for     
 visitors with many hotels of all      
 categories, and bed and breakfast     
 places in abundance, as shown in the  
 statistical data. A lot of people use 
 static or touring caravans, and camp  
 sites are usually full in the main    
 season.                               
 The main tourist office is situated   
 near Windermere station and always    
 eems to be busy, particularly helping 
 to find accomodation.                 </content>
