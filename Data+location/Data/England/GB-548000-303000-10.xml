     BEAUPRE HALL GROUPED HOMES        
 Beaupre Hall is named after a famous  
 Outwell family who lived in a         
 medieval manor house near Wisbech     
 Road in the 15th century. The manor   
 house was demolished in 1966. The     
 Grouped home for the elderly was built
 in 1973 by the Kings Lynn and West    
 Norfolk District Council. There are 29
 residents,including 3 couples. The    
 ages of the residents range from 78 to
 93. Mrs. Stanford is the current      
 Warden, Mrs. Setchell is the Deputy   
 Warden and there are 3 home helpers.  
 Mrs. Stanford's day begins at 7.00a.m.
 when she does her rounds to check if  
 each resident is alright. Either Mrs. 
 Stanford or Mrs. Setchell has to      
 remain on the premises during the day.
 Their day finishes at 10.00p.m. when  
 the building is locked up.            </content>
