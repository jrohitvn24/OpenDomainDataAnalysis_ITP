		<content> Laughton is a small village in Sussex.
 Although there are not very many      
 people living there, they work in lots
 of different places. We went round the
 school and asked the children where   
 their parents worked: seventy children
 were in school that day.              
 There were 14 parents who worked in   
 Laughton, mainly in                   
 agriculture-related jobs. The next    
 most popular place was Brighton, with 
 13 parents working there. London had  
 11 and Lewes, our county town, 7.     
 Other workplaces included Glynde,     
 where 5 parents work, Glyndebourne(3),
 Ripe(3), Burgess Hill(2),             
 Peacehaven(2), and Chalvington(2).    
 Other parents travel as far as        
 Maidenhead, Birmingham and Manchester.
 People who work a long way away have  
 to travel by car because Laughton has 
 no train station and very few buses.  </content>
