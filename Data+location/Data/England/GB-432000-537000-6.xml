		<title>06UNCLE TOM &amp; AUNTY MOLLY</title>
		<content> You may think that our Uncle Tom and  
 Aunty Molly are just two people who   
 live in Cassop and get on with their  
 own lives,but they do a great deal for
 the village.                          
 They organise events for the young and
 the elderly.Aunty Molly makes cakes   
 for special occasions.We think that if
 it wasn't for them life in the village
 would not be as good.                 
 On Sports Day Uncle Tom was up at 6.30
 a.m putting tents up and organising   
 the races.In the afternoon Aunty Molly
 was busy selling hot-dogs and         
 drinks.It was a brilliant day and     
 everyone enjoyed it.                  
 In the evening they held a family     
 disco for all ages.                   
 This piece is about Mr.&amp; Mrs.T.Wilson.
 At the moment Aunty Molly is busy with
 about 50 cakes,she will ice them all  
 herself.                              </content>
