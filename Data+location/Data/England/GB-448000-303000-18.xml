		<content> Today we went to Ratby church to talk 
 to the vicar.We found out that about  
 3,000 people live in Ratby and about  
 5% of that number go to church.There  
 is also a Methodist church,a Muslim   
 family and a West Indian family who   
 organise their own services which are 
 much livlier than ours.Catholic people
 go by mini-bus to their church at New 
 Parks.                                
      We looked at the parish registers
 and saw that in 1984 there were 15    
 weddings in the church.There were 21  
 funerals.We found out that very few   
 people die under the age of 50 these  
 days.                 {Jonathan A.    
                                       
 In Kirby Muxloe there are two         
 churches.The Parish church and the    
 Free church.Both are well attended.   
 People come from further afield to    
 attend the free church(evangelical)   </content>
