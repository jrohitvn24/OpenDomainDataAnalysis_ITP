		<title>05Employment in the D-Block</title>
		<content>  Much of the{employment}in the area is
 connected with farming.Apart from the 
 farm-owners there are some self-      
 employed farmers who help with relief 
 milking,lambing,harvesting,hedge-     
 laying etc.                           
  Neither village has any industry or  
 employment other than{agriculture,}so 
 people must commute to nearby towns or
 cities for jobs.The majority of{      
{commuters}travel to Leicester,but some
 work in Market Harborough,Kibworth or 
 Fleckney.A few travel further to      
 London,Birmingham,Rugby and           
 Corby.People are mostly employed in   
 the{service industries}in business and
 management.                           
  There is no public transport in the  
 area,so everyone travels to work by   
 car.Many of the wives work too,full-  
 time or part-time.This is an area of  
 low unemployment at this time.        </content>
