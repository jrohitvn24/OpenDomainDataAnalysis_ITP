		<title>18Recreation in Kirtlington</title>
		<content>We carried out a survey that was       
completed by 61% of people living in   
Kirtlington. They appear to follow a   
wide variety of activities for their   
recreation. The most common hobbies in 
order of popularity are:               
  Gardening, Swimming, Music, Cycling, 
Tennis, Equestrian Sports, Golf,       
Knitting, Photography, Squash, Water   
Sports (other than swimming), Running, 
Football, Cricket, Nature, Bird-       
watching, Darts, Fishing, Dress-making,
"Computering", Skating (ice and        
roller), Bowls, Bell-ringing,          
Gymnastics, Dominoes, Hockey, Morris   
Dancing, Wine making, Tapestry,        
Television and Travelling.             
     It is interesting that nearly half
of these hobbies are sporting          
activities. We wonder if this will     
always be so.
