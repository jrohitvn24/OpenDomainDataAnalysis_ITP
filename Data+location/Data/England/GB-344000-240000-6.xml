		<title>06Ecclesiastical Boundary</title>
		<content> An unusual boundary situation exists  
 in that, whereas the civil parish of  
 Eaton Bishop is now bounded on the    
 north by the River Wye, the           
 ecclesiastical parish of that name    
 extends across the river to include an
 area on the north side. (The civil    
 parish used to do so too.) Thus it is 
 necessary for parishioners on that    
 side to cross the river to reach Eaton
 Bishop parish church. This arrangement
 was facilitated in earlier days by the
 existence of a ferry, now             
 discontinued, which plied across the  
 river. Nowadays, the river crossing,  
 though easier by car, involves a      
 detour of about eight miles to cross  
 by the nearest bridge westwards, at   
 Bridge Sollers.
