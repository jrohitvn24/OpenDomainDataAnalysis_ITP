		<title>11Tollesbury Village</title>
		<content> We live in Tollesbury.   Tollesbury is
 about half a km square, people usually
 come here because of the Estuary.     
 There are two churches, one is St.    
 Mary's and the other is United Reform.
   The main street goes straight       
 through the  village right down to    
 Mell Farm and the River Blackwater.   
 There is one petrol garage as you     
 enter the village, 3 public houses The
 Hope, The Victoria and the Kings Head 
 and a British Legion Club, also a     
 school, post office and several shops.
   Around the village are five farms.  
 We also have a  doctor's surgery, a   
 bank and a volunteer fire service with
 one fire engine.   Tollesbury is a    
 good place to live.
