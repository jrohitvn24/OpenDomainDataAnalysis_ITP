		<title>07Games We Play</title>
		<content> At school we play padder tennis every 
 summer and we have our own Wimledon   
 competition. We have a handicap but   
 usually the best player wins anyway.  
 We have trophies for the singles and  
 doubles.                              
       Every Thursday a mother comes to
 help the girls with netball and       
 rounders. We sometimes play other     
 schools. On a Monday afternoon a bus  
 takes us to Chester baths and we go   
 with children from Harthill School.   
       Last week we had the Deanery    
 Sports when 18 schools join in        
 different races.                      
       I like playing cricket at home  
 with my brother and he plays for a    
 Tattenhall team every weekend in the  
 summer. Every Sunday I play snooker   
 with my uncle. When I have nothing    
 else to do I watch television.I like  
 space programmes and old films.       </content>
