		<content> Vegetation on the uplands of          
 Thundersley is lighter than in South  
 Benfleet.Scrub and heathland can be   
 found amongst a variety of lighter    
 trees than in South Benfleet,where the
 heavy soil supported elm trees for    
 thousands of years,as well as oak,ash 
 and thorn.Almost all of the elms      
 succumbed to the Dutch Elm disease in 
 the 1970's and most of their dead     
 trunks have now been removed.Some     
 young trees are emerging from suckers,
 but most begin to die on reaching a   
 height of about 20 feet.The local     
 council is making a good effort to    
 plant new trees of a wide variety.    
 Sadly,many of these young trees were  
 vandalized,and it is now hoped that   
 by enlisting school children with the 
 planting of trees that these will be  
 left to grow.
