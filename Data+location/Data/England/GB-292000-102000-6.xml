		<title>06   Changes in Silverton</title>
		<content>    In Silverton a number of changes   
 have occurred. Shops have changed     
 and different houses have been built. 
 Estates have been added and Silverton 
 has been modernized.                  
                                       
    The first estate to be built was   
 for the Council in the late fifties,  
 followed by the private developments  
 of Silverdale and Applemead in the    
 sixties.  The Health Centre and the   
 new Silverton School were built in the
 seventies, together with the housing  
 development around Wyndham Road. The  
 most recent phase has been the Wimpey 
 estate of Hederman Close. Since then, 
 the only development has been         
 infilling with individual houses, and 
 the building of a car park and toilets
 at the back of the Health Centre.
