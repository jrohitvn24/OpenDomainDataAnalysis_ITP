		<content> Borehamwood is unusual in having a    
 three-tier system of state schooling. 
 Pupils attend one of nine first       
 schools from 5-9 years, then transfer 
 to a middle school for the years 9-13,
 and to either{Hillside}or{Nicholas    
{Hawksmoor}upper school from 13        
 onwards. Two of the middle schools,   
{Holmshill}and{Lyndhurst,}collaborated 
 in the Domesday survey of this area   
 while the third,{Furzehill,}worked on 
 an adjacent section.                  
 Set remotely in the countryside north 
 of Elstree are the two independent    
{Haberdashers' Aske's}schools          
 accommodating some 1300 boys and 700  
 girls as day pupils. Founded in       
 London in 1690, the boys' school moved
 to the former Aldenham House in 1959, 
 while the girls' school transferred in
 1974 to new premises erected on an    
 adjacent site.                        </content>
