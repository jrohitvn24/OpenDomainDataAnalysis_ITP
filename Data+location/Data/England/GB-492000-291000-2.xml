		<title>02Housing - Deenethorpe</title>
		<content>The majority of homes are small, stone-
built, detached houses...although short
terraces were found in both Deene and  
Deenethorpe.All housing is owned by the
Brudenell family, and many buildings   
date from the 17th &amp; 18th centuries.   
                                       
In  Deenethorpe there are 6 detached   
cottages built in past centuries, each 
with a small garden, and a group of 6  
terraced homes..dated from the 1950's. 
There is also a farm (Manor Farm), and 
a residence in the Porter's Lodge (part
of the Brudenell's Deene Park gateway),
situated a few hundred metres to the   
west of Deenethorpe, on the A43 road.
