		<title>19St. Bede's School.</title>
		<content> St. Bede's School is situated in a    
 small village near Hailsham, just off 
 the A23. It started about 9 years ago 
 as a boy's School. It's grounds used  
 to belong to a man called Horatio     
 Bottomly who built quite a lot of the 
 village. At present it is an          
 international school with no class    
 barrier. There are about 300 pupils,  
 the majority of whom are boarders. The
 School owns about 45 acres of land    
 which is divided into 3 main parts;   
 the main grounds and dorms, the       
 administrative block, eating, games   
 and activity facilities.              
   Away from the School is the Stud    
 which is also a boy's house, together 
 with girls' chalets. The Riding School
 also belongs to St. Bede's and riding 
 activities are offered daily. Around  
 the Stud are 3 large games pitches.   
 Camberlot is also a boy's house.      </content>
