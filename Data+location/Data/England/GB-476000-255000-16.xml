		<title>16Children's Games in Wootton.</title>
		<content>  The most popular game among boys was 
football and among girls netball.Other 
games mentioned were British Bulldog,  
Hopscotch and Stoney.                  
  To play British Bulldog everybody    
stands behind a line except for one    
person.That person calls someone's name
and that person has to run over a line 
on the other side of the playground.If 
they are tigged they join the catcher  
in the middle.                         
  In Hopscotch a stone is thrown onto  
a numbered square and the player has to
hop up the squares and back, avoiding  
that square. The stone is then thrown  
onto the next square along and so on.  
  Stoney is a form of hide-and-seek.If 
the person who is on sees one of the   
others she runs to a tree and shouts,  
"Stoney,one,two,three." The first one  
seen is on next time.
