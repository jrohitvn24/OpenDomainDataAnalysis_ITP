		<content>There are primary schools in East      
Hagbourne, South Moreton and Blewbury. 
The school in East Hagbourne is a      
Church of England foundation and takes 
children from the surrounding area     
outside the village including part of  
Didcot. Blewbury school covers the     
village which lies outside our area.   
The school at south Moreton covers     
approx. a 3 mile area and has made     
recent efforts to provide extended     
facilities for the school and preschool
children. The village is conservation  
conscious and has just spent #300 on   
providing 26 trees for the playing     
field which also has a sand pit, swings
and a climbing frame. There are at     
present 101 pupils at the school,      
divided into 4 classes with 5 staff    
(two are part time). From here pupils  
go to St. Birinus or Didcot Girls
