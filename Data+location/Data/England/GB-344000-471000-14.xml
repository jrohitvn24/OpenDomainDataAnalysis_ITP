		<title>14Transport in Silverdale</title>
		<content>  An unclassified road runs parallel to
 the coastline ending at Brown's Houses
 which are almost on the shore. It is  
 used by the the inhabitants of the few
 houses along its length, and in the   
 summer by holiday makers visiting Jack
 Scout and the shore at Jenny Brown's  
 Point.                                
  The unclassified road between        
 Silverdale and Carnforth just crosses 
 the north-east corner of the review   
 area.                                 
  The railway line between Preston and 
 Barrow-in-Furness also runs across the
 same corner. It is raised about 2.5   
 metres to guard against flooding.     
 There are goods and passenger         
 services, including the carriage of   
 nuclear waste.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
