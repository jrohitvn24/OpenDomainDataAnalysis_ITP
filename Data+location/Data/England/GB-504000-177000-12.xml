		<title>12A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> On a Monday morning my alarm clock    
 goes off. Chaos is erupting in the    
 house. Soon it is eight o'clock and it
 is time for my scrambled egg. At eight
 thirty it is off to school in the car 
 and Mrs Burns blows the whistle for   
 the start of school. She tells us to  
 get our homework and go to our        
 classroom. We have assembly, and then 
 it is time for religion. Soon it is   
 playtime and we play rounders or tag. 
 Mrs Burns blows the whistle for the   
 end of break and it is time for Maths 
 and English. Bell has just been rung  
 for dinner. I have ham rolls and      
 sweets. It is a big playtime and we   
 play rounders. After playtime we have 
 physical education in which we get out
 apparatus and equipment and do        
 exercises. Soon it is playtime. Then  
 after we have a quiet read. End of    
 school. Hurrah!                       </content>
