		<title>14THe Knepp Estate, Shipley.3.</title>
		<content>      {Changing Times - The Future?}   
     Knepp Estate including seven      
 tenanted farms holds to a policy of   
 retaining hedges and has resisted     
 modern pressures to enlarge fields for
 more efficient use of machinery and   
 manpower. It is based on drainage,    
 variety of soil types, conservation   
 and hunting.In recent years reductions
 in employees and amalgamation of farms
 have reduced the need for tied cottage
 and farmhouse accomodation. Some have 
 been sold.                            
     Following the recent death of Sir 
 Walter Burrell in 1985 and changes in 
 taxation laws there are bound to be   
 reconsiderations of farming and       
 management policies on the Knepp      
 Estate.
