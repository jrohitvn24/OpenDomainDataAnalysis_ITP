		<content> including 8{Airey war houses          
 (prefabricated dwellings for the rapid
 housing of people after the 1939_45   
 war, which were intended to last for  
 about 20 years) A few of the houses   
 now have{owner occupiers,}since the   
 Council made them available for       
 purchase by their tenants.            
  Further development is strictly      
 controlled by the Green Belt policy,  
 and by the University of Manchester   
 who have influence in{planning        
{control,}in order to restrict radio   
 interference with their telescopes at 
{Jodrell Bank.}There have been about   
 nine houses or bungalows built in the 
 last 20 years, all for reasons        
 connected with work or business.
