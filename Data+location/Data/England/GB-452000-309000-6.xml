		<title>06A LOCAL ANSTEY TRAMP.</title>
		<content> There is a tramp who roams around     
 Anstey. His nickname is White _eye    
 because he has a white eyebrow. He is 
 38 years old and he says his parents  
 were millionares. He was once married 
 but his wife threw him out of his own 
 home. He goes from house to house     
 trying to get food and water. People  
 often see white eye in the streets    
 with a carrier bag in his hand and    
 looking very scruffy. He usually      
 sleeps rough or in barns. Many people 
 in Anstey tell stories about him, such
 as he finds cigarettes ends and looks 
 for paper to roll his own cigarettes. 
 I often see him walking by my house. I
 think he must do the same route every 
 day.                                  
 Some people are scared of him, some   
 people feel sorry for him.
