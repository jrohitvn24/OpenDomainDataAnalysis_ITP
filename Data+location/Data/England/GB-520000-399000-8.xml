		<content> Manor Farm, Hatcliffe is run by Miss  
 Allis. They grow crops such as clover 
 seeds, mustard, oil seed rape, beans  
 and she also breeds beef cows. Miss   
 Allis has lived at Manor Farm for 46  
 years. The land has changed from sheep
 to arable.                            
 The village of Hatcliffe is one of the
 prettiest villages around. It is      
 purely residential. In the actual     
 village of Hatcliffe there are 29     
 houses. There have been quite bad     
 floods over the years because there is
 a stream running through the village. 
 The most recent flood was in 1981.    
 Hatcliffe's church is called St       
 Mary's, which was built in the 13th   
 century. There was an old chapel,     
 school house and a post office. Now   
 they all have been converted into     
 houses. The oldest cottage is Cherry  
 Tree Cottage which was built in 16 C. </content>
