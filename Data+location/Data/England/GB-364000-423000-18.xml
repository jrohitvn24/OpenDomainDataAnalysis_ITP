		<title>18FOOD EATEN IN BLACKBURN</title>
		<content>      Some examples of our food today  
 are chips, baked beans and curry and  
 rice.                                 
      Chips are made with potatoes. We 
 peel them, cut them up into strips and
 put them in fat until they are a light
 brown colour.                         
      Baked beans are in a tomato      
 sauce, they can be eaten with         
 anything, especially chips and        
 beefburgers.                          
      Curry and rice is a hot, spicy   
 meal. Rice is a small, white, oval    
 shape. Curry is a spicy liquid with   
 meat and kidney beans in it.          
      We have places where you can go  
 out for a meal or a soft drink, such  
 as cafes and burger houses. In these  
 places you can buy beefburgers,       
 hamburgers and chips. The burger      
 houses have different names, such as  
 MacDonalds and Big Boy.               </content>
