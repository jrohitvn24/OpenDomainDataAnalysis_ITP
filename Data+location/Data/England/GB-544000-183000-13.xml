		<title>13A (school) DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> (Tony, age 13):  I rise at 7.30, get  
 dressed and have a cup of tea. I then 
 take my Yorkshire Terrier for a walk. 
 30 minutes later I get back and watch 
 Breakfast Television for a half hour. 
 At 8.30 I leave the house, walk round 
 the corner and knock for Steve to go  
 to school. With our other mate, Paul, 
 we stop at the sweet shop and then    
 have 15 minutes to get to school.     
   At school we do the same subjects   
 each week.                            
   At the end of school we walk home.  
 At night I might watch T.V. or        
 sometimes I have homework, but I      
 usually do that at school. On Tuesday 
 and Thursday nights we go to cadets   
 in our uniform.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
