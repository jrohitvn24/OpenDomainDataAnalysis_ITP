		<title>16HANWOOD VILLAGE SHOP</title>
		<content> The owners live on the premises and   
 run this small shop with the help of  
 three part time assistants and a team 
 of paper boys. The shop opens 7 days a
 week. 6.30am -6pm Monday - Saturday   
 and 7am - 1pm Sunday.The shop stocks a
 wide range of goods from groceries to 
 toys. It is a{newsagent, off licence, 
{T.V. video library,}agent for shoe    
 repairs, flower arrangements, dry     
 cleaning and photographic printing.   
                                       
 The owner caters for village needs,   
 stocking items that tend to be        
 forgotten during the main shop in     
 Shrewsbury. Thursday is the busiest   
 day when Shrewsbury shops have half   
 day closing. The shop serves a two    
 mile radius. Its situation on the A488
 attracts custom from commuter traffic.
{A micro computer}has reduced the hours
 required for book keeping.            </content>
