		<content> This Domesday Block forms part of the 
 Surrey commuter belt and lies  two    
 miles south of Guildford. It is a well
 populated area, residential rather    
 than industrial, most people finding  
 employment outside the area. There are
 excellent communications serving the  
 area by road, rail and water. The D.  
 Block forms a very pleasing           
 environment with park and leisure     
 facilities easily available.          
 Educationally the area is served by   
 several state schools and the private 
 establishment of Charterhouse plays a 
 prominent part in the community.
