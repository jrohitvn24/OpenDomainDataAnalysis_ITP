		<title>12OUR SCHOOL DAY by CLASS 7</title>
		<content> We go to school at Bengeworth C.E.    
 First School.  We start school at nine
 o'clock and finish at three o'clock.  
 When we have put our coats on our     
 pegs, we go into our classrooms.  The 
 classroom are all different sizes.    
 When we have come into the classroom  
 our teacher tskes the register, which 
 is a list of names and when we call   
 out our number our teacher ticks us   
 off in the book.  Then we start       
 lessons.  In our room we look at a    
 roller blackboard and the writing on  
 it is in white chalk.  In Maths we are
 doing multiplying, decimal fractions  
 and dividing.  In English we write    
 stories, poems and work from different
 books.  Every week we learn twenty    
 spellings.  Our desks are wooden and  
 in them we keep our pens, pencils and 
 books.
