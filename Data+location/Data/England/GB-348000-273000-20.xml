		<title>20LUDLOW FESTIVAL</title>
		<content> The festival has its roots in a       
 tradition of drama in the Castle      
 established in the 1950's with a      
 series of productions in aid of the   
 restoration of St. Lawrences' Parish  
 Church.                               
  From a modest beginning in 1960 the  
 Festival has grown steadily until,25  
 years on,it has a national reputation.
 Its central feature is the            
 professional production of a          
 Shakespeare play in the open air      
 setting of Ludlow Castle.The play runs
 for some 15 performances in late June 
 and early July and in 25 years only 2 
 of 400 performances have been rained  
 off completely.Evening performances on
 fine summer nights often generate a   
 quite magical atmosphere as night     
 descends on the auditorium.
