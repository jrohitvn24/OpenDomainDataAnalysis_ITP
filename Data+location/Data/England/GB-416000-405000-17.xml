		<content> There are many springs and small      
 streams in the area. Eventually these 
 feed the River Holme.The water is     
 very soft due to the peat on moors:   
 that is why the textile industry grew 
 up here. Each mill had its own dam.   
 Dobroyd still has two which are now   
 trout ponds.The local water is also   
 well suited to brewing beer. Water is 
 supplied to houses from two main      
 reservoirs Broadstone and Holmstyes.  
 Some houses have wells in their       
 cellars.A tunnel runs from Broadstone 
 towards Hepworth Iron Company and was 
 built in the 1850s. Horse troughs     
 collecting spring water are common.   
 Hepworth has public wells where       
 women used to wash clothes.There is a 
 covered reservoir near Rusby Wood.    
 Farms and cottages in outlying areas  
 have septic tank sewage disposal.
