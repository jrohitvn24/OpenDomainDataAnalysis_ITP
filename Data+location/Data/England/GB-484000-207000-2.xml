           The Gurney Family has       
lived in Wendover since 1500. A member 
of this family remembers when the      
Windmill and the Watermill were in     
working order, and together with the   
Gas Works along Wharf Road they        
supplied power for the industry of     
Wendover. Until the advent of the      
railway, coal was delivered by barge   
along the canal. Wendover was also an  
agricultural village and stone picking 
was practised. The workers received    
soup from the soup kitchens along Clay 
Lane. Sacks of soot came from London to
fertilize the fields. Wendover has seen
many celebrations in its time, such as 
the last Jubilee of 1935, and Empire   
Day and also during the last war when  
Winston Churchill stayed at Chequers.
