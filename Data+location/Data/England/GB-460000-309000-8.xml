    There are 8 doctors in the health  
 centre and 12 district nurses who     
 visit schools around the area. Mums   
 take their babies to be weighed on    
 Mondays. Also each doctor sees 15     
 patients a day as an average.         
                                       
{THE SHOP ON THE GREEN}                
    8, The Green, Syston, was built in 
 1780. It is now an antiques shop but, 
 in the past, it has been a private    
 school. a sweet shop, a corn merchants
 and a decorators' shop. It used to    
 belong to the house next door to it   
 but now they are two separate houses. 
 The roof is made of local, Swithland  
 slates. On the floor are quarry tiles.
 The water pump in the back garden     
 dates back to 1788. There is also a   
 brick built well.
