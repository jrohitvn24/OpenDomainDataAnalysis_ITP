		<title>08BELLRINGING  LT.WALTHAM I</title>
		<content>  Have you ever swung half a ton on    
 the end of a rope?                    
{Little Waltham Church}was where we    
 did this.To get to the bellropes you  
 had to go in to a room up a ladder    
 through a trap door and into another  
 room.This room had six bell ropes.The 
 ropes had unwoven wool which is called
 a{sally}.We were shown how to make the
 bell go from the down position to the 
 up.The lightest is called the{treble. 
 The second is called second,the third,
 third,and so on until the sixth which 
 is called{tenor.}If a bell is in the  
 up position it is more dangerous      
 because you are ringing.When down you 
 only chime so it's easier.            
  Lightest is the highest and heaviest 
 the deepest.They use the numbers of   
 the bells 1,2,3,4,5 and 6,so they know
 when its their turn in a tune.
