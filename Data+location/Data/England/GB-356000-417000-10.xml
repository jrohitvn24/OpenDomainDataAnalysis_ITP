		<content> ASTLEY HALL (2)                       
                                       
The collections of paintings and       
pottery at the hall are of exceptional 
interest. There is also an art gallery 
where exhibitions by local artists are 
reguarly held                          
The drawing room has been refurbished  
as a period room displaying early 18th.
Century furniture.                     
Astley Hall is situated in Astley Park 
and is named after the Astley family,  
one of the early owners of the Hall and
vast gardens.                          
It is rumered that underground         
passageways once existed linking the   
Hall to St.Lawrence's Church (the      
Parish Church) and a building which is 
now the Yarrow Bridge Hotel on Bolton  
Road on the South side of Chorley.
