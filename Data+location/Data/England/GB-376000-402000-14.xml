		<title>14Clifton Junction industry(1)</title>
		<content>    {Clifton Junction}is an industrial 
 area bounded by the{River Irwell}to   
 the east, the edge of the Clifton     
 Green{housing estate}to the west, the 
{M62 motorway}to the north and by the  
{Manchester-Bolton railway}to the      
 south.                                
     Most of this area is taken up by  
{Pilkingtins Tile factory, Chloride    
{Batteries and Magnesium Electron Ltd. 
     All of these factories back onto  
 the{River Irwell,}which in the days   
 they were built provided a much needed
 supply of water and also a means of   
{transport.}The{Manchester-Bolton-Bury 
{canal}also runs at the back of the    
 factories and this waterway was a most
 important means of transport when the 
 factories were built, at the end of   
 the{last century.
