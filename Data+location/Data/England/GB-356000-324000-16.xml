 There is some concern over the use of 
 Bridle Paths and footpaths in the area
 as walkers and ramblers sometimes     
 stray from the designated area into   
 the fields.  Some villagers, mainly   
 parents and teenagers would like to   
 see a play area and Youth Club in     
 existence.  Parts of the area are     
 without mains water and this is       
 something that residents would like to
 be installed.  There has recently been
 a leakage from a lagoon at Aston which
 resulted in pollution of the River and
 the death of all the fish.  As the    
 public services are not the same      
 throughout the area, some residents   
 would like a weekly refuse collection.
 These are only minor irritations and  
 there is a general feeling of         
 satisfaction with the village and the 
 amenities currently provided.         </content>
