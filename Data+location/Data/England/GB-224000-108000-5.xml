		<content> Apart from the managed farmland the   
 following habitats occur.{Oak scrub. }
 This exists in the bottom of the      
 Stratt valley.{Re-generate marsh.}i.e 
 once cultivated but now reverted to   
 marsh as in the Lamberal valley.{Wet  
{water meadows.}These occur in the S.E.
 corner of the block around Venn.{Flora
 Roughly the 6 eastern squares of the  
 block contain marshland plants and the
 6 western squares are drier with an   
 arable flora and woodland edgetype.{  
{Trees.}There are many clumps of       
 sycamore around farm buildings. What  
 little remains of English and Cornish 
 Elm is suffering from Ditch Elm       
 Disease. Strong westerly winds off    
 the Atlantic mean there are few large 
 trees on the plateau and what there   
 are are bent and withered on the      
 windward side.
