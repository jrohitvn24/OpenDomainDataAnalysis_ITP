		<title>04FARMING IN NORTH KEWSTOKE</title>
		<content> Much of the farmland in this area is  
 low lying and requires extensive      
 draining which is done by a system of 
 rhynes and ditches.These need regular 
 attention by the Water Authority and  
 individual farmers.                   
 The land in the main is used for the  
 upkeep and grazing of animals.One farm
 has 1200 sheep and 200 cows.Most of   
 the fields that are not used for      
 grazing grow grass to produce hay and 
 silage.Recently one farm has been     
 forced by E.E.C regulations to        
 restrict their output of milk.They    
 have done this by using some of their 
 fields to grow wheat and barley which 
 is used for animal feeding.This same  
 farm has joined forces with the       
 National Trust to plant trees on the  
 farm such as ash and turkey oak to    
 replace the elm trees recently lost.
