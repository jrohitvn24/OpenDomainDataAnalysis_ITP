		<content> One fine morning I woke up sleepily   
 and read my comic called the          
{Beano.}Then my mum came up with some  
 orange.I finished my drink and then   
 I went to the bathroom to wash my     
 self.After I had finished in the      
 bathroom I went to get dressed.I      
 slipped on my shoes and combed my     
 hair.I went down stairs and had my    
 breakfast.For breakfast I had         
{cornflakes}and{hot buttered toast.}I  
 got my bag ready for school.My bag    
 contained my lunch and games kit.I set
 off for school on my bike.My bike is  
 called a{Micron 5}which has 5 gears.  
 When I got to school I put my bike in 
 the bike sheds.I went to the          
 playground. The whistle blew and the  
{ red board}went up so I walked in     
 the classroom.I put my bags in the    
 cloakroom.{Mr.Flux}did the register
