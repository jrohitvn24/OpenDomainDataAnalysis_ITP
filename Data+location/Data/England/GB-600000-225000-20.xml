		<content> At the moment the railway line between
 Liverpool Street Station, London, and 
 Norwich is being electrified. This    
 means that the{St. John's Bridge}has  
 had to be rebuilt. St. John's Road was
 closed from Christmas 1983 to March   
 1984 so that this work could be       
 carried out. The contractors were May 
 and Gurney.{Parsons Heath Bridge}also 
 had to be rebuilt, this time because  
 it was unsafe as trains were clipping 
 the inside of the bridge. They started
 the Parsons Heath bridge in September 
 1984 and hope to finish in the summer 
 of 1985. The rebuilding will cost     
 Â£500,000. The most important          
 construction vehicles being used are  
 the cranes because they can break up  
 the road and carry heavy objects.     
 There are 16 men, working 7 days a    
 week, day and night.
