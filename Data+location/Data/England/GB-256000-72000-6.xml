		<title>06Living on Dartmoor</title>
		<content> I like living on Dartmoor because it  
 is lovely,fresh and clean and people  
 are friendly.                         
   We get a lot of visitors down here  
 in the summer and it gets very busy.I 
 don't like it much then because I have
 to queue for ages at the shop.School  
 is fun and we use the swimming pool in
 the summer when it is hot.            
   The village has quite a lot for its 
 size and we have a newsagent,several  
 gift shops and a Post Office.We have  
 three cafes,a supermarket and an      
 excellent libary.                     
   You can go for long walks to the    
 tors which are all round us and there 
 are lots of{'Letter Boxes'}which you  
 can try and find.If you get bored     
 during the week there's Youth Club on 
 Tueday, Brownies on Wednesday,Guides  
 on Thursday and a Disco on Friday.    
  It's really fun living on Dartmoor.  </content>
