		<title>01HENHAM,WANGFORD INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   Our school is called  Henham School 
It is 100 yrs. old and has 40 pupils.  
Henham is not really a village anymore 
.It is just a few isolated cottages in 
the country near to Wangford.A long    
time ago there would have been more    
houses and people who worked on the    
estates of the Lords of Stradbroke.    
Wangford is now the village where most 
of the children who go to our school   
live.A really busy road called the A12 
goes past our school -it goes from     
Yarmouth to London Henham Park is a    
lovely big estate owned by Lord        
Stradbroke and it is right across the  
road from our school.Before the old    
Earl died (about  2yrs. ago) people    
could walk round the park free.The new 
Lord is called Keith and he has got    
lots of new ideas of what to do with   
the Park not everybody likes them.     
There is a Sunday Market in the park   </content>
