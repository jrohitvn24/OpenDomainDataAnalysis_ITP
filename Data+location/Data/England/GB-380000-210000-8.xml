		<content>  In the parish of{Harescombe}there are
 approximately 200 people. There are 6 
 farms, a village hall and a Women's   
 Institute. This Institute organises   
 entertainment for the village. At     
 Styles Farm there is dairy farming in 
 pastures, together with a few horses. 
 There are no shops or Post Office in  
 Harescombe and there never have been. 
 Villagers unable to travel usually    
 arrange for an appointed member of the
 communtiy to collect their weekly     
 pension for them from Stroud. The only
 deliveries are daily post and milk,   
 except on Sundays. Villagers say of   
 this area that there are more cows    
 than inhabitants! In the village there
 are just 20 houses, varying from      
 detached to older villas and cottages.
