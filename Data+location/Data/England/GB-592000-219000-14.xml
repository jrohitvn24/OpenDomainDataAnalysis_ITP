		<title>14PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>{ The Parish Council}meets once a month
 on the first or second Monday at the  
 Village Hall in Birch. There are seven
 members including the Chairwoman, Mrs.
 Crowe. They cover an area from the    
 Angel Inn at Heckford Bridge to the   
 Hare and Hounds in Layer Breton.      
  You have to be 18 to become a member 
 and you can retire when you like. At  
 the moment the parish council are     
 trying to get a pavement down the main
 road from the village to the school.  
 This is because the road is narrow and
 dangerous for pedestrians to use.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
