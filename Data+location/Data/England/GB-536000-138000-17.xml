		<title>17Primary School's Summer Term</title>
		<content> This term is the busiest of all.Our   
 talents and skills are used to the    
 full.A varied programme of work       
 continues despite many diversions.    
 SPORT                                 
 Schools in this area are fortunate in 
 having their own playing fields.Going 
 on the field at lunchtime is one of   
 the pleasures of this term.Though the 
 weather has been wet and cold,a full  
 range of games has been played.These  
 include rounders,shinty,stoolball and 
 nonstop cricket.All day children are  
 to be seen practising running,jumping,
 throwing and hurdling for school      
 sports day.They also have swimming    
 lessons in their learner pools at the 
 new leisure centre.Schools compete at 
 rounders, swimming and athletics.
