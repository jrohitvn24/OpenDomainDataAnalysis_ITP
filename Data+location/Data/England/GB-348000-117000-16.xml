     The drive is magnificently long &amp; 
 has not been used in many years.This  
 year ,though it has been used for the 
 carnival procession. This is far      
 different from the days when horses   
 used to pull carriages grandly up the 
 drive.                                
   Montacute is situated on the main   
 road A3088.Nowadays the village is    
 much more quieter as the new section  
 of the A3088 is used much more than   
 the old road.                         
    My friends are over in the         
 recreation ground on the BMX track    
 having glorious fun, jumping and      
 falling off,practising &amp; showing off. 
 Some of my other friends are playing  
 football trying to improve their      
 skills in order to become future stars
