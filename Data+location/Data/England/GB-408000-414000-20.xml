		<title>20Muslim Festivals - 'Eid'</title>
		<content>    When my family came back from      
 Pakistan we moved to Milnsbridge. One 
 of the Muslim Festivals we celebrate  
 is Little Eid. On 19th June, 1985 it  
 was Little Eid.I woke up at 6.00am.,  
 had a bath and got changed. I wore a  
 white dress with a red and white      
 jacket; red and white sandals and red 
 bracelets. I went downstairs to help  
 my mum cook the food for the feast. We
 made kebabs, samosas, rice, yogurt and
 fizzy pop.                            
    The men and boys ate first when    
 they had returned from the mosque. The
 girls played out while the ladies     
 talked.Then it was the ladies and     
 girls' turn to eat while the men      
 relaxed.                              
    My mum gave me Â£5, my dad gave me  
 Â£2 and my auntie gave me Â£3. I bought 
 my brother a dart game. My friend gave
 me an Eid Mubarak card.               </content>
