		<content>{St. Margaret's}church is Roman        
 Catholic.  It has been used as a      
 church since 1964.  Before this it was
 used as a school.  In 1978 it was     
 extended by John Turnbull and reopened
 as St. Margaret's in 1980.  It is     
 named after St. Margaret Ward, a maid 
 servant of the 16th century.  She     
 helped a prisoner escape in 1588 and  
 was hung.  The church holds 180       
 people.  Wet rot is a problem.  People
 who attend this church vary from 3 to 
 92 years old.  There is Mass on       
 Thursday evening and Sunday morning,  
 Sunday School is on Saturday morning. 
 Every Sunday about Â£100 is raised,    
 this is used for the upkeep of St.    
 Margaret's, to pay Father Marmion and 
 money is also sent to various         
 charities.
