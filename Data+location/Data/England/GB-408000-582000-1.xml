		<title>01Mid Wansbeck Valley</title>
		<content> This part of the Wansbeck Valley is   
 predominantly mixed farming. The      
 average farm size is 300 acres feeding
 cattle and sheep and growing fodder   
 and grain crops. Part of the area is  
 covered by deciduous woods which      
 provide shelter for houses, farm      
 steadings and animals. Most people    
 living in the area work in agriculture
 others commute to local towns or the  
 city. Town meets country when school  
 parties from local towns and Newcastle
 visit Marlish Farm. Bolam Hall has    
 been developed into a number of houses
 creating a new community, Bolam church
 has an active congregation holding    
 family services.
