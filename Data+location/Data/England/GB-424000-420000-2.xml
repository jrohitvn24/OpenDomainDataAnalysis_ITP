		<title>02DEWSBURY'S SHOPPING CENTRE.</title>
		<content> Much dissatisfaction is being shown   
 about shopping facilities in the town 
 centre.Many properties now display 'To
 Let' signs, this the result of high   
 rates and declining trade.Takings have
 been hit too by diversions and delays 
 caused by the start of a two year by- 
 pass scheme.Questions asked of local  
 shoppers in a newly-built shopping    
 precinct reveal disturbing features.  
 Good points did emerge-69% agreed     
 Dewsbury was good for shopping,and 62%
 said it was better now than it was 10 
 years ago.But 90% of all shoppers     
 admitted they preferred going to other
 places, namely Leeds, Wakefield and   
 Huddersfield. Shopping in near-by     
 cities has recently become more       
 attractive because of cheap bus travel
 during off-peak hours.The trouble with
 Dewsbury,shoppers said,was the parking
 problem and too few good shops.       </content>
