		<title>05EXWICK BAKERY</title>
		<content>  {British Bakeries}have a factory in  
 New Valley Road, Exwick. They make 16 
 different types of{bread}and the white
 sliced loaf is most popular. 1/4      
 million loaves are made each week and 
 each loaf takes 3.5 hours to make.    
 They also make some{buns and cakes.}60
 tons of flour are stored in each silo 
 and they use 80 bags a day.           
   The inside of the factory is hot and
 noisy. They use conveyor belts to go  
 around the factory carrying buns,     
 rolls, cakes and of course bread. Most
 jobs are done by{machines}but some are
 done by hand. The ovens are quite long
 and the bread is moved slowly through.
{400 people}work there 7 days a week   
 and they sometimes like their job.    
 Hats and overalls are worn to keep    
 germs away from the bread. Some of the
 staff drive big lorries and there are 
 over 50 delivery vans.                </content>
