		<content> Of 40 women questioned about their    
 leisuretime activities; 21 said that  
 gardening was one of their hobbies; 12
 said that knitting was a hobby; 25 had
 indoor hobbies other than knitting and
 keep-fit; 11 had outdoor hobbies other
 than gardening, including cycling (1),
 tennis (1), horse-riding (1), ski-ing 
 (1); 4 ladies went to keep-fit        
 classes.                              
 We concluded that more women (21) did 
 gardening than men (12); that men are 
 more active than women because three  
 quarters of the men took an active    
 part in outdoor sport and only just   
 over one quarter of the women took an 
 active part in sports.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
