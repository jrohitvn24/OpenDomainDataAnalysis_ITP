		<title>17PAPER INDUSTRY-LITTLE LEVER</title>
		<content> Brown paper was first made at Creams  
 Paper Mill in 1677 by James Crompton  
 on a site which had already supported 
 a water powered fulling mill for over 
 100 years.                            
   Now powered by electricity,and      
 controlled by computers since         
 1981,Creams employs 120 men and 3     
 women on a continental type,4 shift   
 system.                               
   Many types of corrugated paper      
 liners are manufactured from 300 bales
 of waste paper a day,supplied mainly  
 by charity collections.The liners are 
 used for packing purposes nationwide  
 and principal exports are to France.  
   In 1977 Creams Tercentenary Festival
 was held,since when a five a-side     
 football competition has been played  
 annually between Little Lever schools 
 for the Creams Trophy.
