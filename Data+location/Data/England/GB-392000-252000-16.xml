		<content> Public transport is scarce in this    
 very rural area. A Midland Red bus    
 passes through the villages once in   
 each direction on Wednesdays en route 
 from Worcester to Redditch. On        
 Saturdays a bus from Inkberrow to     
 Worcester and back also passes        
 through. School buses take the older  
 children to Worcester or Pershore in  
 the term time and will take other     
 paying passengers when possible.      
 Otherwise residents are dependent on  
 private cars - the majority of        
 households possess at least one, but  
 those without can be very housebound, 
 particularly the elderly and infirm.  
 Neighbours are often helpful in       
 giving lifts.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
