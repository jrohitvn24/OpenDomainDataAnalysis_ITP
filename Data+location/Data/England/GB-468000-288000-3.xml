		<content> Foxton has one church called          
 ST.ANDREWS.It is a Church of England  
 denomination and was built in Saxon   
 times.The old chapel was sold in 1984 
 and was bought and converted into an  
 art studio.                           
 Following the arrival of the prison in
 1967 Foxton County Primary School was 
 built to replace the old village      
 school.The old school is now a field  
 centre and used as a residential      
 training base for people studying the 
 canal.                                
 Gumley church is called St. Helen's.  
 There is a museum at Gumley.It is the 
 old butcher's house and is preserved  
 as it was in Victorian times.
