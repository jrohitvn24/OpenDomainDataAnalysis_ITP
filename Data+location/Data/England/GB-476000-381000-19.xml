		<content>{TRADE }There are three shops selling  
 groceries, vegetables and sweets.     
 One is also a Post Office, one sells  
 and delivers papers. Milk is          
 delivered to the door daily. Three    
 Public houses, one with Bar-food. Self
 employed carpenter, builders          
 and one cutting up trees for use.     
{RELIGION}There are churches in North  
 and South Leverton and in Sturton-le- 
 Steeple, 2 miles north: one Methodist 
 Chapel in North Leverton. Rev. Akerman
 in Leverton, Rev.Butt in Sturton.  The
 Methodist chapel is in the Retford    
 Circuit.  All have Sunday Schools, for
 children of about 3 to 14 years.      
 Churches do not have the influence    
 they once had but do have a place in  
 society.   There are pipe organs in   
 South Leverton and Sturton Churches   
 and a Hammond organ in North Leverton.
