		<title>20Haywood - other facts</title>
		<content>There are many other points of interest
in the area. There is a Moat at Colwich
which is said to have been a Roman     
Fort. It links with the path that is   
evident at Moreton House Farm. Local   
farmers call Coley Lane "Lonely Lane", 
some say because it was so lonely to   
walk along to school. Others say its   
name come from the Gypsies who lived   
there once. There are numerous Marl    
Pits locally. What the Marl was used   
for is the topic of much debate.       
The children of Anson School are       
indebted to the local people for the   
response they have received. Many      
people have contributed facts and      
thoughts, but special thanks must go to
The Meakin family at Far Coley Farm,   
and the Tabernor family of Moreton     
House Farm, Moreton Barn Farm and      
formerly of Moreton Farm. We spent     
hours with them.                       </content>
