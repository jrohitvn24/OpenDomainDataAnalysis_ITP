		<title>02LANDSCAPE OF THE TADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The area covered by this survey is not
 one community, it includes parts of   
 the parishes of Aldermaston, Brimpton 
 including Brimpton Common, Wasing and 
 Kingsclere, but in each case the      
 village centre is outside the survey  
 area, the majority of which is        
 farm land, woods and heaths; but the  
 south-eastern third consists of the   
 Atomic Weapons Research Establishment 
 at Aldermaston and the township of    
 Tadley including Baughurst.           
 The geology here is fairly simple. In 
 the north around Brimpton, in the     
 valleys of the Enborne and Kennet     
 rivers, there are rich deposits of    
 Alluvial and river gravels from which 
 a long, wide, south-west/north-east   
 trending ridge of Plateau gravels     
 overlying Bagshot Beds and London Clay
 (Eocene) rises to form the greater    
 part of the survey area.              </content>
