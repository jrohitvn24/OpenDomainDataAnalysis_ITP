		<content> On Fridays when I come home from      
 school I have to go to modern and tap 
 dancing.My mum does the food shopping 
 while I'm at dancing. Afterwards we   
 catch the bus home.Then I have dinner.
 I go to bed later on Fridays because  
 there isn't any school on Saturdays.  
 On Saturdays I get up and watch T.V.  
 until my mum gets up.I have breakfast 
 then I get washed and dressed. My dad 
 picks me up at 10-00.Then he has to   
 shift his drums from hotel to hotel.At
 12-15 he takes me to ballet.Then I go 
 back to his house for lunch.Later I go
 to my nans,or we go out. I sometimes  
 stay the night at my dads or I come   
 home in the evening.I go bed later on 
 a Saturday as well.On Sunday I play   
 with my friends.At 1-00 we have a     
 roast dinner.Then I go out to one of  
 my family.Bedtime is at the normal    
 time.{By Amanda Billings age 11       </content>
