		<content> A neat, attractive residential area,  
 with bungalows, houses, chalets and   
 flats. There are 5 private housing    
 estates, 1 council estate, and 2      
 pensioners residential homes, with    
 several more roads of mixed housing.  
 In Maldon Road there is an uninhabited
 derelict house and 4 beautiful        
 cottages, one built in 1508 called Ann
 Cottage. On Vicarage Pines Estate the 
 old Vicarage still stands. It was     
 built in 1906. The estate has grown up
 over the last 3 years, and has 52     
 dwellings. Permission is being sought 
 for 50 more. The Gleneagles Way Estate
 has roads named after famous golf     
 courses. Like Woodham Drive and       
 Ranulph Way, it is mainly detached    
 housing, built in the 1970's, with    
 lots of trees. There are well-kept    
 semi-detached council houses in       
 Remembrance Avenue and New Road.      </content>
