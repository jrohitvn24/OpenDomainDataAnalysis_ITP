		<title>13THE VILLAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content>PC Sharp came to Geddington 11 years   
ago after spending over 3 years in     
Kettering as a Beat Policeman. He      
enjoys the community involvement and   
wouldn't relish working in a town      
again.                                 
The work is sometimes tiring but the   
village is very quiet and incidents are
few. His area of responsibility        
stretches from Pipewell in the         
Northwest to Cranford in the           
Southeast.                             
His shiftwork is flexible to account   
for local activities such as evening   
Parish Council meetings or school      
cycling proficiency testing. Road      
accidents are his greatest source of   
distress and he regards the A43 as a   
most dangerous road. He maintains that 
village policeman are as generously    
equipped as their town counterparts.
