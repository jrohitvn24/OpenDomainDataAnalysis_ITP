Bowerchalke Post Office closed in 2003, residents now use the Post Office in neighbouring Broadchalke.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Landline telephone services are provided by the BT Rural Exchange at Broadchalke [Exchange code: STBRDCK  Postcode: SP5 5DJ].&lt;br />&lt;br />Broadband internet was enabed on the Broadchalke telephone exchange in Nov 2004 offering download speeds of up to 2Mbps.  This was upgraded to ADSL Max offering 8-24 MBps download speed in March 2006.&lt;br />&lt;br />Mobile phone coverage in the village is 'sketchy' - only the NE end of the village has 2.5G coverage (provided by the Orange Cell site on the high ground to the SE of the village).  There is no 3G coverage.   &lt;br />
