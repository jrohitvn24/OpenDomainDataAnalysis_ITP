		<title>05Life styles - Family holiday</title>
		<content> This year we are going to Cornwall for
 our summer holiday, we have been there
 twice before and we shall stay for two
 weeks.  For the first week we shall   
 stay in a farmhouse at St. Ives, and  
 then we shall go to Helstone on the   
 Lizard Peninsula.                     
 The total cost for food and           
 accommodation will be Â£504 for the    
 four of us.  The journey from our home
 near Huddersfield will be             
 approximately 300 miles, and the      
 petrol at Â£1.99 per gallon will cost  
 us Â£40 for the return journey.  The   
 journey will be motorways.            
 My family usually have two holidays   
 each year.  We have two weeks in the  
 Summer, and a shorter one of four or  
 five days which we spend nearer home.
