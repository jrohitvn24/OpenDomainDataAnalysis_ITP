		<title>05PARK HOUSE FARM LAYER MARNEY</title>
		<content> Mr and Mrs J Strathern are arable     
 farmers. They own three hundred acres 
 of wheat, barley, oilseed rape and    
 potatoes. In 1951 Mr R Strathern owned
 the farm and in the early seventies   
 his son took over. They have thirty   
 beef cattle and seven hundred turkeys 
 for Christmas.                        
 The farmhouse was built in 1952. The  
 six grain silos hold one hundred tons 
 of wheat or barley. They own a combine
 a digger, four tractors and they do   
 contract mole draining with           
 caterpiller tractors. They have one   
 full time worker. The major changes   
 they have seen are in the different   
 kinds of machinery - fewer men are    
 needed to do the work. He gets up     
 about six and has his breakfast at    
 nine. Mr Strathern always wanted to   
 farm because he likes watching things 
 grow.                                 </content>
