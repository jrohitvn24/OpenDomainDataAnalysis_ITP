		<content> Delrow College and rehabilitation     
 centre is located in square 05140197  
 in the settlement of Patchetts Green. 
 Delrow House dates from the 17th      
 Century and still has a delightful    
 Jacobean stone fireplace. The site    
 covers 30 acres and has been developed
 with educational and residential      
 buildings of mixed architectural merit
 since the Camphill Village Trust      
 aquired the site in l963. The         
 trust,founded by Dr.Karl Konig,       
 provides private non-profit making    
 institutions to which children,       
 suffering from a wide variety of      
 handicaps and disturbances can be     
 referred. They receive care, treatment
 and education until they are of school
 leaving age. The rehabilitation centre
 runs as an integral community in which
 staff and children live together in   
 households.                           </content>
