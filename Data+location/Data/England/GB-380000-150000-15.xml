		<content>  I  shop  in the village store and the
 post office for things like bottles of
 drink,   ice - lollies   and   sweets.
 Sometimes  my  mother   goes  to   the
 Village  Shop but  she mostly shops at
 Safeways   in    Frome,   Tesco's   in
 Trowbridge  or  Sainsbury's  in  Bath.
 Most  of  my  friends'  mothers  go to
 shops like Safeways or Tesco's. People
 normally  shop   more  in   big  shops
 than  little  shops because the bigger
 shops are  cheaper and  there is  more
 choice.                               
  The  book shop is hardly used and you
 do not see any-one in  it although the
 cane shop down the road is used  quite
 a lot.                                
  The  Cane  Shop   sells  things  like
 presents,  pictures, baskets, wrapping
 paper, cards, bamboo chairs and bamboo
 mirrors. They also sell  soaps, pencil
 sharpeners, ash trays and much more.  </content>
