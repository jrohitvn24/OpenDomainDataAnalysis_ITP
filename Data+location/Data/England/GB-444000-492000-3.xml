		<content> Apart from grass, wheat and barley are
 the main crops grown.The barley is    
 sold for malting and for export to    
 Germany and the Middle East whilst the
 wheat is used for flour.A limited     
 amount of oil seed rape is grown      
 too.In future we may grow peas and    
 linseed.                              
 3 men work the farm,one man can milk  
 60 cows per hour.At busy times such as
 harvest and silaging we may bring in  
 extra labour.                         
 Today farming is more of a business   
 than a way of life.Large amounts of   
 money have been invested in milking   
 parlours,grain dryers etc. and more   
 artificial fertiliser is applied      
 producing more grass on fewer         
 acres.Artificial insemination has been
 a great step forward in animal        
 breeding,we can use top class stock on
 our animals.                          </content>
