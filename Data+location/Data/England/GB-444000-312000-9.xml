		<content> First the stone is{unbared}by removing
 the top soil.This is dumped on a large
 tip which is being landscaped and     
 farmed.Next men {drill }holes of      
 13cms. diameter vertically into the   
 rock to hold the explosive powder.    
 Then{blasting}blows the rock away from
 the hillside. The stone is taken to a{
{processing plant}and the waste is     
 removed. The stone is crushed in the  
 Primary Crusher,then goes underground 
 and onto a{conveyor}to be taken along 
 for more crushing, milling and grading
 The end product is then ready for     
 selling and transporting.There are    
 ten different grades of stone.        
 We stood about half a mile away to    
 watch a{blast}in progress. We saw the 
 explosion before the sound reached us.
 It left a pile of rock and a large    
 cloud of dust drifted towards us.
