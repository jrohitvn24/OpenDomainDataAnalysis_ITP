		<content>Our block is in a conservation area.   
It is what the politicians might call a
green belt, and there are lots of      
things in it which people today fight  
to conserve. Some of these things are  
footpaths; canals and animals and      
birds. At least one of the declining   
species of bird is in our block,that is
the barn owl. We cannot be sure it has 
a nest but we do know it is present    
because not long ago we found about    
twelve pellets  and studied them in    
school to find out what the owl had    
been eating.                           
As our village is near the sea we do   
not get much snow because the salt air 
quickly melts it.
