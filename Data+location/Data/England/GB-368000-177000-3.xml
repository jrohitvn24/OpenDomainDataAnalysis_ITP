 busiest day is Saturday when{lessons  
 or{rides}are given to about 30 people 
 who mostly come from{Yate}as well as  
 some from Filton. The rides go along  
 the{bridle paths}towards the M4       
 motorway.                             
  Eachday the owner and helpers have to

 and muck out the stables. Horses and  
 ponies are exercised everyday. Most   
 of the horses are bought privately but
 three are kept and looked after for   
 other owners. The people who work at  
 the stables enjoy their work very     
 much.                                 </content>
