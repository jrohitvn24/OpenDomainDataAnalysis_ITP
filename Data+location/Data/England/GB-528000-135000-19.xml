		<content> A day in the life of Keith.           
 In the orning I wake up and play for a
 rew minutes and then go into my Dad's 
 room to do some reading.Then I would  
 have breakfast and I would have       
 Weetabix, Frosties, Rice Crispies,    
 Cocopops, Cornflakes, Kellogs Special,
 Start Porrige and that was all the    
 cerials. Other times I would have     
 bacon and eggs or toast with lemon    
 curd on and then I would have a wash  
 and get my school uniform on.By then  
 my mum would take me to school and I  
 would go into school and I would go in
 and hang my coat up and then line up  
 for Assembly. An Assembly is a thing  
 that all the people in the whole      
 school meet together and we talk about
 something then we read and do all     
 sorts of things. After school I have a
 sweet or something then I watch T.V.  
 and then have tea and go to bed.      </content>
