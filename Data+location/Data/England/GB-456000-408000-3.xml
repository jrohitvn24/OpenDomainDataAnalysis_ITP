		<title>03Life at Thorpe Marsh Reserve</title>
		<content>{Thorpe Marsh Nature Reserve}is jointly
 owned by the{C.E.G.B.}and the         
{Yorkshire Wildlife Trust,}and they are
 most intrested in the animals there.  
 The pond is a perfect picture with the
 coots running across the water like   
 ghosts. In the reserve field office   
 there is a display of stuffed         
 birds.Under the names there are labels
 in braille so that there is a chance  
 for blind people to get to know the   
 birds.There are two resident wardens  
 and 27 voluntary wardens.The voluntary
 wardens don't have special duties, but
 the resident wardens do. They make    
 sure that the reserve is kept tidy,   
 that things are not damaged, and also 
 that there are no dogs on the reserve.
