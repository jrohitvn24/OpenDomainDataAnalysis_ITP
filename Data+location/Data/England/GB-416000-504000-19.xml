		<title>19GILLING WEST SCHOOL 1930s</title>
		<content> Gilling School was built in 1847.     
{Fifty years ago,}there were a{hundred 
{pupils,}in{three classes,}and{three   
{teachers,}one being the Head. The     
 lessons were{Reading,Writing}and      
{Arithmetic.}The older children went on
{Nature walks,}to identify birds,trees 
 and flowers. Naughty children were    
{caned}with an ash cane. The children  
{sat in rows,}facing the black- board. 
 At play_time every pupil had 1/3 pint 
 of milk to drink. At play-times,boys, 
 girls and infants were separated.     
 At lunch_time,most children went      
 home.Those who lived on outlying      
 farms took sandwiches to eat in       
 school. When the children were{ten    
{years old,}they sat an{examination.   
 Those who{passed}went on to attend the
{Grammar School in Richmond,}otherwise 
 they{stayed at Gilling}until they     
 reached the{school leaving age of 14. </content>
