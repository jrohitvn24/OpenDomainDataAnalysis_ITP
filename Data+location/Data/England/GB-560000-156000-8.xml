Green County Primary {School}. We are  
aged 5 to 11 years, and we are at

weekdays starting at 9 a.m.  We have   
seven teachers including a Head.       
   Every day we have Maths., English   
and Reading. We do Science, History,   
Geography and Religious Education as   
projects. We also have Art, Handwriting
Needlework, Craft, P.E., Games and     
Swimming.                              
   We have a {computer} day once a week
when we go on our two {computers}.     
   On Saturday morning in the Summer   
there is Swimming in our pool, and in  
Winter there is Football, run by the   
parents. Parents also help in school   
hearing reading and doing cooking with 
the children. (by R.Layberry,S.Whittle
