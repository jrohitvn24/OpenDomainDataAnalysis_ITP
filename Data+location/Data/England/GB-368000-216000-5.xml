 Edwin Crawshay.It has had various     
 owners, Peter Stubbs, Mr McIver. For a
 short spell no-one lived in it and it 
 was used as a country club. In{1933}at
 an auction{Fr.Tozzi and Bishop William
{Lee}purchased the land and buildings  
 for Â£3,000. They opened the Hall as   
 the{Salesian School}of Agricultural   
 and Allied Trades. Boys of thirteen   
 and fourteen, mostly orphans, stayed  
 there and learned carpentry,shoe      
 making horticulture and engineering.  
 In 1950 it changed to a special school
 for boys with educational or emotional
 difficulties.New buildings were added 
 in 1965. In addition to a normal      
 education there are facilities for    
 sport,trips etc at weekends. The care 
 staff are all from the Salesian order.
