		<content> I get up at quarter to eight in the   
 morning,get dressed and go downstairs.
 I have toast and orange juice for my  
 breakfast and leave for school at     
 quarter to nine.I walk 0.5 Km.At ten  
 to nine I reach school and sit under  
 the big oak tree with my friends      
 Edmund and Steven.Our teacher knocks  
 on the window at nine o'clock and we  
 go in to start work.We have a lesson  
 from the bible,sing a hymn and say a  
 prayer then start Mental Arithmetic   
 and Scottish Primary Maths.We watch a 
 television programme most mornings,   
 these include Picture Box,A Place to  
 Live,Science Workshop and Animals in  
 Action.Picture Box is usually a film  
 to stimulate creative work and A Place
 to Live is about animals,birds and    
 insects and their environment.We have 
 playtime at ten forty and come in at  
 eleven to do more sums.               </content>
