		<content>   I did a test on how many people in  
 my class have things that help you in 
 the home.I found out that 6 people in 
 my class have a microwave, 24 people  
 in my class have a cooker, 24 people  
 in my class have a frige or a freezer,
 17 people in my class have a tumble   
 dryer, 24 people in my class have a   
 washing mashine, 7 people in my class 
 have a dish washer, 23 people in my   
 class have a telephone, 24 people in  
 my class have a T.V, 15 people in my  
 class have a video, 13 people in my   
 class have a computer, 15 people in my
 class have a food processer. The      
 numbers are not quite right because 5 
 people were away when I asked them.
