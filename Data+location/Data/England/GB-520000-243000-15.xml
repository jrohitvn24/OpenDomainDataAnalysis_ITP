		<title>15Kennel Farm.</title>
		<content>   Kennel Farm was built in 1927. It is
 owned by Beds. County Council. The    
 farm was originally used to house the 
 dogs used in hunts, but now it grows  
 cereals, some cabbages and sprouts.   
   Mr and Mrs Boddington live on the   
 120 acre farm. The fields range in    
 size from 6 to 30 acres. They own 3   
 tractors, 1 combine harvester, 1 fork 
 lift truck and a plough. They are kept
 in one of the storage barns on the    
 farm. The other barn is used to store 
 harvested crops.                      
   There is some woodland near the farm
 but the surrounding land is mainly    
 agricultural land.
