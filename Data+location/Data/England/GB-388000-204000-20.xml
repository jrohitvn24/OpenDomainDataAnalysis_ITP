		<title>20BISLEY'S PAST REPUTATION</title>
		<content> Now largely a dormitory village for   
 the surrounding towns, Bisley was once
 the centre of a much larger parish    
 (including Chalford and Oakridge until
 the late 19th century), most of whose 
 inhabitants were engaged in woollen   
 -cloth manufacture.  In 1831 the      
 population was nearly 6,000 making    
 Bisley one of the largest parishes in 
 the county, but by then Glos'shire    
 cloth trade had gone into a sharp     
 decline and Bisley especially was     
 suffering massive unemployment with   
 the bulk of the population having to  
 be relieved by the Parish Poor Law    
 authorities and the village workhouse 
 always full of paupers. From this time
 comes the catch "Mincing Hampton,     
 Painswick Proud, Beggarly Bisley and  
 Strutting Stroud." And the response to
 "Where are you from?" "From Bisley,   
 God help us! "                        </content>
