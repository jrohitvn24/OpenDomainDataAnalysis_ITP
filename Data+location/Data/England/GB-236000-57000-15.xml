		<title>15CUMBLE TOR - TREMATON</title>
		<content> Cumble Tor is a farm of some 130 acres
 standing near the village of Trematon.
 It overlooks the River Lynher and has 
 been in the hands of the same family  
 for hundreds of years. Most of the    
 present barns were once used as the   
 farm house or as workers cottages, and
 there are the remains of at least one 
{clombe oven}in one of these barns. The
 previous farm house was built in 1840 
 by a member of the same family as the 
 present owners.                       
 Cumble Tor is a farm with a long      
 history. It is described by the owners
 as a farm of yesterday and a farm of  
 tomorrow. The farm is reached by a    
 single broken track, Cumble Tor Lane  
 which passes between fields of Barley 
 fodder and rough grazing. This is a   
 mixed farm, with 50 sheep and 100     
 cattle as well as market garden crops 
 and cereals.                          </content>
