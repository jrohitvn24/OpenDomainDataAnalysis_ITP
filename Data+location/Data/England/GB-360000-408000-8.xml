		<title>08HOUSES IN ASPULL</title>
		<content>   The people of the area are a mixture
 of the old generations of{Aspullites} 
 and newcomers to the new housing      
 developments. Very few foreigners have
 settled in the area.                  
   The locals speak with a broad       
 Lancashire{dialect}and are usually    
 good neighbours, but are seriously    
 being affected by the high rate of    
 unemployment in the 1980's.           
   The property in the village varies  
 from old miners cottages to terraced  
 houses, council estates and a variety 
 of private dwellings, thus catering   
 for many classes of people. Many of   
 the older properties have been        
 attractively renovated.               
  {Aspull}is now a dormitory village   
 for the people who work in Wigan,     
 Bolton and the surrounding areas, also
 providing access to the{M61}via Bolton
 road for routes to the north and east.</content>
