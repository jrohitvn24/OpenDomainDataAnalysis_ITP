		<title>20THOUGHTS ON DOMESDAY PROJECT</title>
		<content>  The history we have learnt about at  
 school has always been much more      
 interesting when it has been about    
 particular people.We wonder if some of
 the things we do will seem strange to 
 people in the future.We like 1985!    
  Changes happen very quickly,ask our  
 grandparents,but it's difficult to    
 imagine what there is left to         
 discover.We hope that there will be   
 peace in the world,nobody will be     
 starving and that the doctors will    
 find ways to stop lots of the         
 diseases.                             
  We enjoyed working on The Domesday   
 Project.It was good to do work that   
 was going to be useful.We think that  
 computer discs are a good way of      
 storing information but hope that they
 won't replace books completely.       
  Good luck to the whole project from  
 Lyngford Park County Primary School.  </content>
