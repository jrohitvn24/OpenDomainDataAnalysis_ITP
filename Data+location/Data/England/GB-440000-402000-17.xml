		<title>17All Saints Parish Church</title>
		<content>    The Parish Church was founded in   
 Anglo Saxon times, though now the     
 earliest parts date back to the Norman
 Conquest.  The Tower contains 8 bells,
 the oldest dating from 1616.  For 25  
 years the bells were not rung because 
 the noise exacerbated mining          
 subsidence. The interior of the church
 is very impressive, with a 14th       
 century nave and chancel.             
    The church looked after the        
 original parish of Darfield, which    
 consisted of the 7 local villages.    
    The churchyard contains some       
 interesting graves.  The most famous  
 person buried there is Ebenezer Elliot
 a poet. The church also contains      
 memorials to the men that died in th  
 1857 and 1886 local colliery          
 disasters,when 199 men and boys were  
 killed at the local pits.
