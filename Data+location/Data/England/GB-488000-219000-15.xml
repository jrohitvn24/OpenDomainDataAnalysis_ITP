		<content> Ledburn, in the parish of Mentmore,   
 consists of 33 dwellings on either    
 side of a through road. These include 
 2 timbered houses, several cottages,  
 an 1895 terrace of 4 farm labourers'  
 houses, 4 modern bungalows, 3         
 detatched and 4 semi-detatched houses 
 and a Queen Anne manor. Apart from a  
 public house, a 'phone and a post box,
 residents have to travel 3 miles for  
 all amenities. Milk and papers can be 
 collected daily from a central point. 
 The bus calls twice a week. Less than 
 half the residents are local people   
 though more than half the working     
 population work in nearby towns. The  
 proposed{Leighton Buzzard ring road,} 
 though causing villagers a big detour,
 will reduce the speeding traffic, the 
 main cause for concern amongst the    
 villagers of an otherwise peaceful    
 hamlet.                               </content>
