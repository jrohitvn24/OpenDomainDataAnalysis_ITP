		<content> There are many different sorts of     
dwellings including farm houses,villas 
cottages,semi detached,detached and    
bunglows in this area.Cotton Hall Farm 
has many rooms and out houses. By      
Faber School,built in 1847,there are   
semi detatched and terraced houses,    
wich were built between 1809 and 1973. 
The oldest houses are St. Teresa's     
Cottages.The Old Star Public House,now 
called Star Green Farm,used to be The  
Blazing Star when it was a Public      
House because a local furnace used to  
smelt Iron and Copper in about 1780.   
Some old furnace bricks were seen by   
Mr Cope at Star Green when his present 
home was built.Another large building  
is Whiston Hall built about 1875 and   
now the home of Tom Copper who runs an 
18 hole Golf Course and provides bar   
facilities for visitors,who pay 100    
pounds per year for membership.        </content>
