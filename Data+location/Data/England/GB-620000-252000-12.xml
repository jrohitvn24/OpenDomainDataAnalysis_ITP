		<title>12HOUSING IN CLOPTON</title>
		<content> The village of Clopton is made up of  
 some council owned houses, 7 or 8     
 farms and other widespread houses.    
 Quite a few of the houses are old and 
 there are one or two large houses in  
 the area including a 'Hall' built in  
 the Tudor style. The odd house has a  
 thatched roof or is painted in the    
 traditional 'Suffolk Pink'.           
 There is not much new building going  
 on at present.                        
 The houses are serviced by all the    
 mains services except gas.
