		<content> The{largest employer}in our area is   
 Shulton's. They manufacture after     
 shave lotions and perfumes and are    
 famous for 'Old Spice'. We visited the
 factory and were given a guided tour. 
 They employ about 300 people, 200     
 women and 100 men. Shulton's have been
 in Seaton Delaval for 20 years. The   
 firm began in New York in 1934. About 
 10 people work in the canteen and when
 we went for our visit we were given   
 orange juice and biscuits there as    
 well as many samples of their         
 products.                             
 The factory works a{main shift}from 8 
 am to 4.30 pm except on Fridays when  
 they finish at 12 noon.               
 We saw the{packing line}in operation  
 and we were told that the three lines 
 each cost approx. Â£250 000!           
 The trip was very interesting and     
 enjoyable.                            </content>
