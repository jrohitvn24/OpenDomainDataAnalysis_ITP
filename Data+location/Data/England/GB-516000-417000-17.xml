		<title>17The Lighthouses: Function.</title>
		<content> In{1920}the original equipment in the 
 High Light was replaced by a          
 vapourised petroleum system.It was    
 electrified in{1950.}There was a Chief
 Keeper at High Light.He had an        
 Assistant Keeper at North Low,but this
 has been demolished for many years.The
 lighthouses formed a triangle.The High
 Light, the leading light, is at the   
 apex.This works with South Low to     
 guide ships through the deep water    
 channels between South Killingholme   
 and the Lower Humber and Goole.The    
 leading light can be seen from{14}    
 miles away.Before{1950,}visibility was
 only{11}miles. The lighthouses are now
 run by Associated British             
 Ports.Previously they were controlled 
 by Humber Conservancy Board,until{    
{1908,}then British Transport Docks    
 Board until{1965.
