		<title>07THE MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>The M40 extension will run right       
through Otmoor. Otmoor is a home for   
lots of wildlife especially birds      
because a lot of Otmoor is wet         
and marshy which the birds like. The   
noise of the motorway will disturb the 
peace. The fumes from the cars might   
pollute the air and water,and poison   
the animals. The motorway will run     
through lots of peoples' land and even 
through some barns. The River Ray,which
lots of people fish in,will have to be 
drained for the motorway,and will      
vanish completely. The workmen have    
already started draining Otmoor. The   
motorway will bring lots of commuters  
to live in Charlton-on-Otmoor and the  
surrounding villages.The motorway is   
being built make the journey to        
Birmingham from London shorter by 17   
minutes!
