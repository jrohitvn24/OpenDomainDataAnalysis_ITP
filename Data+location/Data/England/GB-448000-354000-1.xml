		<content> Kirkby is primarily a mining and      
 industrial community,having a shopping
 centre at the junction of two major   
 routes:theB6020 Kirkby Cross -        
 Ravenshead,and B6021 Annesley-Sutton. 
  Coal has been the backbone of the    
 economy since the late 19th century,  
 though the textile industry has been, 
 and remains, important.Since the      
 closing of Kirkby Colliery,there has  
 been a substantial broadening of the  
 industrial base.Collieries adjacent to
 the area have remained the largest    
 source of jobs,with new industrial    
 estates along the old railway and     
 colliery sites.                       
  Central shops principally sell       
 convenience goods and provide basic   
 services.                             
 Outside the built-up area land uses   
 are agriculture,forestry and mineral  
 extraction,with 'pockets'of Green Belt</content>
