		<title>12Describing My house</title>
		<content> My house is on an estste and is semi- 
 detatched. The roof has grey tiles and
 a brick chimney. It has a glass and   
 wood door. The windows are large,     
 double glazed with metal frames. The  
 walls are brick but some of the       
 upstairs walls have tile facing. Under
 the windows at the front has tile     
 facing. There is an extention at the  
 back. The kitchen and dining room were
 extended and a new bathroom built. At 
 the back the windows are casemant with
 wood frames and no double glazing.    
 There are metal-framed patio doors on 
 the new dining room. I have been      
 living there for nearly 13 years. It  
 is a fairly old estate. There are 4   
 bedrooms, kitchen, dining room, lounge
 hall, bathroom, toilet, landing, and  
 an attic. I love my house! Juliet
