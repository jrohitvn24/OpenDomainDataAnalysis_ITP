		<title>01THE PARR AREA OF ST.HELENS.</title>
		<content>     Our  area  of  study  is  mainly  
 residential, with some light industry,
 some farmland and some derelict land. 
 It has been an established industrial 
 area since the late eighteenth century
 but  very  few  of  the original heavy
 industries    now    remain,    Bold  
 colliery, Bold Power Station  and  the
 United  Glass  Bottle  Works being the
 only  exceptions.  The country's first
 industrial  canal  has  been in disuse
 now for  over half a century, although
 Britain's first  passenger  railway is
 still one of the areas main links with
 Liverpool and Manchester.             
     Recent years have seen a number of
 attempts by the local  authority, both
 to conserve our industrial past,in the
 Sankey  Valley  Project,  and  to     
 redevelop industrial spoil heaps  into
 Parkland, Fisheries  and  Industrial  
 Estates.                              </content>
