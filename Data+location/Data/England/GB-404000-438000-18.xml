		<content>    The lower pastures are divided into
 irregular fields bounded by dry-stone 
 walls of the locally extracted        
 sandstone.                            
    Most of the farms in the area are  
 of comparatively small acreage and    
 concentrate their activities on a     
 mixture of dairy and sheep farming    
 along with the cultivation of         
 grassland for silage and pasture.     
    A number of the farms have         
 diversified to provide facilities such
 as riding stables and kennelling for  
 pets.                                 
    The only amenity in the area is    
 "The Guide" public house which is     
 appropriately positioned on a         
 crossroads.  The present building     
 dates from 1930 and was built to      
 replace a former inn, "The Awd        
 Gawmless" which stood a few hundred   
 yards away towards Cullingworth.      </content>
