		<content>{SHOPS}In the area contained in this   
 block there are several shopping areas
 for the people of Speke and Hale,     
 which employ a number of persons to   
 serve and run the shops.              
 There are several mobile shops which  
 tour the streets and roads selling    
 eggs, potatoes and other produce.     
 A number of people who live in small- 
 holdings and in Hale Village sell home
 grown produce from their houses.      
{STREET MARKETS}Each Thursday and      
 Saturday an open Market is held on a  
 Council site between the Housing      
 Department Offices and the Swimming   
 Baths. The stall holders arrive early 
 and set up various stalls of clothes, 
 china and food stalls.                
 In{Hale}there is a long history of    
 street markets dating back hundreds   
 of years, and recently these have been
 revived.                              </content>
