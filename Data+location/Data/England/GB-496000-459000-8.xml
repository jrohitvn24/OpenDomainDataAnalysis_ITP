		<content> There are a number of pig farms in the
 area.Pig farming is profitable because
 large quantities of grain are grown on
 wold farms.Mr C owns a large  farm of 
 2,200 pigs.He employs three men who   
 work eight hours a day.At the weekend 
 two men work a seven hour day.        
 The pigs spend their entire lives in  
 covered pig units.They are fed on a   
 compound ration purchased from Feedex 
 and Bibby.                            
 Mr C buys boars from pig companies    
 such as Newsham Hybrids of Malton.    
 His pigs are troubled with respiratory
 complaints such as pneumonia and      
 colds.He sells his pigs to a firm     
 called Feedex who process them for    
 pork and cutter.
