		<title>11Farming, Fruit Growing</title>
		<content> Fruit growing in this county is       
 dominated by cider. The firm of       
 H.P.Bulmer in Hereford is the largest 
 cider producer in the world, and many 
 orchards of cider apple varieties have
 been planted to supply it. These      
 varieties are specifically for cider, 
 not for eating, as they have high     
 tannin and acid content. The trees are
 grown in grass and in the past were   
 standard trees tall enough to allow   
 sheep to graze beneath the branches.  
 Nowadays bush trees are grown at a    
 closer spacing. Mechanical harvesters 
 are being developed. In addition to   
 cider orchards, one fruit grower with 
 30 acres grows several varieties of   
 apples and pears for sale from the    
 farm, and also runs a Pick-your-own   
 enterprise. Two other small market    
 gardens supply the public with fruit  
 and vegetables.                       </content>
