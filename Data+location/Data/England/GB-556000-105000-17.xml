		<title>17ABBOT'S WOOD/WILMINGTON F.</title>
		<content> ABBOT'S WOOD IS A PART OF WILMINGTON  
 FOREST-A WORKING FOREST COVERING 880  
 ACRES.25% OF THE TREES ARE BROAD      
 LEAVED-OAK,BEECH,POPLAR,BIRCH,ALDER,HO
 RNBEAM.THE REST ARE MAINLY CONIFERS-  
 CORSICAN PINE,NORWAY SPRUCE, WESTERN  
 HEMLOCK. THE FOREST PRODUCES @ 1400   
 TONS OF TIMBER A YEAR.                
 THERE ARE MANY LOVELY WALKS AND A     
 SMALL LAKE WHICH CAN BE FISHED. THERE 
 ARE MANY WILD BIRDS INHABITING THE    
 FOREST AND IN SPRING WILD FLOWERS ARE 
 EVERYWHERE. THERE ARE SOME VERY LARGE 
 NESTS-UP TO 3 FEET HIGH WHICH HAVE    
 BEEN BUILT BY WOOD ANTS FROM FOREST   
 DEBRIS. RABBITS,FOXES AND BADGERS ARE 
 FOUND IN THE WOOD.                    
 I LIKE ABBOT'S WOOD BECAUSE THERE'S A 
 LAKE WHICH IS GOOD FOR CATCHING DACE. 
 ALSO IT'S GOOD FOR ITS WILD LIFE      
 ESPECIALLY A GOOD SELECTION OF BEETLES
