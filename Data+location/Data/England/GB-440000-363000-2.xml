 On Saturday mornings I wake up at     
 about 8.30.I get dressed,go downstairs
 and have cornflakes.After that I      
 used to play on my bike but I can't   
 now because my bike is in pieces.So   
 now I usually go and wake up my       
 brother  and we have a game of        
 football across from my house.At about
 10.30 I call for Paul Vickers and he  
 and I call for Christopher            
 Gratton.Then we play football on the  
 school field.As there are only 3 of us
 I borrow Andrew Bailey's bike to      
 collect some more friends.When we     
 start the game of football it is      
 nearly always 4th years against 3rd   
 years.Matthew always wants to play    
 centre-attack and I always want to    
 play centre-midfield because that is  
 my favourite position.
