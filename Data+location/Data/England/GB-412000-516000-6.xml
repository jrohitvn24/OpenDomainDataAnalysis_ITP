 The former village school, which now  
 attracts weary travellers to stop and 
 rest at the "Bridgewater Arms".  In   
 1850 it echoed to the sound of twelve 
 boys and girls receiving istruction in
 the art of reading and writing.  For  
 this  the master received the sum of  
 Â£70 per annum. Children now travel to 
 Gainford Primary School or Staindrop  
 or Teesdale Comprehensive School.  At 
 the "Bridgewater Arms" you may quench 
 your thirst and order a "whale and    
 chips".  The "whale" refers to a      
 generous portion of  fish which hangs 
 over the plate.  Te "Bridgewater Arms"
 enjoys patronage  from a wide area.
