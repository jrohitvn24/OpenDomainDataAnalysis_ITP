		<title>19Education in Halewood.</title>
		<content>    Pre-school education is not very   
 well catered for in Halewood. There is
 only one day nursery in our survey    
 area. There are, however, a couple of 
 playgroups run by local organisations.
    The falling population of Halewood 
 (although it has recently remained    
 stable) has meant that schools have   
 become much smaller. All but two of   
 the local schools have had their      
 infant and junior departments merged. 
 There has also been the closure of one
 Catholic primary school.              
    Secondary education is limited to  
 one county school and one Catholic    
 school with a total of 1400 pupils. A 
 secondary school has recently closed  
 and there are moves to close the      
 Catholic school.                      
    There are no facilities for further
 education, but the county secondary   
 school runs adult education classes.  </content>
