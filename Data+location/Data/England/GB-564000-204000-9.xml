		<title>09WRITTLE, VILLAGE CLUBS</title>
		<content> Writtle has many clubs ,in fact nearly
 fifty .Perhaps one of the reasons for 
 this is that it has a lot of children.
 Nearly all the village children can   
 attend and some are just for the      
 children.Another reason for there     
 being so many clubs is that it has    
 many places to hold them in.There is a
 large community centre called         
 Longmeads.In the summer you can have  
 fun days where you can do many        
 different activities.Next to the 13th 
 century church is the modern Christian
 Centre where Sunday School is held.   
 Also held there is Brownies and       
 Guides.The more sporty clubs are held 
 down Paradise Road where there is a   
 large playing field.On it Writtle     
 Minors the local football club train  
 and play.The Scouts and Cubs hold     
 there meetings in the ancient hut at  
 the top of the playing field.         </content>
