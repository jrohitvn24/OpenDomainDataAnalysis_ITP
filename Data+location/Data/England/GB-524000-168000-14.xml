		<content>  I live in a old semi detached house  
 in Gladstone Road ,South Wimbledon.I  
 go to Pelham Primary School which is  
 not far away.I only have to cross     
 three roads to get there.Tesco's is a 
 large supermarket opposite my house   
 and we often shop there as well at the
 other shops on Wimbledon Broadway     
 which is at the end of my road.South  
 Wimbledon and Wimbledon Stations are  
 quite close by.There are two theatres 
 and a cinema on the Broadway.We went  
 to the cinema once to see "Jungle     
 Book".We also have two parks quite    
 near that we often visit and a library
 from which we borrow books.
