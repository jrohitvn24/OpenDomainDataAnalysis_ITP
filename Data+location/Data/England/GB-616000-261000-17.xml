		<title>17Attitudes in Debenham (1).</title>
		<content>  The people of Debenham have mixed    
feelings about village expansion.Many  
express fears that the new housing will
destroy the architectural character and
quiet charm of the village.Opinions    
vary about the quality of the design of
the new housing.                       
  It is felt that if the village grows 
too large,the community spirit may be  
destroyed.There is anxiety that schools
and leisure facilities may not expand  
to keep pace with the influx of        
population.                            
  On the other hand,some people believe
that an increase in population is      
necessary to maintain the existing     
level of facilities.Many would welcome 
more information about these.          
  Opinions are divided about the new   
plastics factory,some considering it   
inappropriate in a rural area,others   
welcoming the prospect of more jobs.   </content>
