		<title>01STOKE GOLDING AND THE FENNS</title>
		<content> Mixed farms spread evenly across the  
 flat, drained countryside. Fields,    
 crossed by a network of streams, are  
 divided by hedges with occasional     
 small deciduous woodlands planted for 
 the use of the Atherstone Hunt. In the
 north eastern corner development of   
 the Bosworth Battlefield includes new 
 footpathsm a nature reserve along a   
 disused railway and horse-drawn barge 
 trips. To the south west Stoke Golding
 stands on rising ground, the Ashby    
 Canal winding around its outskirts.   
 Most villaes commute but some find    
 work at three small textile factories 
 and an electronics factory in the     
 village. Other sources of wmployment  
 are the butchers and abattoir, a      
 hairdressers and seasonal canal boat  
 hire business. Craftsmen include a    
 builder, carpenter, painter and       
 decorator and a signwriter.           </content>
