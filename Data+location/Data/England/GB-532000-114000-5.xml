 Sunday School attached to the church, 
 a Women's Fellowship and a Mothers'   
 Union.                                
 The Unitarian Church was originally   
 the meeting place of the General      
 Baptists;the '5 Mile Act' debarred    
 them from worshipping within 5 miles  
 of the town.The present minister also 
 officiates at Unitarian Churches in   
 Lewes and Brighton.
