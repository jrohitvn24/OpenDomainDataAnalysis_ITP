		<title>13The Elderly in Appleby</title>
		<content>    In Appleby there are four places   
 where elderly people can be cared for.
 There is Edenside where there are     
 helpers who make the old people's     
 meals.Edenside is a very big place and
 it is by the river Eden.              
    St Annes has a little yard with    
 eleven houses around it,the proper    
 name for these houses is              
 Almshouses.They have their own little 
 chapel too in the yard.The Almshouses 
 are up Boroughgate near the Castle.   
    Rampkin House is up Scattergate it 
 has some flats which elderly people   
 live in with a warden in charge to    
 look after them.Rampkin house is down 
 Scattergate Close near a farmers      
 field.I used to have a great aunty who
 lived in Rampkin House.               
    There is also another house in     
 Scattergate where four old ladies live
 on their own.        Caroline Jacks   </content>
