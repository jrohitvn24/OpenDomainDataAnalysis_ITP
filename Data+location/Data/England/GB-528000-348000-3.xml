		<content>     The farms in our area are a       
 mixture of tenancies and owner-       
 farmers.The largest farm in our       
 area is part of a larger farming      
 company, and employs about 11 men and 
 a few students. The farmer considers  
 that they are conservationists and    
 look after the wildlife of the        
 area.They worry most about the        
 weather. The 2 seasons they like best 
 are springtime when every thing grow  
  and summer when they combine the     
 crops. The EEC has made a difference  
 with the farms ,it gives  subsidies   
 although there were some before       
 joining the  EEC. Farming has changed 
 a great deal over the years, we have  
 entered the mechanical age .Horses    
 have gone and  most of the men because
 of the machinery ,they had 18 horses  
 on the farm 18 years ago now there are
 none.                                 </content>
