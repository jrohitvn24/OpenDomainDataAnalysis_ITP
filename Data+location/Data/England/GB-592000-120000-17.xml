		<title>17New Sluice Gates in Rye</title>
		<content>  On Thursday 2nd May 1985 we went     
 across the road to ask the keeper of  
 the new sluice gates a few questions. 
 He told us that the gates cost 2.5    
 million pounds to build, but 3 million
 when the old locks are knocked down.  
 The gates are automatic and the lock  
 keeper only has to go and see them    
 when they go wrong. They built the new
 ones because the old ones were too old
 and rotten. They are easier to work   
 than the old ones and it took 15-17   
 months to build them. A sluice gate is
 needed to stop the place from flooding
 because we usually have a lot of high 
 tides.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
