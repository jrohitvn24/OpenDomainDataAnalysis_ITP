		<content> Our area is very rich in wildlife.On a
 typical summer's day these are the    
 common birds you would see: rook,     
 carrion crow, jackdaw, woodpigeon,    
 magpie, blue tit, great tit, hedge    
 sparrow, song thrush, blackbird and   
 chaffinch. By Ashton  Brook you can   
 sometimes see mallards flying around. 
 If you are lucky you would see a      
 kestrel or a sparrow hawk hovering and
 diving down on field mice. You might  
 see a yellow hammer, greenfinch, or   
 goldfinch; and over at Peel Hall there
 is a resident barn owl. Down Grange   
 Road you can come across spotted wood_
 peckers or you can hear them. In some 
 of the ponds in the area (for instance
 at Dunns Lane) there is lots of life. 
 We have found waterscorpion, caddisfly
 and much more. Some of the ponds in   
 this area are used as dumping grounds 
 and so is part of the brook.          </content>
