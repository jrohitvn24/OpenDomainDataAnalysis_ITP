 86,000. Older people come here to     
 retire. Also older people come here to
 the many rest homes. Holiday tourists 
 come here to the fun fair, beach,     
 theatre and other items of            
 entertainment. Most of the population 
 have a car or some other means of     
 transport, although older people      
 like going by bus. Just under one     
 quarter of the population of Southport
 is of a pensionable age. As a result  
 of this there are many rest homes. By
