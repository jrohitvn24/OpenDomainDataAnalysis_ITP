		<content>  {St.Barnabas' Church}has red and     
 orange bricks and black slates.It was 
 built in 1904 and changed its name to 
 St.Barnabas in 1913.There are three   
 lancet windows and the east window is 
 in decorated style.We have a bell on  
 top of the west side.On top of the    
 door there are herring-bone patterns. 
 The foundation stone says "To the     
 Glory of God.This stone was laid by   
 George D.Faberson MP on 5th March     
 1905." Inside the church there are    
 brick arches and wooden vaulted       
 ceilings.At the very back there is a  
 font.                                 
  On Sunday morning we go to church at 
 10.00 o'clock.When we get there we put
 our stars on our names and go in with 
 our friends for service.Sometimes all 
 the{Sunday School}children have to go 
 up to answer questions about God      
 before we go downstairs in our groups.</content>
