{Vandals in Peterlee}break into shops, 
 schools and houses. They break in just
 because they think that they are      
 clever.                               
                                       
 Sometimes, when they break into the   
 shops they steal things but at other  
 times they just smash things up. They 
 throw bricks at doors and windows.    
 Sometimes they kick the doors down.   
                                       
 In{Peterlee}there is quite a lot of   
{graffiti}on walls. When people write  
 on walls they are just showing off.   
                                       
 Some of the{dogs in Peterlee}are not  
 looked after properly. They are just  
 left to roam about the steets,        
 sometimes in packs, and use the       
 pavements as their toilet.
