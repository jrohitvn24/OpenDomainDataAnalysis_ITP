		<title>06ROMAN ROAD NEAR ANDOVER</title>
		<content>     Arrowing its way across our area  
 from east to west runs the course of  
 an{ancient Roman roadway}known as the 
{Port Way.}Little exists of it today   
 although a map or aerial view reveals 
 it clearly and several modern roads   
 and tracks follow its course.         
     In its day it was apparently one  
 of the{major east-west routes}used by 
 the occupying Roman armies of the     
 first few centuries A.D., running from
 Silchester in the east through to Old 
 Sarum, and on towards the south-west. 
     Although no one seems very sure,  
 the general opinion appears to be that
 the road lost much of its importance  
 with the departure of the Romans, and 
 long sections of it were abandoned in 
 early Saxon times.
