		<content>                                       
 The outside of the fort is whitewashed
 and on the inside it is made of brick.
 It was built between 1865 and 1869 and
 is now used as a museum. There is a   
 prisoners cell on view with a hatch   
 where food was passed through and the 
 only light came through a barred      
 window. On the top of the fort,40lb   
 guns were placed in each corner and   
 the soldiers lived in the barrack     
 rooms. The fort is hexagonal in shape 
 and from the top is a very good view  
 of Freshwater,Totland and Yarmouth.   
 The fort was re-opened in May 1985,as 
 an art and craft centre with gift     
 shops,blot-art work, woodwork,etc. on 
 display.
