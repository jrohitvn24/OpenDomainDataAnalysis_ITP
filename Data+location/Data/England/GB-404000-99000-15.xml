		<title>15RECREATION BREAK DANCING</title>
		<content>{Break dancing}is a modern form of     
 dancing. The moves can be spinning on 
 parts of the body, such as the hand,  
 back or head, more difficult moves    
 such as spinning on your shoulders    
 with your legs apart, called a        
 windmill, and other moves such as the 
 pinwheel. This is done with one leg   
 stretched out and the other one bent. 
 You put your hands on the floor in    
 front of your body, move the straight 
 leg round (forwards) and when it gets 
 to your other leg, you jump. You      
 repeat this process until you want to 
 stop. Scramble is somewhat like a     
 pinwheel but both legs go round and   
 you make a kind of twist half way     
 through. You use your hands to push   
 yourself round. We practise at the    
{Youth Club}and won a competition at   
 Poole Quay.  We call ourselves "street
 names" e g Micro Turbo Machine and TJ.</content>
