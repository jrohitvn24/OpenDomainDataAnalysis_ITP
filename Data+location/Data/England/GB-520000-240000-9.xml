		<content> ARTS AND CRAFTS: We do not have any   
 people who make their living by their 
 craft in our survey area nevertheless 
 both art and craft are popular        
 pasttimes. Many traditional crafts    
 particularly have been revived in     
 recent years like macrame and         
 lacemaking and have been taught by    
 local people at impromptu classes.    
 We also have one very popular local   
 hobby artist : Colin Crocker          
 HOBBIES: We conducted a survey of     
 people's hobbies in our area and were 
 amazed to learn that there were at    
 least as many different hobbies as    
 people! Many people are involved in   
 active sports like badminton,squash,  
 sailing or golf. Yet the most popular 
 were gardening, reading, sewing,      
 knitting and walking. Other interests 
 include philosophy, watching TV, jig- 
 saws, photography and computing.      </content>
