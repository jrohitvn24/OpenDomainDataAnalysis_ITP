		<content>{Probus Demonstration Gardens          
 These gardens are situated beside the 
 main trunk road A390 east of the      
 village of Probus.They are run by the 
 Cornwall Education Committee and are  
 probably unique in Europe.Their       
 purpose is to help all gardeners;for  
 the home gardener to show how he can  
 improve and make the best use of his  
 garden;for the architect &amp; town       
 planner to improve the landscape of   
 towns &amp; villages;&amp; for schools in     
 Cornwall to provide them with plants  
 for teaching purposes,&amp; to show the   
 close connection between plants &amp;     
 medicine,history &amp; geography.         
    They were established in 1971 by   
 Mr.Blake,the County Adviser for       
 Horticultural Education.He chose this 
 exposed hillside site of nearly 7     
 acres to show that plants grow well   
 under adverse conditions.             </content>
