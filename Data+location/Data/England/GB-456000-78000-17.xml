		<content> Most of the rubbish on the beach      
 between Horse Ledge and Appley Steps  
 was near the breakwater. This is      
 because the sea washes against it and 
 brings the rubbish with it. The kind  
 of rubbish found was drink cartons and
 ice cream wrappers, probably from     
 ships, and from people having picnics 
 on the beach. {Fishing.}For fishing,  
 the season and the time are not       
 important. A good catch depends more  
 on the tide. People fish on the end of
 the pier. They catch Cod, Whiting,    
 Pout, Crabs and Weavers. The amount   
 they catch can be a matter of luck.   
 Some of the fish cannot be eaten, like
 Weavers (stinging fish) and small     
 crabs. There is pollution in the bays 
 and harbours.
