		<title>12Crop Spraying.</title>
		<content>{Peter Scott}has his own farm in Thorpe
 Audlin. He is a{crop sprayer}and gave 
 us some information about the         
 operation.                            
 The most common crop is{wheat.}       
 Ladybirds are useful to the crops     
 because they eat the aphids which are 
 the most common and most harmful pests
 on the farms today. The other pests   
 are{bladder podge midge, seed weavil  
 and the{common beetle.}Pests like     
 these harm the crops by eating them   
 and spreading disease. Little of the  
 crops are taken by pests because Peter
 controls them, if he didn't they would
{damage 50% of the crop.               
 The sprays that Peter uses are        
{fungicide,insecticide and herbicide.} 
 These sprays don't harm wildlife.     
 Each field is sprayed{three times a   
{year.}The tank delivers{ten gallons to
{an acre.}                             </content>
