		<content>The way to pick a site is not where the
site is situated but how much the land 
will cost,and if it is available for   
building on.When building a house the  
contractors are not worried what type  
of surface they build on,concrete or   
grass.The reason they didÂ£nt use the   
larger area of the disused airfield is 
because it is going to be used for     
light industrial use but not for       
building.The houses are built for three
types of people they are as follows:   
1.The married couple with children.    
2.The married couple with no children. 
3.Old age pensioners.                  
On the whole site 24 houses are planned
to be built.So far out of the 24,6 of  
the houses have already been purchased.
The area surrounding the building site 
is not being put to any further        
use.Plans for the old farmhouse are to 
restore it not demolish it.            </content>
