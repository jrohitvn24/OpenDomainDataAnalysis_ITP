		<content>    Housing in and around Ellesmere    
 Port has changed radically during the 
 last 30 years. There has been{little  
{high rise development,}but large      
 housing estates, both privately and   
 council owned have been built.The most
 common and popular form of housing is 
{Semi-detatched property,}in line with 
 the trend of{lower density}housing.   
    Some estates are designed with a   
 theme running through the main plan   
 allowing minor variations to generate 
 individuality. In recent years this   
 individuality has been achieved with  
 various styles and types of houses on 
 the same estate. Many{council tenants 
{have bought their house and made      
{improvements.                         
    The sheltered form of accommodation
 (warden assisted accommodation) is the
 housing of the future as the number of
 old people increase.                  </content>
