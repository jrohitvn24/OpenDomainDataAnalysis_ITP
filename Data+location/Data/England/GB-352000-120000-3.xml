		<title>03An archaeological dig</title>
		<content>{  Tea breaks}were a welcome chance to 
 gather at the tea tent, ease aching   
 muscles and discuss the latest finds  
 and their significance.               
   The{"Finds" caravan}was a           
 fascinating place where a jumble of   
 fragments would grow into a carefully 
 glued together pot.How much more      
 impressive the restored object was    
 than its scattered fragments.         
   Many{Roman finds}were made including
 numerous{coins,}some very corroded    
 but others with their inscriptions    
 still clearly legible.                
   Another interesting find was an{iron
{overshoe}that Roman horses are        
 believed to have worn in our muddy    
 conditions.                           
   Altogether the dig was a fascinating
 project which raised considerable     
 local interest and drew in many local 
 volunteer helpers.   Mr.Peter Cutts.  </content>
