		<content>   The region consists mainly of an    
 area of farming, interspersed with    
 patches of woodland. It extends from  
 the outskirts of{Hutton}to{Billericay,
 and includes much of the Parish of    
{Mountnessing.}The landscape is        
 generally flat and stands some 50m    
 above sea level, being drained by the 
{River Wid}and its subsidiary streams, 
 flowing NE. The population in the N   
 and W is sparse, being settled around 
 a dozen farms.{Mountnessing Hall}and  
 the adjacent{Church}are dominant      
 features in the area.                 
   The SE corner of the grid includes  
 the expanding{Queens Park Estate,}    
 which is a recent extension of an     
 established residential area.         
   In recent years, light industry has 
 grown up around the{Billericay Railway
{Station.}
