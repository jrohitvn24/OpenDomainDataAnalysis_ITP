		<title>07THE OWSLEBURY WARRIOR</title>
		<content>    In Owslebury we had an             
 archaeological dig in Mr.P.Hellard's  
 grounds. An Iron Age warrior was      
 found. It was called the "OWSLEBURY   
 WARRIOR" and it had been preserved on 
 Mr Hellard's property for about two   
 and a half thousand years.            
    A few days after the arcaeoloigical
 discovery of the "OWSLEBURY WARRIOR", 
 a worker on Mr Hellard's farm, called 
 Bottom Pond Farm, hit some stones     
 whilst ploughing a field. After       
 further investigation the             
 arcaeologists were recalled and       
 started a further dig.                
    After three to five years work they
 found out that they were the remains  
 of Iron Age and Romano-British        
 settlements.                          
    The "OWSLEBURY WARRIOR" is now in  
 the CITY MUSEUM IN WINCHESTER.
