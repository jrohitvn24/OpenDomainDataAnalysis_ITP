		<title>11THE NATIONAL WIRELESS MUSEUM</title>
		<content>  This museum is at Arreton Manor on   
 the Isle of Wight.  It has a unique   
 collection of vintage wireless        
 receivers dating back to the first    
 World War.  Here can be seen crystal  
 sets with cats-whiskers and           
 headphones, antique receivers with    
 "bright-emitter" valves, and curved   
 horn loudspeakers - as used when      
 broadcasting from 2LO which commenced 
 in 1922.                              
    Dozens of period components are    
 shown, as used by home-constructors,  
 and there are wireless periodicals    
 popular over half a century ago.      
    Later exhibits include so-called   
 "portable" sets of truely gargantuan  
 proportions - and weight! - also the  
 luxury consoles and radiograms of the 
 thirties.
