		<title>04SCAMPTON C.E. CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in Scampton, Lincolnshire  
 is dedicated to St.John the Baptist.  
 It is made of lime stone and has a    
 tower. One of the three{bells}was cast
 in 1582. The window in the South      
 Chancel is 14th century and shows St. 
 John about to be beheaded. There is a 
 plaque and a banner on the South wall 
 dedicated to the association between  
 the R.A.F. and the village, also the  
 remains of a leper window. The first  
 incumbent was Richard Blunt in 1238.  
 The present incumbent is Rev.C.M.H.   
 Frere. There is the possibility of a  
{ghost}believed to be the Rev.John     
 Haggard, priest here for 58 years; who
 died in 1782. The graveyard contains  
{Royal Airforce}graves of which 72 are 
 British, 12 Canadian, 9 Australian, 3 
 New Zealand and also the graves of 8  
 German aircrew.
