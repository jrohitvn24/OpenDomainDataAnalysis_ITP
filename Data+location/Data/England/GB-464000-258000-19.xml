		<title>19A HEALTHY DIET</title>
		<content>There has been a lot of talk recently  
in the media about the fact that we are
not eating a 'healthy diet'. We are    
supposed to be eating too much fat and 
not enough fibre, amongst other things.
We decided to do our own check on how  
{healthy} our diet was. We kept a      
record of everything that we ate for 24
hrs &amp; then processed it through our    
computer, using a program called DIET. 
We have averaged out the results and   
they are as follows:                   
Average Requirements for 24 hrs        
Energy  Protein Fat  Carbohydrate Fibre
 9.73Mj 56.18g  76g   280.1g      28.4g
Average Intake over 24 hrs             
Energy  Protein Fat  Carbohydrate Fibre
10.55Mj 74.32g  93g   354.4g      28.2g
{We would seem to be eating too much   
protein, fat and carbohydrate - as the 
media says - but we are just about     
right on fibre, contrary to the media}!</content>
