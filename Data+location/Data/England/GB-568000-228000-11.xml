		<title>11GT BARDFIELD WATERMILL PART2</title>
		<content> Every bit of equipment is still intact
 except the engine which was used more 
 recently. There was another mill on   
 the site before the stone mill was    
 built. At that time the flood gates   
 were situated further up river where  
 2O years ago there was a weir built as
 an attempt to stop the mill flooding.
