		<title>10BARLBOROUGH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in the village is called   
{St.James}church.The entry in the      
{Domesday Book}links Barlborough with  
 Whitwell and states that one Priest   
 served both villages.                 
 It is evident that there was a church 
 in Barlborough in early{Norman times  
 and it is most probable that this was 
 a{Saxon building}replaced when the    
 church was rebuilt by the Normans in  
 the latter half of the{12th century.  
 Of this Norman building the only part 
 left is the very fine Norman arcade   
 built about 1170.The remains of an oak
 beam which probably at some time      
 supported a Rood screen, can be seen. 
 The lower part of the tower and the   
 chancel arch are both early English,  
 probably built about 1280-1290,while  
 the Tower Arch is a very good example 
 of a five pointed gothic arch.        
 Restoration in the 18th century       </content>
