		<title>08WANSFORD COMMUNITY LIFE</title>
		<content>  Our questionnaire about community    
 involVement was returned by a majority
 of adults and old age pensioners which
 we felt reflected the village         
 population.  The Wansford area has    
 a church, Women's Institute, British  
 Legion, Evergreen Club and a few      
 smaller organisations which offer     
 community involvement.  The response  
 to the questionnaire indicates that   
 the church and the Women's Institute  
 are the most popular institutions.    
 Although 43% of all the responses said
 they only attended uillage events once
 a year, 16% and 18% attended village  
 events once or twice a fortnight      
 respectively.                         
   Many people felt that all age groups
 were served adequately by the local   
 clubs, but a few thought there was    
 a shortage of facilities for the      
 younger generation.                   </content>
