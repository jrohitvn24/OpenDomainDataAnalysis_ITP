		<title>10THE PRINTING WORKS</title>
		<content>  Inchbrook Printers was started in    
 1946 although at that time it was     
 called Abbey Press. Inchbrook's       
 offices are in a building that is     
 about 200 years old and used to be a  
 pub called "The Dog and Badger". The  
 company prints forms which customers  
 have designed for their own use and   
 are no good to anyone else. None of   
 its products are sold in shops.       
  101 people are employed by the       
 company. Most of them live in         
 Kingswood or in the nearby villages.  
 The workers have different working    
 hours; some start early and finish    
 early while others start and finish   
 later. The factory employees do not   
 require any special clothing but are  
 provided with overalls if they wish.
