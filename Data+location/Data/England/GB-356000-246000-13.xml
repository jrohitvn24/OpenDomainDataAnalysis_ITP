		<title>13St. Michael's Church, Felton</title>
		<content> The church is a Victorian stone       
 building on a medieval foundation.  It
 was rebuilt in 1852 after a fire and a
 new stone vicarage was constructed    
 alongside it.  The church consists of 
 an aisle, chancel and wooden-spired   
 tower with five bells.  The parish of 
 Felton is now amalgamated with Preston
 Wynne Parish.  The vicarage is now a  
 private house.  One communion service 
 is held every second Sunday.  There is
 a combined service with other parishes
 once a year.  The church possesses a  
 unique alter frontal and panels       
 designed and embroidered by a         
 Herefordshire artist.
