		<title>10Ecology of Horse-Eye Level</title>
		<content> Horse-Eye Level is of great interest  
 from an ecology point of view. It is  
 mainly grazing meadows intersected    
 with fresh water dykes. High water    
 levels in winter attract large numbers
 of wildfowl. The area comes under     
 Sussex Trust for Nature Conservation &amp;
 is also a Bird Protection Area. As    
 well as the Yellow Wagtail which is an
 important breeding species, other     
 birdlife found in the area includes   
 Swans, Herons, Seagulls, Crows,       
 Lapwings, Partridge, Sparrows,        
 Redshank &amp; Snipe. Other wildlife      
 inhabiting these levels include       
 Otters, Mink, Frogs, Molluscs,        
 Butterflies, Dragonfly, Perch, Roach  
 and Rud. Sussex is now the main       
 British stronghold of the Dragonfly - 
 latin name Brachytron Pratense - and  
 Horse-Eye Level is one of the two most
 important sites in the county.        </content>
