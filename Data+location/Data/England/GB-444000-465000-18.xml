     The houses in this area lie mainly
 in the village of Tholthorpe although 
 there are farm houses away from the   
 village.  Most farms have tied        
 cottages for their workers.  There are
 6 council owned houses and 2 which are
 rented privately and there are also 3 
 furnished holiday houses and 3 holiday
 flats.  The owner occupied dwellings  
 are a mixture of old and new houses   
 and a few bungalows.  Their exteriors 
 are finished in a great variety of    
 styles and one feature of 10          
 successive houses is that their rooves
 are alternately tiled (red) or slated 
 (grey)and this theme has been         
 continued on 2 which have been        
 recently built.  Older houses have    
 undergone modernisation inside and    
 out some with rear extensions         
 utilising old bricks.                 </content>
