		<title>08LETTERS TO SOUTHPORT VISITOR</title>
		<content>                                       
 Many people who live in Sefton,a      
 district of Merseyside,are pleased    
 with the suggestion by certain local  
 political parties that we leave this  
 county and return to Lancashire.Most  
 people are not happy that rate payers 
 money is being spent on things that   
 Liverpool City Council want and not   
 on the amenities Southport needs.     
   Another topic is the wierd one of   
 dogs off their leads in the Botanic   
 Gardens in Southport.The problem is   
 getting worse and lots of people are  
 worried about it.A man who wrote to   
 the editor said "On Sunday I took my  
 daughter to the childrens playground  
 in the Botanic Gardens-she slipped and
 fell in a load of dog dirt".He carries
 to say how he saw at least two signs  
 saying "dogs must be kept on a lead"  
 but saw five dogs without leads.      </content>
