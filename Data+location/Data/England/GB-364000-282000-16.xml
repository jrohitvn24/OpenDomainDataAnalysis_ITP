		<title>16A STOTTESDON CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>{My name is Suzy.}I am 10. I wake up at
 6am. The cat jumps on me, and nibbles 
 my toes. The next thing I do is make  
 my bed. Mum makes breakfast. I have   
 Cornflakes. Mrs Howells takes us to   
 school in the taxi. I have sandwiches 
 for lunch. My favourite sandwiches are
 egg and chives and salad cream. I go  
 home the same way I came. I watch     
 telly and then have tea. I go to bed  
 and read, at about 9 o'clock.         
{My name is Richard.}I am 8. I wake up 
 at 8 am. The cars wake me. I go and   
 have breakfast, then I get dressed. I 
 brush my teeth then I wash my face,   
 and then I go to school. Jenny takes  
 me in her car. I have school dinners. 
 Jenny takes me home, or sometimes Mum 
 walks to fetch me. I watch telly,     
 then I have tea. Sometimes we have    
 curry. Then I go to bed at 10 o'clock.
