		<title>19THE MIDWAY SURGERY</title>
		<content> We had a surgery in the{Doctors       
 home in Watford Road in 1953. Our     
 doctor,Dr.Jackman and his wife ran    
 this, but soon there were so many     
 patients that the surgery was not     
 large enough.Then the doctor moved    
 to No.2 Midway.A playroom was         
 converted to a waiting room.In 1961   
 all was ready for patients.In 1979    
 there were three doctors working the  
 area{population}was increasing, a baby
 clinic was set up.Soon this surgery   
 was overcrowded_to work and wait      
 in.Plans for a new surgery were laid. 
 The Doctors had two and a half years  
 to plan a design that was to be unique
 in Hertfordshire.Others were visited  
 faults noted and the{new Midway       
{Surgery}was built to their own        
 design.Clinics held are general       
 surgery,well woman,and baby clinic.It 
 is a friendly place with 4 doctors.   </content>
