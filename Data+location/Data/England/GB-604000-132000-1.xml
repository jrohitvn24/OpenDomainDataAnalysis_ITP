		<title>01Bilsington! Hill &amp; Marshland</title>
		<content> Most of the area is part of the       
 Rommney Marsh criss-crossed by        
 drainage dykes and is intensively     
 farmed.   Mixed arable &amp; the local    
 'Rommney' sheep dominate with some    
 areas on the marshes, several square  
 kilometres are not crossed by road or 
 footpath.   However the track of the  
 CEGB pylons carrying power from       
 Dungerness is a stark contrast.   At  
 the edge of the marsh is the old canal
 used by anglers extensively as it is  
 well stocked and, unlike the dykes, is
 never drained.  North of the canal the
 land rises steeply and although mostly
 unmanned grazing land some woodland is
 found which stretches into larger     
 areas in adjacent grids.   The only   
 major town, Bisilington offers little 
 but peace, quiet and quaintness.      
 Looking south from the Bilsington Road
 you can see to Dungeness &amp; appreciate </content>
