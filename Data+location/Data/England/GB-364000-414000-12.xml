		<content> The Blackburn and District{Playbus}is 
 a place of{recreation}for{pre-school  
 children.It has two full time and two 
 part time{helpers}.The mums have to   
 pay  70p for the children to use the  
 Playbus.It comes to Belmont on        
 Tuesdays and Fridays,staying for      
 two hours each day.About 7-15 children
 attend.The Playbus is sent to Belmont 
 because it is a small place and there 
 are no playgroups in the village.The  
 children are encouraged to make use of
 all the Playbus facilities.           
 "Messy" play - sand, water, modelling 
 and painting - is done downstairs.    
 Upstairs is a quieter area with toys  
 and a Wendy House.The children are    
 given a drink and biscuit. They are   
 encouraged to produce a picture,      
 listen to stories and join in songs.  
 In good weather a slide and inflatable
 are used outside.                     </content>
