		<content>  One of the aims if the{Peak Park}is  
 to conserve the landscape of the area 
 and there is a great{awareness}as well
 as an inevitable{conflict of interests
 in this field.                        
  Planning controls on building aim to 
 conserve a{traditional}look to the    
 landscape, extensions to industry and 
 quarries are considered very carefully
 and the{impact of tourism}and         
 transport on the landscape has to be  
 met.                                  
  A number of national and local groups
 are actively involved in conservation 
 activities such as planting trees,    
 wildflowers or protecting wildlife etc
 There is a mixed response to these    
 activities from local residents who   
 may be involved or may consider their 
 rights to be at risk. The Primary     
 School  has developed a{conservation  
{area}with trees, a pond etc.          </content>
