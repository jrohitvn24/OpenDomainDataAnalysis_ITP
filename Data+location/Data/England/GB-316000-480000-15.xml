		<title>15MY LAST DAY AT INFANT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I HAVE JUST HAD MY LAST DAY AT THE    
 INFANT'S SCHOOL AND NEXT YEAR I AM    
 GOING TO BLACK COMBE JUNIOR SCHOOL.   
 MY FAVOURITE LESSON WAS PE. I LIKED   
 BIG APPARATUS WHEN WE GOT THE CLIMBING
 FRAME AND THE SLIDE OUT. ON OUR TRIP  
 THIS YEAR WE WENT TO LOTS OF PLACES.  
 WE TRAVELLED ON A COACH TO BOWNESS, A 
 STEAMER TO LAKESIDE, A STEAM TRAIN TO 
 HAVERTHWAITE, THEN ON AN OLD BUS TO   
 HOLKER HALL. THE BUS WAS THIRTY YEARS 
 OLD. AT HOLKER HALL WE SAW THE MOTOR  
 MUSEUM AND PLAYED IN THE ADVENTURE    
 PARK. WE LOOKED AROUND THE CHILDREN'S 
 FARM. IT COST SIX POUNDS FOR ALL OF   
 THE TRIP. I LIKE DOING PICTURES IN THE
 AFTERNOON AND PLAYING WITH TOYS. I    
 LIKE DOING WORK SOMETIMES, DOING MATHS
 BUT I DON'T LIKE DOING THE REST OF THE
 THINGS. MY BROTHER GOES TO MY NEW     
 SCHOOL AND MY DAD IS A TEACHER THERE.
