  The oldest houses in the villages    
 date from 1700's and there are ap-    
 proximately four of them of this age. 
 The two villages have not grown much  
 in the last decade because only ten   
 houses have been built in that time.  
 Most were built 10-30 years ago.Here  
 is a breakdown of age/number of houses
