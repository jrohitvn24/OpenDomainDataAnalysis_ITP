{Clubs}- The{Fellowship Group          
                    - by Antonia Payne 
                                       
 On Tuesdays, at seven o'clock, most of
 the young people meet at Pytchley     
 School.  Our ages range from seven    
 to fourteen years.  As we enter, we   
 pay ten pence.  We gather and talk and
 then are quiet.  We sing a songs and  
 then we say our prayers.  These are   
 lead by Father Gatenby, our vicar.  We
 then play{games}such as Ladders,      
 Bulldog and Kingball.  Later we have  
 refreshments of orange and biscuits.  
 This is followed by{discussion}groups.
 We talk about things that are going on
 in the world and how we can prevent   
 bad things happening when we are      
 older.  We go home at half past eight.
