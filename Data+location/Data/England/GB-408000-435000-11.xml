		<title>11MY DAY, BY KATHRYN AGED 13</title>
		<content> My name's Kathryn, and I'm 13 yrs old.
 Weekdays, I have to get up at 7:15am. 
 Then I go down stairs and have my     
 breakfast at 7:30am. Then quickly get 
 washed and dressed for 8:00am, setting
 off for school at 8:15am, and arriving
 by 8:45. The school bell rings at     
 8:55am. After registration and        
 assembly, lessons begin at 9:20am.    
    School finishes at 3:30pm. I get   
 home at about 3:50pm.I usually help   
 make the tea and have it about 5:00 to
 5:30pm. I then do my homework at about
 6:00pm, if any. I usually go to my    
 friends, or go to the local youth     
 club. I have to be home at about      
 9:00pm. I have supper,and then get    
 washed, and remember to brush my      
 teeth.I sometimes read in bed before I
 go to sleep.                          
                                       
                                       </content>
