		<title>20Attitudes to Village Life</title>
		<content>   This survey was made by the children
 of All Saints' Primary School. They   
 asked why people liked living in this 
 area?                                 
   It was obvious that everyone enjoyed
 the peace and quiet of a small        
 community rather than the bustle of   
 town life. Being only 7 miles from    
 Burton upon Trent and convenient for  
 roads to larger towns and cities was  
 seen to be an advantage. Many of the  
 necessary amenities were available.   
 The facilities lacking included social
 activities for teenagers, a village   
 hall, and tennis courts. Some would   
 like street lights, but others would  
 not. The majority of children like the
 country life too, being able to play  
 in the fields and on the farms,       
 particularly with the animals, but    
 they would prefer more children to    
 play with, and more local shops.      </content>
