 The foundations of Boston Stump were  
 laid in 1309.They say it was built on 
 wool,they say it because the wool     
 trade brought in more than enough     
 money so they built a Church in name  
 of St.Botolph who is supposed to have 
 founded Boston.The height from the    
 ground level to the tip of the tower  
 is 272ft.The length of the Church is  
 282ft and the width is 100ft.The total
 area of the whole Church is more than 
 20,000 square ft.The knocker on the   
 door dates back to the mid 12th       
 century and it is older than the      
 Church itself.Anyone who grasped the  
 knocker was considered to come under  
 the protection of the Church and so   
 immune from arrest.The Church gained  
 its nickname because the tower took so
 long to complete.
