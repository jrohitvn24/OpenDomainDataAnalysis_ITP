		<content> Pigeons and other wild_life cause     
 farmers a great deal of trouble so    
 they use a scarer that sounds like a  
 gun. Scaring starts at 0530 when the  
 sun rises and stops at 2030 when it   
 sets. Sometimes the farmer builds a   
 hut with straw bales. We went in one. 
 It was very cosy indeed. The farmer   
 hides in the hut and shoots at birds  
 which attack his crops. We climbed on 
 top of the hut but as soon as I stood 
 up it caved in. Fortunately the hut   
 was soon rebuilt. To stop rabbits     
 getting into the crops and to keep the
 sheep out there are a number of fences
 made of wood and wire mesh. A new one 
 recently cost Â£10,000 and was erected 
 by the Council who look after the     
 Nature Reserves to prevent wild_life  
  attacking the crops.
