		<content> There is{contrast}between those whose 
 horizons are limited to the parish    
 and those whose finances, education   
 and careers enable them to take a     
 broader view. Each group has value in 
 the community. Extremes of fashion do 
 not feature. There are{no problems of 
{drug or race,and only minor vandalism.
 A hairdresser's shop and 2 travelling 
 home hairdressers serve the vicinity, 
 whilst mobile library, butcher,       
 greengrocer and fresh-fish vans supply
 everyday needs. Six public houses and 
 a restaurant/nightclub attract        
 visitors from Teesside. This is the   
 only public{entertainment}for the     
 community, who tend to create their   
 own social functions, with outings to 
 Teesside, Northallerton or York for   
 shopping, culture and young-people's  
 sports. Natural beauty and scope for  
{leisure}are adequate compensation.    </content>
