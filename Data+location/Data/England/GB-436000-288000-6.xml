		<content> We did a survey in our school on how  
 many children had telephones.359      
 children were asked and 237 had       
 telephones.We also counted 4 public   
 telephones in 4 squares.These were in 
 Edward Street,Coventry Road,Franklin  
 Road and Poyser Road.                 
 We did a survey on the Postal         
 services.We found out where the post  
 boxes and post offices were in four   
 squares.Strangely enough we found only
 one post office which was at Hill Top.
 There were five pillar boxes.They were
 in Coventry Road,Tulliver             
 Road,Bradestone Road,Caldwell Road and
 Coton Road.There are three collections
 a day.One collection is in the        
 morning,one early afternoon and one   
 late afternoon.We have two classes of 
 post.First class costs 17pence and    
 second class costs 13pence.
