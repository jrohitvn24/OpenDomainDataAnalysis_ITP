		<title>13HISTORICAL WICKWAR</title>
		<content> Historically WICKWAR is derived       
 from the "WICKEN"of the DE LA WARRE   
 family.The EARL of DUCIE is now       
 theLORD of the MANOR. WICKWAR was     
 mentioned in the DOMESDAY book, the   
 first edition of course!              
 The town has not grown as some local  
 towns have.Nowadays there are         
 approximately 1,000+ inhabitants.A    
 recently built new private housing    
 estate of some 50 houses are the first
 private houses built in number for    
 many years.A number of council houses 
 were built in the 1960's.             
 The school numbers have remained about
 the same,between70--80 for many       
 years,while other areas have a drop in
 numbers,often ending in school        
 closure.Recent planning development   
 means that Wickwar is likely to grow  
 as there has been permission given to 
 build on 17.4 acres of land.          </content>
