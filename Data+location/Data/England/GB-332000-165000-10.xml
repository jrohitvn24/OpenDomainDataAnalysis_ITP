		<content> Kewstoke school is a small school     
 and it is set on the side of Worlebury
 Hill.  There are about 90 children in 
 the school and only three classrooms, 
 two in the main building which is old 
 and made of stone.  There is a hut    
 used by the older juniors.  In the    
 main building between the two         
 classrooms is the middle room which is
 used for assembly, singing, dinners   
 and watching television.  Behind the  
 hut is the school's woodland and most 
 of the pupils do projects on it.  The 
 school has a Computer and a video and 
 they are useful to the school.  There 
 are two playgrounds - a grassy one and
 a hard one.  There are a lot of clubs 
 at the school such as Book club,      
 Recorder, Guitar, Art club, soft      
 Tennis, Volley ball, Hockey and       
 Football.
