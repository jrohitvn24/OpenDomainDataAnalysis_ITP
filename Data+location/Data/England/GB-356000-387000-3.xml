		<title>03Sankey Canal and Brook</title>
		<content> Sankey Brook is the main tributary of 
 the River Mersey in the area.In the   
 seventeenth century there were a      
 number of water mills along its course
 which ground flour,and it was also    
 used as a navigation upto Sankey      
 Bridges.                              
 The Sankey Canal replaced this in     
 1757.The canal was raised a total of  
 48 feet by eight locks from Sankey    
 Bridges to Hatdock.It was the work of 
 Henry Berry,and carried coal from the 
 mines at Parr and Haydock via the     
 Mersey to Liverpool.                  
 Today it is used for leisure          
 purposes,such as,fishing and          
 canoeing,as part of the Sankey Valley 
 Park which has other facilities,such  
 as,picnic areas and is used by        
 visiting school parties.
