 and one very modern one,a harvester   
 and a baler.The farmer has seven      
 pasture fields but no arable          
 fields.The farmer finishes work at    
 6.30pm.The vet comes from Wootton     
 Bassett when needed.

 by Captain Barker,who bought it in    
 1964.At Lushill he has 170 cows,2000  
 lambs and 1050 sheep.Five people work 
 at the farm,which has changed very    
 much over the past few years.There

 there are 760 acres.They have planted 
 1000 young deciduous trees.Fifteen    
 hundred gallons of water are used each
 day on the farm.                      </content>
