		<content> The Goldings was a{Georgian Mansion   
 built onto two 16th Century           
 Elizabethan houses.It was bought with 
 its{parkland}by the people of         
 Basingstoke for a{War Memorial}after  
 the{First World War.}Men of both Wars 
 are remembered on a{Monument}which has
 an{Angel of Victory}on top.There is a 
 wall. We think it has 405 bricks on   
 top layer.In the park{children}have   
 their own{play area.}There are        
{swings,roundabouts,slides,sandpits    
 and two{climbing frames.}There are    
{Tennis Courts,}Croquet,Netball.There  
 is a small{Avery}with{buderigars.}The 
{Carnival}and{Fair}is held every year  
 when the industies{advertise}their    
{wares}and collect for{charites.}We can
 hear{music}on the{bandstand.}We found 
 many types of{trees}in the park.      
 In the park we saw two men cutting the
{hedges}around the{Bandstand.          </content>
