		<title>15PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>        Our favourite game in the      
 Playground is BRITISH BULLDOG. To play
 this game one man is 'on' and has to  
 'tig' the others as they try to get   
 across the playgound. When you are    
 'tigged' you are also 'on'.           
                                       
       To play SCARECROW, one man is   
 'on'. When you are caught you stand   
 with your arms outstretched. To be    
 'Released' someone has to run under   
 your arms. If you have been caught    
 three times you are also 'on'.        
                                       
      To play RUSH  you have two teams 
 of four.  One team has to run from the
 top 'den' to the bottom 'den'. If one 
 person gets through the team is safe. 
 If all are caught the teams change    
 places.
