		<title>11HOUSING IN MADELEY</title>
		<content>   In Madeley we have several houses of
importance, mostly listed buildings.   
These include the Old Hall, The Alms-  
houses and the Jacobean House. Besides 
these there is a large selection of old
houses, mainly around the Church and   
along the Holborn. There are now sev-  
eral large estates, which have caused  
the village population to grow consid- 
erably. In 1921, Madeley's first       
council house estate, Knightley, was   
built in the form of a cross. There are
thirty-six houses.                     
  The next estate, Known as the Moss   
Estate, was begun in 1957. Many of the 
houses near the railway line were built
-Cornish style-by the National Coal    
Board for miners coming to this area   
from Durham and Northumberland. There  
are also three modern estates; one of  
bungalows built in 1966,one soon after-
wards, and one set among trees later.  </content>
