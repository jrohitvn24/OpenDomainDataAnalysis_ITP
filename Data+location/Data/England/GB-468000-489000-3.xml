		<title>03Visiting Hutton-le Hole Area</title>
		<content> Many tourists to the area also bring  
 many cars. Parking is allowed on any  
 available space except in Hutton-le-  
 Hole where it is restricted to a small
 area at one end of the village and an 
 excellent car park built by the North 
 Yorks.County Council and designed also
 for picnickers. On good days many of  
 the visitors  sit and picnic on the   
 green or walk round the village       
 and children play in the beck.Other   
 sites near streams in the area are    
 also popular. The large number of     
 public footpaths get only occasional  
 use. Several times in the summer local
 brass bands play on the green.        
 Produce stalls in aid of several      
 charities are organized by villagers. 
 Caravans are restricted.  The village 
 Inn is allowed to take up to 5 vans   
 for not more than 3 nights and rallies
 are held in a near-by field.          </content>
