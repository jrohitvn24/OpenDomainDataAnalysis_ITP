  The Forthampton area is              
 a truly agricultural part of the West 
 Midlands. The area is one of gently   
 undulating land rising from the flood 
 plain of the west bank of the River   
 Severn to a maximum height of 175'.   
 Farming is the only real source of    
 employment today, and the landscape   
 reflects a picture little changed     
 since the original clearing of the    
 woodland hundreds of years ago. There 
 is one main road, the A438, from      
 Tewkesbury to Ledbury, along which    
 lies the hamlet of Long Green. In the 
 centre of the area is the village of  
 Forthampton.                          
 Forthampton village is dominated by   
 the Yorkes of Forthampton Court, the  
 manor house which lies at the extreme 
 east of the village. Life in this     
 block hinges on the Court and farming.</content>
