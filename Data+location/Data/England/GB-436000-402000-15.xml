		<content> I HAVE TWO PONIES CALLED 'CAAN' AND   
 'PEANUTS' AND I KEEP THEM AT          
 ELMHIRST'S FARM IN MOUNT VERNON ROAD. 
 IN THE WINTER THEY ARE KEPT IN A      
 STABLE AND ARE FED ON HAY AND A PONY  
 MIX OF SUGAR BEET AND BRAN. 'PEANUTS' 
 IS GREY WITH A SHORT MANE, LONG TAIL  
 AND BLUE EYES AND HE IS 1O YEARS      
 OLD.'CAAN' IS ONLY 2. HIS MANE IS LONG
 AND SO IS HIS TAIL AND HE HAS BLUE    
 EYES. IN THE SUMMER I WALK THEM ROUND 
 BANK END AND WOMBWELL AND ALTHOUGH I  
 PREFER TO SIT ON A SADDLE I HAVE      
 RIDDEN THEM BAREBACK, BUT I FEEL SAFER
 ON THE SADDLE. I WEAR A HAT, A RIDING 
 JACKET, JODPHURS AND BOOTS. I GROOM   
 THEM REGULARLY AND I HAVE TAKEN       
 'PEANUTS' TO A GYMKHANA WHERE HE CAME 
 3RD, AND AT A SHOW HE CAME 2ND AND HAD
 A CLEAR ROUND.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
