		<content> My house is near the{town centre.}Many
 old houses and shops have been pulled 
 down to make way for{new developments.
 My house is in South Street and was   
 built in{1898.}The houses were built  
 for the{factory workers}of Redditch.  
 Even prior to World War II they were  
 little more than{slums,}and in 1975 it
 was decided to give them a facelift.  
 It was calculated that{demolition and 
{rebuilding}was more expensive than{   
{restoration and extension.}Kitchens   
 and bathrooms were added to each house
 and roof repairs made. When the work  
 was complete the houses were brought  
 to a good standard. At the end of the 
 street, one of the large houses has   
 become a{College of Tapestry.}Another 
 of the houses is selling for Â£30 000. 
 The street has also had trees planted 
 and is now attractive to live in.
