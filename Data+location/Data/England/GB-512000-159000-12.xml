		<title>12POLYAPES CAMP SITE,OXSHOTT</title>
		<content> This permanent camping site is very   
 close to civilisation, yet when you   
 are there it feels like the depths of 
 the country.                          
 Two or three{scout groups}come every  
 weekend in spring, summer and autumn, 
 each group camping independently of   
 the others. One end of the site is    
 used by scouts, and the other by cubs.
 One of the two central fields has a   
 flagpole, behind which there is a     
 scout memorial statue, for all Oxshott
 scouts lost in the 1st and 2nd world  
 wars.                                 
 There are two long wooden chalet type 
 buildings for meetings and games, and 
 also a number of low huts, some with  
 beds, and others which are lavatories.
 The warden and his wife come every    
 week to look after the camp, and to   
 take small subscriptions.
