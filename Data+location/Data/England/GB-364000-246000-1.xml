		<content> The block is a rural area encompassing
 all the village of Bishops Frome -    
 with its church, general stores and   
 post office, hairdresser, two pubs,   
 garage and small industrial estate -  
 and also the outskirts of a smaller   
 community of Fromes Hill. Both        
 communities are in general active,    
 contented and caring people. The      
 mainly agricultural landscape has two 
 hilly areas - at the north Munderfield
 Bank and at the east the ridge from   
 Fromes Hill to Ward Hill. The rest of 
 the area forms a plain through which  
 flows the River Frome. For most of the
 year the river is no more than a      
 stream, but prolonged heavy rain or   
 melting snow in winter can cause      
 extensive flooding.
