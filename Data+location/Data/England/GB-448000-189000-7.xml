		<content> USING INFORMATION COLLATED FROM THE   
 1981 POPULATION CENSUS RE THE 5,489   
 PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS IN DIDCOT AND THE  
 SURROUNDING AREA, THE FOLLOWING       
 FIGURES HAVE EMERGED.OVER HALF(57.3%) 
 THE HOUSEHOLDS ARE OWNER-OCCUPIED,THE 
 REMAINING ONES BEING RENTED FROM      
 VARIOUS SOURCES EITHER FURNISHED OR   
 UNFURNISHED.30% OF HOUSING IS RENTED  
 FROM THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES,1% FROM THE
 HOUSING ASSOCIATION AND A TOTAL OF    
 4.1% FROM PRIVATE LANDLORDS.A LITTLE  
 MORE THAN 3% IS RENTED EITHER BY      
 VIRTUE OF EMPLOYMENT OR BUSINESS.WHEN 
 COMPARED WITH THE FIGURES FOR THE     
 WHOLE OF SOUTH OXON.THESE PERCENTAGES 
 ARE SEEN TO BE  A FAIRLY              
 REPRESENTATIVE SELECTION.THE MOST     
 NOTICEABLE DEVIATION IS THAT DIDCOT   
 HAS AN ABOVE-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COUNCIL
 TENANTS (22.4%).
