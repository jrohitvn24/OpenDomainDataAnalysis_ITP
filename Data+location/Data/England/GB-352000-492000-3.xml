		<title>03Fisher Tarn Reservoir</title>
		<content>{Fisher Tarn }consists of 545,454 cubic
 metres of water which is 120,000,000  
 gallons approx.It does not go through 
 a bacterial process to clean it, but  
 chlorine is added and it is strained. 
   The dam was started in 1897 and     
 the whole reservoir was finished in   
 1934.Only one person works on it with 
 a daily check.                        
   It has overflowed twice since it was
 built.                                
   It supplies 20,000 gallons a week   
 for Paddy Lane and it is not used for 
 Kendal anymore.Soon it will not be    
 used at all and all the water will    
 come from Hawswater and Thirlmere.
