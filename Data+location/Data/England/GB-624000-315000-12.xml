		<content>    We did a random survey in Spixworth
 and Frettenham.We found out that in   
 Spixworth the commonist pet was a cat 
 and the easiest pet to keep was a bird
 and hardest was a dog.In Frettenham a 
 dog seemed to be the most popular pet.
 A rabbit was thought by most people to
 be the easiest pet to keep.One man    
 kept sixty Japaneze Koi Carp for a    
 hobby.He liked them because he said   
 that they relaxed him.The most        
 difficult pet to keep was thought to  
 be a horse or pony.
