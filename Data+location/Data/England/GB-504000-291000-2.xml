		<content>People shop in  the  village  for  food
and groceres, and  news-papers  in  the
village shops.   There are three shops.
The post-office which is also a general
store  and a news-agents, a butcher and
a grocers.                             
To  buy  clothes  and  shoes  and other
things that  we do  not need so  often,
people  go  to  Oundle,   Peterborough,
Kettering, Corby,  Northampton and even
London.                                
Some show  rooms  sell only one sort of
thing, like  electric  cookers or cars.
Some people  use  catalogues instead of
going out to the  shops.  They order by
post.                                  
Some  people  order  by  telephone  for
goods advertised on television.        
Sometimes people  come  to the  door to
sell things.
