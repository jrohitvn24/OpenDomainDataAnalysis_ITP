		<title>13A School Day in Yardley</title>
		<content> On Thursday morning I got up at 7.20  
a.m., got dressed quickly and went     
downstairs for my breakfast - marmalade
on toast which dad had made. I watched 
T.V. for a while and then got ready for
school. On the way to school I bought  
some sweets and then we played Tig     
until the bell went.                   
 It was a mixed day at school. We went 
outside to choose the best in the Bean 
Bag Race for the District Sports and we
had Singing and P.E. but we also had   
the last of our exams - Spellings,     
Tables and Verbal Reasoning. For dinner
we had egg, bacon, chips and beans.    
 When I got home I played football and 
rounders with my friends. After tea I  
went to Football Training with my team 
The Olton Ravens. When I got home I    
watched T.V. until 11.15 p.m. and then 
I went to bed.
