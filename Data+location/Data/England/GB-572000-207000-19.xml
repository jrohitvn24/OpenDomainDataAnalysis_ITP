		<title>19Where can we play?</title>
		<content> Don't do this don't do that is all we 
 see and hear, signs all over the      
 place.                                
  We wrote about our play areas like   
 this.                                 
  Coronation Park has adventure things 
 to go on.I like the swing it goes     
 high.                                 
 A,B,C, park has climbing frames in the
 shapes of letters.I like the A best   
 because you can climb over it.I don't 
 like the C it is dangerous.I play in  
 the field because there is no         
 playground near me.                   
 I have fun at the mushroom but there  
 is a man and a woman called Mr and Mrs
 Grumpy they keep telling us off if we 
 shout.As soon as I sat on a lady's    
 fence I got told off.I was playing    
 football Mr Grumpy said stop.We played
 in the cornfield and a man shouted at 
 us.                                   </content>
