		<content> Woodcraft Industries are the smallest 
 firm at Pivington Mill. They make     
 garden furniture such as sheds and    
 picnic tables and any small wooden    
 constructions designed to customers   
 requirements.                         
  The main type of wood used  is pine  
 from either Sweden or Canada though   
 woods such as cedar and oak are used  
 but are more expensive.               
  Three people are employed here full  
 time and the tools they use are planes
 and bench saws for preparing the wood 
 and an air compressor provides the    
 power for much of the machinery.      
  Todays price for a garden shed 10ft. 
 by 8ft. and made from pine is Â£319    
 inclusive.
