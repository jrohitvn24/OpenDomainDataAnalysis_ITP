		<content> The Forestry Commission from their    
 centre at Tangham, administer the only
 work in this area which could be      
 termed industrial. A staff of 38 is   
 employed, 26 industrials and 12 non-  
 industrials, who belong, voluntarily, 
 to either the T.&amp; G.W.U. or their res-
 pective Civil Service union. The crop 
 of 30,000 tonnes of timber produced   
 annually is mainly Scots and Corsican 
 pine. Hopson Timber Co. of Great      
 Yarmouth &amp; Nelson Potter of Hollesley 
 take about 70% of the sawn-log element
 of production, for use by the const-  
 ruction industry, in shoring timber   
 for mines, and pallets. The remaining 
 small roundwood is exported to Sweden 
 for pulping (which is re-imported for 
 paper making).Waste bark from the saw-
 mills has horticultural and equestrian
 use.
