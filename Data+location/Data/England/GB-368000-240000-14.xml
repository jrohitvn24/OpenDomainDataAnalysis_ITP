		<content> All clubs etc. meet in the{Memorial   
{Hall}which has been{extensively  mod- 
{ernised}over the last ten years with  
 Â£4000 raised by the villagers. New    
 toilets, kitchens amd  committee room 
 have been built on and 6 years ago oil
 fired{central heating}replaced the old
 Tortoise stove.                       
 The{management committee}meets monthly
 and the school teacher does the secre-
 tarial work, and books weddings and   
 other parties of which there were 26  
 last year.                            
{Funding}is handled by the 200 Club.   
 Residents pay Â£1/month, draw 6 prizes 
 and the balance maintains the Hall.   
 In 1981, a{village survey}on "What    
 do you want in the way of activities?"
 resulted in the formation of a        
{Gardeners Club}and the founding of an 
{Annual Flower Show,}and latterly a    
{film club}was started.   Cont.        </content>
