		<content> Forty years ago there were twelve     
 small farms in Scales, and most of the
 inhabitants worked in the village     
 itself. To-day only a few people work 
 on the four remaining farms and the   
 majority travel to the nearby towns   
 of Ulverston and Barrow for work main-
 ly by private car and barns have      
 become homes.
