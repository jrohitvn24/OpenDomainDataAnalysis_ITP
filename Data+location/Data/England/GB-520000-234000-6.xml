  Norton Nurseries are in Letchworth   
 on Norton Road. It is about 70 years  
 old. Carl Keeble runs it on his own   
 but at weekends his brother and his   
 father help. His father also makes    
 the lovely wooden bird-tables and     
 plant containers which they sell.     
  The rarest plant they have got is    
 the miniature water lily; the most    
 common is the lobelia. They have      
 approximatately 500 different types   
 of plants for sale. The tallest plant 
 is the pine which grows to about 13   
 metres. You walk round the nurseries  
 on gravel paths. There are several    
 wooden bridges over little streams.   
  The large greenhouse is also         
 landscaped with a stream running      
 through and pretty rustic bridges.
