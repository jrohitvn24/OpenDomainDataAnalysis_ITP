		<title>03Grafham Water</title>
		<content> To the west of Buckden, Diddington    
 Brook and valley is now the site of a 
 reservoir called Grafham Water.The    
 reservoir,which supplies fifty million
 gallons of water a day to             
 Beds.Bucks.Herts.Northants.and        
 Cambs. draws it's water from the      
 Great Ouse near Offord. The water is  
 pumped through a sixteen foot diameter
 concrete lined tunnel to the furthest 
 end of the resevoir.                  
 The dam wall has a minimum thickness  
 of eight feet. When full the reservoir
 contains 1300 million gallons of water
 covering two and a half square miles  
 with a depth of 70 feet.It was        
 opened in July 1966 by H.R.H the Duke 
 of Edinburgh.                         
  A number of farms and houses were    
 lost due to its construction, evidence
 of which can be seen when the water   
 level is low.                         </content>
