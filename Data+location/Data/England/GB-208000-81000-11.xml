		<title>11A TYPICAL SUNDAY</title>
		<content> We have surveyed 270 children in our  
 school.We asked these questions       
 Do you go to church? 65 people do.    
 Do you go out?100 people do.          
 Do you have roast dinners?143 people  
 do.                                   
 Then we asked if they did not do these
  13 People seldom go out              
  15 people seldom have roast dinners  
 We found in talking to people that    
 many people visit relations on a      
 Sunday or go to the beach in summer or
 go for a drive in their cars.They may 
 go to the cliffs or some other beauty 
 spot.Some people enjoy hiking,playing 
 tennis,football or some other game if 
 the weather is fine.Others prefer to  
 relax and watch T.V.                  
 Quite a few children said that their  
 fathers go out to a pub or a club to  
 play darts,snooker or card games on a 
 Sunday evening.                       </content>
