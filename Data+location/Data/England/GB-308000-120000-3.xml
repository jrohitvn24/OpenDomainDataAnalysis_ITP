		<title>03HOLYWELL LAKE</title>
		<content> I live in Holywell Lake village which 
 is a few miles from Langford Budville.
 I love living in a village it is very 
 quiet but sometimes it is noisey with 
 lorries and tractors. There are a lot 
 of animals in the fields, mostly cows 
 and sheep and there are lovely views  
 from all of the houses. There are     
 fourteen houses, twenty-two bungalows,
 fourteen cottages, four council       
 bungalows and houses and one pub. Up  
 the road from the pub there is a house
 which used to be the village school,  
 it's been converted into a lovely     
 house. The children that went there   
 had to go to other schools. Down the  
 road there is a factory and in one    
 part of the factory they mend cars, in
 the other part of the factory they    
 make blinds for houses.
