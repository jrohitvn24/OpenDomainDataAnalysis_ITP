		<title>03Local History Witgar's Story</title>
		<content>    When the Normans invaded England   
 in 1066 the owner of Bures Mill was a 
 man called Witgar. When he heard of   
 the invasion Witgar realised that the 
 Normans would want to take over his   
 mill. He was unwilling to give in     
 without a fight and so he took the    
 querns, which were the stones used to 
 crush the corn, and threw them into   
 the flood gate so that the mill could 
 not be used.                          
    There is no record of what happened
 to Witgar but ever since his day there
 has been a mill on the same site.
