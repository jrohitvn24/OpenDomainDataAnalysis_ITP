		<title>12DRESSING A WELL</title>
		<content> Each year Hope Valley College         
 designs and dresses its own well.     
 There are six stages in dressing a    
 well.  The first is finding a suitable
 design which is often a biblical      
 subject. The second stage is          
 collecting and selecting the clay.    
 For an average well about four        
 dustbins full are needed.  The third  
 stage is puddling the clay.  The clay 
 is put into a large bath and water    
 worked into it, with bare feet.  It   
 has to be exactly the right           
 consistency.  The fourth stage is     
 emptying the clay into boxes shaped   
 for the well.  They should be three   
 quarters full.  The fifth stage is    
 collecting the flowers which will form
 the design.  Most of these come from  
 local gardens.  Finally the picture is
 made from the leaves of the flowers   
 and other plants.                     </content>
