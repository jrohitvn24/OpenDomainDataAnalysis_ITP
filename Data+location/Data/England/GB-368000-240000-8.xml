		<title>08CODDINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> This{hamlet,}clustered round the{13th 
{Century Church}which was built on the 
 site of an earlier Saxon Church of    
 around AD 1148, seems hardly touched  
 by the 20th Century. There were only  
 three houses built in the last 30     
 years.                                
 The{Post Office}closed 15 years ago,  
 the{school}17 years ago, the children 
 being bused to Colwall and Bosbury    
 Primary, and Ledbury Secondary        
 Schools. There is only a visiting     
 District Nurse and the nearest general
 hospitals are at Hereford and         
 Worcester. There is{no gas, no shop   
{and no Public Transport}in the        
 village.                              
 The majority of the residents are     
 elderly and those in employment       
{commute}to Birmingham, Bristol,       
 Cheltenham and Worcester, or work     
 locally in Malvern and Ledbury.       </content>
