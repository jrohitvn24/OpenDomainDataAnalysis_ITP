		<title>02WHAT! NO TRAINS IN OUNDLE!</title>
		<content> Oundle had been served by a railway   
 since 1845, when a branch line was    
 opened from Blisworth to Peterborough.
 The town was fully served by passenger
 and freight trains for a century, with
 an upsurge in traffic during the      
 1939_45 war, when road transport was  
 severely restricted. In 1948 the      
 railways were nationalised, and the   
 line serving Oundle came under the    
 Eastern region of the new British     
 Railways. The railways were in poor   
 condition after the war, and this,    
 coupled with the rise in private car  
 ownership and road haulage, meant that
 railways declined in the 1950's. This 
 line was closed as a result of the    
 Beeching Report in 1963. Passenger    
 traffic stopped in 1964, but Oundle   
 station remained as a railhead for    
 freight from Peterborough. This       
 traffic ceased in 1972.               </content>
