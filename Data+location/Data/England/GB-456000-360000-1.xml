		<content>      The Coronets Jazz Band is for    
 children from 4 to 18 years old. It is
 for children with nothing to do in    
 their spare time. Also it's a chance  
 to go places,to make more friends and 
 to enjoy music.                       
      Our head trainer is called Mr.J. 
 Nicholson. We have seven trainers     
 altogether. The others are in charge  
 of the banner, Majorettes, Drummers,  
 kazoos and flags. There is another    
 trainer called Mr.A.Chambers. He is in
 charge of the reserves.               
      Our uniforms are blue, red and   
 black. We wear black busby hats and   
 they have gold chains on them. The    
 Majorettes wear white busby hats and  
 chains. The plumes are white for the  
 black busbies and the plumes are red  
 for the white busbies.
