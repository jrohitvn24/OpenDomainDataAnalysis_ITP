		<title>16POLICE DOGS</title>
		<content>    We have observed many uses of the  
 country area around Rivington and one 
 especially interesting scene is when  
 the police bring their dogs to be     
 trained.                              
    A simple white transit van parks at
 the roadside.Out jump two dogs,superb 
 labradors,with their handlers.A blue  
 material is held before their noses,  
 possibly the scent of something.Later 
 it could be drugs or human stuffs and 
 smells.Off goes one officer and hides 
 the material some hundred metres away,
 several shrubs and trees clouding the 
 path.The dog is released and without  
 too many swerves finds its way to the 
 hidden treasure.Success!              
    We decided that this had not been  
 too difficult a task for the dogs but 
 that they had already had a lot of    
 basic training.Few of us realised that
 the park could provide this interest. </content>
