		<title>10Vandalism &amp; Graffiti</title>
		<content>In the surrounding area there is a lot 
of Graffiti and vandalism.The graffiti 
appears on bus stop walls,Toilet walls 
and warehouses.Graffitiis done by chalk
,paint and spray paint.Young teenagers 
and even 12 year olds write on the     
walls because they are bored or it     
makes them look big.I don't think      
enough happens to them in the way of   
punishment if they get caught.Quite    
recently the scout hut in Cranbrook    
was set alight and a new one has       
had to be built.In the Cranbrook       
toilets,sinks have been smashed and    
windows have been broken.Also glass    
has been smashed all over the roads.   
Many subjects are covered from abusive 
and rude comments,pop groups,football  
teams,messages,bad language,and a      
variety of drawings.
