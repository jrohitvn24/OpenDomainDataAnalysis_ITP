		<title>16HOW FAZAKERLEY HAS CHANGED</title>
		<content> Fazakerley has changed quite a bit in 
 the last 30 years. A{tramline}used to 
 run down Longmoor Lane where there is 
 now a{dual carriageway.}There were pig
 sties and an apple orchard at what is 
 now the bus terminus. The Haven Road  
 estate was built in about 1963. The{  
{Reo}(now a{bingo}hall) was a cinema   
 showing the latest films. Our school  
 (four modern brick buildings) was a   
 wooden building only. The new         
 Hawksmoor Road estate was built where 
 allotments used to be. A travelling   
 fair used to stay for a while on waste
 ground in Copple House Lane. The new {
{Fazakeley General Hospital}used to be 
 the Aintree Fever Hospital - an       
 isolation unit.{Hartley's Village}on  
 Long Lane was built by the Hartley    
 family who owned the Jam Preserving   
 factory, but has now gone.
