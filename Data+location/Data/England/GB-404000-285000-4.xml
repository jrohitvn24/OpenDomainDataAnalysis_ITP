		<title>04FREE DAILY NEWSPAPER</title>
		<content>Since October 2nd 1984,Birmingham      
households have begun to receive       
Britains first free daily newspaper. We
thought it would be interesting to     
visit the offices of the Daily News.   
The Editor said the main stages of     
making the paper were planning,making  
sure they get enough advertising,      
getting the papers printed,and getting 
them to 300,000 homes.                 
100 people work full time on the paper 
and 3,200 part time.                   
The editor said that no matter how     
popular the paper becomes they will    
never make the public pay for the      
paper.They receive the news by a London
wire service,and letters from the      
community.The 30 reporters that work   
for the Daily News bring news from all 
areas. The Editor said the main job of 
the Daily News is to inform and        
entertain. By M.PEPPIN and P.MESSAM.   </content>
