		<content>Davinder goes about in an electrically 
powered wheel chair which is most      
useful indoors. Pupils in wheelchairs  
agree that more ramps on pavements in  
town and more space in restaurants and 
snack bars would make the town centre  
more enjoyable. Toilet facilities in   
public places need to be improved. When
travelling greater distances Davinder  
uses a specially adapted minibus or    
taxi.                                  
Nassiem particularly enjoys horse      
riding, swimming and knitting. She has 
discovered many ways of helping herself
to do these things better.             
Most pupils enjoy youth club where able
bodied adn disabled young people enjoy 
sport and other activities together.   
Computer games are very popular.       
Duane's ambitions are to have a job,   
car and wife, to enjoy his life and to 
live to a ripe old age.                </content>
