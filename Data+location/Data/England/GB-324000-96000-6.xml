		<content> Many of the older buildings are       
 constructed of local stone.   There   
 are also brick-built and rendered     
 houses and bungalows.    The materials
 used for the roofs are tiles (91),    
 slate (51), thatch (9), corrugated    
 metal (2), asbestos (1) and timber    
 (1).                               {  
{THE PEOPLE.}                          
 There are 353 people living in the    
 dwellings we surveyed, so that is     
 approximately half the population.    
 266 of these are adults, 80 of whom   
 are in full-time employment, 15 are   
 currently unemployed and 102 are      
 retired.   Presumably the remaining 69
 are housewives and mothers.   54 of   
 the adults told us that they had      
 attended Kilmington Primary School as 
 children.   48 of the people          
 interviewed said that they have       
 relatives living in the village now.  </content>
