		<title>10SPARE TIME IN MILVERTON</title>
		<content>      MILVERTON SCHOOL FETE WAS ON     
 SUNDAY, 16TH JUNE. THERE WERE LOTS OF 
 STALLS. THERE WAS A BOTTLE TOP STALL  
 AND A REFRESHMENT STALL. THERE WAS    
 A FANCY DRESS COMPETITION. I THOUGHT  
 ALL THE COSTUMES WERE UNUSUAL. THE    
 GIRL WHO WON THE CUP WAS DRESSED AS A 
 PEDLAR WOMAN. SHE HAD A TRAY FULL     
 OF NECKLACES AND RIBBONS. IT WAS A    
 NICE SUNNY DAY AND QUITE A FEW PEOPLE 
 WENT. ALL THE STALLS WERE COLOURFUL.  
                                       
     ON SATURDAY, 29TH JUNE, I WENT    
 TO THE CHURCH FETE. THERE WERE SOME   
 ANIMALS THERE. I SAW A BIG, BLACK RAT 
 AND TWO GERBILS. AFTER THAT I WENT AND
 BOUGHT A DRINK OF ORANGE SQUASH. THEN 
 THE BROWNIES DID SOME EXCELLENT       
 COUNTRY DANCING. MY SISTER AND HER    
 FRIENDS DEMONSTRATED HIGH JUMPS. SOON 
 I WENT HOME ON MY BIKE. THERE WERE    
 LOTS OF THINGS TO DO AT THE FETE.     </content>
