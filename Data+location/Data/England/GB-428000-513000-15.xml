		<content>  {Darlington Conservationist,} David  
 Green was always keen on the natural  
 world and when he grew up worked in   
 zoos at{Whipsnade and Belle           
{View,Manchester.}                     
   Now home  again in Darlington, he   
 has recently been particularly        
 interested in the{Great Crested Newt  
 which is nearly extinct.              
   He has been searching ponds in      
 County Durham, came to St Teresa's    
 school and with some of the pupils    
 examined the pond at{Tommy Crook's    
{Park.} They saw{frogs, newts and some 
{tadpoles}in the water.  Amongst the   
 tadpoles was one of the{Great Crested 
{Newt.} Now{St Teresa's School}is      
 applying for a grant from the local   
 conservation group to develop and     
 improve the pond.
