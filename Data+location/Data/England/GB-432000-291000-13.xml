		<title>13Shaper of Nuneaton</title>
		<content>  In 1857 a poor Cornishman,{Reginald  
{Stanley,}went to America. 10 years    
 later, after growing and selling      
 potatoes, involvement in Red Indian   
 wars, and gold hunting in Montana, he 
 returned to Nuneaton a rich man and   
 bought his brother-in-law's business  
 in Stockingford. Soon he owned 7      
 brickyards, 2 coalmines, an           
 engineering firm at the bottom of     
{Tuttle Hill}and a toolmakers. Through 
 his{ornamental tiles and bricks,}and  
 his personality, he affected the shape
 and architecture of Nuneaton. A       
 prominent Methodist and teetotaller,  
 he became known as the{'Great Man'}of 
 the town. Today, the mines and works  
 have disappeared, but the large       
 brickworks on{Croft Road}still bear   
 his name and continue to produce those
 materials he became famous for.
