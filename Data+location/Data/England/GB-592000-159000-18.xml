		<title>18RACHELLE'S HOME.</title>
		<content> My house has a toilet, &amp; a bathroom   
 which has a bath, a basin and another 
 toilet. We have three bedrooms where  
 we sleep. My father works shifts in   
 the paper mill. The kitchen is where  
 we keep all our food- in the          
 refrigerator &amp; cupboards. There is a  
 sink with running water &amp; an electric 
 cooker. The washing machine is in     
 there. The sitting room is where we   
 watch television, from the three piece
 suite. We also have a dining table and
 units.There are stairs to go up to the
 bedrooms. When we go to the shops in  
 Sittingbourne we go by car, but there 
 is a bus. Our car has a petrol engine 
 &amp; in June 1985 petrol is Â£2 a         
 gallon.Our car goes about 35 miles on 
 one gallon. We like to do our shopping
 at a shopping centre, but there is one
 shop near my home in Rodmersham. Our  
 house has a garden &amp; I help in it.    </content>
