		<title>02Wellsmead Field,Bletchley</title>
		<content>   Three schools share our playing     
 field,Denbigh Secondary (1964),Romans 
 Field Special (1972) and Wellsmead    
 Middle School (1970).The origin of our
 name was Well's Mead which was a      
 nearby field shown on the 1718 map,it 
 was probably enclosed by Thomas Wells 
 who lived in the seventeenth century. 
 Romans Field takes its name from the  
 Roman pottery found there.The old     
 parish boundary separating Fenny      
 Stratford from Bletchley was a cart   
 track and a hedge which ran through   
 the middle of where our playground is 
 now.You can tell Wellsmead used to be 
 on farmland because of our old field  
 hedges and the derelict farmyard next 
 to Romans Field School.When the school
 opened there were still ridge and     
 furrow marks on the field.These are   
 now gone like the brook that flowed   
 across the school field.              </content>
