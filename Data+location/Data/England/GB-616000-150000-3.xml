		<title>03BISHOPSBOURNE VILLAGE (1)</title>
		<content> Bishopsbourne is a small village in   
 the Nailbourne Valley. It is bounded  
 by Bourne Park on the north and Char- 
 lton Park on the south, both beauti-  
 fully landscaped areas. It is mention-
 ed in the Domesday Book as "Burnes",  
 i.e. situated on the Bourne. The Nail-
 bourne River flows underground, ris-  
 ing above ground intermittently and   
 unpredictably, an event which, accord-
 ing to legend, is an omen of national 
 disaster. The life in the village is  
 still influenced by the Bourne Estate,
 which has been sold only three times  
 since the Norman Conquest. The village
 has an "old world" charm.  The dwell- 
 ings combine cottages of character    
 with terraced houses built for estate 
 workers and a high proportion of these
 still belong to the Bourne Estate and 
 are rented. Near the church are a     
 number of larger properties.          </content>
