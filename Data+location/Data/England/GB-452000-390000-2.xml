		<title>02Local History in Maltby</title>
		<content> Mostly modern in growth Maltby has few
 old buildings.St.Bartholomew's Church 
 has an 11th century tower.Inscriptions
 on houses are dated 1686 and 1710.Most
 old buildings are of local limestone  
 with orange tiles.Street and estate   
 names date some modern zones.The Model
 Village of 1920 borrowed names from   
 ancient landowners-Scarbrough,Morrell.
 Little London dates from the 1940s    
 when munition workers arrived from    
 London,Scotch Alley from the 1960s and
 the migration of Scottish colliers.   
 Historic names also survive in various
 buildings,Lumley Arms,Rolleston House,
 Maltby Hall School,Manor estate.Thus  
 the past survives in Maltby,a medieval
 stone cross standing in sight of the  
 modern civic centre.The Danish hamlet 
 of Malti's "by" is now dominated by   
 20th century suburbia.
