		<title>07TRANSPORT-TAUNTON TRAFFIC</title>
		<content> The traffic system at the eastern     
 approach to Taunton has seen lots of  
 changes in the last year. Between     
 Wordsworth Drive and The Parade there 
 have appeared 9 new combinations of   
 traffic lights operated by their own  
 mini-computers.                       
 The traffic flow has increased by 30% 
 over the last 10 years even with the  
 building of the motorway and the      
 accident rate was high among cyclists 
 and pedestrians. Despite adverse      
 public comment and press reports      
 surveys show that the flow has        
 improved by 30% and when the lights   
 are centrally controlled by computer  
 this wil be better by another 15% The 
 planners say that in the next 50 years
   there will be a further increase of 
 50% meaning new road systems,possibly 
 traffic free centres and out of town  
 shopping in large hypermarkets.       </content>
