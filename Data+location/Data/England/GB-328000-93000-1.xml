		<content> This block is situated in the south   
 eastern part of Devon, close to the   
 border with Dorset.                   
    It is sparsely populated with few  
 amenities. Most of the area is devoted
 to Dairy Farming with a significant   
 amount of forestry.                   
    The only public transport is a bus 
 service which goes through the eastern
 part. Local people are almost entirely
 dependant on private means of         
 transport.                            
    There are storng historical        
 connections with incidents during the 
 civil war. Much earlier there was     
 great activity during the Roman       
 occupation and before that the early  
 Britons had a fortified settlement.   
     A very beautiful, unspoiled area, 
 it is attractive to tourist who enjoy 
 the pleasures of the unspoilt         
 countryside.                          </content>
