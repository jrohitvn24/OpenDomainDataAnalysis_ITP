		<title>10CAMPING-BOATING WEST OF BATH</title>
		<content> The Caravan Park, which can be seen   
 from the cycle track, can cater for 57
 caravans, with an overflow field for  
 15 more. Alot of the campers are      
 English but many are foreign visitors 
 coming to see{the beautiful city of   
{Bath.}The park does not get many      
 visitors between October and March,   
 the low season for camping in Great   
 Britain.                              
 The Boating Station is also visible   
 from the cycle track. It is situated  
 almost opposite the caravan park. Most
 of the large boats are privately      
 owned, but you can hire dinghys and   
 rowing boats. There is a small cafe   
 nearby.                               
 There are plans to improve this area. 
 The boating station is going to be    
 extended and a picnic area is going to
 be provided alongside the exsisting   
 play park.                            </content>
