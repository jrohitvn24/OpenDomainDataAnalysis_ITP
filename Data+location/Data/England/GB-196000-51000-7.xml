		<title>07St. Mewan Parish Church</title>
		<content> St. Mewan Church is situated just over
 a mile from St. Austell and just a few
 miles from the coast. The Church dates
 back to Norman times. The foundations 
 of the bell tower and the base of the 
 font were built in 1100. The stained  
 glass windows are Victorian and each  
 one shows an incident in Jesus' life. 
 There are many societies and clubs    
 associated with the Church including: 
 Youth Club, Girl Guides, Women's      
 Institute, Creche &amp; The Sunday School.
 Many local people are also connected  
 with the Church through bell ringing  
 and by singing in the choir.          
 In the past 25 years, four vicars have
 lived and worked in St. Mewan. In 1982
 a new vicarage was built just across  
 the road from the church.             
 Each Sunday 60 people from the local  
 community attend the services at St.  
 Mewan Church.            (Avis Martin)</content>
