		<title>17TEST WAY</title>
		<content> The Test Way came into existence on   
 the route of the now- dismantled      
 railway-line which ran from           
 Southampton to Andover and was known  
 as the "Sprat and Winkle" line, and   
 was itself built on the route of the  
 18c Redbridge to Andover canal.  In   
 1984, H.C.C. designated the length    
 from Stoneymarsh near Michelmersh, to 
 Fullerton near Andover, a public      
 bridle-way.  This right of way offers 
 views of outstanding beauty, with the 
 river to the East and the Downs to the
 West, and an abundance of wild flowers
 is replacing the gravel of the railway
 bed.  The bridleway forms part of the 
 longer Test Way which travels from    
 Totton in the south to Inkpen,        
 Berkshire in the North.
