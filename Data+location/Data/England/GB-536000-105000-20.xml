		<title>20CARNIVAL IN WOODINGDEAN 1985</title>
		<content> The carnival takes place every year   
 and stops on the backfield of         
 Woodingdean First School.There are    
 about 70 stalls including             
 games,competitions and stalls that you
 can buy things from.The Mayor of      
 Brighton attends every year and helps 
 judge the competitions.Two bands play 
 for the carnival.They were T.S Valiant
 and the Sussex Legionaires.Different  
 games are played.For example see how  
 many pegs you can get on one hand,beat
 the goalie and make the fireman wet.In
 the first one you have to see how many
 pegs you can get on one hand.The next 
 one you have to kick a football past  
 the goalie.Finally if you hit a target
 a bucket of water falls on to the     
 fireman.Afterwards there is an        
 underwater disco in the swimming pool.
