		<title>14ILFORD PARK POLISH HOME.</title>
		<content> In 1947 the Polish Resettlement Act   
 was launched for the Polish fighters  
 and their families and relatives. In  
 the war the site was an American      
 hospital.There were alot of Polish    
 pilots that fought for England. After 
 the war was over the fighters couldn't
 go back to Poland so the British set  
 up Polish homes like{Ilford Park.}Some
 of the Polish people came indirectly  
 from Poland, travelling first to      
 Africa or Italy, refugees from their  
 own country. Last Friday we went to   
 Ilford Park. Now it is like a home for
 old people but they still speak       
 Polish. We went into one old lady's   
 room, it was not very big and she     
 didn't have very many belongings.     
 There are special baths for disabled  
 people, one of the baths had a door on
 it. In the blocks were little kitchens
 so if they didn't like what was to eat</content>
