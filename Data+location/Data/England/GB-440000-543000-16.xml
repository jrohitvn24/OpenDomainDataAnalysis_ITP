		<title>16A day in the life H Milburn</title>
		<content> I got up and it was a sunny day so I  
 put some sunny clothes on. I went     
 downstairs and had my breakfast of    
 cornflakes. At 8.45 am I went ot      
 school and I put the litter bins out. 
 Then the bell rang at 9 am so I went  
 in my line then went into the         
 classroom. Mrs Rowell, my teacher,    
 marked the register then I went in for
 assembly and sang a hymn. I did some  
 Peak Maths and went outside to play.  
 After play I did my English then it   
 was a dinner at 12. After dinner I    
 went out to play till 1.30. I did some
 art, I painted or coloured a picture. 
 My last playtime was at 2.40. My      
 teacher read me a story then I went on
 a nature walk. Time to go home at 4.  
 When I got home I got my bike out and 
 played on that till 7.30 then I went  
 in and watched the television, then I 
 went to bed.                          </content>
