 When we interviewed Sergeant Golding  
 he said that the main problem in the  
 Dursley area is vandelism. The chief  
 crime is theft, followed by burglary. 
 He is called out to all serious and   
 fatal accidents. His other duties     
 include Road Safety, teaching cycling 
 proficiency in schools, visiting      
 libraries, play groups and pensioners.
 He has to visit prisoners too. When he
 was a Police Constable he had to      
 attend the law court twice a month.   
 Police men work in shifts, 10 p.m. to 
 6 a.m., 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.  
 to 2 p.m. Unless they are on          
 nightshift policemen are not usually  
 called out at night; though they had  
 to do night duties during the recent  
 miners' strike. He said he enjoys most
 of his work.                          </content>
