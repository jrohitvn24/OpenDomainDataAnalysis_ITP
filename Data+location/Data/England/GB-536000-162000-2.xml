   ST MARY'S CHURCH was built in 1080  
 making it about 905 years old.The     
 village originates from Saxon Times   
 and after the building of the church, 
 the village grew up to be as big as it
 is today.The oldest house is Addington
 House.It was built in the 1500's.The  
 village was built around the house    
 which was then inhabited by serfs.The 
 original part is still preserved but  
 there are many additions.The third    
 palace,which still exists today was   
 built in 1770.An Archbishop of        
 Canterbury bought the palace to live  
 in.After the 6th Archbishop the palace
 was sold to a rich diamond merchant.He
 added many parts to the building.In   
 1954 the royal school of church music 
 moved in and still use the palace     
 today.
