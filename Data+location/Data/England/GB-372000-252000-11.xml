		<title>11THE OLD RAILWAY</title>
		<content>  In the north of our block is a       
 dis-mantled railway line. It was      
 closed in September 1964.The last     
 train to run on the line was an       
 excursion to Blackpool.Mrs. Miflin,   
 who is the dinner-time superintendent 
 a Suckley School, rode on the foot-   
 plate of the last train,between       
 Suckley and Bromyard.The engine was a 
 Class 22, double headed 2060 steam    
 locomotive ,pulling five carriages.   
  The line had been opened on the      
 1st.March 1878. It was later extended 
 to Bromyard and then to Leominster.   
 The line was closed due to reduced    
 traffic and the increasing costs of   
 maintenance.The closure was one of    
 many ordered by Dr.Beeching, the then 
 Minister of Transport.                
  The rails have been taken up. The    
 viaduct is still standing and the way 
 is overgrown with weeds and saplings. </content>
