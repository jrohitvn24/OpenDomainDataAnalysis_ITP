		<title>11The Country Park</title>
		<content>    The{Country Park}which surrounds   
{Holme Pierrepont Watersports Centre}is
 a very important amenity for local    
 people. Except during times when a    
 competition is being held, admission  
 is free. There is a large area where  
 people can walk and picnic. Special   
 small artificial lakes are used for   
 fishing and are kept well-stocked with
 many different fish.                  
    A variety of wild-life lives in the
 Park which makes a walk there a very  
 interesting and enjoyable experience. 
 There is also a good collection of    
 wild flowers and trees through which  
 to walk.                              
    Recently a{Caravan and Camping Park
 has been opened near to the Centre. It
 covers an area of 18 acres. A road    
 winds through it so that 300 caravans 
 can be parked in their own little     
 areas among trees and shrubs.         </content>
