		<title>11Breakfast in Elton</title>
		<content> First a bowl of sugarpuffs with milk  
 poured on top.A mug of instant coffee 
 with boiled milk.I put two slices of  
 bread in the electric toaster,two     
 minutes later it pops out crispy and  
 hot,then I butter it.Every other day  
 our milkman leaves four pint bottles  
 on our doorstep.My Mum bought all the 
 food in the Rainbow Co-op in Orton.Dad
 and I go with mum in the car.         
      When there is plenty of time we  
 enjoy a big cooked breakfast.My       
 favourite is eggy-bread and bacon.Mum 
 dips slices of bread in beaten egg and
 fries them in oil in the frying-pan on
 the electric cooker.Slices of bacon   
 are grilled and put on the top and we 
 usually add tomato sauce for a spicy  
 taste.                                
       My Dad likes a plateful of bacon
 fried eggs, sausages and cooked       
 tomatoes.                             </content>
