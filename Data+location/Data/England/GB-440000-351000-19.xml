		<title>19A clothing factory-Riddings</title>
		<content> The Peek-a-Boo factory  makes         
 childrens clothes. We went down to see
 them made. First they design the      
 clothes.  They look at catalogues and 
 sometimes they make up their own      
 designs. The design is then printed on
 paper. Then they choose the best      
 material for the garment. One of each 
 design  is made. They take the        
 garments to show to the shops. The    
 shops then order the clothes they     
 want. The material is laid on a       
 table,a pattern is laid on top of it  
 and the material is cut out.  It is   
 made very  quickly. Each person       
 does a different part of the          
 garment.They are examined and checked 
 because they might not be sewn right  
 and there might be a stitch loose.    
 Then the garments are put on coat     
 hangers and sent to the warehouse.
