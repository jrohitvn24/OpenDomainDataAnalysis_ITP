		<title>07HORSE RIDING IN MICKLEY</title>
		<content> In Mickley there are about 30 horses  
 and ponies mainly kept for leisure    
 riding. Average cost of keeping your  
 own horse is Â£4 per week upwards on   
 local farmers' fields. Most of the    
 horses are wintered out and must also 
 be given hay to eat during winter     
 months which costs up to Â£2 per bale. 
 This is supplemented with feeds of    
 oats,barley,sugarbeet pulp,horse mix. 
 Most owners of the horses are young   
 girls age 8 years upwards.            
 Horses are ridden regularly during the
 Summer months using local bridal paths
 and fields. During Winter horses are  
 usually left in the fields to rest and
 only ridden during good weather.      
 Most of the owners enter their horses 
 in the annual Gymkhana.
