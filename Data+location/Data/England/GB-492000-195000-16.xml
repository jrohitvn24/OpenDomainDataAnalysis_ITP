		<title>16PHEASANT HATCHERY.</title>
		<content> First wild phesants are caught, and   
 have some feathers on one wing cut    
 so they cant fly away.They live in    
 enclosures surrounded by an electric  
 fence to keep away the foxes, and are 
 fed high protein food. There are 5    
 females to 1 cock pheasant. The eggs  
 are put into an incubator holding 7000
 eggs, which turns them all the time   
 for 3 weeks. Then they are put into   
 the still air incubator till they     
 hatch. The chicks are put into an     
 'electric hen' which is warm, and they
 can go underneath it. When they are 2 
 weeks old plastic bits are put on     
 their beaks; this allows them to eat, 
 but they cant attack and kill each    
 other.                                
 When they are 3 weeks old they are re-
 leased into the wild in the pheasant  
 shoots. It costs Â£12 per bird to      
 shoot.                                </content>
