Within living memory, and as far back  
as the mid-nineteenth century Hadleigh 
had a very poor reputation for being a 
rough town.                            
However, more recently the town has    
seen an influx of Ipswich commuters    
and small, high-grade industries,and   
the residents are now keen to improve  
the town's image and exploit its       
tourist potential.                     
The area along the R.Brett has been    
turned into a pleasant walk, as has the
old railway line to Raydon. The area   
around Constitution Hill has been made 
a nature reserve.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
