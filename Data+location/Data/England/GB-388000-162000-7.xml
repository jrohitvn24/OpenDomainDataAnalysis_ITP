		<title>07LOCAL HISTORY OF MELKSHAM</title>
		<content>   In 1816 while digging for coal on   
 the outskirts of Melksham, a mineral  
 water spring was discovered.  They    
 gave up coal mining and started       
 Melksham Spa Company.  A well was sunk
 and a pump room with cubicles for     
 baths built.  People who came to bathe
 stayed in 6 large semi-detatched sp   
 houses.  Unfortunately few people came
 to Melksham ans Bath was more popular 
 and the spa closed in 1822.           
   The spa houses are still used.  They
 are 4 storeys high and have tiled     
 fireplaces in some rooms.  Third floor
 rooms have wrought iron balconies.    
 The original porches are also wrought 
 iron.  Higher in the house rooms get  
 less fancy.  There are plaster        
 decorations on the landings and room  
 ceilings.  The pump room is now a semi
 detatched bungalow but the 14 metre   
 deep well is still there.             </content>
