		<title>14Health Centre: Pateley</title>
		<content>  The Health Centre has four doctors to
 cover an area from Middlesmoor to the 
 Skipton border, across to Sawley and  
 down to Darley. The centre also       
 employs one nurse, a district nurse   
 and assistant, a health visitor and   
 assistant, two social workers, one    
 speech therapist, one chiropodist, one
 physiotherapist and two receptionists.
 Surgeries are held every morning and  
 evening during the week.              
  On Thursday afternoons, there is a   
 clinic for babies where they can be   
 weighed and checked for development.  
 For unwell babies, there is always a  
 doctor on duty. The health visitor    
 gives injections to young people for  
 diseases such as tetanus, diphtherea, 
 measles, polio and whooping cough. She
 also checks babies' hearing. She often
 comes to our school to check our      
 hearing, eyes, and sometimes hair!    </content>
