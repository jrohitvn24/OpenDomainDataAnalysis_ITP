		<title>02Employment and Housing</title>
		<content> There are 4 main areas of employment. 
 Aviation, shoes, building and agri-   
 culture. Most people work away from   
 the village. Because of poor and      
 infrequent public transport, many     
 families run two cars. A high pro-    
 portion of wives have to work to      
 augment the income. This is mainly    
 part time employment. Half the housing
 is over 100 years old, half under 10. 
 Blue lias and reconstitued stone are  
 the main materials. Thatching has     
 often been replaced by Roman pantiles.
 The population is about 950. All the  
 properties, mainly detached, have     
 garden space, and pets are popular,   
 and include racing pigeons, ferrets   
 and sheep.
