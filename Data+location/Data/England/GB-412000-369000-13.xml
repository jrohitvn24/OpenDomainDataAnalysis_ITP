		<title>13Sponsored Walk</title>
		<content>   During July 1985,22 people went on a
 sponsored walk to raise money for the 
 Institute.We left there at 11am and   
 went along Wheal Lane,which at one    
 time was the main road to Bakewell.We 
 turned towards White Lodge,and then   
 across the A6 into Monsal Dale.At     
 Monsal Head we stopped for lunch and  
 here 3 walkers including a four year  
 old dropped out.We then followed the  
 river to Litton Mill.A number of ill  
 treated apprentices from there were   
 buried in Taddington churchyard since 
 Ellis Needham had built an apprentice 
 house(since pulled down) across the   
 river in Priestcliffe.At Miller's Dale
 we turned up into Long Lane which was 
 the road to Tideswell before the      
 Turnpike was built,and then through   
 the village back to the Institute.The 
 walk was ten miles,but I didn't feel  
 tired.We raised about Â£200.           </content>
