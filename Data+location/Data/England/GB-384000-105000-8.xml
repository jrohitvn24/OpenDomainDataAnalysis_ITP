		<title>08Travellers' Rest Farm</title>
		<content>   A{1500 acre farm}rented from the    
 Crown, mainly cereals with sheep for  
 meat. Wheat yields 3.5 tonnes/acre &amp;  
 barley 2.5 tonnes/acre. The land is   
 chalk, of variable quality. Fertiliser
 is needed to maintain output.         
    Farmer is a manager; he employs 5 &amp;
 has 2 sons working as well.{Machinery 
{used:}Grain drier(Â£30000), 8 Tractors 
 (Â£18000 each),2 Combines(Â£28000 each &amp;
 traded after 4 yrs),Fork lift(Â£20000).
   Estimated value of the land is Â£800/
 Â£900 an acre.The benefit of{the CAP}is
 difficult to assess; 1984 harvest gave
 10% less in money than 1983.Farming is
 a business; information is sought from
{Prestel Farmlink;}weather forecasting 
 is much improved;the{NFU}was of value.
   Relations with{the School}were good 
 though pupils were apt to be casual   
 about the land.The farmer felt there  
 could be more contact educationally.  </content>
