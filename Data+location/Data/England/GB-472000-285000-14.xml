		<content> To judge Harborough from an active    
 pensioner's point of view we          
 interviewed Peggy.She lives on the    
 Southern Estate and has been in       
 Harborough for 5 years.She moved here 
 to be nearer her son and daughter-in- 
 law.She enjoys living here but worries
 that there is not enough for younger  
 people to do that is not too          
 expensive.For her own age group she   
 would like more dances but feels that 
 otherwise there is plenty to do.As    
 for facilities on the Southern Estate 
 she feels that it is in need of a     
 Chemist's shop and Post Office and    
 that there should be improvements in  
 the bus timetabling.Peggy enjoys      
 playing Whist.She has played at Stuart
 Rd.O.A.P.Club,Little Bowden Whist Club
 Great Bowden,Harborough Conservative  
 and the Trades and Labour Whist clubs.
 In the Winter she has bridge lessons. </content>
