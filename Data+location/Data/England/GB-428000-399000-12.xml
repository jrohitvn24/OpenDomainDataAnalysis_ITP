		<content> Below the school above the village of 
 Crane Moor we have a recreation       
 field.People in the village have been 
 restoring it now for four years.We now
 have seats, a tennis court, picnic    
 tables and a football pitch. We use it
 for our school games as well as the   
 rest of the village. It used to be    
 covered with brambles and hawthorns   
 but we had some diggers in and had a  
 big bonfire. Then the tractors        
 rotivated it and spread seed. A       
 tractor comes from Penistone to cut it
 every fortnight. Workmen have put up a
 fence to stop the ball going onto the 
 road. We will soon have some swings   
 and a climbing frame from the money   
 from the Gala they have here.
