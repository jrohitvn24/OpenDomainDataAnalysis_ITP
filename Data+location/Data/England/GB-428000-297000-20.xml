		<content>Despite the coming of the railway,the  
town continued as a semi-rural area,   
with little change occurring until the 
First World War.Yards remained crowded,
but the situation was eased when slum  
clearance took place in 1930'&amp; 1950's. 
Council houses were provided,followed  
by private.Even in 1938 there was some 
considerable concern that youngsters   
had to travel to local towns for       
employment This has been partly solved 
by the estabishment of a by-pass which 
encouraged a  greater awareness in Ath.
as part of a road transport network and
consequently two industrial estates    
have been built(CARLYON RD &amp; INNAGE    
PARK)dealing with a very wide range of 
factories eg metal,cardboard,textiles, 
chemical storage,container transport,  
sportsware,textiles,abrasives,footware.
