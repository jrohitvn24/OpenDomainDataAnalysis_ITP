 village hall .The doctors come to it  
 on two mornings a week between 9 and  
 11.30 a.m and people go to see them   
 there .The nearest full-time {Health  
{Centre}is at Chulmleigh ,seven miles  
 away and there are four {doctors}who  
 work from there .We have a District   
 Nurse who visits people in their homes
 ,a {Health visitor}who does the same ,
 and a Nurse who comes regularly to    
 school to test our sight and hearing  
 .If we have to go to {hospital}we go  
 to Exeter , seventeen miles away      
 .That is also the nearest {accident   
{department.}That is where operations  
 are carried out and where our mothers 
 go to have their babies.
