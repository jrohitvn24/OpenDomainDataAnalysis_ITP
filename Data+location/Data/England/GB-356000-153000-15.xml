		<title>15TRANSPORT: WORK &amp; RECREATION</title>
		<content>    At least one car is owned by most  
 families in Britain today. Our class  
 of thirty children conducted a survey 
 and found that every family           
 represented in the class owned one car
 or more, twelve families owned two    
 cars, one family owned three cars and 
 two families owned four cars.         
    Although the car is the most common
 form of transport many other forms are
 also used. Local buses are used       
 regularly, particularly by            
 non-drivers. Many business people use 
 trains and planes for longer journeys.
 Motor bikes are used by many people   
 though only one parent in our survey  
 owned one.                            
    For recreation, all the children in
 our class have push bikes and nearly  
 half of all the parents join their    
 children for cycling trips.
