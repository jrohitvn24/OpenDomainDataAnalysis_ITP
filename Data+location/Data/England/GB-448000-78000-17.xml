		<content>  "Roud is the most beautiful place on 
 the Island"quoted one inhabitant of   
 the Roud area of our survey.          
  Although one or two people were not  
 too co-operative the general response 
 was good.                             
  Only one young lady in Chale thought 
 the proposed issue of a {motocross}   
 would improve the town.               
  No-one thought the bus service was up
 to scratch (although the survey was   
 taken before the Bus schedules were   
 altered-a new survey on this may be   
 neccesary).                           
  Very few people in Roud had moved in 
 recent years and even less were       
 contemplating moving.                 
  Chale,however was different,probably 
 because of the new housing Estate.
