		<content> Geologically, the area is composed of 
 Silurian slates and grits, giving rise
 to thin, acid soils on the whole.     
 However, the effects of glaciation are
 frequently to be seen, mainly in the  
 form of moraine deposits smoothing the
 craggy outlines of much of the        
 countryside. Close to the lake, at    
 Millerground, Queen Adelaide's Hill is
 a particularly large glacial deposit  
 of drumlin shape. The lake itself lies
 in an over-deepened glacial trough,   
 shelving steeply along most of its    
 shoreline towards a deepest point of  
 about 62m.                            
 The glacial deposits have made a lot  
 of difference to soil depth and       
 fertility, where they occur.          
 Drainage is mainly towards the east,  
 via the small river Gowen, which rises
 on the slopes of Sour Howes and flows 
 in to the river Kent at Staveley.     </content>
