		<content>My name is Melanie Knight and I live in
Back Road. I have a little brother     
called Matthew who is just starting    
school - he is three years younger than
me. I have a cat called Cinders. My dad
is a transport manager in Norwich. We  
used to live in Claxton. Both my       
Grannies and Grandads live in          
Wenhaston. Grandad Knight built the    
Village Hall and the garage. He likes  
bowling. Grandad Stammers works at a   
frozen food factory in Lowestoft.      
I read a lot, especially Enid Blyton,  
but I like other books as well.        
We had a holiday in Yorkshire and I    
made a scrap book about it. We camped  
in a tent, but we got flooded out and  
had to sleep in a caravanette.         
I am a Brownie, I go horse riding and  
to gymn club.                          
In school I like swimming and poetry   
best, but I like the other things too. </content>
