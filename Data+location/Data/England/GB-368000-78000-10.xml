		<title>10Living in a Hotel.</title>
		<content>  A hotel is the place where people    
 stay when they go on holiday.I live in
 a hotel.When you live in a hotel,you  
 can't get up until breakfast is       
 finished.You are not allowed into the 
 kitchen from 5.30 to 7.30 during      
 dinner.                               
  We can't get out together very       
 much,but every Sunday afternoon as    
 soon as my mum and dad have finished  
 all of their jobs,we go out for about 
 4 hours until 8.00.You do not have    
 much space in a hotel for your        
 belongings and you can't go up to     
 where the visitors stay.Also we don't 
 have a lounge or dining room of our   
 own.You can't make much noise when    
 there are visitors staying,but my mum 
 says I make enough noise anyway.I used
 to live in normal house,but I wouldn't
 like to go back in spite of all these 
 drawbacks.      Amanda Bayley         </content>
