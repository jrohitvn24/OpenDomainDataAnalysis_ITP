		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN FRILSHAM</title>
		<content> There is no long term{unemployment    
 here. In Frilsham some still work on  
 the farms as their fathers did but    
 with widespread mechanisation the     
 number needed has dropped. One man can
 milk 120 cows with machinery. Where   
 ten men were once employed there are  
 now two. Some men are now             
{self-employed}as electricians or      
 builders. Many{travel}8 miles to      
 Newbury or 10 to Reading to work. The 
 local lime quarry employs two men.    
 There is work for gardeners at big    
 houses and at Brockhurst School. The  
 Yattendon estate employs the largest  
 number of locals. There is now a      
 thriving{Christmas tree industry}from 
 the conifers grown for this purpose   
 in the woods. Women are employed here 
 and in a light{industrial unit}at     
 Yattendon. They work in the large     
 houses or as home helps for the aged. </content>
