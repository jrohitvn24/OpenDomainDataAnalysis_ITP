		<title>15PLANT TECHNOLOGY CENTRE</title>
		<content>  Until 1983 there was a Nursery on    
 the Hale-Woodgreen border selling     
 plants and trees to the public.       
  The Nursery was then sold and in its 
 place there is now a Plant Technology 
 Centre.                               
  The research work carried out there  
 (tissue culture, hydroponics,         
 genetics, etc.)is mainly concerned    
 with trees.                           
  One of their main objectives is to   
 grow certain trees in areas where they
 would not otherwise grow.             
  In countries where deforestation has 
 taken place on a large scale the firm 
 is enlisted by the Government to plant
 large areas of trees, such as teak and
 mahogany.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
