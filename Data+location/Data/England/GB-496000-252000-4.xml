		<content> To run a village shop and post office 
 in 1985 one must be a robust and      
 imaginative optimist.There is much    
 physical work like cleaning and       
 lifting goods.Thought and research is 
 required into the customers'likely    
 needs and in the battle to survive    
 against the multiples'ability to buy  
 and sell at lower prices.The shop     
 sells mainly foodstuffs but other     
 useful items such as toiletries, paper
 goods and sewing needs can be         
 purchased.Professionalism in          
 merchandising, financial control and  
 public relations is a "must".The shop 
 is a social centre and a welcoming    
 smile must always be ready.The shop   
 serves the village people well.The    
 post office is within the shop.
