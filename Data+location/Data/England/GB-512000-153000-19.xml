		<title>19Bookham's Future Trends</title>
		<content> Bookham has changed dramatically since
 1885, from a rural village to a       
 suburban area of 11000 people. Further
 new housing must be very limited by   
 lack of land so change may be in other
 ways.                                 
                                       
 One trend is the type of industrial-  
 isation opposite the station. An      
 engineering works, developed around a 
 former hotel, closed &amp; the coaches    
 bringing in workers ceased. It has    
 been redeveloped as an Industrial Park
 _32500 sq.ft of fully fitted high-tech
 office &amp; industrial units are to let. 
 Many units are still empty after 3 yrs
                                       
 Another trend is an increase in garden
 centres. Nurseries used to thrive on  
 the loam soils but they disappeared   
 under houses in the 50's &amp; 60's. Now  
 the demand for plants has returned.   </content>
