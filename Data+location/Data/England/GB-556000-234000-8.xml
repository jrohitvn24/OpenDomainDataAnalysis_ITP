		<title>08Infants Outing from Wimbish</title>
		<content> On July 2nd all the infant children in
 classes 2 and 3 went on their school  
 outing to Hayes Hill Farm, Lee Valley 
 Park, near Nazeing in Essex. The      
 children particularly enjoyed looking 
 at the donkeys, goats and bulls. They 
 could pick up the baby rabbits and    
 stroke them, and there was a baby lamb
 which was only a few days old. The    
 children enjoyed touching the sheep   
 because of their woolly coats, and the
 pigs because of their sheer size. The 
 picnic in the field was fun and the   
 children made friends with Indian     
 children from a London school sitting 
 next to us in the field. The children 
 were fascinated by the milking of the 
 cows and the processes the milk went  
 through. The highlight of one boy's   
 day was seeing an artist painting in  
 the field as we returned home on the  
 coach.                                </content>
