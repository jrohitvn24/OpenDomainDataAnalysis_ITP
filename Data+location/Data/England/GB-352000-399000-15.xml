 chemical poisoning and the depth of   
 the quarry the Council has decided to

 Village roads a route up the side of  
 the quarry is being built. Each night 
 after the tiiping has been finished   
 nine inches of soil are placed on top 
 of the rubbish so that it doesn't     
 pollute the village. It is expected to
 take twenty years t complete the infil
 The original owner,Edlestone,left a   
 fund which can be used for landscaping</content>
