		<title>15Fenland Drainage</title>
		<content>   The fens used to be a series of very
 shallow lakes, rivers wandered down to
 the sea. Whittlesey was a clay island 
 joined by causeways to other islands. 
   Whittlesey mere was the biggest lake
 in southern England and was over most 
 of the survey area.                   
   The romans attempted to drain some  
 of the higher ground to the north of  
 Whittlesey. They straightened some of 
 the river Nene. Then king Offa built a
 dyke to cross south of Whittlesey to  
 Ramsey. This is Kings Dyke. Mortons   
 leam was built by Bishop Morton. Then 
 in the 17th and 18th centuries dutch  
 engineers came and set up the system  
 of dykes and drains you see today. The
 water is pumped into rivers and then  
 pumped into the sea by electric pumps.
   The peat has shrunk as it dried out 
 and is now much lower than the river  
 level you can see this at Holme fen.  </content>
