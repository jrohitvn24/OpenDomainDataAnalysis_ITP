		<content>   The village would unite together to 
celebrate national occassions. The     
schoo held a party for the Royal       
Wedding and a Service of Thanksgiving  
wa held when the village school was    
reprevied from closure.The approach and
food not quite like that of the past   
celebrations when boiled ham and       
tongue  sandwiches would be organised  
and the children would enjoy a ride on 
swing boats and hobby horses.          
   Today the school is the focal point 
for Christmas and Easter Celebrations  
and the Community Centre the main      
meeting place for entertainment.The    
annual carnival and crowning of the    
Cente Queen take place in July. During 
the year she will represent the village
in other local events.This year all the
children in the retinue attend the     
local school and Rebecca Slinn is      
Queen.                                 </content>
