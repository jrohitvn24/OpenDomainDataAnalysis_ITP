		<content>{BELLERBY FEAST OR CLOWNS' DAY __}The  
 men  get dressed up as clowns in the  
 morning and then they take a basket   
 and money box round the village.People
 put food in the basket and they       
 collect money for sports day.At dinner
 time the children sit around the Cross
 Tree and eat the cakes that have been 
 collected. They are also given        
 lemonade to drink. Usually on the     
 Saturday after Clowns' Day the sports 
 and fancy dress are held in the       
 playing field.                        
{BELLERBY SWORD DANCE__}This took the  
 form of a dance and a play rather like
 a mummers' play and possibly has some 
 connection with Clowns' Day,since some
 of the characters dressed as clowns.  
 It was performed annually until 1872  
 was revived in 1926 and 1981 and was  
 last performed in 1983 at the Richard 
 III celebrations in Middleham.        </content>
