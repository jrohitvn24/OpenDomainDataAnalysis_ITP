		<title>05SHELL COTTAGE  *  HEDGERLEY</title>
		<content>     Shell Cottage is a two story      
cottage under a tiled roof and built in
1679. It was called Shell Cottage      
because it was known to have a shell   
pattern on the roof. The bricks are    
red and blue and like Garden Cottage   
they were made in the Hedgerley Brick  
Kiln. The lower extension was added in 
1799. All the windows have wooden      
frames, above the fireplace there is a 
beautifully carved piece of wood,      
carved in the late 17th century. The   
original staircase and doors are still 
there. In 1901 the owners of Hedgerley 
Manor bought the cottage, they took    
down some of the carving from the      
fireplace, but the top was left incase 
it fell down. Because of the window    
tax in 1799 some of the windows were   
blocked,where this has happened there  
are no blue bricks. The house might    
have been a farm or country house.     </content>
