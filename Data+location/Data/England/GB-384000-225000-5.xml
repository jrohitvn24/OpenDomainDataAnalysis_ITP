		<content>   Today the children go to a junior   
 school in Norton,the next village 4   
 kilometres south along the A.38. The  
 secondary children go to Chuchdown    
 Comprehensive School near Gloucester. 
 The National School has now been      
 converted into a house and we were    
 invited inside by the owner who gave  
 us lots of information about the      
 school and the village. It had about  
 30 pupils and 2 teachers,one for      
 infants,one for juniors.The owners    
 wife went to school in it.            
            {AMENITIES}                
   The only shop closed down 25 years  
 ago so people normally shop in        
 Tewkesbury or Gloucester. The postman 
 comes daily and an ice cream man twice
 a week.There is a postbox and a public
 telephone. The electricity only       
 arrived after the Second World War in 
 the late 1940's.                      </content>
