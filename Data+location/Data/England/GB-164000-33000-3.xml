		<content> Near this house is a very small       
 building which also used to be a      
 chapel a few hundred years ago.       
 Behind this building there is a       
 big rock called{Black Rock}which      
 is a familiar landmark. Not far       
 away there is{Crowan Beacon}which     
 is 800 feet above sea level. The      
 church in{Crowan Village}was first    
 of all built in sections. A church    
 or chapel has existed on the site     
 since the 13th century.  It is the    
 centre point of Crowan Parish.        
 The chapel in Burras hamlet was       
 built in 1923 but the nearby          
 Wesleyan Sunday School dates from     
 1889.  Just across the field there    
 is a{standing stone.} There are many  
 of these stones dotted around the     
 Cornish countryside.  They are        
 believed to be ancient burial sites   
 or places of worship.                 </content>
