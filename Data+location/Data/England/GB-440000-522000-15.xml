 alarm and put my clothes on out of my 
 dressing table.I wake my brother up   
 and have breakfast which is usually   
 cornflakes and a drink of Coca-cola.  
 Then I watch the Saturday Picture Show
 on T.V. showing cartoons and the{life 
{styles}of different celebrities.After 
 this programme my friend Gavin Wild   
 and I play pass and shoot with my new 
 football.I have corned beef and new

 have borrowed from the public library.
 If I get bored or finish the book I   
 play games on my{home computer.}I have
 a nice tea of fish-cake and chips,wash

 at the recreation park until 7p.m.When

 my supper,watch{T.V.}and then go to   
 bed in my own bedroom.                </content>
