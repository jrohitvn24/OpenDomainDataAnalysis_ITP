		<title>17FARMING IN GILMORTON AREA</title>
		<content> This is an account written by a local 
 farmer.                               
 We farm 65 acres of land.We do not    
 grow any arable crops,the land being  
 all down to grass which is permanent  
 pasture,only being ploughed up if worn
 out.The main enterprise is milking for
 which we keep about 50 British Fresian
 cows.We usually rear about 20 beef    
 cattle which are sold as Stores at 18 
 months old.We buy ewes in September/  
 October to utilise surplus grass and  
 tidy up the fields over winter. These 
 are sold with their lambs in April/   
 May. We make hay for winter fodder.   
 This summer we have made big bale     
 silage for the first time. The farm is
 managed by my wife and me with no     
 outside labour being employed. My wife
 keeps a herd of goats as a hobby. We  
 also have a shire horse which we try  
 to work.                              </content>
