		<title>01KENNYTHORPE SAND QUARRY.</title>
		<content>    The Jurassic sand in this quarry   
 is over 140m.years old and was formed 
 from{GRANITE}mountains which were then
 at the Equator.The sand represents the
 different seasonal levels in the bed  
 of an ancient river estuary.It is 97% 
 pure{SILICA}mixed with{CLAY.}There are
 very few fossils because the decaying 
 Granite formed a mild acid which made 
 the bones dissolve.                   
    Sand is extracted by bulldozer and 
 fed,by conveyor,into a drum where it  
 is washed.600gallons are used for     
 each ton of sand.40tons are quarried  
 in an hour.The water,pumped from a    
 lagoon,washes the clay out.It returns 
 to a settling tank so that it can be  
 re-used.The clean,wet sand dries and  
 can be sold as it is,or,more commonly,
 be treated to produce{RESIN-COATED    
{SAND}.
