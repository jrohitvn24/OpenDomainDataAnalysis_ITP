  Over 2 million tourists visit the    
Tower each year, 1 million during the  
high season. Changing of the guard     
takes place at 11.30 each morning, and 
the closing Ceremony of the Keys at    
9.45 each night.                       
  The Governor of the Tower lives on   
Tower Green and there are homes inside 
the outer walls for some 150 people.   
About 37 of them are Yeoman Warders who
live with their families. The others   
are mainly maintenance workers though  
there is a barracks for the Royal      
Fusiliers.                             
  Plans for the future include         
refilling the moat which is currently  
grass and gardens, extending the White 
Tower underground for more exhibition  
rooms and developing the main entrance 
on Tower Hill.
