		<title>11HOME FARM</title>
		<content>      This farm is managed by Mr. A.   
 Jones for The Earl of Halifax.  They  
 keep only sheep and cattle.  The      
 houses are in a courtyard as it used  
 to be a stable and coach house.  All  
 the buildings in the courtyard are    
 used as sheds.  All of the farm is    
 surrounded by grass.  It has a sheep  
 dip in a pen.  There is big Dutch Barn
 where they keep the straw and hay.    
 Two people work on the farm which has 
 three tractors and a few implements.  
 There are two sheep dogs to work with 
 the sheep there is a flock of Jacob   
 sheep. The sheep graze the parkland   
 surrounding Garrowby Hall.  The cattle
 and sheep are sold at York Market.
