    The main store is in Southampton   
 and this is where they decide what    
 items are to to be sold in the other  
 stores. there are over 160 stores in  
 the country.                          
    They advertise on television, in   
 the press and through printed         
 booklets.                             
    They settled on this site because  
 there was no other store like it in   
 the area.
