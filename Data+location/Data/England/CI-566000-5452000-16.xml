		<title>16Rozel Manor</title>
		<content>   Rozel Manor is situated in the heart
 of St. Martin, and has been the home  
 of{the Lempriere family}since the l4th
 century. The Manor house was rebuilt  
 in l77O. The land covers 7OO vergees  
 (3ll acres) including cottages, a     
 farm, a chapel and a colombier.  {In  
{feudal times}the seigneur was         
 lord of the Manor tied by feudal      
 rights and dues to the people who     
 lived on his fief and to the monarch. 
 One of his duties was to ride out into
 the sea on horseback to meet the      
 Monarch.  Today when the Queen visits 
 Jersey she is presented to the        
 Bailiff, Lieutenant Governor and then 
 to the seigneurs of Rozel and Trinity.
 Today the Manor is only of importance 
 to the community as a beautiful       
 building and for charitable events. It
 is not open to the public. Today the  
 seigneur is Brigadier Lempriere Robin.</content>
