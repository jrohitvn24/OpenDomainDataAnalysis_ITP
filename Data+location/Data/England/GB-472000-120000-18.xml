		<content>{ROADS:}The A3 London to Portsmouth    
 road crosses the area from the deep   
 cutting between Butser Hill and       
 Wardown to the town of Petersfield.   
 Its dual carriageway becomes single   
 carriageway at the base of Butser     
 Hill. This occurs at the end of a fast
 stretch of road and has been the      
 location of a number of serious       
 accidents.  Morning commuters         
 travelling towards Petersfield usually
 meet a 'tail back' stretching from    
 Maple Durham crossroads to the town.  
 The problem is caused by the high     
 number of vehicles and the            
 miniroundabout and pedestrian         
 crossing in Petersfield.  The         
 pedestrian crossing is almost         
 continuously in operation from 0830 to
 0900 hours due to schoolchildren and  
 shoppers crossing the A3.  Quite minor
 accidents can produce similar hold ups</content>
