		<title>05Local Disaster_Summit Tunnel</title>
		<content> It was Thursday 20th December 1984 at 
 about 6.30am when a fully loaded      
 petroleum tanker was{derailed}in the  
 first trans_Pennine tunnel_the Summit 
 Tunnel.All the emergency services were
 called to help and a centre was set up
 at Fothergill and Harvey's.There was a
 great danger of a massive explosion-  
 luckily the trucks just burned.Flames 
 shot about 150ft from the air shafts  
 and the sky was covered in black      
 smoke.Also petroleum from the trucks  
 outside the tunnel leaked into the    
 River Roach adding further danger.    
 These trucks had been brought out by  
 the brave driver and fireman.         
       They put out the fire eventually
 by pumping foam down the ventilation  
 shafts,and even then it took four days
 to end the emergency.
