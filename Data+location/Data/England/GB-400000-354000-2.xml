		<title>02BRADNOP'S RAILWAY.</title>
		<content> The Cauldon Low to Leekbrook railway  
was opened on June 15th 1905 by the    
first train from Leek at 8.05am.       
 There were once regular passenger     
trains from Leek station to            
Waterhouses.The train used to slow down
outside Thors cave so people could see 
it properly.                           
 Now the railway track is used only for
Cauldon Low quarrys purpose carrying   
stone through Leek and on through Endon
towards Stoke.                         
The track runs alongside the main A523 
all the way through the Bradnop area.  
 Bradnop station is now is now almost  
disappeared now through deriliction,   
there is only a small piece of platform
left now.It is opposite what is now a  
coal store.It was burnt down in 1928   
but was rebuilt again.                 
 Local people get used to the noise    
after a while.                         </content>
