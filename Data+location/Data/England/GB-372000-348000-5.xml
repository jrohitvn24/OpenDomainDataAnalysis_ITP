most historic building in this area.   
It was built in 1185 AD and it is      
celebrating it's 700th centenery this  
year although the present building was 
built in the 16th century.Rev.John     
Whitehead is the present vicar but he  
has only recently taken over from Rev. 
Henry Armstrong who has now retired.   
The church has a choir of its own who  
perform at weddings,funerals etc.The   
actual building is timber framed with  
lead and tiled roofs. Along either     
side of the nave are 8 octagonal       
pillars made of Spanish Chestnut.      
There is a graveyard around the church 
with an extension across the road.     
There is said to be a ghost in the     
church but there are no recorded       
sightings.There is a clock on the Bell 
Tower in memory of Charles Fletcher    
Twemlow.It was installed in 1967.      </content>
