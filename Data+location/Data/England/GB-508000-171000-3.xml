		<title>03ST. DUNSTANS CHURCH</title>
		<content> St. Dunstans Church was the first     
 symbol of Feltham and it was an       
 Anglo-Saxon Church. It was built over 
 900 years ago and was built before the
 Normans invaded in 1066.St. Dunstans  
 was probably named after Dunstan,the  
 Bishop of London but before that it   
 was dedicated to St. Dunstan.         
 The old St. Dunstans Church consisted 
 of a tower,nave and chancel and in had
 an isle. The tower which had a wooden 
 spire was almost completely covered in
 ivy.                                  
 The demolition of the old church was  
 completed in 1801 and all that was    
 left was the south side wall          
 foundations which were used to help   
 build the new church.A lot of the old 
 material was used again in the new    
 church and an original chest of       
 drawers can still be seen.
