		<content> The average family living in Cornish  
 Hall End in 1985 consists of a        
 married couple with 2.2 children.The  
 majority of homes are of older people 
 although there is a steady increase in
 young families moving into the        
 village.                              
 Most houses are brick built with older
 ones of lathe &amp; plaster with roofs of 
 slate tiles and thatch, the newest    
 house being built in 1982.            
 There are council houses,tied cottages
 and the remainder privately owned.    
 Mains water, electricity and sewers go
 into most homes although some have    
 wells and cess pits and outside       
 toilets. 9 out of 10 families keep    
 pets such as a dog,cat and rabbit.    
 Most husbands go out of the village to
 work while their wives stay at home   
 some doing a part-time job.
