		<title>15Reading Habits in Fremington</title>
		<content>   Here are the results of a small     
 survey we did on the children at      
 our school to find out about what they
 thought of books and reading in       
 general.                              
   Most of the children like reading.  
 They usually read for between 2 and 5 
 hours a week.  Most liked fiction     
 books. Some peopie have comics and    
 magasines regularly. Most peopie      
 read two books a week. Most peopie    
 read more at home than at school. Some
 people prefered hard backs to         
 paperbacks but most didnt mind.       
 A lot of children read in the         
 evenings. Lots of peopie bought the   
 books that they read but some borrowed
 all their books from the libary.      
 Nobody read The Bible!
