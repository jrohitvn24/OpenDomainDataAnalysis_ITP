Chorley Walking Day. (A)               
Walking day in Chorley always takes    
place on the first Saturday in June.It 
is a time when the majority of the     
Chorley churches walk in a long        
procession through the centre of       
Chorley.They all start walking from    
their own church.                      
The procession is called a "Procession 
of Witness" and this is because the    
people taking part are witnessing that 
they are members of the Christian      
Religion having accepted Jesus Christ, 
the Son of God, as their own personal  
Saviour and Lord.                      
The procession is always led by        
St.Lawrence's Church of England as they
are the oldest Church in Chorley built 
in the 1200's and is more usually known
as 'The Parish Church'.
