		<content>    The village of Necton had its      
 original roots in Mill Street,where   
 the mill was situated and the remains 
 still are,and Church Street.  Apart   
 from the buildings in these two main  
 streets random housing,often made of  
 "clay lump" with reed roofs, straddled
 lanes leading to and from the village.
 Building radiated out from here, the  
 greatest development coming after the 
 second World War when council housing 
 was erected along the Hale Road and to
 the North in Ketts Hill.              
    Over the past 20 years mainly small
 developments and self built houses    
 have sprung up consisting in the main 
 of bungalows interspersed by a few    
 houses and chalet bungalows.          
    The village is one of five which   
 has been designated as a development  
 area over the next 10 years therefore 
 new housing will continue to be built.</content>
