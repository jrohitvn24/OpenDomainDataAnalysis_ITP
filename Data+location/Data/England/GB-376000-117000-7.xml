		<title>07A family weekend in Marnhull</title>
		<content>  SATURDAY is very much a family       
 shopping day often at a nearby        
 town.Dad helps mum with the purchases 
 in the supermarket.Some dads work on  
 Saturday. As many mothers work,       
 Saturday is the only day they can     
 shop.Few men in this area visit a     
 place of organised sport,but some     
 watch it on TV in the afternoon.Much  
 TV is watched at night especially     
 films,mostly American.                
  SUNDAY.Very few go to any place of   
 worship.Most get up later than usual. 
 Mother cooks the dinner while dad does
 odd jobs.Children watch TV or a video,
 or play with friends.All return for a 
 cooked midday meal.Any visiting of    
 relatives is done in the afternoon.   
 Some visit the sea in the summer.Women
 who work often do their washing and   
 housework on Sunday.Most watch TV or  
 video in the evening.                 </content>
