		<title>11THE ELDERLY POPULATION</title>
		<content> EASTBOURNE IS WELL KNOWN FOR THE      
 NUMBER OF ELDERLY PEOPLE LIVING IN THE
 TOWN.APPROXIMATELY ONE IN THREE OF THE
 RESIDENTS IS OVER THE AGE OF          
 RETIREMENT.THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT     
 BECAUSE IT IS REFLECTED IN THE        
 SERVICES OF THE TOWN.EVERYTHING MIGHT 
 SEEM TO BE DIRECTED TO THE ELDERLY.   
 HEALTH SERVICES SEEM TO BE WEIGHTED   
 TOWARDS THE OVER 60'S THOUGH THERE    
 MIGHT BE ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR THE  
 YOUTH OF THE TOWN.ONE EFFECT OF THE   
 IMBALANCE CAN BE SEEN IN THE LIBRARIES
 WHERE THE BOOKS ARE IN MY OPINION MORE
 SUITED TO THE OLDER PERSON WITH       
 RELATIVELY FEWER FOR THE YOUNGER      
 PERSON.APART FROM THE LARGE DEPARTMENT
 STORES,CLOTHES SHOPS TEND TO CATER FOR
 THE OLDER PERSON.YOU DO NOT GET MANY  
 BOUTIQUE STYLE SHOPS HERE.            
                                       
                                       </content>
