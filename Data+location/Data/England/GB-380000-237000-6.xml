		<content> Stanks Lodge is situated across a     
 large field at the end of Stanks Lane.
 It was formerly a gamekeeper's        
 thatched cottage and was renovated and
 re-roofed with tiles in the 1960s.  It
 is occupied by an elderly couple, who 
 formerly ran pigs in part of their    
 garden.                               
                                       
 The garden is intensively cultivated  
 and very productive.  In July there   
 were carrots, onions, spinach, runner 
 beans, broadbeans, courgettes, leeks, 
 tomatoes, parsnips and cabbages.      
 There were also fruit trees (plums,   
 apples, pears, and damsons) and soft  
 fruit.  The quantity of produce far   
 exceeded the needs of the couple, and 
 the wife took the surplus to the local
 W.I. Market, where high quality fresh 
 produce is always in demand.
