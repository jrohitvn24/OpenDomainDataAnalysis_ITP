		<content>  {Reading beds:}which predominate in  
 the central and northern area covering
 some 40% of the total study area.     
 These were laid down some 55 million  
 years ago in the so called Eocene     
 period. They consist of sand and      
 mottle red and white clay. Towards    
 Dorchester the sand is fairly coarse  
 and contains some flint gravel.       
  {Alluvium:}in the Frome Valley which 
 covers some 35% of the area in the    
 southern and central parts. This was  
 laid down in comparatively recent     
 times.                                
  {Chalk:}covers some 15% of the area  
 and is confined to the western end.   
 This was laid down some 65 to 100     
 million years ago.                    
  {Gravels:}cover some 10% of the area 
 in 4 main patches.These were laid down
 in Palealithic times.
