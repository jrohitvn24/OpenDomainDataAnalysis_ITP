		<title>19CHAPELS IN TYDD ST.GILES.</title>
		<content>    There is one Noncomformist church  
 in the village.It belongs to the      
 Methodist movement,and was built in   
 1885.Several other Methodist chapels  
 were built around our area at about   
 the same time,so the Methodist church 
 must have had a strong effect on the  
 people then.Only one of those other   
 chapels is still in use.The village   
 chapel now has a service every Sunday,
 with about 20 people attending.The    
 building is used by the village play  
 group during the week.In the 18th     
 century the Baptist Church began to   
 meet in the village.The congregation  
 was started by John Smith,the village 
 shopkeeper.People were baptised in a  
 pond,near the chapel,on Broadgate.More
 people went to the Baptist Chapel than
 to the parish church.The chapel was   
 sold in 1922 and is now used as a     
 barn.                                 </content>
