		<title>01THE  MAYOR</title>
		<content>  The Mayor is a very important person 
 in the Borough.  He has his own house,
 and he has a Parlour in the Civic     
 Centre.  He wears a black             
 three-cornered hat, a red jacket with 
 gold edgings, black trousers and a    
 gold chain of office around his neck. 
 The Mayor's chauffeur lives in Iris   
 Avenue near my school.  The Mayor has 
 many cars and one of them is a        
 six-seater Ford Granada with back     
 seats facing each other.  The         
 Mayor's Secretary deals with all the  
 dates for him to visit places.  He    
 also arranges annual events such as   
 opening special things like homes for 
 the dis-abled, new roads and housing  
 estates.  There is a new mayor every  
 year elected from the Councillors. The
 Mayor sometimes visits our school.
