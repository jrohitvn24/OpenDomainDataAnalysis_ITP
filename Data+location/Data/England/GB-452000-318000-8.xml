		<title>08UNEMPLOYMENT IN LOUGHBOROUGH</title>
		<content> In Loughborough in May 1985 there were
 3609 people unemployed and only 252   
 job vacancies left. In May 1984 there 
 were 3492 people unemployed and only  
 141 job vacancies left.In May 1983    
 there were 3589 people unemployed and 
 only 193 job vacancies left.We can't  
 see any sign of Loughborough's        
 unemployment problem getting any      
 easier because neither the number     
 of vacancies nor the number of        
 jobs has changed very much in the     
 last three years.The main factories in
 Loughborough are the Brush which makes
 electrical machines, generators and   
 switchgear;Towles,Mansfield and       
 Marthon which make knitwear and       
 clothes.There's Rikers and Fisons     
 which make chemicals and drugs and    
 Herbert Morris which makes cranes.
