		<title>14The Wendover Commuter</title>
		<content>People choose to live or retire in     
Wendover because of its picturesque    
setting, selective education system    
or rail service to London and          
Aylesbury, the main centres of         
employment. Local work is found in     
shops, offices and the Halton RAF Camp.
 Hurry! Hurry! I'll be late.           
My neighbour's at his garden gate      
"Where's my suitcase? Where's my hat?" 
"Get out of the way, you stupid cat!"  
He slams the door with a clatter of    
feet,                                  
His neighbour's half way down the      
street.                                
Running fast down Dobbins Lane, he gets
a stitch - Oh what a pain!             
Then from the station a screeching     
sound - as wheels start sparking off   
the ground,                            
And as the train gets under way,       
A Wendover businessman starts his day. </content>
