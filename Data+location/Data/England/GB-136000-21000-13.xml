		<content>{A Rocket Life-saving Apparatus is used
 to rescue people from shipwrecks close
 to shore. The following is an account 
 of a RSLA practice at Gwennap Head.   
 "Shooom! The rocket zooms through the 
 air pulling out a thin rope from the  
 cannister as it goes. Being small it  
 does not go dead on target, but has   
 to be aimed to allow for the wind. As 
 it goes over the top of the 'ship' the
 rope lands across the decks, then they
 pull across a thicker rope, fix it    
 firmly and tie it to a tripod on the  
 cliff. There, two poles support the   
 tripod. Then a breeches buoy is put on
 the rope. This is a sort of bag which 
 people stick their legs through and   
 sit in with a lifebelt around them.   
 They bring the people in from the ship
 one at a time. About a dozen people   
 are needed to pull the breeches buoy  
 to and fro."{SEE ALSO 'NANJIZEL' ENTRY</content>
