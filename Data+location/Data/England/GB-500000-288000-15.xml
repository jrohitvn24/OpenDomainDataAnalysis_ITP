		<title>15Farming in the Block</title>
		<content>This block is largely agricultural, and
a very successful one too. The farms   
are mainly arable. The crops grown are 
things that do not need a lot of water 
as the whole area drains into the      
River Nene.   They include wheat,      
barley and beans.   Many farmers grow  
sugarbeet, because of the nearby sugar 
processing factory at Peterborough.    
A newly introduced crop is oil seed    
rape which is very profitable.         
The farms are highly mechanised and the
farmers employ only one or two workers 
at the most.                           
The fields nowadays are very large and 
the old field hedges have been grubbed 
up to make the large fields.           
One local farmer has sheep and another 
has dairy cows.   Most farms have beef 
cattle they fatten during the summer.
