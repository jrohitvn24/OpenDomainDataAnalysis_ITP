		<title>13HOPE  END ANDREWS VIEW.</title>
		<content> I live on a smallholding at Hope      
 End.We don't have a shop,church or    
 pub,so my mum goes to Bishops         
 Stortford for most of her shopping.My 
 dad is'nt just a farmer,he helps fly  
 aeroplanes.We have 100 chickens,ducks 
 and geese whose eggs we sell.Mum      
 collects the eggs   two or three times
 a day or they get smashed.My dog helps
 to keep the fox away.We have four     
 cows.We sell their calves at market.We
 grow potatoes,onions,tomatoes,runner  
 and broad beans.We also grow soft     
 fruit,and have cherry,pear,plum and   
 apple trees.We sell most of the fruit 
 at the market.As it is so open,it is  
 wet and windy in winter and it is     
 difficult to feed the animals but we  
 like living at Hope End because it is 
 quiet and pretty.
