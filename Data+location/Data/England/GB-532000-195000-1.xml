{                                      
 About 1500 people are employed within 
 the centre, which was built on the    
 site of the old education offices.    
                                       
 Many playschemes &amp; holiday clubs are  
 organised by the Parks Dept. and run  
 throughout the school holidays. The   
 playschemes are open to all children  
 without charge and provide a range of 
 sports, recreation, arts &amp; crafts     
 activities organised &amp; supervised by  
 part-time play leaders. Holiday clubs 
 provide a more formally structured    
 programme of activities for which     
 charges are made. Attendances at these
 schemes throughout the year are       
 expected to exceed 80,000.            </content>
