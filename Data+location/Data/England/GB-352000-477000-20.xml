		<content> TWELVE YEARS AGO HILLSIDE WAS A FIELD 
 CALLED SPRINGFIELD. THE BUILDERS      
 CALLED FOX BROTHERS FROM BLACKPOOL    
 BOUGHT IT.THEY BUILT 26 DETACHED      
 HOUSES IN A CRESCENT-SHAPED           
 CUL-DE-SAC.THEY WERE FIRST SOLD FOR   
 PRICES RANGING FROM Â£10,000 TO        
 Â£13,000.THEY ARE NOW BEING SOLD FOR UP
 TO Â£45,000.ALMOST ALL THE OWNERS HAVE 
 TWO CARS.A TOTAL OF 85 PEOPLE LIVE    
 IN HILLSIDE.THE GARDENS ARE           
 OPEN-PLAN.THEY HAVE LIME SOIL SO      
 PLANTS SUCH AS ROSES THRIVE BUT       
 RHODODENDRONS AND AZALEAS DO NOT      
 BECAUSE THEY LIKE ACID SOIL.GAS IS NOT
 PROVIDED IN HOLME AT THE MOMENT SO    
 PEOPLE HAVE TO USE SOLID FUEL OR OIL  
 FOR HEATING.(GAS PIPES ARE JUST BEING 
 LAID.)TELEPHONE CABLES ARE UNDERGROUND
 WHICH LEADS TO PROBLEMS WHEN IT RAINS.
