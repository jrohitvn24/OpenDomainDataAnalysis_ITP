		<content>   South Norwood is an old town; there 
 is a fountain at the bottom of South  
 Norwood hill which dates back to 1887.
 Some of the houses around South       
 Norwood are derilict and have to be   
 rebuilt. In Suffolk Rd. half of a     
 Methodist church was demolished to    
 make space for old peoples' homes.    
 Opposite the old peoples' homes  are  
 Stanley halls where clubs and plays   
 are held. Joined on to Stanley Halls  
 there is a school called Stanley      
 Technical. In Holmesdale Rd. there is 
 a well known football club called     
 Crystal Palace. There used to be a    
 canel flowing through South Norwood.  
 Because of the canal the pub called   
 the JOLLY SAILOR was built. Most of   
 the lamposts in South Norwood were gas
 but have been converted to            
 electricity. In the High Street there 
 are a lot of coal chutes and cellars, </content>
