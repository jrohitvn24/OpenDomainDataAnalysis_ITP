		<title>01Overview of the Kilby Block</title>
		<content> This block is a typical example of    
 rural south Leicestershire. The       
 majority of the land, some 3/4 is     
 Intensively Managed Grassland used    
 for either grazing or production of   
 winter feed.The block does contain    
 many trees although there are only    
 two small woods the majority are to   
 be found in hedges or isolated in     
 fields. The block contains part of    
 the Midland Railway and the Grand     
 Union Canal in addition to various    
 roads. The remaining 1/4 of the land  
 is dominated by either the village    
 of Kilby or Wistow Hall and grounds.  
 There are also small parts of other   
 villages Fleckney and Newton          
 Harcourt. The population is very      
 small most in Kilby village the       
 rest in isolated farmhouses or        
 the parts of the other villages.
