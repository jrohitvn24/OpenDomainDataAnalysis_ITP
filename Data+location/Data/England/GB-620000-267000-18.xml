		<title>18Worlingworth School Memories</title>
		<content>Over the past 40 years Worlingworth    
school has changed from grit &amp; dirt    
playground to asphalt,outside toilets  
to flush type indoor ones,open fires to
central heating &amp; from an age range of 
5 to 15 years to 5 to 11 years.The     
numbers of pupils &amp; staff have reduced 
considerably.The amount &amp; variety of   
equipment has increased as has the     
range of activities.A swimming pool &amp;  
a micro-computer are now in use.In the 
past most children walked to school,   
1.25 miles was common.Now children     
arrive by car or cycle in good weather.
The golden age of the school may have  
been 12 years ago when we had more     
pupils &amp; a new head improved           
facilities.For the future we would     
expect fewer children &amp; amalgamation   
with other schools.
