 The workforce has been relatively     
 stable - 25% of workers have been in  
 the same job for 15-20 years with only
 1 or 2 employers.20% have changed     
 employers frequently but not jobs.    
 There is evidence that mobility is    
 increasing - 15% have started a new   
 job within the last few months. 80% of
 our respondants claimed a high level  
 of job satisfaction, 10% were fairly  
 happy but would have preferred an     
 alternative career and 10% were       
 dissatisfied. Less than half those who
 were eligible for Trades Union member-
 ship had joined.Those who had, were   
 split evenly into those who recognised
 the benefits of membership and those  
 who worked in negotiated closed shops.
 Surprisingly none of our sample are at
 present unemployed but 40% have       
 experienced being out of work.        </content>
