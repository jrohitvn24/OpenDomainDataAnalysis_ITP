		<title>18Modern Popular Music</title>
		<content>   Modern music is great. It appeals to
 most age groups; children, teenagers, 
 and adults. Quite often my Dad buys a 
 record which is my favorite as well.  
 You can also listen to music on the   
 radio or television. There is a two   
 hour radio program of the top forty   
 hit records on a Sunday evening, and  
 'Top of the Pops' on a Thursday on the
 T.V. Some of the sounds of the        
 eighties are reminiscent of the       
 sixties. Rhythmn and blues, Soul,     
 and Rock and Roll are still alive.    
 There are 'casual' groups such as     
 Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Wham,    
 Nick Kershaw, and Culture Club.       
 Recently there has been a wave of     
 'Gender Bending', where men dress     
 effeminately, (started by The New York
 Dolls), such as Boy George, Divine and
 Marilyn. New digitised music can give 
 us nearly perfect sound reproduction. </content>
