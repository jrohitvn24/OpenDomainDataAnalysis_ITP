		<title>08STOKE DOYLE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Like many villages round here Stoke 
 Doyle has a village school which is   
 now closed because of the decline     
 in population. The school has just    
 been sold and will be converted into a
 private house as has happened in      
 Lowick, Tywell and Sudborough.        
   At one time the school, the pub and 
 the nearby church were the centre of  
 the community. The school was used    
 quite often for activities like       
 keep-fit, the harvest-supper and      
 church fetes which raised money for   
 different parish activities. In the   
 day time the school was of course used
 for teaching the village children of  
 primary age and Sunday School also    
 took place in the building.           
   However, unlike Barnwell,Glapthorn  
 and Polebrook the Stoke Doyle School  
 is no longer considered to be viable.
