		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> In winter time I watch television in  
 the drawing room and Mummy lights a   
 wood fire. Childrens programmes range 
 from cartoons to cowboy and Indian    
 films. I have supper at 7.30pm and    
 then I have a bath and clean my teeth.
 Mummy then reads me a story before we 
 say our prayers and go to sleep.      
 In the holidays I get up much later   
 and I go out into the yard and throw  
 the 16 bantam chickens three          
 scoopfulls of corn. I collect their   
 eggs from the hay boxes and when I    
 have had my breakfast I feed the dogs.
 We have three dogs who live inside the
 house and one outside guard dog. We   
 also feed the three cats. During the  
 day I ride my bike around the garden  
 and the farm track. We have a swimming
 pool and when it is hot we splash     
 around in it a lot!
