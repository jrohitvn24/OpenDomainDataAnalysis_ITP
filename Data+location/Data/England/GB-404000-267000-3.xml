		<title>03Living in Church Hill.</title>
		<content>{Church Hill}has pleasant surroundings.
 There are lots of trees and play areas
 and space to ride bikes. Some houses  
 are posh detached houses which people 
 own. Others are semi-detached or      
 terraced, and are rented from the     
 Council. They are nice but have small 
 gardens. It is not far to drive away  
 from all the houses into the          
 countryside. There are five{schools,}a
 small{shopping centre,}a{health centre
 with four doctors and a special clinic
 for new babies. We have two churches. 
{St. Andrew's}is a new Methodist Centre
 and is built of brick.{St. Leonard's  
 is as old as the Normans. It is built 
 of stone with stained glass windows   
 and is hidden among the trees at the  
 top of a hill. Every July there is a  
{fete}at the old church with lots of   
 stalls to buy from and children from  
 local schools give dancing displays.  </content>
