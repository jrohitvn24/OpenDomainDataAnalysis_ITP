		<content>      WHEN TALKING OF LETTERBOXES ON   
 DARTMOOR WE CONJURE UP A FALSE PICTURE
 OF A RED CAST-IRON BOX, WHERE YOU MAY 
 POST A LETTER. FAR FROM THIS URBAN    
 IDEA, THE FIRST DARTMOOR LETTERBOX WAS
 MERELY A BOTTLE STUCK IN A BANK AT    
 CRANMERE POOL IN 1854. A MODERN       
 LETTERBOX MAY BE AN ICECREAM CONTAINER
 WITH AN INK PAD, A RUBBER STAMP AND A 
 VISITORS BOOK.SOME OF THE STAMPS ARE  
 SHOWN IN ONE OF THE PICTURES FOR THIS 
 AREA.THE AIM OF THE LETTERBOX HUNTER  
 IS TO COLLECT ENOUGH STAMPS TO BECOME 
 A MEMBER OF THE '100 CLUB' BY VISITING
 100 OR MORE BOXES. SOME HUNTERS HAVE  
 THIER OWN STAMPS WITH WHICH TO "SIGN" 
 THE VISITORS BOOK AT THE LETTERBOX.   
 THE STAMPS ARE HIDDEN ALL OVER THE    
 MOOR, CLUES BEING AVAILABLE TO HELP   
 FIND THEM. THERE ARE OVER 750 ON THE  
 MOOR AT ANY TIME.
