		<title>01Starston An arable landscape</title>
		<content> This quiet unsophisticated corner of  
 South Norfolk includes the village of 
 Starston and the outskirts of         
 Harleston, Needham and Pulham St Mary.
 It is flat open farming land criss    
 crossed with country lanes which were 
 once hedged and ditched but are now   
 mostly cultivaed up to te roadside.   
 Throughout the block there is a       
 scattering of small hamlets and       
 isolated farms. The farms are not     
 large, covering between 10 and 200    
 acres. Agriculture is predominantly   
 arble, the main crops being wheat,    
 barley, sugarbeet and oil seed rape.  
 one recent change has been the        
 disappearance of dairy cattle. this is
 due to EEC monetary incentives to     
 discourage the produciton of milk.    
 There remain a few intensive units of 
 pig, poultry and beef cattle.
