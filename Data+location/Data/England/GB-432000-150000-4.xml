		<title>04HATHERDEN HOUSE FARM.</title>
		<content>  The Capes  family have lived at      
 Hatherden House for over forty years  
 and they farm 1,250 acres.Two thirds  
 of this is cereal crop, 300 acres are 
 grass and the rest is given over to   
 dairy cows and peas.There are 6 people
 who work for them altogether three of 
 these are tractor drivers.They start  
 work at 8am and they stop work at 12pm
 for dinner then they go back to work  
 at 1pm and go on till 5pm.They work 5 
 days a week.They have 6 Ford tractors 
 and 1 David Brown tractor and they    
 have 2 combines which are yellow  and 
 1  baler which is red.They have 180   
 dairy cows and young stock and 16     
 horses,some which are used by riding  
 for the disabled.Mr.and Mrs Capes     
 don't want Andover to spread this far 
 and they want more time to meet people
 in the villages and they hope no oil  
 is found as a result of the survey.   </content>
