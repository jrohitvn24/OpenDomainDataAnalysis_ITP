		<title>08Eartham Quarry</title>
		<content> In Eartham Quarry they dig out        
 many different sizes of gravel. To do 
 this they use a scoop,which holds     
 between 3 and 5 tons of earth and then
 load it into a 36 ton truck.          
 There is a weighbridge at the quarry  
 for public as well as their own       
 personal use. Trucks come to collect  
 stone from there for roadmaking,and   
 they also deliver things which Amey   
 Roadstone (who quarry the land)mix    
 with their own stone. When they wash  
 the stone they get a lot of dirty     
 water. The stuff which is not too bad 
 they recycle, but the really muddy    
 water is pumped into big basins where 
 the moisture evaporates to leave mud  
 which dries back into soil. They then 
 restore this to agricultural land.
