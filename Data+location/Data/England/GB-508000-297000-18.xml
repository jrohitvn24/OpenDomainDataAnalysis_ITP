  The farm is an arable farm which     
 specializes in winter wheat. Since    
 wheat can only be grown for about     
 three years running in the same field,
 break crops of potatoes, sugar beet,  
 peas or grass are grown every fourth  
 year to allow the soil to recover.    
 Crop specialization allows mmore      
 efficient management of the farm.     
                                       
{CONSERVATION                          
{ }The farm has a Site of Special      
 Scientific Interest which contains    
 some rare water plants. Trees have    
 been planted in many places on the    
 farm to screen buildings and improve  
 views. Many trees have been planted on
 the farm boundary adjacent to the A1. 
 There is a watermill on the farm which
 can be seen working and many old farm 
 implements have been preserved.       </content>
