		<title>04LAW AND ORDER IN EPSOM</title>
		<content> In Epsom there are 60 policemen, 9    
 cars, and 11 dogs. At any one time    
 there are 10 men on the beat. Busiest 
 hours  are between 10 PM and 4 AM at  
 weekends. Every week about 18 people  
 are taken in for crimes like drunken  
 driving, assault and theft. Most of   
 the accused are tried at Epsom        
 Magistrates' Court or the Juvenile    
 Court. In the Magistrates' Court 200  
 to 250 cases are heard a week by the  
 38 justices in the 2 court rooms.     
 Cases take 10 minutes with a guilty   
 plea or all day  with a non-guilty    
 plea. The accused are sent to the     
 police station overnight but can't be 
 kept there for more than 3 days. If   
 they are found guilty they can be sent
 to Brixton and if they are under 21   
 they are sent to the Lewis Remand     
 Centre. Cases demanding a jury go to a
 Crown Court such as at Kingston.      </content>
