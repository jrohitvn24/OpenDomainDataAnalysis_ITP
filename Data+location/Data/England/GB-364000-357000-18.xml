		<content>    Approximately 1/3 of the population
 (adults &amp; children) regularly attend a
{church or chapel},but often this does 
 not include all family members. Very  
 few households have no{pets or other  
{domestic animals.}Dogs, cats, rabbits,
 goldfish, hens, ponies &amp; goats are all
 kept. Most housewives choose to make 1
{main shopping trip}to a major store in
 Crewe or Nantwich,travelling by car.  
 These are sometimes augmented by      
 visits to local shops or occasionally 
 by trips to larger shopping centres   
 such as Chester or Manchester. 2/3 of 
 the households take a{holiday}away    
 from home during the year,usually in  
 summer. Of these 1/2 frequently go    
 abroad,with the remainder choosing    
 Great Britain. Types of holiday       
 include caravanning, package tours,   
 and "bed-and-breakfast" accomodation.
