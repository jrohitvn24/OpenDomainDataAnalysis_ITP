 The area is rural with many small     
 villages and lots of farms. The       
 Tillingbourne river runs through the  
 area.  It is  a short river only      
 eleven miles in length.  The A25 bye  
 pass which was built in 1961 also runs
 through the area.  Guildford, the     
 County town of Surrey is six miles to 
 the west, and Dorking a market town is
 six miles to the east.  The area      
 contains much heath and woodland.  It 
 is attractive wooded countryside with 
 the North Downs to the north and      
 Hurtwood to the south.  Both these    
 areas contain many paths and          
 bridleways.  The picturesque villages 
 today tend to be commuter villages.   
 There is only some light industry in  
 the area at Gomshall on the A25. Here 
 there is a tannery and a Target       
 factory which makes archery targets.  </content>
