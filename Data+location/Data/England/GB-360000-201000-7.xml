		<content>    Elizabeth Corney began ballet      
 dancing when she was four and was soon
 winning talent competitions.Later,when
 entry to ballet school eluded her,the 
 love of dancing spurred her to open   
 her own school in Lydney.Twenty six   
 years on her success and popularity   
 has made the School attract not only  
 local children but others from as far 
 away as Swindon and Pontypridd.       
    Her most successful pupil was Julie
 Rose who began ballet at six.At eight 
 she won a scholarship and at eleven   
 successfully auditioned for the Royal 
 Ballet School.Eventually she entered  
 the Company and travels extensively,  
 sometimes taking solo parts.She has   
 been offered an open contract,the     
 first offered to a lady dancer.       
    Boys too attend the classes,one of 
 whom,Andrew Buckley, also gained entry
 to the Royal Ballet School.           </content>
