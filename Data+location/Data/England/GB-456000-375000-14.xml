		<content>     The construction of the road is   
 costing a large amount of money as in 
 addition to the normal costs is the   
 price of roundabouts, undercuttings   
 and footbridges which will allow life 
 for locals to continue more or less as
 normal. There was initial concern from
 people living by the route over noise,
 fumes and the value of property.      
     The initial order was made by the 
 Minister of Transport in 1979 to      
 construct 8.18km (5.09 miles) of      
 highway. To allow work to be done on  
 private roads he needed an order under
 Section 14 of the 1980 Highways Act.  
     Leaflets were sent to people      
 living beside the proposed route to   
 inform them of the new plans. A model 
 was also put on display and drawings  
 and documents were available to the   
 public. The public were also informed 
 of how to voice any objections.       </content>
