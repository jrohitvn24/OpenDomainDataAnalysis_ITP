		<content> 35 acres of grassland are farmed with 
 another 15 outside the area as a small
 mixed livestock farm. This is a family
 hobby farm and does not produce the   
 main source of income. The farm       
 buildings (832059) hold the pigs:1    
 boar, 4 sows and their litters which  
 are all Large Whites and are fattened 
 and sold. They also house 200 hens    
 which are kept for egg production. On 
 the grassland are kept an average of  
 10 young cattle which are fattened and
 sold, and 1 Jacob ram, 30 ewes and    
 their lambs which are sold for meat.  
 Jacob sheep are kept because the      
 farmer likes old fashioned breeds and 
 they produce very sweet meat as well  
 as attractive fleeces for sheepskin   
 rugs,although they are not ready for  
 sale as quickly as modern breeds.
