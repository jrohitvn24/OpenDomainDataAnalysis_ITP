		<content> A DAY AT SCHOOL- A PUPIL              
                                       
  I got up and got dressed. My Mum did 
 my hair. Iwas half way through my     
 breakfast of cornflakes and toast when
 Dad was ready to take us. I was quite 
 excited because the Nursery kids were 
 coming to visit today and my sister   
 was coming. I got to school quite     
 early and played in the playground.   
  When the bell went we went in. It was
 Thursday so we did English. At 10.15  
 the Nursery arrived and my sister was 
 there.  I looked after her at         
 playtime. After play we sang them some
 songs from our concert and I played   
 Londons Burning on the recorder. I can
 play it without looking at the music. 
 Then we had dinner, it was meat, salad
 and chips. In the afternoon I played  
 football with the boys. I got a       
 bruise. Then we went home.            </content>
