		<content>   No time for my own affairs today! A 
quick glance at the morning post over  
breakfast,then off to visit one of the 
Magistrates' Courts in the south of the
County with the Chairman of the        
Magistrates' Courts' Committee.Meet the
Chairman of the Bench and local        
magistrates informally and discuss some
of their problems before sitting in    
Court with them.                       
   Back to Aylesbury to a working lunch
to launch an important charitable      
appeal;then up to the north of the     
County to finalise details of a Royal  
Visit next month.                      
   Finally back home to change into    
uniform to present Lord Lieutenant's   
Cadets with their badges and a Sergeant
Major Instructor with his Certificate, 
after which my wife and I meet the     
cadets' families and their officers    
over a buffet supper in the Drill Hall.</content>
