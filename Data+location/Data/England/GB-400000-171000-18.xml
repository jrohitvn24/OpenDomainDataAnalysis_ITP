		<title>18WALKING IN THE CALNE AREA</title>
		<content> Sometimes my friends and I go walking 
 up the lane. There is a house next to 
 a field and in the field there are    
 some stables and three horses. There  
 are some pipes outside the field and  
 we sometimes sit on them and watch the
 horses jumping over the barrels and   
 fences.Opposite the house is another  
 field with a horse and cows in it.Some
 sheep pass through now and again to   
 get to the next field.The horse is a  
 black stallion, and has to sleep      
 outside the little hut as it is too   
 mucky from the cows.There are holes in
 the hedges for sheep to get through.  
 We watch the rabbits and enjoy the    
 wild flowers.There are lots of        
 elderberry bushes and hawthorns.We go 
 blackberry picking in the autumn and  
 my Dad picks the elderberry flowers   
 and berries for making wine.
