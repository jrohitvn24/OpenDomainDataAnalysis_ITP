		<title>14RIVINGTON COUNTRY PARK</title>
		<content>    The people of Bolton have never    
 lost the large expanse that Lever     
 left. It has been maintained in       
 varying condition since l925 but      
 latterly has been formed into a modern
 country park with the necessary       
 environmental controls.               
    One major problem in the post war  
 era was the damage caused by          
 increasing traffic use of the area,not
 least in the mounds of litter,some of 
 it dumped and the ever widening verges
 gouged out by parked cars.            
    The Country Park has now provided  
 new car parks with toilets and a      
 gradually improved surfacing and      
 landscaping.The public appear to be   
 increasingly won over to the correct  
 use of the areas and this promises    
 well for the continued preservation of
 this favourite rural escape for the   
 folk of Bolton.                       </content>
