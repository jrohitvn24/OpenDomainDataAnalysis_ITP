		<title>06BUTTERLEIGH POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The person who runs the post office in
 Butterleigh has lived there since     
 1966, but the post office did not open
 until 1972.The post is collected only 
 once a day by mail van and then taken 
 first to Cullompton, before going to  
 the main sorting office in Exeter. It 
 is also delivered by mail van - this  
 is because the farms and houses in the
 area are so spread out.               
 Although the post office used to sell 
 more, it is now very small and only   
 sells stamps. On average, fifteen to  
 twenty customers are served per day.
