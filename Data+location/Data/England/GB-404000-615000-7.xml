		<content> Our area is rich in wild life.The most
 common wild animals are the fox,      
 rabbit and hare.  Roe deer, Cheviot   
 goat, badger and the red squirrel are 
 probably the most rewarding wild      
 animals to look out for.              
                                       
 In addition to the very common birds  
 you might also be lucky enough to see 
 a kestrel or a shorteared owl. The    
 curlew and the 'peewit' can be seen   
 and heard over the moorland.          
                                       
 Foxglove, harebell,meadow sweet       
 pineappleweed and common ragwort are  
 some of the flowers that you might see
 in our block of land.                 
                                       
 We have quite a lot of pipistrelle    
 bats in our area. This bat has a 28cm 
 wingspan.
