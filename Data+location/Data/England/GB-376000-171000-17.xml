		<content> The village centre has changed little 
 since about 1750.  It contains a      
 number of fine old buildings, with    
 later development, all set in open    
 rolling countryside.  The High Street,
 with a Market Place at the east end,  
 is the main thoroughfare with parallel
 lanes behind the buildings. Other     
 lanes lead into the country and       
 open fields, grassland and woodland.  
 Outlying farms, barns and boundary    
 walls are all built of local Cotswold 
 stone.  In the village is one Grade I 
 listed building, the 15th century     
 Parish Church, and several Grade II   
 'star', including the Manor, Home Farm
 Barn and its Dovecote, the Almshouses 
 of 1612-1619, nos. 14 and 123 High St,
 Marshfield House (the former Vicarage 
 of 1730) and a chapel, now the Legion 
 Hall.  Most buildings in the High     
 Street are listed Grade II.           </content>
