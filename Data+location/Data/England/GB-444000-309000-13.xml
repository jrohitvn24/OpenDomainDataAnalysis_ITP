		<content> My day starts at quarter to seven in  
 the morning.I get my dressing gown and
 slippers on and go downstairs to do   
 some piano practice till quarter past 
 seven,then I have my breakfast then I 
 go upstairs and wake everyone else    
 up.I then get washed, dressed and I   
 clean my teeth.At twenty to eight My  
 Mum takes my brother and I to school. 
 At nine a.m. a whistle is blown by a  
 teacher in the school playground.     
 We all line up then go into school.   
 When we get into school we find       
 something to do then our teacher takes
 the register.We do either english or  
 maths till half-past ten when it is   
 break. We come back in at five to     
 eleven and swap over work.At twelve   
 o'clock we have lunch and a break.When
 we come in we do topic or sewing we go
 home at half past three.At seven p.m. 
 I go to Guides then I go to bed.      </content>
