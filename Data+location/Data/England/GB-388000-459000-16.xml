		<title>16Housing in Malhamdale</title>
		<content> There are no housing estates as such  
 in Malhamdale,although new houses are 
 being built,especially in Airton.Many 
 new developments tend to be barn      
 conversions.Most houses are owned by  
 their inhabitants,though some farms   
 and farmhouses are leased.            
 In Airton there are 2 "alms" houses   
 for the elderly poor of the dale.
