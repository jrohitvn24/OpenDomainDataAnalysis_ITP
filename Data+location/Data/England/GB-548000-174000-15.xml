		<content> There has been a great deal of damage 
 due to vandalism at Erith Cottage     
 Hospital. Outside the X-Ray room there
 is a lot of graffiti which has not    
 been removed as one of the staff said 
 that it would cost over Â£500, and they
 could put that amount of money to     
 better use. There are no children     
 staying at the hospital, they only go 
 there for stitches, broken arms, blood
 tests etc. If there is an emergency   
 they are sent to West Hill Hospital at
 Dartford.  Ambulances don't normally  
 go to Erith Hospital except to take   
 patients to bigger and better equipped
 hospitals.
