		<content>    Waterbirds come round this area    
 because there are many types of canals
 and reservoirs.                       
    Moorhens and Ducks, mostly Mallard,
 are very common.                      
    Swans are fewer because the water  
 is not very clear and they often die  
 because of fishing tackle left around.
    Geese are quite popular and can be 
 found mainly in reservoirs.           
    Tawny owls are very rarely seen in 
 the day because they are nocturnal.   
 They obtain voles from the water, but 
 they are shy.                         
    Wrens live in hedgerows with ivy.  
 They are very timid.                  
    Kingfishers are seen around here   
 and love the fish in the reservoirs.  
    Swallows fly over canals so fast   
 you could think they would crash!     
    Great Crested Grebes also can be   
 seen in the area.                     </content>
