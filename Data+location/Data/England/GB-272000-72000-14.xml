		<title>14HOME LIFE  DARTMOOR FARM</title>
		<content>      The churchwarden farmed at       
 Elliot's Hill until he handed over to 
 his son.He now lives on the farm in a 
 cottage which he built himself and    
 called New Glebe House.He gave it this
 name because he used stones from the  
 ruins of a thirteenth century priest's
 house on the glebeland which was part 
 of his farm. The stone built open fire
 in his living room has a lintel which 
 came from the fire in the pheasant    
 keeper's house, now also a ruin.In the
 garden is the iron pump and a stone   
 trough marked E.R.P.B.These were both 
 in the kitchen of the old             
 farmhouse.The water from the well is  
 now pumped by electricity.            
     On the farm a barn has been       
 converted into an art studio for Jayne
 Mayhew.She specialises in painting    
 pictures from photos of moorland      
 scenes.She uses oil, water colour,&amp;ink</content>
