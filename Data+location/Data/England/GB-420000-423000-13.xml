		<title>13VANDALS</title>
		<content> Vandals   are   pathetic,  they  smash
 windows,  write on walls and to top it
 all they use stupid words because they
 can't  think  of  any  good and useful
 things  to say. They  spoil  childrens
 education  by smashing  windows  which
 Kirklees  have  to pay  for. With  the
 money the schools  could have at least
 a computer for each form. On the whole
 Kirklees  spend  more on vandals  than
 they do on text books and other things
 which  are  important to a  school. If
 they  wanted  a  good  education  they
 wouldn't  do  it at  all and  if their
 parents knew they'd do something (well
 I know  mine  would). They  should put
 more   posters  up  about  vandals  so
 they'd understand it's wrong. Secondly
 they should have a policeman in nearly
 every   area where  there are mindless
 people.
