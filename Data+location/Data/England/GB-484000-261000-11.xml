		<content>Station Rd.                            
Station Road was once the principal    
route to the South,but the construction
A45 road made it a cul-de-sac.Built on 
this road was the railway station (now 
a Restaurant), the river wharves, and  
one of the three water mills in the    
parish(whose name-White Mill-survives  
in the nearby Garden Centre.)          
The built up section of the road       
contains a small bakery and shop, and  
two grocers.Otherwise the street is    
made up of mixed private and council   
accommodation apart from the premises  
of the largest local employer,Messrs   
Barker. A large traditional shoe       
factory has been extended to its limits
and a controversial new site is being  
developed at the Northern end of       
Station Rd on an area stretching       
through to West St.and Park St.
