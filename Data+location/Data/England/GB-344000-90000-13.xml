		<title>13Bridport Carnival.</title>
		<content>      The Bridport carnival was revived
 in 1971. Apart from a carnival in 1947
 in aid of the Bishop's Appeal Fund    
 there had not been a carnival         
 Procession in the town since the early
 1930s.                                
      Bridport's carnival is held once 
 a year usually on the third Saturday  
 of August. Floats are divided  into   
 three classes:                        
  1. Public Houses of Bridport;        
  2. Firms from Bridport and the       
 surrounding area;                     
  3. Individual floats.                
     The floats assemble at about      
 5.30p.m. in Sea Road and set off      
 at about 7.00p.m. The parade takes    
 about an hour to go round the         
 course. Many people walk the course in
 costume collecting money for local    
 charities.                            
                                       </content>
