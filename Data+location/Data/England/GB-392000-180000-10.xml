		<title>10Cycling in Seagry.</title>
		<content> Everybody in our class has a bike of  
 their own.There are lots of different 
 kinds of bike in our class.They're    
 mostly shopping and BMX's but there   
 are four people who have racers.The   
 colours vary a lot mostly blue.The    
 spokes are mostly metal but some BMX  
 ones have plastic spokes.Every bike   
 has reflectors on their pedals and    
 most of them have them on the back.   
 Lots of the shopping bikes have bells 
 on them.BMX bikes are used for        
 performing stunts and so they have    
 specially strong front forks.Shopping 
 bikes are designed to be more         
 comfortable and have a basket on the  
 front and a saddle bag behind the     
 saddle.Fifty per cent of the parents  
 of children in our class also ride    
 a bicycle at least once a week.We have
 used our bicycles whilst collecting   
 some of the information in the survey.</content>
