 1936-7,but various buildings have been
 added since.It employs 35 staff,-24   
 nurses.They have 2 wards and 4 side   
 wards.The most common cause of        
 accidents are domestic,industrial     
 injuries and traffic accidents.They   
 have a post natal unit.If needs       
 arise a flying squad can come from    
 Plymouth. Major surgery is not        
 done.The elderly can be fetched.The   
 land on which the hospital is built   
 used to be marshland and a pump under 
 the building drains the land all the  
 time.They employ 3 full time cooks and
 all meals are cooked in the hospital  
 at the moment but from September the  
 meals are to be cooked in Plymouth and
