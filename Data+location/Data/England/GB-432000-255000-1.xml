		<title>01The Quarry in Lighthorne:1</title>
		<content> The quarry has existed from the start 
 of this century.The stone they quarry 
 is called oolitic limestone.The stone 
 is sold to local builders for houses, 
 extensions, garden walls, fireplaces, 
 etc.                                  
    The soft surface stone is used for 
 hardcore, mainly in farm driveways,   
 gateways and under farm buildings.The 
 man at the quarry uses only one small 
 excavator to dig out the stone.The    
 walling stone is found in three       
 uniform layers, 127mm, 102mm and 51mm 
 thick.The walling stone is easier to  
 handle in dry weather because it is   
 picked out by hand.                   
    All the new houses in Lighthorne   
 are built with oolitic limestone and a
 lot of the older houses would have    
 been built with local stone too.The   
 quarry is used regularly.
