		<title>09TYNEMOUTH AND THE SEA</title>
		<content> Tynemouth and North Shields have had a
 long association with the sea and all 
 that it involves. Before the two piers
 were built at the entrance to the     
 River Tyne, it was a commom sight to  
 see ships aground on the rocks at the 
 foot of the cliffs, so it was not     
 surprising  to learn that the first   
 lifeboat was invented by an engineer  
 from North Shields - William          
 Wouldhave.                            
 Lifeboats soon became a common sight  
 around the coasts but in certain      
 situations they cannot get close      
 enough to the foot of steep cliffs,   
 and with this in mind the Tynemouth   
 Volunteer Life Brigade was formed,    
 operating from the Watch House on the 
 cliff top. From then Tynemouth became 
 a centre for marine rescue and a brand
 new communications centre has been    
 built in the grounds of the Priory.   </content>
