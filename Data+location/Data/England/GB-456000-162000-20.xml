		<title>20FOLKLORE OF THE TADLEY AREA</title>
		<content> "Tadley,God help us" so known from the
 terrified reaction of a villager when 
 asked by the first hot air balloonist 
 ever seen in the area where he had    
 landed; is famous for its 'treacle    
 mines' so called because when a hole  
 for a well was dug on Tadley Common it
 would fill with a black liquid        
 resembling treacle. This originated   
 from decaying vegetation.             
  Ghosts of the area include a white   
 horse which appears at Halloween on   
 Shalford Bridge at Wasing, while      
 Brimpton boasts a coach and four which
 plunges into the river at Able Bridge 
 on a January night. A witch, Maria    
 Hale (or Hare) rises from her grave in
 Aldermaston churchyard and a tradition
 of placing stones on her grave to     
 prevent this has arisen, but this does
 not seem to work as people still claim
 to see her.                           </content>
