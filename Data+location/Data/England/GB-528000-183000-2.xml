		<title>02Somers Town</title>
		<content> Somers Town is in the North West part 
of London and the flats are quite big  
and most of the flats have a good view 
of the street below them. What I like  
best is the neighbours are very very   
friendly. There is always a friendly   
shopping place near you. Somers Town   
 sed to have a lot of fields and farms 
before the railways. This is what it is
like on my way to school noisy, scary  
and dusty and a bit of a long way from 
the school and it is smokey because of 
the cars and windy sometimes and i see 
pubs. There are nice buildings in      
Somers Town. Somers Town in 1985 is    
modernised because there are lots of   
cars, houses, offices and loads and    
loads of buisy buisness men and women. 
On the street there is lots of rubbish 
although it is cleaned every day. On   
the streets there are dangers like     
cracked paving stones.                 </content>
