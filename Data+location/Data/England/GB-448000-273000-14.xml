		<title>14ST. ANDREW'S MIDDLE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> St. Andrew's was built in 1973 with   
 427 pupils on roll when the school    
 opened.The pupils came from many      
 different backgrounds and included as 
 well as indigenous children,pupils    
 whose parents came from the West      
 Indies,Asia,India,Pakistan,Iran,Greece
 China,Spain,Portugal and Italy.Since  
 the school opened the number of pupils
 has fallen,but it is now beginning to 
 rise again.In September there will be 
 190 pupils in school.                 
 The school is best known for its steel
 band,The Saints,who play in many parts
 of the country and have played in     
 Germany.The steel band was started    
 after a visitor for the Commonwealth  
 Instistute suggested we try a steel   
 band in school in 1975.Originally many
 West Indian children played in the    
 band.Now pupils from many different   
 backgrounds play in it.               </content>
