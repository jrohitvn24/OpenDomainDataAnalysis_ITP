		<content>       We interviewed a lady about     
her life when she was small.           
      She was born in the village,her  
father owned a butchers shop and when  
she left school she helped in the      
shop. There were a lot of shops in the 
village then but now there's only one. 
      People used to go stone picking  
in the fields, the stones were used for
road repairs.  When the first car went 
down the road everyone came to watch.  
It was a major event! Few people owned 
a pony and trap, her father had one    
because he had the shop.               
     There was no electricity, TV,     
videos and computers.In the mornings   
they filled the oil lamps up ready for 
the evening.                           
     " I don't like the way the        
countryside has changed because some   
farmers have ploughed right over the   
public rights of way" she told us.     </content>
