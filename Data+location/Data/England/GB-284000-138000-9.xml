		<title>09Puppy Walking, Exford</title>
		<content> Every year the Foxhounds give us a    
 puppy about a month old. I have to    
 take it for a walk on a lead every    
 day.The huntsman brings us flesh for  
 it to eat and we give it milk. It gets
 bigger and stronger all the time. It  
 plays with our other sheepdogs,it can 
 jump high and run as fast as me.It has
 to have injections and it has a number
 inside its ear.After we have it for   
 about 8 months it goes back to the    
 Kennels.When it is time for the puppy 
 show,we go and see all the young      
 hounds together.They are put in a shed
 and called out with their brothers and
 sisters.The judge sees which six      
 hounds are the best.Last year ours was
 just out ,he was number seven.Perhaps 
 this year ours will be the best of    
 all.
