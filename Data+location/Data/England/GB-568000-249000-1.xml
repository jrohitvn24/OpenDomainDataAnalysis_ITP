		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area is typical of this part of   
{Suffolk,}with large fields of wheat   
 and oil-seed rape, small woods used as
 cover for game, and scattered farms   
 and villages. Farmers strive to retain
 the character of the land be planting 
 new trees to replace elms recently    
 ravaged by Dutch elm disease, and     
 leaving some of the interesting       
 hedgerows. The main road from         
{Haverhill}to{Bury St. Edmunds}        
 (A143) passes through the area        
 rerouted in 1939 when R.A.F.          
 Stradishall was built. The site of the
 airfield is now H.M. Prison,          
{Highpoint.}Although very much a       
 farming area there is a chemical      
 works,{Wychem,}and a private school   
{Barnardiston Hall.}                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
