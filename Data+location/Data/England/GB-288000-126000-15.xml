		<title>15Many events in Dulverton</title>
		<content> For a small town like Dulverton       
 suddenly this year there seems to be  
 lots going on.                        
 Firstly a{Trim Trail}was built. With  
 the help of the Royal Engineers, we   
 have a track on the recreation field  
 with 12 stations where you can keep   
 fit, or just play. For instance there 
 are some balancing bars, some ropes to
 climb and some ladders to hang from.  
 Then the Water Authority is spending  
 thousands of pounds on a{Flood        
{Prevention Scheme.}They have built    
 walls and banks along the river,      
 excavating the silting up under the   
 bridge, and are putting in a huge     
 overflow pipe to take away flood water
 from the stream that runs under the   
 houses and streets of Dulverton.      
{Two Squash courts}are being built and 
 twelve new houses are being           
 constructed.                          </content>
