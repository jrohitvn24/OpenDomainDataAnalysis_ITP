		<content> The huge Basford Hall marshalling yard
 (22 miles of track) south of Crewe    
 Station and the smaller sidings at    
 Gresty Green were constantly busy 50  
 years ago splitting up and remaking   
 freight trains. Many lines and men are
 now gone. In 1960 approx. 260 men     
 worked at Basford Hall; today about   
 30. Freight liner traffic is important
 and Gresty Green where new rail track 
 is amade up. The old goods shed is now
 a private warehouse. Crewe South      
 engine shed and its turntable are now 
 gone. The B.R. vehicle repair shop has
 been taken over by National Carriers. 
 Only the carriage sheds are still used
 for their original purpose. Remains of
 World War 2 air-raid shelters can     
 still be seen in th surrounding       
 fields.
