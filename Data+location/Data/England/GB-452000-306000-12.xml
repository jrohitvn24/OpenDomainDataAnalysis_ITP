		<title>12LOCAL ATTITUDES TO ANSTEY</title>
		<content>{ANSTEY VILLAGE}                       
 A small survey conducted by local     
 school children showed that people    
 think Anstey is tidy and safe to live 
 in.                                   
 They would like to see more trees     
 and flowers, with less parking along  
 the roads. Above all, people want a   
 village health centre.                
 Most people are satisfied with local  
 schools and do not wish to move from  
 the village for any reason. Heavy     
 traffic is a nuisance and more        
 policeman would be an advantage.      
 The local population like living in   
 Anstey, because it is close to        
 Leicester City, Bradgate Park and open
 countryside.                          
 However, there are fears that the     
 closeness of the new town, Beaumont   
 Leys, will turn Anstey into a dead    
 village.                              </content>
