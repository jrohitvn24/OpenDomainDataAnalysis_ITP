		<title>16MILLERS TRACTOR YARD</title>
		<content> On Tuesday we went down to Millers    
 farm.                                 
 The  Millers have two trucks of their 
 own and one hired truck . They sell   
  second-hand tractors and they also   
 hire out farm equipment of all kinds. 
 When we were at Millers farm they     
 had 25 tractors but they have some-   
 times had over 100 in the yard. They  
 repair tractors  and spray them and   
 steam clean them and deliver them all 
 over the world .The furthest they've  
 been is Pakistan and they've been to  
 Greece and Turkey and Africa and      
 Americas . They have been in business 
 for 35 years . They employ  7 men who 
 start work at half past 8 in the      
 morning. We saw 3 combines,one was    
  burnt out, and a tractor that was    
 burnt out too. The men strip          
 out the burnt pieces and put in new   
 parts.                                </content>
