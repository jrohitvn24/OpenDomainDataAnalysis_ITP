		<title>15HAUNTED FELBRIGG HALL?</title>
		<content>  There have been many varied stories  
 of ghosts haunting Felbrigg Hall.     
  An old lady was interviewed who had  
 been a parlour maid at the Hall when  
 she was a teenager.  She particularly 
 remembered two strange events.  When  
 she passed an upstairs door, her      
 candle often went out.  Also, when she
 opened a particular door, she could   
 hear a voice saying "Come in", but    
 there was no-one there.  These may not
 seem very strange, but the same thing 
 happened to another maid.             
  The maids were not scared by any of  
 these events, but assumed that it was 
 the ghost of a lady who had occupied  
 the rooms previously.                 
  There does not, however, appear to be
 any recorded sighting of a lady or any
 other ghost in Felbrigg Hall.
