		<title>17IVAN KESSEL GARAGES</title>
		<content>  In 1959 Ivan Kessel started business 
 by the Summercourt crossroads selling 
 petrol and cars. In 1963 he became a  
 Volvo dealer. In 1964 he bought land  
 across the road to enlarge his        
 business. The garage sold petrol until
 1970. Around that time the business   
 spread to other towns in Cornwall to  
 increase his sale of cars.            
   In 1984 the garage sold 740 cars and
 about 7.2 people out of 10 came back  
 to buy again. On the new site he built
 a servicing station. He sells Volvo   
 and Mitsubishi vehicles.The           
 Mitsubushis come from Tokyo and       
 the Volvos come from Sweden.The       
 company relies on advertisment and the
 use of the telephone to sell its cars 
 because it is a village business.
