		<title>04The day of a farmer's son</title>
		<content> It's the digital alarm that wakes me  
 up on this Thursday morning, even     
 though the Cockerel had woken up hours
 before now. Turning on my stereo I    
 quickly roll back the quilt on my bed 
 and open the door in the shower room  
 and turned on the light in the room.  
 It's then a quick trip downstairs to  
 turn on the hot water, this is so that
 the water will heat up more quickly.  
 This is about 7.30 am. And then it's  
 eventually into the red hot shower for
 a freshen up. After the wash it's     
 downstairs to breakfast. I need to    
 hurry though to catch the private bus 
 to Badger's Cross just up the road    
 from us. This happens at roughly 8.00 
 am.I leave to catch the bus about ten 
 minutes before the bus goes. This     
 gives me time to get my bag packed and
 get myself and my bike out to Badger's
 Cross.                                </content>
