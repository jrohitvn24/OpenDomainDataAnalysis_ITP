		<content>    Verwood C.E.School was opened in   
 its present premises in 1847.Before   
 this date a school had been held in   
 the adjacent church,'St. Michael and  
 All Angels' for children of the poor. 
    The building was of red brick with 
 a gabled roof and had two connected   
 schoolrooms,(each 6m by 5.5m).These   
 were to cater for 120 children aged   
 from 5 to 8.                          
    A four roomed Teacher's house was  
 joined to the school via a lobby.The  
 teacher was to be paid Â£20 a year ,   
 suplimented by the children's school  
 fees-a halfpenny a week or sixpence a 
 quarter.                              
    The cost of the school building was
 Â£220,exclusive of the land,which was  
 given for this purpose by Squire      
 Fryer,a local land owner.
