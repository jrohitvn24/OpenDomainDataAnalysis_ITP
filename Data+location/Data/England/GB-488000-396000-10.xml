		<title>10Scotton/Northorpe: Trade</title>
		<content> Both villages have a general shop with
 post office facilities providing a    
 valuable service; fresh bread is      
 delivered here daily. The range of    
 goods stocked is limited and most     
 families shop (weekly) at Gainsborough
 or Scunthorpe. There is a daily (week-
 day) doorstep milk delivery; other    
 tradesmen's vans call weekly or more  
 frequently, with meat, fresh fish and 
 coal. A window cleaner calls every    
 fortnight; Scotton has a resident self
 employed plumber, car repairer, house 
 decorator, removal man and several    
 builders. Northorpe has 2/3 builders, 
 a painter, decorator and joiner (who  
 is also an undertaker). There is a    
 daily weekday house to house postal   
 delivery, with a morning and afternoon
 collection of mail from each P.O. Most
 houses have a phone and there is a    
 public phone box in both villages.    </content>
