		<content> One local man told us about a local   
 history.The teachers smacked the legs 
 of the children. He used to ride to   
 school. He didn't play football or    
 athletics but did play cricket. He    
 didn't like music and he didn't go to 
 discos. He wore grey shorts and grey  
 shirts. He went to bed about          
 10 o'clock.  He only had a television 
 when he was nine. There were  five    
 children  in their family and they had
 few roast dinners.                    
                   There were only a   
 few houses in the village when he     
 moved there 45 years ago,and the roads
 were very narrow.Since then new houses
 have been built and roads improved    
 These are the main changes he has     
 noticed.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
