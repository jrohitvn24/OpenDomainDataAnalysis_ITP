		<title>17HEALTH IN DATCHWORTH</title>
		<content> The{doctors}for this area are part of 
 a group pratice which has its surgery 
 in the nearby village of Knebworth.The
 nearest{general hospital}is the Lister
 hospital in Old Stevenage.According to
 a local G.P. this area is a relatively
 healthy one due to the fact that there
 is no heavy industrial plant within   
 the locality and the fact that most   
 people are employed in light manual or
 non-manual occupations.The only       
 special health problems connected with
 this rural area are those associated  
 with hay fever and its related        
 allergies.                            
 Local doctors think that the greatest 
 changes for the future will be :a) A  
 further move towards preventative     
 medicine. b) More health education and
 c) A sizeable population of old       
 people.
