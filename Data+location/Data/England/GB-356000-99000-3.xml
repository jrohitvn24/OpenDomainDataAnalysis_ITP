		<content> The small village of Wraxall,         
 consisting of 16 houses, is separated 
 into two parts, with church and       
 Jacobean Manor House in separate      
 valleys.   The remaining dwellings all
 date from before the last century     
 The hamlet of Chalmington, with 13    
 houses, contains a manor house with   
 small ornamental park and lodge.   The
 former stables of the manor have been 
 converted into two dwelling houses.   
 Three modern dwellings have been      
 erected, the remainder of the houses  
 being of much earlier date.           
 Two former mills in isolated          
 positions on the banks of the River   
 Frome have now been converted into    
 dwelling houses.                      
 The hamlet of Sandhills consists of   
 eight houses, one a former public     
 house.                                
                                       </content>
