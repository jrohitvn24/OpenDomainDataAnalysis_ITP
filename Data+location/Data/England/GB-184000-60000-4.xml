		<title>04CHURCH /PART 2/ FLOWERS</title>
		<content> Inside the church there is a reed     
 organ which looks like lots of pipes  
 with holes in. On one of the window   
 sills there is a statue of a head and 
 shoulders of a man who looks Norman   
 Also there are more usual things like 
 an altar, wooden pews and there are   
 quite elaborate stained glass windows.
 At the back of the church there is a  
 table with leaflets, postcards and    
 there is also a visitors book with    
 names of people from Canada, Wales    
 America, California and different     
 parts of Britain.   {FLOWERS:}        
    The dog rose is a wild rose which  
 is white or pink. It is said to be bad
 luck to bring these into the house    
 because they carry the devil in them. 
    Bluebells are blue but can be pink 
 or white. They are wild and grow in   
 shady clearings or hedgerows,         
 blooming from March to June           </content>
