		<content> The five schools which took part in   
 the sports on Sawley village green on 
 17th,July 1985 were Galphay,North     
 Stainley,Sawley,Sharow and Skelton.   
 Parents brought the children in cars. 
 Children were divided into five teams 
 with some from each school in every   
 team.We started with the infant flat  
 races.When they had finished the real 
 fun started.There were 5 games.They   
 were called Shot put,Bean bags in     
 bucket,Goal shooting and Two jumps.We 
 had to do each game in turn.Juniors in
 each team did all the games first then
 the infants followed.One person from  
 each team would take a score card to  
 the scoreboard at the end of each     
 game.We all had a drink at the        
 interval.then the wining team did a   
 lap of honour.There followed more flat
 races for the juniors and two for     
 parents.                              </content>
