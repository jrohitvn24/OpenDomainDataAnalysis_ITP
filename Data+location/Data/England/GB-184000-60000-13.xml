		<content> The {PORTH RESERVOIR}was{built        
{to }supply Newquay with water. The    
 reservoir was constructed  25-26      
 years ago covering about 4o acres and 
 is now a major feature of the         
 landscape around Newquay. Only anglers
 and permit holders are allowed access 
 and Brown and Rainbow trout fishing   
 is available. {ST.MAWGAN CHAPEL}(built
 1877)is now used by peace campaigners 
 who are against recent government     
 spending on nuclear weapons. It       
 consists of a wooden floored room with
 a small front porch. There are benches
 inside containing cushions embroidered
 with the Dove of Peace. A prayer of   
 peace can be found on the wall near   
 the altar and the door is always kept 
 unlocked so that people can enter for 
 prayer.Meetings are held every Sunday.
