		<title>15TONY'S TEA BAR</title>
		<content> A well known land mark in Wood Green  
 is the{Tea Bar}on the west side of    
 Ducketts Common.  The Tea Bar is owned
 by a gentleman called Tony.  He has   
 owned the Tea Bar for seven years.  He
 sells coffee, tea, sandwiches and     
 rolls.  Some of his{customers}are from
 well know television programmes.  Tony
 likes working there because the people
 make him laugh and he has made many   
 friends among his regular customers.  
{The van}in which Tony works is 90     
 years old.  It was originally a Horse 
 drawn carriage.  It still has wheels  
 but they have sunk into the ground.   
 Before the war the van was in the     
 Middle of the road close to Turnpike  
 Lane Station, but it was moved to be  
 closer to the nearby air raid shelter.
  He has no partners but each day Tony 
 has his dog called Jason to keep him  
 company.                              </content>
