		<content>CONWAY'S BRIDGE.                       
In 1752,General Conway called in Thomas
Gainsborough,the Congregational        
Minister at Henley,as Engineer for a   
Bridge over HAPPY VALLEY.He transported
large stones from Reading Abbey.It was 
known then as Ragged Arches.Today,it is
Conway's Bridge in the Wargrave Road.  
Twenty years ago,some of the woodland  
was cleared in the Happy Valley &amp; it is
now a private Golf Course.             
The Area marked "WORKS" on the map is  
the site of a tunnel used in the Second
World War for storing aircraft parts - 
Spitfires.                             
"WOODLANDS" on the map is where Conway 
built a large Still House with coke    
ovens &amp; he planted 20 acres of lavender
The heads were distilled &amp; the oil was 
sold.The Lavender Plantation was unique
in the country.There are 200 acres of  
wood now.The land reaches Crazies Hill.</content>
