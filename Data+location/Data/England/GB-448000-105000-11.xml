		<title>11Growing Hydroponic Tomatoes</title>
		<content>  There are two green houses covering  
{six thousand square metres.}The       
 tomatoes are grown from seeds planted 
 in{rockwool}and don't require soil but
 are grown in{well-oxygenated}running  
 water.This is pumped round the plants 
 in pipes from a tank which holds ten  
 thousand litres.The water must not be 
 hard and{acids}are added to make the  
 PH number low.The plants are hung upon
 string, attached to a wire.No chemical
 insecticides are used.Instead they use
 a moth called{"Encasia"}which lays its
 eggs in White Fly eggs which the moth 
 grubs then eat.The seeds are sown     
 on October fifteenth and picking      
 begins in February.A computer controls
 the heat of the greenhouses and checks
 the{weather}for wind temperature and  
 ventilation.The computer also controls
 the{nutrients}and the acids which are 
 added to the water.                   </content>
