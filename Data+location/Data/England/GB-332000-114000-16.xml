		<content> We had these shops in the 1950's ,that
 are not here now.A clothes shop and   
 two grocery stores.                   
  There was a post office and an egg   
 factory.The village hall used to be   
 near Paul's Lane which was called     
 Tiffen Lane.                          
                                       
 The weekly after-war rationing was a  
 quarter pound of meat each ,2 ounces  
 of cheese ,2 ounces of butter and 2   
 ounces  of sugar each.                
                                       
 Going to the cinema was very popular  
 because hardly anyone had a           
 television. Today it is the other way 
 round.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
