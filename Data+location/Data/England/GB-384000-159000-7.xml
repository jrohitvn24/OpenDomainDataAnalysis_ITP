		<content>   We did a survey on all the farms in 
 our area. Most of the land in         
 the area which is not used for housing
 or shops is used for farming, most of 
 which is dairy farming.               
   All the dairy farms have at least a 
 hundred acres each. They use their    
 land for grass and to make hay and    
 silage. Most of the herds consist of  
 Friesian cows for milking, but the    
 farmers also keep beef cows and two of
 them have bulls. All the dairy cattle 
 are milked at least twice a day using 
 modern machinery. All the animals on  
 the dairy farms are kept inside from  
 November to April. There is a large   
 cattle market in nearby Chippenham    
 where most of the buying and selling  
 of the cattle in the area takes place.
   There is one pig farm that has over 
 two thousand pigs. The pigs are kept  
 for 18 months and then sold for bacon.</content>
