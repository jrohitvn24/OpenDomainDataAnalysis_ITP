		<content> It was North of Millbrook Road &amp; West 
 of &amp; including the T.A.V.R centre. It 
 is a residential area. The houses     
 were mainly old 1930s with a few      
 modern ones here &amp; there. The houses  
 were mainly semi_detached with a few  
 terraced &amp; a few detatched. There were
 no bungalows or blocks of flats. The  
 houses were mostly made of brick &amp;    
 pebbledash. The people look after     
 their houses very well. Many houses   
 had had alterations such as window    
 replacements. The gardens were also   
 looked after very well. Millbrook Road
 was busy. The other roads were quiet. 
 The area has no problems except the   
 occasional smell of tobacco from the  
 B.A.T. factory and sewage smells.
