<title>21Baby Sitting Circle</title>
<content>

The baby sitting circle continues to meet each month, usually at one of the "sitters" homes. Many of the families now have grandchildren so we meet to enjoy one anothers company rather than sitting. There is still a pot luck supper although we drink less wine and a little more tea and coffee now! Our conversations range from topical news items, "new" child rearing techniques, health issues and village news. Most of the families have known each other since the circle began in 1978 so we're almost family now and still great support for each other.The men meet each December for a trip to various local pubs and an Indian meal to follow.   &lt;br />
