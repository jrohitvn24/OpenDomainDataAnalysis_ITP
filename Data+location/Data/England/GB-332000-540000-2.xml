		<content>    The area is dominated by Warnell   
 Fell which is part enclosed and part  
 unfenced rough grazing.  The Eastern  
 and Southern slopes of Warnell above  
 the River Caldew are commercial       
 softwood forests.                     
    The geological formation is carbon-
 iferous limestone, millstone grit and 
 the edge of an area of sand on the    
 Eastern bank of the River Caldew.     
    There is a limestone quarry on     
 Warnell Fell and a few old limekilns  
 still existing on the fellside.       
    Stone walls and wire fences are the
 usual boundaries  with some thorn     
 hedges on the lower ground.           
    New farm buildings are mainly steel
 structures with asbestos or onduline  
 roofs.  Older farm buildings are be-  
 coming derelict as they are of little 
 commercial value and not easy to use  
 in conjunction with modern machinery. </content>
