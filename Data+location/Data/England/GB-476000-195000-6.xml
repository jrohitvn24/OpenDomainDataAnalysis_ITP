		<title>06     MOTORWAY _ M40.</title>
		<content> The section of the M40 which cuts the 
 S.W.corner of our area,was begun in   
 1969.As a result Stokenchurch &amp;       
 Studley Green are much quieter but not
 much safer villages &amp; local trade does
 not seem to have suffered,(a transport
 cafe is still full most nights.) New  
 houses built right by the motorway    
 suffer from its noise.                
  Beyond Stokenchurch,where a{P.O.     
{telecommunications tower}boosts T.V.  
 signals &amp; links satellite             
 communications between Goonhilly &amp;    
 London,lies Aston Rowant Nature       
 Reserve.Local amenity groups contested
 the proposed route of the M40 through 
 a cutting here.The government went    
 ahead but the{Nature Conservancy      
{Council's}suggestions for the         
 preservation of the landscape were    
 accepted.These included sowing grass  
 seed suited to the{chalk banks.       </content>
