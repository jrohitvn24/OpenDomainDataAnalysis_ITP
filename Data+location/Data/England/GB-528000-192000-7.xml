		<content> This is a pleasant residential area   
 consisting mainly of owner-occupied   
 semi_detached houses.  An average     
 house now costs between Â£65,000 and   
 Â£70,000.  A small minority of the     
 population is of Asian, Greek Cypriot 
 and Turkish Cypriot origin.  The focal
 point of the area is Hampden Square, a
 small shopping centre served by       
 several bus routes. Oak Hill Park, an 
 extensive area of open parkland with  
 oak and willow trees, offers local    
 recreational facilities which include:
 miniature golf; bowling; football     
 pitches.  Several local schools use   
 the park for their sporting           
 activities.  Passing through the park 
 and also part of the residential  area
 is Pymmes Brook which supports a      
 variety of flora.  Pasture near       
 Oakhill Theological College is used   
 for grazing heifers during the summer.</content>
