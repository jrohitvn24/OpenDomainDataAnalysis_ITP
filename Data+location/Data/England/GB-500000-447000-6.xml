		<title>06Beswick &amp; Watton C.E. School</title>
		<content> This is the local Primary School,     
 serving the communities of Beswick,   
 Watton and Kilnwick, and nearby       
 farmsteads such as Bracken. It is a   
 Church of England school, controlled  
 by Humberside Education Authority.    
 Built in the 1850's through the Hotham
 family, the school buildings comprise 
 one large classroom which also serves 
 as hall and dining-room, one small    
 room, two entrance porches and a small
 scullery. There are indoor toilets for
 boys, girls and staff. A range of     
 outbuildings include outdoor toilets, 
 caretaker's store and two former coke 
 stores which are now storage sheds. A 
 wooden hut houses P.E. equipment.     
 There are two small yards, a large    
 playground and a sports field.        
 The nearby School House, intended as  
 the Head Teacher's residence, is      
 presently occupied by a LEA officer.  </content>
