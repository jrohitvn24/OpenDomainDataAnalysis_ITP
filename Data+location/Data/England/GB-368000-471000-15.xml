		<title>15Housing in Ingleton</title>
		<content> The person we interviewed, Daisy      
 Thistlethwaite, said she used to live 
 at Greenwood Leghe which is now a     
 caravan site by Moorgarth Garage      
 owned by Mr Stocks who also owns the  
 house.We asked Mrs Thistlethwaite that
 if she had a choice between any house 
 in Ingleton which house she would     
 choose.But she didn't want to move and
 didn't regret moving she says it's    
 private and near the shops,but when   
 she moved to Bank Hall she didn't move
 into a younger house as Bank Hall is  
 ten years older than Greenwood Leghe.
