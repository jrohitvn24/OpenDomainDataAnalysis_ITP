		<title>12Family Life in Codnor  1</title>
		<content>   My name is Sarah Starbuck. I live in
 a terraced house with three rooms     
 upstairs and three downstairs. There  
 are four people in my family, my mum  
 and dad, my sister Andrea and me.We   
 have two pet dogs,Kimie and Goldie and
 my hamster,Hazel.                     
   My mum works about twenty-one hours 
 a week in the Qwik Save supermarket in
 Ripley. I think it is a hard job      
 because she has to learn the prices of
 over a hundred items and get to know  
 all the regular customers.            
   My dad works as a butcher for       
 Dewhurst's. He has to go to different 
 places each week.Last year he was     
 offered promotion in Sunderland,but we
 didn't move as we would be too far    
 from our relations.                   
   In my spare time I go swimming and I
 do gardening.My favourite subject at  
 school is Maths.                   {SS</content>
