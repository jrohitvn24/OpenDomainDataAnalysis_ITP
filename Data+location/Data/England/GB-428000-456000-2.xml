		<content>    After the Second World War many    
 changes were made in Bilton. Houses   
 were built in large numbers and the   
 population figure has risen to well   
 over 5000. New schools, better roads, 
 recreation facilities and shops and   
 public transport have been provided.  
 Most of Bilton's farms have become    
 housing estates, but these are on the 
 edge of the{Nidd Gorge}still well     
 wooded and the centre of a            
 conservation scheme to preserve       
 wildlife and the rural landscape for  
 future generations. Public footpaths  
 are being approved from Batchelor     
 Gardens, through the Nidd Woods to the
{Nidd Viaduct,}no longer used by the   
 railway, and then along the river to  
 Bilton Hall and on to{Knaresborough.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
