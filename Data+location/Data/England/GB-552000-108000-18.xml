		<title>18The Village Shop.</title>
		<content> The shop has been in Upper Dicker     
 since 1844.When Mr. and Mrs. Carr took
 over in 1977 they added 3             
 refrigerators and a new floor.Seventy 
 percent of the population has changed.
 There used to be another shop called  
 Hentie's Store,opposite St. Bede's,   
 which has now added 300 to the village
 population.Customers come from within 
 a 3 mile radius to buy food and use   
 the Post Office.The Social Services   
 are in constant touch with the shop   
 because of deliveries to the old and  
 immobile within the area.Mr.Carr      
 travels to Arlington to deliver       
 groceries and pension to an old man   
 who lives alone and cannot walk.St.   
 Bede's pupils use the village shop as 
 a tuck shop and buy drinks,sweets     
 etc.If the shop disappears many old   
 people will suffer.A government       
 organisation, COSIRA may help.        </content>
