		<title>18VISITING HAMPTON WATERWORKS</title>
		<content>   In October 1984 the 4th year of     
 Hampton Junior School visited the     
 waterworks and apart from Nichola's   
 asthma attack everything went         
 smoothly.  We saw the filter beds,    
 the chlorination house and the pumping
 station.  We were the first school    
 party to climb to the top of the      
 pumping station which was thoroughly  
 enjoyed as we had an excellent view of
 Hampton and the river.                
   On the 17th of January 1985 during a
 cold spell three Victorian watermains 
 burst in Hampton.  The nearest one was
 in Oldfield Road.  It flooded the     
 school, the nearby housing estate and 
 turned the railway track at Hampton   
 Station into a river.  Many children  
 could not leave their homes that      
 morning to come to school because of  
 the flooding.                         
                                       </content>
