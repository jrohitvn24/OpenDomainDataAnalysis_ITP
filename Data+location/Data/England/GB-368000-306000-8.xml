 divided into 3 parts, which are 1.    
{amusement,}2.{peaceful areas and lakes
 and 3.{field study areas.}The park is 
 used for enjoyment. The main proposed 
 change is to have a{leisure}park. Many
 people go to the{Town Park}to walk,   
 cycle, fish, play, birdwatch, picnic, 
 relax and to watch shows in the       
 Amphitheatre. The{Town Park}has been  
 there for about 16 years.             
 At the moment the{Telford Development 
{Corporation }is plannng to build      
 houses on the{Town Park.}Because of   
 this{H.O.O.P}(hands off our park) has 
 been formed . Also{H.O.O.P}is campain-
 ing against the plan to privatize part
 of the{Town Park}so that you have to  
 pay to go into it. This part of the   
{Town Park}will be called the{Theme    
{Park.
