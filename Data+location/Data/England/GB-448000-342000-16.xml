		<title>16  New Road near Strelley</title>
		<content>   An owner-occupier on the{Bilborough 
{Estate}says:                          
  "Personally it will be very good for 
 me because it's going to cut the      
 traffic that travels in front of my   
 house by half. And because of how     
 they've built the road I don't think  
 it has spoilt the park. But one thing 
 bothers me about the new road: is it  
 going to be difficult for us to cross 
 it when we want to go up to Strelley  
 village for a walk? The new road will 
 be a main road to the M1 and obviously
 the traffic will be going at great    
 speed."                               
   A{Strelley Villager}says:           
  "I think the new road will be a good 
 thing because it will cut off the     
 village even more than it is now and  
 may help to preserve it by creating a 
 more-easiy defended boundary."
