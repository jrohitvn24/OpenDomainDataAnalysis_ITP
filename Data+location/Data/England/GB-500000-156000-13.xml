{Woking Park}.This is the only park in 
 our area. It is quite a big park-43   
 acres. There is a lot to do like crazy
 golf, putting, cricket, bowling,      
 tennis, and there is an outdoor       
 swimming pool. The park is known for  
 its trees and floral displays. It     
 provides enjoyable walks. The park has
 a children's playground and a duck    
 enclosure. Next to the park is the    
 Leisure Centre.
