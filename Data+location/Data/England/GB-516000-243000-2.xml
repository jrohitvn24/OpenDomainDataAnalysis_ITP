		<content> In the town centre the Market House,  
 now a restaurant, and the White Hart  
 public house are both Tudor buildings,
 although much restored. The Crown     
 public house is mid-Georgian, while   
 St. Andrew's Church is mainly in the  
 Perpendicular style, with a grandly   
 vaulted south porch. The former mill  
 on the river Ivel has now been con-   
 verted into residential flats. Most   
 other housing was built during the    
 20th century, with a substantial      
 amount dating from well before the    
 1939-45 world war. There are now      
 many large modern private housing     
 estates, together with some 12-1300   
 council houses.
