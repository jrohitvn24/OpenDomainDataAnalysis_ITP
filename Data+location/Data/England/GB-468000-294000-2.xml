		<title>02LIFE STYLE BOY WEEKEND</title>
		<content>    On Saturday Dad, my brother and    
 I normally go out to the shops and mum
 stays at home and puts the dirty      
 washing in the washing machine. We    
 look in shops and sometimes buy       
 things. My brother normally buys      
 fishing things he goes to the toy shop
 to buy some fishing floats. At home I 
 play with my friend Charles and if he 
 is not in I watch the T.V. Dad is     
 sometimes up in the loft painting it. 
 It is going to be our play room. We   
 have got a toaster which toasts       
 sandwiches and we have them for tea.  
 On Sundays I play with Charles and we 
 play on bikes. For dinner we have     
 roast potatoes, meat, carrots, gravy  
 and sometimes beans. I go to bed at   
 about half past eight.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
