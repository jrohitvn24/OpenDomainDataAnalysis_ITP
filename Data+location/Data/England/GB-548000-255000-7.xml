		<title>07FULBOURN HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Fulbourn Hospital is the area hospital
 for the mentally ill; the neighbouring
 Ida Darwin Hospital is for mentally   
 handicapped patients.                 
 We spoke to a nurse from the Drinks   
 Problem Unit at Fulbourn Hospital, who
 said that the general aim is to       
 rehabilitate the patients as soon as  
 possible. The patients stay for       
 varying lengths of time, usually on a 
 voluntary basis, and undergo therapy  
 and treatment as well as having       
 different activities such as sports,  
 entertainments and occasional outings.
  Patients can walk round, but not     
 outside, the grounds. This is because 
 of the temptation to have a drink, and
 also because of the danger to         
 themselves if they are on drugs -     
 though the policy is to minimse drug  
 administration.
