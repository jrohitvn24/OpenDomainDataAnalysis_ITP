		<content>Mr. Hunter told us about Vicarage Farm 
which he owns. It has 220 acres valued 
at 1700 - 2000 pounds per acre. This   
acreage is divided into 140 acres of   
cereals and 80 acres of grass.         
   The 140 acres of cereal comprise 60 
acres barley, 60 acres wheat and 20    
acres oats. If these crops produce a   
good quality yield they will be used   
for human consumption but if they do   
not reach the required standard they   
will be used for animal feed.          
   The grassland is used for cattle and
is made up of permanent pasture and    
grass leys. The 160 head of cattle are 
bought in at 2 weeks old from dairy    
farms and sold at 18 months to be      
fattened for beef.                     
   Mr. Hunter's farming is traditional 
with English cattle and standard crops.
He employs one workman and relies      
heavily on powerful machinery.         </content>
