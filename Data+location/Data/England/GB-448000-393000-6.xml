		<title>06Comparing 1850 &amp; 1985 maps.</title>
		<content> There are{more roads}on the{newer map 
 than the older map.The 1985 map has   
{more built up areas}than the 1850 map.
 There are no built up areas towards   
 Silverwood and Gulling wood on the old
 map.The{old map doesn't show the      
{dismantled railway;}it shows it on the
 1985 map so it must have been built   
 and pulled down in that time.There was
{not a motorway}on the{1850 map}because
 cars were not invented then.On the    
 1850 map Holly house is a farm but on 
 the 1985 Holly house has been         
 changed to Ravenfield Grange.There was
{a guide post}at{Micklebring}on the    
{1850 map}but it is not there now on   
 the 1985 map.Near Holly house         
 Braithwell Road on the 1850 map,it is 
 not a built up area but on the 1985   
 map there are now many houses.{On Moor
{lane South} at the{crossroads}it is a 
{more built up area}on the 1985 map.   </content>
