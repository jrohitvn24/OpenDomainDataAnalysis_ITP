		<title>19A rural studies museum</title>
		<content> Just outside Launceston at a hamlet   
 called Tremeale is a rural studies    
 museum.  Last year roughly 2,000      
 adults and children came to the museum
 which was started by Mr Howe out of   
 personal interest. The museum houses  
 machinery from the farms nearby and   
 transport from the past.The oldest    
 piece of machinery is a cider mill    
 which is 240 years old and an apple   
 crusher whch is over 200 years old.   
 The buildings in which the machinery  
 is kept are over 295 years old and on 
 the land around are shire             
 horses,jersey cows and a few hens as  
 well as domestic pets. The museum     
 proves that life on the farm today is 
 much safer than 100 years ago. The    
 admission charge is 60p for adults and
 30p for children. The museum is well  
 worth a visit .
