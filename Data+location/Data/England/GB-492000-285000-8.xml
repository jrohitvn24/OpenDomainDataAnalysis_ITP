		<content> Harpers Brook flows through the parish
 of Brigstock. It rises from some small
 springs north of Desborough and flows 
 some 15 miles in an easterly          
 direction. It passes through the      
 grounds of what was once{Pipewell     
{Abbey}and was mentioned in 1135 by the
 monks there as Harpers Broke. It joins
 the river Nene about 1\ miles from    
 Thrapston.  In Brigstock full use was 
 made of the water, the moat round the 
 Manor House was filled from the brook.
 it also supplied the royal fish ponds 
 which were situated on the north side 
 of Bridge Street in the meadow known  
 as Fish Pond Meadow.  On its banks    
 were tannyards and later a fellmonger 
 all of which made use of the water.   
 There was a water mill mentioned in   
 the Doomsday Book.  At the beginning  
 of the century, perch, roach, dace and
 eels were found in the water.         </content>
