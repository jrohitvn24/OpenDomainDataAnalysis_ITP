		<content> There are no council built properties 
 in our block and most of the          
 properties are owner/occupied as well 
 as a small number of 'tied cottages'  
 which are owned by the farmers.  The  
 farm workers live in these cottages   
 and pay the farmer a nominal rent.    
 There are few privately rented        
 properties but a lot of old cottages  
 are being sold and renovated.         
 All homes are connected to mains      
 electricity and most are now connected
 to mains sewerage but there are still 
 a few which use a 'cesspit'.
