		<title>07A schoolboy from Breamore</title>
		<content> I have nearly always lived in         
 Breamore.I have lived in Hope         
 Cottage,Home Farm,Outwick Farm and now
 in Dairy Cottage. My Dad was brought  
 up in Breamore by my Nan who still    
 lives down the road.                  
 I get up about six thirty and have    
 breakfast. Then I set off for my paper
 round which takes me round the marsh  
 and along Upper Street. I do many rich
 and important houses like that of Sir 
 Westrow Hulse. Lady Hulse is very nice
 to me.                                
 I have to walk about half a mile to   
 catch the bus for Burgate School.I    
 enjoy walking around Breamore         
 especially on my way home from        
 school.I can get into Breamore House  
 and the Museum free.The trouble is,   
 though , that I don't see my friends  
 as much as I'd like.They live too far 
 away.                                 </content>
