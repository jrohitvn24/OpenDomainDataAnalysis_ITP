		<content> We surveyed the factories in our own  
 square &amp; we found that working        
 conditions are generally clean, tidy, 
 &amp; pleasant to work in. Most factories 
 have approximately one hour for lunch 
 but some factories work right through 
 depending on what kind of job they do.
 Breaks for tea &amp; coffee are usually   
 about ten to fifteen minutes.         
                                       
 Holidays in most factories are roughly
 three to four weeks a year plus a     
 couple of days for a bank holiday.    
                                       
 Working times in the factories are    
 roughly thirty to fourty hours a week.
