		<title>13SWALLOW CLIFF BAY</title>
		<content> Thousands of years ago near Swallow   
 Cliff Bay, was a volcano and in 1985  
 if you went there you could see a     
 large piece of rock formed by the     
 lava.  On our trip to Swallow Cliff   
 Bay we saw the piece of lava.  We     
 climbed up some of the rocks and near 
 the top some of the rocks were made of
 snails and sea creatures' shells..    
 They had been there 300,000,000       
 years and you could tell they were    
 old because some of the rocks were    
 rotting away.                         
 Swallow Cliff Bay is a pebble beach   
 and you can find lots of sea animals  
 there like dog-whelk, periwinkle,     
 different species of crabs and many   
 other sea creatures.  Sheep from the  
 adjoining fields sometimes climb down 
 to drink from the rock pools.         
                                       
                                       </content>
