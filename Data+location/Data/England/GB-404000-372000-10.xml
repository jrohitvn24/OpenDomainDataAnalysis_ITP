		<title>10Farming, Buxton.</title>
		<content>  The town of Buxton lies in the valley
 of the River Wye; the farmland        
 surrounding the town is only suitable 
 as pastureland between the edges of   
 the town and the start of the heather 
 moorlands of the Peak District.       
 There are only three working farms    
 left in Fairfield.                    
 Three other farms are not working now.
  The land is sold or rented.          
 Staden Farm and Slade Hill Farm to the
 S.E. of the town are both dairy farms.
 Nithen End Farm and Cold Springs Farm 
 on the Long Hill road both stock      
 cattle and sheep, but Cold Springs    
 Farm is also one of Buxton's main     
 camping sites.                        
 There are also a number of allotments,
 but the climate is not particularly   
 kind towards vegetable growers and the
 plots in the Fairfield area are       
 largely overgrown.                    </content>
