 in {1843.}It has cob walls except     
 for the extention which was built     
 in {1981}and is four years old.

 for meetings of{brownies,}pre-school  
{playgroup}and{sunday school.}The      
 three cottages, of which one is now   
 the {chapel,}were built by the        
 Young Family.{The chapel}cottage      
 was bought for{Â£30}by some members    
 of the congregation. Before that      
 meetings were held on the village     
 green. The only remains of the        
 upstairs of the cottage is the balcony
 or{gallery.}The gallery is now used to
 store{play-group }equipment.The front
