		<content>     If you walk along{Bolton Road}you 
 have Bolton road all around you. There
 are lots of{pubs}on Bolton road. I    
 counted ten when I went along it. I   
 don't know why we have so many pubs.  
 It must be because{Pendlebury}is on   
 the main road between{Manchester}and  
{Bolton}and if people get thirsty they 
 can stop for a drink on the way. Some 
 of the shops are a bit old fashioned  
 but you can buy most things from them.
 The best one is the bike shop. I've   
 got a{BMX}and if I need any spare     
 parts I can get them from there.{I'm  
{glad I don't live in the countryside  
 because you have to go miles to get to
 the shops. The only trouble with the  
 shops in Pendlebury is for the{old    
{people}who live in old people's flats 
 and they are a long way from the      
 shops.{If I were the Mayor I'd give   
{them shops close to where they live.  </content>
