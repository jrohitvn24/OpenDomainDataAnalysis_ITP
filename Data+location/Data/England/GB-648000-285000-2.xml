		<content> This former state primary school is   
 now a private co-educational          
 preparatory school catering for       
 approximately 100 children between the
 ages of 5 - 13 years. With one or two 
 exceptions the pupils do not live in  
 the locla area but are transported by 
 private means. Most travel 8-15km into
 school with maximum distances up to 25
 km. The towns of Beccles, Oulton      
 Broad, Lowestoft and Southwold are the
 main catchment centres. The teaching  
 staff live outside the area but the   
 caretaker lives locally.
