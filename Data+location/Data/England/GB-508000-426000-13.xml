		<title>13THE WATERFRONT COMPLEX HULL</title>
		<content> On the side of Princes dock there is a
 large very old warehouse, it was once 
 derilict with no roof and infected    
 with rot and insects.  The building   
 was finished in 1831 and called       
 Wilberforce Warehouses but had not    
 been used since 1957.  In 1977 a local
 businessman, Francis Daly, negotiated 
 a long lease on the building  and set 
 about making the building weather-    
 tight.  Inside the complex the old    
 wood and brickwork has been retained  
 to give the place a rustic feel.      
 The first part of complex to open was 
 the nightclub and this financed the   
 development of the Waterfront Hotel,  
 the Roof Garden Restaurant and the    
 Cellar Bar.                           
 The complex has won many national and 
 international awards including the    
 Civic Trust Award and the Europa      
 Nostra award.                         </content>
