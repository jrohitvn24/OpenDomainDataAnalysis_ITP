 Holmes Chapel, a growing village,     
 began life round a church.  Today many
 new estates lie to the west of London 
 Road towards the M6 linking north and 
 south.  Expansion to the east is      
 restricted due to Jodrell Bank radio  
 telescope.  The growing community of  
 commuters in this area strains local  
 services.  Recent years have seen a   
 new shopping precinct, a health       
 centre, a library, a fire station, a  
 leisure complex/comprehensive school  
 and two primary schools.  There are   
 two established industries: Fisons    
 Pharmaceuticals and Fine Arts         
 wallpaper manufacturer.  Many people  
 travel out to work either by road or  
 rail.  Although rural land has been   
 developed there is still a significant
 farming community.  The River Dane    
 valley is used for country pursuits.  </content>
