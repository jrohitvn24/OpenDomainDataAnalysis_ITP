 dog which is a collie bitch.She eats  
 dog meat from a tin and lots of meaty 
 bones.Her favorite toy is a ball.She  
 knows the words," up,down,sit,bark    
 ball and fetch". She is good fun to   
 play with.                            
   I have a{Dutch rabbit}.She eats     
 oats,dandelions and green vegetables. 
 She lives in a hutch outside the      
 house.Some people keep{hamsters}and
