		<title>09Peening Quarter Farm</title>
		<content>  Peening Quarter Farm has 4 barns     
 altogether, the buildings are mainly  
 modern, of steel and asbestos         
 construction.  In winter their        
 bullocks are housed in the central    
 building with the hay stored on either
 side so that it can be thrown straight
 in to the bullocks without otherwise  
 having to move it. In summer they     
 clean the bullocks out.               
                                       
  Mr. Brown has 14 acres on the farm   
 but he rents more land all round      
 Wittersham.  The animals are kept     
 mainly for meat; there are 70         
 bullocks, 3 cows and 8 calves, the    
 cows are each given a name.   Mr.     
 Brown has 300 ewes and 4 rams which   
 are kept for wool and he employs 2    
 people on the farm.  There is one     
 field for corn and 2 ponds.
