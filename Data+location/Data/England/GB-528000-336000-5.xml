		<title>05Fenland Farming-Kirton Area</title>
		<content>    Hundreds of years ago the land in  
 this area was covered by water.  Most 
 of the farm land is only six feet     
 above sea level.  The land is well    
 drained into dykes which take the     
 water to the Wash.                    
    Farmers in this area grow a lot of 
 sugar beet.  Their other main crops   
 are wheat, peas, potatoes,            
 cauliflowers, cabbages, Brussel       
 sprouts, onions and barley.           
    Most jobs are done by machine but  
 hoeing, cutting cauliflowers and      
 picking daffodils are still done by   
 hand.  The number of farmworkers has  
 slowly decreased in the last twenty   
 years.  Farmers now use big machines  
 which save time and money.  The fields
 are large because then the farmers are
 not always turning round in their big 
 machines.                             
                                       </content>
