		<title>10The Carnival</title>
		<content>  The Carnival started over fifty years
 ago and used to raise money for the   
 local hospitals as there was no       
{National Health Service.}Nowadays the 
 money goes to many local{charities.  }
 This year one of the charities was for
 deaf children at a school in          
 Weddington. Equipment to help their   
 hearing was bought. The other aim was 
 for everyone to have{fun.}            
  The{Carnival Queen}is picked at a    
 dance in April. The Carnival consists 
 of a procession of floats and people  
 in fancy dress. Everyone carries a    
 bucket to collect money in. Marching  
 bands join in the procession which is 
 led by the{Mayor's car.}Each year the 
 Carnival has a theme, in 1985 it was  
{"The World of Make Believe."}The event
 is held on the first Saturday in June 
 and is followed by a gala on the      
 Sunday.                               </content>
