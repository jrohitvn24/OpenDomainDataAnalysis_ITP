		<content>The first factory in that area was a   
amunitions factory,near Green Ayre     
Station,which was built during the     
First World War.Afterwards a factory   
making Acetate Rayon was there.This    
became Lansil and in the 1960's when   
production was at it's height it       
employed 2,200 workers and covered over
thirty acres.However in 1982 the       
factory was closed.Lancaster City      
Council bought the derelict site with  
money from the Goverment's Derilict    
Land Grant,and began cleaning it up .  
There are still factories working in   
that area now,Standfast Dyers and      
Printers and Woodeaves plus small      
warehouse units,(Beehive Units-Barcleys
Bank)and the developments around them. 
In the future the Special Planning     
Group using money from the European    
Economic Community,who have already    
given &amp;150.000 for this development.   </content>
