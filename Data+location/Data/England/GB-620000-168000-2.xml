		<title>02Tourism in Reculver,</title>
		<content>Reculver is a quiet peaceful place     
surrounded by caravan parks and        
farmland.The sea is unfortunately      
polluted but you can risk going        
swimming in it.The beach is very muddy 
when the tide is out but there are some
patches of sand suitable for young     
children to build sandcastles.When the 
tide is in there is very little space  
because of the sea wall built to stop  
the sea eroding the land.If you are    
interested in walking there is plenty  
of countryside to walk around.There is 
place of interest called Reculver      
Towers owned by the Department of the  
Environment and open to the public for 
a small fee.Surrounding the towers is  
the remains of the Roman fort now      
mostly ruins.Many people visit these   
two attractions during the year.The    
caravan parks are the main tourist     
                                       </content>
