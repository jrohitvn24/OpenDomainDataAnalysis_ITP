		<title>03Education in Sawbridgeworth</title>
		<content> There are 3 schools in Sawbridgeworth 
 in our Domesday area.The{Fawbert and  
{Barnard School}is attended  by        
 children aged 5 to 7.For many years it
 served Sawbridgeworth as an all age   
 school.The Secondary School is called 
 the{Leventhorpe School}and was built  
 about 15 years ago.                   
 The{Reedings JMI School}was built 20  
 years ago and is still quite a modern 
 building.It stands in a quiet part of 
 the town away from the traffic.The    
 classes have large windows which make 
 the rooms very light.We don't have as 
 many books as we would like,but we    
 have a good library.The teachers all  
 have different interests and many run 
 clubs which we can join.Our games     
 field goes right down to the River    
 Stort and grass  surrounds the rest of
 the school.All the children get on    
 very well with each other.            </content>
