		<title>04RYDINGS IMPROVEMENT SCHEME</title>
		<content>  Keith Cropper,took us into a cabin   
 and showed us a map.He told us that a 
 crane would dig the silt and weed from
 Rydings Lodge to make it deeper.The   
 silt will be used to improve the farm 
 land.The crane can lift 25 tons of    
 silt.The public will be allowed to    
 walk in the area and to have picnics. 
  The MSC and the EEC have given over  
 half a million pounds for the project.
 They employ jobless people,most of    
 them are young men between 18 and 25. 
 They have a one year contract.If they 
 are under 18 they can return after 6  
 months,but those over 18 must wait    
 1year.The labourers get 46 pounds per 
 week,chargehands 65 pounds and skilled
 men eg. bricklayers 90 pounds after   
 tax and deductions.I would like to do 
 this job if I could not get another.  
 Really it is a shame that so many     
 people are unemployed.                </content>
