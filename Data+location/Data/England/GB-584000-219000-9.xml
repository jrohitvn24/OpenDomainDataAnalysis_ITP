		<content> Some of our class went out on to the  
{Kelvedon A12}bridge to do a traffic   
 survey.We counted the traffic passing 
 underneath us.There were lots of      
 lorries and cars(419 vehicles).We also
 went to {Church St.}The traffic was   
 very much lighter(only 9 vehicles). We
 took ten minutes in each count.Then we
 did the{High St.}There were quite a   
 lot of vehicles (68),but not as many  
 as the A12.This is because of the     
 ports in Harwich and Felixstowe which 
 the A12 leads to from London.
