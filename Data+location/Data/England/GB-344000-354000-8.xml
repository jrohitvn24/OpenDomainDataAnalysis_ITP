		<title>08Making Cheshire Cheese</title>
		<content> Fifty years ago we started work at 6am
 when the cows were handmilked by the  
 dim light of paraffin lamps.The milk  
 was kept warm with water heated in a  
 coal-fired boiler.The curds and whey  
 were stirred by hand using a wooden   
 rake.The curd was ready for hand      
 milling by 1pm and all the family     
 helped the farmers wife with this.    
   The cheese was then put into moulds 
 and carried to the cheese oven by the 
 kitchen fire grate.The utensils were  
 then scrubbed and scalded by 2pm.     
   At 3.30pm afternoon milking started 
 and the milk was poured into the vat  
 ready for the next day's cheese.      
   Before going to bed the farmer's    
 wife tightened the cheese presses and 
 checked that the cheese starter had   
 thickened ready for the next day.     
   One gallon of milk made 1 pound of  
 cheese.                               </content>
