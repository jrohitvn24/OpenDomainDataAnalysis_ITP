		<title>05CHRISTCHURCH CASTLE I</title>
		<content>{Twynham}castle was built sometime in  
 the twelfth century. It is located in 
{Christchurch.}In those days the town  
 was called{Twynham.}The castle was in 
 the town centre which was very small  
 it is between Castle Street and the   
 River Avon. It was built for the Lord 
 and his servants to protect themselves
 in an attack. Henry 1 gave Twynham to 
 his cousin{Baldwin de Redvers}in      
 around 1100. A large artificial mound 
 was made and a strong stone keep built
 on top of it. This was easy to defend 
 but it was made out of stone,  which  
 made it cold and uncomfortable. The   
 lower floor was for the servants. The 
 lords had no time because they were   
 busy elsewhere,So a{Constable}was     
 appointed to command the castle. That 
 is what the other ruin is opposite the
 castle, the{Constable's house.
