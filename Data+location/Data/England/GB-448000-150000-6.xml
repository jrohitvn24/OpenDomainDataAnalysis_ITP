		<content>{Portals Mill}                         
 Portal's Mill produces bank note paper
 from cotton waste. The paper is       
 exported to about 130 countries around
 the world; 80% ends up abroad. The    
 present mill was built in 1920. The   
 demand for bank note paper will       
 diminish because cheques and plastic  
 cards are used more and more. From 700
 to 750 workers are employed. Not all  
 the jobs are skilled. A shift work    
 system is operated and the average    
 worker does 37 and a half hours a     
 week. Salaries are quite good.        
 Employees have five weeks holiday a   
 year. The Queen's Award for           
 Industry has been won on two          
 occasions. These awards are given for 
 export drive and technological        
 innovation. The Mill is the largest   
 bank note paper mill in the world.
