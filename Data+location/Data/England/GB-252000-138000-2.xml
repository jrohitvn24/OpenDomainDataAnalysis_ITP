		<title>02MARWOOD N. HOUSING</title>
		<content>    There are only two villages in the 
 block,Milltown and Middle Marwood,each
 made up of about 25 houses,all very   
 individual and with a garden.Small    
 groups of houses (1_10) are dotted    
 about the area.                       
     Most of these houses are detached 
 dwellings.They are generally in a very
 good state of repair and although they
 may be very old most have modern      
 amenities.However many people still   
 have their own water supply and septic
 tank.Unless you have your own         
 cylinders there is no mains gas.Nearly
 every house uses its chimney and      
 although electricity and oil are used 
 for cooking wood burners and open     
 fires are used a great deal for       
 heating the home.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
