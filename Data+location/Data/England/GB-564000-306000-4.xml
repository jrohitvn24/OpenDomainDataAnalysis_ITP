		<title>04Shouldham-Children's pets.</title>
		<content>  Most families have pets of some      
 kind.The most popular ones are dogs   
 and cats.Some children have their own 
 pets to look after and from our sample
 these include gerbils,stick insects,  
 rabbits and hamsters.                 
  The larger pets, such as horses are  
 "shared",with some of the girls having
 riding lessons followed by caring for 
 the animals. Only one child has their 
 own pony, whilst one family has a     
 retired sea-side donkey.The children  
 who own rabbits have helped to make   
 their hutches and collect grass and   
 dandelion leaves to feed them.        
  Many of these pets come from local   
 pet shops and in Swaffham,on          
 Saturdays,there is a market which     
 deals with rabbits,goats and chickens.
