		<content> The area covered by the "D-Block"     
 denoted by G.R.03600588 is dominated  
 by coniferous trees planted by the    
 Forestry Commission. Steep sided      
 valleys with fast-flowing{burns}are   
 typical of the area. Dense forests    
 cover all but the steepest slopes,    
 apart from small areas alongside the  
 streams and one patch of rough grazing
 near{Akenshawburn Cottages.}There are 
 only two inhabited settlements,one at 
{The Forks}and the other at{           
{Akenshawburn.}                        
 These settlements are reached by rough
 forestry roads which have replaced the
 old pack-roads which used to          
 criss-cross the area.                 
 Deer,foxes,otters and adders are among
 the wild life to be found,whilst owls 
 and kestrels are examples of the      
 birdlife.
