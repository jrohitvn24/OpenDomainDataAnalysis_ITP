 Forthampton has a population of 150   
 people.  This is a decline from 100   
 years ago when the population was 237.
 A quarter of the people in the village
 are old age pensioners and only 6 are 
 children of school age.  Many people  
 in the village remember the time when 
 there were 20 or more school children 
 waiting for the bus each morning.     
 There are other indicators of a       
 changing population structure in the  
 village.  The church choir, the day   
 school and the Sunday school were all 
 once flourishing parts of the         
 community and are all now closed. Even
 the local youth club has almost closed
 due to lack of numbers.
