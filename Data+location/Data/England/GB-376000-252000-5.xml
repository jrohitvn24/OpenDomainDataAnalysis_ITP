      A small development of chalet    
 bungalows is currently being built on 
 the site of the old Rectory on the    
 south side of the Alfrick Road at     
 Bransford.  The Rectory, a large 17th 
 century listed timber frame building, 
 was demolished some twenty years ago  
 and the new Rectory was sited on the  
 Suckley Road.  At about the same time 
 a number of detached bungalows and    
 houses were built in its environs, as 
 well as sheltered accomodation for    
 pensioners.                           
                                       
      About fifty years ago a small    
 council housing development was built 
 on the Suckley Road, whereas most of  
 the other housing is privately owned.
