		<content> The area is dominated by the isolated 
 All Stains Church with its natural    
 churchyard and earth mounds of the    
 castle moat and deserted village.     
 There is some woodland but the area is
 mainly arable growing corn, sugar,    
 beat, field beans and rape with a few 
 cattle and pigs. The farms are mainly 
 family units but on the borders of the
 area are edges of larger units. The   
 fields are medium sized in the main   
 with few hedges. The population is    
 about one hundred. Of those working,  
 most work on the land with others     
 commuting to the local towns,         
 Haverhil, Saffron Walden and          
 Cambridge, or are self employed       
 working from home. There is an animal 
 rescue centre which is mainly for dogs
 and cats in block 5.
