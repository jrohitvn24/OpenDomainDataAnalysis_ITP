		<content>          {Social Survey (con)         
  Thirdly housewives.We found the most 
 people worked in Exeter but were      
 amazed that the second largest group  
 were those who worked either at home  
 or from home.Surprisingly just over   
 half the people belong to clubs in the
 village.The most popular club in      
 Kenton was found to be the Wives      
 Group.Of the parents who we asked     
 8% said they attend.Parents attend 31 
 differnt clubs and societies.Exeter is
 the most popular shopping center not  
 surprisingly because it is quite near 
 to Kenton about 15 minutes drive and  
 it's one of the best shopping  centres
 in Devon.We were surprised that       
 Exmouth,Teignmouth and Chudleigh would
 even be on the places where parents   
 shop.Interestingly parents watched    
 more sports T.V programmes than any   
 other type followed by the news.      </content>
