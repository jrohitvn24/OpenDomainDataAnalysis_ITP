		<title>07The Canal At Tring</title>
		<content>    The first survey of the route for a
 new canal was undertaken by  James    
 Barnes and it was resurveyed by       
 William Jessop in 1772.By December    
 1773  3,000 men were at work.The      
 canal could take barges carrying      
 70tons.The lock dimensions allowed a  
 pair of narrow boats to go through at 
 once.The most difficult engineering   
 was crossing the high ground at the   
 summit near Tring.                    
    At Tring a cutting was made        
 through the Chiltern Hills one and a  
 half miles long and 30feet deep.It was
 completed in 1797 also  Wendover Arm  
 which fed water to the summit.The     
 stretch from the summit south of      
 Berkhamsted was opened in 1799,and    
 the stretch north of Fenny Stratford  
 was opened in May 1800.Nowadays the   
 canal is used  by boatmen,fishermen   
 and for walks along the towpaths.     </content>
