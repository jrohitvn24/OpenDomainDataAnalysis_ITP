		<title>14GRAND SUMMER FAIR</title>
		<content> A{Grand Summer Fair}was held at{Green 
{Dragon School}on 22nd June. It was set
 up by the Parent-Teacher Association  
 and was sponsored by Agfa-Gevaert (a  
 local firm).                          
 We tried most things. The adults liked
 the{Tombola}and{White Elephant}stalls 
 best. We had mixed feelings about the 
{Inflatable Green Dragon}- too dear,   
 older boys pushing younger ones off - 
 and it was slippery from the rain so  
 our clothes got dirty, but it was a   
 lot of fun. The{Fancy Dress}was good, 
 but the judges seemed to be a little  
 confused. Mickey Mouse won. No police 
 horses or dogs - a car came instead.  
 No{Face Painting}- we had looked      
 forward to that! Over 500 people came 
 and the school made over Â£800. The    
 money will be used on visits for the  
 children and to buy an extra computer.
{The Fair was great fun.               </content>
