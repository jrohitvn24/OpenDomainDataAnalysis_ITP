 These mainly take the form of coastal 
 defence, or coastal development. There
 has been a twenty year saga a Beesands
 involving the presence of a large     
 caravan site on the proposed site of  
 the village green. A large number of  
 local residents in the area wish to   
 see the land put to use as a money    
 obtaining area (the caravan park)     
 while the rest would rather it be put 
 to use as a village green. An argument
 for the caravan site is to create     
 employment for the younger unemployed 
 local residents who would otherwise   
 have to travel further afield to gain 
 employment. The main argument for the 
 village green is that it will enhance 
 the visual aspect of the village      
 therefore attracting many more day    
 trippers who tend to spend more than  
 the residents and caravaners.         </content>
