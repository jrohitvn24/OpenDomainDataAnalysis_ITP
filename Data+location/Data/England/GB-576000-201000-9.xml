 The cemetary lies approximately 250   
 metres north of the leprosy hospital{ 
{Hospital &amp; Homes of St. Giles.}The    
 cemetary is small and is entered by   
 passing under a porch.  Once inside   
 you see a statue of Jesus in front of 
 an old chapel where funerals used to  
 be held (this is no longer in use).   
 The cemetary is divided into two      
 parts; one part is for the 38 lepers  
 who have died, and the other part is  
 for the 31 nuns who looked after them.
  Behind each grave is a small cross   
 made of stone.  There are 9 leprosy   
 patients left in the hospital; the    
 oldest patient is 89 and one person   
 has been there for 30 years.  Leprosy 
 is a very rare disease in Britain, but
 it is still common in third world     
 countries.                            </content>
