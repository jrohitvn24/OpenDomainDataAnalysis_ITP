		<title>13FARMING IN CHAPEL-FRITH.</title>
		<content> The old farm has been in the family   
 for 95 years. It comprises ll0 acres  
 of various soils,some of which are    
 difficult to drain.Organic &amp; chemical 
 fertilisers are used &amp; rainfall       
 favours grass-growing for the dairy   
 farmer.40 Fresians produce l70 gallons
 per day.E.E.C.quotas entail a 9% cut- 
 back.Cattle are reared on the farms.  
 The farmer works by himself using     
 machinery but needs extra help at     
 harvest time.Work begins at 0530 and  
 finishes at l930.A balance between    
 conservation &amp; production is          
 maintained by planting trees &amp;        
 hawthorn hedges. Major changes include
 oil lamps to electricity &amp; horse power
 to machinery. The future plans of this
 successful farm are to provide holiday
 accommodation &amp; increase sheep stock  
 whilst decreasing cattle.
