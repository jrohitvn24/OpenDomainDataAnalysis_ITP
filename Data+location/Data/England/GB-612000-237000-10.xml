    This area no longer has a "village 
Bobby".Fifteen years ago the local     
Wherstead Police Station was sold.     
    Now P.C.Hodson and P.C Brunning    
are  the two policemen who cover the   
Holbrook,Shotley,Freston ,Bentley,     
Wherstead,Tattingstone and             
Chelmondiston area. They are based at  
Holbrook.They patrol in rural beat     
vans. The main rural crimes are        
shoplifting,burglary,poaching and      
cattle rustling.This area is part of   
the Ipswich Division which has a       
burglary rate of about 50-60 a week    
although the area we are studying has  
no serious crime problem.The only      
serious crime in the last 10 years was 
the "Suitcase Murder."A body was       
chopped up and found in a suitcase in  
Tattingstone.The crime was not solved. 
P.C.Reeve is the School Liason Officer.</content>
