 is a{farming business co-operative.}It
 originated on a greenfield site, built
 with the aid of E.E.C. and government 
 grants. During its development there  
 were problems with planning           
 permission; these were overcome as it 
 is an agricultural business and this

 reason for this positioning was to

 employs forty people, with two        
 employees housed on site.
