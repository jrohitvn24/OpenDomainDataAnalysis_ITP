		<title>12LIFE AT A VILLAGE SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> My name is{Helen Cornish}and I am 11  
 years old. My alarm went off at 7:30  
 today because I'm going to school.I   
 listen to my radio until 7:50 then I  
 get up and put on my school uniform , 
 which is a grey skirt, a white blouse 
 and a tie which is red and grey.Then  
 I have to make my packed lunch which  
 consists of two sandwiches,a packet of
 crisps and an orange.As I walk up to  
 my friend (Julies) house,who walks to 
 school with me,I pass the post office 
 where I post my mums letters. When I  
 reach school I hang up my coat and bag
 and put my lunch in a big box with    
 everyone elses. We lead into our      
 classes after our bell rings and we   
 line up. In class Mr Frampton takes   
 the register to see how many children 
 are at class 4 today. At school we do 
 maths and English,and topic themes    
 such as people,transport or farming.  </content>
