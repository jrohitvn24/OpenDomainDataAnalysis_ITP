		<title>17A Diabetic Girl - My Day</title>
		<content>I am an 11 year old girl who has had   
diabetes for 10 months.At 7.15am I go  
downstairs and do a blood or a urine   
test for sugar.My bloodsugar should be 
4.4-6.7 but if it is below 4.4 I am    
hypo.This means not enough sugar is in 
my blood and I feel unwell.Above 13.3  
is hyper, this is too much sugar in    
the blood and needs treatment.  At 7.30
am I have my injection [Human Montard  
U 100 Insulin]. At the moment I am on  
14 units.[June 1985]  At 8.00am I have 
breakfast a normal size bowl of cereal.
At school I keep an emergency kit which
contains a small lucazade, some glucose
tablets and biscuits,these are in case 
I have a hypo. At 10.30 I have a packet
of crisps and then nothing until 12.00 
when I have sandwiches, yogurt and an  
apple.  AT 5.00 I have my main meal. At
bedtime I do a test and have some      
cereal.                                </content>
