		<title>15A Day in the Life of Paul</title>
		<content>   In the morning,I wake up at 7.00. We
 get dressed and go downstairs. At 8.00
 I have Frosties for breakfast. At 8.40
 we leave to walk to school, then we   
 have some playtime before school      
 starts. At 9.00 the whistle goes twice
 then we come in and read until        
 assembly time. We do S.M.P.maths until
 break when we play 'Space Invaders'.  
 You play it like this- somebody throws
 a ball against a wall so that it      
 rebounds  and hits someone else. Who- 
 ever they hit has to do the same.     
 After break,we have our Topic lesson, 
 then we have lunch. I have sandwiches 
 and crisps. Next there is more play-  
 time. After lunch,we see a television 
 programme called 'WATCH' and have a   
 story read to us. When the buzzer goes
 we get our coats and walk home. I ride
 my bike until tea and then I build my 
 'Lego' spaceship. I go to sleep at 8pm</content>
