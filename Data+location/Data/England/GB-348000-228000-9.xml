		<content> Home Life - Every day I watch t.v. and
 if there are programes I am  going to 
 miss, if I am going out to tea we put 
 it on the video.In the evening I      
 listen to the stereo and sometimes    
 play on the computer ,sometimes I play
 with my electronic games.             
 Some of us have dishwashers, so that  
 we don't have to wash up, other       
 domestic appliances are washing       
 machines, vacuum cleaners, microwave  
 ovens, sandwich makers. Some          
 telephones are now portable and you   
 can have one in your car if you are   
 rich. Some of the food we eat is      
 already prepared and only needs       
 heating before eating, these are kept 
 in the freezer. There are also instant
 foods such as mashed potato,deserts   
 and toppings. We also like fried foods
 a lot.
