The lowest point of the area is 140    
metres and the highest 384 metres.     
A dominant feature of the area is      
Bromlow Callow, a clump of Scots Pine  
and European Larch trees established in
Victorian times. Earlier this century a
large area of Bromlow Hill was wooded, 
this was then greatly reduced and the  
remaining trees became a striking      
feature of the landscape, visible for  
miles.It stands 1,000 feet above sea   
level and 800 feet above the           
surrounding countryside in lonely and  
vulnerable isolation.                  
The A488 road along the Hope Valley,a  
deep wooded gorge, rises 600 feet in a 
few miles and is one of Shropshires    
most noted beauty spots.Hope Church    
standing at 777 feet.There is          
considerable geological interest, the  
Pontesford-Linley fault being evident. </content>
