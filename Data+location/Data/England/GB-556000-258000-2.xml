		<title>02GEOGRAPHY OF THE FEN EDGE</title>
		<content>    The area covered forms part of the 
 Fen Edge between the East Anglian     
 Heights and the southern edge of the  
 Cambridgeshire Fens.                  
    The underlying soil is chalk with  
 some glacial gravels in the south-east
    The region has been formed into    
 gently rounded hills which dip from 61
 metres in the south-east to 15 metres 
 in the north-west.                    
    There is only one waterway - a     
 small stream which  rises from a      
 spring at Spring Hall and flows       
 north-west for five miles to join the 
 River Cam.                            
    There is a windmill in the         
 south-east - a feature typical of this
 area.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
