		<content> Longwick Mill dates back to the l7th  
 Century and stands on the stream      
 between Longwick and Princes          
 Risborough.  When the railway was     
 built the high embankment carrying it 
 cut the mill pond in two.  Nowadays   
 modern machinery works the mill       
 grinding animal foodstuffs.  It is a  
 family business employing three       
 generations.  The owners sell to      
 customers from the forecourt and also 
 have a delivery business.  Some local 
 crops as well as North American maize 
 and fish meal and soya meal are       
 ground.                               
 North Mill,  right at the lower west  
 edge of the area, used to be a timber 
 mill but now is the home of a small   
 construction company specialising in  
 the erection of street lighting.      
 There is still a timber yard nearby   
 next to the mill stream.              </content>
