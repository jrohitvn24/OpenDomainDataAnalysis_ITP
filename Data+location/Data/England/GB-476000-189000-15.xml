		<content>  Founded in 1879, The Community of St.
 atherine of Alexandria is an Anglican 
Augustinian order whose aims are for   
the increase of Religion and care for  
the needy.                             
  Originally sited in London, bombed   
out by the Flying Bomb blitz in 1944,  
and after temporary premises in the    
provinces moved to Parmoor (home of    
the Cripps Family) in 1947.            
  The Revd. Mother, with four nuns,    
presides over a household of twenty    
five people. The sisters, a nurse      
and gardener, assisted by voluntary    
workers, care for elderly ladies,      
each of whom have a room of their own. 
  The work of the Community is funded  
by investments and donations. Twice a  
year bazaars are held to augment funds 
and are well patronised by local       
people and friends of the household    
who travel from far afield.            </content>
