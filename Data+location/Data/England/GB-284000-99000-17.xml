		<content> When the water comes in to the works  
 its all mercky and green. It then goes
 through two lots of metal bars collect
 to the rags and bits of paper.Then the
 water goes into two big mixing tanks  
 where all the grit and similar little 
 things are removed. When that is over 
 the water goes into a pipe and gets   
 sprayed into a filter pit where it is 
 strained.I then goes into the river.  
 When they clean out the pipe that     
 comes from the filter pit they        
 sometimes find eels about two feet    
 long. There are two people that look  
 after the works and there are about 5 
 people that go in and out. The        
 deepest tank is thirty-two feet deep.
