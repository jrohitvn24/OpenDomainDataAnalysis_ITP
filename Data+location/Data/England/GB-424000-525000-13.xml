		<title>13THE SCHOOL NURSE.</title>
		<content> When we are at school, the nurse comes
 to visit us. She tests our eyes and   
 looks at our teeth. She does not      
 always do these things because she    
 sometimes looks in our hair to see if 
 there are any lice or nits in it. If  
 there are she contacts our parents and
 gives them some ointment to wash our  
 hair with. She told us she does not   
 really like looking in our hair but   
 she has to! She sometimes comes to    
 test our hearing as well. Our school  
 nurse does not only examine us. She   
 tells us what to eat to keep healthy. 
 She tells us to serve food, not germs.
 The school nurse helps those who have 
 problems to cope with their illness in
 school. These children might have     
 diabetes or asthma or something like  
 that. She brings us posters to remind 
 us what to do to stay fit and healthy.
 Our school nurse is very nice.        </content>
