		<title>04Out of school clothes</title>
		<content>When we get home from School we put on 
totally different clothes.When I get   
home from School,I change into Jeans   
and a tee-shirt, or sweat-shirt and    
trainers.We take off our uniform,      
because we like to keep it clean for   
the next day.If we go out we usually   
wear a jump-suit and flat soft         
shoes.For week days my mum usually     
wears a skirt and jacket or a split    
skirt and mint tee-shirt.For Church I  
usually wear a jump-suit or a white and
pink skirt and a white jacket.After    
School,boys usually wear jeans trainers
denim jackets and a tee-shirt.When they
play on their B.M.X's they put on B.M.X
gear which is a B.M.X tracksuit and    
pads for protection.
