		<title>05 A day in the life of Jacqui</title>
		<content> I get up at 8.00a.m. and get washed   
and dressed. I have my breakfast and go
to school. We start school at 9.00a.m. 
Our teacher allows us to sit any where 
we like. In my class there are 20      
children whose ages range from 7 to 11.
When we come in first thing in the     
morning we have to do the work on the  
black-board. Our morning play is at    
10.30a.m. We have packed lunches, or   
you can go home. My class teacher is   
also the Headteacher, but on Tuesdays  
and Fridays we are taken by Mrs.       
Wilmot.We finish school at 4.00p.m. and
then I walk home. I get changed and go 
out to play until I have my tea at     
about half past six. After tea I will  
watch television until it is time to   
get ready for bed. I goto bed at       
9.15p.m.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
