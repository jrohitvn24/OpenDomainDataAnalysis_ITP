 My mum gets up at about 7:30.she      
makes her bed ,cleans out the fire and 
at about 8:00 she gets me ready for    
school.I get washed and dressed by     
8:10.Then  I have a quick breakfast    
which my mum makes.At 8:20 I clean my  
teeth while my mum washes up.At 8:25 I 
set off for school,on the way my       
friend meets me.While I am at          
school,mum gets dressed ,cleans        
up,knits,makes her lunch and cleans    
out the budgie.At school I have        
lessons until 10:15,then it is         
break.School continues until           
12:10.Lunch break continues until      
13:25.School continues until 15:35.    
When I return home,at about 15:45 I    
get changed and do my homework(if I    
have any).I have my tea which is       
usually about 17:30 which is usually   
something with chipped potatoes.       </content>
