		<content> For many years Marson Moretaine has   
 suffered a heavy increase in road     
 traffic.This has risen considerably   
 since the opening of the M1           
 motorway.East from the motorway are   
 routes to Bedford and East Anglia and 
 the east coast ports of Harwich and   
 Felixstowe.                           
 The inhabitants have pressed for many 
 years for a diversion around their    
 village.The County Council has decided
 to build a By-Pass around the northern
 side of the village,scheduled to start
 January 1986.This choice of route is  
 questioned by the locals who would see
 a southern route as having less       
 divisive impact on the community than 
 the northern route which will sever   
 Upper and Lower Shelton from Marston  
 and bisect Moat Farm necessitating    
 farm machinery to use the road through
 the village.                          </content>
