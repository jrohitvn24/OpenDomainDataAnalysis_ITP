		<content>    The Holymoorside and District      
 Historical Society is one example of a
 successful{village society.} Founded  
 in 1973, the society{aims}to study the
 history of the local area and maintain
 the history of the present.           
                                       
    The society has an{open membership 
 and their meetings often enjoy an     
 audience of 40 to 50. Meetings are    
 held in the{Village Hall}once a month 
 from September to June.  The meetings 
 usually involve a talk by a speaker   
 followed by a time for questions. Very
 often the meeting adjourns to the{Bull
{Inn}in the village.                   
                                       
    In June the society has an annual  
 visit. In 1985 there was a visit to   
 the{Kilham Island Industrial Museum   
 in Sheffield.
