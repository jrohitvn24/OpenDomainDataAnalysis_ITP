		<content> Although many of the clubs already    
 mentioned have visitors from outside  
 of Brightlingsea, the involvement of  
 people from outside the community in  
 the water based leisure activities is 
 of a different nature.                
 During the warmer months there is an  
 influx of enthusiasts wishing to avail
 themselves of the relatively safe     
 waters that surround us.              
 Generally speaking Motorboating       
 enthusiasts tend to operate as        
 individuals, mainly using their craft 
 for fishing.                          
 Sailors in the main make use of either
 the Yacht Club or the Sailing Club for
 support in their cruising racing or   
 board sailing these two clubs have    
 between them been responsible for the 
 spawning of many National, European   
 and World Champions as well as an     
 Olympic Gold Medalist.                </content>
