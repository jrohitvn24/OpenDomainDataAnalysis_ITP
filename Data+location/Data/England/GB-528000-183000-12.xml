street market. There's lots of stalls  
and peoples crafts. You can buy lots   
and lots of different things. On stalls
there are antiques as well as new      
things so whatever your taste you're   
bound to find it there. There's also   
lots of different tapes and records.   
There's actors and live music shows and
puppet shows as well! In short There's 
everything. It's really brilliant!!!   
It's quite big and you can spend a     
whole day there. You can also get food 
there it's usually bigger and better at
the weekends it's also buisier then.   
You can get water bus rides there to   
the zoo to see all the animals or to   
little Venice. You can also see a play 
ohe water busses or you can eat on
