		<title>08CHURCHES OF CROFT.</title>
		<content>   The Parish Church of St. Peter at   
 Croft may date back to Saxon times,   
 and a monument to Lewis Carroll can be
 seen in the church, as his father was 
 Rector of Croft in the 1840s.         
   There are about 15 communicants at  
 the 8 a.m. service on the first 3     
 Sundays of the month, while Holy      
 Communion is held at 11 a.m.on the 4th
 Sunday,with about 25 communicants.A   
 Family Service is held at 11 a.m. on  
 the 2nd. Sunday, with Matins at 11a.m.
 on the 1st. &amp; 3rd. Sundays. The Priest
 in Charge lives in Middleton Tyas.    
   Croft Methodist Church is situated  
 in Hurworth Place and dates from 1870.
 Sadly the membership now is only 25,  
 although many people have worked over 
 the years to maintain it. A weekly    
 Guild is held on Tuesdays,and there is
 a Coffee Afternoon each month. The    
 Minister lives in Darlington.         </content>
