		<title>09Chertsey Abbey, Abbey Fields</title>
		<content> Abbey Fields were once the gardens of 
 Chertsey Abbey, but now they are used 
 for football, dog walking and a       
 children's playground. Every year,    
 Black Cherry Fair takes place on the  
 Fields during July, and includes      
 stalls, arcades, displays and         
 competitions. Also on this site is    
 Abbey House, which is now run as a Day
 Centre for the elderly of the Chertsey
 area.                                 
 There are 2 fish ponds still to be    
 found on the Fields - these are the   
 remnants of the original 7 such ponds.
 The Abbey ruins are hardly visible,   
 the stones being taken away at the    
 time of the Dissolution of the        
 monastries. Abbey Barn is used for    
 children's theatre, and Abbey Farm is 
 now an animal sanctuary - one         
 'resident' is a three-legged goat.
