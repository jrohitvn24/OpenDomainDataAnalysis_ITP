		<title>05ARMLEY FESTIVAL- W.LEEDS</title>
		<content> The first Armley Festival was in 1977 
 and is now held every two years. The  
 Festival is in two parts. In July the 
 local schools have a gala in          
 St.Bartholmew's Church (held there    
 because it is one of the biggest      
 buildings in Armley). Another event in
 July is the playing and marching of   
 the massed bands. In September there  
 is a carnival which takes place at Ley
 Lane Recreation Ground on Saturday and
 Sunday. It begins with a procession   
 through the streets of Armley with    
 bands, decorated floats and children  
 in fancy dress. There are stalls and  
 amusements for all the family. Sunday 
 is Sports Day with races and games for
 the children. Armley Festival is a    
 time for people to meet together, have
 fun and enjoy themselves.
