		<content>   All the children living within the  
 survey area attend either primary     
 schools in{Normanton}or{Sutton,}or    
 secondary education in the larger     
 towns. Some children are able to walk 
 to school if they live in these       
 villages, others travel by bicycle, by
 private car or by school buses.       
   Normanton has 3 buildings which are 
 or have been the village school. The  
 first was built in the early 19th.    
 century for 10 poor children from the 
 village. It is now a private house.   
 Then came a larger building behind the
 original, to educate 90 children. This
 building is now the village hall. The 
 new primary school is just outside the
 survey area, and the average school   
 roll is 35, with 2 full-time staff.   
   The old{Weston}village school and   
 schoolhouse are now the village hall. 
 Weston does not have a village school.</content>
