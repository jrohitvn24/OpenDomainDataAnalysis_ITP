		<title>20JACK CLEMO: POET</title>
		<content> Jack Clemo, the son of a poor clay    
 worker, is deaf and blind. He lives   
 near Carthew. Despite great handicaps 
 he surpassed any doubts that he might 
 be condemned to a life incapable of   
 self-expression; against all odds,    
 Jack Clemo became a renowned writer.  
                                       
 If you wish to get a feeling of what  
 it is like to live in an area         
 dominated by Chia Clay, read his      
 poetry. It is simple and full of      
 colloquial charm. For example, in the 
 "Echoing Tip" he describes how china  
 clay "like cold sloppy lava" burst    
 through a dam causing "nearby         
 cottagers...to scurry from rooms and  
 gardens before the thick wave lopped  
 over doorsteps and spoilt the pattern 
 of canvas, carpets and easy routine." 
                                       
                                       </content>
