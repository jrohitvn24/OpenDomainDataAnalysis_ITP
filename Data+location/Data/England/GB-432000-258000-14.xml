		<title>14CHESTERTON-LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content> The village of Chesterton and the     
 surrounding area is patrolled under   
 the official police duties of Gaydon  
 Police House.However there is also    
 cover from Harbury Police Station.On  
 the occasions when Chesterton Windmill
 is open to the public for viewing and 
 fundraising,the police line the       
 approach roads with no waiting signs  
 to avoid conjestion.Over the years,   
 several of the main roads near the    
 village have been slightly re-routed  
 in order to eliminate dangerous bends 
 and to ensure maximum safety for      
 traffic and pedestrians.The now       
 derelict Mill House,was used in the   
 late seventeenth century as the       
 Magistrates Courts for the Petty      
 Sessional Division of Kingston and    
 Chesterton,and the local landowner was
 the Justice of the Peace.
