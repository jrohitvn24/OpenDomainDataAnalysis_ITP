		<content>   The land in and around Binstead     
 formed part of{Squire Fleming's estate
 but most has now been sold as freehold
 to householders and farmers.          
   Before World War I the houses were  
 mainly built of stone and the village 
 consisted of Arnold Road, Chapel Road 
 and Cemetery Road.                    
   The original{bakery}was established 
 in 1871 and the Institute was used as 
 council chambers until the            
 amalgamation with Ryde Council.       
   The{old forge}is now a hairdressing 
 salon and Binstead garage is built on 
 the site of a smallholding.           
   The land of{Binstead Lodge Farm}is  
 now a housing estate and riding       
 stables and an equestrian centre are  
 built on the site of the{old          
{brickfields.}The population of        
 Binstead is now about                 
 2000 people.                          </content>
