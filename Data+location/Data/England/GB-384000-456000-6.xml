		<title>06The Hellifield Auction Mart</title>
		<content>    This is one of the oldest business 
 concerns in Hellifield. There is one  
 main Sale Day, held on Thursday each  
 week.                                 
    Sheep, cows and bulls are          
 transported here in wagons by road, to
 be sold in the auction ring to        
 butchers or their agents, after first 
 being passed by a government          
 inspector.                            
    The Auction Staff includes the     
 auctioneer and his assistant, and     
 clerks who deal with bills etc.       
 Outside workers drive the animals     
 first onto the weighing machines, and 
 after the sale into pens to await     
 transportation to their new owners.   
    On busy days 2,000 to 3,000 sheep  
 are brought to the auction, and 300 to
 400 cattle from as far away as Kendal 
 and Halifax. An average price for a   
 sheep is Â£35, for cattle Â£450 each.   </content>
