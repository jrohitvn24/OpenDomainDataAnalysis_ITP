		<title>16THE INNKEEPER, WEST BURTON</title>
		<content> We interviewed Jean and Jim at our    
 local pub, Fox &amp; Hounds. It is a Free 
 House with a good cellar and a        
 refrigeration plant recently          
 installed. Jean cooks meals for bar   
 snacks and for the dining room. She   
 has a few local ladies to help. The   
 most popular meal is her home-made    
 meat and potato pie. They do not sell 
 spirits to many people but they sell a
 lot of beer and lager. Orange is the  
 most popular soft drink. Summer is the
 busiest time of year when many        
 visitors come for meals and for       
 drinks after walking. The inn opens   
 from 11 am to 3 pm and 6 pm to 10.30  
 pm. In summer and at weekends they are
 allowed to stay open unti 11 pm. The  
 laws are strict about opening hours   
 but they may change. Jean and Jim can 
 accommodate 4 people for bed and      
 breakfast.                            </content>
