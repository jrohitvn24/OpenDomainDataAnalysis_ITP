		<content>   The majority of{housing}is{owner-   
{occupied,}although some is Council-   
 owned. Some houses are fairly modern  
 but most are 50 years old or more,    
 many having been modernised.          
   Some{historic buildings}such as     
 Morley's, Shiprods, Ewhurst Manor and 
 several Sussex barns, date back to the
 15th century, and others such as      
 Chestham, Shermanbury Place and       
 Shermanbury Church are also of        
 interest. The residential character of
 housing is rapidly changing; with the 
 increase in size of farms and reduced 
 labour force, many farm houses and    
 cottages have been sold as non-       
 agricultural residences.              
   Wymarks has been converted to an    
{Old People's Home}and Shermanbury     
 Grange is a special school for 12 to  
 16 year olds run by West Sussex County
 Council.                              </content>
