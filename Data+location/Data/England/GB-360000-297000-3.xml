		<content> Looking back to my first day at school
 I remember I was a little nervous, but
 I didn't cry. I enjoyed my first day  
 at school very much and I made several
 new friends. The maths were cards that
 we copied off. I can remember being   
 very proud when I got onto reading    
 book 5b. One of the sad things in my  
 time at school was when one of my     
 teachers left school. Each year I was 
 a little scared of moving up into a   
 higher class, but when I got into that
 class it was nowhere near as bad as   
 I thought it would be.                
 I have learnt a lot in these last     
 six years. I hope to do well at the   
 William Brookes Comprehensive School, 
 and get a good job. Now all I have are
 a few more weeks and then my years in 
 primary school will be over.
