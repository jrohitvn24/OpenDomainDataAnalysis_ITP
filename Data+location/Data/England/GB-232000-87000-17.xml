		<title>17NETHERBRIDGE</title>
		<content> The original bridge,pre 1504,which is 
 no longer in evidence, except as a    
 ford, was replaced by {New Bridge}for 
 which funds were raised by Bshp.Oldham
 in 1504.New Bridge is South of the    
 junction between the Tamar &amp; the      
 Ottery and has been known as{Higher   
{New Bridge}when compared with the New 
 Bridge over the Tamar at Gunnislake.  
 The name{Netherbridge}possibly re-    
 placed {H.N.Bridge}when Netherbridge  
 Farm was rebuilt.Plans for the present
 bridge were proposed in 1925,but lack 
 of money and subsequent war prevented 
 work and plans were shelved until now.
 There are twenty men on site,employed 
 for a contract period of thirty five  
 weeks. They expect to finish work on  
 the bridge after a period of twenty   
 five weeks and the estimated cost is  
 in the region of Â£500,000.
