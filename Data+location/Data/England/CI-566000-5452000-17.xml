		<title>17St. Martin's Church 1.</title>
		<content>   St. Martin's church is over l,OOO   
 years old.  The church was already    
 standing in lO42 according to old     
 records. The governor used to live in 
 the Parish of St. Martin which is why 
 it was considered the leading church  
 in the Island. The architecture of the
 church shows that it was built in     
 several stages. Half of the south wall
 is rough boulders and the other half  
 is quarried stone and the two halves  
 of the roof are slightly different in 
 height. The church has grown from a   
 tiny chapel to what it is today. First
 a nave was added to the chancel, then 
 about a century later, a south aisle. 
 The spire was not built until l582. It
 was struck  by lightning and          
 shattered in l6l6 and again in l837.  
 Later it was rebuilt with a           
 lightning conductor.
