		<content>Girls,about the age of 11 like to play 
'Stop' or '40,40'. They also play chase
games with the boys. Skipping and 'Keep
the kettle boiling' are playground     
activities along with 'Spin around'.   
'Tally Ho' is played by everybody. You 
have to run from one end of the play   
ground to the other while avoiding the 
catchers. They have to catch you and   
say "Tally ho 1,2,3" before you become 
a catcher. Playing with conkers on     
string is popular as is using a long   
piece of elastic in a loop. Two people 
stand inside the elastic and stretch it
around their ankles. Others  jump in   
and out of the elastic trying to copy  
each other.
