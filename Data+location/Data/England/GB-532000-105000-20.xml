		<title>20CHILDREN'S STREET GAMES</title>
		<content>  BY: Tanya,Kerrie &amp; Joanne            
   The street games we like playing are
{Double Dutch, Bulldog, 44 Save All,   
{Tennis, Stooll Ball, Football, Wall   
{Ball, Red Rover and Postmans Knock.   
{Double Dutch}is skipping with two     
 ropes.{Bulldog}is a simple game of    
 running and catching.{44 Save All}is  
 like hide and seek, but you have to   
 get to the post before the other      
 person sees you.{Stoolball}is like    
 cricket with a white square wicket.   
{Wall Ball}is like football but you    
 have to kick a ball against a wall.   
{  Red Rover}is a game with two teams  
 they stand opposite each other and    
 then call a person over.If the person 
 can't break between their two arms,   
 they are on their side.{Postmans Knock
 is knocking on peoples' doors and     
 running away before they  open it and 
 catch you.                            </content>
