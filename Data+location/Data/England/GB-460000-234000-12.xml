 are unlikely to have lived in the area
 for long.Little of interest happens in
 such backwaters.What makes them       
 interesting to us youngsters is the   
 fact that they have lived long enough 
 to have memories of times that have   
 gone forever.                         
  The oldest inhabitant is Mrs.Beale   
 who was born in 1886.She lives with   
 her sister 10 years younger in the    
 house their father Ernest Collin      
 (1858-1952)had while he was head      
 miller.Like most girls who left school
 at 14 she went into service returning 
 in 1915 when her mother died.After    
 marriage to a local farmworker she    
 came home to Westbury when her husband
 died.Alice Collin her sister worked as
 a dressmaker in Brackley from 8am to
