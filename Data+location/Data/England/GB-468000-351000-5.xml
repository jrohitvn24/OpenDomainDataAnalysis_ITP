		<content> I dragged myself out of bed.It was a  
 horrible wet morning,my bed was in a  
 mess.Mum and Dad were downstairs      
 already. Mum had just finished her    
 toast.Dad was starting his grapefruit.
 I sat down in my chair,put my         
 serviette on my lap,and started my    
 grapefruit.After breakfast we got     
 dressed.Then we went to church.I have 
 been going to the Minster for about 9 
 or 10 years.When we got back I dusted 
 my bedroom,then went out to play with 
 my friend Kirsty.At 1-30pm I had my   
 lunch.We had beef,roast potatoes,     
 yorkshire puddings and Dads own       
 cabbage.(This is grown on his         
 allotment.) Then I went out to play   
 again.We played 999,British Bulldogs  
 and three bad eggs.At 6-30pm we had   
 tea,Ihad a piece of cake,a chocolate  
 biscuit and three pieces of bread.I   
 washed my hair and got ready for bed. </content>
