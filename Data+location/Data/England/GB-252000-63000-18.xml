		<title>18Transport in Shaugh Prior.</title>
		<content>  In our area there are very few means 
 of transport. One kind of transport is
 the {Bus Service}.Most of the children
 travel to school on the bus.We get on 
 the bus at a small village called{    
{Wotter},the bus comes at 9.25am and we
 get to school at 9.30am.We go home on 
 the half past three bus.Other means of
 transport are cars,motorbikes, or     
 bicycles.Sometimes children ride their
 bicycles to school,it saves bus fares 
 and it is good fun. Two children used 
 to ride a horse to school.At the      
 moment the bus fare to go from Wotter 
 to Shaugh Prior is 20pence.Many {     
{lorries from the English China Clay   
{Works}travel through Shaugh           
 Prior.Sometimes our school goes on    
 coach trips,a coach is a much more    
 comfortable way of travelling.
