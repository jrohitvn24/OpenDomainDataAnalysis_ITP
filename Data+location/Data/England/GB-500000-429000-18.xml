		<content>  As we biked down the twisting road we
 glanced at the scenery.We travelled   
 slowly to take in the view.All we     
 could see were a few empty grassy     
 fields and many fields of barley      
 drifting in the wind.                 
   We got off our bikes and climbed    
 up the steep slope of a disused       
 railway embankment, destroying the    
 silence with our groans.Walking among 
 the tangled mass of brambles and      
 brooms it was hard to believe that 20 
 years before trains had sped this way 
 carrying coal from Barnsley to Hull.  
   At one part the embankment had been 
 nibbled away apparently by farmers    
 eager for an easy supply of chalk     
 suitable for mending tracks .We ran   
 down the slope to the road, the smell 
 of silage lost among petrol fumes.
