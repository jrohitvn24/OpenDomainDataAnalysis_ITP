   Unlike the other Parishes,Torteval  
 and Forest have relatively little     
 folklore.The parishes were,until      
 recently,remote and densely           
 wooded.There is only one surviving    
 menhir which forms part of a wall at  
 the junction between the Forest and   
 Petit Bot roads.                      
   The Perron Du Roi was moved across  
 the road to its present site in       
 1828.At one time it had been a        
 boundary marker.Later it became a     
 perron or mounting-block used by      
 horseman.This stone is four feet seven
 inches high and one foot six inches   
 wide at the base.It is eight inches   
 wide at the top.On its north-western  
 corner are three cupmarks,the largest 
 being three inches in diameter and    
 three quarters of an inch deep.       </content>
