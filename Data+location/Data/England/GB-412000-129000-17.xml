 exhibitions, demonstrations and       
 displays, musical events and drama all
 take place.{St Thomas's church}holds  
 a smaller festival every other year.

 in Salisbury and it's not festival    
 time,{the Playhouse, St. Edmund's Arts
{Centre}and{the Library}all have       
 regular exhibitions and other         
 activities taking place. The Playhouse
 has one large theatre and the smaller 
 Salberg Studio so that two plays can  
 be run at the same time. The Playhouse
 also has a bar, a restaurant and an   
 art gallery. Films can be seen at the
