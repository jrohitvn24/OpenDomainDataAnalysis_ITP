		<title>06The Wheelwright(Brockhampton</title>
		<content> The craft of the wheelwright is still 
 carried out by Mr.M. Roberts the local
 blacksmith.He uses a large piece of   
 elm to make the hub,turned in a lathe 
 to shape.Twelve oak spokes and six    
 fellies (the outside rim)with oak on  
 ash are made by hand.Then a length of 
 iron a little shorter than the outside
 rim of the wheel is joined together by
 heating in the forge.A large fire is  
 made and the iron band heated to      
 expand it.The wheel is placedon a band
 of iron (this band of iron been used  
 for generations)and fastened down.    
 When the band has expaned enough to   
 fit one.The wheel it is quickly       
 carried from the fire andplaced on the
 wheel.Cold water is quickly poured it 
 in to the hot band to make it shrink  
 and stop the wheel from burning at the
 same time large hammers are used to   
 bang the band against the wheel.      </content>
