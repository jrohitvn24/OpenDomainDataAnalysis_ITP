		<title>13BLACK CHAPEL.</title>
		<content>{Black Chapel}is in North End. It was  
 built about 1300 as a chapel connected
 to{Leez Priory.}Two monks lived in the
 house and worked there. They wore     
 black robes which is why it was called
 Black Chapel. It is a free church and 
 is used for services, Sunday school   
 and christenings, but cannot be used  
 for weddings. In World War 2 it was   
 damaged by a bomb but it has been     
 repaired now. The walls are timber    
 framed and filled with wattle and     
 daub.There is an old organ up on the  
 balcony. The pews are wooden and some 
 have doors and are like little rooms  
 Two old people still live in the house
 and they look after the church.
