		<title>16THE 'PADFOOIT'</title>
		<content> A 'Padfooit' is said to haunt Back    
 Lane in Cawthorne, near Head Road.It  
 is a dog-like creature about as big as
 a Great Dane.                         
   A person walking on his or her own  
 at night could hear the sound of      
 something galloping in the field      
 behind a wall. Near St. Julien's Way  
 in Cawthorne a footprint of the       
 creature is visible. It is a dent in  
 the ground . It appears to have huge  
 feet and is said to have saucer-like  
 eyes.                                 
    {ROVER.                            
  On  Gypsy lane is an old well. A long
 time ago one of the Huntsmen's dogs,  
 called Rover was thought to have      
 died. They threw the poor animal down 
 the shaft. However, the dog was not   
 dead . It survived in the well by     
 eating frogs and water rats. It was   
 there for 12 wks. before it was found.</content>
