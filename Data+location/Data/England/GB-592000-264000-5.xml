    Â£CROCKS' AN Â£IT' GAME              
                                       
  When you play Crocks there is someone
who is Â£it' and some more people who   
are NOT Â£it'.You have to play the game 
in a circle,and the people who are not 
Â£it' have to run through the circle,and
if one of them is caught then he or she
has to be Â£it', and the person who was 
Â£it' would not be Â£it' anymore.        
  If no-one was caught, then the person
who was Â£it' would still have to be    
Â£it'!
