		<content> My partner and I went to Durley       
 sawmill for an interview with one of  
 the owners.Then we asked him our      
 questions.They only buy their wood    
 from places like forests.They have a  
 total of 35-40 workers.The workers    
 come to work at 7.30am and leave at   
 4.30pm.They supply their wood to      
 fencers, the Coal Board and they make 
 fences and wooden palets.Their only   
 site is at Durley.Most of the workers 
 live in a six mile radius.They deliver
 their wood but usually hire a firm to 
 deliver for them.They deal in English 
 Hard and Soft wood.They deliver to a  
 150 mile radius.Every year theyhandle 
 a total of 4000 tons.They use a       
 computer to keep the records.
