		<title>10Smuggling illegal immigrants</title>
		<content> It was dark as we came closer to      
 the shore. We were smuggling illegal  
  immigrants. We were on the look out  
 for the coastgurds. We stopped the    
 engines and rowed toward land. When we
 landed our boat on the shore we looked
 for some where to hide the illegal    
 immigrants. We decided to hide them in
 Nanjzel house. As we climbed the rocks
 to the house we saw a Coastguards van.
 We ran to a near by cave with the     
 immigrants. The Coastguards came to   
 the cave where we were and caught two 
 of us but they did not find the rest  
 of us. The next day we went to the    
 nearest town to get the immigrants    
 onto a bus to London. When we got     
 there we had to get past the police.  
 We did it in the end. We got Â£500     
 from each immigrant. After that we    
 went back to the boat and set sail    
 again.                                </content>
