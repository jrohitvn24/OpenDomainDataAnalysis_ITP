 The eastern part of the               
 school'sDomesday area has in its      
 southern tip part of the              
 Hempdykes.Further north there is      
 FerryRoad, and Atkinson's Warren      
 whichis crossed by a footpath going   
 through from Crosby to the village of 
 Flixborough.The Hempdykes were part of
 Crosby parish where springs emerged   
 from a limestone ridge and ran down   
 the slope.Linseed was grown and the   
 water was used for washing the hemp.  
 The land has now been drained and a   
 housing estate with schools and shops 
 has been built.                       
 Atkinson's Warren is named after Mr.  
 W. Atkinson who lived in an isolated  
 stone cottage on the warren manyyears 
 ago.This became a breeding area for   
 silver haired rabbits whose fur at    
 one time was exported to Russia.      </content>
