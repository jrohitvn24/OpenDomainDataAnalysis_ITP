		<title>09BASILDON NE: SCHOOL DAYS</title>
		<content> Well, I go to junior school at quarter
 to nine and I go in and then the bell 
 goes. I start work. I usually begin   
 with mathematics, and later in the    
 morning I either write a story or do  
 some other English.                   
 In the afternoon I do topic work, when
 I work on something which interests   
 me. One topic has been about a river  
 and the things that are found by it,  
 the villages and the industries.      
 Another has been about clothes and the
 way they have changed. My favourite   
 work is about animals, usually birds  
 and the other small creatures we can  
 find around us.                       
 I enjoy being in my class, but some   
 things in school I don't like.        
 Assemblies can be boring - don't do   
 this, don't do that - and I don't like
 Christmas time because the whole      
 school has to do plays.               </content>
