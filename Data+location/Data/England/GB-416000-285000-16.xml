		<content> The land in the block is fairly flat  
 varying between 90 and 100 metres     
 above sea level. The River Cole flows 
 west to east across the northern      
 section to join the River Blythe.     
   The Chelmsley Wood housing estate is
 between 15 and 20 years old and was   
 purpose built on Green Belt land. In  
 the centre of the estate is the town  
 centre a two storey brick and         
 concrete shopping precinct. Near the  
 centre there is a police station,     
 telephone exchange and library all    
 concrete structures.                  
   The area is dominated by the multi  
 storey blocks of flats. There are     
 about 25 of these concrete buildings  
 from about 10 to 13 storeys high. The 
 low rise housing is mainly red brick  
 built and there are large areas of    
 grass and open space in between.
