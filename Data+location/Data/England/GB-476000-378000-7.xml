		<title>07TRESWELL CHURCH</title>
		<content> We attend our church every Sunday     
 morning at 11.00 o'clock and take part
 in the service. Usually we arrive     
 early to hand out Hymnbooks and       
 sometimes we ring the bells. As we    
 enter the graveyard we look at the old
 tombstones. The font is over five     
 hundred years old and there is also a 
 rare Vinegar Bible. The Communion cup 
 was made in the reign of Queen        
 Elizabeth 1st, and it is of solid     
 silver. Local children go to church   
 because they get a lot of enjoyment   
 out of the service and it is a way in 
 which they can serve and be a part of 
 the community.
