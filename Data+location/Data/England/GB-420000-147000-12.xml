		<title>12ENTERTAINMENT IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  By virtue of Tidworth being a        
 garrison town many of the entertain-  
 ments available to the populace are   
 sports orientated. Amongst the games  
 played are rugby,football,hockey,golf,
 squash,tennis,cricket,swimming and    
 croquet. Motorcycle scrambling takes  
 place on Chalk Pit Hill. Horse riding 
 and its related activities is also    
 popular. We have a cinema,clubs and   
 bingo. The pubs and drinking places   
 are always popular. Most gardens are  
 well tended and there are allotments  
 in both North and South Tidworth,     
 controlled by the Parish Councils.    
 Children enjoy using the many play    
 areas and cycling especially with BMX 
 bicycles is still a favourite pastime.
 During the year travelling fairs and a
 circus come to the village. There is  
 an annual Carnival and Church events  
 including a fete,Barn Dance and sales.</content>
