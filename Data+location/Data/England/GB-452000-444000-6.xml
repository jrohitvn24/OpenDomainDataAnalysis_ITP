		<content> Employment in Bilbrough in 1985.      
                                       
 There is little employment in         
 Bilbrough except at the school and the
 pub.There are 3 farmers,who employ a  
 few farmworkers.More than half of the 
 villagers are retired, and the others 
 are mainly commuters.These include 7  
 teachers, 2 solicitors, 3 surveyors,  
 an architect, sales representatives   
 and brewery administrative staff.Many 
 of the women work as part_time        
 clerical assistants.                  
 The arts are represented by 3         
 professional singers and a fashion    
 model.                                
 Most young people go away to college  
 or university,when they leave school. 
 The rest usually find work in York or 
 Tadcaster before moving away.
