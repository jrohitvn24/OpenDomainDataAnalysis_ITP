 Before,the land was used to graze     
 horses.There is one main building and 
 8 huts.We have{360 children}in 1985,  
 and{16 teachers.}There are two classes
 in our area,which is really the dining
 room.We have small blue tables as     
 desks and locker trays for our books. 
 One side of our area is covered with  
 books shelves,which are full.We are   
 lucky to have a large school field.   
 Sometimes we have our{lessons}in 1    
 large group.Mostly in the morning,we  
 have Maths,English and Assembly.      
 Afternoon lessons are like Topic,     
 Science,Games and Art.We watch T.V. 3 
 times a week, often pre-recorded on   
 video.We also use computers,which are 
 new and exciting; and work with       
 calculators in Maths.We have just     
 started learning French (3rd.year).   </content>
