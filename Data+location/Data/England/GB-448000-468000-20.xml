		<title>20The 'new' schools</title>

 Nearly all children between 5 and 16  
 years old go to either the primary or 
 the comprehensive schools in          
 Easingwold.Those from outlying farms  
 rely on their own transport, otherwise
 there are school buses running through
 Raskelf.Children were generally happy 
 with their schools, parents sometimes 
 were worried about the size of schools
 today.The comprehensive has over 1200 
 pupils which is felt to be a massive  
 change for those who went to the old  
 village school.Another view was that  
 those who wanted to do well did so,   
 but those who needed pushing might get
 firmer treatment somewhere else.A     
 value of the comprehensive was felt to
 be the facilities it provided for     
 evening classes, a youth club and     
 swimming in the summer holidays.
