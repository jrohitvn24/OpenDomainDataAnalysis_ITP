		<title>13HOME LIFE An adult's day</title>
		<content> An average day for me starts with my  
 getting up first.I cook breakfast for 
 my husband and make his packed lunch. 
 I then cook my two sons' breakfast.   
 It may be a day to get the washing    
 machine out.Making the beds fits in   
 between hanging out the washing.Our   
 dog requires an hours walk.At the     
 beginning and end of the working week 
 I clean the house right through.I also
 make all our bread once a week. Most  
 household and food shopping I buy once
 a fortnight in the nearest large town.
 I may visit a friend.                 
  The boys are home about 4 p.m. and I 
 cook the evening meal for 6-6.30 p.m. 
 One night a week I play badminton at a
 local club.I do typing and the        
 financial books for my husband's      
 business.I usually watch the          
 television other evenings, perhaps    
 whilst knitting.(Mrs.Georgina Darling)</content>
