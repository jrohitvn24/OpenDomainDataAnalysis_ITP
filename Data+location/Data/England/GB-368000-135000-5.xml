		<content> Our interviewee has lived in our area 
 since 1943.She has noticed quite a few
 changes.One of the largest changes has
 been a lot more traffic,especially    
 lorries going to get weighed at a     
 local factory where there is a        
 weighbridge.                          
           She told us that about three
 months ago Cogley Wood was protected  
 and fenced off so nobody could destroy
 the woodland or wildlife.             
           She thinks the flood        
 prevention scheme is a very good      
 idea,and worth having it built.       
           In her spare time she's been
 studying the history of Bruton and    
 Eastrip,and is in the middle of       
 writing a book about it.Her husband   
 was a famous sculptor who died in     
 1976.
