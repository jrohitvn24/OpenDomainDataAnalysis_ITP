 moated Manor House situated in        
 woodland off the Hampton Lane. This

 building but much of it was destroyed 
 in the 1800s.The present Hall has many
 rooms including 6 bedrooms, 2         
 bathrooms, storerooms and pantries.   
 Many of the rooms have garderobes, now
 used as dressing rooms.               
   The front porch has been restored   
 and the beams are carved with Latin   
 inscriptions and a monogram of the    
 Waring family.                        
   The Waring family lived in the house
 for about 200 years, until about 1718.
 Since then there have been a variety  
 of owners.
