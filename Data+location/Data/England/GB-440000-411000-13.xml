		<content>{Jogging}                              
 Jogging has become very popular. A lot
 of people are taking up running for   
 exercise and they go to keep fit      
 classes to prepare for their running. 
 First of all they will start to jog on
 the roads steadily for about a mile,  
 then they will increase their distance
 gradually.                            
 Some people then become interested in 
 running and train for and enter races;
 others may enter marathons but you    
 need to be very fit for this.         
 I enjoy running in races and training 
 for them and I also like to watch     
 others race. My favourite runner is   
 Steve Cram.
