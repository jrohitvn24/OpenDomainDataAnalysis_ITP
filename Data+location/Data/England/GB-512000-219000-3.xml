		<content> On Wednesday July 3rd a group of      
 children from my school went to talk  
 to Mr. Sharp and he showed us around  
 the farm.I saw two newly born         
 calves.We saw where they sleep,eat and
 live in the Spring,Autunm and         
 Winter.We saw the metel containers    
 where the milk was stored.Mr.Sharp has
 20 fields.He divides his fields with  
 electric fencing.He puts his cows in  
 a different field every day.Mr. Sharps
 cows are a pedigree herd of British   
 Friesans.Sometimes the cows drink 10  
 gallons of water every day.At         
 Mr.Sharps farm we saw the cows in the 
 fields.As we stood and talked in the  
 field the cows surrounded us.One cow  
 licked my clip board.
