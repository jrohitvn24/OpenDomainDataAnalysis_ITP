		<content> Each year a{charity group}called the  
{Coverack Christmas Tree Appeal}sets up
 a Christmas tree overlooking the      
 harbour. Just prior to Christmas a    
 large tent is erected close to the    
 tree, under which food is prepared and
 a barbeque set up. Close by a nativity
 scene is acted out. Bags of sweets and
 fruit are prepared. These are given   
 free to all children in attendance on 
 the Saturday evening of the{Coverack  
{Christmas Tree.}People from miles     
 around come to the village to sing    
 carols by the harbour around the tree.
 A procession of gnomes (the infant    
 children of the village) led by a     
 sleigh carrying Father Christmas      
 starts the proceedings. Food is sold, 
 raffles and collections organised. The
 money is raised for{local charities;  
 the major part going to{local         
{children's homes.                     </content>
