		<title>03Factories In Kingswood.</title>
		<content>    Along Station Road there is a row  
 of factories.They produce a variety of
 products,such as frozen foods,tin ware
 etc. At Avon Tin, where they make     
 tins,trays and ashtrays,part_workers  
 earn about thirty eight pounds a      
 week,and full_timers around sixty     
 pounds. It does not cause inconvenence
 to anybody and is not noisy.The other 
 factories also cause no inconvenience 
 because the machinery is electric and 
 there is no smoke pollution. All these
 factories are quite modern, the       
 biggest factory along Station Road is 
 Brains. It has seven hundred workers. 
 They make frozen foods such as        
 pasties,pies and faggots etc. One of  
 the factories,Frenchay Products,has a 
 glass front and looks like a big      
 office,shop or school. Next year there
 will be one new factory which is being
 built at the moment in 1985.          </content>
