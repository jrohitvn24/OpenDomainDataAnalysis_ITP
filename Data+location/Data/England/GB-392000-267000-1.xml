		<content> The area to the SW of Bromsgrove is   
 mostly rural in aspect,the land cover 
 is largely of uncultivated grassland, 
 but residential areas are increasing. 
 The largest residential area is the   
 estate of{Charford,}originally built  
 to house the workers of{Garringtons,  
 once the greatest source of employment
 in the town. These council houses are 
 now being offered for sale to the     
 tenants,offers which are accepted in  
 most cases.{Stoke Prior}is a village 2
 miles SSW of the town and has many    
 small industries as well as the larger
{Bayer(UK).}Once a 'salt' village, the 
 old workers cottages have been        
 replaced by modern housing estates.   
 The two-carriageway{M5 motorway}is    
 undergoing major widening alterations 
 to accommodate the increasing traffic 
 travelling between the south and the  
 north of England.                     </content>
