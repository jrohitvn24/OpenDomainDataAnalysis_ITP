		<title>03Housing Estates in Knowle</title>
		<content>      Since World War 2, suburban      
 housing estates have spread S.W. from 
 Knowle to Dorridge absorbing the      
 former hamlet of Bently Heath. The    
 most recent estates are still being   
 built at Bently Heath where 360, 3 and
 4 bedroom, freehold, detached,        
 "luxury" houses are nearing completion
 at "Knowle Keep" and "Tilehouse       
 Green".                               
      The earlier 1960's and 1970's    
 estates were nearer to Knowle and like
 the more recent estates these were    
 built on former "green field" sites.  
 As most people now own a car, these   
 estates are composed entirely of      
 housing and have no shops or other    
 community facilities. Most of the     
 houses in the area are Â£30,000+.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
