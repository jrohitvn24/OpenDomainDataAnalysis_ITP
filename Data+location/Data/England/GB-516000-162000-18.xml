		<content>{Troops of the}Royal Engineers{built   
{the embankment further along its      
{intended route as a training exercise.
{The abandoned workings, still to be   
{seen near Chalky Lane, have long since
{been covered in undergrowth.          
    Nov.6,1947 saw the first fatal     
 accident on the line.  A crash in     
 dense fog killed 4 passengers near    
 Motspur Park.  In 1954, the Queen went
 home from the Derby via Chessington   
 South station.                        
{   The line today is very much a local
{asset; most of the journeys are short 
{'hops' between Malden &amp; Chessington.  
{Schoolchildren use it to cross the    
{Borough N to S, &amp; commuters travel    
{into}LONDON{daily via Chessington     
{North &amp; Tolworth stations in          
{particular.
