		<content> The area is sparsely populated, having
 a total of 147 persons (5 children    
 under 5 years, 31 of school age, 94 of
 working age and 17 over 60 years).    
 Occupation of residents: In an area   
 where the chief employment was once in
 farming &amp; mining, there is now a wide 
 variety of occupations; most people   
 commuting by car to their place of    
 work. There are 16 farmers, also      
 teachers, social workers, builders,   
 restauranteurs, physiotherapists,     
 a probation officer, doctor, architect
 librarian, health visitor, hairdresser
 insurance broker, agricultural        
 salesman, retired dentist, car        
 salesman and a potter. Some retired   
 farmers earn a living by grass-letting
 their land for summer grazing. Many   
 professional families live in former  
 farmhouses, the land having been sold 
 off to enlarge existing units.        </content>
