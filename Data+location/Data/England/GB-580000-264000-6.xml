		<content>  Many of the leisure facilities used  
the people in the area are located     
in the town which boasts a Sports      
Centre, roller skating rink, and       
cinema which are particularly          
important to young people. The public  
transport, however, is not good and    
rural residents rely heavily on        
private transport. In the village      
considerable attempts are made to make 
their own recreation and activities    
include fetes, play groups for the     
very young, bingo, Brownies, Guides,   
Cubs and Scouts, youth club, gardening,
dancing, woodwork and drama clubs. The 
church is also very active as is the   
Over 60's club.
