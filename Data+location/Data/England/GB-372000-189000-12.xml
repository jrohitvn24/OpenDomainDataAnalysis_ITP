		<title>12A DAIRY FARM</title>
		<content>  Most of the work on the farm is      
 connected with the cows which have to 
 be milked twice a day. Milking the    
 cows involves wetting the dairy floor,
 taking the cows into the dairy,milking
 them, letting them back into the field
 and finally cleaning all the cow muck 
 out of the dairy. This has to be done 
 both morning and afternoon.           
 Occasionally the farmer muck out the  
 sheds, spreads muck on the fields,    
 puts silage into the cow kennels,     
 makes hay and silage, bags silage and 
 stacks hay. The farmer also has to    
 mend fencing and keep records, which  
 involves writing the names of the     
 cows,their numbers and how much milk  
 they have given. Most of the work is  
 done by machine, such as tractors and 
 bailers.
