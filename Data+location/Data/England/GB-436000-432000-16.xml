		<title>16THE VICAR OF WHITKIRK</title>
		<content> The present vicar of Whitkirk Church  
 is{Rev. Michael Hunter}who succeeded  
 Kranston Garrett in 1978. He is also  
 chaplain to Yorkshire Television and  
 so has a very{busy life}running the   
 church. When he can find the time he  
 likes to watch{Leeds United}play      
 football and the cricket at{Headingly.
                                       
 The church has{two curates, a verger, 
{church wardens, sidesmen,}as well as  
{scouts, guides, cubs and brownies.    
 Together with other groups Mr. Hunter 
 estimates that possibly the best part 
 of a{thousand people}are involved with
 the church in one way or another.     
                                       
 His busy life means that he does not  
 always see as much of his family as he
 would like.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
