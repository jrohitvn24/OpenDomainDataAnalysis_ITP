		<content>{The Whitegate Way-WHITEGATE.          
   The Whitegate Way is a public       
 footpath running on the route of a    
 disused railway. The railway ran from 
 Cuddington. The footpath is six miles 
 long.In the future this walk will link
 up with the Wirral Country Park, the  
 Sandstone Trail in the Peckforton     
 Hills and the Gritstone Way in        
 Macclesfield. This will make a long   
 distance footpath across Cheshire.    
   The Whitegate Way is very busy at   
 the weekend. People come to walk and  
 jog and to exercise their dogs and    
 horses. There is a wide variety of    
 wildlife including badgers, foxes,    
 squirrels and rabbits and many less   
 common birds such as yellowhammers,   
 siskins and kingfishers.Mr.McGeagh and
 Mr.Oulton are the Whitegate Rangers,  
 responsible for the day to day running
 and maintenance along the walk.       </content>
