The inscription on the front of the    
former Trust School reads,"By A.D 1260 
there is evidence of a school in       
Yardley.The masters were monks from    
Maxstoke priory.This present building  
probably dates from the 15th century.It
may have originally have been the Guild
Hall.W.Sutherns was the last master.The
school closed in 1908.It is now used   
as Parish rooms with a Youth Club      
upstairs, the Sarah Hassell Lounge     
downstairs. The bracket for the school 
bell still remains in the gable.The    
School closed in 1908 when the local   
authority,Worcestershire County        
council,built a new school near the Yew
Tree.Built on to the timber framed     
block,are early 19th century           
additions,built for the schoolmaster.  
Schoolmaster James Chell's gravestone  
remains in the churchyard.             </content>
