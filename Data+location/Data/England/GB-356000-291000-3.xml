		<title>03DEREK'S MOBILE SHOP</title>
		<content>    Around{Brockton}there are no shops 
 so we have{Derek's Mobile}Shop. It is 
 a big,red van and it runs on Deisel   
 oil.  In the shop part there are red  
 wire racks where all the stock goes.  
    It sells toys,sweets,dog food,     
 cat food, washing up liquid and       
 lots more things.                     
    The fruit is kept under the racks  
 and so are the vegetables. Most       
 of those need to be weighed. The      
 scales are electric, you plug them    
 into the van's  battery.              
 There are some dials and buttons.     
    The money is kept in a wooden      
 tray under the racks. There is a      
 small calculator till with a till     
 roll. You pull the ticket and rip it  
 off. The shop goes out on Wednesday   
 Thursday and Friday each week.
