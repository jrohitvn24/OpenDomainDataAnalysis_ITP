		<title>07THE GREEN IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> The Green was, originally, used by the
 villagers as pasture. At the western  
 end is a memorial to the men of the   
 village who were killed in the wars of
 1914-18 and 1939-45. There is a       
 flagpole where a flag is flown on     
 special occasions.                    
     The Green is now used as a meeting
 place for many outdoor activities. In 
 winter, football is played, while, in 
 summer, the men play cricket and the  
 women play stoolball and croquet.     
     On the last Monday in August, the 
 Flower show is held in a large tent.  
 Local gardeners vie with each other to
 produce the best exhibits while cooks 
 display their cakes and children show 
 their craftwork. In September the fair
 arrives with rides and sideshows and  
 occasionally a small circus will set  
 up to entertain the villagers.
