{POST OFFICE.}A small Post Office      
 operates from  within a private house 
 on the Common.                        
{VILLAGE SCHOOL.}This very old school  
 still caters for the educational needs
 of the 5 to 11  year old children from
 quite a wide catchment area.Numbers on
 roll have dropped over the last few   
 years to between 50 and 60 pupils.At  
 11years of age pupils move to the     
 Chantry High School,Martley(6 miles   
 away).                                
{VILLAGE CHURCHES.}                    
{ST.MICHAEL'S.}Stands in the old       
 village (next to the Rectory).Although
 very little of it is standing today,a 
 few weekly services are still held    
 there.Often local families prefer to  
 have weddings and christenings in this
 delightful old building with its long 
 history.                              </content>
