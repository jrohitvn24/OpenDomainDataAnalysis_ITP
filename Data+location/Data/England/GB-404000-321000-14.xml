		<title>14Religion of Blithfield</title>
		<content> Blithfield church is used by Church of
 England worshippers and is in the     
 Lichfield diocese.  The recent        
 incumbnt has left and the new vicar is
 also that priest for Abbots bromley.  
 The congreation meets once a week on  
 Sunday and comprises an average of 25 
 people most of them from local farming
 families coming from as far afield as 
 Kingston and Abbots Bromley.  Most    
 members are over 40 years of age.     
 Only one family group attends         
 regularly and even the harvest        
 Festival is not well attended.  There 
 is an active Mothers Union but no     
 choir or Sunday School. Two church    
 wardens care for the church and a     
 flower rota is used.  Members of the  
 Mothers Union clean the church.  Money
 is raised by a garden party held      
 annually at Lea Hall Farm and         
 sometimes they hold a bazzaar.        </content>
