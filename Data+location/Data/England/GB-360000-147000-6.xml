		<title>06BREWERIES OF OAKHILL</title>
		<content> The long established industry of      
 Oakhill is brewing, which was begun in
 the 1790's. In recent years after a   
 serious fire, in 1925, the original   
 Oakhill Brewery was reorganised and   
 Courage sited a Maltings in the       
 village. The building is now used for 
 drying and soaking the malt. In 1986  
 there is hoped to be an expansion of  
 10 more silos to hold grain, but there
 is a lot of controversy about it in   
 the village. It employs 17 people. One
 of the buildings of the old brewery is
 now used as an independent brewery.   
 During recent years 3 men have        
 produced between 20 and 50 barrels of 
 beer a week. One man does the         
 deliveries and the other two make the 
 beer. They call themselves the Oakhill
 Brewery and sell the beer in the      
 surrounding area.
