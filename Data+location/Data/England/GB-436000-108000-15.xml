		<title>15The elderly in Marchwood</title>
		<content> There are lots of facilities for the {
{elderly in Marchwood.}There is a Darby
 and Joan club which provides a lot of 
 activities for the old people.These   
 include outings,concerts and whist    
 drives,and it provides an opportunity 
 for the elderly to meet each other and
 chat over a cup of tea.               
      There is a welfare association   
 for the elderly in Marchwood,which    
 amongst other things helps provide a  
 Christmas present for every pensioner 
 in the parish.                        
       A clever {bell alarm system}has 
 been installed in nearly every        
 pensioner's house.If they are in      
 trouble they push a button inside the 
 house and a loud alarm will ring      
 outside and alert neighbours.Wardened 
 bungalows for the elderly are soon to 
 be built in the centre of Marchwood   
 close to the new shopping centre.     </content>
