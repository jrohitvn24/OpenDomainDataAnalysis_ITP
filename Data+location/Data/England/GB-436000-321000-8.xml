		<content> This is a well wooded area,principally
 in small spinneys of predominantly    
 deciduous trees,&amp; occasional small    
 plantings of conifers in former       
 parkland. Ash predominates with a fair
 number of oak,beech &amp; horsechestnut.  
 Where scrub has been allowed to take  
 over,as at Dimminsdale,it is usually  
 silver birch &amp; alder at the water's   
 edge.There are many gaps where elms,  
 lately victims of Dutch Elm Disease,  
 have been felled in copses &amp;          
 hedgerows. Replanting has begun,      
 usually with lime,beech &amp; oak.The oaks
 of Calke park are of tremendous girth 
 &amp; considerable age &amp; are gradually    
 falling limb from limb.There are      
 plantations of pine at the water's    
 edge of Staunton Harold.
