		<title>15A DAY IN KATHARINE'S LIFE</title>
		<content>   ON A SUNNY FRIDAY I WOULD GET UP AT 
 8 O'CLOCK, GET WASHED AND DRESSED AND 
 THEN AT ABOUT 8.15 GO DOWN FOR        
 BREAKFAST, WHICH IS USUALLY CEREAL AND
 BREAD.  I WOULD THEN GATHER MY THINGS 
 READY FOR SCHOOL, SETTING OFF AT 8.45.
  WHEN I ARRIVE AT SCHOOL EVERYONE,    
 INCLUDING THE INFANTS, GOES INTO      
 ASSEMBLY, THEN WE GO BACK TO THE      
 CLASSROOM FOR MATHS.  PLAY COMES NEXT,
 FROM 10.20 TILL 10.40.  AFTER PLAY WE 
 HAVE MORE MATHS OR ENGLISH.  NEXT WE  
 HAVE OUR LUNCH AND THEN PLAY.  THE    
 LUNCH BREAK LASTS FROM 11.55 TO 1.05. 
 IN THE AFTERNOON WE HAVE HANDWRITING  
 AND AFTER THAT WE HAVE OUR LAST PLAY, 
 WHICH STARTS AT 2.05.  WE FINISH OUR  
 SCHOOL TIME WITH P.E..  MUM OR DAD    
 COLLECT ME FROM SCHOOL.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
