		<title>03A VILLAGE PUB AND BREWERY</title>
		<content> There are 2 Public Houses in the      
 block,both in Marsh Gibbon,one        
 being{"The Greyhound".}The first      
 written records appear in the 1700's. 
 A diary exists which records how a    
{Richard Heritage}brewed beer there in 
 l833.                                 
 The present owners extensively        
 renovated the pub and added a         
 restaurant. In 1981 they revived the  
 brewing tradition as the{"Phillips    
{Brewing Company"}with the landlords   
 eldest son as head brewer.The beers   
 are given names to celebrate village  
 history. For example{" Heritage       
{Traditional Bitter"}named after the   
 19th century brewer and{"Alirics Old  
{Ale"}named after Aliric the Saxon who 
 owned land in Marsh Gibbon before the 
 Norman Conquest.                      
 The 199 year old{Marsh Gibbon Friendly
{Society}still meets there.            </content>
