		<content>   The area we had been given to       
 investigate was chiefly rural.There   
 were a lot of arable farms, some mixed
 farms, and some orchards.The farms    
 were mainly small, compared to modern 
 standards, and many of the farms were 
 called Halls.Some examples are New    
 Hall,Hannam's Hall and Brett's Hall.  
   The available land is used          
 intensively, and the main crops were  
 wheat,barley,sugar beet,rape seed and 
 peas.There was some pasture land on   
 the mixed farms for cows and sheep.   
   The area is largely flat, with      
 shallow valleys, having tributaries to
 the Holland Brook.                    
   The two main centres of population  
 are Tendring and Weeley.Weeley is     
 served by British Rail, but the       
 station was just outside our given    
 area.Eastern National Omnibuses serve 
 both Tendring and Weeley.             </content>
