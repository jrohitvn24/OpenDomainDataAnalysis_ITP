		<title>02Marchwood Parish Church</title>
		<content>{St.John's Church Marchwood was built  
 in 1842 by a Mr.Holloway, who owned   
 the big house at Marchwood Park.About 
 60 baptisms, 20 funerals and 15       
 weddings take place each year.On      
 Sunday about 60 people usually go to  
 morning services and a Sunday school  
 is held for children as well.The      
 church choir also performs concerts   
 throughout the year.                  
     The outside of the church is      
 beginning ot look rather shabby as    
 it hasn't been decorated for over 7   
 years.The present vicar thinks that   
 the church is too big.                
       Just outside the church is a    
 memorial to those killed on the Royal 
 Fleet Auxiliary ship 'Sir Galahad' in 
 the Falklands War.  The ship was      
 based at the Marchwood Army Port.
