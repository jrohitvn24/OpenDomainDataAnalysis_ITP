		<title>11Bardon Hill Village</title>
		<content>{Bardon Hill village}grew up because of
 the need to house the quarry          
 workers{.The Old Row},a row of 40     
 terraced houses,was built first,then a
 similar row called{The Crescent}was   
 built several years later.The first   
{school}was built in the Old Row in    
 1877 and our present school was built 
 in 1895.We have 68 children on roll.  
  There is no real centre to Bardon    
 village and the only{amenities}are a  
 Post Office,a pub,church and a sports 
 field.As well as The Old Row and The  
 Crescent there are other cottages,    
 houses and farms scattered around the 
 area and some industry down Grange    
 Road{.Bardon Hall},which stands in a  
 fine position in woodland on Bardon   
 Hill,once stood further down the hill 
 but the owners moved it to get a      
 better view.The{moat}which surrounded 
 it still remains on the original site.</content>
