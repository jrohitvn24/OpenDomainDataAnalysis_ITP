 Strowger exchange.On 1.7.1985 there   
 were 505 lines connected.There are 40 
 junction circuits to Hereford and 12  
 to Kington.In 1940 there was a manual 
 exchange at the Post Office.          
 The{Post Office}has been on the same  
 site and in the same family since 1918
 The lady runs it alone.To have a      
 holiday she must get a relief.She     
 sells the same as a large P.O.        
 Pensioners are her most regular       
 customers.Many passersby use the P.O. 
 because it is easy to park.The post   
 box is emptied twice a day.The post   
 goes to Kington first,then to Hereford
 There is a{police}house in Eardisley  
 with a resident woman police constable
 She is based at Kington and covers a  
 wide area in her police car which is  
 linked to the computer at Worcester.  </content>
