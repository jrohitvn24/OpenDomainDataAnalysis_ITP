		<title>16KIT HILL</title>
		<content> Kit Hill dominates this block,        
 covering 7 of the squares. lOO years  
 ago it was grey with the spoil heaps  
 of tin mining and granite quarrying   
 but today the{industrial past}is      
 covered with heather, gorse and       
 brambles. Several shafts and adits    
 remain, but only one ruined engine    
 house and 3 chimneys. The chimney     
 stack on the summit now carries       
 short-wave aerials. Remains nearby of 
 a banked enclosure are believed to    
 pre-date the mining era. Detailed     
 archaeological investigation has yet  
 to be carried out.Part of the Duchy of
 Cornwall estate, it has been given to 
 the county by HRH Prince Charles for a
{country park.}The public has had      
 access to the hill for many years,    
 although from l928 to l978 a toll was 
 levied by a committee maintaining the 
 road which is now in bad condition.   </content>
