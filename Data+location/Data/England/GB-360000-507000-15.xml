		<title>15M6 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content>  The M6 motorway which passes through 
 the area was opened on 23rd October   
 1970 by the then Minister of Transport
 Mr John Peyton. Christiani Shand were 
 the main construction engineers to    
 work on this part of the M6. This     
 section of the motorway is unique in  
 this country in that the two carriage-
 ways are, in places, up to half a mile
 apart. The reason for this being the  
 severe winter conditions experienced  
 in this area. In particularly heavy   
 snowfalls it is possible to concen-   
 trate snow clearing activities to one 
 carriageway, using a two-way traffic  
 flow on that carriageway.             
  Tebay West service area supplies the 
 needs of motorists on the north bound 
 carriageway. It was opened in 1972. In
 1976 Tebay Mountain Lodge, a Motel,   
 was opened, providing accommodation   
 for up to 70 guests.                  </content>
