		<content>      St. Edmund Arrowsmith is a Roman 
 Catholic Secondary School. Everyday we
 have eight lessons, which each last   
 thirty five minutes. The following are
 some of the subjects studied, Craft,  
 Mathematics, English, French,         
 Religious Education, Science,         
 Geography and History.                
      There are four different types of
 school in Blackburn, Nursery School   
 for 3 to 5 year olds, Infant School   
 for 5 to 7 year olds, Junior School   
 for 7 to 11 year olds and Secondary   
 School for 11 to 18 year olds.        
      When you have finished Secondary 
 School you can go on to College,      
 Polytechnic or University. There you  
 will specialise in one subject. You   
 will spend a few years here and gain a
 qualification, such as a degree.      
 Alternatively you may leave school at 
 any time after the age of 16.         </content>
