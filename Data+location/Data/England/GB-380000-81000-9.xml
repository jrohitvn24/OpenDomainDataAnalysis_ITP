		<content> Commercial forestry is undertaken by  
 the Forestry Commission who have a 200
 year lease (from 1958) from the Weld  
 Estate on Burngate Wood in the        
 South-East corner of the block.       
 Around the perimeter Beech has been   
 planted as a shelter belt. Within this
 Corsican Pine is grown as a           
 commmercial crop.                     
 Oak and Ash which have established    
 themselves naturally are left to      
 develope as specimen trees where ever 
 possible.                             
 There are no public rights of way     
 within the Wood. Therefore the Weld   
 Estate use it to rear pheasants which 
 are shot by organised parties during  
 the winter.
