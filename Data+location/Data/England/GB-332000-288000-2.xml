		<title>02BISHOPS CASTLE 2</title>
		<content> Bishops Castle used to have a Railway 
 line which ran from{Bishops Castle    
 to{Craven Arms.}It opened in 1865 and 
 closed in 1935 because it went        
 bankrupt.It is a pity it is not open  
 today because it would probably be the
 main tourists attraction.There are    
 still a few remains of the tracks and 
 station.Where the Railway used to     
 stand there is now an Industrial      
 estate.                               
   There is a place near the bottom of 
 the town called the{Playing Fields},  
 where lots of people go.People go     
 there to play on a see saw,a slide, a 
 roundabout and some swings or you     
 could just go for a walk.There is a   
 football pitch where anyone is allowed
 to play.Opposite there are some       
 climbing frames for little children.  
 There is a log to climb on as well.
