		<title>18WINDMILL HILL FARM</title>
		<content> The farm was built before 1581.It is 4
 hundred feet above sea level.Windmill 
 Hill Farm is a funny name for it      
 because there is no sign of a windmill
 When it was built all the windows     
 were on the north side because people 
 believed the south wind brought the   
 plague.The first family to live at the
 farm were the Pawsons.They lived there
 until 1695.The next family were the   
 Allens.They lived there until 1862.The
 next three families were the          
 Brownlows, the Elliots, and the Rhodes
 the present family is the Edens.The   
 farmhouse is a protected building.A   
 few years ago they ran a riding school
 but it was too expensive to run.Now it
 is a livery stables.They have only got
 five horses now.In the farmhouse there
 are some big stone fireplaces.
