		<title>03Landscape,  Drainage</title>
		<content> As the area is low_lying the landscape
 is governed by drainage. Some fields  
 still have regular undulations known  
 as gripes to facilitate drainage into 
 the ditches. The ditches and          
 footbridges are maintained by the     
 farmers. The Inland Drainage Board has
 responsibility for land up to 8 feet  
 above known high tide level, so they  
 maintain the rhines into which ditches
 drain.  Rhines flow west and discharge
 into the Chessil Rhine and onto the   
 Severn. The rhines are cleared of weed
 yearly. Most are below land level but 
 Tockington Mill Rhine is a high level 
 rhine carrying water across the area. 
 Where a high level crosses a low level
 rhine there are coffer goughs,        
 syphonic arrangements to maintain     
 water level. There are two in this    
 area.
