		<content> There are branches of three major     
 banks in Holmes Chapel.  All are very 
 busy, despite many customers having   
 their accounts at branches elsewhere. 
 This is due to so many people moving  
 into the area to live and keeping     
 their accounts at branches either near
 their place of work or near to their  
 previous home.  Nevertheless, all     
 normal facilities are available,      
 although there is sometimes delay when
 a larger office has to be contacted.  
                                       
 There are agencies of major building  
 societies based in the offices of the 
 three estate agents.  These societies 
 enable people to save money, borrow   
 money for the purchase of homes or    
 repay outstanding mortgages.  The     
 estate agents sell property on behalf 
 of house owners and are extremely busy
 due to the mobility of the population.</content>
