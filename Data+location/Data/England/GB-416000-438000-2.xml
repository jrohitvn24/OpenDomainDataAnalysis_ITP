		<title>02Esholt..Introduction 1</title>
		<content> In 1985,when pupils of Nab Wood       
 Grammar School made their new survey, 
 Esholt was a village of mostly old,   
 corporation-owned houses. The most    
 recently built dated from the turn of 
 the century.Stone for some houses and 
 a community centre came from two      
 demolished woollen mills.             
 Documents show that in 1953 the       
 village had 365 inhabitants,mostly    
 elderly.The nearest doctor lived in   
 Guiseley.The area is still quiet and  
 rural,with a large amount of farm and 
 woodland.Since the 1930s Esholt's most
 distinctive feature has been its      
{sewage works}which cut the village off
 from Apperley Bridge.The road now has 
 a wall across where there was once a  
 toll-gate.It is nationally famous now,
 however,as the village where Yorkshire
 Television film their popular drama   
 series{Emmerdale Farm.}               </content>
