		<content> My take away is Chinese and is called 
 the Silver Moon. My parents came from 
 Hong_Kong 16 years ago and opened our 
 shop.We open from 11.30 to 2p.m every 
 day except Sunday.We are open every   
 evening from 7 p.m till 11.30 but on  
 Fridays and Saturdays we close at     
 midnight.The busiest day is Saturday. 
 most people get there meals then.We   
 start to prepare the meals \ an hour  
 before we open.my mother and father   
 and my two sisters prepare the meals  
 we have four very large woks;one of   
 them is for frying and the others for 
 cooking.A lot of our ingredients come 
 from Hong_Kong.Most people buy chips  
 and house special,which is a mixture  
 of stir fried vegetables and meat.
