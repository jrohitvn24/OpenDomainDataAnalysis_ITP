		<content>{Farmland.}The dipslope of the         
 Limestone Tabular Hills rises gently  
 to the north of the Pickering-Thornton
 road.The land makes excellent farmland
 and is extensively covered with large 
 arable fields.In the face of pressure 
 for land from commercial farming      
 interests it is desirable to conserve 
 some habitats in their natural        
 condition.                            
{Ellerburn.}Here there is a small      
 nature reserve owned by the Yorkshire 
 Wildlife Trust. On the bank top there 
 are many orchids which have to        
 be protected.                         
 Every year a course on ecology is     
 organised by the {Workers' Education  
{Association,}and this consists of 10  
 evening lectures.
