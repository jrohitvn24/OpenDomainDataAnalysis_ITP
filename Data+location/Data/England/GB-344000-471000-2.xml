		<content>  More than half the area is tidal with
 salt marshes and deep channels. The   
 largest of these  is that of the river
 Kent which flows close to the         
 coastline. This channel changes course
 and in recent years has been moving   
 gradually from the Grange-over-Sands  
 side of the estuary towards the       
 Silverdale shore.Local folklore       
 maintains that this happens once in a 
 lifetime, and certainly this is being 
 borne out at the present time.        
 The tide may vary during the year from
 a neap of about 7 metres to a spring  
 of more than 10 metres. When the tide 
 is low one can see the embankment made
 over 100 years ago extending seawards 
 for half a mile from Jenny Brown's    
 Point using stone from the disused    
 quarry.                               
  The salt marshes are rich feeding    
 grounds for a large number of seabirds</content>
