		<content> The{ORIGINAL}school began life in{1880
 in a{VICTORIAN}building which was then
 on a quiet rural road.}Initially the  
 school taught pupils from{5-14}years. 
 In{1980}the school celebrated its{CEN-
{TENARY}though by then it was a{2}site 
 school.In{1972}a new and more{CENTRAL-
{LY}located school building was built. 
 For{13}years,however,the old building 
 continued accommodating the{INFANTS - 
{(pupils of 5-7)}a situation which con-
 cerned{PARENTS,TEACHERS &amp; GOVERNORS   
 because of the danger of{TRAFFIC.}Sad-
 ness mingled with relief,therefore in 
{JULY 1985}when after{105}years,the old
 building was finally closed and all of
 the infant children moved to the prem-
 ises with the{JUNIORS}(pupils{7-11).  
 The move became possible by the build-
 ing of{4}new classrooms on the{1972   
{SITE.}The school at present caters for
{207}pupils but increases are likely.  </content>
