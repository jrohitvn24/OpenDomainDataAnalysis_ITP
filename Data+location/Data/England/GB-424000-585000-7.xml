		<title>07Miners Strike.</title>
		<content>  A recent event which involved this   
 area was the miner's strike(April '84 
 to May '85).Ian Mcgregor visited      
 Ellington colliery and was knocked    
 over by protesting miners.Many people 
 argued that he was pushed,most thought
 that he tripped over a nearby fence.  
   Arthur Scargill (the head supporter 
 of the strike) held a rally in this   
 area which was a great success.       
   There is a NCB workshop and two     
 mines in this area(Ellington and      
 Lynemouth) that were affected.        
   The Deputies of these mines crossed 
 the picket lines with great difficulty
 ,to make sure that there were no      
 accidents in the empty mine           
 shafts.Many people in the surrounding 
 area thought that if the deputies     
 joined the miners strike it would have
 been settled at an earlier date.
