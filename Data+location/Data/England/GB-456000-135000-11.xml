		<content>{STREAMS}The candover Stream runs      
 through Northington, thence via the   
 River Arle into the River Itchen.     
 Water is taken from the river south of
 Winchester to supply Portsmouth.      
 Estimates of Portsmouth's water needs 
 by the end of the century required    
 increased water flow particularly in  
 dry summers. A scheme was devised and 
 installed whereby water could be      
 abstracted from underground reserves  
 by boreholes to the south of          
 Northington, piped down the valley    
 underground, and discharged into the  
 Candover Stream south of Northington  
 in order to supplement river flow when
 required.
