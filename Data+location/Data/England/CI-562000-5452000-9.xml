		<title>09The First Woman Constable</title>
		<content>      The island of Jersey is divided  
 into 12 parishes each with a constable
 (connetable) who is the civic head of 
 the parish, the leader of the Parish  
 Assembly and in charge of the Honorary
 Police. In an interview with the      
 children of the parish school, Mrs. Le
 Feuvre, the first woman connetable in 
 Jersey, said that she was proud to    
 hold the position and determined to   
 prove that a woman can perform the    
 task well. Her priorities are to      
 maintain the parish properties, which 
 she sees as a trust handed down from  
 former generations, and she hopes to  
 establish some sheltered accommodation
 for elderly parishoners who wish to   
 stay in St.Lawrence when their own    
 homes are no longer suitable for them.
 Mrs. Le Feuvre's aim is that people of
 all ages in the parish should feel    
 important and cared for.              </content>
