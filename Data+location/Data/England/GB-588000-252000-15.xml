		<title>15ANOTHER FAMILY WEEKEND  2</title>
		<content>This is Caroline Mills continuing an   
account of a family weekend.On Sundays 
we usually go to Cockfield Church      
because I am in the choir.My mum and   
older brother,Anthony,read the lessons.
When we get home from church about 11  
o'clock,the cleaning lady,mum and I    
have some coffee.Nick has orange       
squash.Then I phone up my friend or    
play with my brother.I normally phone  
my best friend Katherine.Sometimes we  
play with my rabbit Crystal or we play 
with Nick.At one o'clock we have lunch.
On Sundays people have a roast lunch.  
After lunch mum takes Katherine and me 
swimming to the Bury Sports Centre     
Swimming Pool.On the way home, we drop 
Katherine off and then go home for tea.
After tea I dry my hair.Then I go to   
bed.If I am lazy and don't get out of  
bed early enough,I miss my breakfast.
