		<title>16SITHNEY</title>
		<content> This small village is situated about  
 two miles north-west of Helston. It   
 grew up to accommodate and service the
{Carnmeal}miners. The name Sithney     
 originates from an Irish Saint called 
{Sethnie}. At one time a workhouse     
 existed in the village which housed   
 the very poor. A public house called  
{The Old Tree Inn}was established      
 during mining times and it thought    
 that the establishment of this public 
 house was used as an outlet for       
 locally{smuggled brandy.}             
                                       
        Today people in the village are
 either retired or work in the nearby  
 town of Helston.
