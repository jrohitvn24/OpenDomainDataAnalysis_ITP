		<title>17A FAVOURITE GAME.</title>
		<content>  My favourite game is a skipping game 
 called{"Mississippi".}Two people turn 
 the rope and two or more skip .One    
 person jumps into the rope and starts 
 to skip to the beat of the rhyme{"Its 
{up the Mississippi"}If you miss the   
 beat then you're out.There are certain
 actions to be do or else you are out ,
 When you are out you change places    
 with one of the people who have been  
 turning the rope.When the rhyme has   
 finished the person in the rope jumps 
 out and the next person jumps in,only 
 it must be on the beat or they are    
 out.The first word of the rhyme       
 changes to{"down"}then{"telephone"    
 then "pray",then "drive" and back to  
 "up".The rhyme is repeated over and   
 over until only one player remains in 
 the game.                             
   This skipping game played by        
 junior school girls in{Whickham.      </content>
