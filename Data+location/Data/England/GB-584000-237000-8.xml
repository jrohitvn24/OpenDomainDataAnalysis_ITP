 MIDDLETON IS A SMALL VILLAGE WITH A   
 DEFINITE NUCLEUS UNLIKE OST OF THE    
 OTHER VILLAGES IN THE AREA WHICH TEND 
 TO BE SCATTERED WITH SETTLEMENTS      
 AROUND MANOR HOUSES &amp; FARMS. BECAUSE  
 IT ADJOINS SUDBURY THERE HAS NOT BEEN 
 THE DROP IN POPULATION (157 IN        
 1981,183 IN 1871) THAT OTHER MORE     
 DISTANT AGRICULTURAL VILLAGES HAVE    
 UNDERGONE.A NUMBER OF HOUSES HAVE GONE
 UP SINCE THE WAR BUT NO ESTATES. THERE
 IS NO SHOP OR BUS SERVICE.THE         
 INHABITAMTS VERY MUCH RELY ON THEIR   
 CARS.FEW WERE BORN IN THE VILLAGE AND 
 MOST WORK ELSEWHERE.THE JOBS THAT     
 EXIST ARE ON THE FARMS AND IN THE     
 LARGE TURKEY PROCESSING PLANT.THE     
 CHURCH HAS A NUMBER OF NORMAN         
 FEATURES.THERE ARE GOOD VIEWS ACROSS  
 THE STOUR TO SUFFOLK.
