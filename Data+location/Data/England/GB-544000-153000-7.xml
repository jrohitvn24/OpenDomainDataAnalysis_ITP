		<title>07TOURIST SURVEY</title>
		<content> On Thursday,June 13th.1985 Class 2 of 
 Westerham C.E.Primary School conducted
 a survey of visitors to Westerham.    
 We interviewed 19 people from 7       
 different countries in half an hour.  
 The visitors came from Australia,North
 America,Europe and even the Sudan.    
 Most came by car, but one came by     
 bicycle. Most people were staying in  
 England for 3 weeks but one was       
 staying for a year.Some stayed in     
 Westerham for a few hours and some for
 3 days. Most came to see historic     
 buildings like Quebec House and       
 Chartwell. They also came to see the  
 antique shops. They thought the Green 
 was most pleasant but the town was    
 spoilt by traffic. More carparks and a
 by-pass would be helpful. However all 
 agreed that Westerham was a pleasant  
 place to visit.
