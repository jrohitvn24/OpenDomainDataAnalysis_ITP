		<content>   We had a lady to visit us who was   
 born in the village over 70 years ago.
 She said that there used to be 7 shops
 in the village. My house used to be a 
 sweet shop.There was also a           
 greengrocers and a bakery.            
   To keep themselves occupied they    
 went on long walks. They also played  
 hopscotch, hoops, and tops. You had to
 hit the top with a stick and a whip to
 keep it rolling along the road. The   
 vicarage used to be part of the old   
 needle industry.                      
  The first person in the village to   
 have a car was the doctor. Before that
 he had a motorcycle and sidecar.      
  At Christmas they had fruit in their 
 stockings, they didn't have many toys 
 at all.                               
  The books for children only had black
 and white pictures and they were      
 usually Fairy Stories.                </content>
