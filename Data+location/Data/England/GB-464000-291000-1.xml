		<content>  5GENERAL DESCRIPTION, FLECKNEY       
 This is an area of gently undulating  
 countryside with no special features. 
 The blockcontains the small village of
 Saddington and Smeeton Westerby, the  
 large village of Fleckney and part of 
 the much larger village of Kibworth.  
 The area is mainly agricultural       
 although there is some industry in    
 Fleckney and Kibworth.                
 Fleckney has grown rapidly over the   
 last few years with several new       
 housing and one industrial estate     
 being built.                          
 The farming is mainly mixed with the  
 growing of cereal crops and the       
 raising of livestock(cattle and       
 sheep).                               
 The block also contains most of       
 Saddington Reservoir, the largest     
 sheet of water in Leicestershire which
 was built to feed the nearby canal.   </content>
