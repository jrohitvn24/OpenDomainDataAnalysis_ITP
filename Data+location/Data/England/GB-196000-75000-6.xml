		<title>06The Buildings of Amble</title>
		<content> People have lived in the village of   
 Amble since{mediaeval times.}The      
 homes are clustered around the green  
 just above the old flood level of what
 was until the mid 1960's a tidal      
 tributary of the river Camel. The road
 bridge crossing the stream to Penpont 
 and beyond was rebuilt in 1937. In the
 village centre there was an old{black 
{smith's forge}which has recently been 
 turned into a craft shop. One of the  
{oldest cottages}in the village is the 
 other shop in Amble, it is the{local  
{Post Office}and general stores. In one
 part of the village green is a small, 
 low building where the villagers used 
 to keep their pigs many years ago.    
 Several of the houses are let to      
 tourists all year round, although the 
 majority are occupied by elderly or   
 retired people.The{old houses}of Amble
 are really charming.                  </content>
