		<content>I have my hair washed Wednesday and    
Saturday. I love to liie down on the   
edge of the bath and my mum will get a 
tel and put it under me and put some   
Timotei on my hair and scrub it in.    
But before she does that she wets it.  
When she scrubs my hair it hurts so I  
shout. And then she rinses it off and  
does the same again. Then she puts     
conditioner on and then I am done.     
When I have my hair cut my mum cuts it 
and when she puts the scissors in my   
head it hurts and I keep on telling her
when it is ready. She says " in five   
minutes" and when i look at my watch   
it's been twenty minutes.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
