In July 1985 there was a public meeting
called by the North West Water         
Authority to explain their plans for   
work on the Rowton to Abbeystead       
tunnel.They will be carrying out       
explosions to find out where the       
methane gas is coming from and how much
there is.A team of consultant          
geologists,scientists surveyors and    
contractors will spend about 10 weeks  
exploring the surrounding area.Shallow 
boreholes will be drilled and explosion
energy shot into the ground.           
      The Authority plan to keep the   
findings a secret as they hope to sell 
the information to interested people.  
This will help to pay for the survey   
and save money for the ratepayers.     
However they say they will tell local  
landowners and tenants if there are    
likely to be any health hazards.       </content>
