		<title>17Dishley Mill-N.W.Lough.</title>
		<content>{The Old Dishley Mill}is situated by   
 the{Black Brook,}Derby Road,North West
 Loughborough.It no longer functions as
 a mill,for the wheelhouse has been    
 removed and the building converted, in
 the early{1950s,}into a private home. 
 Some of the{grindstones}remain and are
 used as decorations.An old chimney,an 
 ornate front door and old Elizabethan 
 beams have also been retained.        
 The mill, dating back to the{sixteenth
 century,has had extensive alterations.
 The back wall has been knocked out and
 replaced with french windows,the drive
 is now set with pebbles and a large   
 swimming pool has been constructed in 
 the back garden.The adjoining pond has
 been drained.At one time the mill was 
 associated with{Robert Bakewell,}the  
 agricultural pioneer.Ducks frequent   
 the area and breed on the nearby banks
 of the brook.                         </content>
