		<content> The{Bung Chapel}was built in 1883 by  
 the Adams family for the workers in   
 the family brewery business. It was   
 built for services but was used for   
 many other things. On January 1st.    
 they dug the foundations of the       
 chapel, on May 2nd. the turret was    
 completed and the chapel was opened   
 and people sang and played instruments
 in there. If people did not go to the 
 services they lost their job. On the  
 walls of the chapel there are the     
 Adams family initials and two plaques 
 in memory of Thomas Francis{Adams}and 
 his wife Mary. The chapel was         
 re_erected and enlarged in 1902. Now  
 the Bung Chapel will be used as a     
 museum, opening in the Autumn, and all
 the people will be able to go there to
 see the exhibits from the Halstead    
 area.
