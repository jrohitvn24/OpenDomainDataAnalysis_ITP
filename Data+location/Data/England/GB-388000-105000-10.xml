{crimes for which people are arrested

{go out of the Police Station?}I have a
 role called Community Beat Officer.I'm
 the only one &amp; its only me who uses a 
 pedal cycle.I've got lots of          
 responsibilities,one is to schools &amp;  
 one is to people in the town.I try not
 to spend a whole day in the Station &amp; 
 balance my writing with time outside.{

{here?}No, not at all.
