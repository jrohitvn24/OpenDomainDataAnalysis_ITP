		<title>18Caving in Goatchurch Cavern.</title>
		<content> We walked up a shallow stream to the  
 cave entrance.We were wearing belts,  
 helmets,lamps and batteries.We looked 
 like miners.We looked after each other
 and moved along slowly.The caves were 
 formed by water erosion.We could see  
 higher cave entrances worn by earlier 
 water levels.We looked at and touched 
 the stalagmites and stalactites of    
 various shapes and sizes.Many long    
 ones had been broken off and removed  
 many years ago and so the cave is no  
 longer used by visitors.Many sea shell
 fossils were spotted.The csve had     
 probably been lived in and numberous  
 animal bones have been found.We went  
 to the end of the top level and       
 returned by the same route but other  
 more difficult routes with other exits
 exist.We thanked our guides Derek and 
 Michael Briggs.
