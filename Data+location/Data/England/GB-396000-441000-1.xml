		<title>01COWLING A MOORLAND VILLAGE 1</title>
		<content> The Parish of{COWLING}is situated near
 to the boundary between North         
 Yorkshire and Lancashire.Originally   
 made up of three early settlements    
 known as Cowling Hill,Stott Hill and  
 Ickornshaw,it was collectively known, 
 at the time of the{Domesday Book}as   
{Collinghe.}The entries state"In       
 Collinghe Roger P.2 carucates 2       
 bovates" "In Collinghe Archil had 2   
 carucates and 2 bovates".             
 For many years an industrial village  
 based on textiles,over the last twenty
 years radical changes have taken place
 as the textile industry has           
 contracted.Many small industries have 
 taken the place of the larger firms   
 which had offered employment          
 previously.Even farming,which had     
 played a very large part in the life  
 of the district,has changed.
