		<title>01Rawreth Area</title>
		<content> Our area,which lies between Rayleigh  
 and Wickford,consists mainly of arable
 farmland.In the centre is the village 
 of Rawreth,a community divided by the 
 A130 which runs from Chelmsford to    
 Southend.Rawreth is an old settlement,
 although probably post 1086 as it is  
 not mentioned in the original Doomsday
 Book.Plotland development in the early
 20th century has given Rawreth its    
 fragmented character.In the North,on  
 the River Crouch,Battlesbridge is well
 known locally for its antique shops   
 and stalls.To the West new housing at 
 Shotgate is encroaching on the        
 farmland,whilst to the East the       
 Rawreth Industrial Estate is being    
 developed.To the South are many ugly, 
 but necessary electricity pylons.     
 Interesting buildings include old     
 cottages at Battlesbridge,Rawreth     
 Church and thatched cottages.         </content>
