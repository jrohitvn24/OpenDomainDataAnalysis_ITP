		<content> The original mediaeval buildings of   
{Bradfield Manor}are still in          
 existence, and parts are now occupied 
 by the Branston family. The Great     
 Hall, now part of the living quarters,
 is reported to be haunted by a one    
 eyed monk, which has been seen by one 
 former owner of the property, and     
 whose "presence" was felt by at least 
 one visitor who had no previous       
 knowledge of the haunting.            
{ William Collingbourne,}who owned     
 Bradfield in the 15th century, is     
 reputed to be the author of the       
 derogatory line:-                     
{ "The Cat,the Rat,and Lovell our dog, 
  {Rule all England under the Hog."    
 He was executed in 1485 for his part  
 in an attempt to put Henry VII on the 
 throne in place of Richard III.       
  Bradfield is now a modern farm, using
 up-to-date methods and machinery.     </content>
