		<title>15SHUSTOKE RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>    There are two reservoirs at        
 Shustoke, a large "freshwater" pool   
 fed from the River Tame (90 acres     
 holding 422,000,000 gallons of water) 
 and a smaller settling pool (8 acres) 
 which is fed by the River Bourne. Both
 reservoirs are owned &amp; administered by
 the Seven Trent Water Authority and   
 supply drinking water to Nuneaton &amp;   
 part of Coventry.                     
    The large reservoir is used by the 
 Shustoke Sailing Club for yachting.   
    Both large &amp; small reservoirs are  
 leased by the Shustoke Flyfishers Ltd,
 who stock the water with Brown &amp;      
 Rainbow trout. The natural bottom of  
 the reservoir produces an abundance of
 aquatic fly life providing a natural  
 source of food. Shustoke trout are    
 renowned for their deep pink coloured 
 flesh &amp; for their excellent culinary  
 qualities.                            </content>
