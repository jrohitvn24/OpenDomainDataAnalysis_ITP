		<title>11Brixton School</title>
		<content> The school was built in 1843 and a    
 extra room added after the 1870       
 education act.In 1977 a temporary     
 classroom was added in an old garden. 
 In the main building are 3 main rooms.
 The hall is 9.3x5.8m and two          
 classrooms 6.5x5.5m The headmasters   
 house is attached to the school but is
 no longer occupied.It is used for a   
 headmasters office, resource room,    
 staff room / TV room / library and    
 stock room.The kitchen is used for our
 own cookery lessons and the bathroom  
 is a P.E store.We have a small        
 swimming pool.The toilets are out side
 in the yard.The play ground is on land
 owned by the village.The school was   
 founded by the church of England who  
 still own the building and appoint    
 some Governors.We hope to have a new  
 school in 1986.
