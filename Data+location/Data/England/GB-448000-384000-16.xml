		<title>16A Day in my life</title>
		<content> It was Saturday morning about 7.45. I 
 climbed out of bed,washed and dressed.
 I had my breakfast then took Boomer,my
 dog,for a walk. It was 8.30 when I got
 back. I called for Gaye and we went in
 the van to the stables.When we arrived
 we got the feeds ready. I fed Yorkie, 
 the calf, and then mucked out the     
{horses,}Fire and Barney, and filled   
 the haynets. First I groomed Barney,  
 then Fire. I rode Fire and jumped him.
 The highest jump was 3ft 9ins. After I
 had ridden Fire I took Barney on a    
 ride for two and a half hours. When I 
 got home I had my dinner and helped my
 mum then we went shopping. I got a new
 skirt,and top and some trainers. When 
 I got back I had my tea and then got  
 changed again to go to the stables. We
 bedded the horses down and fed the    
{calves.}I collected the eggs and put  
 the{chickens}away. Then I went home.  </content>
