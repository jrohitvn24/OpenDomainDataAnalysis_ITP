		<content> Transport facilities in the local area
 are of an excellent standard.  The    
 busses and trains run frequently and  
 efficiently.  the routs are vaired and
 even the small backstreets are covered
 by at least one bus per hour.  The    
 husses and trains run all over the    
 country from this area, and the prices
 are very good.  They are considered to
 be the cheapest rates in the whole of 
 England.  There are no bus stations in
 the area, but there is one at         
 Rotherham only a short distance away, 
 and there is a very well rquiped train
 station at mexborough.
