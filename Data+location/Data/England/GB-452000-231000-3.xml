		<title>03THE CHURCH COMMUNITY 1</title>
		<content> The Parish is on the southern boundary
 of the Diocese of Peterborough, and we
 share our Rector with Evenley.  At    
 present 9.30 Holy Communion services  
 are held on 2nd and 4th Sundays, with 
 Evensong at 6pm on those days; a      
 family service is held at 11am on 1st 
 Sundays, and Matins every 3rd.  A     
 Sunday School is held in the WI Hut   
 every Sunday at 11 am. Services are   
 not well attended at present.         
 Churchgoing appears to be a part of   
 village life which has lost its       
 importance.   Christmas, Harvest and  
 Easter do attract larger numbers.     
 Bell ringers pull weekly, and practice
 on Tuesdays. A recent influx of new   
 young ringers from the village has    
 assured the future of the band.  There
 is a five bell peal, last re-cast and 
 re-hung in 1923, after a fire, and    
 there is room for two more.           </content>
