		<title>08JERSEY MILK</title>
		<content>    Jersey's 4,200 milking cows provide
 the Island's co-operative dairy with  
 45,000 pints of milk each day. This is
 collected from the 145 dairy farms on 
 the Island.                           
    Once at the dairy (Jersey Milk     
 Marketing Board) the milk is treated  
 and fat separated. Seven different    
 types of milk are produced and        
 packaged in waxed cartons. Milk       
 bottles were last used in 1966. These 
 were stopped because they were        
 expensive and unhygienic.             
    Each week 21,000 cartons containing
 one third of a pint of milk are       
 delivered to the island's Primary     
 Schools.                              
    The cost of a 'Pinta' is 27p for   
 all the different types except "Full  
 Cream' which sells for 28p a pint.    
    Unsold milk is recycled into animal
 foods.                                </content>
