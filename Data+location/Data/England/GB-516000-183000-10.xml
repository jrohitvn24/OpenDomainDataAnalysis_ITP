   In our class I made a survey on     
 languages. I went round and asked the 
 children which language was {mostly   
{spoken at home between them and their 
{parents.}                             
                                       
   Nineteen people speak only English  
 at home,7 people speak Gujerati,      
 1 person only Bangla,1 person Punjabi,
 1 person Greek and 1 person Arabic.   
                                       
  This means that 11 people speak more 
 than 2 languages and some can read and
 write in them as well.                
                                       
  At our new secondary schools we will 
 have the opportunity to learn French, 
 German, Spanish or Gujerati.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
