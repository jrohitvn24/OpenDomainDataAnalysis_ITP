		<title>12CLUBS IN WARTON</title>
		<content> The Warton Institute provides a focal 
 point of village life. It caters for  
 all age groups. The Senior Citizens   
 form an active group which meets      
 weekly. Outings are organised         
 regularly. Various day and evening    
 classes are held there. They include  
 keep fit, dancing, needlework, etc.   
 The Womens' Institute meets           
 fortnightly. The youth club meets     
 twice weekly. The Warton drama group  
 rehearses weekly and stages its       
 productions there. A pre-school       
 playgroup is held on 4 mornings a     
 week and a mother and toddler group   
 meets weekly. Childrens' groups are   
 particularly active and include cubs, 
 scouts, brownies and guides. A Sunday 
 school is held at St Paul's church.   
 Bridges Playing Field is the venue for
 the local Cricket Club. A tennis club 
 used to meet here, but has ceased.    </content>
