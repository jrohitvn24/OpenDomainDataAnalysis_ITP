		<title>09THE SANKEY VALLEY PROJECT.</title>
		<content>     The Sankey Valley  project  that  
 stretches  from the Ship Inn  on the  
 A-58 to Carr Mill Dam, was  built in  
 1757 and  was  the  first  canal  in  
 Britain. Of the original network the  
 best  surviving  stretch  is  at      
 Bradleigh. This part of the canal was 
 constructed between 1755 and 1757.    
     Since 1979 the valley has matured 
 and  development  work  has  been     
 continuing between Carr Mill Dam and  
 Newton Brook. The park is laid out to 
 achieve a balance between  creating a 
 habitat for the rich  wildlife of the 
 valley and  conserving any  industrial
 remains  found along it.              
     Extensive  and  varied  footpaths 
 lead into a  wide range of landscapes 
 and habitats :-                       
 (woodland, meadow, canalside, ponds   
 and views out over farmland).
