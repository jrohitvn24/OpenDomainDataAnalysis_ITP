		<title>07HISTORY OF FRETTENHAM</title>
		<content>   We interviewied eight people about  
 the history of{Frettenham.}Only two of
 these were born there.                
   Hardly anyone could tell us any     
 history.                              
   One interviewee told us that        
 from an aircraft you can see part of a
 Roman road.  Boadicea camped on a     
 piece of land now used for horse      
 grazing near Buxton road .            
  {The Rose and Crown}public house got 
 its name from a plaque of the  rose of
 England.  Henry VIII had refreshments 
 there  on his way to see Anne Boleyn  
 at{Blickling Hall.                    
   Most people have not been living    
  in the village all their life, but   
 some people have. One person has lived
 in{Frettenham}for fifty one years and 
 knows a lot about Frettenham,his name 
 is Mr.Fisher.
