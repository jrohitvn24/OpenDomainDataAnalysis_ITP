		<title>01Elstead Village &amp; common</title>
		<content> Elstead village is basically a        
 commuter area as there is a very      
 limited amount of local employment, as
 transport is almost more existent in  
 the public sector. The total          
 population is approx. 2,600. The      
 nearest main shopping area is 6 miles 
 away where the majority of the people 
 who have private transport go to shop.
 The local shops although convenient   
 have most of their goods at higher    
 prices. The surrounding commons       
 although open to the public and have a
 high value of natural interest, are   
 used by the army for training,        
 especially by the Airbourne Divisions.
 Parts of the common are classed as bog
 land and are considered one of the    
 most interesting for flora &amp; fauna in 
 the country.
