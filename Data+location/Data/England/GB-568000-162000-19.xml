		<content>   Roman remains have been found on    
 both sides of the River Medway.A Roman
 villa is now being excavated at       
 Snodland. Many walls have been        
 uncovered and small items of interest 
 found.                                
   Evidence of burials have been found 
 locally .In 1954 a barrow known as    
 the Knob at Holborough was            
 investigated. Many of the interesting 
 finds are now kept at Maidstone       
 Museum.                               
  On the opposite bank of the river    
 other Roman finds include underground 
 storage tunnels at Burham and various 
 dwelling places.                      
   Finds from other periods are found

 Age skeleton was discovered in a chalk

 remains have also been unearthed at   
 different times in the locality.      </content>
