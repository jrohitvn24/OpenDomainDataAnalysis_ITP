		<content> The area contains 1st Shiplake Scout  
Group, whose headquarters are situated 
in Shiplake Rise, opposite the White   
Heart. The group was formed sixty years
ago.                                   
 HOUSING: The area contains a mixture  
of old and new housing and the         
restoration of the older houses has    
attracted many commuters to the village
who have tried to create an atmosphere 
separate to that of their working      
conditions.
