		<title>05TRADE NEW SUPERMARKET</title>
		<content> The main{trade}feature of{Ferndown}at 
 present is the development of a big{  
 new{Tesco Supermarket}and multi-storey
{car park,}being constructed by Taylor 
 Woodrow. I interviewed the Foreman and
 obtained the following information:   
 they started in September 1984 and    
 hope to be finished and opened by     
 November of this year (1985).  Mr     
 Symonns, the Foreman, said this would 
 be a good opening time because of     
 Christmas shoppers. The building      
 covers approximately 38,000 hectares, 
 the{library}occupying 1,500 hectares  
 of this. It took three years to obtain
 building permission. The whole project
 came about because the{Council}wanted 
 to make a more modern town centre for 
 Ferndown. They asked thirteen         
 architects to submit plans, chose the 
 best, and put the project into action.
