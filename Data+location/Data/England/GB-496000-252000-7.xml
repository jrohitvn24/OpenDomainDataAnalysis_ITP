		<content> There are approximately two hundred   
 and nine properties ranging from early
 "listed" buildings right through to   
 the latest timber frame construction. 
 Very few properties reflect the       
 owner's occupation.Those that do are  
 the public houses,the shop,the Manse  
 and the eight farms.An inn,the        
 vicarage,the bakery,the off-licence   
 and farm buildings have been converted
 to dwellings.Three farm houses are    
 very modern,the others are the        
 original buildings.There are seventeen
 bungalows,while the remaining         
 residences are two, three or more     
 bedroomed detached or semi-detached   
 residences.Accommodation available to 
 rent consists of four flats,five      
 alm-houses,eight council houses and   
 two other properties.One field and one
 plot have been sold for development.
