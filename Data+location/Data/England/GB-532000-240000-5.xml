		<title>05Changes in Royston</title>
		<content>   Royston has changed a lot during the
 twentieth century. The town has grown 
 in all directions and now is about    
 five times the size. Many of the open 
 fields have been built upon to make   
 new housing estates. Old paths and    
 country lanes have been made into big 
 roads and streets. There are lots of  
 new shops and schools. Tannery Drift  
 school is only 25 years old and Roysia
 school is only 10. Nearly all of the  
 old shops have been turned into new   
 ones. The old chalkpits, the workhouse
 and the brewery have gone, but Royston
 has an industrial estate where many   
 people work.                          
   Royston continues to change. Every  
 year some of the shops change and new 
 streets and houses are built. In 1980 
 a by-pass road was completed round the
 town.
