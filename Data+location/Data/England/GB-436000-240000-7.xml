		<content> I live in Shutford and get up at 7,   
 have breakfast and catch the school   
 bus at 8.15. We arrive at 8.30. School
 starts with assembly. Morning break is
 at 10.20 and lasts 20mins. I have     
 sandwiches at lunchtime and leave at  
 15.00. I get home at 15.30, watch TV  
 have tea play and go to bed at 21.00. 
                                       
 I get up at 6.45, have breakfast and  
 get my lunch and swimming things      
 ready. At 8.25 we go to school. In the
 morning I have a violin lesson. I am  
 working for grade 2. After that I go  
 swimming. I am working for the Dolphin
 amateur swimming award. I go home and 
 do my homework, violin practice, then 
 I go to tennis lessons at Warriner    
 Comprehensive school. The lessons are 
 an hour long. I watch a video, have   
 tea, watch TV and go to bed.
