		<content>{Sewage Works,(between Tollerton and   
{Cotgrave)}                            
 The purification plant near Cotgrave  
 is manned by 3 operatives who are also
 responsible for plants at Radcliffe   
 and Keyworth, and several pumping     
 stations. The sewage comes from       
 Cotgrave, Tollerton and Normanton on  
 the Wolds. - 150 litres per person per
 day, in total, two-thirds of a million
 gallons daily. There is little        
 industrial waste from the area, so 95%
 purification is achieved, to protect  
 fish life. The treatment process uses 
 biological filters, with naturally    
 grown bacterial culture reducing the  
 waste matter. Sludge collected from   
 the settlement tanks is distributed to
 local farms as a free service.
