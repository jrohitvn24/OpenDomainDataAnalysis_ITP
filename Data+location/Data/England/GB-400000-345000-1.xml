		<content>  This part of North Staffordshire lies
8 miles E of Stoke-on-Trent. Straddling
the beautiful, wooded Churnet valley,  
it flanks the Staffordshire Moorlands, 
the southern extension of the Pennines.
The soils are based on sandstone and   
some clays. The land is much better for
pasture than crops.                    
  Farming has always been important in 
the area. A number of old barns,       
cottages and farmhouses built from     
sandstone still survive. Some 200 years
ago mineral deposits in the Churnet    
valley became important, and gave rise 
to the copper industry which still     
exists at Froghall.                    
  In the 19th century many small coal  
mines existed round Kingsley, which    
expanded with short terraces of brick  
houses. Mining ceased years ago. Today 
many people live in Kingsley and       
commute into Stoke-on-Trent to work.   </content>
