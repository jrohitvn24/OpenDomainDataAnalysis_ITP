		<title>14 HOUSING TYPES</title>
		<content> First of all we made master copy of a 
survey sheet with columns to tick.We   
then had it photocopied,so we could all
have copies of it.Next we went out and 
started a walk through a part of       
Newmarket,a housing estate called      
Studlands Park and then through Exning.
On these sheets there were columns for 
different types of houses,ages of      
houses and what was used to build them.
We drew some rough sketches of some of 
the houses that we saw.                
 The most popular type of home in this 
area is terraces taking up 41% of the  
count,as they are less expensive to    
buy.Detached types come next with 22%. 
After this comes bungalows with 18%,   
then semi-detached with 15% and last of
all flats and maisonettes with 2% each.
This is because there is now room to   
build separate houses on the land.
