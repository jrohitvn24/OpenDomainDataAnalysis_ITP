		<content>Goudhurst is a healthy area with more  
people over the age of 60 than the     
average village, and an unusually high 
number over 75. The majority of these  
are caring for themselves. There is no 
old people's home nearby.  The closest 
one is Hartley House in Cranbrook. One 
Doctor has his surgery in Goudhurst and
runs a 'well-baby' clinic. In the      
church hall a Child Health Clinic with 
a health visitor in attendance takes   
place once a month. There is no        
dentist. Mrs. Sheila Klopper organises 
service called Goudhurst Ready-Call    
which is a good neighbour scheme with a
team of volunteers ready to help in any
way - transport for hospital visits or 
emergencies, sitting on helping with   
the elderly or children, and any social
need. The village is seen to be a      
caring one and many have benefitted    
from their help.                       </content>
