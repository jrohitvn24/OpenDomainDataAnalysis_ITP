		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO SWANMORE</title>
		<content> Swanmore is built in the middle of the
 country.  The atmosphere in Swanmore  
 is clean and never polluted.  There   
 are lots of fields and trees.  There  
 is even an apple orchard on the       
 Droxford road.  There are shops dotted
 around.  There are no major factories,
 just a very small one.  There are a   
 lot of houses in Swanmore, but that   
 doesn't spoil the village.  There are 
 two schools, one comprehensive and one
 primary.  There is a parish room and a
 big village hall and a scout hut.     
 There is a church and a chapel and    
 two vicarages.  Swanmore is a pleasant
 place.
