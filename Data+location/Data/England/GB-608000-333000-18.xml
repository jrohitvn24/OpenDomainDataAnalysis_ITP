		<title>18POPULATION OF EDGEFIELD</title>
		<content> The population statistics for         
 Edgefield show considerable variations
 and provide a sidelight on the        
 agricultural history of the area. Two 
 hundred years ago the area held nearly
 twice as many people, but in the      
 agricultural depression of the 19th   
 century many left to seek work        
 elsewhere. In the 1830s there was mass
 emigration to America: on one occasion
 a sixth of the total population went, 
 about 130 people. Some also went to   
 Australia, and recently a family now  
 living there has been trying to trace 
 descendants of the relatives left     
 behind 150 years ago. Now for the most
 part new people in the village tend to
 be pensioners, attracted by North     
 Norfolk's dry climate and its         
 reputation for long-lived inhabitants.
