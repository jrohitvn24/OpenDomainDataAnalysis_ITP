		<content> Instead of going from place to place  
 by{walking}or by{horse and cart}as    
 people did in the past, we would      
 probably go by {car, bicycle, bus,}or 
{train.}                               
 The only type of{roads}in our squares 
 are single{carriageway}or{estate roads
 where the speed limit is 30 or 40 M.P.
 H. The bus services are run by        
{Lincolnshire Road Car}and{Lincoln City
{Transport}who operate 9 buses through 
 squares 9469, 9470, 9569 and 1 bus    
 through square 9571. There are no bus 
 services in squares 9471 or 9570      
 because there are no roads or houses. 
 There are no bus stations in any of   
 the squares so all of the buses pass  
 through. Between 0700 and 2300 hours  
 about{105 buses}pass through the area,
 this means that there are about{6     
{buses}an hour in sqs. 9469,9470 and   
 9570.                                 </content>
