		<title>08FAMILY CARS IN DARLINGTON</title>
		<content> From a sample survey we found out that
 most of Darlington people have English
 cars.The most popular English car is  
 the Ford.The most popular foreign car 
 is the Fiat.                          
   In our area survey we found that    
 most people buy cars that are between 
 Â£3,000 to Â£8,ooo, but there are very  
 few who buy cars costing more than    
 Â£14,ooo.                              
   The Jaguar is the most expensive    
 English car.People like them but not  
 many people buy them because of their 
 price.They cost about Â£23,000.        
   A common family car would probably  
 have a petrol engine with a size of   
 about one and a half litres.Most cars 
 could fit about four or more people   
 in.The cars now are used for things   
 like shopping,travelling to work,or   
 sometimes to go on a weekend outing.
