		<title>14THE LOCAL POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> P.C. Pickering is the local policeman.
 He came to the school and told us     
 about the crime in Barling. In 1984   
 and 1985 there have been two          
 burglaries and one car stolen. He     
 thinks that teenagers  cause the most 
 trouble by writing on walls and       
 annoying people. Motorbikes,horses and
 dogs are also a nuisance. In two years
 one child has been injured on the     
 roads. P.C. Pickering  patrols the    
 village and visits the local schools. 
 He keeps in touch with the station by 
 radio. He travels by car or bike.
