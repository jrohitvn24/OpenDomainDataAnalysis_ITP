		<title>18CHANGE IN WILLINGDON</title>
		<content>   The Church Hall (built 1853) in     
 Church Street was the Village School  
 until a new Primary School was built  
 in Rapsons Road in 1952, also a       
 Secondary School in Broad Road. Lower 
 Willingdon had expanded in this       
 period. The majority of children now  
 live there, or in Polegate. The       
 Verger's House, adjoining the Church  
 Hall, was the headmaster's house.     
   The Primary School in Rapsons Road  
 was built on the site of a First World
 War Airship Station. An engineering   
 works next to the library in Coppice  
 Avenue remains from this; also, at    
 Donkey Hollow, a massive concrete slab
 with iron ring for tethering airships.
 ( not donkeys! )                      
   Haystoun House in Church Street was 
 originally a large private house. It  
 then became a home for the elderly. It
 is now a block of flats.              </content>
