		<title>15HOW I SPEND MY LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content>    In the summer months I go riding   
 with my friend. We go to riding school
 for a lesson once a week. I also enjoy
 roller skating with  my friends.      
    A lot of people in the village have
 horses and they go riding and hunting.
 Some people also go shooting or       
 fishing. Sometimes they use ferrets to
 hunt rabbits.                         
    I like going for walks across the  
 fields. We often see rabbits and      
 pheasants, lots of other animals,     
 birds and wild flowers. We go looking 
 for dens to use in the summer. Last   
 summer we had a den which was big     
 enough for about eight people. We     
 spent most of the summer holidays     
 playing there. I also made a den      
 inside our shed with deckchairs and a 
 table. We had picnics there.
