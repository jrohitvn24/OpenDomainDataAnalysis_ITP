		<content>  {St Martin's Church}is on the site of
 the Wyatt designed house. It was built
 at the turn of the century in part to 
 serve the village and the new house.  
 It was bought by the School after it  
 became a "redundant" church in the mid
 70s. It is now used by the School for 
 Sunday services which are optional for
 pupils. There are several memorials in
 the Church which is now dominated by a
 recently added organ in the crossing. 
 Recitals are given regularly.         
   Next to St Martin's, below the old  
 stable block, is{the 18th c. Chapel. }
 This is still owned by the Portmans,  
 and contains the family vault. It is  
 rarely used but is regularly heated.

 wine cellars.The Chaplain &amp; Assistant,
