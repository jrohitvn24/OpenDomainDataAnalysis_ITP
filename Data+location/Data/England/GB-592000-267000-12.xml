		<title>12Playground Game-Hot Rice</title>
		<content>  My  best play ground game is Hot     
Rice. You play Hot Rice like this:-    
there are two people "it" and the two  
people who are "it" have got to do     
this- they have to get you below the   
knee with a ball. They are not allowed 
to move with the ball .They have to    
throw the ball to each other. All the  
class like to play Hot Rice and my     
friend is hard to get but we get him   
in the end. When you are caught you    
put a coloured band on then you have   
to get the others who are not caught.I 
am always caught .The last two that    
are not caught are "it" the next time  
we play Hot rice .                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
