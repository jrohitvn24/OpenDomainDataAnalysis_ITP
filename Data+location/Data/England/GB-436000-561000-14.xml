		<title>14OUR YOUTH CLUB: SO.TYNESIDE</title>
		<content> Our Youth Club is held each Thursday  
 in St.Oswald's Roman Catholic Church  
 Hall. It is on for two hours, from 7pm
 till 9pm. Children between 9 and 16   
 years old can attend. It costs 10     
 pence if you are a member and 20p if  
 you are not. Non-members cannot attend
 until 7.30 pm.                        
  It is very popular because it is the 
 only one on the whole estate. Up to   
 100 children attend each session, and 
 ten adults look after them.           
  We do lots of interesting things,    
 such as playing table-tennis, darts or
 pool,using the space-invader          
 machine, or dancing. We have a        
 rounders team and a football team, and
 we are soon going to have a netball   
 team.
