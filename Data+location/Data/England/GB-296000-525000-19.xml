		<title>19SOUTHFIELD SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Southfield School is the only         
 secondary school in this area.It is a 
 comprehensive school taking pupils    
 from the age of 11. It is a new school
 having being formed as a result of    
 re-organisation of secondary schools  
 in West Cumbria in 1984. Infact it is 
 one of three secondary schools in     
 Workington,one of which is a Roman    
 Catholic school.                      
 The school has over 1000 pupils and   
 is housed on a split site made up of  
 two former schools in the area.The two
 buildings are not far                 
 apart,(approximately 400m),and the    
 upper school site is situated right   
 next to the Moorclose leisure centre. 
 Southfield School shares a sixth form 
 with Stainburn School and eventually  
 the sixth form will have their own    
 seperate building.
