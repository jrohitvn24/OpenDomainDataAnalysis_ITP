		<title>16A TEENAGERS DAY</title>
		<content>     Today is a typical Monday. My     
 alarm goes off at 6.00am., I arise    
 at 6.15.  I have to wear a school     
 uniform, this is a white blouse &amp;     
 socks, a grey skirt &amp; jumper and a    
 red,grey &amp; black tie.   When I am     
 dressed I have breakfast.  This is    
 usually a cereal i.e. Shredded Wheat. 
 After breakfast I usually watch a     
 video of a film that was shown the    
 night before or maybe Breakfast TV.   
   At 8.00am the school coach arrives  
 and I depart from Tewin to school.    
 At 8.50 school starts.  First we go to
 our tutor rooms to be registered and  
 then we go into assembly.             
   I have Art for the first 2 lessons  
 and then it is break which I usually  
 spend around the Music Block.  After  
 break it is P.E. followed by Science. 
 After these lessons it is time for our
 dinner break.--continued---           </content>
