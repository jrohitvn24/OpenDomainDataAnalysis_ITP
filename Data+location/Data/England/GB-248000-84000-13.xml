		<title>13HOUSING IN LYDFORD</title>
		<content> In Lydford we have quite a modern     
 housing estate of bungalows and people
 who live there are mainly retired.    
 There are about eighteen bungalows on 
 Hawthorn Park estate.In Lydford there 
 is a Terrace called Prince Charles    
 Terrace and there are four houses     
 there.There are some more houses      
 down Silver Street and these houses   
 are called Post War Council houses and
 they are older then Hawthorn Park     
 estate. Most of the other houses in   
 Lydford are lot older then the        
 estates.These older houses are built  
 of local stone with slate roofs. There
 are no thatched houses now but some of
 the houses were thatched many years   
 ago. Lydford is in the Dartmoor       
 National Park and a few years ago all 
 the telephone lines were put under    
 ground.                               
                                       </content>
