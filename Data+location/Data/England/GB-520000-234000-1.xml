		<title>01St.Nicholas' Church, Norton</title>
		<content> St.Nicholas' is a small church in     
 Norton village, in the diocese of     
 St.Albans,which still is used today.It
 is about nine hundred years old,the   
 Domesday book mentions a priest at    
 Norton.The tower was built eight feet 
 away from the church.In 1453 when the 
 tower was finished the nave was then  
 lengthened to join the tower,giving   
 more than 3.6 m. extra space.         
 There is a peal of eight bells which  
 are still rung today,by the Norton    
 guild of bell ringers for family      
 services and Sunday services.The old  
 north door is now blocked up so the   
 southerly door is now used.The church 
 is a quiet and tranquil place.The     
 oldest of the pews being at least     
 four hundred years old.Having been    
 cared for the church may stand for a  
 further nine centuries.
