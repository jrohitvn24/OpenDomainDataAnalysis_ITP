		<title>11THE HUNDRED HOUSE</title>
		<content> The present building dates back to the
 18th century when it was built by Lord
 Foley to cater for the many visitors  
 to the village with the expansion of  
 Witley Court. It stands at the        
 junction of roads to Worcester,Tenbury
 Droitwich,Bromyard,Stourport and      
 Kidderminster and so was a busy       
 staging post. The hotel today is not  
 residential. There is a large         
 restaurant which is open every evening
 and bar snacks are available in the   
 lounge at lunchtime.Summer barbecues  
 are held weather permitting. Regular  
 entertainments are a Jazz evening, a  
 Hawaiian evening and a Country and    
 Western evening.The Farm Machinery    
 Society and the Shooting Club meet    
 there at regular intervals. The dining
 room has been recently extended and   
 there are plans for further extensions
 to the restaurant.                    </content>
