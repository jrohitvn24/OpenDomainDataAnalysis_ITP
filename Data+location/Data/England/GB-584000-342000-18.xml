		<content> In School on the playground we play   
 hopscotch.  In hopscotch the numbers  
 are from one to eight and you have to 
 throw a stone and whichever number it 
 lands on you jump and hop to it.  You 
 pick up the stone and jump and hop    
 back again.  We skip as well and there
 is a game called H.E.L.P.  You skip to
 the letters H.E.L.P. until you are    
 tired.  H stands for High Water, E    
 stands for Easy, L stands for Leap    
 Frog and P stands for fast.  If       
 someone lands on H the other person   
 has to have the rope high.  Another   
 game is called Bulldog when there are 
 two homes and you have to run to one  
 of them.  The last person is 'it' and 
 they have to be 'it' if they hit      
 someone else.  They have to make      
 everybody 'it' and the one who does   
 not get 'it' is the fastest runner.
