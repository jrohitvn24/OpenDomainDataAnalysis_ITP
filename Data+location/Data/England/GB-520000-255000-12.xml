		<title>12Abbotsley Church.</title>
		<content> Abbotsley church started its life in  
 1138, and is dedicated to St Margaret 
 of Antioch.There are 4 kings on the   
 corners of the parapet on the tower.  
 These figures are about 16th century  
 and are supposed to be Macbeth,       
 Malcolm, Harold and William, and      
 people say,that two of the kings heads
 fell off and the men put them on      
 the wrong  bodies. There are five     
 bells in the tower and out of the     
 five, two are in working order.The    
 church has been restored by the       
 redundant church commissioners. So now
 we use only part of it for services   
 every Sunday,but if it is an important
 service then we ask permission  and   
 can use the nave as well.The church is
 surrounded by a churchyard which has  
 some old graves dating back to around 
 about the 1630's.
