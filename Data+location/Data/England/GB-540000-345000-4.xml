		<title>04The Primary School,Leverton</title>
		<content> Our school was built in{1873 }and     
 opened with one teacher and a helper. 
 We now have 24 children,11 girls      
 and 13 boys,aged from 5 to 11 and two 
 teachers,{Mr.Ditchburn,the headteacher
  and{Mrs.Fletcher.}The school is one  
 of the oldest buildings in Leverton   
 because, apart from the church,there  
 is only one other building more than  
 200 years old.The school is a typical 
 Victorian building which has been     
 altered over the years to make it     
 warmer,lighter and leak-proof but you 
 can still see traces of the old       
 windows and doors. Until the building 
 of the local secondary school in the  
 1960's children used to stay at       
 Leverton School until they were old   
 enough to leave to go to work.Most    
 children cycle to school,a few walk   
 and some come by car especially when  
 it rains.                             </content>
