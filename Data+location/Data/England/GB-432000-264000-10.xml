		<title>10PUBS AND ENTERTAINMENT.</title>
		<content>   The main idea of a public house is  
 to sell drinks to the public, but we  
 found that most pubs offer a lot more 
 than drinks. Not only do people go to 
 pubs for a drink, but also for social 
 meetings.                             
   In a survey of six pubs, we         
 discovered that most of the pubs had  
 darts and pool tables and very often  
 darts and pool teams.                 
   In a survey of these six pubs all of
 them had at least three of the        
 following entertainments:-            
                                       
   jukebox                garden       
   pool/snooker table     darts board  
   fruit machines         darts team   
   live music             other teams  
                                       
   Live music appeared to be unpopular,
 but juke boxes were very common.
