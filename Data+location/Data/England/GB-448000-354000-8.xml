		<title>08A Cottage,Kirkby</title>
		<content>    My cottage was made by the Duke of 
 Portland for his farmers.             
    We have three downstairs rooms.    
 Each room was used as a house for     
 farmers with ten or so children.   The
 kitchen used to be a stable.   It has 
 a pine dresser.   The china tea       
 service in it has a flowery pattern.  
    In the dining room there's a       
 granddaughter clock with a carved     
 pattern on the top.  The room is green
 and dark pink.   We have a french     
 window leading to the garden.         
    The front room is beige and green. 
 On the oak mantlepiece stand an       
 elephant and an ashtray with a moulded
 dog's head.                           
    My bedroomm has cottage style      
 curtains.   When you have the window  
 open it's like being in a meadow      
 because there's flowers on the        
 wallpaper.                            </content>
