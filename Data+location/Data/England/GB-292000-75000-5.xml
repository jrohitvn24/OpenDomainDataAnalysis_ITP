 inviting to the tourist. It has a     
 beautiful setting with the river      
 running down through the center  to   
 the sea. Dawlish is famous for its

 and also other birds. A chart         
 describing the birds inhabiting the   
 area is displayed. Dawlish Lawn

 events, during the summer Rotary      
 Fayre, Flower Show, Church Fetes to   
 name a few. There is also  a band     
 stand which is  used for live
