		<title>06FARMING: LOVERSTONE FARM</title>
		<content>     Loverstone was in the original    
{Domesday Book.}This arable farm is now
 owned by Mrs.Henton. Since the death  
 of Mr.Henton,{Henton's Building       
{Firm,}based at the farm, has been run 
 down.                                 
     Most of the machinery and         
 materials was sold off at an auction  
 recently leaving just a couple of     
 benches, a circular saw, planer /     
 thicknesser and a pillar drill. These 
 are to remain as a service to some of 
 the local craftsmen who have used the 
 workshop as past employees and who now
 make windows and similar items for    
 home improvements.                    
     The big barn / workshop has been  
 full of hand and machine tools which  
 have been used for generations. The   
 Blacksmith's Forge now stands idle and
 outside in the yard the old pond has  
 been filled in.                       </content>
