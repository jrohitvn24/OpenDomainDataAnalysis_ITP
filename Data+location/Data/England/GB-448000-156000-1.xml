		<title>01SYDMONTON IN GENERAL</title>
		<content> SYDMONTON IN 1985 IS A VERY RURAL     
 AREA. THE MAIN ACTIVITY IS FARMING.   
 THIS FARMING IS VERY COST CONSCIOUS.  
 HALF THE FARMING LAND IS OWNED BY     
 PRUDENTIAL ASSURANCE AS INVESTMENT. IT
 IS MAINLY ARABLE &amp; MANAGED IN LARGE   
 UNITS WHICH HAVE BEEN FORMED BY       
 GROUPING SEVERAL SMALLER FIELDS       
 TOGETHER. THIS HAS HAD SEVERAL        
 EFFECTS: MANY PUBLIC FOOTPATHS ARE    
 OVERGROWN; FEW DWELLINGS ARE OCCUPIED 
 BY PEOPLE WORKING ON THE LAND. INDEED,
 MANY FORMER TIED COTTAGES ARE OWNED BY
 PEOPLE WHO WORK OUT OF THE AREA.      
                                       
 SYDMONTON HAS FREQUENT VISITORS       
 BECAUSE THE DOWNS ARE ATTRACTIVE      
 RECREATIONAL AREAS, BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO
 LIVE HERE, THERE ARE VERY FEW         
 AMENITIES. THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL OUT OF 
 THE AREA FOR WORK, SCHOOL, MEDICAL    
 ATTENTION &amp; ENTERTAINMENT.            </content>
