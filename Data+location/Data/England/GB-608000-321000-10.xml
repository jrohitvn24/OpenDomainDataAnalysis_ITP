 I learnt that the people in my class  
 like pets and only a few people don't 
 have pets. The most popular pets were 
 cats and then came dogs.The most      
 common colours for cats are black,    
 white, ginger and grey. Dogs and cats 
 are kept in boxes and baskets with    
 blankets, pillows and straw bedding.  
 The most common dogs are black        
 Labradors. Spaniels, Jack Russels,    
 Sheep dogs and Yorkshire Terriers are 
 less popular. Other pets are Hamsters,
 Goldfish, Pigions, Canaries,Tortoises,
 Goats, Geese, Budgerigars, Hens,      
 Guineapigs, Ducks, Rabbits and        
 Gerbils.                              
  Reepham is a good place to have pets 
 like cats and dogs because most people
 have big gardens and there is a lot of
 country-side around Reepham where you 
 can take your dog for a walk.         </content>
