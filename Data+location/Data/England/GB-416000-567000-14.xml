		<content>   Permed hair is one of the most      
 fashionable styles of today.  The     
 boys' hairstyle is permed all over or 
 just at the back.  The girls'         
 hairstyles are wavy, permed all over  
 or just on the top.                   
   Girls' fashion in clothes is a tight
 skirt with a split up the back and a  
 baggy top with a T-shirt underneath,  
 with a thick belt.  The boys' fashion 
 is tight jeans with a kappa coat which
 is waterproof.                        
   Trainers are the fashion in shoes   
 for boys with a pod man (a piece of   
 leather with a picture on it) which is
 attached to the shoe.  The girls'     
 fashion in shoes is pod shoes and also
 high-heeled shoes.                    
   The girls' fashion in earrings is   
 round, big and dangly earrings, while 
 boys wear one or more gold studs in   
 one ear.                              </content>
