		<title>16 John Whites Sports Ground</title>
		<content>  John Whites is a private sports      
ground on the edge of Rushden; it is   
linked with a famous shoe factory. It  
was once two farms until John White    
bought it to build a house, however he 
built it elsewhere.                    
  He decided to turn the 11 acres into 
a sports ground with golf, bowls,      
tennis and a club house, which holds   
about 90 people. To become a member    
you pay a membership fee.              
  At the ground, golf seems to be the  
most popular game and is played all the
year through. Bowls is also a popular  
sport, the season lasting from May to  
September (you need plenty of skill and
practice to play it). Tennis is not    
popular at all. The groundsman is proud
of his ground and looks after it well.
