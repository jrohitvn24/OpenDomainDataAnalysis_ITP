       At Hartswood Manor Pheasantry   
 which belongs to Charrington's the    
 brewers, there are 1700 pheasants.The 
 gamekeeper hopes to shoot 1000        
 pheasants this year.The mainly        
 deciduous woodland in this area is    
 good cover for the pheasants because  
 it has tall trees for them to roost in
 and mainly brambles to hide in.       
       The gamekeeper takes the        
 pheasants' eggs and his chickens hatch
 them.                                 
       The gamekeeper had recently seen
 poachers snooping around using the    
 lamping method to poach.This involves 
 bringing a powerful lamp and shining  
 it in the pheasants' eyes.Because they
 are blinded by the light they do not  
 move and the poachers steal them.     
      Each pheasant costs Â£5 to prepare
 for shooting.                         </content>
