		<title>08MY HOUSE IN WIS. GREEN</title>
		<content> We have ten rooms in our house. The   
 living room has a T.V. The dining room
 is next to the living room. We have   
 two tables for eating. The big table  
 is for parties and Christmas and is in
 the dining room. The small table is in
 the kitchen. We nearly always have our
 food in the kitchen. We have a larder 
 that has four shelves full of food and
 little shelves for food and drink. We 
 have a fridge and a freezer, a cooker 
 and a washing machine.                
       My brother and I have separate  
 bedrooms. My room has a chest of      
 drawers and a wardrobe for my clothes.
 Sometimes our cat, Mogford, sleeps in 
 the wardrobe. We have an attic for the
 stuff we do not use anymore. Our car  
 is kept in a li
