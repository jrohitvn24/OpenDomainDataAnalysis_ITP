		<content>         Carr Bridge Field             
 This children's  playing field is     
 situated off Barnsley Road,in Ackworth
 It is called Carr Bridge.In the       
 adventure play-ground there are       
 swings,including baby swings,a        
 roundabout,a see-saw and a slide which
 is built on a slope.Also in the play- 
 ground are some constructions of wood 
 which have poles so children can slide
 down them.This is not finished but it 
 is supposed to be finished sometime in
 August 1985.Also in this park there   
 are a couple of goal posts,but when   
 the football season has finished the  
 posts are taken down.Also near the    
 park is a newly built school called   
 Mill Dam,it is for young children from
 the age of five to nine years of age.
