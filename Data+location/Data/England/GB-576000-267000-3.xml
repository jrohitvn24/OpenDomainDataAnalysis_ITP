  Lifelong Resident: "I remember them  
big old rotary ploughs coming to the   
Heath.We used to go out there and watch
them.Big as this classroom they were   
and they used to grind round and round 
in the ground and get down really deep.
And the rabbits-you should have seen   
them run."                             
                                       
        "Roger G. farms it now.His dad 
had the Heath ploughed.Fords used to   
try out their tractors as a            
demonstration to local farmers.They    
used to come to see them in action and 
that way he got it all ploughed.He was 
a good farmer.See the corn there now."
