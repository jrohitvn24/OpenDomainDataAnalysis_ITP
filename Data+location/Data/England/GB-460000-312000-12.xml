		<title>12Mr Marney the naturalist</title>
		<content> During the visit of Mr Marney         
 Katherine Porter said that she lived  
 on a farm and had an unused barn.So he
 thought that he could release 4 barn  
 owls in the barn,if we could design   
 suitable cages.                       
          Cages                        
 We made the cages out of              
 leather,nails,wood and wire.First of  
 all we had to measure up the wood and 
 make the frames.We had to make        
 them properly for they all had to fit 
 together.We had to use square wire so 
 that it would'nt damage the owls      
 wings.Leather made a perfect hinge.The
 cages were split in to 3 parts,2 for  
 the owls ,1 for safety.
