		<title>04THE AVENUES, BENTLEY</title>
		<content> The approach to the church of         
 St Mary                               
 is through a short avenue of ancient  
 yew trees. The two nearest the church 
 have been cut down whilst conducting  
 this survey. When seen by Gilbert     
 White in 1793 they were then thought  
 to be between 200 and 300 years old.  
 Their age and the spread of their     
 lower branches being so great and so  
 heavy they are now supported by an    
 arbour like structure of heavy        
 timbers.                              
                                       
 The avenue of lime trees leading from 
 the church to Bury Court were planted 
 early in the 19C. and are a most      
 magnificent sight.                    
                                       
 Dutch elm disease decimated one other 
 fine avenue which has now been totally
 removed.                              </content>
