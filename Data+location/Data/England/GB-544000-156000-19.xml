		<title>19Knockholt and its Services</title>
		<content> Knockholt shares a Rector with a      
 neighbouring village, Halstead. This  
 is a new innovation and initially was 
 not popular but is now working well.  
 It is a very caring and public        
 -spirited  village. Some years ago    
 Knockholt fought to be allowed to stay
 in the Sevenoak district instead of   
 becoming part of Bromley and Greater  
 London. Thousands of pounds were      
 raised and eventually Knockholt was   
 allowed to have its way and remain a  
 country village instead of becoming   
 part of London's overspill. The       
 village also fought against planning  
 application for a loacl zoo and again 
 won its case. Planning applications   
 are all thoroughly perused and great  
 interest is taken in all matters      
 concerning the village. At present the
 Knockholt Society is fighting proposed
 provision of gypsy sites in the area. </content>
