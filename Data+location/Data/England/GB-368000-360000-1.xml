 The land is flat and gently rolling   
 with the general slope of the land    
 being from South East to North        
 West.The soil is mainly glacial       
 clay. One badly polluted main stream  
 ,the{River Wheelock,}flows through the
 village.It does not support           
 fish because of industrial and        
 agricultural pollution.The other main 
 water system is the {Flashes}.These   
 are long narrow lakes formed when land
 subsided above emptied brine streams. 
 They are slowly growing in length and 
 width.They now run North to South     
 along the entire Eastern edge of the  
 block except between Crabmill and     
 Green Lanes.The Flashes support much  
 wild life.e.g.Swan mussels,fish,birds,
 plants and insects.There are about 210
 manmade and natural {ponds}in the area
 .The number varies according to season</content>
