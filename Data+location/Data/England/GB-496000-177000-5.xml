		<content> "Come friendly bombs and fall on      
 Slough" says Sir John Betjeman's      
 famous poem.Very few bombs fell on    
 Slough and it is still much as he saw 
 it.People in Slough think the poem    
 unfair. There are plenty of fields,   
 parks and green places,like Upton Park
 and Herschel Park.There isn't much    
 pollution now as the factories are    
 modern and use electricity.           
  But people agree that the streets are
 crowded and depressing.There are many 
 shops and a shopping precinct .The    
 centre of the High Street has been    
 re-paved and made traffic free and the
 precinct is being refurbished.This    
 should make it a lot more pleasant.   
  The traffic through the town is not  
 so heavy now the M4 motorway has      
 opened.
