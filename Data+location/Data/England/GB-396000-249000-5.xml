		<content>   At the present time there are few   
 people out of work in the village.    
   Most women work either full or part 
 time, helping in a family business or 
 as a teacher or part-time office      
 staff. Very few women are full-time   
 housewives, in fact 90% of women with 
 children of playgroup age supplement  
 the family income.                    
   Several men are self-employed others
 represent companies around the UK.    
 Most men work in the surrounding towns
 of Worcester, Birmingham and Redditch 
 and the Midlands, consequently most   
 travel some distance to their work. In
 fact 98% of people interviewed        
 travelled more than 5 miles.          
   About 4% of the population work on  
 the land because this is a rural area.
   There are no big factories or major 
 employers in the immediate area so few
 people work at the same location.     </content>
