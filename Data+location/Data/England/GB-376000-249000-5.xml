 In Leigh Sinton there are eight       
 industries. A main industry is        
 farming.                              
 Its main produce is Eggs from Beards, 
 Apples from Norburys, Christmas trees 
 from Leigh Sinton Farms and           
 strawberries from Montandons.The      
    other industries are the old       
 wheelwright's shop,a forge and a      
 haulage firm.There are two garages,one
 has a room for spraying,an office and 
 a workshop for preparing cars for the 
 M.O.T test.The Haulage firm carries   
 fruit mostly and is involved in       
 operations all over the country.In the
 summer there are many pickers to be   
 seen on the fields and in the autumn  
 the hopfields are just as populated.In
 the days before christmas many cars   
 can be seen carrying away their trees 
 for the coming celebrations.          </content>
