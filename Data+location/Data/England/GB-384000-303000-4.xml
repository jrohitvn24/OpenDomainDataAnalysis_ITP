		<title>04Survey of Parents in Codsall</title>
		<content>We asked the parents of Codsall Middle 
School children to state the buildings 
they considered to be most and least   
attractive. The Parish Church of St.   
Nicholas came out easily on top as the 
most attractive building while the     
South Staffordshire District Council   
Offices topped the poll as least       
attractive. (It was also some parents' 
most attractive building ) Some groups 
of shops,at Birches Bridge and in      
Codsall Square were also deemed        
unattractive. Many memories of local   
events were recalled,especially the    
street parties connected with Her      
Majesty's Silver Jubilee in l978 and   
Prince Charles' wedding in 1982. Other 
local memories were of the winning of  
"Best Kept Village" Competitions and   
the closure, in 1983, of Histon's Hill 
First School.
