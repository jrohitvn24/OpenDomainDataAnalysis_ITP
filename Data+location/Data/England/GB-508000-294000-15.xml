		<title>15HIGH LEYS FARM:NORTH/ELTON</title>
		<content> A 300 acre farm of mixed arable land. 
 The family consisted of farmer, wife  
 and two young children living in      
 modern detached house, owner occupied.
 The farmer had lived there for 31     
 years, was born in area, as were his  
 parents.  Casual labour was employed  
 at harvest and when required.  He     
 owned two cars, shopped in Stamford   
 and Peterborough and children taken by
 car to school in Oundle.  Main leisure
 pursuits were television and reading. 
 They took a daily newspaper. They     
 enjoyed living there because it       
 combined country living with easy     
 access to good amenities. The only    
 disadvantage was the close proximity  
 of Sibson Airfield which they found   
 disturbing, particularly at week-ends.
