		<title>05THE MARINE LAKE AND GROUNDS</title>
		<content> In our block there was a spacious     
 park,there were swings,a round-about  
 and also a lake inhabited by ducks    
 mainly mallards,and blackheaded gulls.
 There were two hockey pitches,tennis  
 courts and a bowling green. In the    
 play area there were junior swings and
 infant swings.There was a fairly big  
 slide,but unfortunately people had    
 been climbing{up}the slide.Also on the
 round-about and other areas of the    
 park there were pieces of graffiti.It 
 is an ideal place for the elderly to  
 take their dogs for a walk.It could   
 also be relaxing for some people just 
 to sit on a bench and feed the        
 ducks.What I thought was strange was  
 that the kiosk  which usually sells   
 ice-creams and drinks was not open,but
 it was{November!}According to some    
 children the kiosk was only open on   
 weekends.    {PAUL KITCHEN            </content>
