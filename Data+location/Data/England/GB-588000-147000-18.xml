		<title>18Life in Egerton _ one view</title>
		<content>   As I write this my cats are sitting 
 near me, logs from my orchard burn on 
 the fire, and there is fruit and      
 goat's milk of my own producing in my 
 kitchen.  This, in part at least, is  
 what living in Egerton means to me.   
   Egerton is still a village          
 community.  Many of my friends have   
 come to the village fairly recently   
 but the core of the village is based  
 on families who have been here for    
 generationa,  This is important to me 
 as much as to Egerton.                
   Closely controlled planning and a   
 reasonably healthy supply of local    
 employment, much of it related to     
 agriculture, will help to ensure it   
 remains so.                           
   The church communities in the vill_ 
 age are a drawing together of old and 
 new inhabitants, providing for me a   
 sense of continuity and support.      </content>
