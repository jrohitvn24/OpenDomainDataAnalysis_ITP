		<title>13Housing In High Park</title>
		<content>  In our area there are three types of 
 housing and most of the houses are    
 over 100 years old.Most of them are   
 semi-detached,brick-built,            
 slate-roofed and two storey. Many of  
 them have had their sash windows      
 replaced by double-glazing.These      
 houses are mostly privately owned.    
 Secondly, there is an entire street of
 about sixty prefabs.The walls are wood
 and concrete, the roofs are           
 corrugated asbestos and they are all  
 bungalows built in 1941 for Liverpool 
 evacuees. They were intended to last  
 20 years, but are still rented and    
 lived in.The newest houses were built 
 by the council in the 1950's. They are
 mainly semi's with a few terraces.They
 are brick-built with tiled roofs and  
 are rented.
