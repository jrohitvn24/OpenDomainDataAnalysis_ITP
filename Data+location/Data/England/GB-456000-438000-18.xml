 few shops and a number of mobile      
 services travel round to serve the    
 community.  The library van calls in  
 Kelfield once a fortnight, in         
 Stillingfleet once a week.  A bread   
 man delivers in Stillingfleet three   
 times a week, Kelfield twice.         
 Northern Dairies deliver milk and     
 cream, door to door, every day.They   
 also carry orange juice,bread, butter,
 eggs and potatoes.{                   
{ Kelfield also has a mobile wet fish  
{van, a fruit &amp; vegetable van, and a   
{fish and chip van calling once a      
{week.A mobile hairdresser calls by    
{appointment. In Kelfield also a local 
{woman cycles round morning and night  
{delivering newspapers.}

 runs a chiropody unit which visits    
 Stillingfleet every three months.     </content>
