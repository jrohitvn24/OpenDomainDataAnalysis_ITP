		<title>12PRESTON HEALTH AUTHORITY</title>
		<content>    This is the district headquarters  
 of Preston Area Health Authority. It  
 is decided here how many doctors,     
 nurses and other medical staff are    
 needed in Preston, and how much money 
 is needed. About 300 people work here,
 most of whom live in Preston. The     
 building is known as the Workhouse to 
 the elderly, the Civic Hostel by the  
 middle aged, and is now officialy the 
 D.H.Q. These names show what it has   
 been used for. It is very large, about
 150 metres long and 4 stories high.   
 There are 135 windows in the Watling  
 St. Road side. Underneath is a dark   
 tunnel where tramps and people who had
 to be punished were put. Recently the 
 Nurses Training School has moved into 
 the D.H.Q. Up to 100 nurses spend six 
 weeks in the school and most of them  
 go to the Royal Preston Hospital.
