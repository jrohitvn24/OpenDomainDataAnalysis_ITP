		<title>03Dundale School Fire</title>
		<content> Dundale's head teacher, Mrs June Ward,
 said she belived the school was lucky 
 to get away without damage to any     
 classrooms, "We were very lucky",she  
 said on Monday, "in another 20 minutes
 the building would have burnt down".  
 Thanks to the quick action of the     
 firemen who brought the blaze under   
 control in about 15 minutes, damage   
 was confined to outside walls and     
 glass in a door and windows.
