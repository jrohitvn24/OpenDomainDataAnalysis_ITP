		<title>12The Herts Advertiser (contd)</title>
		<content> I analysed a copy of The Herts        
 Advertiser dated June 29th 1985. The  
 newspaper had 56 pages. 15 pages      
 contained general news stories, there 
 were 3 pages of sport, a women's page 
 and a children's page. There were also
 Letters to the Editor, Births, Deaths 
 and Marriages, TV and Cinema guide,   
 and Entertainments. There were 27     
 pages of adverts, eg cars for sale,   
 pest control, replacement windscreens,
 videos, and 4 pages of property for   
 sale (houses, shops etc.). There were 
 7 pages of job vacancies. The main    
 news stories concerned the activities 
 of animal liberation groups, the      
 centenary of The Herts Advertiser, and
 Andrea Perkins who had been injured in
 the coach crash at Ledignan. She had  
 been operated upon in France and had  
 started to improve rapidly.
