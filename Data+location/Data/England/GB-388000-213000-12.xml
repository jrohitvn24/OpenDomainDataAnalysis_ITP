		<title>12POLICE - BROCKWORTH AREA</title>
		<content>There is a neighbourhood watch scheme  
here to aid {resident-police relations}
and reduce crime.A local bobby came to 
school to talk about his work.         
{Young attitudes} to police vary-"Most 
youths think the police are only for   
telling you to get off the pavement or 
where are your lights? But they help   
too,eg if you are lost.He asked the    
class if we trusted the police but not 
many put their hands up.But if your    
bike gets stolen or your house burgled 
then things would change"."The police  
have a difficult job-there is less     
respect for them.I think they handle   
people very well compared with foreign 
police by not using excessive violence"
"Now at the age of 13,the thing that   
puts me off the police is the miners   
strike".
