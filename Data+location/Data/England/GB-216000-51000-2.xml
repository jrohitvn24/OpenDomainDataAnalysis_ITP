		<title>02Farming in Lansallos</title>
		<content>      The farming is mostly by small   
 tenant farmers though there area a few
 larger units formed by combining      
 several smaller units by amalgamation 
 or purchase. It is mostly sheep and   
 cattle rearing,with some cereal crops 
 and potatoes,greens and caulflowers.  
 The smaller farms are not really      
 economically viable and it is only a  
 matter of time before they are        
 absorbed by the larger ones.The farms 
 nearly all supplement the income by   
 letting caravans or doing Bed &amp;       
 Breakfast for tourists. They also let 
 off the redundant buildings, usually  
 to tourists.
