		<content> A village school day by Andrea aged 9.
 I normally get up at 7.30am and eat   
 my Weetabix breakfast cereal. Mummy   
 takes me from Martin Mill to school by
 car and in the village I buy a dougnut
 and sweets before walking to school.  
 At school we have assembly including a
 song and a story. The juniors first   
 do writing practice followed by       
 project work on sugar. Later I go out 
 to play chase with my friends and at  
 10.45am I come back in to work on my  
 project after seeing a film like      
 "Sugar from Queensland". At noon I    
 have my lunch of Marmite roll,savoury 
 biscuits and an orange. Other children
 have hot school meals for 50p. In the 
 afternoon we have craft and nature.   
 After school finishes at 3.00pm I go  
 swimming with my parents. Mummy gets  
 tea ready at 6.30 pm. When Daddy goes 
 to the ferries at 8.15pm I go to bed. </content>
