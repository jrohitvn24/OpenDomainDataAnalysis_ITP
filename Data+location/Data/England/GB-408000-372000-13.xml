		<title>13TUNSTEAD FARM</title>
		<content>      Tunstead Farm covers an area of  
 490 acres. The farm house was built in
 the 18th century, whereas most of the 
 out-buildings are quite modern. The   
 farmhouse is owned by Mr.Fotherby, the
 farmer, but{most of the land is owned 
{by I.C.I., who moved the farm in 1979 
{from Great Rocks Farm, as they were   
{extending the quarry workings onto the
{land where the farm house stood.}     
      The land is used for grazing for 
 the 390 cows and 380 sheep, but in the
 summer time some grass is harvested   
 for hay and sileage to feed the       
 animals during a 7-month winter. The  
 cows are divided into 3 groups:       
 calves, milking and dry. The sheep are
 used for their wool and meat.         
       Mr.Fotherby has been farming all
 of his life, and he has thoroughly    
 enjoyed it.
