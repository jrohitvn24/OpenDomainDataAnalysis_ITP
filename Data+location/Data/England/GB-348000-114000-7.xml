 of the guides called Amy Holman and   
 Emma Withers. We call our leaders by  
 nicknames in GUIDES. They are Jay,    
 Chuck and Woodstock.Both of us enjoy  
 GUIDES.It is held on Mondays. We make 
 gadgets and play games. We work for   
 our badges at home a lot. We already  
 have map-readers, country dancing,    
 entertainer and patrol purpose badges.
                                       
 Mr. Redward runs the Youth Club with  
 some help. You have to be ten to get  
 in. It costs 10p for members and 15p  
 for visitors. They have a lot of games
 like snooker, table-tennis, badminton 
 and swingball. It is held at the      
 village hall. About twenty five people
 come each week, on Tuesdays from 7.30 
 - 10.00 pm. They go on a few trips    
 including barbeques and ice-skating in
 Bristol.                              </content>
