   Most old people watch a lot of      
 television.In the summer they seem to 
 spend a lot of time gardening,but in  
 the winter they do not go out so much,
 especially when it is icy.Many of them
 do not have cars but they can get a   
 pass and travel for half fare on the  
 bus.A lot of them have a dog or cat.  
   A lot of ladies belong to the       
 Womens' Institute. There is a meeting 
 on the last Tuesday of each month.They
 enjoy watching demonstrations of      
 things like flower arranging, or cake 
 making ,and they have talks           
 by experts on such things as antiques.
 In the summer ther are coach trips to 
 Whitby and other places.
