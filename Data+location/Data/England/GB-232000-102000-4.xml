		<title>04A TYPICAL FARM</title>
		<content> The farm chosen for this topic is     
 Little Knowle Farm which is  situated 
 approximately 1.5 miles South West of 
 Holsworthy.The farm is owned by one   
 Mr.Hayes,who has been farming since   
 leaving school.The size of this       
 typical farm is 145 acres,which       
 includes pasture,arable land,woodland,
 and farm buildings.                   
  The main type of farming conducted at
 Little Knowle Farm and indeed all the 
 other surrounding farms is dairy      
 farming.Mr Hayes has a herd of 80     
 fresian dairy cattle,which on average 
 will produce 700 litres of milk per   
 day.The milk is collected by tanker   
 every morning at 11:00.The heavy clay 
 soils and wet climate favour dairy    
 farming as the drainage is unsuitable 
 and unproffitable for arable farming. 
 The farm house is a traditional Cob   
 building.(mixture of clay &amp; straw).   </content>
