		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOEL</title>
		<content>   Monday. I wake up at7.30 and get    
 washed.I put on my uniform and check  
 my school bag.Then I feed the cat and 
 talk to my mum. At 8 o'clock I walk to
 school (40 mins!). In my tutorial I do
 my homework or mess about. After      
 registration we go to assembly and    
 then onto a double period of CDT      
 (craft ,design and technology) which I
 enjoy. A single  period is 45 mins.   
 Then we have a 20 minute break and we 
 play football,fight or mess about.    
 Next is double games ; football,rugby,
 cricket,athletics or softball. After  
 lunch (1 hour) we have language and   
 communication followed by maths (yuk).
 At 3.25 we are registered and leave   
 school at 3.40. At home I get changed 
 and I might play football followed by 
 dinner.Then it is homework (3 subjects
 a night). I watch T.V and go to bed at
 9.30.  {BY JOEL MARTIN AGED 13. }     </content>
