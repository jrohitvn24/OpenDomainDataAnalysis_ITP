		<title>11THE MILL AT MICHAELCHURCH.</title>
		<content>   The Mill was built about 250 years  
 ago to serve the village.{It was water
{driven}using a mill race from the     
{Escley Brook.}The present owner is    
 rebuilding it.Ever since he has been  
 born the mill has not worked.So far it
 has taken him 15 months and he hopes  
 to have it finished by{June 1986.}    
     There are three floors in the     
 original building.The bottom floor    
 will be a store room.The second floor 
 had been cemented over by the previous
 owner.Whilst removing this old cement 
 they found some of the original       
{grinding wheels.}It is hoped to get   
 the water wheel turning again.The old 
 shed at the side is being converted   
 into a granny flat.                   
       In the past when the mill was   
 working the flour was taken across to 
 Mill House where the bread was baked.
