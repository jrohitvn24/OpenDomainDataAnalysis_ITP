		<content>{Farming in Lathom}                    
The crops around Lathom are mainly     
barley and vegetables. There are not   
many Dairy Farms in Lathom. In our     
block there are several arable farms.We
chose a particular farm in Lathom to do
our research on. The name of the farm  
is Lower Park Farm. It's area is 130   
acres. Its started off with 17 acres.In
1929 the farm (which was then a        
blacksmith's shop) was sold to the     
present farmer. Across from the        
farmhouse was a tree,it was called the 
battle tree because boys used to go    
there after school and fight. There is 
a saying if it was cut down the village
would lose it's importance. In 1922 it 
was chopped down. Lathom estate was    
sold and the village lost its          
importance. The farmer's father told us
this story. He still works on the farm 
with his son and grandsons.            </content>
