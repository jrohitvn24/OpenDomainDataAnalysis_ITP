		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO BERE FERRERS</title>
		<content>   The leader of this{Domesday Project 
 group had her introduction to{Bere    
{Ferrers}peninsula,when a lane she had 
 been travelling along to get there,   
 turned into a rocky, pit-holed track  
 with no space to turn and with        
 marshland on one side and scrubland on
 the other.The signpost gave no        
 indication that this would happen.    
 There are better means of vehicular   
 access, but this peninsula,almost     
 entirely surrounded by water is best  
 approached by train. Carried high over
 viaducts, rocking along by the Tamar  
 and speeding through fertile pastures 
 one gains a truer impression.         
   "Bere"is Celtic for peninsula or    
 spit of land and Ferrers is named     
 after the Ferrers family. Sir Henry de
 Ferrers was Chairman of the original  
 Domesday Commission! Bere Ferrers is  
 mentioned in Domesday as "Birlanda" . </content>
