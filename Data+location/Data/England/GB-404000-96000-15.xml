		<title>15   HAMPRESTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was originally housed in a 
 thatched cottage about 2 miles from   
 it's present site.The local vicar     
 requested a day school as well as the 
 existing Sunday School.In 1874 the    
 school moved to Hampreston.Housed in  
 what was once the caretaker's house,  
 there is a kitchen area and 2 bedrooms
 used for storage.                     
    The school has 74 pupils and 3 full
 time teachers.The children's education
 begins at four and a half and at the  
 age of nine they leave the school.As a
 church school either the vicar or the 
 curate visits the school weekly.      
    The Parents Association have given 
 the school a video,climbing frame and 
 music centre.Parents may attend the   
 first lesson each day with their      
 children.Mothers help teach cookery   
 and sewing.
