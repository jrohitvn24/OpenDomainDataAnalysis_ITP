<title>21Former Sandoz chemicals factory at Horsforth</title>
<content>The Sandoz factory at Horsforth later became the Clariant factory, when the business was separated from Sandoz in 1995. The factory at Horsforth was gradually closed down in 2008/2009 and has largely been demolished since then. The site was sold to Harrow Estates in 2009, who plan to build around 400-500 houses there. This is a cause of controversy in the area, because the main traffic arteries into Leeds are already overcrowded and this development, along with several other large developments along the Aire Valley, are likely to increase the traffic congestion.&#xd;
3 pictures of the factory, taken in 2005 &amp; 2007, can be seen on the Geograph website ref:315410, 642395 and 43957
