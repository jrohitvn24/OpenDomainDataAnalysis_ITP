		<title>08Agriculture in District</title>
		<content> There are approx. 2500 acres of farm  
 land in Horncliffe area, the land is  
 mostly fertile good quality sandstone 
 loam of Min. of Agriculture grade 2   
 and 3 category. Rising from the River 
 Tweed to about 250 feet above sea     
 level the gently undulating land faces
 slightly North. Most of the farms are 
 owner occupied,and most of the work   
 force are family members. In total no 
 more than 10 hired men are employed,  
 but some farm jobs are carried out by 
 local agricultural contractors.       
   With the reduction in the farm      
 labour force many farm cottages are no
 longer required for staff,so some have
 been sold,and some are now let as     
 furnished self_catering holiday homes.
  most farms are self sufficient,with a
 complete range of modern machinery,but
 a small amount of sharing for mutual  
 benefit takes place.                  </content>
