		<content> There are no buses, shops, public     
 houses, doctor or dentist, post office
 or school.The private Chapel went when
 the hall was demolished and the       
 nearest church is at Stoke Rochford,  
 in which parish Easton lies.The       
 original school is now a private      
 dwelling. No one seems to know where  
 the stone cross came from or what it  
 commorates.It is perhaps a small      
 replica of original Eleanor cross but 
 the story goes that when or if, the   
 cross isv demolished  the answer will 
 be found underneath it.The public road
 from the Ermine Street to the East,   
 ends at the cross and the following   
 road to the A.1. is orivate to the    
 Estate. Following the line of Ermine  
 Street on the eastern side, is        
 derelict railway line which used to   
 carry ironore from the quarries at    
 Colsterworth and Woolsthorpe to join  </content>
