		<content> My shool has a big playground at the  
 front and a large playing field at the
 back.  It is built around an enclosed 
 rectangular garden.                   
 Along the front corridor is the head- 
 mistress's room and the secretary's   
 office.  There are cloakrooms at each 
 end and a changing room for P.E. and  
 Drama, which we do in the assembly    
 hall opposite the front entrance.     
 On the right hand corridor is the     
 library and the staffroom and down the
 left hand corridor are the needlework 
 and the cookery rooms.  On the back   
 corridor all the rooms are classrooms.
 There are stairs at the front leading 
 to the top front corridor.  My        
 classroom is here and this is where   
 the computers are kept.  Next door is 
 the art room, then a science          
 laboratory and finally the french     
 room.                                 </content>
