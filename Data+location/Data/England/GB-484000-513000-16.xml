{FIRING THE "STIDDY"}                  
 Firing the "stiddy" or anvil is a     
 centuries old custom which signals a  
 notable event in the history of the   
 Normanby Family.                      
 The anvil is placed upside down on the
 common outside the blacksmith's shop. 
 The hole is filled with gunpowder and 
 sealed with a wooden plug which has a 
 hole through its centre.The plug is   
 tapped into place and the centre hole 
 is filled with gunpowder leaving a    
 little on the surface.This is then    
 fired by touching it with a long iron 
 rod, the end of which has been heated 
 red hot in the blacksmith's forge.A   
 loud explosion follows.The stiddy     
 was last fired by MR.Len Jackson in   
 honour of the Queen Mother who        
 stayed in Lythe on 15th. July 1976.   </content>
