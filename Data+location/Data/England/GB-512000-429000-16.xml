		<title>16H.M.S GALATEA AT HULL</title>
		<content> H.M.S. GALATEA is a Royal Naval       
 frigate.It is a reasonably small      
 vessel used for anti-submarine        
 detection.It is equipped with modern  
 computers, weapons and a Wasp         
 helicopter for this purpose.          
 The main threat to our nation comes   
 from the Russians who have submarines 
 equipped with missiles armed with     
 nuclear warheads, as do we.           
 Much of the ship's time is spent      
 promoting goodwill around the world   
 and in this cause visits Hull quite   
 often.                                
 On their last visit to Hull they      
 brought the Wasp to Mountbatten School
 to show the children and they let Mr.P
 Simmons fly back to the ship in it to 
 take slides for the Domesday Project. 
 During its time in port the ship is   
 open for visiting and the crew took   
 part in parades in the city centre.   </content>
