		<title>14RELIGION IRONBRIDGE</title>
		<content>  {Holy Trinity, Coalbrookdale}was     
 built in 1854 by Abraham Darby 4 who  
 changed from Quakerism to the Church  
 of England. The bells at Holy Trinity 
 were made in 1920 by Whitechapel bell 
 foundry. In 1835{St.Lukes Church}was  
 built on a slope in Ironbridge and it 
 was built back to front because the   
 slope could not take the full strain  
 of the tower.                         
   Mr Zwalf has been vicar for 7 years.
 There have been 8 vicars before him   
 at Coalbrookdale and 7 at Ironbridge. 
 He does 2_3 jobs a day and works 6    
 days a week, which includes hospital  
 visiting, and visiting a group of     
 elderly people in the Community Centre
 at Sunniside. Mr Zwalf's favourite    
 hymn is "WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS   
 CROSS".
