		<title>11HOUSING IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON}has very few houses. None of   
 them is less than twenty years old.   
 Most of them were built by the Turnor 
 family for either farm managers,      
 farm-workers or their own family such 
 as the dower house now called Warren  
 House. Most houses are owner-occupied.
 There are six empty houses in{PANTON  
 these are three pairs of farm cottages
 They are in a habitable condition but 
 it is unlikely that they will be lived
 in as they still belong respectively  
 to Warren House Farm and{PANTON}House 
 farm who will not require them for    
 farmworkers and it is unlikely that if
 they came up for sale that anyone     
 would be interested in buying them    
 because of employment problems in the 
 area. Ironically there is a nationwide
 housing problem. One pair of farm     
 cottages -next to Skew Bridge has been
 converted to one single house.        </content>
