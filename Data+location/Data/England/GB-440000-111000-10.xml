     The children at Bevois Town School
 have parents who come from Jamaica,   
 India, Pakistan and England.          
     Many of the children go to the    
 temple every Sunday. The girls like to
 dress up in suits. When they are older
 they will wear saris. The boys wear   
 ordinary clothes.                     
     The temple is in Peterborough     
 Road. Before we enter the temple we   
 have to cover our heads with scarves  
 called  chunia.  The boys have        
 hankerchiefs which they can take off  
 when they go downstairs.              
     The children like the temple.     
 After we take our shoes off we go     
 upstairs to pray and sing. Afterwards 
 we have apples and oranges and sweets.
 We like to eat and play best.
