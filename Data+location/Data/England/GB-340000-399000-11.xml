		<title>11Dialects and accent</title>
		<content> The people of Kirkby speak with the   
 same accent as the people in          
 Liverpool.                            
  This is because the town was an      
 overspill area built to help the      
 Liverpool slum clearance programme .  
 Although the accent is the same as    
 Liverpool  the children of Kirkby are 
 developing their own slang words . An 
 example of this is the use of the word
 "bizzies"for the police .             
 Unlike other towns where the accent   
 becomes steadily diluted the further  
 moves from the town ,the Kirkby accent
 and dialect ends on the boundaries .  
 Nearby villages , such as Rainford    
 and Bickerstaffe , have their own     
 Lancashire accent and dialect.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
