		<content> Gittisham village is just three miles 
 from Honiton where there is still a   
 railway station serving trains between
 Exeter and London (Waterloo), and many
 other facilities, but the transport to
 Honiton itself is difficult if you    
 haven't got a car. There is a shopping
 bus which goes to Honiton on a Tuesday
 morning for Market day but for any    
 daily bus services people have to walk
 down to the main road.                
 In the village we have a Post Office, 
 a bakery and general store, and a     
 motor mechanic will travel in to      
 service cars. A fish van calls on a   
 Wednesday and a butcher on Friday;    
 a newsagent ensures daily papers. A   
 milkman calls three times a week and a
 local farmer can supply milk in       
 between times. Logs for the fires and 
 christmas trees are readily available.
 All in all our everyday needs are met.</content>
