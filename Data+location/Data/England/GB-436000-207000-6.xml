		<title>06The Village of South Leigh</title>
		<content> outh Leigh is a small rural village,  
 wo miles from Witney. It has an old   
 hurch and a "listed" half-timbered    
 arm house in the oldest part of the   
village. There is also an old school   
but now children are taken by bus to   
school at Cogges or Ducklington and the
building is used for the Youth club.   
There are a few more houses around     
the church and more on the main road   
(about two dozen altogeter). Most      
houses are quite old although many     
have been enlarged and modernised.     
There is a large,well known restaurant 
and pub and also a village shop/post-  
office. Many people are related in the 
village and quite a lot work on farms. 
Sometimes the narrow lane to Witney    
gets blocked by snow in winter.        
 There used to be industry such as     
wagon building and wheelwrights but now
there is only agriculture.             </content>
