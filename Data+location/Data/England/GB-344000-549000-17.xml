		<title>17VINTAGE CARS,COTEHILL</title>
		<content> My dad likes old cars. He does them   
 up.He has a 1935 Austin seven and a   
 Morris. He is making  a new back for  
 the Austin because it doesnt look     
 right. He made the Austin seven.He    
 keeps it in his barn. He has spent the
 last 12 years working on this car. We 
 went to a show near Golden Fleece and 
 first they had tractors on show and   
 then old cars and motor bikes and     
 steam engines. Then  we went round a  
 ring to see which was the best one.   
 The best got a plaque and a medal.
