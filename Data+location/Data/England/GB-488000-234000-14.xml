		<content>  There is a mixture of housing in the 
 village from the old to the very      
 new.There are three listed buildings  
 in the village;All Saints             
 Church,Poplar Farm House and the      
 Wheatsheaf Public House.We noticed the
 outside of the Wheatsheaf was being   
 painted.The newest houses are on a    
 small development and are two years   
 and four months old.We found examples 
 of terraced houses,semi_detached and  
 detached houses and bungalows.These   
 are mainly privately owned though     
 there is some council property.One    
 house for sale in the village was     
 advertised in the local paper for     
 Â£71500.There is no gas in the village 
 so they have to use electricity for   
 heating,cooking and lighting which    
 comes into the houses from overhead   
 wires.however some people use oil to  
 heat their homes.                     </content>
