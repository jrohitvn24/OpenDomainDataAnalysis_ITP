		<title>04THE TOWN HALL</title>
		<content>   The Town Hall was opened in 1962 and
 replaced the old Guild Hall.The Town  
 Hall is much larger and grander than  
 the old Guild Hall and has a large    
 hall with a stage.This hall is in     
 constant use especially by the local  
 drama groups who perform their plays  
 there.                                
                                       
   The Town Hall has a very grand      
 entrance which is only used on very   
 special occasions.This entrance has   
 been used in many of "The Carry On    
 Doctor" films of the late 1960s and   
 early 1970s.                          
                                       
   In 1974 Windsor and Maidenhead      
 Borough Councils were joined together 
 and the Town Hall was used as the     
 centre of local administration.
