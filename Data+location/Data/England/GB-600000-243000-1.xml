		<title>01KERSEY-HADLEIGH</title>
		<content> In our study area the dominant land   
cover is agricultural crops, mainly    
wheat, barley and oil seed rape.       
 The settlement of this area is mainly 
isolated farmsteads but there is also  
part of the village of Kersey  and part
of the town of Hadleigh. Kersey is now 
a small village that is well known for 
the tudor timber buildings and a ford  
in the main street. Hadleigh is a small
Suffolk market town that has become a  
dormatory town for Ipswich.The tip of  
Hadleigh in the study area is mainly   
the new industrial estate, housing many
light industries.                      
 This area was once heavily populated  
and the local economy was based on     
wool. After many centuries of decline  
the area is once again growing, this   
time it is the proximity to Europe that
has provided the energy to grow.
