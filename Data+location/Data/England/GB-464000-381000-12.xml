		<title>12'CAMP' TO PRISON, RANBY</title>
		<content>   When the Army no longer required the
 site after 1969, there was anxiety in 
 the area over the loss of job         
 opportunities, and the local M.P., Mr.
 Joe Ashton made representations at    
 Westminster to ensure a continued use.
   In 1970, it was announced that the  
 site would be used for a new prison.  
 This was heard with mixed feelings,   
 but public opinion was reassured when 
 it was made clear that the prisoners  
 were of Category 'C', i.e.            
 non-violent, and mainly serving short 
 sentences.
