		<title>08WATER CYCLE IN LOUGHBOROUGH</title>
		<content> Our water comes from the Derbyshire   
 Peaks. When it rains on to hills it   
 forms streams that flow into the River
 Dove. The water is collected in a big 
 pipe and it is pumped by Severn Trent 
 Water Authority to a distribution     
 point at the water treatment works to 
 be cleaned. It is then piped to Lough_
 borough,Quorn and Leicester.          
                                       
 It now reaches our houses.            
                                       
 Once it is used it is sent to the     
 sewage works to be cleaned again by   
 pipes. The treated water is pumped    
 back into Wood Brook,which runs along 
 to the River Soar,then the River      
 Trent,then the River Humber and       
 finally back to the North Sea.
