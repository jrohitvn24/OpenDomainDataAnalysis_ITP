		<content> The area holds in somewhat strange    
 tension the fact that while it needs  
 Tourism and its financial benefits,   
 the weight of many thousand visitors, 
 and especially their cars, bears      
 heavily upon local facilities -       
 including a road system virtually     
 unchanged from days of horse traffic. 
 Moreover, to find it almost impossible
 to shop in normally relaxed style is  
 trying to elderly residents.  However,
 it can truly be said that many        
 visitors have been coming for so many 
 years that 'locals' see them genuinely
 as friends.  A tension indeed - but   
 one with which the area has lived, and
 must continue to live.
