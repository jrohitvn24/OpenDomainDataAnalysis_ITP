		<content>   WHERE FARMERS ALONG THE COASTAL     
STRIP HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOCATE PART OF 
THEIR LANDS TO CATERING TO HOLIDAY     
FOLK,BEHIND THIS STRIP TRADITIONAL     
FARMIG HAS CONTINUES .                 
   THE FARMLAND IS ON A BELT OF MARINE 
CLAY WHICH IS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE 
PEAT MOORS WHICH ARE TO THE EAST ON THE
SOMERSET LEVELS. THIS CLAY BELT IS     
DRAINED INTO THE RIVER AXE. IN RECENT  
 EARS IMPROVED DRAINAGE DITCHES,OR     
RHINES,HAVE RESULTED IN A LOWERING OF  
THE WATER TABLE AND AS A RESULT ARABLE 
USE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY POSSIBLE. 
   IN THE PLACE OF TRADITIONAL PASTURE 
WITH THE ATTENDENT BLACK AND WHITE     
FRIESIANS,THE OCCASIONAL FIELD OF      
CEREALS NOW APPEARS.AT PRESENT 1 FARMER
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH A SMALL          
PLANTATION OF APPLE TREES.
