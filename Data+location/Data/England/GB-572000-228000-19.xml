		<content>      The{Shalford W.I.}was formed in  
 1920 and so has celebrated its{Diamond
{Jubilee. }When it began there was no  
 village hall and meetings were held in
 the school on Saturday afternoons.    
      Village living conditions and way
 of life have changed completely and,  
 with these changes, the subjects of   
 the groups monthly talks. Such skills 
 as shoe repairing and rabbit skinning 
 are no longer greatly needed but the  
 format for the meetings remains the   
 same - business, educational and      
 social.                               
      In 1985 members have heard about 
 wholefood cookery (fast gaining in    
 popularity), experiences of a police  
 woman, coaching holidays at home and  
 abroad and how to relieve stress.     
      The exhibit at the{County Show   
 demonstrates the high standard and    
 many skills of ordinary members.      </content>
