		<title>06      A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>   The day begins at 7:30 a.m. when he 
 arrives for work. The machines,       
 tractors etc. are then started for the
 day. Work continues until 10:00 when  
 he stops for his "docky" break, with  
 tea or coffee from a flask and a light
 snack until 10:30.                    
   Work continues until 1:00 on a range
 of jobs depending on the time of year.
 These include crop spraying,          
 ploughing, sugar beet lifting,        
 maintenance work, planting, combining,
 straw baling, straw burning, muck     
 carting and spreading.                
   From 1:00 to 1:30 is dinner break.  
 Afternoon work commences at 1:30 and  
 continues until 4:30 when the farmer  
 finishes for the day and returns home 
 for his main meal.In some seasons and 
 at corn cutting time more hours       
 are worked but with the aid of the    
 modern machinery the day is shorter.  </content>
