		<content> Okeford Fitzpaine is a pretty village 
 surrounded by green hills.  It lies in
 the middle of the {Blackmore Vale}.   
 There are many signs of early human   
 settlement in the area ,including     
{tumuli}and{field systems}.            
                                       
 The village is made up of some very   
 picturesque old cottages, many still  
 thatched and dating back to the 18th  
 century and beyond.  There is a small 
 village school,a church,a Methodist   
 chapel, a village hall, a shop and    
 Post Office and a Public House.       
                                       
 Because of the charming nature of the 
 village centre, it was designated a   
{"conservation area"}in 1974, and this 
 has successfully retained the         
 essential character of the village.
