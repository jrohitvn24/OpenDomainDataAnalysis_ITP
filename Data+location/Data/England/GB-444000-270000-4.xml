		<content>Along the A45/M45 junction, Thurlaston 
there is a line of Scots Pines.The     
original three miles were planted by   
the Duke of Montagu, 1740.He also      
planted four pine trees near the Wroth 
Silver mound(supposedly the grave of   
Colbrand the Danish giant slain by Guy 
of Warwick AD920).On the mound lies a  
stone with a square hole, once the base
of a cross.                            
At dawn on November 11th, the Lord of  
the Manor and those paying dues would  
gather around.The steward would ask the
parishes in turn to place their money  
in the stone walking around it three   
times.Failure to pay meant loss of     
money or a white bull with red nose and
ears.The custom still continues today. 
P.S. In medieval times when a new house
was built,a dead cat was placed in the 
thatched roof to frighten away evil    
spirits and witches.                   </content>
