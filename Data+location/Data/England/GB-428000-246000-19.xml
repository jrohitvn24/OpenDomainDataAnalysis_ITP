		<content> Fulready has the only intensive       
 farming unit in our area.This is a    
 poultry unit for battery hens.This    
 makes it possible for the farmer to   
 house 1,000 hens in a comparitvely    
 small space.The birds are kept in     
 continued artificial light with access
 to food and water. Thus they are      
 highly productive and economically    
 viable.All the farms in our area      
 predominately mixed arable but none of
 the farmers specialise completly.     
 They have either some sheep or beef   
 cattle or both.The arable crops are   
 mainly cereal wheat or barley but oil 
 seed rape is becoming popular because 
 of the increased demand for  uegetable
 oil.Grass crops are for the cattle and
 sheep but some is specifically grown  
 for high quality hay. Nearby is the   
 centre of the Warwickshire Hunt and   
 the demand for good hay is constant.  </content>
