		<content>  {Redbourn Common}is a very large open
  space in the middle of the village.It
 links the High Street with the old    
 village centre at{Church End}in the   
 West of the village.                  
   It is a very important part of the  
 village life because it is in constant
 use for all sorts of things.          
   At the beginning of this century the
{Common}was used for the grazing of{   
{Sheep}and{Goats},people hung their    
 washing there to dry and there was    
 even a{Golf Course}on the Common.     
   Now in 1985 the Common is used every
 week for{Cricket Matches}.Also there  
 is a{Play Ground}for the children.In  
 the summer people come down to the    
 Common with a picnic.                 
   The{Scouts}and{Round Tablers,}      
 organize fetes and carnivals          
 especially in the summer.Also a{Fun   
{Fair}comes at least twice a year.     </content>
