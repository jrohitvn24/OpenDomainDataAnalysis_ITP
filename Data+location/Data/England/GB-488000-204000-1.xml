		<content> The area is in Buckinghamshire, mainly
 on the Chiltern escarpment, 600-700   
 feet above sea-level. It is virtually 
 the parish of The Lee, population     
 approx 500 adults. The main           
 residential area is Lee Common, as    
 building has been contained since     
 1850. With the advent of personal     
 transport together with the railway   
 line to London nearby, The Lee is now 
 largely a commuter area for London.   
 The Block is entirely within the      
 Chiltern A.O.N.B., &amp; is crossed by the
 Ivinghoe-Avebury Ridgeway Path. It is 
 a rural area, with considerable       
 farmland &amp; about 30% woodland. A large
 portion of the land is still owned &amp;  
 farmed by the Stewart-Liberty family, 
 who bought the manor in the late 19th 
 century, though several farms &amp; most  
 of the houses have since been sold.
