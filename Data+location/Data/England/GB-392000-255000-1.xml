		<title>01Crowle &amp; Land to the East</title>
		<content>  The area is mainly flat and          
 agricultural and has the expanding    
 village of Crowle on its western side.
 There are two small hamlets, Sale     
 Green and Huddington in the N of the  
 area which is split NS by the main    
 watercoutse of Bow Brook.   Two large 
 houses, Huddington Court Frospere     
 Court lie close to Bow Brook as does  
 Bow Wood.   Several minor roads cross 
 the area but in the south east corner 
 the Worcester to Stratford road passes
 through.   The work force is split    
 between those commuting to work in the
 large urban areas such as Worcester,  
 Droitwich and Birmingham, and those   
 working in the local farming industry.
