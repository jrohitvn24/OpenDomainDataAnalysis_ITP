		<content> There are no doctors surgeries in the 
 area so most families go to a doctor  
 in Tenbury or to the Leominster Health
 Centre.                               
        At the school we have regular  
 visits from the school doctor,dentist,
 phisiotherapist,nurse,audiometrician, 
 and optician and specialists such as  
 the pediatrician or the speech        
 therapist may be referred to.The      
 school nurse visits occasionally to   
 check for head lice which in common   
 with other schools we suffer from now 
 and again.                            
    The nearest hospital is Leominster 
 Cottage Hospital but for all Xrays and
 anything but the most minor injuries  
 one must travel to Hereford
