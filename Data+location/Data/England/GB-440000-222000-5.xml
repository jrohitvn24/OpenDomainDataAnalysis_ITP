		<content> Andrew Philip Woods (3), whose father 
 is the stockman on the Barton Abbey   
 Estate, and who lives at Leys Farm,   
 goes to Middle Barton play group on   
 Monday and Wednesday mornings and     
 Friday afternoon. When he comes home  
 at lunchtime he might bring a friend  
 with him, or go to his friend's house 
 until his sister is collected at      
 3.00 pm. He has lunch with his father 
 when he is at home. He plays with his 
 friend or his mother on the swing or  
 slide or climbing frame in the garden.
 He also like jigsaw puzzles very much.
 He helps to feed the chickens and     
 bantams and geese which his mother    
 keeps.
