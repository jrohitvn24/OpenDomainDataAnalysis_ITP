 There was in 1651 a Mission Church    
 at Newhouse. George and Edward Smythe 
 gave money and provided the priests   
 with lodging and food for 1 horse and 
 2 cows and Â£10 a year. Father Milburn 
 is our present priest and he was      
 ordained in 1953. There were many     
 predecessors such as - Rev. John      
 Barlow who left Northumberland to come
 to Newhouse in 1731 and then went to  
 Stella in Blaydon once a month to     
 supply there. In 1736 he went back to 
 Lanchashire. Rev. Robert Carnaby in   
 1729 was visited by Bishop Williams   
 and he confirmed 31 people. He left   
 Newhouse but returned in 1736 and died
 in 1745. His home was set on fire by a
 cat removing some linen from a clothes
 -horse. Father R. Gibbons was ar      
 Newhouse from 1937 to his death in    
 1978.                                 </content>
