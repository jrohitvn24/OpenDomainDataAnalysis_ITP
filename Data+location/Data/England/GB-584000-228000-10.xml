		<title>10THE PRIORY,EARLS COLNE</title>
		<content> Many references have been made to the{
{Priory}as both a monastry and a manor 
 house. The house which aquired the    
 same name was built alongside the     
 monastry soon after the dissolution of
 1536. The Tudor manor house, faced    
 west  with a walled courtyard at the  
 front; farm buildings and two lakes   
 to the south; and an enclosed orchard,
 complete with dove house, to the      
 north. The perimeter wall, with its   
 three gateways, seems to have extended
 the full length of the couseway, to   
 the point where it makes a left turn  
 towards the church.                   
   When the house was rebuilt,in 1750, 
 all but a tiny fragment was destroyed.
   The building is no longer used as a{
{Priory}, but as an attractive private 
 house where Mr. and Mrs Jordon live.
