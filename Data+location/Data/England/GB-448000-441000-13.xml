		<title>13THE VIADUCT</title>
		<content>   The railway viaduct upstream was    
 built by George Hudson  in 1849 as    
 part of his Leeds to York direct      
 line.This railway was never completed 
 due to the fall of the railway king   
 and the viaducts only traffic was to  
 and from Ingleby mills from Tadcaster 
 station.The mill tower dates from the 
 1870's .The viaduct is now owned by   
 the town,it was purchased by the  Town
 Council from British Rail in 1980 for 
 the nominal sum of a hundred pounds.  
 Work has been done to repair the      
 parapet wall and to cut steps down to 
 both banks of the river.It now        
 provides a pleasant footpath link     
 across the river. During the summer   
 children who bathe in the river jump  
 from the viaduct into the water       
 below.
