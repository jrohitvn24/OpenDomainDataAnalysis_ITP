		<title>06National Dawn Chorus Day.</title>
		<content> Sunday, May 5th, 4.30a.m.was dark,wet,
 cold and windy but, not dismayed, we  
 made our way up {Longstone Hill}over{ 
{Ladys Edge }down into {Hodders Combe.}
 Nothing stirred apart from resting    
 sheep and feeding rabbits.            
    Soon from the trees lining the     
 stream could be heard {blackbirds} and
{robins, }the {pheasants }call and the 
 everlasting {cuckoo. }The chorus was  
 soon joined by the {wren, } various{  
{warblers }and {tits }and the          
 persistent {wood pigeon.}Conspicuous  
 by his silence  after yesterdays      
 performance was the {green woodpecker.
 Many summer visitors are late arriving
 perhaps due to the cold spring.       
     The light shining through the     
 young birch and beech leaves made them
 appear translucent.A group of Red     
 Deer moved silently away. The rain had
 stopped and it was a good day.        </content>
