		<title>04S.BADDESLEY/NORLEY WOOD</title>
		<content> This scattered,rural parish now linked
 with Boldre includes the hamlets of   
 Norley Wood,South Baddesley and       
 Portmore.For many years there has been
 no shop or Post Office in the area and
 now the one bus service calls only at 
 Norley Wood about once in 2 hours.A   
 major proportion fo the area is in the
 ownership of 2 large estates,Newtown  
 and Pylewell Parks.Residents are      
 largely private property owners or    
 agricultural tenants,there being no   
 other industries (The Pylewell tenants
 can live in their estate cottages for 
 as long as they need)  The church of  
 St.Mary,S.Baddesley was built around  
 185O by the then owner of Pylewell    
 Park and the private entrance provided
 for them is still in use.The annual   
 Christmas Fayre and the Summer Fete   
 form the main fund-raising activites.
