		<content> We discovered nearly all Companies    
 stored goods on the site in large     
 warehouses as a staging post for      
 nationwide distribution.Only 4        
 Companies exported.Diversity of       
 companies range from food and         
 household goods to double             
 glazing,obviously a growth            
 industry.Seven out of eighteen        
 companies were entirely British,all   
 the others having some foreign        
 interst.Only 3 companies offered      
 facilities for sports and social      
 activities.However,it should be       
 pointed out that one company          
 completely outstripped others in      
 size,and scope and numbers employed,by
 many times.This particular company    
 Safeway,offered all social benefits   
 and pension schemes that would be     
 expected of a Multi-National Company.
