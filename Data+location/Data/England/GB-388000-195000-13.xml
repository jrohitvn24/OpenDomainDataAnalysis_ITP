		<title>13PUBLIC HOUSES &amp; RESTAURANTS</title>
		<content> There is very little organised {      
{RECREATION}and{ENTERTAINMENT}in the   
 area. Many people like to spend an    
 evening at a {PUBLIC HOUSE}or "Pub".  
 It is customary for people to play    
 skittles if the "Pub" has a "skittle  
 alley". "The Cross Inn" at the upper  
 end of{Avening}High Street is just    
 such a "Pub". This establishment has  
 an off-licence and is supplied by     
 Whitbread Breweries in Gloucester. The
 only other public house in the block  
 is the "Troublehouse" on the Tetbury  
 to Cirencester road (London Road).    
 There were, however, two other public 
 houses several years ago: "The        
 Butchers Arms" in Point Road is now a 
 house and the "Bell Inn" at the end of
 New Inn Lane is now the "Gibbons      
 Restaurant". The latter specializes in
 high class cuisine and caters for     
 people from as far away as Bristol.   </content>
