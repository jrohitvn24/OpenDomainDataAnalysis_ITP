		<content>  In Newport there is a large grass    
 recreation field.It is used for many  
 sporting events and is really the     
 focal point for sporting activity in  
 the village.In the winter time,the    
 field is marked out for football and  
 the village team plays regularly in an
 adult football league.The school also 
 uses the football pitch to entertain  
 visiting schools for friendly matches.
  In the summer,joggers,golfers and the
 school, use the field constantly.This 
 summer of 1985,has seen the emergence 
 of a newly formed cricket club.Turf   
 has been laid for a good wicket and a 
 large roller,left in the recreation   
 field from previous years, when       
 cricket was  more popular,has been    
 brought back into use to roll the     
 pitch.It is a beautiful field and     
 although many people enjoy sport there
 many more just enjoy walking on it.   </content>
