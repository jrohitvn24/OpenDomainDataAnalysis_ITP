		<title>04A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>I wake most mornings at 7am.I lie in   
bed for ten minutes and then get       
dressed and go down to do my piano     
practise.After that I have breakfast   
which is usually cereal.Next I feed my 
guinea pigs, Rags and Chess and then   
it's time for school.My mum takes me to
school. The day starts with ten        
minutes mental arithmetic and then     
assembly. After assembly we work from  
the timetable or at classwork. We have 
a morning break and an hour for lunch. 
School finishes at 3.15pm.When I get   
home I have a drink and then watch the 
television. Tea is at 5.30 and after   
tea I sometimes play with my freind    
Emma. I practise my violin and then at 
8.30 I go to bed,but it is not always  
easy to go to sleep.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
