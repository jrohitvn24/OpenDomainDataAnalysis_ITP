		<content>   We are lucky in having an open-air, 
 heated swimming pool.  This was built 
 on the site of the former Miner's     
 Welfare.  There is a 25m. main pool, a
 learner pool, a paddling pool, picnic 
 area and a putting green.  Open from  
 April to October, the Pool is popular 
 with local people and visitors.       
   Every year in June the swimming pool
 committee assisted by volunteers help 
 organise a swimming gala.  This       
 year,its tenth anniversary, there were
 211 competitors and 4 pool records    
 were broken.  There were 15 teams     
 entered in the "Its a Knockout"       
 contest which was great fun for the   
 300 spectators to watch.  A video     
 camera was used to record the final   
 events and Â£757 was raised towards    
 pool funds.
