		<title>05      Shopping.</title>
		<content>      There is no proper shop in the   
 village. Sweets and ice creams may be 
 bought at the garage, and odd things  
 are sold at the Post Office. There are
 a number of mobile shops which visit  
 the village and the milkman carries a 
 wide range of food items. A baker     
 comes to the village three times a    
 week with a good selection of bread   
 and cakes. A butcher with the usual   
 meat products comes on Friday, and a  
 fishmonger visits on Wednesday. A fish
 and chip van tours the locality at    
 tea-time on Thursday.                 
      As all items bought in this way  
 tend to be expensive, most people like
 to visit a supermarket once a week.   
 The places visited most are Blandford,
 Poole and Wimborne. For other items   
 such as clothing, furniture and       
 special purchases, Bournemouth and    
 Poole are the favoured places.        </content>
