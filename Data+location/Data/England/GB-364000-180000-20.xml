		<title>20A Small Factory.Frampton.</title>
		<content> A.F. Drew has a small factory in Mill 
 Lane. He employs six men and together 
 they make farm buildings and gates and
 things like that. The business has    
 been based in Frampton Cotterell for  
 thirty years having started off in    
 Court Road near where  Rentokill used 
 to be. Mr. Drew used to be a          
 blacksmith and mended farm and garden 
 tools during the war. The company     
 builds exactly what the farmer wants  
 this means that everything that is    
 made is different. His main customers 
 are local farmers.
