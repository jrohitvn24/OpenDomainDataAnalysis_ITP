		<content>      The religious needs of the area  
 are served by the Anglican Church at  
 Slimbridge and a Chapel at Gossington.
 The history of the Slimbridge Church  
 is dealt with elsewhere, the Chapel at
 Gossington although looking very      
 run-down from the outside is, in fact,
 regularly used by local inhabitants.  
      Members of other religious groups
 have to travel to nearby towns to     
 worship - Dursley, Stroud and         
 Stonehouse.  With the continued       
 development of Slimbridge it is       
 possible that in the not too distant  
 future there will be a need  for      
 further religious building within the 
 area although financial considerations
 might make this difficult.
