		<title>19IS IT BREAK YET, MR PRICE?</title>
		<content> WE LIKE TO PLAY AND TO HAVE SOME FRESH
 AIR AT BREAK TIMES. RICHARD IS THE    
 GREEN SLIME MONSTER WITH JONATHAN;    
 EMILY IS FIRESTAR AND PAUL IS THE     
 HULK. WE CATCH THE BADDIES AND PUT    
 THEM IN THE HOLE MADE BY THE HULK WHO 
 SMASHES HIS HANDS ON THE GROUND. WE   
 PLAY AT THE GOLDEN EAGLE. EMILY CHASES
 JONATHAN WHO IS MONKEY MAGIC, PAUL WHO
 IS HE-MAN AND RICHARD WHO IS          
 SPIDERMAN. HE-MAN SAVES HIS FRIENDS BY
 SMASHING A WALL DOWN AND SAVING THEM. 
 IN A GAME CALLED MANIMAL PAUL TURNS   
 INTO A LEOPARD, EMILY TURNS INTO A    
 LION AND EVERYONE BECOMES AN ANIMAL.  
 WHEN THE BADDIES SET THE HOUSE ON FIRE
 THE LEOPARD JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW   
 AND SAVES THE LADY. WE GET THE IDEAS  
 FOR OUR GAMES FROM THE TELEVISION. IF 
 WE DON'T WISH TO GO OUTSIDE AT BREAK  
 TIMES WE CAN STAY IN SCHOOL OR SPEND  
 THE TIME PARTLY IN AND OUT. SMASHING! </content>
