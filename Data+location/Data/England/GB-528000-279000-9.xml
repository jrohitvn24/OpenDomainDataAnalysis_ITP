		<title>09NEW PLAYGROUND GAMES,WARBOYS</title>
		<content> These are some of the new playground  
 games that we play in our school      
 playground.                           
 In{Space Invaders}we have to line up  
 against a wall. Someone stands in     
 front of the line and throws a ball   
 to try to hit someone else. When      
 someone is hit, he has to throw the   
 ball at the others.                   
 To play{Pacman}you need three or more 
 players. It is a chase game and one   
 person is{Pacman.}Everyone runs around
 on the lines of the netball court and{
{Pacman}chases them. Everyone has three
 lives and if a person sits down{Pacman
 can't get them.                       
 In{British Bulldog}everyone stands at 
 one end of the playground and someone 
 is 'it' at the other. Everybody has to
 get to the other side without being   
 'tigged'. If they are touched by the  
 one who is 'it' they have to help him.</content>
