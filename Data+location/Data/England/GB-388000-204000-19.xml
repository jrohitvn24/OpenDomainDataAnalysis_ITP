		<content> The Cross situated on the roadside    
 just outside Bisley on the way to     
 Stroud originally marked the Parish   
 boundary between the Manors of Bisley 
 and Lypiatt.  It was known as the     
 Lord's Stone and mentioned as early as
 1654. On one side is the figure of a  
 saint with uplifted arms, and on the  
 other the Virgin. Both are beneath    
 arches. A later "PB" as been added to 
 show the limit of the Parish boundary.
 On the roads to both Bourne's Green   
 and Througham there are the remains of
 neolithic barrows.                    
 A thirteenth century cross stands at  
 the west end of Bisley churchyard.  It
 is twelve feet high.  It is nicknamed 
 "The Bone House". Many of the names   
 locally are a record of past times:   
 George Street, Dr Crouch's Road,      
 Bearsfield, Priest Hollow, Cricketty  
 Mill and the Chantry.                 </content>
