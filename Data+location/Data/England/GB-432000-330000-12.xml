		<content> I wake up at 7.50 to 8.00 and get     
 dressed.Then I tell my mum what I want
 for breakfast.I usually have cereal   
 and a cup of tea.I watch "TV AM" till 
 8.20 and then I have my hair done and 
 then go to school.When I get to school
 I do my handwriting until we go for   
 assembly. When assembly finishes we   
 carry on with our work.Playtime       
 comes.We stay in and do some work then
 we work until dinner or do P.E.At noon
 we go home.I stay at home until it is
