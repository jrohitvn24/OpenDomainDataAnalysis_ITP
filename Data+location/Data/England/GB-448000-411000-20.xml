		<title>20The Legend of Robin Hood.</title>
		<content> Barnsdale Forest once covered the     
 area and folklore suggests that Robin 
 Hood spent much of his time here.     
{The Bishop's Tree.                    
  One day the{Bishop of Hereford}was   
 riding through Barnsdale Forest.      
 Suddenly before him stood Robin Hood  
 and his Merry men.Before he robbed him
 of Â£300 Robin made the bishop dance   
 and jig around the tree.The site of   
 the tree is in Skelbrooke Park.       
{Robin Hood's Well.                    
{ }One fine day a young man dressed in 
 green clothes stopped at the well     
 between{Barnsdale Bar and Redhouse }  
{Roundabout,}to drink.The well was very
 popular and even more so when a{huge  
{armchair}was carved out of limestone. 
 He said he had travelled far and was  
 on his way to Barnsdale.The young man 
 was none other than{Robin Hood. }
