		<content>{Clare Arundel writes:-                
 One Wednesday I woke up and got out of
 bed.My clothes were at the bottom of  
 the bed.I took them to the bathroom   
 and got washed.I could not go down    
 because the burglar alarm was still on
 so I read a book until my Mam got up  
 to switch it off.She made breakfast,  
 brushed my hair,then gave me a packet 
 of chicken crisps.I got my coat and   
 school bag and went to call on my     
 friend.When we got to school we had a 
 big assembly(the whole school) and    
 went to Maths.After that we had break,
 we played with my skipping rope.We had
 English,we did poems,and then went    
 home for dinner.I had soup and toast  
 then played out until it was time to  
 go back.That afternoon we went down   
 Firtree Avenue with our boards for the
 Domesday Project.We looked at all the 
 houses then came back to school.      </content>
