		<title>14A Typical Day cont.</title>
		<content> During the afternoon we work at many  
 different things.We often have indoor 
 P.E.or if it is sunny we play         
 rounders,which we all enjoy.We also   
 listen to stories or write our own,as 
 well as studying different countries  
 and life long ago.My most enjoyable   
 time is when we have art and my best  
 day is when we have the computer in   
 the room.We go home at half past      
 three.                                
 As soon as I reach home I change my   
 uniform for play clothes.If it is     
 raining I stay in and read or watch   
 the television,otherwise I go out to  
 play with my friends or we go to club.
 I have my tea about half past six then
 I usually stay in and watch           
 television.If I'm lucky I go to my    
 friend's house and we play games on   
 the computer.I'm usually in bed by    
 half past eight and asleep by nine.   </content>
