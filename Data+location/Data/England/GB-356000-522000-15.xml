		<content>    Several traditional village        
 tradesmen exist in the area such as   
 joiner, cabinet maker,builder,        
 plumber and electrician. There's a sub
 post office and a village shop with   
 tea rooms and craft shop.             
    Two agricultural contractors       
 provide a valuable service to local   
 farmers throughout the year doing all 
 the seasonal jobs for the smaller     
 farmers at a market rate.They are     
 particually busy at the time of silage
 making and at harvest time.           
    Most of the forest plantations are 
 owned by Lowther Estates who thin out 
 the pine and larch for fencing or     
 timber trade and also a Christmas tree
 trade is carried out.                 
    A small but valuable industry of   
 providing hunting, shooting and       
 fishing for tourists is also carried  
 on by Lowther Estates.                </content>
