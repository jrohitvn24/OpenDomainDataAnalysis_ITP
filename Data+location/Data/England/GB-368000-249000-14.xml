		<content> There is no doctor or dentist in the  
 area. Most people travel to Bromyard  
 to surgeries there. People needing    
 hospital treatment are referred to    
 hospitals in Hereford, Worcester, or  
 Malvern. Bromyard hospital is for     
 geriatics, though it also has an      
 outpatients physiotherapy department, 
 well used by local people. Some       
 elderly residents are collected twice 
 a week by ambulance and taken to the  
 Day Hospital in Bromyard. Here they   
 may receive physiotherapy, baths,     
 hairdressing, lunch, and an           
 opportunity to meet other people which
 they might not otherwise have. People 
 may be visited in their homes by a    
 community nurse, and domiciliary      
 occupational and physio therapists.   
 Home helps are provided for the sick  
 and elderly. Expectant mothers attend 
 ante-natal clinics in Bromyard.       </content>
