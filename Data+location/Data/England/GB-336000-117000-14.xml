 I got up,dressed &amp; went downstairs for
 breakfast.I had fried egg &amp; bacon to  
 eat.                                  
 Dad &amp; I went to the television shop to
 rent a video tape.After that I did    
 some school work &amp; then I went over   
 the road to see my friend Siobhan.    
 Siobhan,James (her brother) &amp; me went 
 for a walk to the woods.When we got   
 home we watched the video film.       
 After some supper,I went upstairs to  
 have a bath.I put on my pyjamas,      
 cleaned my teeth &amp; went to bed.
