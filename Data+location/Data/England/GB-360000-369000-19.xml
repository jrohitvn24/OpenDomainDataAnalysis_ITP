		<title>19TOYS AND GAMES IN SANDIWAY</title>
		<content> After doing a small survey the        
{favourite}toys in this school seem to 
 be{star wars figures, dolls, and teddy
{bears.}Here is a small account of each
 one, first star wars figures. Star    
 wars figures are plastic figures about
 9cm high. They are characters out of  
 films, either{Star Wars, Empire       
{Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi. }
 You can also get weird creatures and  
 space vehicles. They have movable arms
 and legs and can be put into lots of  
 different positions.{Dolls}are usually
 plastic with nylon fibre hair, some   
 wet their nappies! some can talk and  
 some you can dress up.{Teddy bears}are
 made out of{wool}and other things made
 to look like wool, they have plastic  
 noses and eyes and don't do much!     
 I think that in{100}years time toys   
 and games will be very different, they
 may even have{minds! }                </content>
