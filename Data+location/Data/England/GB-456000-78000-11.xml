 I think that Shanklin will be very    
 different in 2085.I think that the    
 shops will be bigger and that one shop
 will sell everything. I expect more of
 the cliff above Horseledge Point and  
 Luccombe Bay will have fallen into the
 sea. Another church may be built with 
 a very modern steeple. This           
 school,Shanklin C.E.Primary,          
 will probably still be here, but      
 there will be many more computers and 
 calculators. I do not think they will 
 use the school bell or whistles any   
 more. Children will use typewriters   
 rather than pencils and the secretary 
 might use a computer with a printer.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
