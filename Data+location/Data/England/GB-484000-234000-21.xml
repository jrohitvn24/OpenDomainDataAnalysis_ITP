<title>21Milton Keynes Bowl</title>
<content>Milton Keynes Bowl was renamed to the National Bowl in 2000. It currently has a capacity of 65,000 people. In the last decade it has had many big acts from a broad range of popular music including; The Prodigy (2010), Take That (2006), Linkin Park (2008), Bon Jovi (2006) and many more. The Bowl consists of a grassy bank where people can sit with the stage in the centre and two large screens to both sides. Food vendors sell a variety of convenience foods. I have seen two concerts at the bowl; The Foo Fighters and The Prodigy. Both events were capacity crowds and amazing atmosphere (especially after sunset) with what seemed the entire youth of Milton Keynes in attendance.&lt;br />
