		<title>07N.FERRIBY'S LOCAL SHOPS.</title>
		<content>    People tend to shop in five areas  
 these are North Ferriby, Hessle,      
 Hull,Beverley and elsewhere.          
   In the main North Ferriby is used   
 for fresh vegetables,medicines and    
 toiletries, meat,bread and biscuits.  
   While shoes, shirts, dresses,       
 furniture and cars are bought         
 elsewhere. This is reflected by the   
 shops which are centered in three     
 areas(a)High Street (the main road    
 into North Ferriby)                   
      (b)Low Street (complimentary to  
 the High Street but traditionally for 
 the poorer people).                   
       (c)Church Road (opposite to     
 the church)                           
   On the High Street there is the     
 Off_licence,estate agent and building 
 society,newsagent,hairdresser and     
 Co_op.
