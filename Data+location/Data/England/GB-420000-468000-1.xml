		<title>01PENNINES - WEST OF RIPON</title>
		<content> The block is typical of the changing  
 landscape as the farmland of the York 
 plain gradually merges into the hill  
 farming country and heather grouse    
 moors of the Pennines. Sheep and      
 cattle grazing predominate. There is  
 no arable farming. Fields are small   
 usually enclosed by dry stone walls.  
 Farm buildings are small, usually     
 sited in such a way as to be          
 protected, as far as possible, from   
 the severe winter weather. A small    
 reservoir, managed by the Yorkshire   
 Water Authority, is supplied by small 
 streams running off the heather moors 
 to the west, the small hamlet of      
 Grantley comprises approximately 12   
 houses, one public house, one primary 
 school, one chapel, telephone box and 
 post box. Coniferous and deciduous    
 trees abound. There us a small wood   
 yard.                                 </content>
