		<content> Friday.     Mum wakes me up. I get    
 washed and dressed while mum helps my 
 younger sister. I usually have Corn   
 flakes &amp; a cup of tea for breakfast   
 then brush my teeth and go to the     
 toilet.I brush my hair, get my bag &amp;  
 then wait for the school bus.The bus  
 keeps stopping for the other children.
 When we get to school we chatter      
 outside until the bell goes at 9am. We
 line up &amp; the teacher tells us to go  
 in.I am in Class 3.(the Headmaster's  
 class.) After the register we have    
 assembly in the hall,then Hymn singing
 and Music.Afterwards we usually do    
 topic work about a period in history. 
 Playtime is at 10.30 &amp; lunch at 12. I 
 have a school lunch and am a server.  
 In the afternoon we have a spelling   
 test and then a Games lesson. The day 
 ends with a General knowledge quiz &amp;  
 Story. I help on the Farm after school</content>
