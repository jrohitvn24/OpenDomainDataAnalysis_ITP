		<content> At school we play such games as :     
 rounders, British Bulldog, Kick the   
 can.We play such games like non-stop  
 cricket,stool ball and badminton.We   
  play dodge ball,netball, and foot    
 ball outside.In side we play          
  chess, snakes and ladders, ludo,     
 jigsaws etc. All these mentioned are  
 "school" games but we play other games
 which we organise ourselves such as : 
 Across the bottom, Rotten Egg, Golden 
 River and Tiggy.Golden river this is  
 the way to play it. You get about ten 
 people. One of them stands in the     
 middle of the space and the rest      
 stands at the side. The person in the 
 middle calls a colour.Then if the     
 people at the side have that colour on
 they go across to the other side and  
 the rest run across. If the person in 
 the middle catches one of them. that  
 person is "on" and it just carries on.</content>
