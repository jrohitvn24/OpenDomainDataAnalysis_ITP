		<title>01The Village</title>
		<content>  It is a small quiet village just two 
 miles north of Thirsk.There is one    
 main road through the village.In the  
 centre of the village is Saint        
 Wilfred's church built in the 12th    
 century.It only has a bit of stained  
 glass.The graveyard is quite small.   
 Just outside the church is the village
 green where on bonfire night the      
 village bonfire is held.              
 There is one junction it is near the  
 green.Along that road there are some  
 new houses on the right and some older
 semi-detatched houses on the left.If  
 you keep going you come to Upsall.The 
 road to Upsall is quiet and the fields
 on each side are used mainly for      
 crops.                                
 Just after the junction on the left   
 there are some detatched houses and a 
 few semi-detatched houses a woodwork  
 shop and goats milk for sale and a bed</content>
