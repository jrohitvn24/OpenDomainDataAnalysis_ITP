		<content>    I play football, a very popular    
 game in our country.  There are four  
 leagues.  Leagues are sorts of teams. 
 The teams score points: three if you  
 win, one if you draw and none if you  
 lose.  The team with the most points  
 wins.  Another popular sport is rugby:
 instead of always kicking the ball, as
 in football, a player can run with it 
 to the other end of the grass.  A     
 football is round but a rugby ball is 
 oval.  To score in football the ball  
 has to be kicked through the goal, but
 in rugby the goal is made of wood     
 shaped like a letter "H".  In rugby   
 the captain throws the ball into the  
 middle of a circle of players.  The   
 two teams dive for the ball and try to
 run with it to the goal at the far end
 of the pitch.  The person with the    
 ball throws it.
