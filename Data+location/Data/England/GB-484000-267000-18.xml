		<content> The western side of Wellingborough has
 seen great changes since the 1960's.  
 An arrangement with the G.L.C. to     
 house London overspill resulted in    
 what was agricultural land being used 
 for building. Later, builders embarked
 on new private housing estates to     
 house the influx of people not only   
 from London, but also other parts of  
 the country. The setting up of the    
 Enterprise Zone is the latest part of 
 the expansion of Wellingborough in    
 this area. Housing is a mixture of    
 Council, private and housing          
 association ownership. Prices of      
 houses range from Â£15000 for a one    
 bedroom flat to Â£60000 for a 4 bedroom
 detached house. Joint ownership       
 schemes are available on some         
 properties to help people with the    
 purchase of property.
