		<title>17Transport:Peter Tavy Area</title>
		<content> Buses are the only form of public     
 transport in this area.Over half the  
 people interviewed think that public  
 transport is unsatisfactory.People use
 buses for school,work and social      
 reasons.People use buses daily,weekly,
 monthly or only rarely.Those who use  
 buses daily are school children who go
 on the school bus.People who use buses
 weekly in Peter Tavy go on the one bus
 which goes to Tavistock every Friday  
 morning and returns in the afternoon  
 as it is market day in Tavistock.     
 People living on the A386 have a more 
 frequent bus service as a bus goes    
 four times daily from Tavistock to    
 Brentor.This does not affect the      
 proportion of people using it or who  
 are dissatisfied with it.Most families
 have between one and three cars but   
 some have none.
