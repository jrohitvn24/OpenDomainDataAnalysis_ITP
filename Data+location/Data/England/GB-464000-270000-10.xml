		<content>The church of Saint Denys has stood    
here for 800 years,but the present     
building of brown ironstone dates from 
the 13th and 14th centuries.It is in   
good condition apart from the stone    
weathering outside.The absence of a    
Lord of the Manor has meant that the   
interior is free from memorials,which  
adds to its attractive simplicity.There
is a massive iron bound chest about 400
years old with 6 locks.The silver      
chalice and patten,regularly used,date 
back to 1682. In 1982 the vicar wrote a
play about how the village subscribed  
to the chalice,and it was performed by 
church members.There is an extensive   
churchyard which is the parish burial  
ground with a corner set aside for the 
burial of ashes.The grounds are kept   
tidy by voluntary effort and it is     
hoped to repair the boundary wall in   
the near future.                       </content>
