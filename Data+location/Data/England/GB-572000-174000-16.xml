Cliffe's parish church of St.Helen's   
has a history dating to about 1260 when
the tower,nave and transept are thought
to have been built.But the             
ecclesiastical connections of the      
village go well beyond this.An original
name of Cliffe-at-Hoo was Cloveshoh    
where a church council of the          
Anglo-Saxons existed between A.D. 716  
and 825.The Kings of Kent and Mercia   
would have attended together with      
principal bishops.                     
The present church is faced with       
Kentish rag and flint in alternate     
courses.In 1862 the bells were recast  
and in 1864 two more were added making 
in all eight musical bells.
