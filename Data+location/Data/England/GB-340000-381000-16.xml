		<title>16SHOPPING SURVEY (continued).</title>
		<content>  Nine children carried out a survey at
 the  Crescent   shops.     Maxine  did
 Gourleys,Angela did the  Post  Office,
 Carl did Spendlove's the greengrocers.
 Jacqueline  did  the  chemist  and the
 hairdressers,  Tarnia did the butchers
 and the chandlers.   The Post Office's
 most  frequent  visitors  were elderly
 men.   The  most  frequent people into
 Gourleys were middle-aged women.   The
 most frequent into  the  chemist  were
 girls under 16.    The people who went
 into Spendlove's  were  mostly middle-
 aged women.    Young men were the most
 frequent visitors to the hairdressers.
 Elderly  women  visited  the  butchers
 most frequently &amp; also the  chandlers.
          The busiest shop was the Post
 Office because  it  was  pension  day.
 People  have  not  got  money to spend
 on their hair  so the hairdressers was
 the least busy. Written by class 4S.  </content>
