		<content>      On Tuesday the 14th. of May      
 we went to the {Herald Express}office 
 at Hele Cross with Mr.Murdin,our      
 teacher.The Herald Express is the     
 largest local daily newspaper in the  
 Torbay area.                          
      When we got there we went into   
 the reception and looked at some      
 photographs and an old printing       
 machine.Soon a man came,who told us   
 he was the Assistant Editor.First we  
 went to an office where everybody was 
 typing and on phones.We went to the   
 back of the room and asked            
 questions.After a few minutes we went 
 up to the main office where there were
 people on computers and phones.Then we
 went on to the printing machine.The   
 man told us that it printed 28,000    
 papers a day.Then we followed a belt  
 where the papers were sent to vans and
 delivered.                            </content>
