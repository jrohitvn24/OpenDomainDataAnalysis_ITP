		<content>   We conducted a survey on boys'      
 hobbies. We interviewed 20 boys from  
 the junior department of my school and
 13 boys from the infant department.   
 Reading was the most popular - 29     
 people read, swimming had 23 people,  
 football was third. The trumpet and   
 lamp collecting only had one.
