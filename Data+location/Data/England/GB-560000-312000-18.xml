		<title>18St.Germans School</title>
		<content> St.Germans school was built in 1879,  
 from funds raised locally. It has     
 served the younger children of the    
 area ever since, and now has 65       
 children aged 4 to 11, and 4 teachers.
                                       
 The original stone building is little 
 altered, but recently added false     
 ceilings inside cut the noise down.   
                                       
 The school used to have over 100      
 pupils, but numbers are steadily      
 declining. Few village families now   
 have young children, and there are    
 hardly any new houses being built, so 
 this trend is expected to continue.
