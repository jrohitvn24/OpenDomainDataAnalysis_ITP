		<title>19CHALFONT ST PETER VILLAGE</title>
		<content>Chalfont St. Peter is a thriving       
village, with many local activities    
taking place throughout the year. The  
church is obviously the centre of much 
activity, having strong links with the 
local Middle School. Each year the     
school and church jointly organise a   
summer fete, and the proceeds are      
halved. The local Community Centre     
hosts main activities such as a Red    
Cross Group, dance classes, local music
festivals etc. The St. Peter Players,  
an amateur dramatic society, also use  
the centre for some of their           
productions. The village has a library,
this too works in conjunction with     
local schools. The Middle School       
sometimes organises class trips to see 
how a library is run. The village      
boasts many shops within the main      
shopping street, the Market Place and  
a seperate shopping precinct.          </content>
