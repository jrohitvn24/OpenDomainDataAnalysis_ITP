		<content> Farmland, of an arable nature and     
 mainly given over to cereals (barley) 
 and root crops (sugar beet),          
 dominates.  Some land also produces   
 seasonal cash crops of soft fruits    
 (strawberries,raspberries,gooseberries
 ,blackcurrants,etc)and the untilled   
 land supports small numbers of beef   
 cattle. The other main feature of the 
 area is the A47 trunk road.  It runs  
 roughly east-west but plunges         
 southwards in order to by-pass East   
 Dereham.  The road joins Norwich (16  
 miles eastwards) with King's Lyndd (25
 miles to the west) though in summer it
 becomes a major holiday route for     
 tourists travelling via Norwich to    
 Great Yarmouth and the Norfolk Broads.
 Nearly all signs of settlement are    
 along this road.
