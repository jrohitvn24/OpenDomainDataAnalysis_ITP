		<title>12TRANSPORT TRADEGIES</title>
		<content>   {Rural transport is a major problem.
 The bus services are totaly inadequate
 for the village youth, getting them   
 neither to work nor to play - no buses
 after 5.30 pm. The only possible      
 transport to work in neigbouring towns
 or villages for a 16 year old school  
 leaver is the{motor bike}and the      
{accident toll is horrendous.          
    Deaths (3 youths killed within 3   
 months) amputations, brain damage, all
 have harrowed the village recently.   
 Parents must choose between banning   
 the motor bike and condemning their   
 children to{unemployment:}when they   
 relent, each cold wet winter evening  
 brings worry and waiting.             
   Even at 17 and car-drivers at last, 
 youth being reckless, the accident    
 level is still high. Hardly a week    
 goes by without some incident or      
 injury, whose consequences linger on. </content>
