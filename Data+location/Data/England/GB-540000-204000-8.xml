		<title>08HORTICULTURE-EPPING GREEN</title>
		<content> THE AREA AROUND EPPING GREEN HAS FOR  
 MANY YEARS BEEN WELL KNOWN FOR ITS    
 HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND SOFT FRUIT 
 GROWING.SHORTLY AFTER WORLD WAR II    
 MANY ITALIANS,MAINLY FROM SICILY      
 MIGRATED TO THE AREA,BRINGING WITH    
 THEM THEIR SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF    
 GROWING PRODUCTS UNDER GLASS.FOR A    
 TIME ALL WENT WELL.A READY MARKET WAS 
 ON HAND IN LONDON,AND THE IMMIGRANTS  
 INTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY.THE CROP
 WAS MAINLY TOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS.TWO 
 FACTORS HAVE LED TO A DECLINE IN THE  
 MARKET FOR SUCH PRODUCTS.FIRSTLY THE  
 IMPORTATION OF TOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS 
 FROM THE CONTINENT AT PRICES BELOW    
 WHAT IS ECONOMICALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE 
 AREA TO PRODUCE.SECONDLY THE PROPOSED 
 EXTENSION OF HARLOW NEW TOWN          
 TO A POINT CLOSE TO ROYDON.THE GROWERS
 THEREFORE AWAIT AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT  
 TO DETERMINE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.     </content>
