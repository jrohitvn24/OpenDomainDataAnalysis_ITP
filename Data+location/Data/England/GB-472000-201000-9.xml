		<content>   The landscape of numerous hedged    
 fields with occasional clumps of trees
 presents a typical English scene. A   
 gentle slope from Chinnor leads to a  
 mostly flat and low lying area. The   
 lowest point in our designated area is
 marked at 78 metres A.S.L. and the    
 highest is 116 metres. The soil is    
 strong clay and the lowest point of   
 the Chinnor-Thame Road frequently     
 floods. This road carries relatively  
 light traffic and vehicles have little
 visual impact.                        
   Buildings are predominantly of brick
 and stone with tiled roofs. Some of   
 the older buildings are thatched.     
 Chalk hills have provided the flint   
 often found in village cottages. Many 
 houses date back to mediaeval times.  
 Large modern estates are found in     
 Chinnor.
