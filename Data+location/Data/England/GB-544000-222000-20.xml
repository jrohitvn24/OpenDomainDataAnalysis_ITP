		<content>    This increased affluence and       
 mobility has also meant the end of    
 many village shops and services as the
 car owners are able to shop weekly or 
 even monthly at the supermarkets in   
 Bishops Stortford. Nevertheless a few 
 shops survive either because they are 
 specialised like the MG carparts shop 
 in Little Hadham or because they are  
 multi-purpose such as the Post Office 
 - stores at Farnham. There are also a 
 number of public houses as the motor  
 car allows people to travel long      
 distances for recreation. Drink       
 driving laws however may affect this  
 pattern in the future. Small primary  
 schools serve the local families such 
 as the school at Little Hadham. The   
 decline in local shops has hit the old
 and poor who do not have cars. The bus
 service has also declined in recent   
 years and this has led to isolation.  </content>
