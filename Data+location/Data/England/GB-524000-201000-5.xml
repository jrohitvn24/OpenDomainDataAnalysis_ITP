		<title>05Why I Like Potters Bar</title>
		<content> Potters Bar is a very nice place it   
 has plenty of shops. We have a        
 swimming pool called Potters Bar      
 swimming pool.It is quite a nice pool 
 for it has a tennis club and a squash 
 club and they are building a weight   
 room.They have nearly finshed it.There
 is also a cricket club also called    
 Potters Bar cricket club and opposite 
 the cricket club there is a tennis    
 club.I live in Byng Drive it is a very
 nice road and most of the houses are  
 bungalows but have had extensions     
 giving them upstairs. We are very     
 lucky because we are near most of the 
 everyday shops. Potters Bar has a lot 
 of very nice schools and a lot of very
 nice secondary schools.
