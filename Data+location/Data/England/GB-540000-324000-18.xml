		<content>{Long Sutton and Sutton Bridge.}When   
 children leave St.Nicholas C.P.       
 Lutton,to go to secondary school, they
 either go to The Peele Secondary      
 School,Lutton;Spalding Grammar School 
 for boys;Spalding High School for     
 girls.Some children choose to go to   
 the convent school in Wisbech, others 
 to the Sir John Gleed High Schools in 
 Spalding.Which ever secondary school  
 children attend,there is generally a  
 long bus journey involved,those       
 children travelling to Spalding from  
 Lutton Marsh leave home at 7.40 a.m.  
 and return home at approximately      
 5.00p.m.In winter this journey can    
 take much longer because of the remote
 nature of the countryside,and quite   
 often days at school are missed       
 because school transport is unable to 
 run.
