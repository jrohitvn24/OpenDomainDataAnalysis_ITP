		<title>10HELSBY MARSHES</title>
		<content> The area referred to locally as       
 Helsby Marshes consists of two marsh  
 areas namely Helsby Marsh and Lordship
 Marsh.  Before the building of the    
 Manchester Ship canal this large area 
 of flat land used to be flooded       
 because it lies below seal level.  The
 drainage ditches, which characterize  
 the area, were dug by the German      
 prisoners of war.  Although flanked on
 one side by industry, nowadays the    
 marshes provided a quiet haven for    
 birds, wildlife and people.  Bird     
 watching groups use the marshes       
 regularly and it is an ideal place for
 walkers, joggers and cyclists.  Much  
 of the land provides local farmers    
 with grazing land for their cattle and
 a small amount of wheat is grown.Many 
 people consider the area is gradually 
 being ruined by the spread of industry
 but there is still much wildlife.     </content>
