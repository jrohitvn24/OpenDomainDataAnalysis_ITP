		<content> Bank Farm is a mixed farm.It has not  
 been run by Mr and Mrs Halls family   
 for generations only since 1955.The   
 farm is 320  acres.It is very highly  
 mechanised.Mr Hall employs 3 men for  
 the work.They plant about 100 acres of
 barley.They have 130 milking cows and 
 130 heifers and calves.They start     
 milking at quarter to 4 in the        
 afternoon.The animal fodder is mostly 
 home grown,things like                
 hay,barley,silage and straw,but things
 like dairy nuts and concentrates are  
 bought in.The cattle have the amount  
 of feed depending on how much milk    
 they give.They own 5 tractors.The     
 farm house is 150 years old.Some      
 people say it was built on a          
 moat,because it has a big dip all     
 around it.They have lots of wildlife  
 around,but mainly                     
 rabbits,pheasants,partridges and duck.</content>
