		<title>04What we like about Walsden.</title>
		<content>     Many Walsden residents were asked 
 to identify the main features of their
 district. The responses to this are   
 varied.                               
     The feature which came out as     
 foremost was the physical aspects of  
 the area, the hills, the Pennine Way  
 which passes in the hills above       
 Walsden, the views and the valley     
 sides. Various sports clubs, notably  
 Walsden Cricket and Bowling Club, came
 as the next most popular feature. The 
 work places and the Garden Centre came
 next, followed by St. Peters church,  
 which is well supported by local      
 residents.                            
     The communication network; the    
 road, rail and canal system were      
 identified as the next feature which  
 typified the district and this was    
 followed by the friendliness of local 
 people and the village spirit.        </content>
