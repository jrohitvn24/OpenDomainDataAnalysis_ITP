		<title>20The Jolly Abbot</title>
		<content>    During the period of the survey the
 manager of the Jolly Abbot public     
 house is based there in a temporary   
 capacity. The pub's name comes from   
 the family who owned the land on which
 the Abbots Farm Estate has been built,
 not because of any monastic           
 connections.                          
    The pub has many regular customers.
 They are mainly in the age range      
 eighteen to twenty five and a lot of  
 them are on the dole. Those who are   
 employed have a variety of jobs such  
 as secretary, computer sales assistant
 and working in a large electrical     
 components factory.                   
    During the winter it is mainly     
 local people who visit the pub but in 
 the summer many people from outside   
 the area come to the pub to use the   
 beer garden.                          
                                       </content>
