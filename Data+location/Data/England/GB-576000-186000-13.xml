		<title>13Architecture in Sth Benfleet</title>
		<content> House styles recall the development of
 Benfleet,but the replacing of old     
 windows and doors with double_glazing 
 is making the dating of domestic      
 architecture difficult. Many houses   
 still hold clues:Tall houses with     
 long,vertical sash windows point to   
 the development at the turn of the    
 century.The detached small wooden     
 holiday bungalows in large gardens    
 were built in the Twenties.The        
 Thirties brought all_electric brick_  
 built bungalows and houses with       
 horizontal Crittal windows and sunray 
 motifs, with a few avant_garde houses 
 with flat roofs.This style was        
 continued after the war with cavity   
 walls a new feature.Mock Georgian was 
 the style of the Seventies and has now
 been replaced by a vernicular Arts and
 Craft style,influenced by the Essex   
 Design Council.                       </content>
