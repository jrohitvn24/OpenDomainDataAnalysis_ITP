		<content>  Our Post Office is at Staunton Cross.
 The sub-postmaster is Mr Marshall. He 
 also owns the village stores and he   
 sells and delivers newspapers and     
 magazines. Until 1979, the letters for
 our area were sorted at our post      
 office but now they come sorted from  
 Gloucester. We have postmen who take  
 it in turns to do different rounds in 
 their vans. Letters are collected at  
 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. and are taken to   
 Gloucester for sorting.               
 We have a telephone exchange in a     
 brick building near Staunton Cross. It
 is called Staunton Court and the STD  
 code is 045284. There is a public     
 telephone box in Corse.
