		<content>  A YOUNG LOCAL DAIRY FARMER SPOKE     
 ABOUT CHANGES HE CAN REMEMBER: MILK   
 CHURNS HAVE GONE AND HAVE BEEN        
 REPLACED BY BULK TANKS; THIS MEANS    
 LESS LIFTING FOR THE FARMER.MILK      
 PARLOURS ARE REPLACING THE MILKING    
 BALE, SO THAT IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE  
 MOVED FROM FIELD TO FIELD. THE PARLOUR
 IS WARMER AND DRIER IN WINTER, BUT    
 FIELDS HAVE TO BE CLOSE BY.           
  BY LAW, TRACTORS NOW HAVE TO BE      
 FITTED WITH SAFETY CABS, SO THAT IF   
 THEY ROLL OVER, THE DRIVER WILL NOT BE
 CRUSHED.                              
    SILAGE IS BEING MADE MUCH MORE     
 THESE DAYS; BIG BALE SILAGE IS ALSO   
 BECOMING POPULAR; GRASS IS CUT WITH A 
 SPECIAL MACHINE, THEN COVERED WITH    
 BLACK PLASTIC BAGS.THE ADVANTAGE IS   
 THAT BETTER QUALITY FEED CAN BE MADE  
 WITH VERY LITTLE SUN, BUT IT IS       
 EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING          </content>
