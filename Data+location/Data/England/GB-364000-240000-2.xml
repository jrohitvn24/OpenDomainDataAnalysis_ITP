		<content> Ashperton village has no shop, no     
 post office and no bus service to any 
 shopping centre. It has two telephone 
 boxes, two post boxes and two public  
 houses. The nearest shop and post     
 office combined lies one mile to the  
 north, and there are four buses       
 during the day to Ledbury and four    
 to Hereford for anyone who is able to 
 walk a mile to the south and catch    
 them at the Trumpet crossroads. The   
 population is dependent on private    
 transport but there are many, both    
 old and young, without  their own     
 transport and these are isolated. The 
 bus companies claim that in these days
 of the private car it is not economic 
 to run regular services in country    
 areas. Two butchers deliver weekly in 
 the village and the shop in           
 Tarrington delivers groceries and     
 bread.                                </content>
