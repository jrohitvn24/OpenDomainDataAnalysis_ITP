		<title>10Community schools - 2.</title>
		<content> At Shevington courses are on all day  
 and all week, but at Standish the     
 community school is closed on Friday  
 and Saturday.  Only at Shevington is  
 the school library available to       
 commuity school students:             
 microcomputers are used by students at
 both, as are printers, disk drives and
 word processors.                      
 Anybody can enrol, they only have to  
 go along at the right time.  Although 
 neither school runs gardening sessions
 any more, Badminton is among the most 
 popular courses at both schools, while
 at Shevington horse-riding, keep-fit  
 for teenagers and English for adults  
 are very well attended.  At Standish  
 they have a Festival week in February 
 when many community school activities 
 are on show, and Shevington put on    
 exhibitions all through the year.
