 EFFCTS OF THE AIRCRAFT.SOMETIMES THEY 
 MAKE TILES FALL OFF THE ROOFS AND MAKE
 THE HOUSES RATTLE.                    
    IN CRANFORD THERE ARE LOTS OF BUSY 
 ROADS.BEFORE THE AIRPORT WAS THERE IT 
 WAS A VERY QUIET AREA TO LIVE IN.NOW  
 THERE ARE LOTS OF SHOPS AND OFFICES   
 SOME OF WHICH SERVE THE AIRPORT.THE   
 PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN CRANFORD FOR 
 A LONG TIME ARE PETTY USED TO THE     
 AIRPORT, BUT VISITORS FIND IT VERY    
 NOISY. .
