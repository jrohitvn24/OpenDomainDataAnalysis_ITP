		<title>14Cuxton Metals</title>
		<content> Cuxton Metals is a small business by  
 the River Medway near Cuxton Station. 
 It sells a variety of non-ferrous     
 metals such as brass, bronze, copper  
 and aluminium. The business is run by 
 two ladies and they sell 200 kg. a    
 day. Aluminium which is the most      
 sought after metal is used for        
 boilers. Copper is used for pipes and 
 brass for hooks. They have 2 machines,
 a saw and some scales. As they have no
 fork-lift truck they move the metal by
 hand. Most of the metals come from    
 abroad. Copper costs Â£1.90 per kg.,   
 brass Â£5.45 per kg., bronze Â£4.40 per 
 kg. and aluminium Â£1.90 per kg. They  
 try to stock as many different kinds  
 of metals as possible. The metals are 
 distributed all over Kent. Recently   
 the ladies entered a competition for  
 small businesses and came second.
