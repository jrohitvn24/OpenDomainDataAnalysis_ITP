     On the eastern side of Stapleton  
 Park is a small area known as "The    
 Brotherhood Church". They base their  
 beliefs on The Sermon on the Mount.   
     The Brotherhood was founded in    
 1921, and at that time there was quite
 a large group, but now only two       
 families live there regularly. They   
 grow much of their own food, and keep 
 bees. They sell the honey from the    
 commune.                              
     There is no church building as    
 such, but at time quite large         
 gatherings are held there. The day    
 before our visit, three hundred people
 had held a meeting there.             
     The group have strong connections 
 with the Peace Movement. There was a  
 banner saying "War is always wrong".
