		<content> Westmorland Rd is a main road so you  
 can always hear the buzz of traffic   
 especially at night when you try to   
 get to sleep. My neighbour on one side
 isn't very nice. When we try to watch 
 television the man next door gets his 
 electric lawnmower out.He mows his    
 lawn every other night. When we're    
 playing tennis and knock the ball over
 they don't give us our ball back. We  
 have a factory on the other side of   
 the street but it has been knocked    
 down now. My mom said she was glad    
 because it made her washing dirty!    
 When all the kids are coming home from
 school is the noisiest part of the    
 day. The quietest part of the day is  
 about 7.30-8.30 because none of the   
 parents will let their children play  
 by a main road.    Claire Johnson, 12
