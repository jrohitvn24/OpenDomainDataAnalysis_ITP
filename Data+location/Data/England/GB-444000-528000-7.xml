		<content> The garage on the northbound          
 carriageway of the A19 has facilities 
 for repairing vehicles and has its own
 breakdown truck. It is approved by the
 RAC and the AA.The garage sells and   
 also provides storage for caravans.   
 The garage shop sells car parts, oil, 
 cigarettes,sweets and soft drinks. On 
 the forecourt both petrol and diesel  
 oil can be purchased. The owner sells 
 only one brand of petrol and estimates
 that he disposes of 6,000 litres in a 
 day. The petrol tanker visits the     
 garage twice a week. Customers put in 
 their own petrol and then pay at the  
 shop. They receive vouchers for mugs  
 or glasses if they buy more than Â£5   
 worth of petrol. The garage which ahs 
 been open for twenty years serves up  
 to three hundred customers per day.
