		<content>   Most people who live in the village 
 are very happy with the quiet, rural  
 way of life.  Most people find the    
 limited small number of shops are     
 alright for simple needs but it is    
 necessary to visit the local towns for
 more variety.                         
                                       
   The major complaint in the village  
 is the poor{bus service}which is now  
 worse then it was forty years ago     
 with only four buses a day. Many      
 people have never used the buses and  
 do not ever expect to. The people who 
 suffer most from this lack of         
 transport are the young people who do 
 not have cars.                        
                                       
   The lack of recreational activities 
 for the young is another complaint    
 from many people.
