		<content> Garton and Tibthorpe Darby and Joan   
 Club was started in 1971 to provide   
 care, concern and entertainment for   
 elderly people.The club with          
 approximately 25 members meets once a 
 fortnight at Kirkburn Village Hall.   
 Two hostesses are responsible for tea 
 and cakes.Members play cards and      
 dominoes.There is a free raffle and   
 everybody wins something.             
 Other activities include a birthday   
 party in April, a summer outing, a    
 Christmas luncheon and visits to other
 D &amp; J clubs.Occasionally they attend a
 rally of all Humberside clubs.        
 In 1984 Tibthorpe withdrew and the    
 club was renamed Garton Darby and     
 Joan.Membership costs 20p a week which
 includes tea.Money is also raised by  
 jumble sales and whist drives.As      
 Garton does not have a village hall   
 transport to Kirkburn is a problem.   </content>
