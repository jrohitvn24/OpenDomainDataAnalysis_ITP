		<title>03Donington Park Race Track</title>
		<content> Donington Park Racing Circuit is      
 privately owned and was re-opened for 
 motor racing in 1977, having not been 
 used since before the 2nd World War.  
 Race meetings are held most weekends  
 throughout the summer and on some     
 weekends during the rest of the       
 year.There are two or three events a  
 year which attract crowds of 60-70000 
 people.                               
 With the ultimate aim of holding a    
 Formula 1 Grand Prix, the track has   
 recently been extended and work is in 
 progress to improve facilities for    
 spectators and competitors.           
 Throughout the year the circuit is    
 available for hire for the testing and
 practising of cars and motorcycles and
 is also used for promotional events.  
 It provides employment for 20 full    
 time staff and many casual staff on   
 meeting days.                         </content>
