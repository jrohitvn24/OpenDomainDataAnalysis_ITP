		<title>13Highbrook - Farming</title>
		<content> Much of the land is covered by        
 woodland leaving clearings of         
 grassland evenly scattered throughout 
 the area. Most of these clearings are 
 grazing land, occasionally ploughed   
 and reseeded but more often left and  
 grazed by sheep alone. Around         
 Highbrook are a few fields grazed by  
 dairy herds. These belong to the      
 working farm in the village itself.   
 Many fields are used by local affluent
 families for horses. To the south east
 are orchards of eating apples picked  
 in autumn by local hired labour. The  
 average size of field is unusually    
 small because of the relief and       
 delayed introduction of modern        
 intensive farming techniques. Most    
 hedgerows have been retained.         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
