		<content> The only place employing a number of  
 people in the village is the local    
 honey factory. About 20 persons are   
 employed in blending, bottling and    
 packaging honey, much of which is sold
 in the larger supermarekt chains as   
 well as to Health food shops. Golden  
 syrup and molasses are also botteld in
 the factory. Honey is imported from   
 all over the world, Mexico, China, New
 Zealand and many other countries. At  
 the factory it is cleaned, purified   
 and blended before being despatched to
 its various destinations.
