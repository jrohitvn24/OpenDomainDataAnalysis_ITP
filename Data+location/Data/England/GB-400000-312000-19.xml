		<title>19HAZELSLADE WILDLIFE RESERVE</title>
		<content>  At Hazelslade there is a{nature      
reserve}with a stream, marshes, a pool,
some deciduous woodland, some pasture  
land, a small meadow and a picnic area.
It has developed naturally over the    
last thirty years and it is popular    
with local fishermen who catch tench,  
perch, roach, rudd, gudgeon and carp.  
The stream provides a suitable place   
for these fish to lay their eggs and   
sticklebacks and bullheads also live in
it.                                    
  Around the pool there is marshy land 
used by dragonflies, butterflies,      
herons and even snipe. The woodland    
provides cover for foxes and hedgehogs 
and homes for wrens, robins, blue tits 
and great tits. Jays, magpies and green
woodpeckers can also be seen.          
  Of course, many other species of     
wildlife inhabit this area and it is   
well used by local people.             </content>
