		<content> Some of the landowners keep horses for
 riding but there are no stables where 
 horses can be hired for this purpose. 
 Game is preserved on some farm land   
 for the shooting of pheasants and     
 partridges. There is also rough       
 shooting of pigeons hares and rabbits 
 on farms in the area. Banger racing in
 old cars takes place in the NW of the 
 area regularly. For members of the    
 Caravan Club of GB there is a site at 
 Staines Farm. The Saffroin Walden     
 Rugby Football Club has a sportsground
 in the Sibleys area. Two houses have  
 private swimming pools and a lot of   
 people enjoy gardening and walking,   
 the latter usually with a dog as most 
 households have one or more dogs. We  
 note a Cutler's Green Womens'         
 Institute.
