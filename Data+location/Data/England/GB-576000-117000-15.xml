		<title>15Transport around Sedlescombe</title>
		<content> There are two main roads in the area, 
 running parallel to one another. The  
 A21 is the main London to Hastings    
 road with two roads leading from it to
 Battle. The other is the A229 which is
 the main Maidstone to Hastings road   
 and joins the A21 just south of the   
 village of Sedlescombe.               
                                       
 Public transport is minimal with      
 infrequent bus services to Battle and 
 Hastings.                             
                                       
 The main London to Hastings railway   
 line runs nearby, the nearest station 
 being at Battle.                      
                                       
 The Parish Council runs a private     
 'lift' scheme to help non-car owners  
 get to work, shops, hospitals, etc.   
 through the help of volunteer         
 car-owners.                           </content>
