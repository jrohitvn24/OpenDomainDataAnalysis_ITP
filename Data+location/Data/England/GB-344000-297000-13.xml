		<title>13Ecology in Lower Wood Area</title>
		<content>  The area is rich in animal and bird  
 life,providing homes for such species 
 as owls,thrushes,finches,tits and     
 wrens as well as foxes,badgers,hedge- 
 hogs and amphibians.There are many    
 small streams and ponds which seem to 
 be pollution-free and are therefore   
 healthy environments for wildlife.    
  The hedgerows are abundant in wild   
 flowers and native shrubs such as haw-
 thorn,holly and hazel although owing  
 to modern hedgecutters,sweet briar and
 honeysuckle are less common than in   
 the past.Cowslips,with which the      
 fields were once 'yellow over',are    
 struggling back and some primroses can
 be seen.Nature lovers regret the      
 decline of meadow plants such as      
 ragged robin,orchids and quaking grass
 In the dingles, sheets of bluebells,  
 clumps of yellow iris and marsh mari- 
 golds are now greatly reduced.        </content>
