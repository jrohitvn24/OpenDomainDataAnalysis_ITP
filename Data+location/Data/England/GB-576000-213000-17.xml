		<title>17RELIGION IN TERLING</title>
		<content> The first mention of a church in      
 Terling was in 1227.The church        
 registers date from 1538.Terling      
 Church on Church Green has a sundial  
 on the south wall in Greek, which     
 translated means "LOOK IN AND YOU SEE 
 YOUR FATE". At the present time there 
 are no stained glass windows in the   
 church. Services vary weekly to       
 include old and new forms of service, 
 with a Children's Church once a month 
 as well as a weekly Sunday School. The
 United Reform Church has existed since
 1662, when members broke away from the
 Church to worship at the Manse.The    
 present Chapel, the oldest in Essex,  
 was built on the Green opposite All   
 Saints in 1753. When they moved to the
 Chapel they brought with them the fine
 17th century clock, candelabra and    
 pulpit. Services are held fortnightly 
 by a Witham Minister for about ten.   </content>
