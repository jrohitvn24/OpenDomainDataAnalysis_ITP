		<title>10"Bowcombe"_Local Issues 1</title>
		<content>   Not surprisingly; the main local    
 issues reflect the differing          
 interests of the farmers and other    
 inhabitants and users of the          
 countryside. From the farmers' point  
 of view the most controversial issue  
 is the use of footpaths over their    
 land. Here there is a clear difference
 of opinion between the local Parish   
 Council at Shorwell who want more     
 footpaths, and the farmers who say    
 that they experience more than enough 
 trouble with the existing footpaths.  
   The main problem is the leaving open
 of gates; a criticism which was       
 strongly but reasonably expressed by  
 all the farmers in the area.          
 Furthermore, all those spoken to      
 identified the principle culprits as  
 horse riders and not walkers, though  
 members of the local hunt clearly took
 care to avoid such carelessness.      </content>
