		<title>09St Peter's Church, Ash.</title>
		<content>   This church was mentioned in the    
 first Domesday Book.The oldest parts  
 of the present church are the south   
 aisle, Lady chapel and the south      
 door.This is a fine example of Norman 
 stonework and makes a fitting entrance
 into a delightful church.In the 19th  
 century the church was enlarged and it
 can now seat 300 people .The windows  
 put in during rebuilding show stories 
 from the bible.Two smaller lancet     
 windows one in the south wall and one 
 in the north wall are much older.There
 is an unusual wooden octogonal font   
 and two mason jokes can be found on   
 stone work of the chancel arch.
