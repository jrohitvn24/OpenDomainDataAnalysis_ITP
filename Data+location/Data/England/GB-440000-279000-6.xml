		<content>  Brinklow's ancient mound is thought  
 to be older than Roman times and was  
 probably some kind of fortification   
 before 1066.A castle was built here in
 the 12th.century by{Roger de Mowbray  
 with a wooden stockade circling the   
 keep and surrounded by earthworks     
 which survive to this day.            
  Sometimes called the{"Tump"}it is a  
 well known landmark and is a popular  
 place for recreation.It also serves   
 the village school as a place for     
 environmental studies.Other schools   
 use these hills and during the summer 
 many parties of children of all ages  
 take advantage of the rich local      
 history.                              
  Access to the site has been made     
 easier recently by a lay-by,stile     
 and flight of steps.Climbers are      
 rewarded by fine view as it is the    
 highest point around.                 </content>
