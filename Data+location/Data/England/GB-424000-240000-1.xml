		<title>01SHIPSTON AND HONINGTON</title>
		<content>  This area is drained by the River    
 Stour flowing north to join the Avon. 
{ Shipston-on-Stour}is the dominant    
 settlement,being along the west bank  
 of the river.Deriving its name and    
 18th century prosperity from the wool 
 trade,it was once an important market 
 town.Much of the town is affected by  
 the heavy north-south traffic of A34  
 from Birmingham to Oxford.The town has
 grown considerably recently.400 new   
 houses have triggered a population    
 rise from 2100 to 3550 in 10 years    
  The town is outgrowing its attractive
 Georgian centre as far as shopping and
 car-parking are concerned.            
  North-east of Shipston lies{Honington
 with a population of about 120.This   
 pretty village is dominated by        
 Honington Hall (17th c).              
  Thinly populated farmland,mainly     
 arable,surrounds these settlements.   </content>
