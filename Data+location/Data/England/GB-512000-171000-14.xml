		<title>14ALL ABOUT FOOD I LIKE</title>
		<content> Fish and chips is a nice food. You    
 can get it in a fish and chip shop.You
 can get savaloy and chips, cod and    
 chips, pie and chips and battered     
 sausage, coka cola and other          
 drinks.Sometimes you can go to a      
 chinese restaurant to eat. You can get
 wun-tun soup, su-mai, char-soo, beet  
 in oyster sauce, sweet and sour pork, 
 crispy duck, rice. In English         
 restaurants you can get fish and      
 chips, scampi and other things. You   
 can also get crisps, chocolate, ice   
 cream and cakes. For my dinner I have 
 rice and other things. On Sunday we   
 have roast beef or lamb with potatoes 
 and corn. Sometimes my dad goes to    
 Chinatown and buys su-mai,char-soo,   
 soy duck and rice roll. I like Chinese
 food. I hate English food. My mother  
 is Chinese and my father is British.
