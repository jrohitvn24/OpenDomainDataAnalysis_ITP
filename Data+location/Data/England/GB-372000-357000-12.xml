		<content>  The application to store potentially 
{dangerous chemicals}just outside      
 Sandbach was given the go-ahead last  
 week. It would mean allowing six 10000
 gallon liquid storage tanks to be     
 built. The former Crewe Chemical works
 opposite the canal on the west side   
 near the bridge. Members of the       
 Council thought that the Health and   
 Safety Department should have been    
 allowed more time to talk about the   
 plan.

 Britain's motorways said a panel of   
 experts who have travelled the        
 motorways in June 1985. The panel was 
 put together by the Milk Marketing    
 Board and the Tea Council to survey   
 the standard of tea and fresh milk in 
 the service stations all over Britain.
