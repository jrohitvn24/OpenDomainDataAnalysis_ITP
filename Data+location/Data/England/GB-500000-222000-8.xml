 I am Fr.Ellis.I take different        
 services such as weddings, funerals,  
 and blessings,baptisms, christenings, 
 and communions.I visit people in their
 houses if they are too sick or too old
 to come out.Sometimes I visit people  
 who have had babies or are sad, lonely
 &amp; frightened.At weddings &amp; communions 
 I wear my vestments and a special     
 scarf called a stole.Out of church I  
 wear a black or grey suit and a dog   
 collar to let people know who I am so 
 that they know it is safe to let me   
 in.The saddest time is when I am      
 taking funerals,some people cry out   
 loud and I try to calm them           
 down.Weddings are usually joyful but  
 when I go to hospitals I try to calm  
 people down and say prayers for their 
 lives.                                
                                       </content>
