		<content>  This urban area has at its centre the
 ancient village of Hreod Burna meaning
 red or reed stream.The stream still   
 runs through a pleasant grassy area   
 maintained by the council.Its modern  
 name is Rodbourne Cheney.The Cheney   
 family owned the{manor}after the      
 Norman Conquest.The sixteenth Century 
 manor house and part of the village   
 green survive surrounded by newer     
 developments.The{medieval parish      
{church}of St Marys is now by the      
 council estate of Moredon built in the
 early 1950s.Part of the old{Saxon     
 cross is built into the wall of the   
 church tower.In Victorian times clay  
 was dug  in nearby Plummers Pit  to be
 made into bricks.These were used for  
 building in the expanding railway town
 of Swindon.
