		<title>16THE BOXING DAY SWIM</title>
		<content> In Alnwick there is a swimming club   
 called Alnwick Dolphins.  Their       
 custom is that they swim in the sea   
 on Boxing Day at Alnmouth.  Before we 
 go in to swim we have a game of       
 football, rounders and hide the       
 cracker.  After we have played the    
 games we go into the sea.  Everyone   
 goes into the sea.  Some people just  
 paddle but other people go right in   
 and have a proper swim.  The sea is   
 very cold at that time of year.  After
 we have swum in the sea we go to a    
 restaurant called The Schooner to have
 soup, sandwiches and coffee to get    
 warmed up.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
