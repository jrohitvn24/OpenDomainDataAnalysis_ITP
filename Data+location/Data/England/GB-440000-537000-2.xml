		<content> Ever since Pre-Historic times people  
 have left some signs of their being   
 here.The Romans built no towns in the 
 Peterlee area although we have some   
 evidence of them passing through for  
 in the grounds of Shotton Hall a gold 
 bracelet weighing about two ounces was
 found.The Anglo Saxons built small    
 villages such as Old Shotton which was
 called Sceotton,the Scott             
 Village,Castle Eden called Geodene or 
 Yew Valley,Hesleden or Hesildene was  
 the Hazel Valley and Wingate once     
 called Windegat the Windy Road.The old
 Hesleden site is not in our area.When 
 the Saxons became Christians,the land 
 became Church property.In the 9th     
 century the Castle Eden area was ruled
 by the Danes,then the Vikings raided  
 our shores and started to settle      
 here.They left us parts of our local  
 dialects.                             </content>
