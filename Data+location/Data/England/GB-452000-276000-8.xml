 the Domesday Book:Newton had 6        
 villagers,4 smallholders and meadows  
 of 2.5 acres;total value 32s,Biggin ( 
 or Holme)had 2 villagers,2            
 smallholders,1 slave and 6 acres;value
 13s.Biggin no longer exists but       
 excavations in the 1950's revealed    
 remains of a dwelling surrounded by a 
 moat or water course.These depressions
 can still be seen today.In later years
 the G.C.R. built a line from Rugby    
 going north of Newton while the       
 L.M.S.R.'s line went via the south    
 side.Both were abandoned and land is  
 now owned by the council for leisure  
 walks,picnic area and car park.The    
 original St. Thomas's Cross was sited 
 opposite the present pub.Stones said  
 to be from it are to found at Manor   
 Farm and behind the Post Office.
