		<title>01WINNARD'S PERCH/NINE MAIDENS</title>
		<content>  This is an area of{upland}that is    
 dominated by the roads running through
 it.The land to the east is rough      
 ground and unenclosed whilst to the   
 west there is more intensive farming. 
  The{main road}that links the northern
 coast of Cornwall with the major      
 inland centres cuts through this D    
 block and in summer has busy traffic. 
 The road at{Winnard's Perch}has been  
 improved by a roundabout.             
  Evidence of{pre-historic}man is      
 plentiful.There are well over two     
 dozen tumuli (burial barrows) and     
 strange{sarson stones,}the most famous
 of which are the{Nine Maidens.        
  Unfortunately this is an area people 
 quickly pass through on their way to  
 somewhere more attractive.{Rosenannon,
 set in a small valley, is only hamlet 
 in the area.The name means "heath of  
 the ash-tree"                         </content>
