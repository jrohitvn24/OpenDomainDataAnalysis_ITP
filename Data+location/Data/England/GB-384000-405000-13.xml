		<title>13EDUCATION IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content>  In Middleton there are 3 Nursery     
 schools, 18 Primary Schools (including
 5 C of E &amp; 4 RC), 3 Junior High       
 Schools (11-14), 2 Senior High Schools
 (14-18+) &amp; 2 R.C Secondary Schools.   
  In Primary Schools basic skills in   
 English and Maths are taught in an    
 informal setting with time given to   
 thematic work. At 11+ children        
 transfer to Junior High Schools, where
 subjects include Arts, Humanities,    
 Languages, Science, Craft, Design and 
 Technology. At 14+ they go to Senior  
 High Schools which have courses       
 leading to C.S.E. &amp; G.C.E. "O" &amp; "A"  
 Level examinations. At present        
 reorganisation of education in the    
 area is being discussed.              
  Extra help is given to children with 
 special needs. Pastoral care involves 
 teachers backed up by Psychologists,  
 Welfare Officers and Health Visitors. </content>
