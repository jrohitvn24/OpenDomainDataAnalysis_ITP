   At 3.45pm it is time to go home.As I
near my house I tip toe the last bit so
as not to set Bobby barking TOO        
LATE.Mum says "Would you like a cuppa?"
"Yes please," I reply."We had maths    
again today" "Never mind,we had maths  
everyday when I was at school". In the 
evening after my tea I go to The Tarn ,
our local park. It is a bird sanctuary 
too.The Anerican lady,who is interested
in birds is not there so I go home. On 
the way I saw some friends so we play  
till I have to go home. It is a school 
day tomorrow so I have to go  to bed at
about half past nine. I lay thinking   
about the day till I fall asleep.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
