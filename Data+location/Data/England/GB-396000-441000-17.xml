		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY MIDDLETON</title>
		<content>{MIDDLETON}is one of the older areas   
 within the Cowling Parish.It is just  
 a street of cottages which were built 
 by quarry workers for themselves.The  
 cottages are all a different design   
 and look different inside too.When    
 they were built there was no mains    
 water and many of the houses had a    
 well in the cellar.Some of the        
 cottages became shops,and at one time 
 there was a butcher,Post Office,      
 greengrocer,Co-op and hairdresser.    
 The allotments which had been allowed 
 became gardens after the Second World 
 War.One of Cowling's most famous sons 
 was{Philip Snowden, }who became       
 Chancellor of the Exchequer in the    
 first Labour Government of 1923. He   
 used to live in a small cottage in    
 Middleton,which now has a plaque to   
 remember him.
