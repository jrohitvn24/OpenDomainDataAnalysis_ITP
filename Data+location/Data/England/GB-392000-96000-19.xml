		<content>    Henbury farm is a large{Victorian  
{farmhouse,}entered through the        
 farmyard. The farm has 240 acres,     
 growing bulbs, potatoes and there is  
 a herd of 100 dairy cows. The milk    
 and potato quotas inhibit expansion.

 lifted and sterilised are sold to     
 growers in Holland.

{depression and frustration over EEC   
{policies and interference.
