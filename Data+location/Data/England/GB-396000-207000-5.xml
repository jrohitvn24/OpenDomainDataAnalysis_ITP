		<title>05THE CHURCH , WINSTONE</title>
		<content> In Winstone the church is on the SE   
 outskirts of the village. It is called
 St Bartholomew's.Built after the      
 Norman Conquest, it is very plain     
 compared with other churches.Inside   
 about 70 people can be seated and on  
 each pew are beautifully decorated    
 kneeling cushions .At one end of the  
 church is a 15th Century font and in  
 the saddleback tower are three        
 bells,two of which are Medieval.      
 As you enter the churchyard there is  
 an ornate gate with a lamp above. The 
 graveyard contains a 14th Century     
 Stone cross .The setting is typically 
 Medieval with the Manor Hall next door
 (now Manor Farm,converted into 3      
 cottages).                            
    At the other end of the village is 
 a Baptist Chapel which people said was
 well attended.                        
                                       </content>
