		<content> If the 12 square block were treated as
 one square, the major land cover would
 be {Farmland.                         
                                       
 The major and indeed only industry is 
 farming. This farming is mainly the   
 growing of{cereal crops}then sheep    
 farming followed by dairy farming.    
                                       
 Even allowing for crop rotation it is 
 unlikely that it would be any         
 different. Notably absent among crops 
 are fruit trees and hops.             
                                       
 The block contains two{recreation     
 areas both wooded, one known as{The   
{Warren}and the other, looked after by 
 the{Nature Conservancy Trust,}known as
{Hothfield Common,}a popular picnic    
 spot.
