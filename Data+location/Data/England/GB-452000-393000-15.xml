		<content> The Yorkshire Countrywomens           
 Association, formed in 1983, aims to  
 further the skills,knowledge and      
 social activities of its members and  
 to preserve the heritage of Yorkshire.
 The Darby and Joan Club is an         
 extension of the W.R.V.S. The         
 Braithwell group was formed in 1947.  
 Its object is to provide entertainment
 and company for pensioners and lonely 
 people. The Good Companions have been 
 helping people in need in the local   
 community, since 1966, such as        
 arranging transport for hospital      
 appointments and visits to patients.  
 At Christmas each Senior Citizen is   
 given a monetary gift. Many sick      
 people benefit from the generosity of 
 the Community  Association, formed in 
 1967, primarily to raise funds for the
 church. Girl Guides &amp; Brownies        
 use the porta cabin on the field.     </content>
