		<title>01Valley north east of Ludlow</title>
		<content> The block covers the lower slopes of  
 hills in the west, the little narrow  
 valleys of the Ledwyche Brook and     
 tributary streams, Newton, Bockleton  
 and Dogditch Brooks and some of the   
 rising ground of Brown Clee and       
 Titterstone Clee hills.  It is highest
 in the NE at 330m above sea level and 
 lowest in the SW in the valley about  
 152m and the general slope is this    
 way.  The main route, the Ludlow to   
 Bridgnorth road, B4364 keeps to the   
 higher land papallel to the valleys,  
 diagonally across the block.  There   
 are no village settlements in the     
 area, but a few stone cottages, some  
 houses and bungalows along the roads  
 and farms spread about.  The farming  
 is pasturing of sheep and beef cattle 
 and arable.
