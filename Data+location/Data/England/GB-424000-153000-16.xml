		<title>16THE RAILWAY LINE</title>

 It was called the Midland and South   
 Western Railway. It ran from Andover  
 to Andoversford in Gloucestershire.   
 The railway was opened throughout in  
 1883 and closed in 1961. To start with
 it was a busy railway connecting the  
 Midlands with Southampton. The line   
 was very important in both world wars,
 and was used for transporting large   
 numbers of troops and equipment.      
 After the war fewer people used the   
 railway because there were more cars, 
 and goods were moved by road          
 transport.Much of the railway line can
 still be seen though many of the      
 bridges have been knocked down.Farmers
 use parts of the line for storing     
 silage and the County Council use the 
 old station for storing materials.Part
 of the line has been restored between 
 Swindon and Cricklade.                </content>
