		<content>  There are two main breeds of sheep   
 which are common in this area. The    
 first of these is the Cheviot(South   
 Country) Sheep.                       
 This breed does best on coarse grass  
 rather than heather and is a good lamb
 producer. Both sexes are hornless.    
                                       
 The Scottish Blackfaced Breed does    
 better on the heather moorlands. Both 
 ewes and rams have horns. They are    
 reared mainly for meat. There are     
 several other breeds suited to this   
 arealike the Swaledale,  Jacob,       
 Suffolk, Border Leicester and the     
 Texel. These are pure bred.The two    
 main cross breeds are the mule which  
 is a Blackface Ewe crossed with a     
 Bluefaced Leicester Tup.The second    
 cross breed is  a half bred which is  
 a Border Leicester crossed with a     
 south country Cheviot.                </content>
