		<content> BAYNARD'S COUNTY PRIMARY SCHOOL       
 In the education year 1984/5 there    
 were seven teachers and 210           
 children.Along with the national trend
 the numbers are declining.            
 The grounds are well landscaped.Grassy
 mounds built round the edge of the    
 playing field help to disguise the    
 fact there is a busy road running     
 alongside.These mounds are covered    
 with many varieties of trees.         
 1976 was one of the very hot summers  
 and drought conditions                
 prevailed.Hosepipes were banned but   
 the school was given a special        
 dispensation by the local water       
 authority to water the trees in order 
 to keep them alive.Fortunately this   
 constant watering worked and only a   
 few trees were lost.
