		<content>   The Milton Keynes Bowl is just north
 of Bletchley on the A5 trunk road.The 
 Bowl is a man made place, everywhere  
 you look there are trees and bushes.  
   The Bowl is shaped like a half moon 
 about three hundred metres wide and   
 there is a big space in the middle.   
 Lots of people go there for bike rides
 and picnics and to watch American     
 Football,Jousting,Cycle Races         
 Parachuting,Half Marathons and the    
 Great Balloon Race.                   
   Alongside the Bowl there is a       
 stream which runs into Loughton Valley
 Park where there are three lakes and  
 picnics parks.The Milton Keynes Bowl  
 is an open air grass amphitheatre     
 built on the site of an old brick clay
 pit.The pit was filled with soil from 
 construction sites througout the city 
 and the amphitheatre was shaped from a
 soil heap.                            </content>
