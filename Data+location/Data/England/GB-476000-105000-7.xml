		<title>07LOCAL NEWS - READERS LETTERS</title>
		<content> Letters in our local papers seem to   
 deal with the social problems in the  
 local parishes and about vandalism and
 violence in our area.Other letters are
 about problems in the home,especially 
 about problems with sons and          
 daughters.                            
   National news is also discussed by  
 the areas inhabitants.The latest      
 teachers strike is debated in very    
 great detail by people with children  
 in secondary schools taking exams or  
 doing exam coursework.                
   Local elections are also discussed  
 in great detail.As well as letters    
 which discuss local news,there are    
 many letters of gratitude and thanks  
 from organisations and members of     
 clubs for help and support.
