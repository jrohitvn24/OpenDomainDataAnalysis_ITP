		<title>06ONE PARENT FAMILIES - ROMSEY</title>
		<content> I live with my mum who is divorced    
 from my real dad and has been for five
 or six years.  The main things a one  
 parent family worries about are money 
 and safety for their children on the  
 streets.  Nowadays there are hardly   
 any places for young children to play 
 and far too much vandalism.  It is    
 quite different and harder living with
 just my mum but we have coped very    
 well.  My mum has a boyfriend who has 
 done everything he can to make us     
 happy.  Most parents have jobs, either
 part time or full time, but there are 
 those who have no job at all.  Their  
 spare time is used up with hobbies or 
 outings with their children.  Some    
 people are on social security although
 my mum has two jobs, as a lollipop    
 lady and playschool teacher.
