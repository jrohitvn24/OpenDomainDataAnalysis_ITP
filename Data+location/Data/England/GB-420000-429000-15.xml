		<title>15RAIKES HALL RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>                                       
 When we interviewed Mr Hanson of      
 Schole Brook farm he mentioned that he
 had recently purchased the nearby     
 Raikes Hall farm where his wife and   
 married daughter run a riding school. 
 Mr Hanson describes the school as his 
 cash crop, bringing in a regular      
 income to replace the dairy herd.     
 There are 40 horses and Mrs Hanson    
 employs a fully qualified             
 instructress. More adults than        
 children use the stables and they are 
 mainly professional and business      
 people.                               
   Mrs Hanson also hires out three     
 hackney carriages each pulled by two  
 grey Welsh cobs,for weddings, and this
 employs the two sons and one extra man
 on Saturdays.                         
   Six donkeys are kept which compete  
 in'Donkey Derbies' at local fetes.    </content>
