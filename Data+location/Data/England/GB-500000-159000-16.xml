		<content>  Where Erin rides on the Common there 
 are many woods, most of which have    
 pine trees. Beside the paths on the   
 common there are lots of bushes and   
 trees. The paths are made of mud and  
 sometimes of stones. She belongs to a 
 Pony Club called Samsteads.           
  I ride at another stable on Horsell  
 Common_ Samber Pony Stud. It is owned 
 by Mrs Beryl Rae who lives at Shaw's  
 Farm. There are fields for grazing,   
 much grass and many muddy rough paths.
 There are lots of trees and sand and  
 the ponies shelter under the trees.   
  There is a white pony pen where Beryl
 gives lessons if it is raining and    
 where the ponies can have a rest after
 having been ridden.                   
  Samber was given its name by joining 
 the first parts of Samantha, Mrs Rae's
 daughter's name, and Beryl. Mrs Rae   
 takes part in Riding for the Disabled.</content>
