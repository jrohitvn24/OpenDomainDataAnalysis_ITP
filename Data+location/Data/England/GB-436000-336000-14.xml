		<title>14THE DARWIN YOUTH CLUB</title>
		<content>{Cont.}                                
 There have been incidents of vandalism
 at the youth club, ranging from the   
 destruction of small notices to the   
 setting fire of curtains.             
 The youth club is publicised by annual
 programmes which are distributed to   
 schools at the beginning of the       
 academic year in September. Teenagers 
 are allowed to smoke at the youth club
 although they are advised of the      
 dangers to their health and encouraged
 not to smoke.                         
 There are two youth clubs and a       
 special youth club also in the area.  
 The Lees Brook Youth Club is very good
 but the Derwent Club is small and ill 
 equipped. On the whole the Darwin     
 Youth Club is well run and well       
 attended by the youngsters in the     
 area.
