		<title>13The Strawberry Farm,St.Peter</title>
		<content> There has always been a farm on the   
 site but the last farm was demolished 
 by the Germans in 1942 and a bunker   
 was built. After the war an Australian
 started to grow strawberries and they 
 have been grown there ever since. The 
 present farmer is Theo Person. The    
 plants are ordered from England, the  
 main variety being Red Gauntlet. He   
 increases his plants by growing new   
 ones from the runners. If he needs    
 40,000 new plants he orders 10,000 and
 plants runners for two years. He has  
 new plants every three years. Some of 
 the plants have polythene around them 
 to keep the fruit clean, others have  
 straw which is the better of the      
 two. The same fertiliser is used as   
 for the potato crop. The strawberries 
 are hand picked every day and the     
 season is from April to October.
