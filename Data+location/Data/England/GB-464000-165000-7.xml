		<title>07BURGHFIELD-WILLINK SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Willink School was opened on 8th  
 January 1957,taking 11-15 year olds   
 who would have formerly gone to the   
 original Blands School,now the site of
 an old people's home.Designed to meet 
 the 1950s demand for new schools,the  
 Willink began as a secondary-modern   
 with 245 pupils and 11 teachers,headed
 by Mr N.Jackson.In 1957,the school had
 about 14 classrooms.The school motto  
 was that of H.Willink-"Fides et Amor".
  In 1973 the school became a compre-  
 hensive,and was extended.In 1985 the  
 school has about 820 pupils,including 
 a successful 6th form department.Sub- 
 jects range from the traditional ( eg.
 maths,english etc.) to the modern,    
 (computers,roadcraft,parentcraft etc.)
 The 48 teaching staff are now headed  
 by Miss M.Hulbert,as Mr Jackson       
 retired in 1982.The school catchment  
 area extends to Tadley and Pangbourne.</content>
