 The Roman town at{Wroxeter}was        
 called{Viroconium}and it was a        
 military outpost.There is now a museum
 where you can see rocks,bones and     
 skulls which have been excavated and  
 the entrance to the baths called the  
 north wall.This wall is made out of   
 sand stone and flat red bricks.       
 It is 28 metres long and about 8      
 metres high.There were nine baths     
 some cold and some heated.You can see 
 small pillars built to heat the       
 baths.Some of the rocks remaining have
 trade marks on them like a large thumb
 print,from the Romans who made them.  
 When the town was built it covered an 
 area of 170 acres making it the fourth
 largest city in Roman Britain.        </content>
