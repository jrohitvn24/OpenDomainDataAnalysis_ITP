		<title>09Patricroft - 19C Ind. area</title>
		<content> This is an area of mixed housing and  
 industry, mainly in decline except for
 engineering works and a large Royal   
 Ordnance factory. It developed rapidly
 in 1840-1850 using the Bridgewater    
 canal as its main transport link.     
 James Naysmyth, of steam hammer fame, 
 established his works here in         
 1840-1850. Most people both lived and 
 worked in the area. Long Victorian    
 terraces of red brick houses are now  
 being replaced by modern terraces of  
 local authority housing. It is bounded
 on the south side by the Manchester   
 Ship Canal. Many industries, including
 The Patricroft Engine Sheds of British
 Rail, have closed and unemployment in 
 the area is high. The area used to    
 have a high area of industrial        
 pollution, but since the Clean Air    
 Acts the area is cleaner.
