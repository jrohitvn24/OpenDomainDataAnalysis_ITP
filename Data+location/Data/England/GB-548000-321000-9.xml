		<title>09THE DOCKS</title>
		<content> This is the Dock that's slack-built,  
 This is the lock that was made for the
 dock that was slack built.            
 This is the silt that supported the   
 lock that was made forthe dock that's 
 slack-built.                          
 This is the water that scoured the    
 silt that supported the lock that was 
 made for the dock that's              
 slack-built....                       
 This is King's Lynn that crowed in the
 morn                                  
 To see old Guy of his glory shorn.    
 Who mourned with the merchant and all 
 forlorn,                              
 When they found the engineer laughed  
 to corn,                              
 For planning a bottom eroded and torn,
 Without any concrete,to hold the      
 water,that scoured the silt,that      
 supported the lock,that was made for  
 the dock that's slack-built.          </content>
