 Bowes Museum is the clockwork silver  
 swan.The museum has however the       
 largest collection of famous painting 
 outside London's National Gallery and 
 the most French and Spanish paintings 
 in England.A newly bought item is a   
 fabulous French writing desk decorated
 with Sevres plates.                   
 The Friends of the Bowes Museum help  
 to buy new items and there is a club  
 for children called the Junior Friends
 which meets in the holidays. The      
 museum's most important patron is the 
 Queen Mother,Elizabeth Bowes Lyon,who 
 is a descendant of John Bowes.Her     
 last visit to the museum was in

 exhibitions and has been called the   
 Taj Mahal of the north-east.
