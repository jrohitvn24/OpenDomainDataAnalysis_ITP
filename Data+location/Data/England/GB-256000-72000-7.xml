		<content> We play many games at school such as  
 One Knee, Mother I,Red Letter, Black  
 Jack and lots more.Some are fun.      
   Sevens is a game with a ball.       
 What you have to do is throw the ball 
 against a wall seven times without    
 letting it bounce. Next throw the ball
 against the wall, let it bounce and   
 catch it 6 times. Bounce the ball 5   
 times up and down on the floor.You get
 to number 4 and you have to let the   
 ball bounce on the floor and when it  
 rises hit it with your hand against   
 the wall and catch it.Do this 4 times.
 Number 3 is quite hard.You have to    
 throw the ball into the corner of the 
 wall so that it hits the floor and the
 wall. Number two,throw the ball under 
 your leg and catch it. Number one     
 throw the ball against the wall, turn 
 round and catch the ball without      
 letting it bounce. It is good fun.    </content>
