		<content> On the north western area of the block
 on the main road leading from Yarmouth
 is a row of mainly older houses facing
 seawards with views across the Solent.
   Most were quite big and we thought  
 would be expensive to buy. They were  
 of different styles and some looked   
 older than others.                    
   Further along the road was a group  
 of very new houses built of red brick.
 These were all very big and had       
 obviously been built about the same   
 time. They all had big windows which  
 looked out across the water.          
   Along the road still further on the 
 seawards side was a very big old house
 standing in big grounds.              
   This old house we discovered used to
 be a special school for difficult     
 children but we learned that the      
 school was to expensive to run and had
 been sold by the council.             </content>
