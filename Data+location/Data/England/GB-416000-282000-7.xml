		<content> MAGLEV IS A JOINT DEVELOPMENT BY THE  
 COUNTY COUNCIL,BRITISH RAIL AND       
 INDUSTRY. USING A FRICTIONLESS        
 MAGNETIC SUSPENSION,THE MAGLEV CARS   
 WILL BE DRIVEN BY LINEAR INDUCTION AND
 MOTOR ALONG A GUIDEWAY TRACK ELEVATED 
 OVER THE ROADS AND CAR PARKS.         
 THE PURPOSE OF MAGLEV IS TO LINK,WITH 
 EASY ACCESS,THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
 WITH THE N.E.C. AND IT TAKES 90secs TO
 REACH ONE FROM THE OTHER AT A SPEED OF
 30mph.                                
 MAGLEV STANDS FOR MAGNETIC LEVITATION.
 THE MAGLEV CAN HAVE FOUR PAIRS OF     
 ELECTROMAGNETS.THE MAGNETS REACT WITH 
 STEEL SUSPENTION WHICH THE RAILS ON   
 EACH SIDE OF THE T SHAPED TRACK ALSO  
 STEERS THE VEICHLE.                   
 THE CARS ARE CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER   
 ACCORDING TO PASSENGER FLOW,BUT       
 PASSENGERS CAN TALK BY RADIO IF NEEDS 
 BE TO THE SYSTEMS CONTROLLER.         </content>
