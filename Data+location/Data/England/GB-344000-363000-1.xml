		<content> Our survey area contains much of the  
 old ecclesiastical parishes of        
 Christleton and Waverton mentioned in 
 the Domesday Book together with the   
 village of Rowton.It retains a rural  
 character despite the recent growth of
 new housing estates.The land is       
 intensively farmed and there are      
 market gardens providing fresh produce
 for nearby Chester.The villages are   
 linked by a stretch of the Shropshire 
 Union Canal,the A41 Road and the      
 Chester-London Railway. Nearness to   
 Chester with its sources of employment
 and good communication with the rest  
 of Britain make the villages popular  
 places to live.This is helped by      
 having good schools and recreational  
 facilities.About 7000 people live     
 here,in houses of red brick and       
 sandstone,many with attractive gardens
 lining the banks of the canal.        </content>
