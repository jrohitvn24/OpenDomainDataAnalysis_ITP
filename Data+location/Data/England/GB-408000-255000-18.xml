		<content>     Arrow is a small hamlet on the    
 outskirts of Alcester.It was named in 
 the old Domesday record and is worthy 
 of note now. It contains{Arrow Mill,} 
 already noted in our text.            
  {  The Toll House.}This stands on the
 corner of the Worcester turn. Until   
 1860 gates barred the road, left, to  
 Evesham, and right, to Worcester. This
 house is still standing but is now a  
 private residence.                    
     {The Elephant Tree.}On the right  
 hand side coming out of Alcester,     
 approaching Arrow Toll House is the   
 locally well known elephant tree.It is
 a very old oak tree and its base and  
 roots have taken the shape of an      
 elephant.The bark looks every bit like
 an elephant hide.The age is unknown   
 but a local man aged 72 years old says
 it has always been there.
