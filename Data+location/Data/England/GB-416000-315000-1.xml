		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW</title>
		<content> This area is not a naturally unified  
one.  It comprises part of BARTON UNDER
NEEDWOOD, the whole of WYCHNOR and part
of ALREWAS.  A major obstacle to move- 
ment across the area is the barrier    
formed by the main railway line, A38   
road and Trent &amp; Mersey Canal. These   
run parallel and in close proximity to 
each other.  There are large areas of  
farm land. The villages are now large- 
ly dormitories for workers in local    
towns. There is one large historic     
house and park, and many other smaller 
old houses.  There is some modern      
building. There are three churches,    
three pubs and two restaurants. There  
are two motels. The gravel pits are    
the most noticeable industry but there 
are many other small businesses. Two   
old school buildings are now used for  
other purposes. Wychnor is the site of 
of a medieval deserted village.        </content>
