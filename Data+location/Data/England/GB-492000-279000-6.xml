 The village shop is on the east of the
main road and is a small building. The 
owners name is Mrs Bland and her home  
is attached to the shop. It is small   
inside the shop. She sells newspapers, 
stamps, sweets, and some food. Most    
village people come into the shop.     
Sometimes American visitors come to the
shop when they visit the church.
