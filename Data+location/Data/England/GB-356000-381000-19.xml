		<title>19Daresbury school</title>
		<content> The school was founded by Richard     
 Ryder. He said that he would pay a    
 wage of Â£10 to any schoolmaster who   
 was willing. The school opened as a   
 boys school. They were taught         
 virtually no arithmetic and did not   
 have any textbooks so most work was   
 done by heart. Writing was done on    
 slates which could be wiped clean and 
 reused. A number of parishes joined   
 and by 1874 the school had grown to   
 take 110 boys and girls and 95        
 infants. The first headmaster         
 appointed was Mr.John Cooper in 1875  
 and the school was enlarged in 1877.  
 It was an all age school until 1944   
 when it became a primary school. Today
 there are 70 children attending. The  
 main building consists of five rooms. 
 There are outside toilets and lunches 
 are brought from Knutsford each day.  
 There are football and netball teams. </content>
