		<title>15A BIRSTALL PET SHOP</title>
		<content> Birstall pet shop is in Libra Parade, 
 opposite a line of shops which are    
 converted houses. One was the village 
 poor house.                           
    The shop sells guinea-pigs,        
 rabbits, budgerigars, hamsters,       
 finches and gerbils. A lot of the     
 animals are reared by local people.   
 The shop also sells tablets, medicine,
 cages, food and most other things your
 pet could need. You can also buy books
 about looking after pets and animals. 
    It is open nearly all week but it  
 is closed on Wednesday afternoon and  
 all day Sunday.                       
    The best selling bird is the budgie
 and the best selling animals are      
 gerbils and hamsters.                 
    The shop will not sell a pet to a  
 child unless they are certain that    
 they have the permission of their     
 parents.                              </content>
