		<title>02Tourism - Ha'Penny Park</title>
		<content>      Ha'Penny Park is a very popular  
 place.  Lots of people go there every 
 day.  There are lots of things to do. 
 There is a Castle of Fun, which you   
 can bounce on and also an Elephant    
 which you can climb into and bounce   
 inside.  There is the Shooting Gallery
 which you aim at the targets and they 
 move.  There are lots of Arcade Games 
 and a Secret Tunnel with obstacles    
 that you climb through and get over.  
 There are boats and cars that you     
 control and small cars and motorbikes 
 that you can drive.  There is a Play  
 Area with slides, a firemen's pole, a 
 ball pond, ladders and ropes.  It is  
 open every day during the summer and  
 it only cost a ha'penny to get in.    
 When the Government abolished the     
 half-penny, Mr. Young, the owner, was 
 allowed to mint his own Cornish       
 Ha'Penny, which looks like gold.      </content>
