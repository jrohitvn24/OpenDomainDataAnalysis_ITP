		<content>{WORCESTER SIXTH FORM COLLEGE,}        
 newly opened in 1984, has been        
 responsible for the compilation of    
 this material. The information was    
 collected by {14 and 15 year old      
 students who are the last intake of   
 the{former girls grammar school}on    
 this site. Sixth formers and staff    
 have helped with the visits, collation
 and recording of the text.            
 Some of us have{used a computer       
{extensively for the first time.       
 We also studied the life of this area,
 so near to our campus, for the first  
 time. Much was new to us although we  
 are familiar with Worcestershire.     
 There is a{timelessness}about life    
 styles here which contrastS with the  
 pace we see elsewhere and which we    
 enjoyed{glimpsing. - THANK YOU  to the
 many local people who helped form our 
 impressions of the area.              </content>
