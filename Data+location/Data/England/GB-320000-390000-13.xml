 This Saturday we have got some rubbish
 to get rid of at the tip in West Kirby
 and some bottles to take to the       
 bottle-bank where bottles are disposed
 of and collected for re-cycling.      
 Then we came back via Hoylake, where  
 we did some shopping.We needed some   
 sandpaper,compost and some plant pots 
 at the D.I.Y shop.When we got home my 
 youngest brother went to play in his  
 room and Mum and I re-planted some pot
 plants and herbs we had been growing  
 from seed on our kitchen window.Then I
 took my golden labrador dog for a     
 walk.                                 
 I helped Dad in the afternoon as he   
 was mending our side gates.The wood   
 had rotted and he was replacing it    
 and then painting it in creosote to   
 protect it from the weather.
