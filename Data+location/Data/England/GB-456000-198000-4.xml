		<title>04THE VILLAGE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>Built in 1874 (old school c1770), the  
school is central to life in the       
villages and has one teacher (Mrs.Liz. 
Richardson) for the 16 children who    
each follow an individual programme    
of learning.There is also a full time  
classroom /clerical assistant. The     
variety of school based activity       
involves many villagers:e.g. fund      
raising,extra teaching and joining in  
with school events. A local farmer     
entrusted us with the incubation of    
120 pheasant eggs and the children     
benefit from his detailed knowledge of 
nature. Their 'human biology' lessons  
are given by a local J.P. We enjoy     
regular visits to the Green,the        
woods,the Arboretum &amp; local farms. We  
also have close links with Peers       
School,a large comprehensive school in 
Littlemore and make good use of their  
excellent facilities and patronage.    </content>
