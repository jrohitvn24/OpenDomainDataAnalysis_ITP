		<title>11Recreation in S.E. Guildford</title>
		<content> Golf is a popular pastime in          
 Guildford. The club house at Merrow   
 was built in 1886 and the course was  
 designed by James Braid. Before the   
 wars the course covered the whole of  
 Merrow Downs. During wartime a prison 
 camp was built which meant that some  
 of the holes were moved. Lord Onslow  
 donated land to the club of which he  
 is President.                         
                                       
 Eleven people are needed to maintain  
 the course and the holes vary greatly 
 in length. The club is popular, with  
 600 members ranging from 12 to 70     
 years, although it is quite expensive.
                                       
 Other forms of recreation in the      
 area include tennis, badminton,       
 bridge, flower clubs, art classes,    
 dancing, Girl Guides, Boy Scouts and  
 riding.                               </content>
