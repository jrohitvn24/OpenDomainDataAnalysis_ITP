		<content> The area is part of the county of     
 Greater Manchester and comprises the  
 boroughs of Manchester and Trafford.  
 In Stretford is a Police HQ which is a
 county responsibility, and a Town     
 Hall. To the NE of Hough End playing  
 fields are the Police stables and     
 kennels, which are fairly new since   
 the former premises in Moss Side were 
 demolished through redevelopment.     
 There is a small local police station 
 in Chorlton. Stretford Police Station 
 is the major station in Trafford and  
 offers a wide range of protection     
 services for the public, e.g. traffic 
 control, accident and crime           
 prevention, with the current emphasis 
 on juvenile misuse of drugs.
