At this time of year (July) weather    
permitting they are haytiming.They rise
at 7.00am and check the stock then if  
it's a sunny day they are out in the   
fields.At this particular time of year 
they take the lambs to the auction.    
   Mrs Hughes enjoys being a farmer's  
wife and wouldn't like to be any       
thing else, because she doesn't get    
bored and she's always busy.The house  
is very important to a farm because    
it is the office, doctors and          
veterinary surgery. She helps alot at  
lambing time but she doesn't help as   
much on the farm as she used to.       
However she is still as busy as ever   
preparing  meals for her husband and   
helpers.She has a lovely view from her 
house and loves living there.
