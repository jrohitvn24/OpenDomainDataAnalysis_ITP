 Charles II stayed at Prior's Court    
 before the Battle of Worcester. There

 Lane,converted into 4 houses, and an  
 old manor house.                      
 The village consists of 2 pubs,a 300  
 yr old PO building,a butchery and a   
 bakery (both over 100 yrs),a garage,  
 and a General Store (1954) called     
 Pound Stores because of the ancient   
 animal pound which was nearby. The    
 Men's Club opened in 1908.The two     
 farms in the village are Nixon        
 Court Farm and Rodgman's Farm.        
 St. James' Anglican church was built  
 in 1887. There are still Benedictine  
 nuns at Stanbrook Abbey (see page 16).
