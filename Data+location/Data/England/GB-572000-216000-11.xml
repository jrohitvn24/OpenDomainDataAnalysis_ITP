		<title>11THE BUTCHER'S SHOP</title>
		<content> The butcher's shop is built next to an
 old black,thatched barn. They used to 
 slaughter the animals in the barn     
 themselves but now they buy their meat
 from Humphries in Braintree. There is 
 one butcher and three part-time       
 workers who start work at 8am and     
 finish at 5-30. They close for an hour
 from 1pm to 2pm and close all         
 afternoon on Monday. There are 2 chill
 rooms and 2 freezers where beef,pork  
 and lamb are kept.Eggs,some tinned    
 food and a small amount of frozen     
 vegetables are also sold. Breast of   
 lamb is the cheapest meat they sell at
 30 pence a pound and fillet steak is  
 the most expensive at Â£3.70 a pound.  
 Most of the customers call into the   
 shop to buy their meat,but some people
 ring in their orders to be collected  
 later. The butcher will also deliver  
 meat to customers at their houses.    </content>
