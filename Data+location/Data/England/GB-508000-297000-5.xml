		<title>05MOVING INTO LOCAL VILLAGES</title>
		<content>  Most people moved to Ailsworth       
 because of the pleasant countryside   
 and peaceful atmosphere and because it
 is close to the growing large city of 
 Peterborough.  Many people moved to   
 the area between five and fifteen     
 years ago when a new estate was built.
 This of course enlarged the growing   
 community.  Ailsworth remains one of  
 the more popular villages on the west 
 side of Peterborough.                 
  On the other hand Stibbington is a   
 much smaller village where most of the
 residents were born and will die.     
 Though located beside the A1 it is    
 less accessible from Peterborough than
 Ailsworth so it is less popular with  
 commuters.                            
  Sutton and Waternewton both contain  
 many long-established residents with a
 few new comers who have bought up     
 properties as they have become vacant.</content>
