		<title>12Longridge Estate</title>
		<content> Beautiful trees and rhodedendrons,and 
 the house faced South,looking out over
 Murton Crags.East and west Lodges were
 built at the ends of the long         
 driveways,with excellent stable accom-
 odation,and a good house for the      
 head-gardener.                        
    Sir Hubert Jerningham was Member of
 Parliament for the Borough of Berwick-
 upon -Tweed,and he was the last person
 to hold this post before the          
 constituency was enlarged to include  
 the country area around Berwick.      
  After the death of Lady Jerningham a 
 marble statue was erected in her      
 memory and placed in Bankhill,Berwick,
 where it stands today,one of the few  
 reminders of the Jerninghams.In 1920  
 the Longridge Estate was broken up and
 sold by auction in the Corn Exchange, 
 Berwick on Sept 20th.
