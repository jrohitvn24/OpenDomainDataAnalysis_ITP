		<title>12The St Leger Family,Firbeck</title>
		<content> About two hundred years ago a famous  
 family called the{St Legers}lived at  
{Park Hill in Firbeck.}They were a very
 rich family. All that is left of{Park 
{Hill}now is an old garden wall and a  
 part of a boiler house. {Mr St Leger }
 asked another man to have a race to   
 see whose horse was the fastest.They  
 rode it in an oval shaped field just  
 outside{Firbeck.}It was held in {1776 
 It is 550 yards at the narrowest and  
 760 yards at the widest.The           
 circumference is about 2000 yards or 9
 furlongs.This was the first ever      
{St. Leger} race.The St Leger  is now  
 run at {Doncaster.}
