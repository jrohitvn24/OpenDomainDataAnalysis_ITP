		<title>03The South Downs Way</title>
		<content>  The Southdowns Way,a wide downland   
 track,goes through the bottom left    
 hand corner of our squares. There are 
 a lot of other footpaths in our area  
 of the Downs.One from Lewes,which goes
 up to Blackcap,which is a high hill on
 the South Downs west of Lewes.There   
 are also a lot of other tracks and    
 footpaths going off the South Downs   
 Way,but rejoining it again later. The 
 proper South Downs Way in our area is 
 shaped like the figure seven.         
  The South Downs Way is 82 miles long 
 stretching from Eastbourne to a little
 village near Petersfield called       
 Buriton.Soon it is going to be        
 extended by 20 miles.                 
  There is an organisation in Lewes    
 called the Lewes Footpaths Group.They 
 walk 5 miles of the South Downs Way   
 every 3 or 4 weeks on Sunday mornings.
 Their job involves clearing footpaths </content>
