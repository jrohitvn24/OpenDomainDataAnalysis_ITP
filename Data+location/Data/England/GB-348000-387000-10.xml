		<content> Pex Hill Cross; This cross was erected
 to commemerate the death of Peg Pussey
 but it was destroyed in 1868 when the 
 reservoir was built. Peg Pusseys      
 ghost; About 300 years ago a farmers  
 daughter was murdered by a young man  
 from Cronton Hall. She was enticed to 
 the top of the hill and thrown down.  
 Her ghost haunts the place. The witch;
 Another legend descibes how she was   
 cast off by her lover and in her      
 despair went to see him at Cronton    
 Hall. The door was slammed in her face
 - she went mad and rambled about Pex  
 or 'Peg's' hill until she died. Hence 
 the origin of her being a witch.      
 Superstition; led the people who lived
 around the foot of Pex Hill to believe
 that it was haunted by a band of elves
 hence Pixies Hill. "Ne let the pouke  
 nor other evil sprites, Fray us with  
 things that be not".                  </content>
