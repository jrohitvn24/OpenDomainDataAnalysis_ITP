		<title>04NEWTON REIGNY CHURCH PENRITH</title>
		<content> Newton Reigny church celebrated 400   
 years with a flower festival which was
 an open-air event,with Morris Dancers 
 and Penrith Town band.The service was 
 well attended.The preacher was the    
 Reverend Christopher Lewis.All the    
 people that were baptised and married 
 there in the past, were invited.      
 Despite the weather,the event,one of  
 a number to celebrate a major         
 restoration of St.John church,was a   
 great success.The weather here can be 
 very hot in July, at times reaching   
 up to 20-25 C. After the hot weather  
 it rains but is still quite warm.There
 is very little pollution in this area 
 except for crop spraying.There are    
 a lot of good walks,and bicycle       
 rides. The hedgerows are full of      
 Wild Buttercups,Clover,Pink Campion,  
 Foxgloves,Lady's Slipper and Kesh.
