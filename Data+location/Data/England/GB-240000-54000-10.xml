		<content>    Our area offers many different     
 kinds of habitat and is a haven for   
 birds on migration.Many waders breed  
 in Siberia and return to us in the    
 winter.Others breed here and go south 
 for the winter.In most years there are
 even some American birds blown off    
 course over the Atlantic in the gales,
 such as the Spoonbill which has       
 wintered at Whacker for several years 
 running.                              
    Some insects also cross the        
  Atlantic . The American Monarch      
 butterfly is seen here in Autumn, and 
 the first Red Admiral has flown across
 the channel from France.The anceint   
 Oakwood of our area are very important
 as one Oak tree can support as many as
 120 different kind of insects.        
    There are many varieties of plants 
 growing here some of them are very    
 rare and only found in this country.  </content>
