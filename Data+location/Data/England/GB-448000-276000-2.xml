		<content> The G.E.C is a very large company, it 
 does all different kinds of things.   
 One of the main qualities are         
 computers, they have five different   
 computers. They buy computers and make
 them bigger. They have three of their 
 own computers. One is for jobs, the   
 second is for telling them if one goes
 wrong and the third one is spare. They
 have a computer system which you can  
 phone a message into and it goes on a 
 disc. The computers go to steel works 
 and they also go abroad. There are    
 about 600 people working in the G.E.C,
 it all depends on the amount of       
 workmen off sick.                     
 They have a little computer which is  
 very powerful and slower.
