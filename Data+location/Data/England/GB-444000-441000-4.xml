		<title>04The Ark Museum</title>
		<content> The building which houses the{local   
{history}collection of brewing tools   
 and folk material was converted by    
 John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery, the   
 first part in 1960-1 and the second   
 part in 1966-7, the whole being opened
 as a{museum}in September 1967 from    
 when it has become a centre for{      
{tourism.}The building was erected in  
 the late fifteenth century and in the 
 sixteenth century, a two story bay was
 added to the front. It was one of two 
 houses licensed as a meeting house in 
 the town. In the eighteenth century,  
 th building was divided into two. The 
 solar end became a cottage and a shop 
 which it remained until 1959 and the  
 rest was the old Falcon Inn. Recently 
 there has been much debate about the  
 Museum's survival and contrasting{    
{attitudes} have been shown.
