		<title>12A COCKFIELD CHILD'S DAY 2</title>
		<content>Lunch time play depends on when we     
finish our lunch.After lunch time play 
we have topic work;sometimes this is   
History,sometimes Geography and        
sometimes Science or Nature Study.The  
last lesson of the afternoon for the   
5th years in winter time is woodwork.I 
made a ship and a car in wood this     
year.In the summer term the 5th years  
have gardening and I share a plot with 
Christina Warren and we grow flowers   
and vegetables.My friends Simon and    
Alistair belong to a gang as well as   
several others. I come home for tea    
between 6 p.m.and 7 p.m..After tea I   
go out until about 8.30 p.m.to play    
a game called "Spies".Then I come      
home and go to bed at 9.45 p.m.
