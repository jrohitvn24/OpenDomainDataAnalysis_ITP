     {Bentley}is the smallest village  
 in the area.  There are only four old 
 houses and a Public House called the  
{'Horse and Jockey'.                   
                                       
      The former Parish Church of St   
 John was built in 1837 and demolished 
 in 1971.  Only the Churchyard now     
 remains.                              
                                       
      There is also a farm called      
{'Chapel Farm'}which is named after an 
 earlier Chapel dedicated to the Holy  
 Trinity.  A few remains of this Chapel
 can still be seen.
