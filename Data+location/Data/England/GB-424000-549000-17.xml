		<title>17FROM CHAPEL TO WORKSHOP</title>
		<content> On the road to Chester Moor there is a
 chapel which is being used as a work  
 shop.The Wesleyan chapel is 102 years 
 old.There are 19 people working in it 
 and 16 are employees.They build houses
 and extensions and are  presenly      
 extending the x-ray department of the 
 local hospital.The workforce's day is 
 from 7:45 to 4:30.The owner says that 
 he would like to expand,but regrets   
 that he can't due to expense and feels
 that his business will remain as it is
 now.The biggest order at the present  
 is for windows and doors.Everyone     
 appears to enjoy their work in this   
 quiet corner of Chester-le-Street.
