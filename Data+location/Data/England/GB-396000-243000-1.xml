 This is a rural area, situated in the 
 heart of the{Vale of Evesham.}The     
{Evesham-Pershore}road crosses the     
 block and the{River Avon}runs through 
 the village of Cropthorne. The main   
 features are{Farming and Market       
{Gardening}so most of the land is      
 covered by fields. Three, small,      
 pretty villages{Cropthorne,Little     
{Comberton and Wick}occupy some of the 
 area. There is a church in each       
 village but only Cropthorne has a     
 school. Another characteristic is the 
 large number of{Black and White       
{Cottages}and several large, old houses
 of various periods. Most of them with 
 beautiful gardens.
