		<title>09Dairy Farms</title>
		<content> All the farms in our area are Dairy   
 farms.Daily routines vary but         
 generally the farmer would start by   
 milking his cows.Morning milking times
 tend to be between 6.30 to 8.45am.The 
 farmer will milk his cows again from  
 about 4.30 to 6.45pm.Some farmers have
 different milking parlours.The farmer 
 usually milks Freisian cows.One common
 parlour is the Herringbone.There is   
 also an Abreast parlour.The Milk      
 Marketing Board collects the milk in  
 large blue tankers and it is taken    
 to Davidstowe where it is made into   
 cheese.In the old days milk churns    
 were used and many collection points  
 can still be seen at Kestle and       
 Underlane and can be seen at other    
 places.Another breed of cow is the    
 Guernsey cow and its milk goes to     
 Ambrosia where it is made into custard
 and cream.                            </content>
