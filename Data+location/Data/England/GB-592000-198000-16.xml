		<content> On{Wednesday 19th June}we had our     
 sports day . All the class took part.I
 went in for the flat race and the     
{three legged race}with Claire Morris. 
 We did not expect to win because when 
 we were practising we kept tripping   
 up.After the{three legged}was the     
{skipping race.}Susan Palmer came first
 and I came second.Then we had a long  
 wait because the girls{long distance  
 race was number fifty two.While I was 
 waiting I went and got a lolly.Then it
 was time to go to the start and line  
 up.We had to run round the track one  
 and a half times. The team points were
 added up and Red had won.They did a   
 lap of honour carrying the trophy.We  
 just had time to put the chairs away  
 before the thunder started.
