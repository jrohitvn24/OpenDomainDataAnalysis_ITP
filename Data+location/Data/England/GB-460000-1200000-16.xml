		<title>16Housing in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> In Uyeasound you can find lots of     
 croft houses.Some almost as they were 
 built,some have been changed,new rooms
 have been built on,everything has been
 modernised.There are also derelict    
 crofthouses which were abandoned      
 because the land was taken over for   
 sheep so the people who lived on the  
 crofts had to move away for other     
 jobs.                                 
   The other houses are the new ones   
 which have been built.There are also  
 old ones,sometimes cold and creaky,   
 sometimes warm and cosy.Council       
 houses have built,lots of them        
 together,each with three bedroom      
 There are also small ones for old     
 people.                               
   My favourite house is my house.It is
 new,it has lots of rooms and is fine  
 and warm in Winter.
