		<title>11LIFE IN LEASOWE  (PAGE 1)</title>
		<content> A group of mothers from the estate    
 held a forum with our class to discuss
 life on the Leasowe Estate.Here are   
 some extracts from the discussion.    
{How good do you consider the shopping 
{facilities to be?                     
 There has been an improvement since   
 the new shopping block was built,but  
 there is a real need for a chemist,as 
 the nearest one is about 3 miles away.
 There is also need for a launderette. 
{Do you enjoy living in Leasowe?       
 Yes,we find that people are friendly  
 and look after each other.The estate  
 has improved greatly over the last few
 years.There is less rubbish thrown    
 about and less vandalism(although it's
 still bad).The council are too slow in
 completing repairs,and unemployment is
 high,but that's true in many places.
