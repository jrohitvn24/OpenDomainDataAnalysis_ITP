{       ****  INSECTS  **** }          
  "I saw beautiful{dragonflies}over the
 river. They were blue and silvery with
 delicate wings. They played chase in  
 and out of the riverbank plants."     
  "I caught 12{grasshoppers}. Their    
 bodies are green with a black line    
 along the back. Their back legs are   
 brown and sit up like a triangle."    
  "The{Meadow Brown butterfly}has a    
 brown body. The wings are brown and   
 orange and semi-circular. There are   
 dots on the wings like eyes. It looked
 furry and fluttered about on flowers."
{       ****  FLOWERS  ****            
  "The best flowers I saw were orange  
 and yellow, called{Birdsfoot trefoil} 
 or 'bacon and eggs' as we call them. I
 like the shapes of the flower head. It
 reminds me of a bursting sun."        </content>
