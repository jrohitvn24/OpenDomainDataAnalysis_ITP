		<content> Our school has got a community and    
 school newspaper.The paper is called  
{THE RAUNDS CAROUSEL.}The newspaper is 
 run by {MR STRATRFORD}who is a member 
 of our school staff.The paper is      
 posted to every house in{HARGRAVE,    
{STANWICK,RINGSTEAD }and{RAUNDS}by     
 volentary pupils of our school.{MR    
{STRATFORD} collects his information   
 by appealing to pupils to write about 
 events or anything of importance.The  
 public in the area are also asked so  
 are local clubs.Once {MR STRATFORD}   
 receives the information he picks out 
 of it what he considers to be suitable
 for the next issue.Advertising space  
 is also sold in the paper.This money  
 pays for roughly half of the paper,the
 rest is collected by contributions.   
 We conducted a survey and discovered  
 that the most popular local newspaper 
 was the {EVENING TELEGRAPH.}          </content>
