		<title>02Wistow Hall near Kilby</title>
		<content> Wistow Hall once belonged to the      
 Halford family but has now been       
 converted into flats for rent. Other  
 parts have been developed into a      
 garden and aquatic centre. At the time
 of the Battle of Naseby 14th July 1645
 King Charles I and Prince Rupert      
 called here while retreating from     
 Naseby to Leicester. While there they 
 exchanged saddles which are still     
 beautifully preserved. The Hall stands
 in an 18th Centuary park with a small 
 lake. Other parts of the holding have 
 been turned into Wistow Park now      
 partly a public open space. Although  
 parking is limited and animals still  
 graze on the site it is well used as a
 place of public recreation.
