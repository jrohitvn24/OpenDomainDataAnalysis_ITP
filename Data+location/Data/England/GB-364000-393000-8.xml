		<title>08Farming around Culcheth</title>
		<content>    Rowe Farm near to Culcheth is a    
 farm which is typical of this area.   
 The animals which are kept there are  
 ponies, cows, bulls, dogs, turkeys,   
 chickens and ducks.                   
    The cows, turkeys and chickens are 
 kept for meat and the dogs are kept as
 pets. The ducks are kept for the eggs.
 The crops which they grow are barley  
 and hay. They grow these crops because
 the hay is needed for the ponies and  
 the barley is for the cattle.         
    One of the main jobs on the farm is
 beef cattle, although there are other 
 jobs carried out. These jobs are      
 mucking out the farm, field work and  
 feeding the animals.                  
    Tractors, trailers, mowing         
 machines, bailers, combine harvesters,
 corn drills and cattle wagons are all 
 used on the farm.
