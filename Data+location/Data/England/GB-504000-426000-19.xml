		<title>19WEST HULL BIRDS EYE FACTORY</title>
		<content>  THE BIRDS EYE WALL'S FACTORY IS OWNED
 BY UNILEVER. THIS PLANT WAS BUILT IN  
 1967 AND SPECIALISES IN FISH PRODUCTS,
 PEAS, SPROUT AND ROOT CROP PROCESSING.
  MOST FISH NOW-DAYS IS IMPORTED IN    
 FROZEN BLOCKS FROM ICELAND AND NORWAY,
 WHILST THE VEGETABLES ARE GROWN       
 LOCALLY.                              
  THE FACTORY EMPLOYS 800 PEOPLE; ABOUT
 HALF ARE WOMEN WORKING PART-TIME      
 SHIFTS ROUND THE CLOCK. THEY ARE      
 PICKED UP BY SPECIAL BUSES EACH DAY.  
  THE PRODUCTS ARE PROCESSED, AND      
 FROZEN AND APPEAR IN THE FAMILIAR     
 PACKS IN OUR SHOPS.                   
  PEA PRODUCTION SEEMS DELICATE. THEY  
 ARE AT THEIR BEST FOR ONLY A FEW HOURS
 SO WHAT EVER TIME OF DAY, FARMERS RACE
 TO HARVEST THEM, AND LORRIES HURRY TO 
 THE FACTORY FOR PROCESSING            
                                       
                                       </content>
