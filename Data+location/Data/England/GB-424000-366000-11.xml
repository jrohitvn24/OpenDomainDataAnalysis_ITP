		<content>     ROWSLEY WELL-DRESSING             
           In our block there is part  
 of a village called Rowsley.Every year
 Rowsley has a festival about the same 
 time as every other village in        
 Derbyshire.That is because of the     
 Derbyshire well dressing              
 Festival.Every village in Derbyshire  
 makes a well dressing made of clay and
 paper.The first thing that happens in 
 the Festival is the procession for    
 the fancy dress.This year there was a 
 Festival Princess for the first time  
 ever.After the procession came the    
 fancy dress.On the field where the    
 fancy dress took place there were     
 some stalls with food and other       
 objects on them.The next day started  
 of with the well dressing.As soon as  
 that had finished our school displayed
 some maypole and country dancing.Allso
 on the rec there were sports .        </content>
