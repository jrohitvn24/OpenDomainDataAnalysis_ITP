		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO HARPUR HILL</title>
		<content>{                                      
 Our area is directly to the south of  
 the town of Buxton on the edge of the 
 Peak District National Park.          
                                       
 The white cliffs of the limestone     
 quarries in the south east and north  
 west and north west can be seen       
 for miles. The other landmark is {    
{Solomon's Temple,}a folly on one of   
 the area's grassy hills. The main     
 residential area -{Harpur Hill}-      
 takes its name from one of them.      
 In the 19th century Harpur Hill was a 
 separate village but now a continuous 
 line of houses link it to Buxton. It  
 is an important part of the town;     
 there are industrial estates, quarries
 and a Further Education College.      
 However, most of the area is high,    
 rough pasture land with few buildings.
