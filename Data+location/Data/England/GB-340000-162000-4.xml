		<title>04The Village Of Hewish</title>
		<content> Hewish is a village on the main A 370 
 road from Bristol to                  
 Weston-super-Mare. In the square we   
 studied there are ten residential     
 houses, two working farms, one filling
 station, one guest house, one car body
 repair shop and one garden centre.    
 Many vehicles use the main road and we
 have made a count of them during      
 school time. Many trains use the main 
 line from Bristol to the West Country.
 Last month (June 1985) a steam train  
 passed our school to celebrate 150    
 years of the Great Western Railway.   
 Hewish is mainly a farming community  
 with the land being used to raise     
 sheep and cattle.
