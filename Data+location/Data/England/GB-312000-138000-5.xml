		<content>     The Manor is a{unique residential 
{Folk Centre.}It was bought in 1965 by 
 the{Halsway Manor Society. }          
    Today folk enthusiasts from all    
 over the country enjoy the music  and 
 hospitality.  Every Friday people     
 arrive and have a meal in the Long    
 Room and then enjoy the evening       
 dancing sessions. The folk weekends   
 are varied, sometimes of song and     
 dance, sometimes with Morris Men with 
 dances old and new, and at other      
 times there are Scottish dance clubs. 
 On occasion there is even sword and   
 clog dancing !                        
    Musicians, landscape painters and  
 ramblers are not forgotten and are    
 welcomed here.                        
    To help pay for the Folk Centre,   
 the manor is used during the week by  
 local firms and businesses when they  
 run residential courses.              </content>
