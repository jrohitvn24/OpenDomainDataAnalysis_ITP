		<title>03Farming in Knockholt</title>
		<content> Much of the land is owned by the      
 Chevening Estate, which is rented out 
 to three farmers, one of them having  
 three farms as one unit. Three other  
 farms cover most of the remaining farm
 land.  There are both pastoral and    
 arable farming with a little more of  
 the latter, which has increased in the
 last ten years. Oats, wheat, barley,  
 oilseed rape, peas, beans, lucerne and
 maize are all grown for both human and
 animal consumption. Spring beans are  
 sometimes sent to Germany where they  
 are ground and mixed with the flour.  
 The l985 harvest was very difficult   
 due to the wet spring and summer and  
 some of the crops planned for human   
 use had to be sold for animal feed.   
 Straw is baled for bedding, in large, 
 round or square bales or small bales  
 for private horse owners. Silage and  
 hay are made.                         </content>
