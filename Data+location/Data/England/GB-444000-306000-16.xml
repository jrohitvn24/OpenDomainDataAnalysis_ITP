		<title>16Bagworth Churches</title>
		<content> There are three churches in our area  
 St.Peter's Thornton, Holy Rood        
 Bagworth and Cross Hills Chapel in the
 valley between the two villages.      
 St.Peter's Church, Thornton has       
 approx. 50 people attending Sunday    
 services. There are also 4 junior     
 clubs and 2 adult groups. This is an  
 active church, having an important    
 role in village life.                 
 St.Peter's Church dates back to Norman
 times,it stands on an imposing site   
 above the Reservoir and surrounded by 
 towering beech trees.The spire        
 dominates the views around Thornton   
 and is well worth a visit.            
 Holy Rood church in Bagworth was      
 demolished in 1968 due to coalmining  
 subsidence.It was re-built in a       
 'modern' concrete style and           
 unfortunately only has an average     
 congregation of 15.                   </content>
