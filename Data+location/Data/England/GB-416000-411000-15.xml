		<title>15OUR COMMUNITY CONSTABLE</title>
		<content> In our area we have a community       
 constable called P.C.Allen. If he is  
 working on the 8am to 4pm shift he    
 gets up at 6.30am. When he gets to the
 police station he checks to see if    
 anything has happened in the night.   
 Then he sets out on his own and walks 
 round his beat. He likes his beat     
 because it has shops and schools and  
 pubs and businesses as well as country
 side. There is not much violence and  
 he likes the people. He talks to      
 people and tries to find things out.  
 He does not carry a gun but he has    
 used his truncheon if someone is      
 violent. He is not allowed to hit     
 anyone on the head. The worst part of 
 his job is going to accidents and     
 having to tell people that someone has
 been in an accident. The best part of 
 his job is that every day is different
