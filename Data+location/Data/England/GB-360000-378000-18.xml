		<title>18Ponds and Pits in Whitley</title>
		<content> The pond to the East of Morris Hill   
 was used for sand extraction. It is   
 water-filled now and used for fishing 
 and occasional swimming. The banks are
 covered by grass and bushes and small 
 sandy areas.The trees are mostly pussy
 willow about l0-l5 feet tall, with    
 small oak trees on the water's edge in
 dry areas,overgrown with moss.There is
 silver birch,broom,gorse,rhododendrum,
 foxgloves and bramble.  The pond is   
 surrounded by a sandy path with syca- 
 mores on either side. The Townpit pond
 was possibly a marl pit, but unusually
 it has stone sides.Forty or more years
 ago farm horses used to drink from the
 pit, also they used to use it to wash 
 potatoes.   The pond in Dark Lane,    
 opposite Maple Cottage, used to have  
 fresh-water mussels in it, but they   
 died when they were transferred to    
 Townpit Pond, where ducks now live.   </content>
