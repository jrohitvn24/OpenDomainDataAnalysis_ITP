		<title>03FAMILY LIFE NEAR BROSELEY</title>
		<content> My name is{Megan Farr.}I live on a    
 farm with my mum and dad and my little
 sister and brother. On{Saturday}      
 morning my sister and I go to{ballet  
 in{Dawley.}My dad usually takes me.   
 I stay at ballet for about four hours.
 Mum and dad go{shopping}in            
{Bridgnorth.}When we get home we go to 
 my grandparents or  we play at home.  
 Every night I have to feed the ducks  
 and hens.Sometimes I feed Jack our    
 dog.                                  
 On{Sunday}I stay in bed reading. We   
 don't usually do much unless we go to 
 grandad's again. I just play or read  
 or help my mum in the garden. My Dad  
 might help my mum in the garden or go 
 to get wood or work on the car. We    
 don't usually have a special Sunday   
 lunch, but a lot of families do. Some 
 people go to church but we don't.
