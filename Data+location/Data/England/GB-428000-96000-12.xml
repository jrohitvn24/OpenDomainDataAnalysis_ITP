		<title>12Gordleton Farm-Blacksmith</title>
		<content>  The blacksmith's forge is an out     
 building of the orignal Gordleton Farm
 in Silver Street. There is a{farrier,}
 a{general smith}and an apprentice.    
 Traditionally apprenticeships lasted 8
 years and cost the apprentice a penny 
 per week.                             
  The{farrier}makes horse shoes and    
 travels the area to shoe about 6horses
 a day. The{general smith}specialises  
 in wrought iron work,making ornamental
 pieces for sale in his New Milton     
 shop, and restoration work.           
  The{forge}burns coke instead of coal 
 and an electric fan has replaced the  
 bellows. Electric welders are used    
 for intricate wrought iron work but   
 they prefer to maintain traditional   
 methods where possible. Both smiths   
 take part in the New Forest Show and  
 are keen to revive the festival of St 
 Clem's-November 23rd.                 </content>
