		<content> I see the slow elegant turning of the 
 Mill sails above the roof tops on my  
 way to and from school.  The flood    
 lighting of the Mill makes it a       
 striking feature of the City's skyline
 at night.  This Windmill is unique in 
 being a working windmill in the heart 
 of an ancient city.  It is just ten   
 minutes walk from the Cathedral.  This
 four sail mill is the last survivor of
 nine mills which once stood along Mill
 (formerly Mills) Road, high on the    
 Lincoln Edge overlooking the Trent    
 Valley.  Built about 1798, it was     
 taken over by the Ellis family in 1892
 and worked until 1950's using only two
 sails latterly.  By the early 1970's  
 it was in an extremely derelict       
 condition and a fire destroyed what   
 remained of the internal fittings.
