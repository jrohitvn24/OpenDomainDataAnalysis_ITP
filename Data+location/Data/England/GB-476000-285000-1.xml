 the fertile Welland Valley.   Most of 
 the farmland is owned by London       
 merchant/bankers and rented out.      
 Fourfamilies own and farm the         
 remainder.   Some local inhabitants   
 work on the farms; others are employed
 at Dingley Hall, an Elizabethan House 
 divided into flats.   Several work in 
 nearby towns and one or two commute to
 London, returning at weekends only.

 feeling of community.   There area
