		<content>   Last year our Junior School was     
 extended and altered so that the local
 people could use it in the evenings,  
 during the holidays and also, in      
 certain rooms, during the day.        
   The Community College as it is      
 called has added to many people's     
 lives. As well as the recreational    
 facilities that have now been made    
 available a bar has been built in what
 was once the teachers' staffroom.     
   Sports now available include five-a 
 side, pool, uni-hoc, table tennis,    
 bowls, darts, squash, badminton,      
 taekwando and women's keep fit.       
   Clubs and organisations also use the
 premises. The elderly can use the     
 community rooms to play bingo. Once   
 a week the Luncheon Club is held when 
 the 'meals on wheels' are delivered to
 the college and the old people can    
 enjoy their dinners in company.       </content>
