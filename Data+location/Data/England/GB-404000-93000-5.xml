		<content>    When I am standing on the step of  
 my house I see about six bungalows and
 a number of houses. My house is made  
 of brick and the roof has got slates  
 on it which are a greeny colour and   
 the bricks are brown. The paintwork of
 the outside of my house is a mustard  
 colour. I have got three windows at   
 the front of my house and they are    
 double glazed. In the front of the    
 house we have got some grass and soil 
 at the end with flowers, then right at
 the front there is a four foot brick  
 wall which is a grey colour.          
    My road is a dead end; it goes     
 round at the top and is straight at   
 the sides. It is a tarmac road.       
 Altogether there are about forty four 
 houses ad bungalows.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
