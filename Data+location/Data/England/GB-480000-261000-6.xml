also the Post Office. It was the last  
shop of the Earls Barton Cooperative   
Society it has now been sold to a      
private owner. At Bellinge there are 3 
shops. Bunces is a mini super-market,  
there is a Chinese take-away and a     
newsagents. We went into Bunces shop.  
We looked at the things for sale. We   
could buy milk, toys, sweets, ice      
cream, wrapping paper, books, drinks,  
wool, cards, newspapers and stamps.    
We could not buy pets, petrol and      
garden things. There is only one shop  
in Great Billing. That is the Post     
Office and general stores.There is a   
mobile shop called the  Coop.It is     
a food van. The Post Office sells      
lots of things such as sweets, bread   
and toys.
