		<content>,is mentioned in records dating back   
to 1293 .                              
 There are plans to flood the Broad Oak
valley and build a reservoir. People   
are generally in favour, but the       
beautiful valley may be lost.Meanwhile 
the few old houses and farms remain    
boarded up. Facilities in Broad Oak    
are just about adequate for the local  
inhabitants, although there is one     
popular complaint about not having a   
bank.The facilities consist of :1      
post office and general store, 1 hair  
dressers,2  public houses, 1  village  
hall,1 farm shop,2 farms  offering     
"Pick Your Own"facilities, Countess of 
Huntingdon's,Connextion, &amp; Chapel      
(Congregational).There is talk of      
a by-pass which has several suggested  
routes -but not many  want it to go    
past where they live.If the by-pass is 
built many farmers will lose good land.</content>
