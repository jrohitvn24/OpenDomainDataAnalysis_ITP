		<title>06TOWN PLANNING IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> There are 2 different councils in this
 area,West Sussex County Council and   
 Chichester District Council.They have 
 problems caused by old buildings,     
 beautiful countryside and old country 
 roads.These are narrow and twisty so  
 large vehicles cannot use them without
 causing damage.There are no large     
 factories here because the smoke and  
 appearance would ruin the atmosphere  
 and look of the area.There are also no
 by-passes round Midhurst in spite of  
 the traffic congestion because the    
 countryside would have to be          
 destroyed.Housing is also a problem as
 no high-rise buildings are allowed    
 above 3 storeys.When a house is built 
 it must be in a style that blends with
 existing houses.This can be seen in a 
 development called Little Midhurst.   
 Here the houses are built in the style
 of earlier centuries.                 </content>
