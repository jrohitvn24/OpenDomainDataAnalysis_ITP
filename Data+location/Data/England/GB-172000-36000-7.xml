		<title>07Recreation in Stithians.</title>
		<content> Stithians has not got many amusements 
 so people go off to different         
 places. We have board games like      
 Chess, Cludo and snakes and           
 ladders. We have outdoor games like   
 tap tap and in, tig and British       
 bulldog. Some boys play cricket and   
 football. Some people get bored with  
 these games and go to the leisure     
 centre to do sports and swimming. The 
 adults go to bingo, bowls, tennis     
 club, snooker/billiards and choirs.   
 Some parents go to different meetings 
 and parties. The teenagers go to      
 discos in and out of the village.     
 People go to the Seven Stars for a    
 drink. The reservoir is very popular  
 for water sports like windsurfing,    
 sailing and waterskiing. You need a   
 licence to fish.
