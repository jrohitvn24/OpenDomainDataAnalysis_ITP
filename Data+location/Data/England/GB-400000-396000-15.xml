		<title>15HOUSING IN HADFIELD 2</title>
		<content> As you walk through Hadfield you      
 notice that some of the old terraced  
 houses were built of sandstone. You   
 can tell they were old houses because 
 the houses were black and dirty. This 
 was because of the smoke from the     
 mills that used to be there. Some     
 people have had their old houses      
 sandblasted so they look new not old. 
   Before 1845 houses had slabs of     
 stone for the roof but in 1845 people 
 built a railway which came from       
 Manchester to Sheffield to Lincoln so 
 when they had that they could bring   
 slates on the railway for the roofs.  
 The slates came from North Wales.Slate
 was better than stone as it was much  
 lighter.                              
   In the centre of the area is Mersey 
 Bank House a large detached house     
 built of sandstone with a slate roof. 
 It is now an old people's home.       </content>
