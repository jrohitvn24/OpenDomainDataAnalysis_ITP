		<title>18WHEN I LEAVE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> When I leave Stockton Hall School I   
 intend to become a long distance lorry
 driver,and drive through the night,and
 sleep in the day-time.I shall not be  
 able to drive at the age of sixteen   
 but I shall go as a driver's mate and 
 help him unload the cargo.            
         I shall have to learn to drive
 and have my sight tested if I want to 
 be a driver myself some day.Sight is  
 very important if you want to do a lot
 of night driving.                     
         I'm not going to get married  
 unless I'm tempted and if I do then I 
 shall have one child and hope it's a  
 boy.I shall go to the Pub but only for
 a couple of pints unless it's         
 Christmas.I'm not going to smoke      
 because it is too expensive and anyway
 it damages your health.In my spare    
 time I'll make model boats or         
 aeroplanes.                           </content>
