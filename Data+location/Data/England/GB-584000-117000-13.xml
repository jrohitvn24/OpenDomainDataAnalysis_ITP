		<content> Until twenty years ago the were two   
 shops in the village.  Then, until    
 seven years ago, there was one.  Then 
 there was not one at all, but quite   
 recently the local pub _ the King's   
 Head _ has made a small shop in its   
 lobby.  Many families make a weekly   
 shopping trip to the big supermarkets 
 in Hastings.  If the own a freezer    
 cabinet, and many do, this one trip   
 may be enough.  The nearest shops,    
 banks and post office are at Rye,     
 three miles away, and this is the     
 usual shopping centre.  The market in 
 Rye on Thursdays is also popular.     
 Most people go there by car; a few use
 the buses.  The milkman delivers daily
 or on alternate days.  He also brings 
 soft drinks, bread and potatoes.  A   
 'mobile shop' comes once a week. The  
 ice_cream van comes twice.  Three     
 people sell produce at their gates.   </content>
