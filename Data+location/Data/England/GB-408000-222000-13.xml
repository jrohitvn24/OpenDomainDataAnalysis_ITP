		<content>    The Headquarters of the            
 International Centre for Conservation 
 Education is in the village of Guiting
 Power.They help to save animals from  
 extinction. They make tapes and slides
 to teach people not to kill animals.  
 Tapes are made in different languages 
 especially French,which is widely     
 spoken in Africa. African conservation
 workers then translate the scripts    
 into the local language.              
    The Centre equips vans with audio- 
 visual equipment.The vans go to remote
 villages overseas to teach            
 conservation.                         
    The Centre runs courses for        
 overseas workers. A Kenyan once came  
 to school to tell us about his        
 country.                              
    We like to borrow their brass-     
 rubbings of endangered species.
