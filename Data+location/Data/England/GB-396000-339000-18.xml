The church, dedicated to St.Margaret of
Antioch, Draycott-le-Moor stands on a  
small hill above an old Roman Road, now
A50. It shares a 'Rector, the          
Revd.A.Wheeler with the neighbouring   
parish of Forsbrook.                   
                                       
The church has its own Sunday services 
but the congregations join regularly   
with each other. In the past two years 
the Sunday School has been restarted.  
                                       
The tower has a fine peal of bells and 
many groups of bellringers visit. There
is a church magazine published each    
month which gives details of services, 
who's who in the church and reports on 
the work of the parish.                
                                       
It is a large parish but with a small  
church population.                     </content>
