 An Ordinary Day in my Life by Mary    
                                       
 At 7.30 I wake up to the sound of my  
 bedroom door opening. I am vaguely    
 aware of my Mum coming in and turning 
 the radio on. She sees I am awake and 
 says "Hi". I grunt to her and settle  
 down on my pillow to listen to a      
 competition called Password.          
 That over, I lay in bed a couple of   
 minutes and then get up and get       
 dressed. I talk to the budgies and    
 then go downstairs for my breakfast;  
 Shreddies and milk. My Dad departs at 
 8.20 and cycles to his job at Drax    
 Power Station. I leave for school at  
 8.50. I work until 12.00 and then come
 home for dinner. I return to school at
 !.00 and work until 3.45. At home I   
 read until 6.00 when I have tea. I    
 wash up then mend my clock until bed. </content>
