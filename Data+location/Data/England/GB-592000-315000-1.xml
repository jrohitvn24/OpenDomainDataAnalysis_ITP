		<content> This is a rural area of slightly      
 undulating country with several small 
 old-established, mostly deciduous     
 woods.   The land is mainly used for  
 arable farming, but with expanding    
 gravel working in the north-west.     
 Population is small and largely       
 concentrated in longham village.      
 After years of decline the population 
 is growing slowly as people move in   
 from other regions.   Bittering       
 village comrises 4 inhabited and one  
 empty house, a medieval church, the   
 archaelogical site of the medieval    
 village (Bitteringa) &amp; the site of the
 recently demolished Bittering Hall,   
 once the home of William Wilberforce, 
 the anti-slavery campaigner.   Longham
 boasts a public house, village        
 store/post office, &amp; a social club.   
 Most of the working population are    
 employed outside the area.   Fox      </content>
