		<content> Living at Stourmouth is attended by   
{certain drawbacks}that might seem     
 strange to town dwellers. There is no 
 main drainage, so that every house has
 to have a{cesspit.}This is due to the 
 village being almost at Sea-Level. No 
{piped gas,}and problems with water    
 supply so that you have to count      
 baths.{Bus services}are more or less  
 non-existent. There is a school bus   
 going to Canterbury at 7.45 am with   
 return trips at 4.45 and 5.45 pm. Just
 taking her cat to the vet in Ash costs
 one old lady Â£9.00 in taxi fares. Some
 friction between villagers and Farmers
 is caused by mud being brought onto   
 the roads by tractors. Kids cannot use
 bikes and cars skid, but farmers do   
 not seem to care and will not wash    
 tractors down.
