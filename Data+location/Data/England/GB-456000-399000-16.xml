		<title>16CHANGING FASHIONS IN BALBY</title>
		<content> I am a 9 year old pupil at Woodfield  
 First School. When Mrs. Shorthose aged
 69 visited the school I asked her if  
 fashions had changed very much since  
 she was young. She laughed and said,  
 "fashions come and go sometimes in a  
 full circle. The simple 'T' shirts you
 wear were called chemises in my day." 
 She said that the greatest difference 
 was in the materials. She wore only   
 natural fibres: wool, cotton or linen.
 She had a best silk dress.            
   She said that washday was a real    
 headache in her youth: no washing     
 machine, no drier, no washing powders,
 just elbow grease and soap. Modern    
 materials make cleanliness so much    
 easier. She also said that she wore   
 soft leather boots buttoned at the    
 side or front to above her ankles.    
 A button hook was used to fasten      
 these.Her life style was  different.  </content>
