		<title>171984/85 Miners Strike</title>
		<content> People were low on money,hardly any of
 them thought much of the police.They  
 thought it was stupid the way the     
 police hit pickets,so they started to 
 call them{pigs.}The main thing they   
 said was that they were low on        
 clothes, but one said he had more     
 during the strike.They were proud     
 their dads had stuck out. One of them 
 said that their mum supported the     
 family.The word that was used most was
{"SCAB".}One of the{stikebreakers}had  
 scab written all over his house.Some  
 children said that they worried when  
 their dad's were on{picket.}Some of   
 the children didn't even notice the   
 strike was on.Some didn't think the   
 strike would last so long.Some of the 
 parents never went out unless it was a
 special occasion.The whole village    
 turned out to see the{miners}return to
 work.{COMMENTS OF INTERVIEWED CHILDREN</content>
