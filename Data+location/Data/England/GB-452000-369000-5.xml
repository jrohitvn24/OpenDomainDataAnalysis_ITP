		<content> Langwith Bassett School have a        
 swimming allocation of 1x1/2hr session
 per week.We travel to the Creswell    
 baths by bus.The swimming register is 
 called on a Wednesday when 25 pupils  
 are selected on a rota basis,with 3   
 others being elected reserves to cover
 for any absentees on Thursday,the day 
 of the swimming lesson.The coach picks
 the 25 pupils and 2 staff who         
 supervise all of their subsequent     
  activities except the actual swimming
 which is the responsibility of a      
 qualified swimming teacher.The        
 swimming period lasts for 1/2 an      
 hour,starting at 10.30a.m. during     
 which time the pupils are taught basic
 water skills in preparation for       
 passing their learners                
 certificate.Once you have passed your 
 learners,you can swim at the deep end 
 of the pool improving your swimming.  </content>
