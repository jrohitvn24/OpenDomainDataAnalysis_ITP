		<title>02DRAWDYKES CASTLE</title>
		<content>  Formely the home of the Aglionby     
 family from the time of the conqueror.
  The original castle was built from   
 materials of the Roman wall.In the    
 17th century it was nearly all taken  
 down and rebuilt by John Aglionby ,   
 the then  recorder of Carlisle. He    
 placed the 3 large carved heads on the
 parapets-probably Roman. In 1765 the  
 original building was taken down and  
 the present farm house built.Many     
 Roman inscriptions have been found and
 one says  "DIS MANIBUS MARCI TROAINI  
 AUGUSTNI AMMILLUSFMA CONIUX KARISS    
 (IMA).The translation is "to the      
 spirits of the departed and of Marcus 
 Troianus Augustinus. His dearest      
 wife Aelia Ammillusima had this       
 tombstone set up".                    
   The castle is now derelict but Mrs  
 Hammond lives at the farm by Drawdykes
 castle. by S Khawam C Stratton        </content>
