		<content> A NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT             
 Near to our school there is a new     
 housing estate.It is called Hope Fold 
 Farm Estate because before the new    
 houses were built there was a farm    
 there.                                
      The estate overlooks a large     
 reservoir which has had to be partly  
 drained to build on.The site was      
 chosen because it was the only large  
 area of land available at the         
 time.Much of the other land nearby    
 cannot be built on because it is marsh
 land.Before they started building in  
 1981,7 terraced houses were demolished
 and the owners rehoused to make room  
 for the new buildings.There are now 97
 semi_detached houses each with a      
 garden,front and back.There are 7     
 still unoccupied but they hope to     
 finish by July 1986.
