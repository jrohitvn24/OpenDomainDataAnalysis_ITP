		<title>03CHURCH IN FLAX BOURTON</title>
		<content> Since the two parishes of Flax Bourton
 and Barrow Gurney are quite small and 
 join each other the Rector of Flax    
 Bourton is also the Vicar of Barrow   
 Gurney.He also is Chaplin at Barrow   
 Hospital.The Flax Bourton church is   
 dedicated to St. Micheal and all      
 Angels.It is not very beautiful and is
 quite small.Barrow Gurney is quite the
 opposite.The two churches take it in  
 turns to have services but the        
 population who come is very few.There 
 are many Church events including the  
 fete,outings and jumble sale.Barrow   
 Gurney church is dedicated to St.Mary 
 and St. Edward.They both have a tower 
 which you climb up winding stairs you 
 have a lovely view of both parishes.
