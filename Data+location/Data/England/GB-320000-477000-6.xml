		<content>    Sir Leonard although officially    
 retired still takes an active part in 
 social and professional activities in 
 the district and chairs many worthy   
 and varied societies and institutes.  
    Another interesting character      
 interviewed by the research group,    
 having lived in Ireleth for the past  
 12 years and who previously resided in
 Askam for 36 years, naturally has firm
 views on the environment. This local  
 resident, Mr. Bleasdale, remembers    
 Askam when there were just a few      
 houses and he attended St. Peters     
 School in Ireleth, which was much     
 smaller than it is today. This school,
 though small compared with some modern
 standards, however, does, in fact,    
 contain a plaque mentioning the       
 original Domesday Book Survey. Ireleth
 is the older of the two villages.
