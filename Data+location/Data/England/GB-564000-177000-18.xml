		<content>  To continue with Tilbury ,at{The     
{Spindles,}next to the Football Ground,
 there are privately-built houses in a 
 small estate.These were built in the  
 early 70's and are well-designed as   
 regard to insulation and use of space.
 They are rather crammed together and  
 have tiny gardens.                    
  {Linford}has some pleasant bungalows 
 of the 30's style, and an             
 ever-expanding estate of private      
 houses. These date from the mid 60's  
 and are still being added to in       
 1985.They are well-designed houses;   
 often built in terraces,but not all;  
 and of a variety of styles.           
   {East Tilbury}has some bungalows,a  
 majority of post-war council          
 houses,and a newer addition from the  
 early 70's.{West Tilbury}has pre-war  
 housing of patterned bricks,and some  
 cottages -mostly modernised.          </content>
