		<title>02    INGESTRE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Ingestre is a small village which was
 first established around the year     
1000 AD. and was owned by the Chetwynd 
family. Ingestre is situated about 5   
miles from Stafford. The population    
consists of approximately 100 people   
and they live  a few dwellings in the  
midst of a rural environment.          
  Within this setting there is a       
considerable amount of evidence        
relaying the local history. For        
example, there are homes which date    
back to the last century and new homes 
which have recently been  built, a     
feature of this is the conversion of   
an old stable into luxury flats.       
  This image of old and new aspects is 
also reflected in the buildings such   
as the   the church and hall which are 
set into the background of the golf    
club that occupies some of the land.
