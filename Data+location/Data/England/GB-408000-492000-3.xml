		<content>{THE BLOOD STAIN__}At Eastfield Grange 
 there is a blood stain on the floor   
 and the old lady who lived there used 
 to scrub the floor and it used to go  
 away and the next day it came back .  
 She thought that somebody had died    
 there.Her garage used to be a         
 slaughter house and  you can still see
 the slaughter ring.                   
{THE WHITE LADY--}The White Lady lives 
 in one of Petty's buildings. It is on 
 the Richmond road. Some people say    
 they have seen her but I do not think 
 they have. Some people say they have  
 seen her arm.                         
{THE SECRET TUNNEL__}There is supposed 
 to be a secret passage which runs from
 the Old Hall in the middle of the     
 village to the Manor House or Rock    
 Castle in Leyburn Parish.
