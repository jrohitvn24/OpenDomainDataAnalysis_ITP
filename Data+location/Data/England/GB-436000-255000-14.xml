		<title>14THE AIR RAID SHELTER</title>
		<content>   In our village of Bishops Itchington
 there is an{Air Raid Shelter.} It is  
 hidden in a small kind of wood at the 
 end of High Street.  It is about seven
 feet deep and five feet wide, just the
 right size for us boys to play in.  I 
 like it because outside are some      
 brilliant trees to climb.  The trees  
 are as big as my house,{Fir Tree      
{Cottage.}It is also handy for when it 
 rains or snows.  You just go down into
 the shelter.  It is usually warm and  
 dry.                                  
    But I do not go up much now because
 living nearby are two big{dogs}which  
 bite.  Although, before the dogs were 
 there Michael, Daniel, Stuart and I   
   made the shelter our gang's         
 headquarters.                         
 We still like it a lot, although it is
 older than my dad.
