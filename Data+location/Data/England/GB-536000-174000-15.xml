		<title>15 A Stallholder's Life</title>
		<content>    Flowerstall passed down in family  
from Grandfather to father to son.     
Grandfather worked in Lewisham before  
there was a market.He sold flowers     
from a basket years before the 2nd     
world war.Lewisham Market has now been 
licensed for 53 years.The stalls are   
mostly owned by long-standing          
families.The week begins"going up the  
road"(i.e.buying the flowers from      
Covent Garden,Nine Elms). When         
buying,a price is given &amp; the buyer    
bids for the lower price but always    
looking for the best quality.Once the  
buying is done the flowers are taken   
to be "stood up"in water in a cool,dry 
shed.This happens most as fresh        
flowers are al always  bought when     
needed.The stall has to be packed out  
quickly &amp; expertly Trading is from     
9.00am to 6.00pm.There are many regular
customers.                             </content>
