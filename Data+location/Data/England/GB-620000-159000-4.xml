		<content>{    The Great Stour}was dredged fifty 
 years ago. At West Stourmouth  a big  
 pump sucks up water and pumps it to   
 the{Great Stour.}There are five       
 diggers operating on the river, but   
 they can bring in more if needed.     
 Alongside the{Great Stour}at{Stodmarsh
 are reed beds and by the{Little Stour 
 is mainly farm land. The{Great Stour  
 is about seventeen metres wide and    
 the{Little Stour}is about seven metres
 wide. The{Great Stour}is tidal and    
 slightly salty. The River Board       
 maintain the river, cutting the weeds 
 and banks twice a year. The{Lampen    
{Stream}runs through Stodmarsh. It is  
 only about four miles long and one and
 a half metres wide.                   
     The{Great Stour}is navigable by   
 quite big motor launches which can    
 come up river from the sea.
