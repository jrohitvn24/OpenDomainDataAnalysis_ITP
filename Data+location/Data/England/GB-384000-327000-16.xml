		<title>16WORSTON RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The proprietor of the stables runs a  
 riding school and livery yard.  Some  
 of the horses are hers and she houses 
 others.  The horses at livery are kept
 for the owner and fed and groomed for 
 a fixed price, currently between Â£28  
 and Â£53 per week.  Young horses can be
 broken in here.                       
 These days one can pay about Â£175 for 
 a suitable horse for a child and about
 Â£3,000 for a horse for cross-breeding.
 The stables proprietor also takes part
 in the sport of driving:  2 or 4      
 horses pulling a 2-passenger vehicle  
 around an obstacle course.  Driving   
 has been popularised by the Duke of   
 Edinburgh.  Sometimes she drives in a 
 procession and occasionally the       
 carriages are used to transport a     
 newly-married couple to their         
 reception.
