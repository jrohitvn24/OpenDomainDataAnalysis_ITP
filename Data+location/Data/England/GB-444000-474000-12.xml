		<title>12CHANGING FACE OF SESSAY 2</title>
		<content>{(Continued from p.11)                 
 Now people move in from outside the   
 village, many to retire.  In the      
 future it is much less likely that    
 people will live out their whole lives
 from cradle to grave here. {Buildings 
 too change: older ones are houses     
 built in local materials; newer ones  
 tend to be red-brick bungalows. These 
 are just a few of the numerous changes
 taking place. In its truest sense a   
 village is a community. In the past,  
 the relative isolation and limited    
 occupations shaped that community.    
 The{communications revolution}has     
 changed the world and Sessay has not  
 remained immune.  To survive as more  
 than a dormitory for nearby towns,    
 Sessay, like thousands of similar     
 villages, will need to keep, albeit   
 altered by circumstance, that sense of
 being an{individual community.        </content>
