		<title>19OGBOURNE PAST AND PRESENT</title>
		<content> The{census returns}for Ogbourne St    
 Andrew in 1881 show that a high       
 pecentage of the population worked on 
 farms or in jobs linked with          
{agriculture.}When a child left school 
 at 13 he was most likely to go to work
 on a farm,and he would probably work  
 there for the rest of his life.In 1881
{transport facilities}were not as good 
 as they are today.Therefore the       
 village would act as a small community
 having its own school,bakery and      
 church.Because of modern transport    
 facilities the village does not act   
 to day as a self supporting community.
 Clubs and suchlike are based at the   
 nearby town of{Marlborough.}It does   
 not have a state school or bakery,but 
 it does still have a church.The       
 agricultural emphasis is still there  
 in the surrounding area,but most      
 people commute to work elsewhere.     </content>
