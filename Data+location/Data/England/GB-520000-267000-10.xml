		<content> The site covers 100 acres. Before 1939
 it was all farmland. Then it began to 
 have gravel extracted in 1939. About  
 1966 a Refuse firm bought it. Then in 
 1978{Hunts Refuse Disposals Ltd}took  
 it over. Eight or nine firms use the  
 tip. The containers of rubbish are    
 brought in to the tip. There is soil  
 at the bottom, then two metres of     
 rubbish; then more soil covers it and 
 then more rubbish until it is 7 metres
 deep. They also dig trenches for the  
 liquid waste, lime sludge, sewage,    
 chemical waste and blood from         
 abattoirs.{A pest controller}comes    
 regularly and they spray the flies.   
 They use a{compactor}with spiky wheels
 on caterpillars. They repair their own
 machines. Eventually they will        
 landscape the area.
