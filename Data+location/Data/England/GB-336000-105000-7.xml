		<title>07     MY CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>   The cricket club that I go to is    
 called  Chard Cricket Club,every      
 Friday at 6 oclock.Then we go in to   
 the club house with the two           
 umpires and they are our coaches      
 too.                                  
 They tell us what we must do to keep  
 our wicket.After we have finished the 
 game we go into the club house and    
 have some orange drink. the game that 
 we play is basically like the grown   
 ups game but there are different from 
 the grown up game.To start we only    
 have 5 overs between each pair,and    
 when your out you have 8 runs taken   
 off the score and then you keep on    
 playing.Two of your players do the    
 scoring for your team.When we took    
 over the foreign countries  the       
 English taught the people there how   
 to play the game ,and now they have   
 better teams than us .                </content>
