		<title>12Life in a Village Stores.</title>
		<content>   Living in a shop is great because   
 you see everybody coming and going.   
 Every Wednesday my Mum and Dad go     
 shopping to buy stock for the shop.It 
 is a{newsagent}and{general stores}in  
 Matfield village,selling sweets,food, 
 novelties,wool and clothing.Sometimes 
 people come to place an advertisement 
 in the window.                        
   It is a hard life to live in a shop 
 because my Dad gets up at{5am}to bring
 in the papers.We open at{6.45am}and   
 close at{5.30pm,}except on Monday when
 we close at{1pm.}On Sunday we open    
 from{8am}to{1pm.}My Dad and Mum run   
 the shop with{two assistants,}and{9   
{paper boys}deliver the daily papers.  
 Friday is very busy because it is     
 their pay day.We have been away for a 
 few days{holiday,}but running the shop
 is a fulltime job and I can't remember
 having a long holiday.                </content>
