		<title>04The Quaker Meeting House</title>
		<content> The story of the Quakers dates back to
 1864 when John Sargent purchased the  
 Bobbin Mill at the bottom of the      
 village. He was a Quaker but the      
 nearest Quaker meeting house was at   
 Oakerthorpe, so he decided to hold    
 meetings in a cottage at the  bottom  
 of Bobbin Mill Hill.Soon other        
 Quakers joined him,including Thomas   
 Davidson who ran the grocer shop and  
 post office on the green, also the    
 local antiquarian.Before long John    
 Sargent and his friends disagreed with
 the London society of Quakers and in  
 1869 formed their own society at      
 Fritchley which continued for nearly  
 100 years.                            
 In 1897 the Quakers of Fritchley built
 a new meeting house on Chapel Street.
