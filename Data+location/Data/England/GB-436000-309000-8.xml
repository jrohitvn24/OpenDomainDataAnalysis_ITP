		<title>08Making Bricks at Heather</title>
		<content> On Wednesday May 15th, I came to      
 school with my dad.  He was going to  
 take me and five other children to the
 brickyard because we were going to    
 find out about brick making.  When we 
 arrived we went into the office.      
 Frank, who was Deputy Manager, took us
 around.  After we had been round we   
 asked some questions.  Altogether     
 550,000 bricks are made in a week.    
 The materials used to make bricks are 
 Kupar mild clay and water.  The       
 company has been going since early    
 1900.  They employ 555 people.  The   
 bricks are sent to the following      
 places: Scotland, Wales, Ireland,     
 Saudi Arabia, Germany, France, Italy  
 and Holland.  The greatest number of  
 bricks they have sold at once is 1    
 million 2 hundred thousand.  They have
 spent half a million pounds building  
 the new factory.                      </content>
