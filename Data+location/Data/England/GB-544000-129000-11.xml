		<title>11ASHDOWN FOREST RECREATION</title>
		<content> There are those who come for more     
 energetic and serious recreation.     
 Rambling clubs may travel from as far 
 away as Eastbourne and walk 12 miles  
 or so. The Wealdenway long distance   
 footpath passes through the area. It  
 is good country for horse-riding      
 except in very wet weather but riders 
 must have permits and keep to the     
 marked bridleways. Sometimes there are
 sponsored walks or rides for charity. 
 Hunting is allowed. Motor-bikes are   
 not. After a heavy fall of snow       
 toboganning is popular and a few      
 skiers generally appear. Orienteering,
 flying model remote control gliders,  
 dog-training, bird-watching,          
 pigeon-racing and fishing (by special 
 permission in Pippingford Park) are   
 among the hobbies which attract       
 enthusiasts to this part of the       
 Forest.                               </content>
