		<title>16Bevere Green Farm</title>
		<content> This mixed farm is owned by Mr and Mrs
 N B Gwillam who are helped by their   
 three sons. There are about 100 acres 
 of land. There is a 17th C Queen Anne 
 House but this is not the main        
 farmhouse. A 19th C farmhouse was     
 replaced in 1983 by a modern house.   
 They have 17 beef cattle, 10 ewes with
 19 lambs, hens and a cockrel, 2 horses
 and a dog. Most of their work nvolves 
 growing vegetables - runner beans,    
 cabbages, peas, cauliflowers, potatoes
 and sugar beet. Recently              
 hedgrows and fences have been removed 
 to make one large field from several  
 smaller ones. One filed - 28 acres in 
 size - is knwon as Battle Field and is
 believed to have been the site of a   
 Roman fortress. The Gwillam's have    
 left one part of their land           
 uncultivated to encourage the natural 
 flora. Many have already returned.    </content>
