		<title>03LOCAL HISTORY-BROADWELL</title>
		<content> he name BROADWELL comes from the well,
 round which Broadwell was built.This  
is a natural spring and has never been 
known to dry up,not even during the    
drought of 1976.The present well was   
built in 1901 and then rebuilt in      
1979.It was lined with limestone,and   
has two feet of bricks at the top.     
Broadwell does not have a Pub,as its   
original Pub was closed in the         
1700's,after a man was stabbed to      
death,following a drunken fight.       
The oldest building in Broadwell is the
barn which was built in Elizabethan    
Times.There used to be a Church,but    
this was destroyed by the Roundheads in
the Civil War.                         
To the S-W of Broadwell is Nelson's    
Quarry.This provided much of the       
limestone to build the houses.The      
quarrywas closed in the 1950's and is  
now flooded to a depth of 10 metres.   </content>
