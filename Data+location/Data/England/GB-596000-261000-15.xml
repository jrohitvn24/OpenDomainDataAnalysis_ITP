		<title>15MY HOUSE CLANDORE</title>
		<content> I am James Heather and I live in a    
 late Medieval house.My Mum and Dad are
 trying to repair it to its former     
 glory.My Dad is an antique dealer and 
 expert.My house used to be an inn.It  
 was named after Queen Elizabeth's     
 visit to Woolpit as the Crown Inn.    
 Later on it was a cafe called Clandore
 Cafe.At the bottom of our garden is   
 the church and conker trees.Last year 
 I got more than 300. I think my house 
 would be ideal as a history project of
 Woolpit asit is the second biggest    
 house in the area.The biggest house is
 the Swan.
