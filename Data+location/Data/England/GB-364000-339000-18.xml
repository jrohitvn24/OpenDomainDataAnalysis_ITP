 There are lots of things we would     
 like in the village - like a park or a
 Leisure Centre just to make Adderley  
 less boring. We would like more people
 in Adderley. There would be enough    
 room by the church for a Leisure      
 Centre, and seeing as B.M.X           
 competitions are popular now it would 
 be nice if we could have a racing     
 track. However, if we had these things
 in the field next to the church the   
 Rector might not be very pleased. We  
 could do with a few more shops        
 especially food shops. In the winter  
 it can be difficult to get to Market  
 Drayton because of the snow. We have  
 an old Railway track in Adderley and  
 there is a lot of wild life down      
 there. It would make a super Nature   
 Reserve.
