		<title>13CUSTOMS,XMAS TREE LIGHTING.</title>
		<content>When driving up in the car you could   
see the cubs' torches and feel the     
merry atmosphere of it all.And walking 
to stand in your place being greeted   
merrily by everyone.Every single person
was in a happy Christmassy             
mood.Everyone stood round dressed up in
warm coats and woollies and the younger
ones cluthing dolls or teddies to keep 
them company.You held a hymn sheet and 
waited expectantly.Firstly a few words 
were said by the Vicar then Christmas  
hymns were sung in various merry       
voices.An invited Mayor gave a speech  
then proudly lit the Christmas tree    
lights.The little ones were tugging at 
their mothers' sleeves saying "want to 
ghome now!"when they were interrupted  
by a deep voice inviting them to the   
Village hall for tea and biscuits.And  
the crowd full of Christmas spirit     
would troup along to the hall.         </content>
