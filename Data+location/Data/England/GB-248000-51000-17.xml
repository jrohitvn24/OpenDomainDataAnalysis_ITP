		<title>17THE PLYMSTOCK BROADWAY</title>
		<content>    The Broadway is a pedestrian       
{shopping precinct.}In our survey, we  
 found that it satisfied many of the   
 needs of the{older generation}in the  
 Plymstock area because:               
 1. It is very convenient.             
 2. It is not usually crowded.         
 3. It has free parking.               
 4. It has good service.               
 5. It has a good variety of{shops.    
    We found that most of the people   
 prefer shopping on the Broadway than  
 in the city centre.                   
    It has some disadvantages as the   
 range of clothes shops is limited.    
    The majority of people shop weekly,
 only shopping 1-2 hours. Thursday is  
 the most popular day to shop and the  
 popular shops are Fine Fare, Co-op    
 and Woolworths. This is because they  
 are food shops and people need food   
 the most.                             </content>
