		<content> The Manor House, a Grade 2 listed     
 building, an early instance of        
 specialised planning and a well       
 preserved example of its style, stands
 to the South of the Church.  It was   
 built about 1730 on the site of an    
 earlier farmhouse, which had been     
 built on the site of the Commandery of
 the Knights of St. John.  Traces of   
 the original stone foundations are    
 extant in the cellar.  Original       
 Georgian fittings include doors, stone
 fireplace surrounds, moulded cornices,
 pine panelling in one room and re-used
 17th Century oak panelling in         
 another.  A scullery, added in        
 Victorian times, has been removed,    
 but a Music Room, added to the North  
 side, still remains.  In the garden   
 there are wrought iron gates, with    
 vine leaves, brought from Gopsall     
 Hall in 1951.                         </content>
