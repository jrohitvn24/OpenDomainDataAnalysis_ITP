		<content> In Rowney Green the children mostly go
 to school at Bealey nd Abbey in       
 Redditch.  The children of younger    
 than schol age go to a nursery in     
 alveschurch which is close by.  Some  
 children go to other schools.  There  
 is only one nursery school that we saw
 and it was hidden away.  There are no 
 other schools in walking distance.    
 Partrick Motors bought the area and   
 started a village with a school which 
 was started in 1880 with to pupils    
 and then it went to 30 pupils 15 years
 after it was built.  Then it was      
 pulled down in 1895 and built on by a 
 member of the Cadbury family.
