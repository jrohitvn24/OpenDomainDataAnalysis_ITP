		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> This survey block covers 2/3 of       
 Kingscote Parish and includes the main
 village built up area.  It includes   
 approximately 2/3 of the residences   
 counted in the 1981 census and 2/3 of 
 the voters on the 1985 electoral roll.
 We estimate from this that the        
{population}of the study area is in the
 region of 220.  This is a rural parish
 with one nucleated village and several
 outlying farms or hamlets of which    
 Calcot, Bagpath, Newington Bagpath and
 Lasborough were excluded from the     
 study area.  Most of the information  
 on pages 5-18 is based on             
 questionaires delivered throughout the
 study area. 50% of housholders in this
 area completed a{housing}questionaire 
 and 40% of residents completed a      
{lifestyles}survey if under ten year   
 olds are excluded.
