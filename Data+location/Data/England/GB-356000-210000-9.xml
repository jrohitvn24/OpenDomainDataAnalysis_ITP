		<content> Approximately a third of the area is  
 covered with{farmland-almost 100%     
{pasture land.Sheep rearing,stock      
{raising,a little dairy farming and hay
{making}is done.Spring and early summer
 time sees most activity.Lambs are born
 in March and ready for market in July.
 They might be sold in Gloucester or   
 Monmouth markets.Hay making is        
 important and there is some silage    
 making for winter{feed.The farms are  
{mostly smallholdings passed down      
{through families-some}don't pay and   
 the owner might have another job.Very 
 few employed in farming.Some people   
 have a quarter to half an acre for    
 keeping horses.One farm is now used as
 a riding stables and you can hire     
 horses for pony trekking.
