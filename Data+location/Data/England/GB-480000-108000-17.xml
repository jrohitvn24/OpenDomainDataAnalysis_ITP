		<title>17THE CHAPEL, NEAR FUNTINGTON</title>
		<content> In 1861 Chichester Cathedral's spire  
 collapsed. Some of the stone was used 
 to build a Congregational{Chapel}where
 the B2146 road meets the B2178 between
 East Ashling and Funtington. The first
 service in 1864 used text 1 Peter 2,7 
{The stone which the builders rejected 
{as worthless turned out to be the most
{important of all.}It had a Sunday     
 school.It closed as a Chapel and might
 have become a garage. It is let to the
 local{Scouts}who meet on Fridays. The 
 Cubs meet on Thursdays. Still called  
 The Chapel it has the old narrow      
 Funtington-Chichester road on one side
 The wider straighter faster new road  
 opened in 1967 on the other. The      
 building is 14m by 10m and over 6m    
 high with a slate roof. On the south  
 side are 6 windows with 4 more and    
 double-doors on the other. The scouts 
 have an activity area nearby.         </content>
