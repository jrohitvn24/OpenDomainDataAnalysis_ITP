		<title>16COMMUTING SURVEY,WEST MERSEA</title>
		<content> Most people who live in West Mersea   
 have to travel off the island to get  
 to work. This is because there are no 
 big factories or industries in West-  
 Mersea. As you can imagine there are  
 very few jobs and you are very lucky  
 if you manage to get a job on the     
 island. To give you an idea of people 
 who commute to work,we did a survey to
 show this. We went to four junior     
 classes and questioned the pupils.Very
 few hands were down when we asked "How
 many parents went off the Island to go
 to work". We found out that all       
 together in all 4 classes, there      
 were 62 people who work off the       
 Island, and 35 who work on the Island.
 We think that the people who work off 
 the Island travel to places like      
 Colchester, Chelmsford and            
 Ipswich, every day. Some even commute 
 to London.                            </content>
