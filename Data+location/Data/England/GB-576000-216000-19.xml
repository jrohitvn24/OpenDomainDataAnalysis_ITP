		<title>19River Brain</title>
		<content>   The only river to pass through this 
 area is the River Brain which is a    
 tributary of the River Blackwater. The
 river is only 14 miles long from its  
 source near Great Bardfield (where it 
 is known as Pod's Brook)until it joins
 the Blackwater just south of Witham.  
    The section of the river near White
 Notley is quite attractive and there  
 are footpaths nearby but the paths are
 oftrn very muddy and this is one of   
 the reasons why there are willow beds 
 close to the river.                   
    The road from the village to the   
 railway station crosses the river by  
 an old iron bridge which has a weight 
 restriction on it for traffic. Next to
 the bridge is a ford and when the     
 water level is low this pretty spot is
 popular with children for games.      
    The Essex Way footpath crosses the 
 river at White Notley.                </content>
