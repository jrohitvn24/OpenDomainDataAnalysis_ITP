		<content>    The buildings in Grimley village   
 usually follow the line of the road.  
 Most are brick built with tiled roofs.
 There are several old detached and    
 semi-detached cottages built of bricks
 from the local disused works. Some of 
 these cottages and a farm are owned by
 the Church. Five large detached and   
 a pair of semi-detached houses and    
 five bungalows/chalet bungalows have  
 recently been built. (Re: Historic    
 Houses). There are no council houses. 
    The buildings of Sinton Green foll-
 ow the perimeter of the Green and the 
 five radial roads. There are a few old
 detached timber-framed and semi-de-   
 tached Victorian cottages and farm    
 houses. There is a country house, and 
 large modern detached houses and bun- 
 galows. Eight pairs of semi-detached  
 dwellings are council owned. There is 
 a site for mobile homes.              </content>
