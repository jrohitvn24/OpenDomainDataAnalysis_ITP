 Manor House was once a private school 
it is now a private house, there used  
to be a blacksmiths shop and a small   
general shop in the village, these are 
also now private houses.               
 John Daykin, who died in about 1558,  
was the last catholic priest in the    
parish, he founded a trust to pay for  
the day school and old peoples         
accomodation. Since the school closed  
money from the trust is used to provide
grants to any child in the parish going
on to further education. A house       
consisting of six self contained flats 
was built to replace the old peoples   
accomodation, these flats are let out  
rent and rate free to any elderly      
people who qualify. There is one public
house in the village.
