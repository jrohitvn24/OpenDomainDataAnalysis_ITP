		<title>11MERTON HALL FARM, COVENTRY.</title>
		<content>   Merton Farm is a family farm.The    
 owner has lived there since birth.    
 Since then he has gained 40 cattle,   
 there is one cow to the acre.They also
 have a bit of labour.                 
   In 1984 he decided to  move up to   
 one hundred cows. He brought a new    
 tank to hold the extra milk. Together 
 with the new equipment this cost him  
 seventeen and a half thousand pounds. 
 But now the milk marketing board says 
 he cannot have more than 75 cows.     
   The farmer milks twice a day and    
 each cow gives{30 litres a day.}They  
 are milked by machine, 12 at a time.  
   He has a{computer}to help feed the  
 cows. It gives a print out at the end 
 of the day to say what each cow has   
 eaten.
