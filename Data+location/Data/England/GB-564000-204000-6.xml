		<title>06WRITTLE COUNTY JUNIOR SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Writtle County Junior School was      
 opened in September 1963.It replaced  
 the old junior and infant schools     
 which were housed in the buildings    
 which are now the village library     
 and the Christian Centre.             
      When the new school was first    
 opened it was a primary school, but   
 in 1968 aseparate infant school was   
 built.                                
      Over the years the primary school
 population has steadily declined and  
 is still declining.At the moment there
 are 240 children in the junior school 
 divided into eight classes.           
     A new headmistress, Mrs. S.M.     
 Fitzpatrick, was appointed in April   
 1985,after the retirement of the old  
 headmaster,Mr.R.S.Eveleigh,who had    
 been head since the opening of the    
 school in 1963.
