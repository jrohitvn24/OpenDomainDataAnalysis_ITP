		<title>05The Old Graveyard-Kinoulton</title>
		<content>      Our class walked to the old      
 graveyard. We went along Main Street  
 and up Needham Hill, and,after passing
 a house called 'Kinross', we left the 
 road and followed a bridle path to the
 site of the church of{St.Wilfrid. }   
      I thought it was just an ordinary
 field until I caught sight of grave-  
 stones.There is no trace of the actual
 church as it was pulled down in 1793  
 as it was in ruins then.However,      
 gravestones are still standing, many  
 of them in very good condition. They  
 are made of{slate}and the inscriptions
 are clearly seen.                     
      The oldest gravestone that we    
 could find had this inscription-{
