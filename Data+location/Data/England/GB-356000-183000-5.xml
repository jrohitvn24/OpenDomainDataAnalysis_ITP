		<content>     The farms,some of which are tenant
 farms are between 100&amp;200 acres. Crops
 of hay and silage are grown but very  
 little corn. The grassland mostly     
 actively maintained but with some     
 rough grazing, carries eight milking  
 herds. These are mostly Hereford X    
 Fresians,but one is pure Jersey.There 
 are two Hereford bulls and occasional 
 Charolais. One owner takes heifers on 
 contract, serves them by his bull,    
 keeps them till they calve, and       
 returns them. Many young stock are    
 reared for beef. There are six flocks 
 of sheep numbering 10 to 200.         
 Pheasants are reared on one farm.     
 There is one bee keeper.Some riding   
 horses are kept.A riding centre has a 
 number of horses for hire.
