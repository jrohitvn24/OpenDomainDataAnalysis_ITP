		<content> Within our block there seems to be a  
 division of{employment}from area to   
 area. The estate of Roseworth has     
 about 58% of the male adult population
 in work whereas about 88% of those    
 adults in private dwellings have      
 jobs.About 25% of the children in our 
 school have both parents working,     
 albeit most mams work on a{part-time  
 basis. Very few children leaving      
 school at sixteen in the area find    
 permanent full-time employment.       
 I.C.I.Billingham is the largest single
 employer in the area although not     
 necessarily in our "block".Male jobs  
 vary from factory workers,{tradesmen, 
 drivers,services and shops to         
{professional}grades of teachers,      
 doctors etc. in our block. Female jobs
 being mainly part-time are office,    
 hospital,pub,cleaning services and    
 shops.Few people work on the land.    </content>
