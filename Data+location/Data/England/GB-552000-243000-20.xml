		<title>20People working on 'Domesday'</title>
		<content>    We had only a few weeks in which to
 complete our Domesday survey, but we  
 learned a lot in that time.           
    Our school (R A Butler Junior      
 School, in Saffron Walden) was four   
 miles from the area to be surveyed, so
 we had to go by car each time we made 
 a visit.  Some of the children's      
 parents, and school staff, helped with
 transport.                            
    People whom we asked to talk to us 
 were very willing to help; they felt  
 the project was worthwhile because it 
 was being done by children.           
    Most of the research was done by:  
{Caroline Chesworth  :  Melinda Potter 
{Sally Winterbottom  :  Nick Jones     
{Victoria Coates     :  Trudy Ingham   
{Ben Pughe-Morgan    :  Tom Ratcliffe  
{Bridget McDermott   :  Joanne Piper   
{Rachel Dodsley      :  Nicholas Capon}
     and their teacher,{David Jarratt. </content>
