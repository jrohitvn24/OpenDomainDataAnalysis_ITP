		<title>15Playground Games</title>
		<content>     These examples of playground games
 were being played by the children of  
 Heybridge School in the Summer of     
 1985. The main individual and small   
 group games were hopscotch, marbles   
 and{skipping.}(There are some examples
 of skipping rhymes on Page 18). These 
 games explained below are large group 
 games.                                
 *Family Had or Bulldog*               
    Someone is chosen to be "up" and   
 all the other people stand in a semi  
 circle on the netball pitch.The people
 in the semi circle run to a certain   
 place,for example another semi circle 
 or a wall.To play, you need somewhere 
 to start and somewhere to run.If you  
 are caught by the "up" person while   
 you're running you are "up" as well.  
 This continues until everyone is      
 caught.The first one caught is the    
 first one "up" next time.             </content>
