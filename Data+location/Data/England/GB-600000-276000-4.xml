		<content>The farms in the area employ a few     
people, however arable farming is not  
labour intensive. Many of the smaller  
farms are run entirely by the families 
that own them. The people who run these
farms and small enterprises such as a  
hairdresser; agricultural, construction
and maintenance contractors, plumbers, 
and a motor mechanic are mostly self-  
employed and often do not employ anyone
else. The one agricultural &amp; veterinary
supplier does not employ anyone from   
within the area. Some people work at   
the poultry processing factory. Others 
in employment, work outside the area,  
some travelling daily to towns such as 
Bury St.Edmunds,Ipswich and Norwich.   
The unemployment rate is no worse than 
the average for the region of East     
Anglia as a whole.
