		<title>05GARDENING ON AN ALLOTMENT</title>
		<content> We interviewed a{gardener}and asked   
 him some questions. He showed us round
 his hut. It looked nice and cosy with 
 a kettle there for a nice cup of tea  
 or coffee. He didn't build the hut,   
 that was already there. He brought a  
 few things into the hut and painted it
 green and white. He has owned the     
 allotment for 17 years and it is in   
 good condition. He has lots of        
{greenhouses}and says that he likes    
 growing food to make a little money.  
 He was growing{green beans, tomatoes  
{(in a greenhouse), cabbages &amp; runner  
{beans.}He likes growing food more than
 flowers and spends five or six hours a
 day on the allotment (except Saturday 
 &amp; Sunday).                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
