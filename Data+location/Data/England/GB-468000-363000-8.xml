		<title>08THE NEWSHEET OF KNEESALL,1</title>
		<content>{Mrs Tapper}and{Mrs Widdowson}came     
 to school to show us how to the       
 Kneesall Knatter is put together.The  
 ladies are the editors of the         
 newsheet.The Kneesall Knatter's name  
 was created in a competition and      
 decided at the church fete.There was a
 former vicar called{Rev. Billy James. 
 He stopped being the vicar of Kneesall
 and it was decided by the{Parish      
{Council}to branch out on their own and
 produce a news letter for the Kneesall
 area.                                 
  When they are writing the newsheet   
 the editors meet together one day each
 month.All the people around Kneesall  
 bring their news in or send it in by  
 telephone. Then they put it on a      
 date sheet which has the dates on one 
 side and they write down what is      
 happening on the sheet.
