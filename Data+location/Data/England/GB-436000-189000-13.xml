		<content> A scouting official came to school. We
 learned that while the numbers of     
 scouts in G.B. is dropping due to a   
 fall in birthrate, Grove Scout numbers
 have risen dramatically recently due  
 to young families who have come to    
 Grove to live. Another cub scout pack 
 is to be formed in June, named Grove  
 Kestrels. Other packs are the Hawks,  
 Eagles and Falcons. Cub scouts are for
 boys aged 8 - 10.5 years. Two Beaver  
 packs are also starting for boys aged 
 6-8 years. The two scout packs        
 together have 45 members. Scouts are  
 boys aged 10-16 years. The Grove      
 Venture Scouts for boys and girls aged
 16-21 years have 12 members. The Grove
 Scout Headquarters is situated in the 
 Recreation Ground, so the packs have  
 good facilities. Denchworth has only  
 two cub scouts who have to go to West 
 Hanney.                               </content>
