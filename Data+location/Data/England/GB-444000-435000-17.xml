		<title>17A FARMER'S STORY</title>
		<content>   I usually wake up at 6.00am and have
 a cup of tea. I have my breakfast of  
 cornflakes and toast, and then I wash 
 up, which I like doing. By 7.00am I am
 working.                              
   I see to the cattle which I am fond 
 of working with. In spring when  we're
 planting I sometimes work till 9.00pm.
 In autumn I finish earlier, about     
 4.30pm. Autumn and spring are planting
 times, and February sees me out in the
 fields after the winter. In spring and
 summer I go out to work again even    
 after tea, but I like to come in to   
 watch the news on the television.     
   After I have eaten my dinner, I like
 to read the newspaper in my spare     
 time. I am fond of dogs. Sometimes I  
 like to go out for a meal. I go in my 
 car, a Ford Escort.
