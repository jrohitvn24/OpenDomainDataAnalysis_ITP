    Revel means be merry and happy most
 people have a party on the occasion.  
    We have a revel in BISH_NYM every  
 year in{MAY.}On the night before the  
{Revel,}there were some people's names 
 put into a hat to see who was going   
 to be the{Revel queen}and also there  
 was needed two princesses.            
 The draw was made later on that night.
 The two princesses were Julie Rollins 
 aged 9\, the second princess was      
 Heather Sparkes age 6 and the Revel   
 queen was to be Celia Fields age 14.  
    It was Mr.DARTS trailer, there     
 was 16 people on the float. The school
 float was the shape of a rectangle.   
 There were trees in every corner of   
 the trailer and there were flowers all
 around the side of the trailer.
