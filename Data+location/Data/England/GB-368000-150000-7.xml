		<title>07KILMERSDON HOUSING</title>
		<content> Estate cottages represent about half  
 of Kilmersdon homes. The owner of the 
 estate has formed a Housing Assoc. to 
 which he has given most of the        
 properties and a programme of         
 modernisation is under way.           
 A central development of 7 old peoples
 bungalows with a warden's house and   
 meeting room has been completed in    
 l985. Kilmerdon village has just been 
 designated as a conservation area.    
 Many privately owned houses were      
 cottages bought from the Estate and   
 updated, in some cases two or more    
 being converted to make quite large   
 and attractive houses.                
 A small number of council houses      
 remain, others having been bought by  
 the occupants. ll new houses have been
 built since the war the first ever in 
 Kilmersdon on freehold land bought    
 from the Estate.                      </content>
