		<content> The goats are pedigree Anglo-Nubian   
 and they win consistently at shows.   
 The herd usually consists of 2 stud   
 males,4-6 milkers,3 goatlings from    
 1-2yrs.old and 3 kids from 0 to 1yr.  
 The milk is used for rearing kids,for 
 home use and sold deep-frozen for yog-
 hurt making and human consumption.    
 Stock is sold for breeding at home and
 world-wide. Surplus male kids are     
 reared for meat.                      
 The goats live in a large warm wooden 
 shed divided into pens with a feed and
 milking area at one end.Water and     
 electricity are laid on in the shed.  
 The goats are housed all winter but in
 summer go out to graze in paddocks.   
 The goats are fed a coarse mix of con-
 centrates made up of rolled barley and
 oats,flaked maize,fishmeal &amp;  minerals
 They also eat hay,barley and pea straw
 and root-crops and greens in season.  </content>
