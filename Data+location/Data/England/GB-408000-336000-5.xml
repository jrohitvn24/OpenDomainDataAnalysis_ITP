		<title>05THE AREA OF WOODSEAT</title>
		<content> Woodseat was a Garden Centre for 12   
 years, and only closed down very      
 recently. Mr.A.Nash who owns Woodseat,
 has 12-14 acres, although the Garden  
 Centre used to cover 1200 acres. The  
 majority of this acreage was covered  
 with trees, although a wide variety of
 plants,flowers,shrubs and fruits were 
 also grown. Today, Mr.Nash keeps only 
 a few plants as his own. Woodseat was 
 once the property of Colin Minten     
 Campbell who was the founder of Minten
 china. Mr.Nash has a few Minten plates
 and also a porcelain statue of        
 Campbell. Campbell set up his own     
 business making Minten pots. His      
 father was also born on the estate,   
 but the original house is now only a  
 ruin, so the Nash family have         
 constructed several new buildings for 
 their previous business and as their  
 home.                                 </content>
