		<content>{5.30p.m.}Return home avoiding main    
 roads again - the majority of my      
 journey is on country roads.          
{6.00p.m.}Arrive home where my wife has
 a cooked meal ready which we share    
 with the children.                    
{Evening.}Variety of jobs - gardening, 
 decorating, general DIY; or visiting  
 relations; or playing with the        
 children; listening to records,       
 reading or watching television.       
{11.00p.m.-12.30a.m.}Anytime between   
 these times is usually bedtime.       
{Weekends and Holidays.} Obviously the 
 normal routine alters in that we don't
 get up so early and the day is spent  
 visiting interesting buildings/parks/ 
 museums or shopping or DIY in the     
 house or caravan. In the summer we    
 tend to use the caravan fairly        
 regularly for weekends away,          
 especially bank holiday weekends.     </content>
