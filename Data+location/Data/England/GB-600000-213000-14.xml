		<title>14MERSEA 80 YEARS AGO.</title>
		<content> I talked to Mrs King who used to live 
 in the Mill in Mill Road,which was    
 demolished after being hit by a bomb  
 during the second world war.I asked   
 Mrs King what had changed the most on 
 Mersea Island.She said,"The thing that
 has changed the most on Mersea is the 
 number of people." Behind the Mill was
 a slaughter house,the bones are       
 still there.Mrs King said, "It was    
 very good fun living in the Mill".Some
 of the shops which were around 80     
 years ago are still there.            
     "The biggest change, though, is   
 the difference in the number of people
 living on the island," she said."There
 are so many more people now than there
 used to be."                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
