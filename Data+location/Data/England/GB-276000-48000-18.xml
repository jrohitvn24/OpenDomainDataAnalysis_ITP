		<content> 36% of farmers seem to go on holiday  
 once a year; 13% go twice a year; 28% 
 never go on holiday and 23% sometimes 
 have a holiday. About 90% of farmers  
 don't have a regular day off.9% do    
 have a regular day off; 1% have half a
 day off. We found that farmers had a  
 variety of interests, these include   
 some ball sports, which are football, 
 table tennis, golf and cricket. Other 
 out door activites are hunting, horse 
 riding, shooting, swimming and folk   
 dancing. Less energetic activities    
 include piano playing, reading,       
 spinning and gardening. Other people  
 like to watch television. We found out
 that it was mainly the women that like
 to garden, where as it was the men    
 that liked the ball sports. We found  
 that the farmers that took holidays   
 mostly went abroad.
