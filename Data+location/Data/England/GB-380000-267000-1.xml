		<content> The region surveyed by us is in the   
 mainly rural area of{The Wyre Forest  
{District,}bordering both sides of a   
 stretch of the River Severn.{Stourport
{on Severn}is the nearest town.The area
 is of mixed farming and fruit growing.
 Some farms grow soft fruits and       
 vegetables for the "Pick your own"    
 variety.Much wood land still abounds  
 but some has given way to farm land   
 and housing.The former took place in  
 World War 2 and the latter were built 
 post war.People commute from this area
 to many Midland cities.Village life is
 not what it was.Sub Post Offices and  
 Village Stores have closed.Caravan    
 sites and holiday chalets spring up   
 alongside the river.The area has much 
 to offer in the form of recreational  
 pursuits,fishing and boating to name  
 but two.
