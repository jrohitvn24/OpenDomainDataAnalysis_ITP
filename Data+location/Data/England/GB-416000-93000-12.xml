		<title>12Burton School Field</title>
		<content> It would be sad to lose it for houses 
 as Burton already has many new        
 developments, but maybe the could     
 raise the needed money without selling
 our field.                            
                                       
                                       
 If the field goes it would be lost    
 for ever and we should not be able to 
 use it or get it back.  We would not  
 be able to have football matches on   
 home grounds.  People do not          
 understand what our field means to us.
