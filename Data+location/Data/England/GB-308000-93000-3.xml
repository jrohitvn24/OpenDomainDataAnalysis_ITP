		<title>03THE TOWN OF OTTERY</title>
		<content> Ottery St Mary is situated in between 
 East Hill and West Hill. There is a   
 river that runs through and round     
 Ottery and of course it is called the 
 river Otter. We have three schools: a 
 primary school, secondary school and a
 private school. In all the schools the
 pupils wear uniform. In the town we   
 have three bakers that bake fresh     
 bread, an axe shop, some of the       
 butchers slaughter their own meat. The
 shops are very good and we have a     
 variety of them. There are several    
 churches: a Parish church, a United   
 Reform the Roman Catholic the Plymouth
 Brethren and a Methodist Chapel. Our  
 Parish Church was modelled on Exeter  
 Cathedral so it is sort of a mini     
 Exeter Cathedral . Up by the Parish   
 Church there is quite a big library   
 and it has a lot of books. There are  
                                       </content>
