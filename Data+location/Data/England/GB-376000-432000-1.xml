		<content> The River Calder splits the town into 
 northern and southern areas and the   
 A671 creates a further division.      
 The name Padiham is derived from the  
 original owners, the sons of{Paddi of 
{Cockersands Abbey.}1241 is the        
 earliest date for the spelling{       
{Padiham.}The town has an area of 4    
 square kilometres and the population  
 has remained stable at around 10000   
 for thirty years.  The original       
 industries of the town in the 13th    
 century were coal mining and corn     
 milling. From the 18th century until  
 the 1930's 'King Cotton' reigned      
 supreme.                              
 Even though the cotton industry has   
 declined, it still plays a minor role 
 in the manufacture of related products
 such as parachutes, velvet, bandages, 
 survival equipment, handkerchiefs and 
 traditional cotton cloth.             </content>
