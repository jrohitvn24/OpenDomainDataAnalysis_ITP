		<title>07Friday with Kirsty (1)</title>
		<content>  On Fridays I usually get up at       
7.50p.m. I get washed and dressed and  
have my breakfast. This is usually     
toast and a cup of tea. After that my  
brother and i set off for school. My   
brother's name is Darran. He is        
fourteen years old and he goes to      
Penwortham Priory High School.         
  I get to school at about twenty to   
eight.I play with Mandy, Carla and     
Donna. At five to nine we go into      
school and hang our coats up. We go to 
our classroom where our teacher,       
Mrs.Moore, checks the register. Then we
go into assembly, which is taken by our
headmaster, Mr.Bond.                   
  During the morning we do Maths and   
English. Sometimes we have homework    
from the day before so we have to mark 
that. Friday is dinner money day.      
Dinners cost two pounds fifty-five     
pence each week.(Contd.)               </content>
