		<title>14FESTIVALS IN INKBERROW.</title>
		<content> Lots of things happen every year in   
 Inkberrow.There is a fun run,a school 
 fete.and Horse show.Once a year there 
 is a concert in the village hall given
 by local singers and musicians.We have
 two sports days,one for playgroup and 
 one for school.The teachers always    
 tell you just to enjoy it if you don't
 come 1st,2nd,or 3rd,but this year one 
 girl cried because she came last.On   
 Mother's Day we get flowers in church 
 to give to our mums.The Cubs and      
 Scouts have a bonfire on Bonfire night
 and you can have hot dogs.For the last
 few years,the village has put on a    
 religious musical in the church around
 Easter time.Children and grown ups    
 sing and there is a big orchestra and 
 the composer comes to conduct it.The  
 old Doctor always puts the flag up on 
 his flagpole in his garden on special 
 days.                                 </content>
