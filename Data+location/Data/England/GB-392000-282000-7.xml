		<content> Here are some points of historical    
 interest about where we live.For      
 instance Robert Webster,who advertised
 on his wife's grave.                  
 He was born April 19th 1850.He died on
 November 6th  1922.He was 72 years    
 old. This is what he wrote on the     
 stone:- 'Ye Olde Antique Shoppe       
 Lye 'One night the stone was taken    
 down and thrown into a nearby field.It
 was put back but caused a great deal  
 of bad feeling and was replaced with  
 another one at a later date.          
 Lutley Mill at the bottom of Drews    
 Holloway was one of the first mills to
 forge metal as well as grind corn.    
 Cradley is famous for its chain making
 and it made the chain and anchor for  
 the Titanic.There were quite a few    
 mines in Cradley because it was part  
 of the Black Country.
