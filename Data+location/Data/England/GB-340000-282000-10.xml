		<title>10The Cattle Ring.</title>
		<content>   The weight was then chalked on a    
 board for everybody to see.Farmers bid
 on the cattle they want and the       
 auctioneer takes the bids quickly.When
 there are no more bids the auctioneer 
 bangs his hammer and the steer is     
 sold.The buyer's name is recorded and 
 sent up to the office on a pulley.    
   The selling is very noisy and       
 everything moves very quickly.A team  
 of men help to put the cattle into the
 ring and to get them out after they   
 have been sold.                       
   The auctioneer's name was Mr. Leslie
 Thomas .There were 61 cattle for sale 
 today but as three were rejected only 
 58 sales went through.563 sheep were  
 for sale 10 of which were rejects.    
   Mr. Thomas has no connection with   
 the McCartneys,a family concern in    
 Craven Arms for many years.
