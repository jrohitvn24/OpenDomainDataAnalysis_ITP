		<title>15CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> Whilst modern agricultural methods    
 have drastically altered the          
 environment, an abundance of natural  
 flora and fauna are still to be found 
 in the hedgerows, woods and along the 
 banks of the River Leadon. To         
 encourage the enjoyment of the        
 countryside and conservation, Hartpury
 Parish Council have produced a booklet
 called "Walking around Hartpury" which
 describes all the parish footpaths,   
 many of which have been cleared,and   
 signs and stiles erected.To replace   
 the elms destroyed by disease, a      
 variety of coniferous and deciduous   
 trees, mainly oaks, have been planted 
 in Hartpury,especially on land        
 belonging to Corsend Farm.In 1984     
 Catsbury Wood was completely cleared  
 and replanted with oak, sweet chestnut
 and alder.
