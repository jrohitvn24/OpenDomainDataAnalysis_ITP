		<title>16GOSS HALL</title>
		<content>  Goss Hall bestrides the 700ft.       
 contour line just below the coach road
 from Overton Hall that joins the      
 Matlock-Chesterfield road. Below it is
 the valley of the Amber with Ashover  
 village to the right and to the left  
 is Stone Edge and the dark moors of   
 Chatsworth.There are written recordS  
 of this house which is well over 300  
 years old but no-one seems quite      
 sure if it is Goss Hall or Gorse Hall.
        In the 17th Century the land   
 belonged to the Perpoynts (now        
 Pierrepont), the Babingtons of Dethick
 and Sir Thomas Reresby,and possibly,  
 briefly to Sir Walter Raleigh. It is  
 almost certainly Elizabethan and the  
 estate covers 44 acres.               
 One family sold the estate in 1957    
 driven out,so it is said,by a         
 pipe-smoking ghost whose tobacco      
 smoke filled the house each night.    </content>
