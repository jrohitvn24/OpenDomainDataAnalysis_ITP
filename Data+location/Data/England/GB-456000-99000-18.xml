		<title>18THE MEASURED MILE.</title>
		<content>    Boat Builders need to know a boats 
{R.P.M.}They check this by using the   
 measured mile.They have to line up two
 posts ,the higher one by Privett      
 Road,the shorter one on Browndown,a   
 third is located at Gilkicker.They    
 must make at least four to six runs in
 both directions to allow for the wind 
 and tide.                             
 The boats must keep a{steady course   
 and check the{distance}from a chart as
 these measured miles are not always a 
 sea mile.The lenth of the one in our  
 area is{7997 feet}long.               
 There are 14 similar measured miles in
 the British Isles mostly used by      
 shallow water vessels because larger  
 and faster vessels cause too much     
 wash.They test the boats 1/2 a mile   
 off shore, where it is 9 fathoms deep.
