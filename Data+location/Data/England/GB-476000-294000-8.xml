		<title>08HISTORY IN HALLATON TODAY 2</title>
		<content>  Hallaton was one of the most         
 important towns in Leicestershire. Its
 prosperity is reflected in the size   
 and imposing nature of the church     
 which dates from Norman times. Many   
 ancient houses are still standing, and
 over 10% of the 130 or so houses are  
 thatched. For example the Bewicke Arms
 and cottages round the Cross are over 
 300 years old, and in Hunts Lane there
 are houses of Cruck construction with 
 the original wattle and daub in       
 places. One other converted house     
 still has its original mud walls on   
 two sides. In Churchgate there are two
 cottages owned by the Church which    
 were originally three, bought in 1747 
 for poor ladies of the village and    
 still used today for that purpose.    
 Hallaton Charity cottages were built  
 in 1842 and the Stenning cottages in  
 1926.                                 </content>
