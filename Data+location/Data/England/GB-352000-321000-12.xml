		<content>   We found out from the questionnaires
 that the people in{Shawbury}have a    
 variety of jobs.                      
   We put the jobs into 10 categaries. 
 These are R.A.F,Professional,         
 Government,Skilled Manual,Unskilled   
 Manual,Clerical,Housewives,Unemployed 
 and Retired.                          
   The category with the greatest      
 number of people working in it was the
{R.A.F. 26%}of the people worked on    
 the{R.A.F.}station.                   
   The next largest group were the {   
{housewives}with 19%.There are 14% of  
 people who are{retired.}Out of the    
 other groups{skilled manual}had 11%,  
{unskilled manual}had 4%.{Clerical}had 
 quite a low number of 9%.{Professional
 and{government}had close numbers of 6%
 and 5%. We were amazed to see only 1% 
 of people were{unemployed}which       
 shows Shawbury has high employment.   </content>
