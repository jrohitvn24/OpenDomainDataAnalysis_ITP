{HEALTH}-There are no doctors' or      
 dentists' surgeries in the area, so   
 local people travel to Worcester or   
 Pershore health centres.              
{EDUCATION}-There are now no schools in
 the area. Children therefore travel to
 Drakes Broughton to first schools, to 
 Pinvin to attend Middle School and    
 then to Pershore High School, a       
 Comprehensive. Many families in the   
 area send their children to           
 independent schools in Worcester City.
{COMMUNICATIONS}-Spetchley has retained
 its own tiny telephone exchange within
 the Worcester area. Its code is 090565
 and although fully automated, it takes
 a few extra seconds to connect. The   
 small sub post office at Sneachill is 
 also the area's only village store.   
 Postal collections are made three     
 times each day.                       </content>
