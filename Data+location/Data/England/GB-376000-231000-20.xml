		<title>20Traffic Census</title>
		<content> On Monday 15th July 1985 we did a     
 Traffic Census.We did the Motorway    
 (M.50),the cross roads and the lane   
 which goes past our school.We started 
 from 11.45-12.10am.On the Motorway the
 were 253 cars,151 lorries,6 caravans,2
 coaches and 1 horse box.On the roads  
 there were 28 cars,4 lorries and 1    
 bicycle.On the lane past Pendock      
 School there were only 7 cars,3       
 tractors,1 lorry and one bicycle.If we
 went to the Motorway on a Saturday we 
 would probably find more vehicles     
 because it is a sort of holiday,the   
 same with the other two roads.        
                There are less cars on 
 the lane past the school,because there
 aren't many houses and it isn't an    
 important road.The only time when     
 there are a lot of cars is when people
 pick children up from school or when  
 someone's having a party.             </content>
