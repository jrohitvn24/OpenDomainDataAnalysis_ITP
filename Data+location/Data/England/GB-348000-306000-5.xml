		<title>05Moorlands Kennels,Condover.</title>
		<content>   The Kennels used to be Condover     
 Railway Station.The last train ran on 
 the lines in 1961.When Mr.and Mrs.    
 Austin bought the Station,there was no
 electricity.In the garden there was a 
 60 feet deep well that was used by the
 engines.                              
   In 1970 they started the Kennels.Up 
 to 16 cats and 40 dogs can stay for up
 to 6 months at a cost of Â£2 a night.  
 The cats are kept in cages in a little
 hut.They don't put cats together in   
 case they fight but dogs may share.The
 cats have to have stone hot water     
 bottles in case they burst them and   
 similarly dogs are not allowed bean   
 bags to sleep on for the same reason. 
   In 1980 Mrs.Austin judged the Sky   
 Terriers at Crufts.She also breeds    
 Sky Terriers and had a champion dog   
 called Highland Fling which won 'Best 
 of Breed' at Crufts.                  </content>
