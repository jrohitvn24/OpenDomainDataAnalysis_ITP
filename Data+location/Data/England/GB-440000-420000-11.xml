		<content> The majority of the people live in    
 owner occupied semi-detached or       
 terraced housing.Most take their      
 holidays in England,the East coast    
 being very popular.They take one or   
 two main holidays per year but do     
 spend weekends away in their caravans.
 Those who do not have a car are in the
 minority and a large majority either  
 owned or rented a video.On average    
 those interviewed went out three      
 nights per week and Public Houses and 
 Working Mens Clubs were the most      
 popular forms of entertainment,eating 
 out,espcially at weekends,however,was 
 popular.Very few people actively take 
 part in any sports but many women did 
 attend Keep Fit classes. Most         
 households had at least one full time 
 wage earner ,manual work being the    
 most common but many women did do some
 form of part time work.               </content>
