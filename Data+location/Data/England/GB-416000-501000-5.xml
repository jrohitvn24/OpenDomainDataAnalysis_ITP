		<title>05St.Mary's Church-The Rector</title>
		<content> Services:I have 3 or 4 services on    
 Sunday and 1 at least on other days   
 except Monday and Saturday.           
 Costs: St. Mary's in Richmond needs   
 about Â£20,000 a year.About a third of 
 this goes to people who work for the  
 church,a tenth we give to people in   
 need like Ethiopia and the rest pays  
 for the oil,electricity,cleaning and  
 other things for the church building. 
 Furniture:The choir stalls were       
 brought from Easby Abbey about 350    
 years ago.All the furniture in the    
 Green Howards Chapel, the organ casing
 and the pulpit were made by Mousie    
 Thompson of Kilburn.                  
 Repairs:St.Mary's needs about Â£370,000
 for repairs especially on the roof.   
{My}Job:I like it because it is        
{always }different;meeting different   
 people,never the same two days running
 there is always more work to be done. </content>
