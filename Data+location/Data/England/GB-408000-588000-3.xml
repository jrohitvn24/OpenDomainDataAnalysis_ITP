		<content>   Woodland. The woodland in this area 
 is nearly all coniferous _ larch and  
 spruce, which are grown in a rotation 
 of between 45 and 80 years depending  
 on climatic and economic factors. All 
 the woodland work- planting, trimming,
 felling and fencing, is contracted out
 by the landowner.                     
   The trees are grown for the pulp    
 manufacturing industry and fencing    
 posts. All the fencing material is    
 processed by pressure impregnated     
 preservatives at the woodmill at      
 Netherwitton.                         
   Game rearing: Pheasant and partridge
 are reared for the Netherwitton shoot 
 and for sale to other shoots.         
   Shooting: One day shoots are run on 
 a commercial basis for foreign and    
 British customers- pheasant, partidge,
 duck and roe-deer stalking. There is  
 some day let fishing for trout.       </content>
