		<title>11Children in Bearwood (7)</title>
		<content>  We live in Bearwood and we like it   
 here. We like Bearwood because it has 
 lots of good things to do. There's a  
{swimming pool, a library, a sports    
{stadium, a park and some woods.       
  We go to many other activities. Our  
 school has a{playscheme}after school  
 every evening. We go to{Girls Brigade,
{Adventurers, Gymnastics, tap dancing  
{and Ballet.                           
  We like doing our mum's shopping     
 because you get a chance to see your  
 friends and teachers. Bearwood is a   
 good place for young and old as there 
 is something for everybody.           
  We wish people would remember to put 
 their{litter}in the bins and not let  
 their{dogs}foul the pavements.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
