		<title>18Cropthorne Annual Walkabout</title>
		<content> In 1975 it was thought that the       
 natural beauty of our village with its
 private gardens reaching down to the  
 Avon might well be used to advantage  
 to help with the cost of maintaining  
 and running the Church. Thus, our{    
{"Walkabout"}was born. At first on a   
 very modest scale - a few gardens     
 open,refreshments,flowers in the      
 church and locally made jam and cakes 
 for sale. It was held during{the first
{weekend in May}and suprisingly,many   
 visitors came.                        
 Now the{Cropthorne Walkabout}has      
 become well-known some{3500 visitors  
 come annually to view the             
{gardens,}admire the{Church floral     
{displays}and to buy locally produced  
{craft items, cakes and preserves.     
 A very rural scene,enhanced by{Maypole
{dancing}by the schoolchildren,{Morris 
{Dancers}and a{Brass Band.             </content>
