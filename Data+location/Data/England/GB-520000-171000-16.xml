		<content>The main A3 London to Portsmouth Road  
bisects this Domesday Block.  It was   
widened in the late fifties, to include
a major roundabout with underpass at   
Tibbet's Corner in the north-east and  
a busy junction at Robin Hood          
Roundabout in the south-west, a        
notorious bottleneck in the mornings.  
The traffic into London is heading for 
Hammersmith, Putney or Wandsworth      
Bridges across the River Thames.       
The traffic is much lighter at weekends
into London but heavier on a fine      
weekend going down to the coast.       
The heavy weekday traffic moving       
through this Domesday Block most of    
the day creates a special nuisance, is 
noisy, polluting and restrictive to    
local people.

see overleaf)
