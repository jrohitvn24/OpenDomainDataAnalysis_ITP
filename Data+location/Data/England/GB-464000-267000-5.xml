		<title>05EDUCATION IN EAST HADDON</title>
		<content>Northamptonshire are pursuing a        
commendable policy of protecting the   
small rural schools through the setting
up of Rural School Project Units. East 
Haddon is fortunate enough to belong to
the scheme based at Brixworth. The     
tangible benefits include a pool of    
central equipment for the use of       
schools, a minibus for school          
use,additional school based equipment, 
a peripatetic music teacher for class  
music and a head of centre who is an   
experienced teacher. This positive     
discrimination in favour of small      
schools is one of the reasons a school 
has been maintained in the village when
so many rural schools have been lost.
