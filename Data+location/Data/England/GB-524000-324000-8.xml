		<content>{  Springfields}is situated one mile   
 east of the town centre of Spalding.  
 It is a show garden for the           
 horticultural industry, displaying    
 Spring and Summer flowers. The gardens
 are open from March to September.     
   Springfields was founded in l966 and
 since that time well over two million 
 visitors have seen the displays of    
 flowers. It was founded to promote the
 study of tulips, daffodils, hyacinths 
 roses and other plants.               
    Many horticultural firms who       
 support the gardens supply much of    
 the plant material because the gardens
 are a registered charity and so only  
 receive money from visitors attending 
 the gardens.                          
    Springfields employ between 20 to  
 100 people depending on the season.   
    Each Spring the floats used in the 
 Flower Parade can be seen here.       </content>
