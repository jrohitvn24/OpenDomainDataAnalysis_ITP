		<title>10Guisborough shops I</title>
		<content> We undertook a survey of shops on the 
 High Street (Westgate). 55 questionn- 
 aires were given out; 25 completed.   
 Most shops are long-established,some  
 for over 30 years. The no.has gone up,
 ditto the no.of customers,as the town 
 has grown.But only 2 shops used       
 computer tech.(Hintons,a large chain  
 store,&amp; a music shop with a mail order
 business) When asked about competition
 from the twice-weekly market (on the  
 cobbles in front of the shops) only 4 
 complained &amp; the others welcomed      
 it.Again, only 2 thought the super-   
 store,Fine Fare, set up a year ago on 
 the town's edge, reduced their tak-   
 ings.Questions on the efficiency of   
 local services brought angry answers  
 &amp; only 3 were happy.Most said a lack  
 of parking spaces stopped shoppers    
 coming to the town centre,&amp; pro-      
 duced congestion.                     </content>
