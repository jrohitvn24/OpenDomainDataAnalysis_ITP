		<content> THE LAND BETWEEN WOOTTON ST. LAWRENCE 
 AND IBWORTH IS PART OF THE HIGH CHALK 
 DOWNLAND OF NORTH HAMPSHIRE,RISING TO 
 A HEIGHT OF OVER 152 METRES.THE LAND  
 IS PREDOMINANTLY ARABLE LAND,GROWING  
 WHEAT AND BARLEY,ALTHOUGH DAIRYING IS 
 ALSO IMPORTANT.ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONLY 
 A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WOODLAND,THE    
 AREA GIVES A WELL-WOODED              
 APPEARANCE,SINCE MANY SMALL COPPICES  
 ARE MAINTAINED FOR HUNTING.CROPS      
 AFFORDING GROUND COVER,SUCH AS        
 ARTICHOKES,ARE OFTEN GROWN AT THE EDGE
 OF THE ARABLE FIELDS.THE SETTLEMENTS  
 ARE MADE UP OF FARMS AND SMALL        
 VILLAGES WHICH APPEAR REMOTE,ALTHOUGH 
 ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE LARGE TOWN  
 OF BASINGSTOKE.
