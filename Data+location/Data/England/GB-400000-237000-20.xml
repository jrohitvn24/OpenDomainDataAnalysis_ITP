		<title>20A WALK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> The dog and I set off for a walk along
 the old railway line which is         
 overgrown with weeds.  We go across   
 one grass field which has just been   
 cut and baled.  The grass in another  
 field is being taken off as turf and  
 will be ploughed and sown with corn.  
 In another meadow there are some cows.
 Wild flowers are abundant -           
 buttercups, daisies and clover.  A    
 short way on we see a huge machine,   
 we've come across the new oil         
 pipeline.  The machine is digging out 
 the trench ready for the pipes which  
 are laid end to end and welded        
 together.  Further on we see a boy    
 fishing on the banks of the River     
 Isbourne.  The traffic on the A435    
 Evesham to Cheltenham road seems far  
 away although it is quite close.
