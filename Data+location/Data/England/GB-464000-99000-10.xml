		<content>   The west wing was built in 1845     
 and the east wing added in 1876, to   
 cope with the growing number of       
 infectious diseases, including scarlet
 fever from which 483 died.            
   A total of{2,450 staff,}of which    
 1,029 are nurses, look after{25,000}  
 'in' patients and{120,000}'out'       
 patients a year. For these they have  
{799 beds.}The hospital has to pay{Â£20}
{million}a year, 75% of which is       
 for salaries; the rest goes towards   
 cleaning materials, telephones, drugs,
 medical and surgical equipment.       
   The smaller east wing has Renal,    
 Isolation, Geriatric and Children's   
 Wards; the west wing has a specialist
