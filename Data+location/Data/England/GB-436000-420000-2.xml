 high ground between two tributaries of
 the river Calder,Ashfield beck in the 
 north and further south Wain Dike     
 Beck.296 people lived here in 1821.In 
 1834 the railway came to Normanton    
 establishing the town as an important 
 railway junction and only stopping    
 point midway between the capital      
 cities of London and Edinburgh.       
 Coal mining had existed for many years
 but in the 1860's this activity       
 increased.The railway and mining      
 activities transformed the rural      
 village into a town.                  
 In(1895 the Normanton Urban)produced  
 the Towns Coat of Arms,which depicts  
 the industries of the                 
 day(Farming,Railway,Coalmining).
