		<title>06Braydon Community Comparison</title>
		<content>  It may be of interest to compare this
 area with that of the nearby Swindon  
 expansion area. If this survey had    
 been written 10 years ago the         
 communities to the South-West of      
 Purton would have been very similar to
 those of Braydon &amp; Greenhill. Because 
 of the rapid expansion planned and    
 developed through Thamesdown Council. 
 Now, the two areas are completely     
 different. The area around Shaw is now
 highly developed with a new network of
 roads, housing and a community        
 building.                             
    The area around Braydon &amp; Greenhill
 has been left untouched by developers.
 At the present time the are no plans  
 for any substantial housing or        
 industial developments.               
    So for the present time these are  
 communities in contrast. In the 21st  
 Century - who knows ?                 </content>
