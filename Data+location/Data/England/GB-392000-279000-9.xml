		<content> We went to Holy  Cross. Then we saw   
 posh cars. We saw some birds and there
 were some old people there. There were
 some{houses.}They were nice because   
 they were big probably with about     
 3 bedrooms and a big living room. The 
 gardens were large and lots of the {  
{houses}had balconies and white spiral 
 staircases. They also had large       
 pathways about 50 yards long. The     
 people we met were nice and seemed to 
 like living there. I wouldn't like to 
 have lived there because there were   
 lots of retired people and very few   
 young people.
