		<content> This farm comprises of 108 acres all  
 down to grass, and supports a family  
 of six.  There is no rough grazing and
 all has been ploughed in the last ten 
 years.  There are herds of 70 cows,100
 ewes (half pedigree Suffolk).  Milk   
 goes to the Torrington Dairy. Over the
 pas 25 years feeding has been all     
 silage with no hay.  Thewre are 2     
 acres of good oak and one acre of     
 rough woodland.  The land is heavy and
 has been drained within the last 15   
 years with a system installed to stop 
 the flow of effluent into the river.  
 Grass is grown with the aid of        
 ammonium nitrate, two units per day   
 during the growing season. It is      
 totally self supporting for water with
 its three wells and gravity feed
