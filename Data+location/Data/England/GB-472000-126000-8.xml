		<title>08SOPHIE C.- A day in the life</title>
		<content> Hello - my name is Sophie Conolly and 
 I'm twelve. I live with my parents and
 two brothers in Cockshott Lane, Frox- 
 -field.A typical Sunday for me starts 
 when I get up and breakfast on the    
 balcony with the family.If it's a fine
 morning,I might stay outside and read 
 or draw. We might lunch outside unless
 it looks like rain.One day I went with
 my brothers for a bike ride in the    
 lanes near our house.On another day we
 went to the Steep Fete.Last Sunday,our
 neighbour Eva Barnsley dropped by with
 some flowers for us,and stayed to tea.
 I did some prep &amp; played cards before 
 supper-spaghetti bolognese and fruit. 
 Afterwards we began a game of Trivial 
 Pursuit.It ended with Peter being sent
 to bed &amp; Jonathan having to get ready 
 to return to boarding school.I watched
 TV for a bit &amp; went to bed at 8.45pm. 
 School tomorrow - ugh!                </content>
