		<title>10Buildings:World's End</title>
		<content> As far as buildings are concerned,    
 there has been little change for a    
 very long time. most cottages are over
 50 years old, some even older. 50     
 years ago  they belonged to workers   
 but now richer people buy these pretty
 cottages to live in:because of the M4 
 they can travel to London quickly.    
    The church at Oare is a very fine  
 village church. Its last restoration  
 was in 1880 when it was cleaned up.   
 The church now attracts hikers and    
 sightseers. Many of the buildings in  
 the area are listed.                  
    There are no hotels or youth       
 hostels. At the moment, in Hampstead  
 Norreys, there is a new village hall  
 being built. This may house Cubs,     
 Scouts and Guides which moved out some
 time ago. To sum it all up, the parish
 is very rural but not growing.
