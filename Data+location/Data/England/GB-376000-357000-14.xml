		<title>14Farming - Dairy Farming</title>
		<content> The block is predominately a dairy    
 farming area. A typical family farm   
  covers about 137 acres. The average  
 herd will be 100 British Freisians.   
 Most farmers breed their own          
 replacement herd of heifers. Some     
 farmers fatten up beast cattle but    
 most sell cross bred calves at 1 month
 old. Cows calve once a year and spend 
 8 weeks dry each year before calving. 
 On average each cow will give 24 ltrs 
 of milk per day. His day starts when  
 he rises at 5:30 to begin milking at  
 6:00. The average working day lasts   
 10.5 hours. The farmer generally does 
 his own vetinary work unless the      
 problem is serious. Half the land is  
 grazing and the other half is used for
 silage with about 2 or 3 cuts taken   
 and put in clamps. The farm is fully  
 mechanised with mowing and milking    
 machines, tractors &amp; forage harvesters</content>
