		<title>09THE VILLAGE HALL-FIRE!!!</title>
		<content>On Saturday 27th April 1985 at Marsh   
Baldon, the Village Hall burnt down.   
There was a bonfire quite near to it   
and the wind had blown some sparks onto
it. First of all the kitchen caught    
fire. Mr.Polly went inside to get out  
the gas bottles as he was scared that  
they might have blown up. Four fire    
crews arrived quickly but nothing could
be done to save the timber building, a 
First World War army hut.              
We could feel the heat on us.The flames
crackled and they were very high too.  
The water-pressure is low in Baldon and
at the School a fire appliance sucked  
water from the pond. The firemen hacked
the fence away, then drained the ditch.
Already people are busy raising money  
to build a new hall. There is to be an 
open meeting in August to decide what  
the villagers want in the way of a     
meeting place;what to do for the best. </content>
