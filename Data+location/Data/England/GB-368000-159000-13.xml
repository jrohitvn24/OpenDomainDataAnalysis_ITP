		<content> Every May day is celebrated with side 
 shows, dancing and various stalls. On 
 Halloween the children dress up as    
 witches/wizards and knock on doors    
 asking for a "trick or treat" . The   
 idea is to get the occupant to give a 
 sweet or goodie. If they refuse, a    
 trick is played on them. On the same  
 evening the Morris men dance round the
 village stopping for the odd beer.    
 The Priston Jubilee Morris men were   
 formed in 1977. Their repertoire of   
 25 dances came from Oxfordshire. A    
 team of Morris men is called a "side" 
 There are 12 members in the Priston   
 side.                                 
 Although Priston does not have a pitch
 it has a cricket club called the      
 Priston Wanderers formed in 1985 it's 
 first season
