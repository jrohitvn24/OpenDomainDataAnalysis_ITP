		<title>06MY HOUSE.</title>
		<content>I live by the fields behind King Edward
VI School in Lichfield. My house is    
very modern and was designed by my Dad.
It has two balconies and three         
bedrooms.It has not always had the two 
balconies, we have had them added on   
recently. We have also had our loft    
converted into a landing and bathroom. 
All the walls upstairs are covered with
pine wood strips and hessian. We have  
got a green spiral staircase which goes
from my playroom (which used to be our 
garage) up to my bedroom and our       
workroom where my Dad keeps his        
drawings, his drawing board, all his   
pens and journals.                     
   Our house is about eighteen years   
old and when it was built it was one of
the most modern houses in Lichfield.
