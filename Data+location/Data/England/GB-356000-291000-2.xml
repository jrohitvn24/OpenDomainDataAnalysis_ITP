		<title>02THE STORY OF HARRIOT MYTTON.</title>
		<content>     {Harriot Mytton}lived at Shipton  
 Hall about the year 1750.    She      
 started writing on the windows when   
 she was twelve.    I think she        
 probably did it with a diamond that   
 was in a ring she got for her         
 birthday.    On one window she wrote  
{P call on April 1743                  
      She fell in love with a boy who  
 lived at{Larden Hall}but her mum and  
 dad would not let her marry him.      
      They locked her up in her room   
 Then she wrote on the window a lot.   
 If you go in that room you can see    
 what she wrote.    In the end she     
 married the boy.     She died when she
 was over eighty years old and is      
 buried in the graveyard of{Shipton    
{Church.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
