		<content> Most of the 16th C.lath and plaster   
 houses in Great Easton are clustered  
 together near the church.The first    
 expansion in the village was when the 
 Maynard estate was built.These are    
 three pairs of red brick cottages     
 built 1840-1860 and one larger house. 
  In the 1950's when farmers were      
 building large dutch barns,it became  
 fashionable to buy up the old barns   
 and convert them into houses.Bridge   
 Foot Barn is an example of this.Others
 bought small cottages to convert into 
 one larger house. The newest houses   
 are built with breeze blocks and      
 bricks.There is one new estate which  
 is a cul-de-sac. Other new  houses are
 built between the older houses.Next to
 the Bell is a house which is only 10  
 years old built in the old style to   
 match the other houses nearby.
