		<content> They had to wear handed down clothes  
 from the rest of the family.          
   In the Summer the people of Moorends
 went on a day trip to Cleethorpes, and
 it was paid for by 'Uncle Arthur', a  
 local shop-keeper.                    
   The children din't have many sweets,
 mostly mints.  Most of the people     
 liked fish and chips and apple pies.  
   There were two policemen in the     
 village that kept law and order. Their
 names were P.C.Bainbridge and 'Bobby' 
 Mills.                                
   The people always shared with each  
 other.  For instance, if a boy wanted 
 a turnip to make a lantern, he'd ask  
 if he could have one and the farmer   
 would tell him to take a couple.      
   The children had no pocket-money.   
 The first time they did have any was  
 when they got a job. Their parents    
 would give them some of their wages.  </content>
