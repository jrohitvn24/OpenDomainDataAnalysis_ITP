		<title>06TRESWELL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> The origin of this village name is    
 derived from 'three wells' that once  
 existed for drinking water. Treswell  
 is a rural village with most of it's  
 houses set along Main Street. In      
 Treswell there is a garage with shop, 
 and a public house. There is an active
 village community. 'Taskers' is a club
 run for young children. We play games,
 make things and have Bible studies. It
 is held in the chapel. There is a     
 ladies' rounders team, a              
 horticultural society and a village   
 committee  which runs a summer        
 gala.Volunteers in the village run a  
 summer club during the school holidays
 and a Christmas party is held for the 
 children and the old folks. Whist     
 drives, bingo and Women's Institute   
 meetings are held in the village hall.
