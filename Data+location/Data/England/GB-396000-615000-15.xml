		<title>15INGRAM SHOW</title>
		<content> An annual event which takes place     
 further down the valley in Ingram is  
 the local show. A major feature of    
 this show is a fell-race which begins 
 on the west side of Brough law near   
 Peggy Bell's Bridge. The course takes 
 the runners up the steepest part of   
 Brough law which is mostly bare scree 
 to begin with (known locally as the   
 glitters), up to the campsite on the  
 top of the hill, to the south side of 
 the campsite and then on down to the  
 second set of toilets near Bulbies    
 Wood. There is a prize for the first  
 person finished and also a cup for the
 first person in the parish to finish.
