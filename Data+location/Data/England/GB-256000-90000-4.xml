		<title>04THE ARMY ON DARTMOOR</title>
		<content> Much of Dartmoor is used for Military 
 training, Okehampton Battle Camp was  
 once a large and busier place than it 
 is today. There is no standing body of
 soldiers, but a succession of visiting
 units of mostly army and marine       
 personnel, come to train in the wild  
 landscape. Such training is said to   
 have been an important factor in the  
 Falklands, where the territory is     
 similar.                              
 It is common to find groups of        
 blackened faces in camouflage roaming 
 about with radios crackling. Sometimes
 the silence of the moor is broken by  
 the drone of helicopters. Firing is   
 only carried out on certain days when 
 civilians are not allowed on the      
 ranges, red flags flying to warn of   
 the danger. See next page for details 
 of firing notices.
