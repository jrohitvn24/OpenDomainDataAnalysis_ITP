		<title>08Interview with Mr.Farmer 2</title>
		<content> The blacksmith shop declined because  
 the tractor took the place of the     
 horse.Although finding new work such  
 as making ornate gates and even a     
 ships boiler, the shop closed when Mr 
 Farmer retired.                       
 The village as a place to grow up in  
 was very different to today.Houses    
 were made of stone.The walls were 1.5 
 m thick and parafin oil lamps gave out
 light.Wood or coal gave out heat and  
 the cooking was done on a range.The   
 church was very important.All children
 went to sunday school.Parents often   
 went to the vicar for advice on       
 important letters and matters.In the  
 village there was one shop,a general  
 store selling suits to provisions.    
 Families made their own entertainment 
 ,finding an instrument or making up   
 dances.Everyone went to bed early and 
 awoke early for another tiring day.   </content>
