		<content> On Saturdays we and some of our       
 friends go to a theatrical school in  
 Middlesbrough run by the{Charlton     
{Brothers.}One of our friends saw an   
 advertisment in the paper which asked 
 for boys between nine and thirteen    
 years.We all decided to go and see    
 what it was like.The first few weeks  
 we were treated as the new kids,but   
 after a while we were accepted into   
 the group.                            
          We did our first performance 
 "Junior Show Time" after five months  
 of training.We did five performances  
 of approximately two and a half hours 
 each.The tickets were eighty pence for
 children and one pound for adults. The
 money paid for the hire of the stage. 
 Any profit goes to the producer.We    
 also had to pay one pound a week for  
 the training.
