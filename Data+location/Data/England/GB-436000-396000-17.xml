		<title>17Harley Fruit Shop</title>
		<content> There are only{two}shops in{Harley}and
 one of them is a{fruit}and{vegetable  
 shop. The shop also sells{lots}of     
 other things as well, like all village
 shops. The shop is owned by{Mr. G.    
{Thompson}and he gave us a very        
 friendly welcome. He told us that he  
 used to work in the{Steel Works}but he
 got made{redundant.}With his          
 redundancy money he bought a cottage  
 in{Harley}which had an{old empty shop 
 attached to it. Then he worked very   
 hard to set up his shop. He has been  
 in the village for about{5 years}now  
 and the shop is doing well. He said   
 that he{loves}living in the village   
 and enjoys the work he is doing now.  
 He told us that the villagers use his 
 shop regularly but sometimes go into  
{Barnsley, Chapletown}or{Sheffield}to  
 do their shopping. He said they don't 
 often go to{Rotherham.                </content>
