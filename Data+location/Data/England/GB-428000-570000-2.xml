		<title>02 EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA.</title>
		<content>A survey of the parents of the school  
children largely taken from council    
rented property showed that most       
employed men were in some form of      
engineering,either mechanical or       
electrial 1.e.25o/o.The second highest 
job was that of a tradesman            
e.g.joiner,plumber,painter or builder. 
The regions main problem is reflected  
in the fact that 15 per cent of the    
survey showed unemployment.Many of     
these have only recently become        
unemployed despite the presence of two 
large industrial estates within the    
area.                                  
Women answering our survey showed that 
the majority of employed women are in  
sevices i.e.shop assistants,clerical   
workers,office cleaners etc.In general 
people travelled 4-5 miles to work.    
                                       
                                       </content>
