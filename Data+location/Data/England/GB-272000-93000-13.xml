		<title>13Local History - Hittisleigh</title>
		<content> On a map dated 1300 the village was   
 shown as Whithornleigh. There is some 
 controversy about the derivation of   
 the name Hittisleigh, meaning either  
 "a Tenant's Pasture", or "Hope", "Joy"
 or "Pleasure" in a clearing in a wood.
 It is in the church that most evidence
 has been preserved and is easily      
 available to see. The church of St    
 Andrew is simple and charming, the    
 nave and chancel dating from 14th     
 century. The north aisle was added    
 c.1500, and has a fern patterned beam 
 along one side. A identically carved  
 beam can be seen in Medlake Farm. The 
 loss of agricultural labourers and    
 tied cottages, and influx of a        
 wealthier population has led to the   
 restoration of cottages and buildings,
 many of which are listed as           
 historically and architecturaly       
 important.                            </content>
