		<title>11TOURISTS AND JOBS</title>
		<content> Tourists bring in a big part of our   
 income; each one is worth about Â£100. 
 Nearly 14,000 people visit the town   
 each summer making about Â£1,400,000.  
 They provide jobs in gift shops etc.  
 but these only last for the season.   
 This is an advantage for the          
 schoolchildren. The people who come   
 are mainly young families and senior  
 citizens. This is because Teignmouth  
 is not exciting enough for the 18-29  
 age group. Teignmouth is not good for 
 night-life because there is a lack of 
 night-clubs and discos.               
   There are not many hotels in        
 Teignmouth, so the tourists stay in   
 small family-run guest houses. Quite a
 lot of people use this as a second    
 holiday. This means that in winter    
 they go abroad and in summer they come
 to Teignmouth. This is another reason 
 why there are only jobs in summer.    </content>
