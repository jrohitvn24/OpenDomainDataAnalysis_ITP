		<title>11RESIDENTIAL SURVEY</title>
		<content> From a residential survey of every    
 fifth house we discovered that the    
 majority of residents are aged over   
 sixty.Very few people are aged between
 nineteen and thirty although there are
 a considerable number of children and 
 teenagers.We think  the numbers of    
 elderly people are probably due to the
 fact that there is little opportunity 
 for employment except in the summer   
 season,so unless people are prepared  
 to travel or are self employed they do
 not move into this area.Another factor
 may be that the sea air is relaxing   
 and beneficial to health for the      
 elderly.Most of the residential homes 
 are detached or semi-detached houses  
 and bungalows with few terraced houses
 or flats.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
