		<content> In common with many other rural areas 
 there aren't many children living in  
 the community. Those that do, have to 
 travel to school by bus or car.       
    There is no school within the block
 and Junior children have to travel to 
 Clunbury School. Those that live      
 further than two miles away are are   
 taken there by bus free of charge. The
 remainder are either taken by car or, 
 if they live on a bus route, are      
 allowed to use the school bus though  
 they have to pay fares.               
    The Secondary school children are  
 taken by bus  to Bishop's Castle High 
 School eight miles away. There is the 
 option of going to Ludlow School but  
 the transport in that case is not     
 free.
