		<content> The 14th century church of{St.        
{Mary's at Lower Hardres}was completely
 rebuilt in 1832. A clock adorns the   
 flint walls and the spire makes a     
 useful landmark. The church of{St.    
{Mary the Virgin at Nackington}was     
 dedicated about 1076. It has flint    
 walls with tower and steeple. In the  
 nave traces of 11th century frescoes  
 can be seen. There is some ancient    
 glass depicting the martyrdom of St   
 Thomas of Canterbury. Both churches   
 are served by the Rector of Petham and
 Waltham. Congregations at weekly ser- 
 vices average 15 at Christmas Mass the
 numbers rise to about 80.{St. Faith's}
{New House Lane,}dedicated in 1954 is  
 also the Community Hall. Part of the  
 living of Thanington services are held
 fortnightly with congregations of     
 about 20. The altar is curtained off  
 when not used as a church.            </content>
