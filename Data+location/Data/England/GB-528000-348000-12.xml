		<content>         Most of the area is farmland  
  We find rabbits,hedgehogs,           
 foxes,fieldmice,plover,               
 pheasants,pigeon, sparrows,moles,     
 ducks and rats. Most of the dykes and 
 drains make a home for Daphnia,       
 midges, larvae,fishes,pikes and eels. 
  Some of the area is grassland        
 where grasshoppers,crickets and       
 snakes live.                          
       The farmers are digging up the  
 hedges which means that we do not see 
 many birds such as the greenfinch     
 ,goldfinch,chafffinch, bullfinch and  
 linnet. Some are very rare because of 
 the chemicals which are put on the    
 land .The birds are affected because  
 the chemicals get into the drains and 
 dykes where they drink and onto the   
 crops which they eat. The shells of   
 the birds eggs are weak because of    
 these chemicals, they break easily.   </content>
