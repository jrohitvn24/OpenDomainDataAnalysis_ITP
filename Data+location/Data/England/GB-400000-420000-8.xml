		<title>08PIG FARM</title>
		<content> THe pig farm opened in 1974 with 5    
 boars and 105 {Landrace Sows}.The     
{Gestation}period rof pigs is 105 days 
 and then they have to be kept for 20  
 weeks before they are ready to sell.  
 The pigs are taken every week in a    
 slatted sided trailer to one of 4     
 slaughter houses.The pigs,grouped by  
 size,are kept in {large pens}holding  
 12-22 pigs.Twice a day the pigs are   
{inspected}to ensure good health .A 100
 tons of feed is used monthly.The      
 pemises are visited often by the {    
{Ministry of Agriculture}.Returns are  
 sent regularly to the Ministry of     
 Agriculture.Many more pork products   
 are eaten today than 10 years ago. The
 future of the pig industry is not     
 guaranteed because there is much      
 competition from the E.E.C. countries.
 Few pigs are exported .
