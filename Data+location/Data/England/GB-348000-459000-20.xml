		<content>The work of compiling the information  
for this area was carried out by the   
children of The Cathedral Primary      
and Moorside Junior schools, Lancaster.
The Cathedral Primary School is a Roman
Catholic Primary school near the city  
centre and has about 160 pupils between
the ages of 5 and 11.The texts marked  
(C) were compiled by a class of Top    
Junior children(aged 10/11)            
Moorside Junior School is a County     
Junior school with about 350 children  
between the ages of 7 and 11. It is    
situated in the Bowerham area of the   
city. The texts marked (M) were        
compiled by some of their Top Junior   
children.                              
The research was carried out and the   
texts drafted during the Summer and    
Autumn of 1985. We have done our best  
to ensure the completeness and accuracy
of the data.                           </content>
