		<title>13BATLERS GREEN FARM</title>
		<content> Anyone may see the dairy cows and pigs
 at Batlers Green Farm. The pigs are in
 a big shed at the back and cows and   
 calves are at the front in stable-like
 pens. There are also 8,000 laying     
 chickens and 1,000 broilers, of which 
 120 are killed every week; their heads
 are cut off and they are hung upside  
 down to be drained before put into the
 plucking machine.                     
 Mr Tom Haworth, who leases the farm   
 from Hertfordshire County Council, is 
 very interested in conservation. He   
 believes that everything including    
 birds and insects were put here for a 
 reason and should not be considered a 
 nuisance. A few years ago he lost 40  
 trees from{Dutch Elm Disease}and has  
 gradually been replacing these with   
 oak, field maple and young saplings.  
 He has also provided shelter for many 
 small creatures by improving hedges.  </content>
