		<title>10FARMING INTERVIEW</title>
		<content>{A farmer living in Yeo Vale.}         
    Owns 400 acres of uninterrupted    
 woods and fields around the house.    
 Field size is 4 - 20 acres. Hillsides 
 are too steep for combining so it is  
 wholly dairy; 20 acres are ploughed up
 each year and returned to grass after 
 a year of Spring barley; this grain is
 sold and the straw used for bedding or
 feeding young stock.  Forty acres of  
 clay hilltop have never been ploughed 
 and are often too dry or wet for      
 grazing.                              
    Keeps l50 Friesian cows, 200       
 heifers and 20 bullocks and full grown
 bulls.  Calving is mainly in Autumn;  
 rears a bull or two each year to sell,
 sometimes to the A.I. Centre.  Calves 
 have their mother's milk the first    
 week, then a substitute.              
    Keeps within milk quota and bought 
 in an additional one.                 </content>
