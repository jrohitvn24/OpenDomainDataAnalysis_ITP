		<title>04"Pick your own" at Elkstone.</title>
		<content> The last few years have seen a great  
 increase in the number of farms which 
 offer their customers a "pick your    
 own" service.                         
 Combend Farm at Elkstone is advertised
 as "Superpick" and offers a range of  
 soft fruit and vegetables, available  
 from late June to September.          
 Strawberries and raspberries are the  
 most popular produce, but picking can 
 take a long time if you are not used  
 to it. "Superpick" therefore provides 
 ready-picked produce which might be   
 cheating, but it doesn't make your    
 back ache. Customers come from        
 Gloucester and Cirencester and to make
 things easier for families the farm   
 even provides a creche for small      
 children.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
