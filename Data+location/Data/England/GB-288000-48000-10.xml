		<content> Another tree was the Tulip tree       
 which had flowers like upside-down    
 Tulips, these were green with a streak
 of orange through the middle. This was
 planted in 1926. A plant called the   
 Dianella had bright blue berries that 
 looked as though they had been painted
 on with a very fine paintbrush because
 they were so shiny and delicate,it was
 difficult to believe they were real   
 berries. They had 3 pools in the      
 garden,one was almost 3m deep opposite
 this pool was a bank that was covered 
 in snowdrops in winter. I think the   
 prettiest flower that I saw must have 
 been the Dogwood which flowers at the 
 top of the branch and is white with   
 a pink centre. A pine tree  called    
 Pineus Radiator was 27m tall,one of   
 the many that sheltered the garden.
