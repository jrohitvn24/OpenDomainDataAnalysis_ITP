 Kerrison who lives at Little Prospect 
 Farmhouse, Monxton.                   
 On Friday I get up at 7:00 o'clock    
 then I get ready for school. I go down
 stairs and have something to eat,     
 normally a bowl of cereal,Rice        
 Krispees and milk. My mummy gets ready
 for W.I. that is, Womens Institute. We
 get in to the car and mummy takes me  
 to school before she goes to the W.I..
 Jacky, my elder sister goes to her    
 school, John Hanson Comprehensive     
 School, after me.                     
 When I have got to school I play for a
 little time. Then I have to get my    
 work out. I do maths most of the      
 morning. On Friday the class has a    
 spelling and maths test. In the       
 afternoon we do anything.             
 At 3.30 p.m. we put our work away and 
 put the chairs up and go home.        </content>
