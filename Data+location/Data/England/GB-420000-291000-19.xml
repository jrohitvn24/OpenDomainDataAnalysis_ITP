		<title>19WHITACRE WATER WORKS</title>
		<content>    The original works which were to   
 supply Birmingham with approx 6000000 
 gallons of water per day, began       
 operating in 1883 when Shustoke       
 Reservoir was completed. In 1904 the  
 Elan Valley Scheme was put into       
 operation to supply Birmingham and    
 Whitacre was put on standby.          
    In 1908 Whitacre Waterworks were   
 used to supply Coventry. Now the      
 water is used for Nuneaton, parts of  
 Atherstone &amp; Bedworth &amp; for about 10% 
 of Coventry's needs.                  
    In 1977 the existing works were    
 completed. Further improvements in    
 output are anticipated by the         
 installation of a new pumping station.
    The sources of water are the River 
 Bourne and the River Blythe. During   
 the 1976 drought the River Cole was   
 used as an additional supply of water.
