		<content>     The information for this area has 
 been put together from several        
 sources.                              
                                       
     Children from St.Peter's First    
 School in Williton, including some of 
 the youngest children, provided some  
 of the pages of text and information  
 on land usage.                        
                                       
     Members of Group X of Danesfield  
 Middle School did some research as    
 part of their homework.               
                                       
     Matthew and Alexander Owen, who   
 live in Yarde, but do not attend      
 either of the contributing schols also
 did some research in their own time.
