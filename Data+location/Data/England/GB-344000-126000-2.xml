		<title>02Recent history of Pitney</title>
		<content> Before the First World War,Pitney was 
 invisible from the main road.The area 
 was a dense forest.During the 1914-18 
  war,the trees were cut down for use  
  in the trenches but even during      
 the Thirties,there was a dense forest 
 still to be seen.More trees were cut  
 down for the Second World War and the 
 Dutch Elm Disease finally destroyed   
 the trees.The main industry was       
 farming,tiny farms,some only of 40    
 acres.It's still a working village,   
 the farms still only employ father and
 son to work them.There were a few     
 council houses built before the war   
 but they have now been sold           
 off.Unfortunately,the new houses are  
 all in the Â£50,000 class and young    
 people cannot afford them.The         
 population is old and getting         
 older.It will eventually become a     
 place where people retire to die.     </content>
