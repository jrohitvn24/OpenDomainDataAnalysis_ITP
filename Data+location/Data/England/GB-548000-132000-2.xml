		<content> We turned right onto the main{road}at 
 Lye Green junction. Large black{refuse
 bins stood outside the houses. There  
 were traffic lights where frost damage
 to the road was being repaired. We    
 passed a private estate called Park   
 Grove. Further on there was a field   
 with horse jumps in it. (Horseriding  
 is a very popular{recreation}in this  
 area.) We turned right into the lane  
 which leads back to our school. In    
 this lane, at the southern edge of our
 area is Cares Garage. In this short   
 drive we had covered at least 75% of  
 the roadway in our area. The eastern  
 half of the{landscape}is almost       
 totally woodland and farmland although
 the Ordnance Survey map shows that    
 originally a Roman road passed through
 the southern part of FIve Acre Wood.
