		<content>{BULLDOG}A good place to play is on a  
 tennis court. The most number of      
 people that can play is 8. One person 
 is "on" and the idea of the game is   
 that the other players have to get    
 from one line of the tennis court to  
 the other without the person who is   
 "on" ticking them with his hand. If   
 the person ticks you then you're "on" 
 as well until the last one gets       
 ticked. Then the game is finished. For
 the next game, if you were ticked     
 first you're on.                      
{KIRBY}You pick a road to play on which
 has a kerb at each side. You need two 
 players and a ball, and the idea of   
 the game is to throw the ball from    
 your kerb to your opponent's kerb. If 
 you hit the kerb you get a point, but 
 if it hits and comes back and you     
 catch it you get two points. If you   
 don't hit the kerb you get no points. </content>
