		<title>15LIFE IN WELLINGBOROUGH TODAY</title>
		<content> Wellingborough offers its people many 
 facilities;a large shopping centre,a  
 transport network comprising bus and  
 rail routes,and different forms of    
 entertainment and leisure.However the 
 citizens share different views on     
 their town.The shopping precinct      
 called the Arndale centre,was built   
 three years ago to meet the demands   
 of an ever increasing population.90%  
 of the shoppers welcomed this but a   
 few thought that it spoilt the image  
 of the town as a market centre.       
 Many commuters think that the         
 transport services are insufficient.  
 There is no proper bus station and the
 railway station is in need of improve_
 ment.Entertainment is provided for    
 both young and old,however,due to the 
 increase in {videos sales}the cinema  
 will be closing down.{Wellingborough  
{thus caters for the young and old}folk</content>
