		<title>10THE SPA AT PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content> In the 19th century was the opening of
 the spa.In the 1850,s the well was    
 owned by Dr.S.C. Sadler who at first  
 filled it in.The villagers were upset 
 by this; they said it had been used   
 for years and cured them when they    
 were ill.Sadler didn't believe        
 them.When he became seriously ill, he 
 tried some himself:he was cured.      
 The well was used for about 200       
 years. In September 1859 a pump room  
 was erected around it.The official    
 opening was a Gala Day.It must have   
 been one of Purton Stoke's busiest    
 days; but by 1880 visitors were no    
 longer allowed. Mr Neville took over  
 in 1927 and tried to revive its       
 trade.He continued to sell bottles by 
 pony and trap.The last entry in the   
 sales ledger was in 1952 when the cost
 of one bottle was 8d.
