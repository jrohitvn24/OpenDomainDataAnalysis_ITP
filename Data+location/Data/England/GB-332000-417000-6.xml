		<content>   Eight children conducted a survey of
 Victorian Houses in our part of the   
 block. The streets we surveyed were   
 Lathom Road, Avondale Road, Leyland   
 Road and Gordon Street. We found that 
 the houses could be divided into four 
 main catagories: a)Guest Houses,      
 b)Nursing Homes, c)Flats (Private or  
 Holiday), d)Private Dwellings. There  
 were 34 Guest Houses, 84 Flats, 12    
 Nursing Homes and 88 Private          
 Dwellings, a total of 218 houses.     
   Many people come to Southport for   
 their holiday and stay in the Guest   
 Houses or Holiday Flats. There are    
 also many Nursing Homes in the town to
 cater for the older people who retire 
 here. Victorian Houses are very large 
 and most suitable for this type of    
 accomodation.                         
   This interesting survey showed us   
 something about our ancestors.        </content>
