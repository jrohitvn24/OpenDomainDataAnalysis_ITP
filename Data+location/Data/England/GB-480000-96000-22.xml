<title>22Beautiful Beach!</title>
<content>

In the witterings we are lucky to have a beach nearby.  The beach has many uses including water sports, dog walking, crabbing and fishing, swimming and also bike riding. &lt;br />&lt;br />Sports that are currently popular at the beach are kayaking, surfing, bodyboarding and kite surfing.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Due to the high tides the sea defences have been improved over the years.  The beach looks completely different to how it did in 1986.  The shingle banks are higher and steeper and in places steps are not needed to access the beach. &lt;br />&lt;br />Everyday fishermen go out to sea from East Wittering.  They bring fish back for the hut and fishmongers.  &lt;br />&lt;br />For safety there is a part time Life Boat Station in Bracklesham and a full time one in Selsey.&lt;br />   &lt;br />
