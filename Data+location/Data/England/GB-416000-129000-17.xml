		<title>17Clarendon Estate, Laverstock</title>
		<content> The Clarendon Estate occupies more    
 than 75% of this  4 by 3  Km. block.  
{There are 5000 acres of land and some 
{14 miles of track road on the Estate  
 which give access for four gamekeepers
 to look after the Estate's interests. 
 Nearly half of the Estate is put to   
 forest, both decidious and coniferous 
 type. Three tenanted farms use 50% of 
 the land for mixed crop farming of    
 Barley, Maize, Oats, Rape, Wheat and  
 Turnip for dairy herds. Over three Km.
 squares the fields are surrounded by  
 regular lines of decidious trees      
 giving a very regimented pattern to   
 the land cover. This does have the    
 effect of providing shelter for the   
 crops from the winter north east winds
 which cut over the area. However the  
 prime reason is to provide for natural
 shelter to the young partridges and   
 pheasants which the Estate breeds.    </content>
