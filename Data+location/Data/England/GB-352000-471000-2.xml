		<title>02JACKDAW QUARRY</title>
		<content> It's more than ten years since        
 limestone was quarried by United      
 Gravel from{Jackdaw Quarry}near Over  
 Kellet but it is still a busy place,  
 especially on hot days.The quarry has 
 filled with water and in the summer   
 it's like a free public swimming pool.
 On warm evenings as many as fifty     
 children will be there.It's good for  
 swimming because it's large and deep- 
 some say{200 feet}deep.The water is   
 reasonably clear and very blue.There  
 are cliffs around the edge and        
 children jump from them into the      
 water.The quarry is also used as a    
 dump,I once saw some divers pull a    
 moterbike from the water and there is 
 someone at school who says her        
 brother's car is at the bottom of the 
 quarry. Police divers and other groups
 use the quarry for training.
