		<content> We sent a questionnaire to all the    
 homes of the children in the school to
 find out more about what people       
 watched on the television and listened
 to on the radio.                      
 TELEVISION                            
 The favourite programmes were sport   
 and Coronation Street.  Dallas and    
 Crossroads were also very popular.    
 Most people spent at least some of    
 their time each day watching the      
 television, and the most popular      
 channels were I.T.V. and B.B.C.1.     
 RADIO                                 
 The most popular radio channel was    
 Radio 1 with 2CR, the local radio, a  
 close second.  Again, most people     
 spent some of their time each day     
 listening to the radio, but tended to 
 do something else at the same time.
