		<title>13St Michaels Church Braintree</title>
		<content>    St. Michael's Church stands at the 
 corner of South Street and High       
 Street. It is the local parish Church.
    It was originally built just after 
 the town moved to the crossroads      
 from its old site by the river.       
    An area of land from the Church    
 burial ground was taken for house     
 building in High Street at the end of 
 the 15th century.                     
    Certain of the pews in the church  
 were held by rich families of the town
 and surrounding areas. It was         
 during this period that much building 
 of ornate figures took place.         
    The modern church gives services on
 a regular basis and these are         
 generally timed to serve the whole    
 community. Throughout the course of a 
 year many people pass through the     
 doors of this beautiful establishment.
