		<title>01BREDON HILL AREA</title>
		<content>   The area covered by this survey is  
 dominated by the South Eastern side of
 the unique Cotswolds outcrop known as 
{Bredon Hill.}Nestling at it's base are
 two villages and three hamlets, which 
 are surveyed elsewhere. Predominately 
 rural, the lower slopes of the hill   
 are under cultivation, whilst the     
 steeper grades offer grazing for sheep
 and cows together with cover for      
 various forms of wildlife including   
 rabbits, badgers, stoats, weasels,    
 foxes, hares and various species of   
 mice. Deer are sometimes seen in the  
 wooded areas. Free food is available  
 in the form of blackberries, crab     
 apples, cob nuts, sloes, elderberries,
 mushrooms and wild strawberries.      
   Numerous springs rise on the hill   
 and some housholders have tapped this 
 source of clear fresh water to their  
 advantage.                            </content>
