		<content> There are three counties included in  
 this area, Cambrideshire in the       
 Western quarter(squares 4,8 &amp; most    
 of 12) Bedfordshire in the north      
 western eighth(squares 1 &amp; half of 2) 
 and the rest being in Hertfordshire.  
 The central third is owned by a single
 landowner. The remaining Hertfordshire
 land is owned by three others and     
 Hertfordshire County Council who rent 
 it to smallholders. These small farms 
 (75 to 100 acres) were intended to be 
 first time farms for young men but due
 to the shortage of farmland most of   
 the tenants are older. There are few  
 farms to rent and buying is well      
 beyond most people's pockets.
