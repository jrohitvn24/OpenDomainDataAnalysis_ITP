		<title>06Communication Swine/Coniston</title>
		<content> The main A165 Hull to Bridlington road
 now by-passes Coniston but until the  
 1960's it formed the village's main   
 street. To get to Swine however, it is
 still necessary to pass through       
 Coniston for about a mile westwards   
 along a little used back road. Swine  
 is a dead end village of 18th and 19th
 century brick houses strung along its 
 single street. It once boasted a      
 railway station serving the two       
 villages and the outlying farms. With 
 the demise of the Hull to Hornsea     
 railway under the Beeching plan the   
 villagers now have to rely on a twice 
 weekly bus service. The rest of this  
 extremely rural area is served only by
 paths, tracks, and minor roads to the 
 low lying farms scattered about the   
 countryside.
