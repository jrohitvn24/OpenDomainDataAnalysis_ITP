		<content> I wake up at about half past nine in  
 the morning.Ma makes some porridge    
 while she has bread with bran on top. 
 We then feed Kermit,our cat.Itake out 
 a couple of chairs into our garden if 
 it is fine.                           
 After elevenses(a cup of tea and a    
 biscuit) I usually go and do a bit of 
 shopping while Ma does a crossword.   
 It is annoying, having to get the car 
 out just to visit the shops but I like
 shopping because I can buy myself a   
 supply of sweets to last a little     
 while.                                
 It annoyed me to see a lot of lovely  
 countryside changed into Open Cast but
 the worst thing about it is they      
 spoilt a lot of lovely walks for the  
 people in our area.
