		<content>   The village of High Ongar is        
 situated just off the A414 between    
 Chelmsford and Harlow.It has a        
 population of 1100.High Ongar was     
 mentioned in the first Doomsday Book. 
 There has been little change since    
 then:it is still mainly a farming     
 community today,as it was back in the 
 eleventh century.The main changes have
 been the building of new housing in,  
 especially the Millfield estate in    
 1948,resulting in a pleasant blend of 
 old and new housing.Industry has also 
 come to High Ongar in a minor         
 way,creating employment opportunities 
 for the local people.Brace's in 1926  
 and LECA in 1964.There are also a     
 small number of industries on a n     
 estate to the south of the village.The
 use of the land has also changed from 
 dairy to arable farming.
