		<title>12Uckfield Bypass, Horsted.</title>
		<content>   A bypass for{Uckfield}was suggested 
 in the 1930's but a route was not     
 approved until 1975. Work started in  
{February 1984.}It is on target for its
 scheduled completion in{May 1986.     
   When finished about 12000 vehicles  
 will use the Bypass each day. At pres-
 ent 5000 vehicles per day use the A26 
 south of Uckfield but two thirds are  
 expected to turn onto the Bypass at   
 the Horsted roundabout. Areas to its  
 north and south have been cut away and
 embankments made. About{65000 square m
 of farmland &amp;{23000 square m}of wood- 
 land have been taken from this area.  
  {Culverts}have been built where the  
 Ridgewood Stream meets the Bypass and 
 the Stream diverted for about 300 m.  
 Retaining the existing channel would  
 have been too costly. Once the Works  
 in the Valley have been left to settle
 the road surface can be laid.         </content>
