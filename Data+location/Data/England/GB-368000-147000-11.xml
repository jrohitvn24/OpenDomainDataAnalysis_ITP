		<title>11The Legion Flats, Coleford</title>
		<content> On the 25th  June we  went to the     
 British Legion Flats  at Douglas Yates
 Court, in Coleford. It was called that
 because a man who opened it was called
 Douglas Yates.  First we had a drink  
 of orange and some crisps then        
 Mrs.Seymour showed us her flat.It has 
 a bathroom, kitchen, and bedsit .     
          They have a choice of colour 
  scheme and she picked pink.          
       Mrs Seymour has got two fridges 
 because the big one makes too much    
 noise and she can't get to sleep. In  
 her bathroom there is a pole to help  
 her get out of the bath.              
    Then we went to see Mrs Jay's chair
 lift, and saw how it worked.   Then it
 started to rain and a man offered us a
 lift back to school in his car.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
