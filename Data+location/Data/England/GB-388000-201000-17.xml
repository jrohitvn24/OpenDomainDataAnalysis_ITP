		<title>17THE ROUNDHOUSE, CHALFORD</title>
		<content>                                       
 The Roundhouse was built in 1789 at   
 the opening of the Thames and Severn  
 Canal.The lock keeper and his family  
 lived there.His job was to look after 
 the lengths,or pounds,of waterway.    
 They also had to operate the lock     
 gates each time a barge passed east or
 west.The Roundhouse is shaped like its
 name and is four storeys high,built   
 from Cotswold stone with a roof of    
 slates in a conical shape.Originally  
 it only had two small rooms.After the 
 First World War it was lived in by a  
 lockeeper,his wife and their ten      
 children. For a short time it was a   
 museum but it is now a private house. 
 The area of the canal in front of the 
 building has been restored recently.It
 is a picturesque reminder of the      
 history of our valley.
