		<content> Before 1963, Cramlington consisted of 
 the old village and a few colliery    
 rows left over from the mining days at
 Nelson Village and Hartford. Then it  
 became a  new Town and has continued  
 to grow ever since. There are many new
 housing estates, both council and     
 private. The private housing ranges   
 from inexpensive link villas to luxury
 detached houses.                      
  The street names in any estate always
 have the same initial letter. This    
 makes it easier to find places.       
  There are footpaths and cycle tracks 
 between the estates, but there are no 
 through roads for cars, so that it is 
 safer for children.                   
  There is a new estate of houses being
 built very close to Burnside First    
 School at the moment.
