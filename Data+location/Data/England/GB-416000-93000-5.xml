		<title>05A walk through the grid IV</title>
		<content>  In the distance to our left we could 
 see the A35 ,the Railway line on its  
 embankment, and Roeshot Hill.         
  As we walked on we came into Housing 
 once again . Bungalows to our left and
 a few shops to our right. These shops 
 were called Saulflands. From the car  
 park in front of the shops we could   
 see the back of our school. To get    
 there we had to continue along        
 Smugglers Lane, then turn left into   
 Forest Way and then take the third    
 left into Parkside.                   
  By the time that we returned the     
 coaches that would take the pupils    
 home were waiting in front of the     
 school car park and there was an ice  
 cream van paked by the main gate.     
  We had walked nearly 4.5 miles and it
 had taken just under 2 hours. The     
 weather was good . The date Wednesday 
 3rd July, 1985.                       </content>
