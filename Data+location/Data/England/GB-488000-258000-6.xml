		<content>THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE      
BY-PASS IS BEING BUILT.HERE ARE SOME OF
THEM:-1.TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF        
ACCIDENTS.2.TO KEEP THE VILLAGE        
CLEANER AND QUIETER.3.TO RE-UNITE      
THE TWO HALVES OF THE VILLAGE, NOW     
DIVIDED BY THE MAIN ROAD.4.LESS WEAR   
AND TEAR OF THE ROADS.5.LESS           
CONGESTION.6.TO GIVE EMPLOYMENT TO THE 
BUILDING INDUSTRY.SOME PEOPLE ARE      
OPPOSED TO THE BY-PASS BECAUSE THE     
COUNTRYSIDE WILL BE SPOILT.ALSO TRADE  
FOR BUSINESSES LIKE THE GARAGE WILL BE 
AFFECTED.IT HAS BEEN AGREED THAT THE   
WESTERN OUTER ROUTE WILL BE            
CONSTRUCTED,AT AN APPROXIMATE LENGTH OF
3.3KM.A BY-PASS IS NOW BEING COMPLETED 
AT THE NEXT VILLAGE OF WOLLASTON AND IT
IS HOPED THAT BOZEAT'S WILL FOLLOW     
SOON.
