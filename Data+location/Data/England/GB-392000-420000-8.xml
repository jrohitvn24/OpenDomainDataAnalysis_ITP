		<title>08Summit Tunnel</title>
		<content>    On the morning of 20th December    
 1984, a train of tanker wagons became 
 derailed in the centre of Summit      
 Tunnel. The petrol caught fire and the
 flames emerging from the ventilation  
 shafts were shown around the world in 
 spectacular television pictures. The  
 repairs to the tunnel took eight      
 months to complete and the tunnel     
 re-opened on 19th August 1985.        
    The northern end of the tunnel,    
 which was built by John Stephenson,   
 emerges in Walsden. It was started in 
 1838 and finished in December, 1840.  
 Some 23 million bricks were used and  
 1000 men employed. When it was opened 
 it was the longest railway tunnel in  
 the world.                            
    It is a great credit to the men who
 built it that, even after such a crash
 as the one above, the tunnel didn't   
 collapse and can still be used today. </content>
