		<content> My name is Claire Brayshaw. I am ten  
 years old and my address is Woodlawn, 
 White Horse Lane, Rhodes Minnis. My   
 Mum is called Shirley Brayshaw she has
 got a horse which she likes riding. My
 Mum goes out in the morning and lets  
 the animals out and puts her horse out
 and cleans the stable. After that my  
 Mum fills up the water buckets and    
 feeds the animals. Mum goes in and    
 makes breakfast. Then she feeds the   
 hedgehogs and after that makes the    
 beds. She puts out the eggs to sell in
 cartons.
