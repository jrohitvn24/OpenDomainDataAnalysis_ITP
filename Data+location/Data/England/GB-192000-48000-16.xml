		<content>  I usually get up at 6.30a.m.and then 
 I get a book and read it for half an  
 hour.Then I play on my computer which 
 is a Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K.        
  My cottage is 107 years old.It looks 
 old on the outside but is modern      
 inside.When I turn on the television  
 set I turn to channel three which is  
 T.S.W - Today South West usually T.V  
 a.m the early morning breakfast show. 
  For breakfast I have fried egg,baked 
 beans,sausage,bacon,fried potatoe and 
 fried bread.After breakfast I have to 
 do the washing up which I don't mind. 
  On Saturdays I go to town which is   
 called Truro.Mum takes me in her Ford 
 Escort.I usually go in Smiths,the     
 library,Tesco and Boots.At 12.30 I buy
 a Cornish pasty which is pastry that  
 is full of potatoe,turnip,onion and   
 pieces of beef.I enjoy watching       
 television in the evening.            </content>
