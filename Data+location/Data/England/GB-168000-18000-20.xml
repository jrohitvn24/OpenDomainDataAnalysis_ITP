		<title>20MULLION SCHOOL SUMMER FAYRE</title>
		<content> On 21st July 1985,Mullion School held 
 a 'Summer Fayre'.This event is        
 organised every other year by the     
 parent/teacher association to raise   
 money for equipment for the school    
 which is not supplied by the Local    
 Education Authority. There was a      
 display by a parachute team, a concert
 by the Cornwall Youth Jazz Orchestra, 
 displays by local gymnastics, dancing 
 and art groups. Each tutor group in   
 Years 1 to 4(16 in all) organised a   
 stall.There was a coconut shy,a       
 ducking stool,stalls for produce,     
 including sea food,cakes,sweets; a    
 'beatthe goalie' competition, raffles 
 and many more. Over Â£2000 was raised  
 to be spent on maintaining the school 
 bus and providing a video camera for  
 the school.Most teachers believe this 
 should be financed by the Education   
 Authority,but funds are limited.      </content>
