<title>22THE WOODSIDE SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
<content>

The supermarket (P&amp;A) was knocked down after standing empty for many years, you can still see its footprint. The public house (the Century) was recently knocked down and for a while you could see fields through the gap.  A large Aldi was built on the site.  The area with raised flower beds and seating was recently replaced with a large carpark and the underpass was filled in. There was an official regeneration.&lt;br />&lt;br />The newsagents expanded and is more of a supermarket now, with a small post office inside.  There is no butchers, green grocers or health centre.  &lt;br />&lt;br />There is a chemists, tool hire centre, hairdressers and the original community centre.   &lt;br />
