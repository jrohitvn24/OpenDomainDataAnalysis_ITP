		<title>02Canvey and the refinery.</title>
		<content> The area we hace surveyed has a large 
 road running through the middle of    
 it,called Northwick Road.It is a quiet
 road that leads to the oil storage    
 tankers.On the left of the road there 
 is a wide spread of grass with a      
 couple of small bushes.Beyond that    
 there are large oil storage tankers.  
 This covers about half of our surveyed
 plot.There are seven large main oil   
 storage tanks and five smaller ones.  
 Amongst these are large chimneys and  
 small generator plants.On the other   
 side of the oil storage tankers is the
{River Thames}this borders {Canvey} on 
 one side.These storage tankers are not
 in use,this is because of an{I.R.A.}  
 bomb in 1977 at the nearby Texaco oil 
 storage company at Stanford-le-Hope.  
 Public outcry prevented the completion
 of this terminal, as they were afraid 
 that they might become a target.      </content>
