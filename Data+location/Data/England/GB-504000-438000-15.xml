		<content> On Saturday the 6th.July,1985         
 sixty-three floats paraded            
 through Beverley streets,because it   
 was the Lions Carnival which has taken
 place for twenty-one years.           
      The Swinemoor Parent teachers    
 Association met in Morton Lane car    
 park along with everyone else for the

{'Bugsy Malone in the Swinemoor        
{Speakeasy'                            
  All the girls wore 1920's style      
 dresses,and the boys wore dark        
 clothing with a large brimmed trilby. 
 The girls were seated at tables       
 with cocktail drinks. Boys had        
 imitation guns and one boy pretended  
 to be dead.                           
      We drove through the historic    
 streets of Beverley;Wednesday
