		<content> This area is split into two very      
 distinct halves by the ancient chalk  
 ridgeway, leading to Corfe Castle in  
 the East.  To the south are the clay  
 soils of the agricultural land around 
{Church Knowle.} Beyond the ridgeway to
 the North is marshy heathland, the    
 centre of a still-thriving clay mining
 industry.  Also crossing is the A351, 
 the very busy road from Wareham that  
 brings the tourists into Corfe Castle 
 and provides the only main road into  
 the seaside resort of Swanage to the  
 south. This road can be a constant    
 stream of traffic in the summer.  Few 
 cars leave the main road to take the  
 twisting roads that pass East Creech  
 and Church Knowle.  The{Blue Pool,    
 near Furzebrook, is, however, a       
 considerable attraction.
