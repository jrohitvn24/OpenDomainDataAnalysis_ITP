		<title>17Views of a Shropshire Vicar</title>
		<content>  The priest-in-charge of this rural   
 community has pastoral responsibility 
 for six churches, including those of  
 Leebotwood, Smethcott and Woolstaston.
  He is concerned that the professional
 status of the clergy has been greatly 
 eroded both financially and socially  
 in recent years.                      
  He is also concerned that the church 
 building is seen by the villagers as  
 not simply a place of worship, but is 
 considered to be the symbol of the    
 village. When money is needed for     
 church repairs other residents as well
 as the congregation, are willing to   
 make contributions in order to        
 preserve their village symbol.        
 However, the clergyman would prefer to
 be seen as the spiritual leader of his
 parishioners rather than the Curator  
 of Historic Monuments.
