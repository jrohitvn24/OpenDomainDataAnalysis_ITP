		<content>    Most children on entering primary  
 school at five years old have attended
 one of the several playschools held   
 around the area. Each of the modern   
 primary schools has approximately 350 
 pupils. At the age of 11 pupils       
 transfer to the much larger Brighton  
 Hill Comprehensive School where a wide
 range of subjects are taught to       
 examination level, usually by         
 specialist teachers.At the age of 16, 
 they will have the opportunity to     
 continue their studies at the         
 Technical College or Sixth Form       
 College in Basingstoke.               
    Many of the facilities of Brighton 
 Hill School are also used in the      
 evenings by the Community Association,
 Sports organizations and the Institute
 of Adult Education.
