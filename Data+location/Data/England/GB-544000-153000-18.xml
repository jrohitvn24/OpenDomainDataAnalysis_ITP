		<title>18QUORNDEN WOOD</title>
		<content> This area of land was used for grazing
 until 1853 and then small timber      
 started to be grown on it. The timber 
 was produced by coppicing which means 
 that the trees were cut off at ground 
 level every few years so that small   
 poles would grow.                     
 Most of the coppice wood was used by  
 the charcoal burners and the main use 
 of the charcoal was to dry out the    
 local hops in the many oast houses    
 around the hill.                      
 Now there is very little demand for   
 beech coppice poles and therefore the 
 coppice have been "singled" leaving   
 one pole to grow into a large tree.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
