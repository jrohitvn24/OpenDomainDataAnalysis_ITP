 One family goes away on holiday       
 whenever they can as they own a       
 business and cannot have proper       
 holidays. Nearly all the people said  
 they were happy with the size of their
 gardens which varied in length. Our   
 final question was about the changes  
 which have taken place over the past  
 20years or so. They all agreed that   
 the village had grown in size, more   
 houses had been built. There is also a
 lot more traffic on the roads,these   
 had also become dangerous. Some       
 interesting places had gone, such as  
 the garden for the blind, and the     
 market garden. But people were pleased
 that the canal had been tidied and the
 walkway made along the old railway    
 line. Everyone agreed it was a        
 pleasant place to live.               </content>
