		<title>01REVIEW : BLOCK 0592 0162</title>
		<content>   The area, which is mainly agricul-  
 tural, is bisected by the A2 road. In-
 cluded within the block are Murston on
 the eastern fringe of Sittingbourne,  
 the village of Bapchild astride the A2
 and Teynham, a larger village lying   
 between the A2 and the London to Dover
 railway which runs parallel to the    
 main road a kilometre to the north.   
 Lower Road is a locally-used alternat-
 ive route between Sittingbourne and   
 Faversham. In Victorian times         
 brickmaking was an important industry 
 in the area but the brickearth has now
 been largely worked out and the former
 brickfields have been replanted with  
 the apple, pear and cherry orchards   
 for which this part of Kent is famous.
 Some arable crops such as potatoes are
 also grown as are soft fruits. Sheep  
 are grazed particularly on lowlying   
 pasture near the Swale.               </content>
