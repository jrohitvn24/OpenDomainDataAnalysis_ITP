		<title>15St. Etheldreda's church (2)</title>
		<content>    The church has three bells which it
 is possible for one person to chime   
 using both hands and one foot.        
    All the windows except one are less
 than 100 years old. A much older but  
 very small one was found which is     
 about 750 years old and it shows      
 St.Etheldreda which is why the church 
 has been rededicated.                 
    In 1979 a restoration appeal was   
 started and well over{Â£20000}has been 
 raised since then and a great deal of 
 work completed. In the summer of 1984 
 work was started on the nave roof and 
 this has now been finished and looks  
 very smart. A lot more work is        
 planned.                              
    The vicar of White Notley is also  
 vicar of the parishes of Faulkbourne  
 and Cressing. He has written several  
 books about the hobby of collecting   
 match box labels.                     </content>
