		<content>   THE FARMER TODAY BEARS NO           
RESEMBLANCE TO HIS COUNTERPART OF FIFTY
YEARS AGO.NOT ONLY DOES HE NEED TO KNOW
ALL ABOUT THE CARE OF HIS ANIMALS,THE  
BREEDING AND REARING OF THE YOUNG,THE  
MILKING,SILAGE MAKING AND THE HAY      
MAKING.HE ALSO NEEDS TO BE A MECHANIC,A
HEALTH AND SAFTY EXPERT,A CHEMIST,AN   
ACOUNTANT AND A PERSON WHO CAN DEAL    
WITH THE VARIOUS INSPECTORS WHO MIGHT  
CALL.                                  
   THE SMALL FARMER,WITH MAYBE FIFTY   
ACRES OF LAND IS RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING  
TO BE REPLACED BY THE BIG FARMER.      
   THE FARMERS WIFE MAY OCCASIONALLY   
HAVE TIME TO TURN THE SULPHUS MILK INTO
CREAM OR INTO CHEESE BUT THIS IS FOR   
HOME USE AND NOT FOR SALE.SHE NEEDS TO 
LOOK AFTER THE HOME AND FAMILY AS EVER 
BUT ALSO SHE HAS TO DRIVE THE CHILDREN 
TO SCHOOL,DRIVE TO TOWN AND SHOP AND   
ASSIST WITH THE MANY OFFICIAL FORMS.   </content>
