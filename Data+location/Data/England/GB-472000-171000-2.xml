		<title>02SCHOOL CLOSURES-EAST READING</title>
		<content>   Two Secondary schools on the        
 Wokingham Rd are closing. The closure 
 decision was finally made in 1983/4.  
 They are closing (July 1986), due to  
 lack of pupils in Reading. There used 
 to be around 1000 pupils in each and  
 they are now down to 200 each. In the 
 last year of school the numbers will  
 drop to 70-80 pupils in each.         
   The schools belong to the Council.  
 Reading College of Technology wish to 
 take over the buildings. The equipment
 will be sent to other schools, some   
 will be taken by teachers to use in   
 their new schools. Many teachers will 
 stay until 1986.                      
   The children will be transferred to 
 other schools at 4th form and 6th form
 levels. The council will pay a grant  
 to the pupils for school uniforms.    
 Those who live far away will be given 
 free bus passes.                      </content>
