		<title>19Transport to work</title>
		<content>Three quarters of the working people we
spoke to did not work in Bugbrooke.As  
so many work outside Bugbrooke they    
need to use transport to get to work.  
                                       
Car or van               184           
Walking                   27           
Bus                       22           
Motorcycle                12           
Bicycle                    8           
Train                      5           
                                       
Those who used the train had to get to 
the station by car or bus.Northampton  
was the station used by all the people 
we spoke to.                           
                                       
In 152 households we found 343 people  
over 17 years old and 195 cars.This    
means that there is 1 car for each 1.75
people who are  eligible to drive.
