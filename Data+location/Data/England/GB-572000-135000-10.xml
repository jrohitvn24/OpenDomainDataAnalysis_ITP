		<content>This old forge is still being used as a
Blacksmiths &amp; Farriers by Clive Stearn 
and Philip Dunwall with a boy          
apprentice. They have worked here for  
the last fifteen years. Most of the    
horses are visited on the farms monthly
to have the shoes fitted but shoes are 
made in the forge using the time-      
honoured method with the furness. This 
forge was the last to shoe oxen. The   
only way to keep the oxen quiet was to 
'throw' them on to their backs while   
attending to their shoes. Fire baskets 
and handles are the other craft work   
undertaken by the blacksmiths. The area
they cover for their work includes     
Smarden, Hawkhurst, Wadhurst &amp;         
Headcorn. The firm is a family one     
originating from Yalding. They spend   
one and a half days a week working in  
the forge.
