		<title>20LIVING IN GROVEHILL, HEMEL</title>
		<content>                                       
   The bad thing about Grovehill is the
 shops. There is glass all over the    
 pavement because teenagers smash      
 bottles. There are a lot of sweet     
 papers around because children just   
 throw them on the ground.             
   The nice thing is that many friends 
 live here. There are lots of exciting 
 things to do, especially at the       
 playing fields and the BMX track.     
 Children also go to Brownies, Cubs,   
 Ballet, Dancing and Karate.
