		<title>07The "balloon stone".</title>
		<content> At the corner of Huggins Lane and     
 Parsonage Lane there is a small, squat
 granite stone etched with the         
 following inscription:                
{NEAR THIS SPOT AT 3.30 IN THE         
{AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 15th 1784,     
{VINCENZO LUNARDI MADE HIS 1st LANDING 
{WHILST ON HIS PIONEER FLIGHT IN THE   
{ENGLISH ATMOSPHERE.                   
{HAVING HANDED OUT A CAT AND A DOG, THE
{PARTNERS OF HIS FLIGHT FROM LONDON, HE
{RE-ASCENDED AND CONTINUED NORTH       
{EASTWARD.}                            
 This was the first aerial voyage in   
 England.The "balloon stone"was only   
 erected in the last twenty years-but  
 is it in the right place? Detailed    
 investigation of eye-witness accounts 
 fix the landing at a point over three 
 miles south east,near the boundary of 
 the Hatfield and Northaw Parishes.
