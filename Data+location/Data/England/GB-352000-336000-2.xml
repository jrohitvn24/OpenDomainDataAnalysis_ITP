 Most of the housing development lies  
 to the northern side of the road from 
 Tilstock to Prees Heath where 30      
 council houses stand, there has also  
 been in 1984 a new housing development
  to the south side of the road. There 
 is also an old footpath leading from  
 the school field straight over to the 
 south west corner of Brown moss. This 
 goes over the fields down and up over 
 the Railway by means of steps and then
 crosses the A41 by the car sales and  
 then up the hill to Brown moss.
