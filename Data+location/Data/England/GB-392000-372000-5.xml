		<title>05UPLAND SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content> This upland area,approximately three  
 miles east north east of Macclesfield 
 is comprised of enclosed rough grazing
 land and has been associated with     
 sheep farming for at least three      
 hundred years.The four farms situated 
 in this area were all primarily       
 concerned with sheep farming but only 
 Horden Farm now continues this,the    
 other farms having been purchased by  
 local people for use as private       
 dwellings.                            
 Horden Farm,comprising approximately  
 three acres at present also produces a
 small range of pottery goods to be    
 sold wholesale to shops,galleries and 
 exibitions.                           
 The track running south from Horden Fm
 to the Setter Dog Public House was    
 originally the Northwhich to Yorkshire
 salt trail used by the Romans but is  
 now a public right of way.            </content>
