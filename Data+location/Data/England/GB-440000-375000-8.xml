		<title>08Our Farm Visit</title>
		<content> Five children went on a farm visit.We 
 went into the farm house.It is three  
 hundred years old.The fire place was  
 huge.Then we went to look at the cows 
 and calves,one of the calves was newly
 born.The calves liked to suck your    
 finger and it sucked mine in and      
 nearly swallowed it.We saw some cows  
 that were ready to go to market.They  
 have very rough tongues and one of    
 them chewed my hair because it thought
 it was hay.We saw a huge,lazy,fat bull
 called Billy.All the chickens were    
 very dusty and made funny noises.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
