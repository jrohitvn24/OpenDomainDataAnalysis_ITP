		<title>11       VOLUNTARY SERVICES ii</title>
		<content>  We interviewed Mrs A.Cameron, the    
 organiser of voluntary services at    
 Barnes Hospital. This is a geriatric  
 hospital of 60 beds, built around 1900
 as a fever hospital. Mrs Cameron      
 recruits, trains and supervises about 
 40 volunteers. There are 3 wards - 1  
 for long-stay patients, 2 for ill     
 over-65s who can hope to return to the
 community (there are well-equipped    
 occupational and physio-therapy       
 depts.) The volunteers cheer up a     
 place already improved by the greater 
 understanding of the needs of old     
 people. They run a weekly tea-bar,    
 hold bingo sessions, sing-songs and   
 ambulance outings. One runs           
 "reminiscence" afternoons. The League 
 of Friends raises money for non-NHS   
 luxuries - an electric typewriter, a  
 raised garden. In addition to the 60  
 beds, there is a Day Hospital.        </content>
