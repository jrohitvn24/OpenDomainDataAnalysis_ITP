		<content> We think{Birstall}is a clean and well 
 looked after place, it is a nice,     
 quiet village which we enjoy living in
 very much.The paths around the        
 market place have been built again and
 new shops have been opened.  Birstall 
 is a busy and fairly noisy place on   
 Thursdays when it is Market Day.      
 Sometimes people write Graffiti on    
 walls. We think that is the only thing
 that spoils Birstall.In Birstall      
 there are about 47 shops.The Market   
 Place has been used for different     
 things including Public Parking, Taxi 
 Parking, and Market.On Bradford Road  
 there are many mills. In Birstall     
 there is one Library which stands on  
 the top of a Community Centre.There   
 are also 3 Primary Schools in         
 Birstall, Birstall County J.&amp;I.,      
 St.Peter'S JMI&amp;N and St Patrick's     
 JMI&amp;N.                                </content>
