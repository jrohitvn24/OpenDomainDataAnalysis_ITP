		<title>07METHODIST CHAPEL.</title>
		<content>   The Methodist{CHAPEL}was opened     
 in 1894 to spread the Gospel  and     
 still does so today. The small number 
 of members are very loyal. The        
 combined{SUNDAY SCHOOL}has over       
 twenty children who are keen to       
 compete with other Sunday Schools in  
 the Thetford circuit for the Annual   
 Youth Festival and there is a Sunday  
 SchooL{ANNIVERSARY}each year. Each    
 week there is a joint bible study     
 evening with Hopton, usually taken by 
 the Thetford Minister. Sunday services
 are usually taken by local preachers, 
 the Minister visiting about once a    
 month. There are very good relations  
 with the Parish Church with regular,  
{COMBINED SERVICES.}The Anglican Church
 also uses the Methodist schoolroom for
 a weekly choir practice. Social       
 occasions such as coffee mornings are 
 well supported by the village people. </content>
