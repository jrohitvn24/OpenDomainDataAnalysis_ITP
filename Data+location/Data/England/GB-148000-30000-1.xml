		<title>01GAZETTEER - GULVAL MARAZION</title>
		<content> The area is a very varied one. It     
 includes part of the small village    
 of{Gulval}and part of the larger      
 village of{Marazion}with its seaside  
 atmosphere. Between the two is the    
 residential area of{Long Rock.}       
{Marazion Marsh}is a small wetland area
 important for bird life.              
                                       
 The south facing slopes overlooking   
{Mount's Bay}are well known for their  
 fertile soil and sheltered aspect and 
 have been farmed at least since       
 the Iron Age. A small vineyard has    
 been started recently.                
                                       
  The sandy beach which runs from      
{Eastern Green}to Marazion attracts    
 holiday makers, and there are chalets 
 and a large caravan and camping site. 
 There is a small industrial site and a
 heliport alongside the A30 trunk road.</content>
