		<content>On June the 17th we moved to Tetsworth 
from Abingdon. We all got up early and 
Dad wasn't very pleased. I had to make 
some tea for the removal men. My       
friend's mum gave us a lolly. I helped 
the men remove some things. I had a    
sandwich with my brothers and then I   
took them to the park and bought them  
some sweets. When the van was full we  
all said goodbye and I cried. We drove 
off. We went on the motorway. When we  
arrived my dad dropped a hammer on his 
toe and we all laughed. I met Alex and 
she showed me the Green. I went to the 
shop with my brother and we bought some
sweets. Our road is narrow and the     
removal van got stuck turning round. I 
tripped over a bump in our new garden ,
I didn't know the bump was there. I    
liked it best in Abingdon.
