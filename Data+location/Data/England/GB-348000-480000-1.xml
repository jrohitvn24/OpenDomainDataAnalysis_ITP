 Milnthorpe population 2000,the largest

 a Friday market in the square and acts
 as a major shopping centre for the    
 surrounding villages.It also has      
 Dallam School which is the secondary  
 school for the area.The area is an    
 undulating lowland which is drained by
 the River Bela.It has mainly limestone
 rocks with large areas of boulder     
 clay.Most of the hills are drumlins   
 which have been formed in the past by 
 ice movement from the Lake District.
