		<title>08The Hamilton Local Plan  2</title>
		<content> Although a plan of the proposed       
 Hamilton development was not          
 officially published, it received     
 publicity in the{Leicester Mercury}and
 other local newpapers. There were     
 major objections to the plan. The     
 objections were well researched and   
 concentrated on questioning the need  
 for a large development in Leicester. 
 In 1976 Leicestershire County Council 
 produced a new, scaled-down plan, yet 
 more objections were voiced which     
 resulted in another look at the plan  
 by the council. It was decided that   
 the development plan should be frozen 
 until the planning officer felt that  
 it was vital to go ahead. In January  
 1983 he made an announcement that     
 Hamilton was now necessary. The plan  
 was formally published in January     
 1983.
