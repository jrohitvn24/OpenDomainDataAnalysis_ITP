		<content> There are five churches in use in the 
 area; two are non-conformist chapels  
 at Christian Malford and Kington      
 Langley; the third is on the Draycot  
 estate; and those at Christian Malford
 and Sutton Benger are two of the three
 Church of England churches for which  
 the Rev. Lord Milverton is Rector.    
 There is also a disused chapel at     
 Draycot Cerne.                        
 The medieval church in Sutton Benger  
 has a 13th century carving of the old 
 pagan god "the Green Man", which is   
 one of the finest prominent examples  
 in English Church Architecture. There 
 is also a sample of medieval          
 embroidery there.                     
 The Green Man is being used as the    
 emblem for the Church Roof Fund,      
 launched in 1985 to raise Â£50,000 for 
 roof repairs. Repairs were last       
 carried out in 1849.                  </content>
