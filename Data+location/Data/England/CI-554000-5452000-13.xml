		<title>13THE LOBSTER POT</title>
		<content> The Lobster Pot is found at L'Etacq.  
 It is a well known local hotel which  
 has built up a reputation for having a
 first class restaurant.               
                                       
 Very good quality meals are always    
 available and the seafood dishes are a
 must.                                 
                                       
 In 1985 this hotel announced that it  
 had had the latest luxury fittings    
 included in its modernisation of the  
 guest rooms at the hotel.             
                                       
 Each room has a private bathroom,     
 telephone, television, tea/coffee     
 facilities and refrigerator.          
                                       
 Besides all of this luxury most of the
 rooms have a view over one of the most
 attractive bays in Europe if not the  
 World.                                </content>
