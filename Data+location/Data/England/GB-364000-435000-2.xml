		<content>We asked 35 children how they spent    
their leisure.The most popular ones    
were T.V.-28.Going to the Rec.-21.     
Shopping-22.Looking after pets-23.     
Visiting-25.Quite a lot of people go to
the Rec.The Recreation grounds have a  
slide,a witches hat,some swings.There  
is a playingfield for football and     
cricket.Every Saturday we have a       
football match on the playing field,and
at the back there is a tennis court.You
can go on the Rec. at any time and     
play. You are not allowed to have      
bikes and   horses on the Rec.The Rec. 
has a few benches around the side.The  
playing field is used for Field Day as 
well then  have a lot of races for     
all ages,and exhibitions.Also the      
school uses it for games.
