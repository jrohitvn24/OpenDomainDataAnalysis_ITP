		<title>03 SWINNEY ENGINEERING LTD.</title>
		<content>   In 1866 the{Swinney Brothers}from   
 Berwick took over the old Tanners'    
 Yard in the centre of Morpeth for an  
 iron foundry, turning out in the early
 days anything the area required.{     
{Chantry (1869) and Skinnery (1904)    
{bridges}were built by{Swinney's}and as
 the firm grew it extended into more   
 specialized work for the{SHIPBUILDING}
 industry.At the present time Swinney's
 are specialists in the design and     
 manufacture of Filtration and         
 Separation equipment for{OIL, GAS}and{
{CHEMICAL}installations. The existing  
 site no longer allows for expansion so
 Swinney's,still a family firm,will    
 move in the near future to Ashington  
 taking with them the existing work    
 force and also employing extra labour.
 The vacated site will be used for a   
 supermarket and car park giving new   
 employment and bringing trade.        </content>
