		<content> Scalford Bakery is a small family     
 business, started by George Allen in  
 1902, and passed on to each generation
 since. Now it is owned and run by two 
 brothers, Charles Ernest and George   
 Edward Allen.Charles' son Charles     
 Anthony also works in the business,   
 and George's wife Margery owns the    
 bakery shop where some of the bread is
 sold.                                 
      The Allens sell the rest of the  
 bread by driving around the area up to
 a distance of 13km to the NE.On this  
 run, deliveries include bread to      
 Belvoir Castle for the Duke of        
 Rutland.                              
      Types of bread baked are brown,  
 white,granary, bloomers, tin loaves,  
 steam loaves, and bread buns, as well 
 as pork pies, cakes, biscuits and     
 scones.
