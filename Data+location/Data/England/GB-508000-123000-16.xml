		<content> This area is traditionally loyal to   
{Conservative}party politics. The      
 old-style Tories tended to be         
 paternalistic, encouraging self-help  
 in the community rather than          
 dependence on hand-outs from the rates
 and they provided little to match the 
 spending of other areas on bus passes 
 for the old, good pupil-teacher ratios
 etc. The newer Tory adminstrations    
 have cut back further on provisions   
 and are finding their grip challenged 
 by an alliance of{Liberal}&amp;{Social    
{Democrats}whose showing in recent     
 local elections (where education cuts 
 were an issue) was good but not       
 spectacular. The Tory MP who has      
 represented the district for a long   
 time has a comfortable majority. There
 is a core of{Labour}party workers and 
 voters who also espouse nuclear       
 disarmament.                          </content>
