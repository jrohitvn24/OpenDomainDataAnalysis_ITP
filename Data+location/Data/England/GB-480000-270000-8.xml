		<content>In our school we have 5 classes.There  
are 128 children aged 4-11.            
  The main block was built in 1910.It  
is built of red brick and it has 3     
classrooms,the junior toilets, the     
hall,the office, the staffroom,a small 
library and a wet area (for art).      
  The infant block was not built until 
after World War 2.That is made of brick
and is covered in plaster,it is painted
yellow.The infant block holds 2        
classrooms and the infant toilets.     
  We also have a wildlife area for all 
sorts of insects.                      
  Our swimming pool is built on the    
school grounds and is usually used by  
the pupils.The pool is 1 metre deep and
is covered with a plastic dome.        
  Pupils come from the villages of Old,
Hannington, Holcot and Walgrave. 1985  
is the 75th anniversary of the school.
