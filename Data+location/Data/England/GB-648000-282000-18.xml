		<title>18Girl Guides and Cubs</title>
		<content> Girl Guides is a Friday night activity
 for girls. Before you can be enrolled 
 you have to do 8 challenges. We are   
 grouped into patrols. Their names are 
 Swallows, Kingfishers and             
 nightingales.                         
   The guides meet at Southwold. The   
 leader is Miss Mary. Everyone is very 
 nice.                   Clare Trayler 
                                       
 I like cubs because we go outside for 
 searches. We have a shield for the six
 with the most points. You get points  
 for being good and having clean hands.
 We only started two weeks ago and the 
 yellow six won both times. One of my  
 friends, Glen Mitchell, is seconder of
 the yellow six and I am sixer of the  
 brown six.
