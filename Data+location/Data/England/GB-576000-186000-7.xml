		<title>07Employment in Sth Benfleet.</title>
		<content> Until the coming of the railway in    
 1856 Benfleet was an agricultural,    
 rural community.Occupations were based
 on farming and fishing.Traditional    
 occupations remain:sails are made,and 
 so is tarpaulin.Many small clothing   
 factories supply the 'rag trade'of    
 London.To the north of Thundersley is 
 a large purpose-built trading         
 estate.Here are light engineering     
 works and warehouses.A major employer 
 Standard Telephones and Cables is due 
 to close during 1986,but unemployment 
 is fairly low.Few of the Benfleet     
 residents work here.London and        
 Southend provide office jobs. Others  
 work in Basildon New Town and its     
 associated industrial estates,        
 especially the Ford Tractor Plant.    
 Tilbury Docks and associated industry 
 are another source of employment.Many 
 people use their  cars to go to work. </content>
