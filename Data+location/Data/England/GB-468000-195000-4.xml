		<content>There is very little new housing in our
area because planning permission is    
hard to get.                           
The older houses and cottages are built
with flint from the Chilterns. Some of 
them were owned by the University (some
still are). The newer houses are made  
of brick.                              
Most houses are privately owned except 
in Lewknor where Barley Close and      
Weston Road belong to the council.     
There are no flats or high rise        
buildings.                             
We do have a castle, though, and two Ma
ors (Pyrton House and The Manor,       
Lewknor), and eight farmhouses.
