		<content> History of Flitwick Mill              
                                       
 The Mill at Flitwick is one of 6 which
 lay on the River Flit. There are      
 records of a Mill on this site since  
 the 1085 Domesday. It was originally  
 built by the Monks of Dunstable       
 Priory. They built an artificial      
 channel deeper and wider than the main
 course of the river to augment its    
 speed and power.                      
 In 1711 John Goodman rented the Mill  
 and his son Richard bought the Mill in
 1731. It is still in the possession of
 the Goodman family. The house was     
 altered during thee early 19th and    
 20th centuries and one wall contains  
 the date 1822.
