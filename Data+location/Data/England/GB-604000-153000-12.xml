		<title>12CHILHAM CASTLE-THE KEEP</title>
		<content> Chilham Castle consists of two main   
 buildings, the house and the Norman   
 keep.The foundations of the Castle are
 Roman and Saxon.The Keep has four main
 floors.The first one is the basement, 
 which is wrongly called the           
 dungeon.The basement was used for     
 storing food and weapons in case of a 
 seige.They did not need to store      
 water because there is a well in the  
 keep which is one hundred feet deep.  
 The water was pulled up by two        
 donkeys.The second room is the Great  
 Hall which was where the feasts were  
 held.There is the solar where the     
 constable lived and last is the state 
 room where meetings were held.The     
 house where the owner of the castle   
 lives was built in 1616 and is not    
 open to the public.
