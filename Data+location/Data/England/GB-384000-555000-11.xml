		<title>11EMPLOYMENT SURVEY</title>
		<content> We carried out a survey involving     
 occupations of the parents in our     
 school and we placed them into three  
 categories.                           
{Primary Occupations}- such as farming,
 mining etc. We found that this        
 category is not very important with a 
 total of{43}out of 265 jobs recorded. 
{Secondary Occupations}- such as       
 manufacturing industries we found this
 is quite important in our region. This
 has a total of{74 jobs recorded.      
{Tertiary Occupations}- such as        
 banking, shopkeeping and transport. We
 found out that this is the most       
 important category in our region and  
{154 people came into this group.}     
 We were surprised that there were not 
 more people in the Primary category   
 since this is a mainly farming        
 area.However this shows fewer people
