		<title>16CRAIG'S DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school day begins at 9.00 a.m.but 
 usually we arrive at school about 15  
 minutes earlier to play football or   
 cricket in the playground. When the   
 bell rings we go into school and the  
 first thing that is done is that the  
 register is marked to see who is      
 absent and who is staying for dinner  
 at school.                            
 We have assembly in the hall until    
 about half past nine and then we go   
 into the classroom to do our work. We 
 usually start off with Maths. We have 
 playtime at 10.35 until 10.50 a.m.    
 then we work again in the classroom.  
 We do other subjects like English,    
 History,Geography, Science,Music,Art  
 P.E. Religious Education, Music and   
 Games.                                
 We have dinner between 12.00 and      
 1.15p.m and go home at 3.45 p.m.but   
 the infants leave half an hour earlier</content>
