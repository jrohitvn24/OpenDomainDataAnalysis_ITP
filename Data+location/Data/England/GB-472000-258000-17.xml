		<title>17SHARON'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content>It's Sunday morning and I get up at 6.5
0.I climb out of my bunk-bed and dress 
in warm clothes against the early morn-
ing chill.For breakfast I have Weetabix
and a cup of coffee.Next I go to the   
paper shop to collect the papers and   
deliver them.I go home afterwards and  
watch TVAM or play on my computer until
Mum and Dad get up at about 9.30,then  
well do the housework.Mum or Dad then  
get the dinner ready.We usually have   
meat,vegetables,potatoes and gravy.We  
may go to the club for a drink and then
return home for our meal.My sister and 
I do the washing-up.In the afternoon we
rest and sometimes do the gardening dep
ending on the weather.At about 6.30 we 
have our tea of salad or sandwiches.   
Then after 7.00 I have a bath ready for
school,and the rest of the family have 
their baths.By this time we are all    
settled in front of the TV till bedtime</content>
