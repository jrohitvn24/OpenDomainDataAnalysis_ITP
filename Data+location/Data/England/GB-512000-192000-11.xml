		<title>11FAMILY FUN DAY,SACRED HEART</title>
		<content> Family Fun Day run by the St.Vincent  
 de Paul Society was a great success.  
{ There were 21 events .Besides the    
{usual sprinting,egg'n'spoon,3-legged, 
{wheel barrow,and sack race,there were 
  5 unusual events- Tossing The Sheaf, 
 Black Pudding Throwing, Pea-pushing,  
 Weight-throwing and The Greasy Pole.  
{  Tossing the sheaf attracted alot of 
{attention.This event was won with a   
{vertical throw of 8 foot 6 inches.  } 
 In the Black Pudding event everyone   
 had a great laugh,when the pan handle 
 broke and the pudding disintegrated!  
{ For The Greasy Pole, a telegraph pole
{was greased and Â£10 prize was put on  
{top. No one succeeded until someone   
{had an idea! Why not stand on some-   
{ones shoulders!}He did -and shared the
 prize with his 3 grateful helpers!    
                                       
                                       </content>
