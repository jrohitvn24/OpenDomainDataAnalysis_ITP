		<title>08The Church in Earls Croome.</title>
		<content> St. Nicholas{anglican church}in Earls 
 Croome was built in the 12th century. 
 Most of it is the original work. The  
 tower gallery and vestry were added in
 1832. There is a memorial to four     
 local men who died in the 1914 war.   
    The candelabra are believed to be a
 gift from Worcester Cathedral.        
    Since the last resident rector     
 retired the church has been served    
 from Ripple. There is a thriving      
{Womens Institute}in the village and   
 the only{Mothers Union}in the diocese 
 since the early years of the church   
 times have changed, now all           
 denominations worship and enjoy social
 occasions together.{Womens World Day  
{of Prayer}services are celebrated in  
 alternate years in the three churches 
 of the Parish.
