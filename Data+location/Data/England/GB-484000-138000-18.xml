 Before 1066 Churt was a settlement    
 which was part of the Hundred of      
 Farnham,the manor of the Bishop of    
 Winchester.Domesday Book tells that   
 people had to pay rent to the Bishop  
 at Lawday House in Blackheathfield,   
 where they came twice a year with     
 pigs,cows,geese,hens,grain,straw,hay, 
 eggs,cheese,honey,horse shoes,bows,   
 arrows.                               
 The name Churt is Saxon ,meaning      
 "wasteland".People worked hard for    
 very little.Later they specialised in 
 crafts,buying and selling goods.In the
 Middle Ages people took their goods to
 the yearly fair at Farnham.

 Minister,bought ,and lived in,a large 
 house in Churt.The Pride of the Valley
 hotel is named after him.In the1939-45
