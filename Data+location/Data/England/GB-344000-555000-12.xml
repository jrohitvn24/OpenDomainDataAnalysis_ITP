		<title>12LANDSCAPE OF WARWICK BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    The area is mainly countryside. The
 river Eden winds its way through the  
 fields, if you can afford it there is 
 good salmon fishing.                  
     Round here the land is kept very  
 well.You would find mixed woodland    
 round here.In the villages you would  
 find a few small shops. There is      
 also a golf course.                   
     There is a main road. It is the   
 A69.In some of the fields there is a  
 plant called Oilseed rape which has a 
 yellow flower.In other fields there is
 barley and turnips.The areas animals  
 seem to be contented. You would find  
 lots of little country lanes, old     
 farmhouses, pasture fields, small     
 estates of houses built in the last   
 fifty years or so and peace and       
 quiet....if you like that sort of     
 thing.
