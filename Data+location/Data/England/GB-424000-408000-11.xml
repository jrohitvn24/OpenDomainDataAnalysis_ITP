		<content>   The day I have chosen is Friday. At 
 7.30am my mum and dad get up. My dad  
 takes the dog for a walk. I get up at 
 7.50am and my sister gets up at       
 8.00am. My mum gets my breakfast and  
 sandwiches ready. My  dad has a quick 
 breakfast and goes to play golf with  
 his friend.                           
   I set off for the bus at 8.20am. My 
 sister walks up to the little school  
 at 8.45am. My mum cleans the house.   
   At dinner-time ....                 
 My mum has a snack.                   
 My dad has a sandwich at the pub with 
 his golf friends.                     
 I have sandwiches and so does our     
 Kate.                                 
   My dad comes back for his work and  
 then at 4.00pm I come home. Kate has  
 been home since 3.30pm. Kate, mum and 
 I have our tea around 5.00pm.
