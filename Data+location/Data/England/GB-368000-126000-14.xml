		<title>14GETTING AWAY FROM WINCANTON</title>
		<content> >>>{THIS IS THE AGE OF THE TRAIN ?}>>>
  In fact the Wincanton section of the 
 old Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway closed  
 in 1966, when I was born.             
  Hi folks of the future! My name is   
{Stephen Fred P Ryley,}I am 19. I have 
 found the lack of public transport    
{jolly inconvenient.                   
  Here's a f'rinstance: the nearest    
 train station is in Castle Cary,seven 
 miles away, so you need your own      
 transport to use the public transport!
 To get to Taunton,the train first     
 takes you in the{wrong direction      
 for a \ hour.                         
  I went to secondary school in Bruton 
 5 miles away, for 7 years. I spent{39 
 days on the bus,and{two months}waiting
 for it! You people of the future, you 
 have got it dead cushy compared with  
 me. You don't know you're born...     
     ...come to think of it,you're{not!</content>
