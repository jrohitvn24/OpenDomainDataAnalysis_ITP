 sweets in the jar?","Hoopla","Treasure
 Hunt" and "Tombola".There are also    
 swingboats that go backwards and      
 forwards and people selling           
 hotdogs.The money raised goes towards 
 helping old people in the village.In a
 big tent there are fruit and vegetable
 displays,flower arranging,bees and    
 their honey and a pot plant           
 stall.Children's work and drawings are
 also on display.In a corner of the

 whilst other people sell their        
 paintings.
