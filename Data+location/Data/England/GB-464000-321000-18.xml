		<title>18Old People's Home.</title>
		<content> The Home,called Hunter's Lodge,is in  
 Church Lane and was originally the    
 stables for Dalby Hall Estate.The old 
 buildings were converted in 1983 at a 
 cost of Â£250,000 into an attractive   
 stone building with windows looking   
 out over the village.                 
 The Home is privately run and at the  
 moment has 32 residents with the      
 oldest person being 95.It provides a  
 lot of part time work in the village, 
 particularly for women.               
 Children from our primary school often
 visit the Home and entertain the old  
 people with songs,dance and drama.Some
 of the more mobile old people come to 
 functions at the school.The Scouts and
 Guides run an "Adopt a Granny"scheme  
 and some of them pay weekly visits to 
 a particular old person.The local     
 church also has a similar scheme.
