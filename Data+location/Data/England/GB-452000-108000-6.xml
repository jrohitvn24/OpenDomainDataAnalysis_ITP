		<content>    The most popular event in the      
 Curbridge/Curdridge area is the       
 Curdridge Show.  It includes side     
 stalls, competitions, sales and       
 business men trying to sell their     
 goods. Two to three events are held   
 each year.  Sometimes people go to    
 events to ask for jobs. Many people go
 to the event and a lot of money is    
 made.                                 
    Daffodil Day held at Fairthorne    
 Manor is a fun day where people go to 
 see flowers and the grounds.  A       
 helicopter is also there.
