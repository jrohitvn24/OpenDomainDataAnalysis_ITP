 Stanley most children had             
 computers.The most popular were the   
 C_64 and SPECTRUM.Most people liked   
 the arcade style games.Not very many  
 people had monitors and the average   
 playing time was 2_4 hours per        
 day.Nearly everyone has a joystick and
 only a few people have a disc drive.
