		<content>{Sir Frederick Gibberd}was a famous    
 architect who designed{Harlow New Town
 after the Second World War. He        
 designed air raid shelters during the 
 War.                                  
                                       
{Harlow New Town}was built to re-house 
 people from North London, which had   
 been badly bombed during the{Blitz.}  
                                       
{Sir Frederick}wanted people to have   
 pleasant houses to live in. He        
 designed them in interesting clusters 
 rather than in rows.                  
                                       
 He bought a bungalow in Harlow in     
 1956. It had been a smallholding and  
 he decided to build a beautiful garden
                                       
 His favourite foods included tripe and
 onions, egg and bacon and Lady        
 Gibberd's home made ice cream.        </content>
