		<title>04SHEEPWASH LANE BRIDGE</title>
		<content> The bridge provides a route for the   
 bridleway over the A3(M).When we went 
 to see it we noticed that barbed wire 
 blocked the way.Then we read in a     
 newspaper clipping,it said that       
 Hampshire County Council has made a   
 new move in the running fight to get  
 the Sheepwash Lane Bridleway          
 reinstated across a private farm      
 bridge over the A3(M) motorway at     
 Horndean. In an attempt to solve a 7  
 year stalemate, the county will       
 publish a Draft Creation Order to     
 restore the Bridleway which was cut by
 the A3(M) motorway in 1978. At the    
 present time horse riders and ramblers
 have to take an alternative and more  
 dangerous route across the Hazelton   
 interchange roundabout over the       
 motorway. A spokesman said'Many people
 would like to walk or ride horses on  
 the original route'.                  </content>
