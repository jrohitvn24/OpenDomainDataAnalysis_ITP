		<title>08TRAFFIC IN FENISCOWLES</title>
		<content>      On the 14th May 1985, we did a   
 traffic survey on Livesey Branch Road,
 on the edge of Feniscowles,Blackburn, 
 from 9.40a.m. to 10.00a.m.            
      On the side of the road with     
 vehicles going to Feniscowles, there  
 were 51 cars, 17 commercial vehicles, 
 1 bus and no bikes. Coming from       
 Feniscowles there were 34 cars, 18    
 commercial vehicles, l bus and no     
 bikes.                                
      We thought there would be more   
 vehicles at this time of the morning  
 because there would be some people    
 going to work and some doing early    
 morning exercise on their bikes.      
      The total number of vehicles that
 passed us was 122. There were 69 going
 to Feniscowles and 53 coming from     
 Feniscowles. We think that there were 
 more vehicles going to Feniscowles    
 because of the industrial units there.</content>
