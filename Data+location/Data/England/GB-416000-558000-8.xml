		<content>   Our names are Lindsay Cranmer and   
 Andreas Schrocksnadel. We are fourth  
 year juniors at Whickham Parochial    
 School. As part of our work for our   
 project we decided to visit           
 Mrs.Pyle,who we think is the oldest   
 person in Whickham. Mrs.Pyle was born 
 in 1891 and she is almost 94 years    
 old. She started school when she was 4
 years old. She attended our school,   
 although when she went to our school  
 it was in the old building in the     
 village which now belongs to the local
 council. The headmaster's house was   
 next to the school building. the      
 headmaster's name was Mr.Castles.     
 Mrs.Pyle told us that he always had a 
 strap in his hand ready to smack      
 anyone who misbehaved.                
   Mrs.Pyle didn't know when her family
 first moved to Whickham but her       
 grandparents lived here.              </content>
