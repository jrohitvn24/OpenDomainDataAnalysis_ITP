 One farmer has a private plane        
 78 Households (out of 140) have 1 car 
 25 Households have 2 cars             
 3 Households have motor bikes         
 5 Households use bicycles (apart from 
 children)                             
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT                      
 There is a privately owned bus service
 subsidised by the Wilts. County       
 Council, on weekdays. This provides 6 
 buses daily to Salisbury, the last bus
 returning at 5.40pm, except on Fridays
 - l0.30pm: 1 bus daily continues to   
 Shaftesbury &amp; villages intermediately,
 an extra one running on market day.No 
 buses run on Sundays. Except for      
 business people, very few residents   
 use buses; the bus service serves 66% 
 of the village only. It is dearer than
 car transport; some car owners give   
 lifts but buses are a useful reserve. </content>
