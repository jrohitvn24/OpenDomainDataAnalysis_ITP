		<title>02HUNTINGDROP  FARM</title>
		<content> Huntingdrop farm is 100 years old.    
 It has a herd of Fresian cows which   
 are for milking. There were six geese 
 and 4 goslings who were born this     
 year.The geese are sometime attaked   
 by foxes. Tyres are used for  holding 
 down  black  polythene  sheets under  
 which  silage  is  stored. The        
 silage  is used to  feed  the  cattle 
 in  winter  and   also  to  keep them 
 warm by spreading it in the cow sheds.
 There was a water pump by the farm    
 house which was used before tap water 
 was introduced.
