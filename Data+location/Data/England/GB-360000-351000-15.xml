		<content> around August or September, it is     
 chopped down by a Combine Harvester   
 (which is a large machine that has a  
 large barrel of spikes which rotate at
 the front). This is driven up the     
 fields and it separates the grain from
 the stalks (straw). The grain is then 
 bagged and the straw is baled and used
 as bedding for the cows and calves in 
 the winter.                           
  The farmers of Europe have joined an 
 organisation called the EEC (common   
 market), here many countries of Europe
 have joined together, and exchange    
 goods between themselves.             
  Unfortuantly there is too much       
 surplus product and the EEC has made  
 each country cut down on quantity.    
 This has affected many small farmers.
