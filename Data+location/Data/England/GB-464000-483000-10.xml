		<content> Population.                           
       Nawton (400+) and Beadlam (200+)
 have both grown steadily over the past
 fifteen years. Wombleton (250) has    
 seen its population fall during this  
 time.                                 
       A higher than average percentage
 of the population in the three        
 villages are retired. Many of these   
 people have moved into the area to    
 retire. Over 22% of Wombleton's       
 population is retired.                
       Many have retired here from     
 other parts of Yorkshire or from      
 Teeside.
