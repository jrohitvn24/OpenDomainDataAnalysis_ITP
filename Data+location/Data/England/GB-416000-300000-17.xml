		<title>17FARMING :DRAYTON BASSETT</title>
		<content>Farming in the area around the villages
of Drayton Bassett and hints falls into
two categories : 1. arable farming     
(wheat,barley,potatoes) 2. dairy       
farming on pasture and rough grazing.  
Arable farms are large in size (400    
acres) often consisting of 2 or 3      
seperate farms amalgamated into one    
unit, with large fields, capital       
intensive, highly mechanised.  Dairy   
farms are much smaller (50-80 acres),  
usually single family farms with one   
herd and small pasture fields divided  
by hedgerows.  Many small-holdings are 
disappearing, merged into larger       
economic concerns, with large arable   
fields (100 acres+), hedges removed,   
suitable for modern machinery, using   
maximum growing area.  Dairy farming is
giving way to more profitable arable   
farming.
