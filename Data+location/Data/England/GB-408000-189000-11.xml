		<title>11THE SCHOOLS AT PURTON STOKE</title>
		<content> The children of Purton Stoke had to   
 make their way to school in Purton in 
 all weathers until 1894.A petition    
 by the inhabitants resulted in the    
 Board of Education deciding that a    
 school should be built. Mrs N Storey  
 Maskelyne gave the site and           
 subscriptions were received from many 
 residents.Mr.E.Barnes built the       
 mixed elementary school for Â£600. The 
 school was built to hold 100 pupils,  
                                       
 At first the average attendance was 70
 but by 1977 the number was down to 26,
 so of course the school is now closed.
                                       
 Once again children go to schools     
 in Purton, the seniors go to Braydon  
 Forest and the juniors go to St.      
 Mary's C.E.school.
