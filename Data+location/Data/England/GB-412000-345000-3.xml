		<title>03Looking at Flowers and Trees</title>
		<content>We went for a walk on Tuesday June     
18th.1985 to look at wild flowers and  
trees along a footpath near our school.
We left the school in a North Westerly 
direction and found ourselves in a     
field for grazing ponies.The only} wild
flowers were buttercups,thistle,dock,  
dead nettles,stinging nettles and some 
clover that the ponies hadn't eaten.   
There was also vetch and foxgloves.The 
footpath led through two hayfields     
where there was stitchwort,clover,     
germander speedwell,dog daisies and    
goatsbeard.We changed direction and    
walked over a wooden stile into Slack  
Lane.A stream runs along the side.Here 
we found lots of pink campion and white
campion,hogweed,bugle,horse-tail,hedge 
parsley,Jack by the hedge,birdseye,    
forget-me-not,ladies' bedstraw and     
butterburr.  (Continued on Page 4)
