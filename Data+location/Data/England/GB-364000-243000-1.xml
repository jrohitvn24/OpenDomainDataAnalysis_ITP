		<title>01View from Castle Frome</title>
		<content> A quiet corner of old county of       
 Herefordshire.  From top of escarpent 
 above Castle Frome the view west is   
 over a rolling landscape of valleys nd
 wooded hills to highest point in      
 county on Black mountains.  Below is  
 small                                 
 valley of river Frome which flows past
 the parkland of Canon Frome and on to 
 join the Lugg. To north the A4103     
 carries the traffic between the twin  
 county towns of Hereford and          
 Worcester.  This is a thinly populated
 landscape with grass for fattening    
 cattle,cider apple orchards and hops. 
 The pattern of this landscape has     
 probably changed little in past 700   
 years.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
