St. Oswalds is one of the parks in     
Newton Aycliffe. It is named after one 
of the Bishop's of Durham. It is about 
the only park that is locked at certain
times and has a park attendant there   
constantly.                            
  There is a roller skating rink there.
It costs about 15p-30p to get into the 
rink. Sometimes it is used as a        
five-a-side pitch. One park, enclosed  
by fence, is for the under fives only. 
The rest is for anybody.               
  During the week there is a playschool
held in one of the buildings. There is 
also a nice bowling pitch there which  
is usually used in summer. There are   
also well kept flower beds and lawns.
