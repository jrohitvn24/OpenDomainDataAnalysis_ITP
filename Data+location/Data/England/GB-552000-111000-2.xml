		<content>  One of the major sources of income in
the area about Golden Cross is         
agriculture. There is no other large   
industry in the area and no            
factories. The farming consists of a   
number of small intensive farms owned  
by the farmers and are mainly arable   
farms. The major crops that are grown  
are wheat and barley, with some corn   
grown in small patches. A company      
wanting to buy the crop will send a    
buyer to inspect the grain and pay for 
it. The company will send a truck for  
it, thus lowering costs for the farmer.
  Some of the farms are mixed arable   
and also raise cattle.The cows are sold
for meat once a year in the nearby     
market of Hailsham and Lewes. There are
no pastoral farms and those that have  
cattle do it as a sideline to crops.
