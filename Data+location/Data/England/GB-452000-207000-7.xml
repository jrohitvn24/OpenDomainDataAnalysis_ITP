		<title>07THE FISH SCHEME.</title>
		<content>{ Dr Richards,}a local doctor, saw a   
 need for help for some of the local   
 inhabitants who had no-one to turn to 
 when in distress.                     
  Through the local{parish church}he   
 instigated the fish scheme in{1961}   
 which is still being used by{St}      
{Andrew's Church.}                     
  The scheme helps the{blind, deaf,}   
{handicapped}and anyone else in need.  
 The helpers and volunteers do         
 everything that a good neighbour would
 do, as Jesus taught all{Christians}to 
 do.                                   
  Anyone likely to be in need has a    
 card with a{fish symbol}on it. It can 
 be placed in the window to attract    
 help if they have no telephone. Most  
 streets have a volunteer who will     
 respond.                              
  The scheme has become internationally
 adopted from very humble beginnings.  </content>
