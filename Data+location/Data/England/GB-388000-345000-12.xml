		<title>12EDUCATION:SCHOOL AND COLLEGE</title>
		<content>The Stoke-on-Trent sixth form college  
at Fenton,was opened in 1970 by Harold 
Wilson,then Prime Minister.It caters   
for over eleven hundred students with a
comprehensive range of A and O level   
subjects offered. There are many extra-
curricular activities too,providing for
a wide range of sports and interests.  
Primary and secondary education has    
been reorganised in the city. Falling  
school rolls may be accelerated by     
urban change.On Leek Road there is a   
school which has been closed down.Near 
it old peoples bungalows have replaced 
terraced homes which had housed young  
families.The crossing warden used to   
see over eighty children across the    
road here - now she only has about     
sixteen. Part of the North Staffs      
Polytechnic falls within our area,some 
of its courses reflect local skills and
industries.                            </content>
