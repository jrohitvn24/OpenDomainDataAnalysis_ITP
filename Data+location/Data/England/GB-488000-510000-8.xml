		<title>08Tourism In Whitby.</title>
		<content>  Whitby depends more on its{tourism   
 than its shipping trade to bring      
 employment and wealth to the town.    
  The main holiday season is primarily 
 between May and October.Many private  
 residences have been converted to{Bed 
{and Breakfast/Flatlet}accommodation.  
 Visitors stay one or two weeks, or    
 come on one of the many day coach     
 excursions to the area.               
{ Gift shops}and{cafes}open especially 
 for the season.There are several{     
{amusement arcades}down near the sea   
 front and donkey rides are available  
 on the beach. Holiday makers like to  
 sunbathe, weather permitting!         
  The tourists, who are welcomed for   
 their trade and interest in the area, 
 sometimes cause concern to the local  
 community because of the{litter}and   
{parking congestion}they bring.
