		<content> We have ninety five pupils in Blagdon 
 school this year.                     
 We enjoy all sorts of sports and      
 outdoor activities, like natural      
 history. We built a small wildlife    
 area with a pond in the school grounds
 and we have an outdoor swimming pool. 
 We usually start the day with assembly
 at nine o'clock, but sometimes we     
 have assembly at 10.20a.m. We have a  
 games lesson on Friday or Thursday at 
 2.40p.m. For winter games we play     
 hockey and basketball. In the summer  
  we play rounders or minor games.     
 In the winter we have a lesson on the 
 large apparatus. In the summer we go  
 swimming in our school pool.          
 We have three cloak rooms,one library,
 a school house, the Headmaster's      
 office and four stock rooms. We have a
 small playing field where we play     
 rounders, football or do our sports.  </content>
