		<title>12POLLUTION</title>
		<content> The cause of pollution is raw sewage  
 and oil,but there are other causes as 
 well such as:                         
 poisons,rubbish,fumes,factories or    
 silage effluent.All these will        
 reduce oxygen so fish will            
 die.Detergent will also kill the      
 plants.The means of testing are as    
 follows.One man will stand in front   
 with a 240volt pulse stunner.Anot     
 stands behind with a net to catch them
 behind that another person has a      
 bucket to carry the stunned fish.So   
 three people are in the river. Also   
 another is on the bank measuring the  
 fish and taking scales off the fish to
 see how old they are.They measure the 
 length  of the fish to see if there is
 enough food for them to eat.The fish  
 will die in polluted water.Water      
 nymphs are counted in a sample of     
 river water as they need lots of oxyge</content>
