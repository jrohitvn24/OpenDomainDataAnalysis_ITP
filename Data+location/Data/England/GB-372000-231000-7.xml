		<content> Kate Brazington came to Redmarley in  
 1939.In those days there was no mains 
 electricity.A van came from Gloucester
 with paraffin for the lamps,cookers   
 and heaters.There was no mains water  
 so the village well was very important
 Some cottages had their own wells. It 
 was a common sight to see people with 
 a yoke on their shoulders carrying    
 buckets.There was no mains sanitation.
 Some houses had cess-pits,but most had
 a bucket toilet. Waste water was put  
 on gardens.                           
 Farming was very different and a lot  
 of the work was done with horses.Hay- 
 making and harvesting was a family    
 affair.Everyone had a job and meals   
 were eaten in the fields.It was a very
 happy time though at the end of the   
 day everyone was tired.The present    
 playing fields were allotments strips 
 of land were rented to cottagers      </content>
