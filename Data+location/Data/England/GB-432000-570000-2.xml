		<content>Whitley Bay has many attractions for   
the young and old.It's lovely long     
sandy beaches are good for keen        
walkers,brave swimmers or lazy         
sunbathers.There are also other        
attractions such as singing,dancing and
carnival parades which are usually     
performed in the Panama Dip.If it is   
raining there is no need to worry and  
there are still lots of places to go   
to.You can go to the amusement arcades,
the ice rink, the swimming  baths, the 
play house and the roller rink.        
    Whitley Bay has some poor points   
as well.In the summer the beaches get  
very crowded and there is lots of      
litter lying about.The indoor          
attractions also get very crowded and  
they become hot and stuffy.            
    We could improve Whitley Bay by    
having more beach activities and more  
sunshine!                              </content>
