		<title>11RIVER NIDD</title>
		<content> There are lots of shell fish like     
 crayfish and mussels in the river as  
 well.When the river floods it used to 
 cover the foot bridge,but now it only 
 floods the fields bordering the river.
 Above the river bank,on the North     
 side, there is a hill where a castle  
 or large house used to be.There is a  
 little sewage works which drains into 
 the river.The river is about 1000000  
 years old.By the river there are      
 birds,like moorhens,herons,mallards   
 and ducks which make holes among the  
 roots of trees for their homes.The    
 level of pollution in the{NIDD}is not 
 very high,but trout will not breed    
 easily in it.It is not navigable any  
 longer,but people think the{Vikings } 
 may have used it when they were       
 exploring this part of the land.Oyster
 catchers thrive on the freshwater     
 oysters found in the river.           </content>
