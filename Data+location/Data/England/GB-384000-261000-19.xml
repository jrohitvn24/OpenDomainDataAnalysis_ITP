		<title>19Salwarpe Parish Church</title>
		<content> The parish church of Salwarpe,        
 dedicated to St. Michael, is{Norman}in
 origin, but mainly 14th Century. The  
 Lych-gate to the churchyard dates from
 1884. Two 100 year old{Incense Cedars 
 are a unique feature of the           
 church-yard. A flight of 48{sandstone 
{steps}leads down from there to the    
 River Salwarpe. These steps are known 
 as "Jacob's Ladder". Like many small  
 village churches, three parishes have 
 amalgamated under one rector, and     
 Salwarpe has joined with the parishes 
 of Martin Hussingtree and Hindlip.
