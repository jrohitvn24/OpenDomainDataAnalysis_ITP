 small factories, warehouses, vehicle  
 depots, postal sorting office,        
 distributors, a dairy factory,        
 offices, workshops and a variety of   
 services for home and industry.       
    The numbers working in the         
 different industries vary from 2 self 
 employed people in a small workshop to
 200 working in a factory making lenses
 for spectacles.

 quite new and are made out of concrete

 mostly grey and quite low in height.
