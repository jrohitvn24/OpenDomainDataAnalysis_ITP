		<content> BATTLE IS AN ANCIENT VILLAGE WHICH    
 HAS BEGUN TO GROW QUITE RAPIDLY IN THE
 TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE VILLAGE CENTRE 
 DATES FROM THE MIDDLE AGES, AND MOST  
 OF THE SMALL TERRACED HOUSES HAVE BEEN
 CONVERTED INTO SHOPS WITH FLATS ABOVE.
 ALTHOUGH THESE HOUSES ARE SMALL, THEY 
 ARE VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEY       
 CONTAIN SO MANY QUAINT FEATURES SUCH  
 AS LEADED WINDOWS AND EXPOSED BEAMS.  
 TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE THE   
 HOUSES ARE MORE MODERN, LARGER AND    
 USUALLY DETATCHED. MOST OF THESE WERE 
 BUILT IN THE 1930'S, ALTHOUGH THERE   
 ARE SOME NEW HOUSES ON THE VERY EDGE  
 OF THE VILLAGE. ALL HOUSING IN BATTLE 
 IS EXPENSIVE, AND THERE IS ONLY A     
 SMALL AMOUNT OF COUNCIL HOUSING       
 AVAILABLE. HOUSING IS LIKELY TO BECOME
 EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE WHEN THE RAILWAY  
 LINK TO LONDON IS IMPROVED NEXT YEAR.
