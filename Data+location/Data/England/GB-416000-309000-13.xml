We visited the Gravel Pit and talked to
Mr Elson.The Gravel Pit is 17 years old
and it was 2 years before the plant was
constructed.The area of 550 acres used 
to be farm land and when they have     
finished digging out the sand they will
make it back to farm land.The filling  
will be P.F.A. P.F.A. is the waste ash 
from the power stations.There are 4    
sizes of gravel,6 millimetre is the    
smallest and is used for building      
blocks and some of it is sent to       
Scotland for pebble dashing houses.    
The next size is 10 millimetres,it is  
used for buildings and and roadways the
40 millimetres is mainly drainage and  
20x5 is used for concrete, mainly in   
Birmingham. There were 14 people       
working there and now there are 11,    
It was a very interesting visit.
