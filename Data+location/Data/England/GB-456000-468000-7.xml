 Priest in Charge with Stillngton,     
 Brandsby and Yearsley. There are      
 services held every Sudany and        
 sometimes through  week. The children 
 fromthe local Church school have      
 services in the church at main        
 festival times such as Christmas,     
 Easter, Ascencion Day etc. Catholic   
 people have to travel to Easingwold   
 for their nearest Church, Methodist   
 Chappel Worshippers also have to      
 travel to Easingwold.                 
 Apart from Church of England, Catholic
 and Chapel there appears to be no     
 other practising religions.
