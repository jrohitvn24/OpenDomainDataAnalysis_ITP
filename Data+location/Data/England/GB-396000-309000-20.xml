  Only the top North West corner of our
block covers parks of Cannock Chase.   
This section of the Chase is known as  
Shoal Hill which is dominated by       
deciduous trees. However,the Chase is  
one of Britain's major beauty spots &amp;  
in 1958 Cannock Chase was designated as
an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  
by the Countryside Commission. This    
recognised the rich variety of scenery 
on the Chase,from wild heathlands to   
secluded valleys. There are many red   
deer on the Chase and in medieval      
times the doe came to Calving Hill now 
the site of Sherbrook school,to give   
birth to her young.                    
  There are 45 listed buildings within 
the district. None are of exceptional  
merit (grade 1) but they are of special
interest (grade 2) and should be       
preserved eg the former Council House. </content>
