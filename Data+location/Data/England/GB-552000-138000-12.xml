		<title>12FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> A questionnaire completed by fifty    
 children showed that the most common  
 number of children in the family was  
 2. Seven had 2 brothers or sisters and
 six were only children. They all had  
 at least one grandma and grandpa but  
 some had two. Not many grandparents   
 lived nearby like they used to.       
 Saturdays and Sundays are quite       
 different from other days probably    
 because usually the family are        
 together. On Saturday a lot of people 
 go shopping in Tunbridge Wells in the 
 morning. In the afternoon all sorts of
 sports and activities take place.     
 Sundays are usually much quieter      
 days, in the morning some families go 
 to church. In the afternoon lots of   
 people go to the coast or for long    
 country walks, but some spend a       
 peaceful afternoon at home or with    
 their grandparents.                   </content>
