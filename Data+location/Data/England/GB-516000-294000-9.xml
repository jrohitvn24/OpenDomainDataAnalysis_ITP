		<title>09Orton Longueville Hall</title>
		<content>   Orton Hall is in the Village of     
 Orton Longueville, in the city of     
 Peterborough.  Its interesting        
 external features include landscaped  
 grounds with 100 year old Wellingtonia
 trees, castleated towers and          
 gargoyles.   It also has little       
 decorated archways.   It is now a     
 school for Educationally sub-normal   
 girls, some of who board at the       
 school.  It has some interesting      
 history in it.   Marquis Huntley used 
 to own the hall.   He was a gambling  
 man and his office had two front doors
 and two back doors, so that when      
 someone came to collect a debt, he    
 could escape by one of the other three
 doors and confuse them.  The site is  
 very old and the dining room has,     
 under a protective wooden floor, a    
 roman mosaic floor.   This room also  
 has coats of arms in stained glass.   </content>
