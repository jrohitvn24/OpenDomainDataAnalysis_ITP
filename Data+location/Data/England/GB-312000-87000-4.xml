		<content>  We interviewed some of the tourists  
 who come to Sidmouth. They said they  
 enjoyed coming here because of the    
{beautiful scenery.}Most had been here 
 before and found the sports facilities
 good, although the main attraction was
 the{beach.                            
  They also explored the beauty spots  
 in the{surrounding area.}Sidmouth is  
 obviously popular with those who want 
 a relaxing, quiet holiday.            
  The local people said that Sidmouth  
 would be a very quiet place indeed    
 without the tourists. They also       
 realised how important the tourist    
 industry is for providing many local  
 people with{employment.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
