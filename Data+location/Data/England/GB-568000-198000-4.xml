		<content> The Antique shop was a butcher's shop.
 It has been an Antique shop for 20    
 years. When it was a butcher's shop   
 they had a barn so it was called Barn 
 Hall. Near the barn was a hayloft in  
 the hayloft was an old pump. During   
 world war one 20 soldiers were        
 billeted in the hayloft.The hayloft   
 was to keep hay in the roof for the   
 animals. In the middle of the dining  
 room behind the Antique shop there was
 a well.The Antique store room used to 
 be a slaughter house for the butchers.
 The antique shop was the first        
 building in Stock to have fluorescent 
 light fitted. At night it became      
 alocal land mark as there are no      
 street lights in Stock and so the     
 bright light guided late night        
 revellers to their homes.
