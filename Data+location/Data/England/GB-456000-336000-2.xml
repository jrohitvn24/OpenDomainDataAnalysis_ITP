		<content>    The{River Trent}is the southern    
 boundary of the{Meadows.}People use it
 a lot. They use it for{fishing}which  
 is very popular.People go on the      
{pleasure boats}for trips down the     
 river, starting at Trent Bridge.The   
 river is also used for{canoeing}and   
{rowing.                               
    Every year there is a firework     
 display by the river. Lots of people  
 gather round the steps of the river   
 bank to watch. The{fireworks}are very 
 pretty.                               
    There are not many{swans}on the    
 river now because they are dying out  
 from lead poisoning which is caused   
 when they swallow the little lead     
 weights discarded by anglers. Also the
 fishing line gets stuck round their   
 legs.
