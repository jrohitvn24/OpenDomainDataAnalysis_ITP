		<title>11WE  LIKE RIDING HORSES</title>
		<content> Our names are Amber and Kim.We go     
 horse riding a lot but we do not like 
 going through the town in the Summer, 
 because there are always holiday      
 makers about and they do not know any 
 rules of the road.We ride ponies as we
 are too small for the larger horses.We
 ride over the Torrs and through the   
 Black Forest,near Comyn Farm,where the
 stables are.Kim has a pony and I am   
 hoping to get a pony for the Winter.  
 When we ride,we must wear a riding hat
 in case of accidents.Before we go rid-
 ing,we always groom our ponies,other- 
 wise they will be itchy and uncomfort-
 able.Then we put the bridle and saddle
 on the pony.When we return from our   
 ride we remove the saddle,rub the pony
 down and lead the pony to the field to
 graze.If it is too cold,the ponies are
 taken to a cosy warm stable instead.We
 are lucky to ride in such lovely land.</content>
