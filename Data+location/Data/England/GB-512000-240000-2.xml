 with pencils on paper.After doing this
 they would watch a television         
 programme entitled 'Picture Box.'This 
 was a programme about certain aspects 
 of a child's life.Most of the children
 enjoyed working at the school.The     
 youngest children seemed to be more   
 enthusiastic than the older children.

 aged seven in nineteen eighty five was
 three to five pounds a month.The      
 school had one computer to share      
 between all the children.A typical
