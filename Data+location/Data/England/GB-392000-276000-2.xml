		<title>02THE VILLAGE CHURCH _ HISTORY</title>
		<content>   {Belbroughton}village church now    
 stands on a site originally occupied  
 by a{Saxon}church at the time of the {
{Domesday Book.}In{Norman}times the    
 church was rebuilt, some parts of     
 which still remain and rebuilding has 
 taken place from the late thirteenth  
 century. The church now has an old    
 nave and chancel built in the         
 fourteenth century and a more modern  
 nave and chancel built in 1894.       
   In early {medieval}times, when there
 was no meeting place for the people of
 the village, the nave was used as a   
 meeting place and market. Feasts were 
 celebrated there and there would      
 have been plenty of room because      
 there were no seats only a stone      
 bench around the walls.
