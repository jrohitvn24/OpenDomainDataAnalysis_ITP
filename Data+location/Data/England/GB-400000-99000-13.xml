		<title>13FAMILY LIFE IN COLEHILL</title>
		<content> We wake up about 7.50 am. and have a  
 cup of coffee and a bowl of cereal,   
 then Alex, my sister, and I get       
 dressed.Alex goes to school with a    
 friend. I practise the piano, then I  
 walk to school. Mum is then busy with 
 housework. We follow this routine each
 day, but after school we do different 
 things. On Mondays I go to Cubs and   
 swimming. Tuesdays Alex and I have    
 piano lessons and Alex goes to Guides.
 We both go to the sports centre on    
 Wednesdays for swimming and Mum talks 
 to her friends. Dad works away from   
 home, but comes back from Hatfield on 
 Fridays, and Mum works at the nursing 
 home.On Saturdays I play football and 
 Alex goes swimming. On Sundays Dad and
 I fetch the newspaper and then Dad    
 does the gardening.We all have a      
 lovely roast dinner.(CHARLES CAMPBELL)
