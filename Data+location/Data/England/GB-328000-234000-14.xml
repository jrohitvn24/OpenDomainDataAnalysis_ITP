		<title>14SHOPPING.</title>
		<content>    The area is very isolated and has  
{no shop of its own.}People cannot     
 easily get into towns because of the  
 lack of regular public transport and  
 the time and distance involved.Most   
 people travel 14 miles into{Hereford }
 3-4 times a month for a "big shop".   
    The area is served by{2 mobile     
{shops}owned by different people.      
 Between them they cover the whole area
 at least twice a week.From them you   
 can get a whole range of foodstuffs   
 from sweets to fruit and vegetables.  
 You order each visit for delivery the 
 following week.                       
     There is also a{travelling Library
 which comes monthly visiting Craswall 
 on a Thursday and Michaelchurch on a  
 Monday.This van has different shelves 
 for each age group.It is very well    
 used.You can order a book for you to  
 collect on the next visit.            </content>
