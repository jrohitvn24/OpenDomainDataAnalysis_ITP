		<title>08BRANT BROUGHTON FOOD IN 1930</title>
		<content> Some local people were interviewed    
 about life 50 years ago.Here are some 
 snippets about food:                  
    "The farmer's wife would make      
 cheese and butter,which seemed to have
 more taste.Everybody used to keep a   
 pig so that they had always got some  
 meat.There was always some fat        
 bacon.We would have the pig treated   
 and hung.We would make all our own    
 pork pies, sausages,brawn and anything
 else we could."                       
   "A favourite pudding was steam roly-
 poly.A piece of paste was rolled flat 
 covered with jam and then rolled up   
 like a swiss roll and put in a cloth  
 bag.This was then steamed in a steamer
 on top of the saucepan which was      
 cooking the potatoes.Pudding was      
 always the first course the idea being
 that you got your fill with pudding   
 and so did not eat a lot of meat."    </content>
