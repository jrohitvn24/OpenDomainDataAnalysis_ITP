		<content> In 1920-1940 homes were much smaller  
 than now with no hot water. They had  
 an outside bathroom and a stable.     
 Now houses are bigger with electric   
 ovens,fridges and washing machines.   
 Shops always had seats,they  were     
 small and more homely but with less   
 things than now.At the present we have
 supermarkets such as {Asda,Waitrose } 
 and {Sainsburys.}                     
 Schools were crowded and much smaller 
 than now with about {45  children in  
{each class.}There were open fires,    
 benches and the children worked       
 with {Slate and Chalk}.Nowadays       
 schools are large comprehensives with 
 computers.                            
 The area was mainly fields with       
 dirt_tracks for roads.{The A4 wasn't  
{built until  1930.}Transport was by   
 bicycle,car or horse and cart.{
