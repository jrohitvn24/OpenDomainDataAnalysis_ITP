		<content> This area of Cornwall is very         
 beautiful with a peaceful atmosphere. 
 This probably explains its popularity 
 with tourists.Although during the     
 Summer months it is a fairly busy     
 area,there are still some visitors    
 during the Winter months,because of   
 the warm climate.                     
 The area is situated at the very end  
 of the Roseland Peninsula and although
 it is a beautiful area in which to    
 live,it is quite remote and transport 
 and employment can be difficult.      
 There is Virtually no industry in the 
 region for this reason.Farming,fishing
 and tourism provide employment for    
 most people who work within the region
 For those who live in the region      
 and travel to the nearest towns of    
 St.Austell and Truro,this means a     
 journey of 18_20 miles.Also in the    
 area there are a lot of retired people</content>
