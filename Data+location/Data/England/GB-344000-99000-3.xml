		<title>03HEALTH SERVICES: NETHERBURY</title>
		<content> The area is high, hilly and healthy   
 and the community is served mainly by 
 Beaminster's 4 G.Ps. who, together    
 with the community team, provide many 
 of the services which in an urban area
 would be available only in a large    
 hospital.  Bridport, four miles       
 distant, has a 24 bed general hospital
 with casualty unit and there are two  
 large district hospitals within 20    
 miles.  Home delivery of babies is now
 an untoward event, nearly all being   
 born in local maternity units.        
 Perinatal mortality for West Dorset is
 0.54%  Senior citizens are generally  
 in reasonable to good health.  Both   
 Beaminster and Netherbury have        
 warden-controlled apartments or homes 
 for the elderly and Bridport provides 
 both private and local authority      
 establishments.  New complexes are    
 under construction locally.           </content>
