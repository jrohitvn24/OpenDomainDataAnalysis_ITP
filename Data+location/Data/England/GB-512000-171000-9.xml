		<title>09LEISURE TIME OUT OF SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Kids today find anything to do. They  
 play out in the street, they go       
 swimming. They go to Kung Foo, but its
 all to do with money. They go to the  
 library to pass the time. They go to  
 Teddington Park. They even write on   
 the buses and the lamp posts. A gang  
 play all different sports. They even  
 count the ants to pass the time. They 
 go on their roller boots and they     
 still say they are bored. You see a   
 lot of horses in Teddington. Thats how
 people spend their spare time.
