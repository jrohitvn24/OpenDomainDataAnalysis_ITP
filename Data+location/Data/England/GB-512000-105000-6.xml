		<title>06DESCRIPTION OF FINDON VALLEY</title>
		<content> Findon Valley is situated to the      
 North-West of Worthing.It is 41m above
 sea level with a population of 1,665. 
 Findon Valley is 2.06 km2 in area,    
 occupies a narrow valley between two  
 steep chalk inclines,(Cissbury Ring to
 the East and High Salvington to the   
 West).Thus the environment is often   
 polluted by trffic noise and exhaust  
 fumes from the A24 bisecting the area.
 This is a developing area,the elderly 
 population is declining,the retirement
 bungalows are being replaced by       
 executive houses infilling former     
 large gardens,while younger people are
 now living in the valley.             
 Residents anticipate a future motorway
 through the area,and because of the   
 scarcity of building land in Worthing,
 Findon Valley will become another     
 urban sprawl,losing its village       
 identity.                             </content>
