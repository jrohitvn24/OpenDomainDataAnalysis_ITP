		<content> All Saints Parish Church is the very  
 old Anglican church adjacent to the   
 ponds.In Carshalton there are also two
 Roman Catholic churches (one by the   
 station and one in Fir Tree Grove);one
 Methodist church in Ruskin Road; two  
 Baptist churches and the West St.     
 Chapel for open brethren. The Parish  
 Church has very close links with the  
 church school and has about lOO       
 communicants at each Sunday Mass.There
 is a daily Eucharist. In l985 the     
 large Willis organ, originally built  
 in l895 was rebuilt thanks to a large 
 bequest of money. The 9 acres of      
 churchyard are being landscaped and   
 renovated by workers from the Manpower
 Servies Commission.This project is    
 expected to cost Â£l5O,OOO. New trees  
 are being planted and flora noted. The
 churches work together and on Good    
 Friday have a joint march of witness. </content>
