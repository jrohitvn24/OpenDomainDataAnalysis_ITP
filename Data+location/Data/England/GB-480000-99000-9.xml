		<content> The Birdham Church of England         
 (Controlled) Primary School is set    
 well back from the road about 300     
 metres from the old school. It was    
 opened in 1964 with two classrooms, a 
 hall, which had to be used as a       
 classroom, and a kitchen. Since then  
 an extra classroom was added to the   
 East end and a staffroom and office to
 the West end. Until l982 the hall was 
 almost continuously used as a class   
 teaching area. However in that year   
 the Parent Teacher Association paid   
 for and built a wooden classroom on   
 the North boundary of the school. The 
 School has about 100 pupils on roll.  
 The staff consists of a               
 headteacher,three full time teachers, 
 one part time teacher, a secretary, a 
 welfare assistant, three staff in the 
 kitchen and two cleaners.
