		<title>18A Caring Village Community</title>
		<content>                                       
 Although the Senior Residents remember
 Hanley Swan in the 1930's they agree  
 that the Village today has a very     
 caring community spirit.Recent events 
 sprang to mind;1983's severe winter a 
 local farmer provided milk,and another
 villager used his landrover to deliver
 food to Senior Residents.Changes have 
 taken place,the loss of small farms,  
 two pubs and four small shops.In      
 particular a general shop (a wooden   
 building which burnt down) seemed to  
 supply everything and be a general    
 meeting place.                        
   Sadly events like the Nov.5th bon-  
 fire and Pig roast on the village     
 green which have been celebrated for  
 years and brought the villagers       
 together have had to be cancelled as  
 unruly outsiders made it dangerous.
