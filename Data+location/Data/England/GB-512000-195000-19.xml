 We travelled to Elstree Aerodrome by  
 car and so we passed the reservoir and
 the blood laboratory. When we reached 
 the area we walked along a public     
 pathway and had to climb over the     
 stiles. This path took us along the   
 perimeter of the airfield. We got a   
 really good look. There were about    
 twenty aeroplanes in a compound. They 
 were all light weight aeroplanes owned
 by people who have flying as their    
 hobby. Many of the members fly as far 
 as Europe at the weekend and just stop
 to do their shopping! It is a very    
 expensive hobby. Learning to fly costs
 thousands of pounds, and then there   
 is the cost of the plane and fuel. For
 this reason some people share a plane,
 but apart from lessons and occasional 
 deliveries the aerodrome is not used  
 for business.                         </content>
