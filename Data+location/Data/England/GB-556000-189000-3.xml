		<title>03SOILS AND STREAMS: WARLEY</title>
		<content>   The poor drainage of the London Clay
 has led to the formation of large     
 areas of{Stagnogley}soils - although  
 the artificial drainage of these soils
 has been much in evidence in recent   
 years. In contrast, the supposedly    
 poorer parent material on the late    
 Tertiary/Pleistocene beds has been    
 left to support woodland - leading to 
 the development of paradoxically      
 richer soils -{Argillic Brown Earths  
 and{Brown Earths.                     
   Some streams flow estwards into the 
{Weald Brook,}which here marks the     
 boundary between Essex and Greater    
 London, and which joins the Thames    
 near Rainham. Others flow eastwards   
 into the{Mar Dyke}which crosses the   
 Essex Marshes to join the Thames lower
 down, near Purfleet.
