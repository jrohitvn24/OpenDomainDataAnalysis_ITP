		<title>05A Day in the Life of Ruth</title>
		<content> Saturday morning 9.15 a.m. I wake up  
 to the screams of my brother.I get out
 of bed lazily and walk to the bathroom
 half asleep.Once I've had a wash and  
 cleaned my teeth,I walk back into my  
 bedroom slightly more awake,and get   
 dressed.My mum shouts up to me"Hurry  
 up,we are going to town".I comb my    
 hair and quickly make my bed.I open my
 curtains and run downstairs.It is now 
 about 9.45 a.m.I quickly eat my       
 cornflakes and wash up.I run to get my
 coat and shoes to go to Warrington.At 
 10.15 a.m. my mum and I go in the car 
 to town.                              
 After rushing around the shops we go  
 to a quiet cafe for a cup of tea.At   
 about 11.30 a.m. we return to the car 
 and drive to Hood Manor and buy a few 
 things from the shops there.At 12.20  
 a.m. we arrive home shattered.
