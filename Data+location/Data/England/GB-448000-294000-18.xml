		<content> There is not a great deal of          
 industrial activity in the            
 area.However, in common with many     
 villages in Leicestershire, the area  
 has some knitwear factories.The most  
 notable such unit is the Couture      
 factory in Stoney Stanton. There are a
 few other very small units in that    
 village involved in the industry.In   
 the village are two garages and a     
 marine engineering factory.In Croft   
 there is the huge Croft Quarry ,the   
 largest synite quarry in Europe.There 
 is also a small modern industrial     
 estate making such items as sports    
 clothing ,special sheet steel,and the 
 retailing of oil products.Next to the 
 Fosse Way is a county council depot   
 dealing with major road repairs and   
 other similar activities.To the north 
 of the area isolated from any houses  
 is a large Calor gas depot.           </content>
