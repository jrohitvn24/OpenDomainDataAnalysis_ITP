		<content> Dunston is one of the few villages    
 that are privileged to have a house   
 built by a Prime Minister.The house   
 is owned by Mr Higginbotton and is    
 called the Manor House,although the   
 first Manor House for the area was in 
 Nocton.                               
        The house was inherited by     
 Frederick John Robinson on the death  
 of his wife's father (who was the     
 Fourth Earl of Buckinghamshire) in    
 1816.Robinson later became Prime      
 Minister from August 1827 to January  
 1828.                                 
      In 1972 a woodworm infested      
 staircase was removed from the Manor  
 House on the reverse side of one step 
 was writen William Bavin Joiner of

 November 13th 1824 and rebuilt this   
 house in 1824.
