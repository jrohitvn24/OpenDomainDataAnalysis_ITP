		<title>18ST.MARY'S -MAGDALEN LAVER</title>
		<content> THE CHURCH OF ST.MARY,MAGDALEN LAVER  
 dates from the early 12th.century &amp;   
 features subsequent addtions through  
 to the 16th.century when the tower was
 built. St. Mary's is one of a         
 declining number of rural churches    
 still in operation although the       
 pattern of its life has had to make   
 many adjustments. The congregation is 
 largely local &amp; small. The present    
 rector feels that the combined        
 factors of population movement &amp;      
 changing lifestyles have contributed  
 most to the decline of rural church   
 life: once seen as the core of rural  
 communities.The rate of change has    
 accelerated over the last 40 years.   
 Prior to the outbreak of World War 2, 
 there were three clergy officiating in
 the local villages;one at High,       
 Magdalen &amp;Little Laver. In 1945 High  
                                       </content>
