		<content>{Education}Strike action by members of 
 the largest teaching union affected   
 hundreds of Rotherham schoolchildren  
 this week. The{National Union of      
{Teachers}called out its members at    
 Swinton and Brinsworth Comprehensive  
 Schools and Kiveton Park Meadows      
 Junior School in pursuit of its wage  
 claim.                                
                                       
{The Coal Industry}Mr Peter Hardy, the 
 M.P. for Wentworth, says the N.C.B. is
 flouting an agreement made between the
 Pit Deputies union, N.A.C.O.D.S., and 
 the government. He claims the Board is
 ignoring the spirit of the agreement  
 made during the miner's strike and    
 warned that the deputies were becoming
 angry and frustrated because now only 
 collieries already exhausted could be 
 part of the N.C.B. review procedure.
