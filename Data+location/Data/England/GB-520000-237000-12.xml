		<title>12STOTFOLD BYPASS--OPINIONS</title>
		<content>                                       
   Argument is raging in Stotfold over 
 the proposed by-pass,with seprate     
 groups campaigning in the town.       
   More than{2,000}forms were sent to  
 Stotfold residents this week asking   
 which route they would prefer if the  
 bypass gets the go-ahead.The argument 
 is split between the{NORTHERN}and     
{SOUTHERN}by pass routes.              
 Mr{Arther Castle}said that both       
 arguments are based on{"Danger to     
{children and conservation."           
   The county council seem to favour   
 the Southern option which is shorter  
 and cheaper.This route would also     
 help{Letchworth}traffic to the{A1}.   
 The southern route leaves the A507    
 and runs round the back of Etonbury   
 school and joins the Hitchin road.
