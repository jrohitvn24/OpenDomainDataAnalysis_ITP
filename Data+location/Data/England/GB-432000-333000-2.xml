		<content>{On Sunday}I go to the Meeting House   
 three times.  We are Christians,      
 called the Brethren.  On Sunday       
 morning we have bread and wine.  In   
 the afternoon it's Sunday School where
 we sing and pray.  The adults go into 
 another room for their class.  In the 
 evening we pray and a man talks to us.
   A Hindu religious building is called
 a Mandir.  When we go in we take off  
 our shoes and sit down on the floor   
 and are quiet because people read     
 Hindu holy books like the Geeta.  The 
 Mandir is decorated by big pictures of
 the many gods we worship and tinselled
 bells.  Everyone stands up, sings two 
 songs and we say our prayers.  Before 
 everyone leaves we eat parshad, made  
 of semolina, ghee and sugar.          
    At the Pentecostal Church we sing  
 hymns,pray and have readings from the 
 Bible by the preacher or pastor.      </content>
