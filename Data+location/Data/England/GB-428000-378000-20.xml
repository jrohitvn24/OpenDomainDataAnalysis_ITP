		<content>  technical miracles which help to     
 bring some of the residents comfort   
 and some independence include a       
 'discus bed'which moves and changes   
 shape at the touch of a button and    
 a'possum'controller through which many
 things in the room can be switched on 
 or off when the user sucks or blows   
 down a tube.The gardens and grounds   
 can be reached by the residents in    
 their wheel chairs and those who wish 
 to, have access to a craft room.      
 Residents are helped to be as self    
 reliant as possible and are encouraged
 to help in the running of the home.
