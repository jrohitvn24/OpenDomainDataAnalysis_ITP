		<content> Our area is mainly comprised of       
{Crowthorne and Little Sandhurst and   
{Sandhurst.} The former developed      
 around the original railway station   
 which was built to serve{Wellington   
{College.}Large areas of land around   
 Crowthorne are still owned by the     
 College - although some are now being 
 developed. The broadleaf woodland     
 makes this a very attractive area to  
 the increasing population. {          
   {Little Sandhurst}is really a       
 developed village.  It was only in the
 1960's that this area started to grow 
 because of private housing.However,   
 there is no local industry apart from 
 the gravel extraction in{Sandhurst    
 which is the oldest village. There are
 some essential shops but the larger   
 shopping complexes are to be found in 
{Wokingham,Bracknell or Reading.
