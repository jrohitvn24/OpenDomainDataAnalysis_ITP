		<title>18Shopping in our area .</title>
		<content> There are 2 shops(which include a     
post office area ),1 in Ashbury and 1  
in Bishopstone .They sell groceries ,  
vegetables,fruit, newspapers and       
sweets aswell as hardware ,toys        
,stationery and china .Ashbury probably
has a better shop .It would be nice to 
have a clothes and shoe shop .The shops
are often used but many people do their
main shopping in Wantage or Swindon    
because it is cheaper and there is more
choice .In about 1958 there were 5     
shops in Ashbury  -Triangle Cottage,The
Cottage (Chapel Lane),a house opposite 
the Rose and Crown Hotel in the High   
Street, the present shop on the        
cross roads and a shop in Berrycroft.By
about 1963 there were only 2 shops,the 
Chapel Lane and cross roads shops.     
Nowadays mobile shops visit the village
and you can buy meat, vegetables,sweets
 and loan videos from them .           </content>
