		<content> The  monthly  Anglican Church magazine
 also  has  news  items for Methodists;
 they support one another by joint fund
 raising &amp; by sharing occasional Sunday
 evening  services. All 3 denominations
 are welcome at the Harvest Supper held
 in  the  Community Hall each autumn.At
 Wootton a{prayer group}meets regularly
 swelled  by  others  during the Lenten
 period. Lent  was  marked by a women's
 group preparing a weekly lunch of soup
 &amp; bread to raise money for the victims
 of the{Ethiopian drought.}The congreg-
 ation is  being  asked to consider the
 effects of the{Sunday Trading Bill}and
 to voice their opinions at the Deanery
 Synod. Everyone  squeezed into Trinity
 Methodist   Church  Abingdon  for  the
 Deanery Eucharist as it was too wet to
 hold it in Albert Park. Wootton people
 found  the hymns unfamiliar &amp; the arm-
 waving of some Evangelicals alarming. </content>
