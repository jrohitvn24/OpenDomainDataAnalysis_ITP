		<content>    In the early days, the Parish was  
 responsible for the care of the poor. 
 In the 17th century a{Workhouse}was   
 established in Shaftesbury Street.    
 After a fire in 1830, new buildings   
 were erected in 1835. These were      
 replaced in 1885, when a large and    
 roomy{Union Workhouse}was built in The
 Bartons. On the nationalization of the
 hospital service in 1948,it became{The
{Infirmary.}This year an extension has 
 been added. This replaces{The Cottage 
{Hospital.}Many elderly people are     
 cared for by nursing staff and the    
 local doctors. Some of the patients   
 will live the rest of their lives     
 there. Many of them join the day      
 patients for their meals in the day   
 room. Ladies from local organisations 
 come in on a voluntary basis. They    
 play simple games with the patients   
 and help to entertain them.           </content>
