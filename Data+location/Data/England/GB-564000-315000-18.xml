		<content>  Extracts from a diary by Simon       
 Dealtry aged 13 who lives at North    
 Runcton and attends Springwood High   
 School in Kings Lynn.                 
 "I am woken at half past seven  by the
 alarm on my digital watch, but        
 sometimes my cat wakes me up.         
 ... At school lunchtimes I usually    
 have a beefburger in a roll with chips
 and baked beans. Sometimes I buy a    
 drink which comes in a small carton.  
 ... I arrive home at a quarter to     
 four. I change into a pair of jeans   
 and a T-shirt. Then I do my{homework  
 which takes me about half an hour.    
 After that I normally watch{television
 until teatime. This evening it is     
 shepherds pie and broccoli. After I've
 eaten my tea I go for a bath or       
 shower. This evening I washed my hair 
 under the shower. I go to bed at about
 nine o'clock in the evening."         </content>
