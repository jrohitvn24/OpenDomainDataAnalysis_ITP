		<title>03Meals for a day in Patchway</title>
		<content>   A good English breakfast would      
 consist of bacon, eggs, sausages,     
 mushrooms, beans, and a glass of      
 orange juice or a cup of tea or       
 coffee, and toast. Cornflakes is      
 another.                              
   Lunch would be a salad, of lettuce, 
 cucumber, cheese, tomatoes, carrots,  
 onions, celery and boiled potatoes.   
 For a dressing youwould have a salad  
 cream.  If you have a snack between   
 meals you would probably have a packet
 of crisps, an apple or perhaps an     
 orange or biscuits.                   
   For tea you would have a good       
 filling meal.  My favourite meal would
 be fillet steak and chips, fried      
 tomatoes with peas and a sprinke of   
 parsley, for dressing I would have    
 tomato ketchup or brown sauce.  For a 
 supper you would have cheese and      
 crackers and a cup of tea.            </content>
