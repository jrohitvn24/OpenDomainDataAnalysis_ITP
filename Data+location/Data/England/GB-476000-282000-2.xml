		<content>The Braybrooke C.O. was formed in 1959 
when it was realised that in a small   
village of 350 inhabitants it was not  
feasible for all organisations to      
arrange major events. All village      
organisations may join and Youth Club, 
Church,Chapel,Village Hall,Tiny Tots,  
Cricket Club,W.I. and Brownies share   
the profits on a percentage basis.     
Usually about 1 thousand pounds is     
available for distribution. A committee
of 10 is elected annually and organises
a Garden Fete,Waste Paper collection,  
Harvest Show,Village Tour by Father    
Christmas and Children's Christmas     
Parties also occasional Quizzes,Beetle 
Drives and Teddy Bear's Picnic. The    
B.C.O. has been very successful not    
only in raising money but by bringing  
the community together and introducing 
newcomers to the village organisations 
and activities.                        </content>
