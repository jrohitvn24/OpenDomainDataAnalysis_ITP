		<content> There has been a Church here since    
 the 12th.century but in the present   
 building only the West Tower is       
 pre-19th.century.It was once called   
 Our Lady of the Island, but is now    
 called St. Mary's. John Richardson has
 been Vicar here for 10 years. There   
 are 4 or 5 services every Sunday and  
 the Church is shared by the Methodists
 "I don't think that anything should be
 done separately that you can't do     
 together":the Vicar. There are 2 Youth
 Clubs, Guides, Brownies, Cubs, Scouts,
 2 Toddlers' Groups and a monthly group
 for older people.The Vicar also       
 teaches and takes assemblies at St.   
 Mary's School.The Church receives     
 about Â£40,000 in collections of which 
 Â£8,000 is given away immediately,     
 Â£16,000 goes to the Diocese, Â£5,000 to
 the Church itself.Much of the rest is 
 for heating,lighting and expenses.    </content>
