		<title>01MILDENHALL</title>
		<content>{Mildenhall}or{"Minal"}is a quiet      
 village in the valley of the River    
 Kennet.The settlement dates from Roman
 times.The London to Bath road, the A4,
 runs just south of Mildenhall. The    
 population is small and there are many
 old people.It is a mainly agricultural
 area, used for arable and dairy farms.
 On the outskirts of Mildenhall at     
{Stitchcombe}there is a large vineyard,
 and there is also a trout farm, and   
 strawberry fields.Most of the houses  
 in Mildenhall are built along the main
 road through the village,though there 
 are a few big houses on top of the    
 valley.Some houses are privately      
 owned,and some are council houses.    
 There is a post office,and a church   
 with a large graveyard.In the centre  
 of the village there is a big village 
 hall,which is now closed as it is     
 unsafe.It is a very pleasant village. </content>
