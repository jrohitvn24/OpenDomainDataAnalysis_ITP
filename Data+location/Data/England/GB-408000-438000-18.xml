		<title>18The New Shopping Centre</title>
		<content> Bingley's new shopping centre was     
 built in the 1970's and provides a    
 traffic free shopping arcade at street
 level, with a library and restaurant  
 above. As well as the main Post       
 Office, there are two supermarkets, an
 electricity showroom, betting office, 
 job centre and a variety of food,     
 clothes and other shops.              
 In the middle of the arcade, seats are
 provided for shoppers and this is a   
 popular meeting place for young and   
 old people.                           
 At the end of the shopping arcade is a
 paved area on which a small market is 
 held on Wednesdays and Fridays. There 
 are seven stalls selling food, clothes
 and household goods. The market is    
 less busy than it was a few years ago.
