 Most of the area around {Milborne Port
 is used for farming.The majority of   
 fields surveyed were given over to    
 intensive grassland and a few cereal  
 crops.At this time most of the fields 
 are small with Hawthorn hedges as     
 boundaries.                           
 The majority of farms have been passed
 on through the same families for many 
 generations.It is most likely that    
 this trend will continue.             
 As this is a {dairy farming}area most 
 farmers surveyed complained that they 
 had suffered as a result of the       
 E.E.C.Milk Quota system.The bank      
 manager also commented that the future
 of dairy farming was in doubt for the 
 same reason.                          
 We expect that as a result the face of
 the farming land around this area will
 change over the next decade.          </content>
