		<content> A walk from Clockhouse Lane, Nutley to
 Cackle Street, Fairwarp.              
 We started our walk from Clockhouse   
 Lane. When we had got to the end of   
 the lane we were on the forest. We    
 noticed that it had been burned       
 because it was black and brown.       
 Further on, we saw some sandstone and 
 soon we came to a stream which we     
 jumped over. We walked up a very steep
 hill. While we were resting we saw a  
 Common Blue and a Tortoiseshell       
 butterfly. Beyond Misbourne, which is 
 a trekking centre and sheep farm, we  
 could count seven houses only. At the 
 bottom of the hill we waded through   
 another stream. We saw bracken,       
 heather (Bog, Bell &amp; Ling), tormentil 
 and birds including a Kestrel and a   
 skylark. In the forest valleys are    
 called 'ghylls'.
