 This was built in 1930 and has since  
 been greatly enlarged and modernised  
 largely through money raised by the   
 villagers.It is the centre of the     
 social life of the village. It        
 provides room for the Pre-school      
 childrens play group,the Good         
 Companions Club(for people over 50    
 years of age). It is used for meetings
 of the Fete Committee ( which has     
 helped to raise thousands of pounds   
 for the Hall ),the Parish Council and 
 other village clubs and associations. 
 It is in constant demand for Wedding  
 receptions,Dances and Parties.Every   
 Wednesday night it is used for Bingo. 
 The Hall is held by three trustees on 
 behalf of the village.Financially it  
 is self supporting.
