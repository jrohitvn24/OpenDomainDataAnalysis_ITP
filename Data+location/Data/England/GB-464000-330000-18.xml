		<title>18Gas in Kinoulton</title>
		<content>                                       
      There has been a supply of gas in
 Kinoulton since{1978-79}but only on   
 the Grange(Wimpey)Estate serving 112  
 customers.The gas supply is now being 
 extended as far as the canal, with    
 1275m of{main}and 70 service pipes.The
 cost of this will be{Â£50,000.         
      The pipes are made of yellow     
{polyethylene}and are expected to last 
 for as long as needed.The main pipes  
 come from Saxondale to Cropwell Bishop
 to Kinoulton.                         
      Gas workmen are slotting some of 
 the new pipes through the old water   
 main.                                 
      More people will be able to      
 choose gas as a source of energy.     
      Workmen have been digging up the 
 road and this has caused a traffic    
 problem.{Traffic lights}have been in  
 operation to keep the traffic moving. </content>
