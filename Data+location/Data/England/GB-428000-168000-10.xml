		<title>10Kennet and Avon Canal</title>
		<content> the{River Kennet}to the{River Avon.   
 The original route was via            
 Hungerford,Ramsbury, Marlborough      
 Melksham and Bradford on Avon, but    
 Rennie proposed another, more         
 southerly route from Hungerford to    
 Great Bedwyn,Devizes, Trowbridge and  
 Bradford.This took until 1810 to      
 complete.This was because of the very 
 steep rise at Caen Hill outside       
 Devizes.A flight of 17 locks each with
 a side pond was built to overcome     
 this.It cost over one million pounds  
 to complete but eventually the canal  
 was finished.                         
     The canal passes through the South
 East corner of our Domesday section.  
 This part of the canal is fed by the  
{Froxfield feeder,}a unique circular   
 weir, which divides the water between
