		<title>16A New House in Shiphay</title>
		<content>  We went to the Bovis Homes building  
 site. Each house has two skins made   
 from insulation blocks and red bricks.
 5,000 bricks are used for each house. 
 These come in packs of 400 and are    
 moved by fork lift trucks. Roof       
 trusses are ready made and held by    
 steel nails. Concrete roof tiles slot 
 together. The foundations are about   
 30cm deep and filled with ready mixed 
 concrete. About 9cm from the ground a 
 damp course is put between the blocks 
 and bricks. Plaster board is stuck toi
 the interior. One house had two rooms 
 up and two rooms down and would take  
 26 weeks to build at a cost of        
 Â£30,000. The water pipes are made of  
 copper and plastic. A bricklayer earns
 Â£3.50 for every 10 bricks layed and   
 can earn Â£100 a day. In a year Bovis  
 has built 250 houses on the Veille    
 Park estate.                          </content>
