		<title>20SOCIAL CONCERNS</title>
		<content>       We asked many people what they  
 thought about immigration, and they   
 said that, in their opinion,          
 immigration must be stopped or slowed 
 down, or there will be less jobs      
 around not taken and therefore more   
 unemployment.                         
       The farmers are great           
 conservationists and when many of the 
 trees died, due to Dutch Elm          
 Disease,they have replanted many new  
 trees.                                
       Every-one is appalled by the    
 recent soccer violence and think that 
 the offenders should be asked why they
 riot, and then the government should  
 take serious action.                  
       People said that Nuclear Power  
 was a good thing, but, although they  
 obviously did not approve of          
 Nuclear weapons, they should be kept  
 as a detterent.                       </content>
