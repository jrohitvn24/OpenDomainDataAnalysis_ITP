		<title>17Housing in Royston</title>
		<content>   There is a variety of houses in the 
 area. People have lived in Royston for
 hundreds of years and a few houses in 
 the town are very old.There are       
 victorian houses to the north of the  
 town some  are detached villas,others 
 semi_detached or terraced.These were  
 built without garages, because the    
 victorians didn't have cars.On Queens 
 Road there were some almshouses which 
 are now houses for old people.        
   The new  estates have a mixture of  
 all  types of housing. Most  have a   
 garage  and a garden.Some residents   
 think the houses are too close togeth-
 er, but most think there is enough    
 space.There are flats for elderly     
 people and a new home for old people  
 has just been built.Although there are
 areas of grass on the new estates a   
 lot of children play in the streets.
