		<title>05SHIRLEY  CORNER SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Shirley Corner school was built in    
 1887 and is situated on top of the    
 hill by the garage, on the Crediton   
 road. On the first day of the school  
 opening lots of children came but only
 one child was let in, because of the  
 infant age limit. On the next day     
 three more children were admitted.    
 After a couple of days the Governers  
 decided to change the age limit and   
 all ages of children were allowed in. 
 The toilets were built across the     
 playground. During the war many       
 evacuees came to the school. By the   
 1970s the school was very overcrowded,
 and they had to use the Chapel rooms  
 for some children. Eventually a new   
 school was opened on 4th July, 1975,  
 called Copplestone County Primary     
 School, and Shirley Corner school was 
 closed.
