		<content> The "D Block" is a largely rural area 
 of Hereford and Worcester approx. 12  
 miles south of Worcester lying in     
 undulating land between the vallies of
 the rivers Severn and Avon. It is     
 intensely farmed. It contains one     
 sizeable settlement in the S.E. corner
 at Defford, pop. approx. 300. This is 
 an ancient village mentioned in the   
 original Domesday survey, but with    
 much recent housing.There is a        
 subsiduary settlement at Besford 2    
 miles to N.                           
 Major landmarks are the radar station 
 on Defford Airfield and Croome Court  
 former seat of the Earls of Coventry. 
 The area is disected by the main      
 Birmingham to Bristol railway although
 there are no extant stations. The M5  
 just intrudes into the S.W. corner.   
 The block itself contains no major    
 roads.                                </content>
