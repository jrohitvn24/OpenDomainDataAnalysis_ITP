		<content>   Old  documents show that the name   
 of the village was not always spelt   
 "Brailes"{                            
 Some spellings used between the 12th  
 and 17th centuries are:Breilles       
 Brailis,Braeles,Brales,Breiles,       
 Braylles,Breyles,Brelis,Breles,Brayles
   There are two schools of thought as 
 to the origin of the name.One is that 
 a form of the Old English word for a  
 burial place was "braegels".This may  
 well derive from the existence of a   
 long barrow at Highwall Spinney.      
   The second is the suggestion that   
 the Celtic "bre" meaning hill, coupled
 with "lis" meaning a chieftain's      
 residence, is really the derivation of
 the name.Thus the two dominant        
 features of the village _ Brailes Hill
 and the fortified encampment of Castle
 Hill _ are linked, giving much support
 to this theory.                       </content>
