		<content> The{HERTS &amp; ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL}is      
 celebrating its 75th anniversary this 
 year.                                 
 Our second years described life       
 through three generations.            
 Samantha Page's{GRANDMA}was a pupil of
 the school 60 years ago.              
 My grandma, who was Kathleen Allen but
 is now Kathleen Palmer, went to the   
 Herts &amp; Essex High School about 60    
 years ago. School started at 9.00am   
 and she went home for lunch. Then at  
 3.30pm she went home.                 
 Grandma's headmistress was called Miss
 Hammill. When Grandma cmae here, there
 was only the old block, tennis courts 
 and a hockey pitch. When the pupils   
 had a games lesson they had to        
 participate if they liked it or not   
 and if you lost your gym shoes you    
 were fined money.
