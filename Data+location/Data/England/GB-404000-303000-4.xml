		<title>04EMPLOYMENT: BROWNHILLS AREA.</title>
		<content>   In the Brownhills/Walsall Wood      
 area coalmining and brickmaking were  
 traditionally the principal forms of  
 employment. However, since 1945 there 
 has been more diversification, light  
 industries having been established eg.
 metalworking on the Maybrook          
 Industrial Estate. Brickworks and sand
 and gravel quarries still provide some
 work  but coalmining came to an end in
 1964. Many workers are employed in the
 Birmingham and Black Country          
 conurbation whilst others travel to   
 the pits in the Cannock area.         
   The eastern, agricultural area      
 provides limited employment. Stonnall 
 is largely a dormitory settlement,    
 residents commuting to nearby urban   
 centres.                              
   Unemployment has grown in recent    
 years. 2354 people were unemployed in 
 July 1985 (1715 males, 639 females).  </content>
