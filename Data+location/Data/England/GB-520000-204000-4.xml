 Football Club and ground.There is     
 likely to be considerable controversy 
 if further attempts are made to       
 encroach onto the Green Belt.         
{Millwards -a young resident's view.}  
 Millwards is a housing estate in South
 Hatfield.The houses are all new and   
 behind them is a recreation ground.It 
 has a slide, a swing,a climbing frame 
 and big cement pipes to play in. Along
 side is a big field where you can play
 football,cricket or golf.             
 On the far side there is a zig-zag    
 path and in winter when the snow is on
 the ground it gets really glassy.We go
 down it on plastic bags.At the bottom 
 there is a ditch and you can go       
 whizzing round it a few times.
