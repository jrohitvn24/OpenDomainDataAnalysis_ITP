		<title>13  Lucy's Factory Oxford</title>
		<content>  We visited W.Lucy and Co. Ltd. Our   
first impression was of dirty high     
windows and dull paint work.We had a   
short talk with the works manager      
followed by a tour of the factory.     
There were many doors,corridors ,large 
areas and small rooms in the five      
floors.The floors were clean and tidy  
and no space was wasted.               
  The deafening noise of machines was  
very noticeable but we soon got used to
it.Men were at work wearing overalls   
and heavy boots.We saw a man checking  
a power transformer and a man applying 
a protective film of powder paint.We   
watched a man demonstrate a safety     
device on a machine:an infra red beam  
was used.Some machines use a cooling   
liquid to stop them over heating.The   
main work force was men but some women 
and disabled people were employed.
