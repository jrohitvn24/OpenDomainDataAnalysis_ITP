		<content>    Many people seem to think that     
 Lincolnshire is very flat, but in our 
 area  we have quite a few hills, in   
 fact it is quite undulating.          
 In our area we have one large village 
 one small village and three hamlets.  
 It is a quiet rural area which has    
 been inhabited since the Iron Age.    
                                       
    There is local evidence of the Iron
 Age near Scotland Lane and of the     
 Roman occupation just North of Lenton.
 On the eastern side of the Sapperton  
 Road in Lenton there is an unusual    
 field.In the field there are a number 
 of small hills.We think that these    
 hillocks have been there since Roman  
 times.  We think that they were Roman 
 fish ponds.  Now cows and sheep graze 
 there.
