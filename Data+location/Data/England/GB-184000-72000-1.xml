		<content> This is a coastal area on the North   
 Cornish coast.The magnificent slate   
 cliffs are broken by golden beaches at
 the mouths of the small streams which 
 run through steep sided valleys,      
 between flat-topped hills.            
 The largest settlement is the village 
 of St.Merryn to the E. Settlements, at
 the bays ,are the result of tourism   
 which with farming is the major       
 industry.Most people live in          
 bungalows.The area suffers a          
 population inbalance with the         
 emigration of the young adults and the
 immigration of the elderly.           
 Many of the farmers supplement their  
 income by running campsites on their  
 land during the summer months.        
 Transport is limited as most of the   
 roads are very narrow and the public  
 bus service runs only in the summer.
