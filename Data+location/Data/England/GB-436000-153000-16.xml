		<content> The{Shell Club}is for children between
 the ages of 7 and 13. It meets on     
 Tuesday evenings in term time from    
 6.30 to 8.00pm. Their programme       
 includes both indoor and outdoor      
 activities and competitions. There are
 12 members, and they recently         
 conducted a questionnaire among ten   
 retired local couples. All of these   
 liked living in the village, and had  
 done so ,on average, for 26 years.    
 Their most popular colour was blue,   
 their favourite drink was tea, and    
 they enjoyed eating a roast dinner.   
 They had liked being 50 years old,    
 and would buy a new car with any      
 unexpected money. They chose Wales or 
 Scotland for a holiday, and they      
 prefered newspapers to books. Most of 
 them, 8 out of 10 , felt that their   
 prayers had been answered at some     
 time.                                 </content>
