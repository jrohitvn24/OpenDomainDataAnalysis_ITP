		<title>17A day in Simon's life - 1</title>
		<content>     Today is Friday. I get up at eight
o'clock, get dressed, and get my       
swimming things ready, then I go       
downstairs into the kitchen. I watch   
television until about half past eight 
then I have a bowl of cereal. When I   
finish my breakfast I go upstairs to   
have a wash, then go back downstairs   
to ask Dad to clean my shoes. I put    
my shoes on, put my jacket on and get  
my swimming things, then I go to the   
garage and get my bike, open the garage
and ride to school.                    
     When I get to school I put my bike
in the bike shed and walk round to the 
front door. When I get inside I hang my
bag and jacket on my peg and go into   
the classroom, open my desk, get my    
pencil out and walk over to take the   
barometer reading. I write it down on  
the barometer chart, then Russell      
writes it down on the main chart.      </content>
