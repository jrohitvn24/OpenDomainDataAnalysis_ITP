		<content>   Oxbridge Lane Primary School is     
 situated on the very busy Oxbridge    
 Lane,which runs East/West and         
 links Stockton town centre with a     
 number of residential areas.Traffic   
 noise from the road often affects work
 in a number of classrooms where       
 vehicles pass within a few metres of  
 the windows.                          
   A group of children made a survey   
 of traffic at various times during the
 school day to see when the busiest    
 times were.The results of the survey  
 may be seen on the following page.
