		<title>19TRANSPORT PRESTON CAPES</title>
		<content> The area around Preston Capes has a   
 limited Public Bus Service taking     
 passengers to Northampton only.       
 Because of this, a high proportion of 
 families run two or more              
 cars/vehicles. Out of the adult       
 population of l79 _ l09 cars/vehicles 
 are used on a daily basis. There are  
 approx. 4 mopeds/motor bikes in use.  
 A Rural Wheels Scheme operates in the 
 area whereby if anybody needs to      
 attend or visit a Health Centre,      
 Hospital etc. and has no access to a  
 car, the local Co_ordinator will      
 arrange for a car driver to transport 
 them.                                 
                                       
 This project was compiled by members  
 of Preston Capes Womens Institute.
