		<title>20The Games We Play (cont)....</title>
		<content> As  soon as they have caught us we    
 have to  count. For a den you have a  
 bench or a drain cover.               
 My favorite game is Vegetable bob     
 downs because  you have 5 people and  
 1 of them has to be on. The rules are 
 to walk about then stop, then the     
 other people sit down very quickly and
 say a name of a vegetable. They have  
 to be quick because the person thats  
 on might get you. I play with my      
 friends Antony, Kirstie, Marie and    
 Samantha and another is the judge. I  
 like the game very much because its   
 fun.
