		<content> In my leisure time Ilike to play      
 football, read and watch T.V.There is 
 a football ground nearby on Sandy Lane
 where our local team play.Some people 
 in our area like going to the theatre.
 The nearest theatre is the Gracie     
 Fields theatre which is built onto    
 Oulder Hill Upper School.Some people  
 prefer to go to the cinema.The cinema 
 in Rochdale is the ABC situated on the
 Esplanade.At the top of Churchill St, 
 there is a pub called the Church Inn  
 and it has a bowling green.There is   
 also a bowling green near Greenbank   
 Primary School.Many people enjoy      
 jogging or running.Rochdale has a     
 running club where the Rochdale       
 Harriers are based.Parks are popular  
 for picnics in the summer and our     
 nearest park is Denehurst Park.The    
 largest parks in the area are Falinge 
 Park and Springfield Park.            </content>
