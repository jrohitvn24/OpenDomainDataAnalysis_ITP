 On Wednesday 3rd July 1985, 25 pupils 
 of Belford First School investigated  
 the verges of the footpath leading    
 West from the school beside the B6349 
 Belford to Wooler road.               
 Amongst the insect life found in the  
 wall were woodlice,7-spot ladybirds,  
 click-beetles and flea-beetles.A large
 mass of mother-of-pearl moth          
 caterpillars were found on the flowers
 of a stinging nettle.Common snails    
 were found in the wall and undergrowth
 -all with right-handed shells.Many    
 different types of spider were seen;  
 one inside a pocket made by joining 2 
 leaves of a stinging nettle together  
 with white threads.                   
 A skylark,chaffinch and wood-pigeon   
 were heard singing nearby and in the  
 distance,from the direction of        
 Sionside,a cuckoo.                    </content>
