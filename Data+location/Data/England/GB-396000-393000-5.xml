		<title>05 RESIDENTS PROBLEMS</title>
		<content>    Manchester is responsible for the  
maintenance of the houses and for      
choosing the occupants. Tameside       
shares responsibility  for the lawns.  
    The new residents did not want to  
leave their friends and jobs.  The     
distance from Manchester seemed        
immense.  90% were said to be unhappy. 
A lack of facilities led to unrest.    
It is an expensive bus ride to         
Hyde to do the shopping.Many of the    
complaints are about the coldness of   
the houses and the condensation.       
    During 1984 and 1985 a new central 
heating system has been put in.  Also  
flat roofs have been replaced by Apex  
roofs.                                 
    There is a forum which meets once  
a month to solve their  problems.      
    There is 30% unemployment amongst  
adults and 60% amongst juveniles.
