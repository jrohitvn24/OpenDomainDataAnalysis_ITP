		<title>09  Childer Thornton Farm</title>
		<content>    {Childer Thornton Farm}consists of 
 350 acres. It is a mixed farm which   
 means that the farmer grows crops and 
 has cattle for both dairy production  
 and beef.                             
    The farm, although it is mixed, is 
 mainly dairy, with 100 head of British
 Friesian cattle. The cattle themselves
 weigh 500kg to 600kg. When first born,
 the calves are taken away from their  
 mother and are fed 6 litres of their  
 mothers rich milk which gives them    
 immunity.                             
    When they are 4 days they are fed a
 special food called quicklettes. After
 7 days the calves are able to drink   
 water.                                
    The farm also has 3 pet lambs, a   
 cross between Suffolk and Cheviot.    
    The farm uses peas,rye, vetches and
 barley for silage which is fed to the 
 cattle in winter.                     </content>
