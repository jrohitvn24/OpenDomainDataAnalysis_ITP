		<content>  235 ships passed through the Double  
 Locks from May 1984 to May 1985. Many 
 of these used the lock in groups.     
 Small light craft like canoes are     
 carried along the canal bank.         
  We picked specimens from 48 different
 plants between the river and the      
 canal. There were 19 different wild   
 plants between Topsham Road and the   
 river.                                
  We caught two small dace; there were 
 also sticklebacks, minnows pike bream 
 roach, carp, eels, perch, millers'    
 thumbs and stone leach.               
  There are hedgerow birds and water   
 birds, like heron and kingfisher. We  
 see Winter migrants like redshanks and
 gooseanders.
