		<title>12A DAY IN CARE-WELLBURY HOUSE</title>
		<content>{1.35}Back to school,then I chose to go
 bowling in Stevenage,some others went 
 swimming in our swimming pool.        
{4.15}We arrived back at Wellbury and  
 played until tea-time.                
{5.00}We sat down to egg and chips.    
{6.00}We had another meeting and this  
 time we had to choose an evening      
 activity.I chose to do some cooking.  
{7.30}We were free to do what we wanted
 until supper.I cleaned my bedroom,then
 watched the television.               
{9.00}We had supper which was chocolate
 biscuits and coffee made with water   
 not milk.                             
{9.30}Went downstairs to see my baby   
 mice,which are five days old.         
{10.00}I went to bed.                  
{10.20}The lights were turned off.     
{10.30}The night lady was comfortably  
 settled and I was asleep.
