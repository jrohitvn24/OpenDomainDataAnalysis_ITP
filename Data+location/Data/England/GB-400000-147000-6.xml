		<content> The church of St.Thomas a' Becket,    
 Tilshead is very old. It was built in 
 the 10th Century or even earlier.     
 There are three cast bells in the     
 square stone tower. These were put    
 there in the 18th Century but they are
 not rung nowadays. The outside walls  
 have been built with the local        
 flint stone. The pretty stained-glass 
 windows were designed by the reverend 
 J.H.Johnson. The church organ is old  
 and rare. It was put in the church in 
 1906. We enjoy visiting our church and
 have produced many plays and concerts 
 in the simple and sacred surroundings.
 There is a story that the lock on the 
 font is to keep away witches and      
 their spells from the holy water. We  
 have lots of christenings, weddings   
 and funerals in our church. It is a   
 centre of our village life. It is     
 mentioned in the Domesday Book 1085.  </content>
