   Most of the block lies in the       
 Ecclesiastical Parish of{Holberton}but
 the western area is in the Parish of  
{Revelstoke}and includes the old Parish
 Church of St. Peter the poor fisherman
 spectacularly situated on the sea     
 cliff near Stoke House.               
                                       
   The Church was disused in 1881 when 
 Lord Revelstoke provided a new Church 
 at Noss Mayo outside the block but in 
 recent years St.Peters has been half  
 restored, it is still a consecrated   
 buiding and open air Religious        
 Services are held there. The tower is 
 originally beleived to have been a    
 Saxon Peel Watchtower.
