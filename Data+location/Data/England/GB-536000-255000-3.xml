		<title>03THE AREA'S HISTORY</title>
		<content> St.Mary's Church Comberton is part of 
 our local history.The present vicar is
 the Rev.R.Stephenson.The register of  
 baptisms dates from the year 1564.The 
 registers of marriges dates from the  
 year 1560 and the burials from 1561.  
   In 1925 there were two pubs. One was
  named the 'Tailors Arms'.The other   
 was named the 'Red Lion'.There was one
 wheelwright and one undertaker.There  
 was also a cycle maker.               
   There is an old dove cote in South  
 Street.It was designed and built by   
 Peter Frost in the 1700's.            
   The village of Toft was founded by  
 the Danes in the ninth century.The    
 word Toft is a Danish word meaning    
 homestead or field.                   
   Some people think that the name     
 Comberton is named after Cumbras Farm,
 but others think it is named after the
 Cumbrians.{                           </content>
