		<title>09LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IN CROYDON</title>
		<content>     The main centre for industry in   
our area is along the Purley Way.  We  
have found some isolated factories in  
various side streets and offices in the
London Road, but the largest complex   
is around Commerce Way, Trojan Way and 
Purley Way.  Many people we spoke to   
thought that an area for industry was a
good thing for local employment.  The  
transport to the area has been improved
and pollution and rubbish is easier to 
control.There is some heavy industry in
the area - boiler manufacturers and the
Ford Car Plant.  Most factories are in-
volved in light industry,e.g.X-ray App-
aratus, Paper, Tape and Card factories,
Ribbon, Confectionary, Plastics, Dyeing
and Cleaning. There are also warehous- 
ing facilities, and Fuel Distribution  
Centres. A few factories are empty, but
there are very few vacancies on the em-
ployment boards outside the factories. </content>
