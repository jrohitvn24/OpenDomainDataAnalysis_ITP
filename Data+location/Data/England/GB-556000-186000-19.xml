 people commute by car,train, or       
 underground to London where many have 
 professional,skilled,or semi-skilled  
 occupations.Others work mainly in     
{retailing and commerce}within 15 miles
 of Upminster,notably at Romford,Ilford
 and Barking.There is very little      
 manufacturing and/or manual work      
 available except along the north bank 
 of the Thames and at Dagenham where a 
 significant number still number still 
 find employment at{Fords.
