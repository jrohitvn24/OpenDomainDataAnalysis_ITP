		<content> Rock grew up as an estate village     
 centred on Rock Hall built round a    
 medieval  pele tower. The hall is now 
 used as a youth hostel with laboratory
 facilities. Rock church was originally
 a chapel in Embleton parish. The Rock 
 estates is farmed by the Bosanquets, a
 Huguenot family who bought the land   
 C1800. The village of Rennington was  
 also once part of Embleton parish. The
 original Norman Chapel was replaced by
 a new church in the 19c. Recently many
 new houses have been built in the     
 village and the vicarage turned into a
 nursing home. The other centre in     
 this area is Stamford, it now consists
 only of a farm and a few cottages.    
 However, it was once of considerably  
 greater importance than either Rock or
 Rennington. In early medieval time it 
 was the centre of the Barony of Emble-
