		<title>04Coal in the Dinnington area</title>
		<content> The first colliery in Dinnington was  
 opened in 1867 soon followed by others
 in the area and the{COAL INDUSTRY}    
 flourished,it was a major employer.   
 Coal was mined by tunnelling under the
 ground to the coal seams. In the      
 1960's with the decline of{COAL}the   
 collieries gradually closed leaving   
 open  only {BRENKLEY,}a DRIFT MINE    
 first opened in 1953, however this too
 will close in 1986 with a loss of even
 more jobs in an area of high          
 unemployment. {OPENCAST COAL}has been 
 worked for some time around{DINNINGTON
 top soil,rocks and shale are removed  
 to expose the COAL seams which are    
 then worked in the open.In the 1984/85
 miners strike work stopped and it has 
 not started again. When{BRENKLEY}     
 closes and the{OPENCAST COAL PROJECT }
 is concluded many years of{COAL}in the
{DINNINGTON}area will come to an end.  </content>
