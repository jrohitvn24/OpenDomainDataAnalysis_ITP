 works in partnership and each covers 4
 parishes.Lay people who are not       
 trained help with readings and prayers

 covering more than 1 parish.On Sundays
 he has to drive 3.5 miles from one    
 church to another arriving just on    
 time for each service.He has to travel
 about 200 miles a week.This travelling
 time could be spent praying or        
 studying. However, he has a cassette  
 player in his car to listen to while  
 driving.He finds that one can pray    
 well in a car.                        
{HISTORY}-The church was built in the  
 13th. century but destroyed by        
 fire.The new church was built 150     
 years ago.                            </content>
