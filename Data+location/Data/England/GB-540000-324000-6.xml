		<title>06THE FLOWER FESTIVALS</title>
		<content> Every year, usually in spring,most    
 villages in this area have a flower   
 festival. There is a great local      
 pride and rivalry between villages.The
 parish church and chaples are         
 decorated with floral displays, almost
 exclusively done by women. Many       
 visitors come from all over the       
 country to admire the display.        
    Very often the children are        
 involved and there is usually a       
 "theme" to each village festival.     
    At the time of the festivals many  
 of the fields have flowers in full    
 bloom and these are sign posted as    
 "Rural Rides" so that visitors can    
 drive in their cars to see them.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
