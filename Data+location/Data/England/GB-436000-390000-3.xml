		<title>03My Home In Sheffield 9</title>
		<content> I live at Brightside on Jenkin Road.  
 My house is about 70 years old, it was
 built in 1918. We've got 2 bedrooms   
 and an attic, where I sleep. Outside  
 in the yard is a small shed.          
  In the kitchen stands a washing      
 machine, tumble drier, cooker, fridge-
 freezer, sink unit, lots of cupboards 
 and a work top too. The bathroom has a
 toilet, bath and sink plus a shampoo  
 and talc cupboard.                    
  Inside the living room is a three    
 piece suite, glass cupboard, colour TV
 video cabinet, stereo unit and a gas  
 fire. We eat our meals sitting on     
 benches at the dining room table.     
  From my attic window I can see       
 Tinsley Viaduct and derelict          
 factories. After school I play with my
 sister and friends in our yard, or    
 cross the road either to the Rec.     
 playground or Castledine Gardens.     </content>
