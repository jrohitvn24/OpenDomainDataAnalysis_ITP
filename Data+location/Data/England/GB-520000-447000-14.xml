		<title>14T.V. VIEWING IN HORNSEA.</title>
		<content> A survey was conducted of the         
 favourite television programmes       
 watched by children in the 7 to 11 age
 range at Hornsea Primary School.The   
 replies were eventually divided into  
 six categories. These were:-          
                                       
 a) children's T.V./cartoons           
 b) American series                    
 c) English series                     
 d) comedy                             
 e) sport                              
 f) no favourite programme             
                                       
 American programmes such as "Street   
 Hawk" and "Airwolf" were the most     
 popular programmes especially for 9 to
 10 year olds. Sport programmes were   
 unpopular with all children.Comedy    
 programmes only appeared to be enjoyed
 by the older primary children.
