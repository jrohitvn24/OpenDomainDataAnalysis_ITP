		<content> Three months ago I moved into a new   
 small three bedroomed  house. My      
 sister has got the smallest room. My  
 sisters room measures 8*6 foot. My    
 room measures 10*12.My room is as long
 my dad's room. The top temperature the
 8 radiators get up to is 25 degrees.  
 All the bedrooms are built in the     
 roof. My dad put a tree in the back   
 garden. The kitchen  is quite small.  
 There is a lot of building going on   
 around us. Mostly there are trucks    
 dumping mud behind us. Also there is a
 hut near us.It is put up by the       
 workmen who live in there. They drive 
 JCBS and Hymacs. My feelings about the
 house is that its something to live in
 and its cosy and snug. When it is     
 raining I do not like it because it is
 all muddy outside.
