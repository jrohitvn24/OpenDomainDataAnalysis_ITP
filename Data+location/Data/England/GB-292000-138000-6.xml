		<content> We went outside by the 'phone booth   
 and did a traffic survey. There were  
 mainly buses and cars because during  
 the summer there are tourists and     
 visitors. There were also two tractors
 because there is a farm nearby.       
                                       
 In half an hour lots of cars came     
 past. There were 180 in total. The    
 most popular colour was red, 46 cars  
 and then white, 28 cars.              
                                       
 We also collected the registration    
 numbers and when we came back into    
 school we sorted them into sets with  
 the same year letter, the most common 
 letter was 'T'. We also counted 13    
 cars with Somerset registration       
 letters YA, YB, YC or YD.             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
