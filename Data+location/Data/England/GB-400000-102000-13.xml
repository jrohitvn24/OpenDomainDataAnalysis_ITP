		<title>13LIFE AND WORK OF A HOLT FARM</title>
		<content>{THE FARMS HISTORY                     
 The farm is called 'Holt Vale Farm'   
 Mrs Nuttand owns a house on her farm  
 which is 280 years old. Other parts of
 the farm are even older, like the     
 barn. Originally it was a dairy farm  
 but it hasn't been used for those     
 purposes for a year.                  
{MRS NUTTANDS THOUGHTS ON HOLT         
 Holt does't have many shops so she    
 shops mostly in Wimborne. She seems to
 have plenty of social amusements. Mrs 
 Nuttand chose to live Holt after      
 living Australia because of the peace 
 and tranquility of Holt. She has lived
 in Holt for fifteen years.            
{FARMING TODAY                         
 Poultry are kept for eggs; also on the
 farm are a dog and two cats. Her      
 husband is semi-retired and helps on  
 farms in the area.
