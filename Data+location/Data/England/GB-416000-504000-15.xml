		<title>15DOG BREEDING IN GILLING WEST</title>
		<content> We have three dogs and three bitches. 
 They are pedigree{Springer Spaniels.} 
 Five are liver and white, one is black
 and white.My dog is a pet.            
 The main mother is Tessa and she has  
 had about six litters of puppies.She  
 has about{ten to twelve puppies}in a  
{litter.}They are usually born at night
 so my mum has to sit up to make sure  
 they are alright.When the puppies are 
 about two weeks old their eyes open  }
 and when they are three weeks old they
 can lap up powdered milk. At seven or 
 eight weeks they are old enough to    
 leave their mother.{Our dogs are bred 
{for work.}They are{trained for beating
 which means{raising pheasants}and     
{retrieving shot birds.}When they are  
 old enough we take them out for       
 practice with a dummy gun so that they
 are fit to pick up{pheasants,woodcock}
 and{grouse}without fear of noise.     </content>
