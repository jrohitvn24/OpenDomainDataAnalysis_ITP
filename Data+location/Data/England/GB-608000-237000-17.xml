<content>

Capel st Mary primary school has been open for Many years and we have reasently waved goodbye to the beloved Miss Sirett (old head teacher) who has gone to work with a colchester school, so the great Mr Jackson has stepped in a got the job as head teacher. &lt;br />&lt;br />We have around 3 to 4 hundred pupils In the school, lots and lots of teachers and a caretaker Mr Brace who do a fine job on his own to clean the school up.   &lt;br />
