		<content>    Wentbridge lies alongside the old  
 A1. Apart from a small development of 
 expensive modern houses on the eastern
 side of the road, most of the houses  
 are close to the roadside and many of 
 them are quite old. Most of the houses
 are built from limestone, which was   
 quarried locally. Some of the houses  
 have stone flags instead of tiles on  
 the roof. Some of the houses have     
 Preservation Orders on them. Some are 
 houses converted from the old coaching
 inns.                                 
    There is only one shop in          
 Wentbridge. This is the Post Office   
 and General Stores. The shop is used  
 by some of the older inhabitants of   
 the village, but most of the trade is 
 casual, people buying single items as 
 they pass through, to or from the A1. 
    The petrol station belongs to the  
 Post Office.  This may be expanded.   </content>
