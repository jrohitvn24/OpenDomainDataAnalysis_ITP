{  }The old railway line is near our   
 school. The modern line, which is at  
 the end of the old line, is called the
{Ross Road Junction.                   
     On Saturday,6th July, 1985 a steam
 train came along the modern line. I   
 went to an exhibition to commemorate  
 150 years of the{Great Western        
{Railway.}The Mayor of Hereford was    
 there and Councillor Evans.           
    The King George V{steam engine     
 arrived from Bulmers. The steam train 
 was running from Hereford Station to  
 Cardiff Station. The Mayor inspected  
 the engine.                           
    Later on my friend and I had a look
 in the{coaches.}They were much smarter
 than coaches of today.
