		<title>17 CLIFTON - DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>   Clifton is a small village on the   
western part of this area. It is       
situated on a small bank or cliff above
the River Cherwell and it is in        
Oxfordshire.                           
   The {AGRICULTURE} is mainly cereals 
but there are grass meadows down by the
river. Hazelhedge Farm, to the north,  
is now only 2 barns.                   
   At the eastern end of the village,  
there is an old {WATERMILL} on the     
River Cherwell. It still has the       
remains of  the undershot waterwheel.  
A herd of goats is kept here and they  
sell goat's milk and cheese.           
   There is an old disused Methodist   
CHAPEL and an old CHURCH now used as a 
jewellery factory. There is a large    
POULTRY FARM. There are no shops; the  
nearest Post Office is at Deddington   
                                       
                                       </content>
