		<title>02FARMING. WILDEN AREA.</title>
		<content> Wilden has always been an agricultural
 parish. Almost all the land in the    
 Block has been cleared and is         
 farmed.Some 30 acres of remnant       
 woodland remain, only little less than
 in 1817 when the parish was           
 enclosed. Much of the land slopes down
 to South Brook.                       
{Arable and in particular cereal       
 farming predominates, with about 80%  
 of the land given over to crops and   
 fallow.Wheat and barley are the main  
 crops.  There are smaller acreages of 
 potatoes, rape,and brussel            
 sprouts.There is only one main dairy  
 holding, and one mixed.               
 A sizeable proportion of those in     
 employment work on the land, namely   
 some 40 farmers, and members of their 
 families, hired workers, and a        
 variable number of seasonal or casual 
 workers.                              </content>
