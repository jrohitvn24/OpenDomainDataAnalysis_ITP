		<title>12HOME LIFE IN HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> "I can remember when most cottages    
 were occupied by farm workers employed
 in the village or in Edworth. Few had 
 electricity or water indoors. Lighting
 was by oil lamps, cooking by oil or   
 "range" and drinking water came from  
 taps in the street. Yet 5 grocers,3   
 bakers and 3 butchers all called      
 regularly.The church had a large      
 congregation, there was a chapel a    
 school,a post office, resident police-
 man and roadman, a shop, a bakery, a  
 men's club and the buses were always  
 full! Now few houses are occupied by  
 farm workers most having been sold    
 off;only one butcher calls and no     
 other tradesmen;and the chapel,P.O.   
 and school have gone. On the other    
 hand we are now on mains drainage and 
 electricity, although there is still  
 no gas, and the community as a whole  
 is certainly wealthier."              </content>
