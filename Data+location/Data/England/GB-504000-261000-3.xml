      Many of the old, terraced        
 cottages are small by today's         
 standards and sometimes two or three  
 have been converted into one new home.
  There is a great interest in the     
 preservation of old buildings and the 
 external appearance has to be         
 maintained.  Thatched roofs cannot be 
 replaced by tiles.  Many of the older 
 buildings are listed buildings and    
 need special permission if they are to
 be altered internally.  The 'Fox and  
 Hounds' is undergoing such alterations
 at the moment.  The church which dates
 from the tenth century is the only    
 grade one listed building in the      
 village.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
