		<content> The Bath Road , in this area, has a   
 number of old Coaching Inns along its 
 length or very close to it on small   
 side roads.                           
 Highwaymen( perhaps even{Dick Turpin})
 plied their trade along this road in  
 the past gathering information about  
 wealthy travellers, it is alleged,    
 from accomplices who worked as hired  
 hands at the Inns.                    
                                       
 The {Seven Stars} is the second oldest
 coaching Inn on the Bath Road and     
 still has its original frontage.The   
 old Coach House is still standing and 
 is about to be converted, by the new  
 tenants,into a skittle alley.         
{130 yrs}ago the green outside this Inn
 was the scene of the last public      
 hanging in Berkshire. {Bare fist}bouts
 took place here when they were banned 
 from within a 30mile radius of London.</content>
