		<title>07Shush - Mum's writing!</title>
		<content> It was one Autumn afternoon in 1978   
 after our Tuesday playgroup session   
 in Filwood Social Centre when we      
 Knowle West mums decided that we had  
 missed out on schooling and would like
 to improve our writing and spelling.  
 We asked the W.E.A. whether they could
 provide us with an understanding man  
 to teach us every Tuesday. After      
 reading and discussing a story or poem
 with our teacher we would go home and 
 write something to read aloud the     
 following week.                       
 By Christmas our teacher decided to   
 publish our efforts in a booklet      
 entitled "Shush - Mum's Writing."     
 Copies were sent to Knowle Westers in 
 Africa, USA, Australia and Canada. We 
 became celebrities, appearing on ITV  
 and BBC television. A second book     
 entitled "Shush - Mum's Writing Again"
 was later published.                  </content>
