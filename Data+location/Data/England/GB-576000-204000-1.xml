		<title>01AN IMPRESSION OF DANBURY</title>
		<content> Danbury is a small village on a hill  
 standing at a height of 365 feet above
 sea level,which is one of the highest 
 points in Essex.It lies 5 miles South 
 East of Chelmsford on the A414.       
 If you were to walk through Danbury   
 you would see all the trees growing   
 in and around Danbury. At Eves Corner 
 you might notice the ducks waddling   
 around the reed bordered pond. There  
 is a common in Danbury which is owned 
 by the National Trust and a country   
 park which encompasses a series of    
 ornamental lakes. These are used for  
 leisure by the people of Essex.       
 Although Danbury is today a commuter  
 village it has a long history. Its    
 name may have originated from the     
 Saxon tribe Daenningas. The word      
 "bury" probably comes from the Iron   
 Age ditch which once ringed the hill, 
 which remains a popular vantage point.</content>
