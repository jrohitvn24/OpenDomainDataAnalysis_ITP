		<content> On one of our Domesday visits we went 
 to the Pop_In. It is a place were     
 elderly people go to enjoy themselves.
 If younger people go there they will  
 never turn them away. When you go in  
 there is a notice which shows you the 
 fixed rota for the day and for the    
 rest of the week. The person incharge 
 of the Pop_In is Margaret Dooly.The   
 people who help there are all         
 volunteers. The things they do are    
 knitting,sewing,art and crafts, darts,
 snooker and other activities. To keep 
 the Pop_In going they have to raise   
 Â£45,000 every year. They do this by   
 collecting clothes and teddys and     
 making things out of them to sell.    
 Food is provided by the council for 65
 pence per meal. We think that the     
 Pop_In is a good idea because some    
 elderly people might not have anybody 
 to go to, or to talk to.Sharon Bigger.</content>
