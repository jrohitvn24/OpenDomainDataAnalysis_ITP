		<title>04     BRICK AND FLINT</title>
		<content> Brick &amp; flint is both functional &amp;    
 decorative.Once used because it was a 
{free local stone,}it is now chosen to 
 add character.Flintwork patterns,often
 diamond,rectangular or square,are part
 of 9"brickwork in old houses &amp; can    
 form the front layer of a cavity wall 
 in new.                               
  In the 1920's farmers paid women 6d a
 bushel for stone-picking.Piled flints 
 in field corners are still used in    
 building-these are best because they  
 are weathered &amp; of a suitable size.   
 Flint quarried locally has to be      
{napped }ie. cut to hand-size with a   
 flat face.                            
     Flintwork needs great skill in    
 laying.Mortar,previously only lime &amp;  
 sand,is now mixed with cement.Three   
 new cottages with flintwork are being 
 built in Beacon's Bottom.Materials    
 from old buildings are being used.    </content>
