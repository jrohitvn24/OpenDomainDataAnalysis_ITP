		<title>12Shops-Silverdale and Knutton</title>
		<content>In the l950s there were about 80 shops 
in Silverdale.Now the centre of the    
village has been demolished and most of
the old shops have gone.There are now  
less than 30 shops.Most of these are in
the new shopping area called The Parade
which has a bank,a computer cabin and a
post office.We carried out a survey and
discovered that most of our mothers    
shop at a supermarket in nearby Knutton
or go to Newcastle-Under-Lyme,our      
nearest town.My grandad said he did his
shopping every day when he was young   
because there were no fridges and food 
soon went bad.                         
Knutton has a number of small village  
shops.There are six small general food 
shops and two off-licences.There are   
two fish and chips shops,always a      
favourite food,and a post office.There 
is only one very large supermarket in  
our area.                              </content>
