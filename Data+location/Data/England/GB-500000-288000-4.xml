		<content>On Thursday the 16th May 1985          
Penny Keeling and I went on a tour of  
Oundle School.   There have been two   
organs in the school counting the  new 
one.   That organ is called the        
Frobenius and is named after its       
builder and designer.   At the back of 
the chapel are some windows called the 
Seven Ages of Man designed by          
John Piper.  The first window          
represents the infant, the second      
represents a schoolboy creeping        
unwillingly to school, the third window
represents the lover, the fourth window
represents the soldier, the fifth      
window represents the Justice of the   
Peace, the sixth window represents the 
headmaster, the last one represents the
second child.   At the cloisters there 
is the oldest staircase in the school  
which is made of marble and is very    
beautiful.                             </content>
