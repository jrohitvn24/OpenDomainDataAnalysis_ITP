		<content> Trent Barrow is a strange{wooded hill 
 one kilometre east of the village of  
 Trent. There is a pond in the middle  
 of the hill, it is said that nobody   
 knows how deep the pond is.           
 There is a{legend}about a coach and   
 horses which lost its way one winter  
 and disappeared mysteriously and has  
 never been seen since. The legend says
 that you can hear the sound of hooves 
 at night-time.                        
 It is thought that the Barrow used to 
 be a{marl pit.}Marl is a sort of clay 
 which was used on the fields to       
 improve the soil.                     
 The top of the hill is covered with   
 trees and undergrowth, the sides of   
 the hill are planted with European    
 Larch. In the season there is pheasant
{shooting}every two weeks: local men go
 beating.                              
                                       </content>
