		<content>   At Bedgrove First School we play a  
playground game called "Spaceships &amp;   
Bubbles".If you are a spaceship you    
can zoom about going to all different  
planets.If you are a bubble it is very 
hard to steer as you only have four    
pretend control buttons.We also have a 
"rainbow machine"which we can all go   
in together to travel to different     
planets for our entertainment.         
  Dodge ball is another game lots of   
children play.You need a football.You  
have children in a circle then you need
some more children in a bigger circle  
outside them.The outside children have 
the ball and they have to throw the    
ball at the inside children and the    
children in the inside have to dodge   
the ball.If it touches anybody below   
the knee they are out and join the     
children on the outside.When everybody 
is out the outside circle goes inside. </content>
