		<content> .THE NEWBURGH ENGINEERING COMPANY.    
 ---------------------------------     
    The company was built in 1938 on   
 the site of an inn called the Newburgh
 Arms.  They are precision engineering 
 suppliers and produce components from 
 the very small up to 20 tonnes or     
 more.  The products are used in a     
 variety of industries for example     
 Power Generators; Energy(Nuclear, Oil 
 Gas, Coal); Armaments; Aerospace and  
 Chemical.  At this time 170 people    
 work at the factory and most (86%) are
 men.  Nearly half the work force are  
 from Bradwell.  Each year the firm    
 employs 5-7 school leavers and also   
 some disabled people.                 
    The company provides a canteen and 
 a social club for the workforce.      
 There is a union, but not everyone who
 works there is a member.
