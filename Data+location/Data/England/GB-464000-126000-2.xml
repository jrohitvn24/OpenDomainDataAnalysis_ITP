		<content> The Privett Post Office and Store is  
 the natural centre for news and the   
 Postmistress is a mine of             
 information.As well as the Post Office
 service she sells bread, milk, fresh  
 &amp; frozen groceries, greengrocery and  
 everyday sundries.  Her husband       
 delivers bread, milk, groceries and   
 the newspaper to the scattered homes  
 in this area.  Always welcomed he is  
 often the only link with the older    
 folk living alone and takes this      
 responsibility very seriously.  The   
 nearest Doctor's surgery is at West   
 Meon, 3 miles away.  The nearest      
 Policeman is at Petersfield, but is   
 swift to answer a call for help.  The 
 Mobile Library calls fortnightly with 
 an excellent selection of fiction and 
 non-fiction for both adults and       
 children.                             
                                       </content>
