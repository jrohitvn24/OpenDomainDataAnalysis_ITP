		<title>15 Trees in our area</title>
		<content> Each pupil recorded the trees in four 
gardens.                               
 We found that 42% of all trees were   
deciduous and 58% evergreen. Most      
people prefer to grow evergreen trees  
in their garden.Most people when asked 
said this was because they did not lose
their leaves and so look nice all year 
round providing a nice hedge for       
their privacy.                         
Away from gardens in the natural wild  
area where we live 91% of trees were   
deciduous. The most common deciduous   
trees were beech,ash,oak and willow.   
Only 2% of all trees found were        
saplings most of these having being    
planted by man.What a shame!           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
