		<content>   Most of the land near our school is 
 farmland.  They grow crops like wheat,
 barley and rape on it.  Near Hinwick  
 there is grazing land.                
   A lot of trees around our school    
 have disappeared.  Some were cut down 
 because of Dutch Elm disease.  Some   
 new trees have been planted in our    
 school field.                         
   Sometimes we see pheasants on our   
 field.  Often we see members of the   
 crow family.  The sparrows and blue-  
 tits come to feed at our bird-table.  
 Sometimes great-tits come and a few   
 chaffinches.  Two years ago  a great- 
 spotted woodpecker came.  He came back
 a few times.  Duncan once saw a golden
 oriole near school.                   
   Near Hinwick House there is a field 
 with ridges in it.  We think that     
 maybe a long time ago these were      
 strips of land worked by the people.  </content>
