		<title>13LOCAL HISTORY, CHELWOOD GATE</title>
		<content> Recent pipeline excavations in the    
 forest revealed small flints dated    
 neolithic and mesolithic periods, then
 an archaeological dig there uncovered 
 a possible pre-Roman defense earthwork
 on the late Iron Age track. Bunce     
 (Birch) Grove is mentioned in Domes-  
 day. In 1268 Ashdown Forest was en-   
 closed as a Royal Hunting Forest re-  
 sulting in local place names of       
 "hatch"  and "gate". The oldest habi- 
 tation dates from the 17th century.   
                                       
 Stumblewood and Chelwood Commons,     
 bordering the forest, in the Manor    
 of Broadhurst, were enclosed in 1864; 
 the land divided into plots  on Chel- 
 wood Common giving its present        
 character. Stumblets in the area show 
 connections with the nearby iron      
 workings.
