		<title>18STANION MAY DAY</title>
		<content>  The May Queen each year is elected by
 the children of the school.The Queen  
 is always a fourth year girl.Our May  
 Day is usually a day in the middle of 
 the month so that we have time to     
 rehearse and hopefully,the weather is 
 likely to be better.The May Queen has 
 to prepare a speech which will show   
 her thanks to the children who voted  
 for her and to the person who made the
 cake.                                 
  This is what 1985's programme looked 
 like.                                 
  {2.00p.m.}Children assemble on the   
 playground to the song "Lord of the   
 Dance"                                
       The scene is set.               
   The crowning of Vivienne Chudley as 
 May Queen by her aunt Mrs Davies.     
   May Queens's speech.
