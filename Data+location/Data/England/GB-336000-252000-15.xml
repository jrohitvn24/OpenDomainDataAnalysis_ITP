		<title>15Housing - Broxwood Area</title>
		<content> There are very few recently built     
 houses in this area. Buildings are    
 fairly scattered and blend into the   
 landscape. As the farming population  
 has declined, many houses have changed
 hands, and are now rented or owned by 
 people from outside the area.         
                                       
 Most of the larger buildings are      
 farmhouses and are owner-occupied.    
 Some are old timber framed dwellings, 
 with examples of cruck beams.The 19th 
 century estate houses in Broxwood are 
 of red brick in an attractive style   
 common to them all. The original      
 farmworkers cottages are of stone or  
 brick, and a few older ones are timber
 framed                                
                                       
 Near Broxwood is an interesting house 
 which was brought by road from Moor   
 Court, near Lyonshall.                </content>
