 Where I live there is a lot of        
 woodland and I see lots of wildlife.At
 night when it's starting to get you   
 can see badgers seeking food.Later you
 hear the dustbins go over.If you look 
 out you will see the badgers in the   
 bins.We used to have some chickens but
 the foxes came and killed them.We see 
 a lot of hares in spring having boxing
 matches.We see most animals in        
 summer.There's a squirrel's drey near 
 the oldest tree and when there are    
 apples the squirrels come and pinch   
 them.In the winter time you can see   
 the mice digging tunnels in the       
 snow.Sometimes the owls dive and get  
 the mice.We have lots of birds nesting
 in the old walls and there are some   
 swallows nesting in the stable.       </content>
