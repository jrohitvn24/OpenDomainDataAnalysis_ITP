 Other than having relatives fighting  
 World War II made little impact on the
 area.A lot of bombs fell on York and  
 people remember following the fire    
 engines going to deal with blazing    
 buildings.Only one bomb is recalled   
 and it fell near the main railway     
 line.It missed a train but blew up a  
 stack of potatoes _ no trace of them  
 was found afterwards.A horse was      
 killed and some damage done to the    
 line.Tholthorpe airfield,part of which
 is in the area,was in full operational
 use.One plane,apparently off          
 course,tried to land in Raskelf       
 hopping three times through hedges,a  
 tennis court and stream, finally      
 stopping at a tree nearly  two miles  
 away.There was also a searchlight in  
 the village and a home guard company.
