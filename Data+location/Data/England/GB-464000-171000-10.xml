		<title>10HOUSING.CALCOT,READING</title>
		<content>    The Calcot area is one of the areas
 designated for extensive housing      
 development in the Reading Plan.      
    Quite quickly,all the available    
 open space,not specifically ear-marked
 for recreation or council purposes,is 
 being bought up and built upon.       
    The most common 20th century house 
 in the Calcot area is the terrace     
 house.However,the semi-detatched is   
 almost as common.                     
    The majority of the houses being   
 built today are semi-detatched.They   
 usually have three bedrooms,some four.
 Depending on area,house prices range  
 from Â£40,000 to Â£120,000.Most of the  
 houses now being built are            
 open-planned with lawns and gardens.  
    Calcot is favoured by house        
 purchasers because of the available   
 jobs,excellent shopping facilities,and
 the easy access to the M4 motorway.   </content>
