		<title>03THE CHURCH IN DOWN ST MARY</title>
		<content> The church was built in the 12th      
 century at the crossing place of two  
 ancient roads. The door way is an     
 example of early Norman work with     
 small stained glass windows on either 
 side. Just above the door is a picture
 of Daniel in the lion's den. The inner
 arch is the oldest of the  arches and 
 one of the few Saxon remains found in 
 the county. The church is very well   
 built although much of it was rebuilt 
 in 1871. Inside there are lovely      
 carved bench ends. All the windows are
 stained glass and mostly are of Mary  
 and Christ. The screen separates the  
 nave from the chancel.
