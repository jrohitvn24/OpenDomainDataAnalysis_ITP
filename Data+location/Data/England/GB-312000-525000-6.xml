 area, after farming, the main         
 attraction for tourists is the        
 spectacular scenery.  To cater for    
 tourists there is one hotel, five     
 houses and seven farms providing Bed  
 and Breakfast.  One Inn which offers  
 accommodation, and seven cottages and 
 flats let to holiday makers for self  
 catering, plus two caravan sites. A   
 few farmers provide camping areas for 
 Scouts, Guides or Tourists.  For      
 recreation, the village has a         
 flourishing Tennis Club. There is     
 fishing in the river, for which a     
 permit may be obtained, or walking and
 climbing the fells, painting or       
 photographing the beautiful scenery.  
 Entertainment in the form of Darts and
 Dominoes can be enjoyed at the Inn but

 quiet of the village.                 </content>
