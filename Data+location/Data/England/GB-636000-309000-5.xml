		<content>    Mr. Gleeson asked us whether we    
 would go to the Police Station. We    
 walked up to the Police Station and we
 rang the bell. We were really nervous.
 We told them we were from Blofield    
 School and what we were doing. He     
 asked us in and we asked him, and some
 other policemen questions. They gave  
 us brief answeres and were very nice. 
 After we'd finished we said godbye and
 went back to the minibus.             
    We found out that the busiest time 
 is during the summer when there are   
 plenty of holidaymakers. A lot of time
 is spent with traffic work and        
 problems.There is not a lot of big    
 crime, only smaller offences.
