		<title>02HACKLINGE AREA LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The landscape is flat and open        
 with occasional pockets of deciduous  
 woodland. The main Sandwich-Deal road 
 runs diagonally from northwest to     
 southeast. The land east of the road  
 is cultivated polderland reaching the 
 shore line at Sandwich Bay, the main  
 waterway is the Delf Stream running   
 into the River Stour at Sandwich. The 
 land rises up to the road and drops   
 away on the west to marsh-fenland     
 watered by the North and South        
 Streams. It rises as arable farmland  
 to the highest point south of Ham. A  
 slagheap consisting of waste from the 
 coalmine at Betteshanger covers a     
 large part of the southeast corner.   
 It has recently been landscaped and a 
 new drainage lake has been            
 constructed on its southern side.
