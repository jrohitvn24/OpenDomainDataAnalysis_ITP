		<title>04THE ECOLOGY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content>    Comberton and Toft  have a rural   
 ecology.                              
   In Comberton there are 7 rubbish    
 bins.In Toft there are 9 bins,though  
 those by the the bus shelter are not  
 that well used.Rubbish is still being 
 dropped. Wood shavings,sponge scraps, 
 laces, tins and paper are thrown away.
   There are 11 footpaths in Comberton.
 One going from the bridge to the rec. 
 it was made in 1967.Another path went 
 through a farmers land.At first the   
 entrance was wired off but recently   
 has been opened.Most paths have easy  
 access,but one path was sown over,    
 another path is blocked off.In Toft   
 paths go from one lane to another.    
   Some of the natural history that    
 appear in the two villages are birds  
 foot trefoil,sycamore,foxes,weasels,  
 squirrels,fieldmice,pike,snails,      
 fieldfare,redwing and yellow wagtail. </content>
