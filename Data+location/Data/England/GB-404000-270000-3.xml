		<title>03The M42</title>
		<content> The M42 is the newest motorway in     
 Britian.  This motorway links up the  
 M5 to the M1.  Throuhout the village  
 of Rowney Green,a very remote village 
 thre are mixed feelings about the     
 motorway.  Many think the Motorway    
 will have no or little effect on life 
 in the village.  One man we           
 interviewed said he was on the        
 committee to divert the Motorway.  He 
 was very "anti" the motorway because  
 of many reasons. These are 2 of them, 
 its has ruined the scenery, and it has
 caused a rift in village others say   
 that the village will not be afected  
 either way and some say it is the key 
 to the future.  A majority prefer the 
 motorway.
