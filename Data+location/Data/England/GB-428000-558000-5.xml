		<content>{Employment}is an important concern.   
 The majority of{unemployed}are aged   
 17/24, mostly school leavers.  Many   
 visit the Job Centre where about 300  
 jobs are available at any one time but
 only about 16 are accepted.  Most of  
 the employed are manual workers, aged 
 25/35.                                
    Another important issue is the     
 welfare of the{elderly.} Rosebery     
 Court and Peacehaven Court provide    
{sheltered housing}for the elderly.    
 Donwell House,{old people's home,     
 houses 50/60 homeless, handicapped or 
 lonely people, aged 50/100+.  Doors   
 are locked to prevent the less stable 
 wandering off but visits to clubs and 
 bingo are arranged.                   
    There is also some concern about   
 proposals to move{VI formers}from     
 schools to{Tertiary Colleges}in the   
 Sunderland area.                      </content>
