		<title>18SENIOR CITIZENS-HAMSTERLEY</title>
		<content>  A sample survey of Senior Citizens   
 showed a group of people generally    
 satisfied with their way of life,     
 mainly independent following many and 
 varied pursuits.Ages ranged from early
 60 years to late 80 years,many still  
 living with their partners and nearly 
 all in regular contact with friends   
 and relations. Those in need of help  
 at home are provided for by Social    
 Services.Visits to a doctor appear to 
 be about average for the age group.   
 Most did their own shopping at        
 supermarkets at nearby towns,but meat 
 is mainly got from the village butcher
 Interests are mainly followed in and  
 around the home through reading,crafts
 and television,also activities at the 
 village hall and church.They enjoy    
 living here for the peace and quiet,  
 beauty and friendliness for which they
 accept any disadvantages of rural life</content>
