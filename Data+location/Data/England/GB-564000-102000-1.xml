		<title>01Pevensey and Westham</title>
		<content> The region comprises{Pevensey         
{village, Pevensey Bay and Westham     
{village}.It is a very{marshy area     
 bordering the English Channel,indeed  
 at one time the sea came inland as far
 as Pevensey village,lapping the walls 
 of the castle.A naturally formed      
 shingle bank moved the sea 2.5Km      
 Southward. Now the area has           
 been drained and is chiefly grazing   
 land.Buildings range from the Roman   
 and Norman castles and hundreds of    
 years old houses to the modern holiday
 bungalows.This is a popular tourist   
 area with an historic background of   
{William the Conqueror's landing}in    
 England.There are pleasant beaches    
 having a range of facilities.This is  
 also a popular area for many  retired 
 people,and is central to several      
 surrounding towns, like               
 Hastings,Bexhill and Eastbourne.      </content>
