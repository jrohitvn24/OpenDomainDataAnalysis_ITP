		<title>11The Railway of Endon (1).</title>
		<content>    The present line is now a single   
line for the whole of its length and   
it is still used for freight traffic,  
serving the quarries at Caldon Low and 
the British Industrial Sand Works at   
Oakamoor.Endon Station was a typical   
country station with two platforms and 
loading docks,a level crossing,signal  
box,booking hall and office,waiting    
rooms and a goods yard.Both platforms  
had gateways leading on to a dock area,
which was to allow the easy loading of 
milk churns and for passengers to get  
on and off the trains.                 
    Most of the milk was taken to      
Stoke-on-Trent.The gas lighting for    
the station was produced by dripping   
water into calcium carbide which formed
an acetylene gas. In the goods yard    
there were two sidings,a covered       
storage area, a weighbridge a cattle   
dock and a coal depot office.          </content>
