		<title>03Amenities in Whitwell</title>
		<content>  The two provision shops in Whitwell, 
 one of which incorporates a Post      
 Office,serve the community,and there  
 is a Methodist Church,a Village Hall  
 and a Youth Hostel.Renovations and    
 improvements have been carried out to 
 several of these recently.The majority
 of the building along the High Street 
 is of stone,or mellow brick.Gardens   
 are well maintained in general        
 throughout the village,and there are  
 green areas.An unusual feature of the 
 village is a series of water pumps,   
 installed by a local benefactor in the
 past.                                 
 A hope was expressed in a recent      
 community survey that no further      
 development should take place,to      
 avoid urbanising the village, and some
 considered too much had already been  
 allowed.                              
                                       </content>
