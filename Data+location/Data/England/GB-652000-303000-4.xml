		<content> Gorleston has declined in importance  
 in recent years, partly due to the    
 erosion of much of it's fine beach in 
 the late 1960s, and also because of   
 changing holiday patterns. Fewer      
 people now are inclined towards guest 
 house and hotel accomodation, more    
 preferring caravan and self catering  
 flats or holiday camps. Elmhurst, the 
 only such camp within Gorleston, was  
 closed in the early 1970s. Since      
 Gorleston has never provided a very   
 wide range of evening entertainment   
 comparable to that to be found in     
 Yarmouth, the increasing problem of   
 reaching the latter through heavy     
 traffic in the evening has also       
 deterred holiday makers from          
 staying in the town.
