		<content> Whitley bridge is a mainly post-war   
 village,consisting of stone           
 cottages,and one small estate with    
 more modern houses.                   
 In the village, the average number of 
 people living in each house is Three. 
 Two members from each house are over  
 Eighteen years old. Over 60% of the   
 local population are either retired or
 unemployed and the rest either work or
 go to school.Of those who are         
 employed,most work for local firms or 
 are self-employed.Others work at      
 Eggborough Power Station,which is     
 about 1 Kilometre away.               
 About 70% of the houses are privately 
 owned, and the majority of them have  
 been built for about twenty years.    
 About 90% of the householders         
 own their  own transport.             
 The only Annual event is a Gala at the
 local Community Centre.               </content>
