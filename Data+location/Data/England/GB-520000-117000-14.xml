		<content>   Most residents seem to enjoy their  
 life-styles, albeit that amenities are
 limited and less easily accessible    
 than those enjoyed by a town or city  
 dweller. Disadvantages have been      
 traded for space, quiet, a rural      
 setting and a sense of personal       
 involvement with the area.            
   Some young people are less enthus-  
 iastic, feeling themselves cut off    
 from school friends and the excitement
 of town events and amenities. Limited 
 local employment and limited access to
 that further afield is also a source  
 of concern.                           
   The quiet and rural atmosphere seems
 to generate a measure of independence 
 and self-sufficiency, but the car,    
 telephone and television seem to have 
 become totally indispensible features 
 of country life.
