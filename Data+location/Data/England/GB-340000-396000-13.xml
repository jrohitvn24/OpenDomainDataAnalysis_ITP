		<title>13Traffic passing Kirkby C.E.</title>
		<content> Our school is on a busy main road and 
 on Tuesday 26th February 1985 some out
 of our class conducted a survey to    
 find out the type of traffic that uses
 the road. I counted 365 cars and      
 taxis, 25 buses, 73 lorries and vans, 
 25 motor bikes and bicycles and 10    
 other types of vehicle.               
 We started the count at 1.40 p.m. and 
 finished at 2.20.p.m. We used a tally 
 chart to mark down the number of      
 vehicles we counted.                  
 When we got back to school some of the
 people who had been counting the      
 traffic made a graph to show our      
 results. They cut out small cars to   
 show the number of cars, small lorries
 for the number of lorries and so on.  
 Each shape on the graph stood for 10  
 vehicles. When the graph was finished 
 people could easily see the wide      
 variety of traffic passing our school.</content>
