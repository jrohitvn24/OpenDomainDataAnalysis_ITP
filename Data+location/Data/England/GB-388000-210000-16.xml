		<title>16CRANHAM WOODS</title>
		<content> Cranham Woods are a feature of the    
 parish and cover several square       
 miles.Most are owned by Major Birchall
 or Witcombe Estates. The trees are    
 mostly beechwith some yew and holly as
 undergrowth. There are many paths and 
 bridleways, some waymarked, running   
 through, which are well used. Betwwen 
 the 1920's and 1948 one large house,  
 now demolished, was a private         
 sanatorium, and its site is now       
 occupied by a sawmill using mainly    
 local wood for fencing products.      
 Squirrels, foxes, badgers and rabbits 
 are common while roe are present but  
 rarely seen. Kestrels and occasionally
 buzzards are seen and in the winter   
 flocks of woodpigeon are very         
 evident.In recent years considerable  
 felling has taken place making parts  
 of the woods very open and undergrowth
 is increasing.                        </content>
