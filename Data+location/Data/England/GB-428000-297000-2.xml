		<title>02MEDIAEVAL MARKET TOWN</title>
		<content>The Monks of Bec in Normandy during the
11th century were offered the manor or 
estate of Atherstone by Hugh,Earl of   
Chester.The Monks of Bec used the      
revenue to support their Abbey in      
Normandy.In 1289 burgage tenements were
set around the market area and along   
the Watling Street in an attempt to    
establish a market town with borough   
status.In1294 there were 36 free       
tenants in the manor.A twice weekly    
market was granted to the town and also
an annual fair.However the town failed 
to thrive and never achieved borough   
status.                                
  At the end of the 14C the land was   
given to the Augustinian preaching     
friars who  built a chapel which was   
in regular use for worship until       
the dissolution of the monasteries     
in the 16th Century.
