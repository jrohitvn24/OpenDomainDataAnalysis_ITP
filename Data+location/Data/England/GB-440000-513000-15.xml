		<title>15      THOMAS BROWN</title>
		<content>   Thomas Brown was born in            
 Kirkleatham. He was an apprentice to a
 shoemaker and his father was a        
 blacksmith. Whilst serving as a       
 private in the King's Own Regiment of 
 Dragoons he became one of Yarm's best 
 heroes. During the Battle of          
 Dettingen, in Bavaria on 27 June 1743,
 the standard was captured. In the     
 midst of heavy fire Thomas bravely    
 fought his way round and recovered it,
 although two balls got stuck in his   
 back and three in his hat. He returned
 to Yarm and took over an inn, where he
 lived for three years. He died on 18  
 January 1746 and was buried in the    
 parish churchyard. In 1908 the inn    
 lost its licence and was renamed      
 "Thomas Brown House".                 
   On 23rd March 1985 the band and     
 horse of The Queen's Own Hussars      
 visited Yarm in honour of their hero. </content>
