		<title>13Shopping in Eccles 2</title>
		<content> Further along Church St. a cinema has 
 closed and it has been converted into 
 a 'Kwik Save' supermarket. Along the  
 main road towards the library there is
 a variety of small shops, such as a   
 pork butchers, stationers, a DIY shop,
 banks, solicitors and various public  
 houses, one of which is called The    
 Town Hall. The Town Hall proper is    
 also on this street and so is the Post
 Office. Shopping in Eccles has been   
 developed considerably since the      
 precinct was built as there were      
 streets of terraced houses on the site
 previously. There are a number of     
 small cafes and 'take-aways' on the   
 street, including chip shops. Nearly  
 all of the pubs serve lunch time bar  
 snacks as well.
