		<title>02Notes on type of coverage.</title>
		<content> This area is remote from our school   
 and with its thinly scattered         
 settlement and paucity of roads it has
 been difficult to cover in detail as  
 many aspects as we would have wished. 
  Consequently we have included a      
 large number of impressions           
 -particularly poetry.                 
 The district has its own poets for at 
 Piedmont lives Michael Horovitz and   
 his son Adam;Laurie Lee came here for 
 nutting and blackberrying (Cider With 
 Rosie p.188)-and Frank Mansell,author 
 of Cotswold Ballads,knew the area     
 intimately.                           
 We are fortunate in being able to     
 include poems by the Horovitz's and by
 Frank Mansell.
