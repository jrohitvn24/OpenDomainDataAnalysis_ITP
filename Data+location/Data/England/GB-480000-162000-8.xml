		<content>      The day, following{Midsummers    
{Day,}was one of the wettest days in   
 June.{Saturday 22nd was the Crowthorne
{C of E Schools Summer Fayre.          
    Early in the morning people set up 
 their stalls inside the school,       
 because of the rain. Articles for sale
 on the{White Elephant and Plant stall 
 were priced. Some children organised  
 side shows{e.g.Jack Box, Pick an Egg, 
{Ping Pong Ball, Chopsticks and        
{Peanuts,Pick-a-straw and Steady Hand. 
 Kimberley and Jule ran a stall called 
{Pick an Egg,}they raised Â£8-10. For   
 their stall they needed lots of empty 
 eggshells, which the class had been   
 collecting. To organise their stall   
 they put a box filled with sawdust on 
 the table and put about 20 eggshells  
 in it. They put a sticker in 5 of the 
 eggs. You could win a packet of       
 refreshers if you found a sticker.    </content>
