		<title>06FARMING IN WINTERINGHAM</title>
		<content> The two distinct types of soil,shallow
 and light over the limestone, deep and
 heavy  in the reclained marshland, are
 the reason  for  the two main types of
 agricultural  usage.  Large  areas  of
 grain  almost  devoid  of  hedges  and
 trees   are  found  on  the  limestone
 hills,  root  crops  and  grassland on
 the low lying riverside. Several large
 farms   are  equipped  with  the  most
 modern    sophisticated     machinery,
 though some medium and small farms are
 not so favoured.  There  are  many old
 field names still in use.Rotten Sykes,
 an ancient flax preparation area, Pong
 Shop, an area once  used as a knackers
 yard, Lock Nine,Wrigglesworth, Pudding
 Poke,  Thrush Church,  Benefield,  The
 Groves,  Seeds field,  Agnestone,  The
 Croft,   Rouths Ochard,   Ottersfield,
 Hall Close, Cliff One, Two and  Three,
 Auden Flatts and Long Marsh.          </content>
