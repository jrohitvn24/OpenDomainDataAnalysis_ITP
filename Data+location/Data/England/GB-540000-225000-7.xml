		<content>  In our area four days a week a van   
 comes round to the door selling meat, 
 fish, milk, eggs and bread. They also 
 sell in other villages. If people want
 to buy other things they would have to
 go in to Buntingford or Bishops       
 Stortford.                            
  There is a post office in the back of
 the old vicerage which is open two    
 afternoons a week. It is soon to be   
 sold and the post office will move to 
 the Star. The letters are delivered   
 twice a day and you can give the      
 postman letters as well. Newspapers   
 are also delivered but not on Sunday. 
  A library van comes round the village
 once a week and you can go inside and 
 choose a book to borrow.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
