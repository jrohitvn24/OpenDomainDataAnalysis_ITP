		<title>08CHANGES IN LADDINGFORD</title>
		<content> UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO LADDINGFORD WAS 
 A SMALL VILLAGE SURROUNDED BY ORCHARDS
 AND HOPFIELDS.MOST OF THE HOUSES IN   
 THE VILLAGE WERE OWNED BY FARMERS AND 
 LIVED IN BY FARM WORKERS AND THEIR    
 FAMILIES WHO WORKED ON THE FARMS.     
 WORK ON THE FARMS HAS NOW CHANGED_    
 MACHINERY AND MODERN FARMING METHODS  
 MEAN THAT FEWER PEOPLE ARE NEEDED.    
 HOUSES IN THE VILLAGE WERE SOLD OFF AS
 FARMERS NO LONGER NEEDED THEM.PEOPLE  
 WHO WORKED IN THE TOWN MOVED INTO THE 
 VILLAGE.                              
 MOST OF THE FARM BUILDINGS ARE NOW    
 BEING CONVERTED INTO HOMES FOR        
 PEOPLE_THE MOST POPULAR ARE OAST      
 HOUSES AND OLD BARNS.                 
 MOST OF THE PEOPLE WORK AWAY FROM THE 
 VILLAGE.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
