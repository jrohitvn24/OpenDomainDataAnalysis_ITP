		<content> There are two C.E. churches in our    
 area and one methodist chapel.The     
 church in Steeple Ashton is St.Mary's 
 and was built in the early 16th       
 century and the church in Keevil is   
 St.Leonard's,and was built in the     
 early 14th century.They both share the
 same vicar.The St.Mary's church is    
 very big as Steeple Ashton used to be 
 a big town,but it became a village    
 after a fire,in the 16th century .The 
 Methodist Chapel shares a minister    
 with other local Methodist Chapels.At 
 one time there used to be a Baptist   
 Chapel in Steeple Ashton:also,starting
 in 1849,a good many people left       
 Steeple Ashton for the U.S.A.where    
 they were able to worship as members  
 of the Mormon Church.Other            
 denominations,mainly R.C and Baptists 
 are catered for in various nearby     
 towns.                                </content>
