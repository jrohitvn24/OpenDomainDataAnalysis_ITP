 children aged 2 to 4. The games differ
 for girls and boys. The most popular  
 game for these children is playing    
{"Mummies and Daddies".}Age 4 to 8,    
 children play{"Kiss Catching".}This is
 when children catch each other to kiss
 them. From 8 to 12,{"String Tig"}is   
 popular. Children play tig and join up
 in a long line when they are caught.  
 From 12 to 14,girls do not play games.
 However,boys play{"Football"}from the 
 age of 4 to 14.                       
   Many games which children play today
 are traditional, such as{"Ring-a-ring}

 "The Black Death" in England in 1368. 
 Clapping games are passed on from past

 children. Many games around today have
