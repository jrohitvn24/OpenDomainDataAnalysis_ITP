		<content> On the sixteenth of July,we went over 
 to Wilmcote vicarage to interview the 
{Vicar of Wilmcote}about his day. He   
 prays to God at 7:25am and then has   
 breakfast and goes to{Holy Communion  
{Service.}He also types letters and    
 checks that every thing is alright.   
 Father Nick likes the job because he  
 goes to see people and gets to know   
 them.He goes to lots of meetings in   
 the evening and sometimes has meetings
 in the day.He decided that he would   
 become a{priest}when he was 11 years  
 old.Father Nick has one day off which 
 is usually Thursday.He likes to finish
 at 9:00pm, but sometimes he is with   
 people until 11:00pm.Father Nick gets 
 paid Â£7,000 a year but he does not    
 have to buy his house.{Father Nick}is 
 39 years old,and has four children.
