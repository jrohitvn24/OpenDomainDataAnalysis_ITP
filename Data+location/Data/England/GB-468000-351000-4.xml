{Southwell. St. Catherine's Well, Holy 
{Well,Lord's Well,}and the{Lady's Well.
{St.Catherine's Well}is supposed to    
 cure{rheumatism. The Lady' Well}was   
 covered up in 1746 because one night a
 man called Mr.Fowler was taking a     
 short cut home through the churchyard.
 It was very dark and he could not see 
 where the well was and suddenly he    
 fell down the well. From that day     
 onwards the well has been covered.
