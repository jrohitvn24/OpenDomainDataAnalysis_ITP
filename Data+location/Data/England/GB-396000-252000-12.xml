		<title>12RECREATION IN AREA</title>
		<content> The only outdoor sports facility in   
 the area is the Flyford Flavell       
 cricket field, loaned to the Club by  
 Mr.James Taylor a local farmer.       
 Cricket, on a wicket of dubious       
 character, takes place there on most  
 weekends.There is a small pavilion but
 tea is hopefully taken outside, often 
 with cider provided by the local inn. 
 The major occupation is obviously     
 gardening with many local people      
 having fine traditional gardens. Many 
 farmers and their children are keen on
 horse riding and there is a strong    
 hunting presence in the area. There   
 being virtually no public facilities, 
 most local people wanting to          
 participate in or watch sporting      
 activities find it necessary to travel
 to local towns. A few locals have     
 their own tennis courts or swimming   
 pools.                                </content>
