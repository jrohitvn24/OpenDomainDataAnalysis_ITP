		<content> Honeychurch consisted of five farms   
 in 1066 and these still exist today,  
 with the same acreage.Their names are 
 Bude;Westacott;Slade;Middletown and   
 Eastown.Near the Old Rectory is Glebe 
 Farm,a more recent addition formed    
 from glebe land.If we take Middletown 
 the nearest to the Chuch,as the       
 Demesne Farm,then the 4 villeins in   
 Domesday lived on Slade,Bude,Westacott
 and Eastown.The name of the Parish    
 comes from Hunas'Church,the estate    
 owner in the 10th.Century.            
  The interior of the tiny church is   
 unchanged from its original state.Wall
 painting can still be seen faintly.   
  Apart from the Farms,there are no    
 other buidings or amenities.          
 Slade Farm contains carving similar to
 that in the church,perhaps as payment 
 for board and lodging for the carver.
