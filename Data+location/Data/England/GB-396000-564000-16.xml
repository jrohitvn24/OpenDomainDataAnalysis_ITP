   Corbridge is an important tourist   
 centre because of the Roman remains at
 Corstopitum,the Saxon church and its  
 shops.In the summer season a tourist  
 information centre operates from the  
 Pele Tower.This arranges accommodation
 for tourists and carries a supply of  
 maps and leaflets for the area.There  
 are 5 hotels in Corbridge and several 
 private houses provide bed and        
 breakfast.During the week many coach  
 tours stop off in Corbridge en route  
 for Scotland and the Roman Wall.As    
 well as British tourists,there  are   
 coaches from Scandinavia,Western      
 Europe and the U.S.A. Several shops   
 sell souvenirs and postcards for the  
 tourists and three cafes and a        
 restaurant cater for their needs.In   
 the summer,local people relax and     
 sunbathe by the riverside.            </content>
