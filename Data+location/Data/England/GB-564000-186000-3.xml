		<title>03LAINDON'S SPECIAL LADY</title>
		<content> She is a lady called Shirley Ellis    
 and she has been chosen Essex Window  
 Cleaner of the year. Her prize was a  
 Â£250 voucher and there is a           
 possibility that she could win a Dacia
 Duster jeep in the final. At the      
 moment Shirley uses a pram to         
 transport her equipment on her rounds.
 She decided to try window cleaning    
 when she lost her job as a home help. 
 She was nominated for her             
 prize by one of her customers who said
 that Shirley is always smiling. She is
 especially kind to old age pensioners.
 She often makes then a cup of tea, and
 charges them less than other people.  
 Her normal charge is Â£1.10.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
