		<content> In addition to modern developments    
 similar to those at Kempshott (see    
 previous page), there are older       
 properties in Oakley such as{Railway  
{Terrace}in Hill Road which was built  
 for railway workers in mid-1800's.    
 Now these are modernised, privately   
 owned and selling for around Â£38,000. 
 Just before the 1939-45 War, a lady   
 living in one of these houses was not 
 able to raise the Â£50 to buy it, being
 asked by the Railway Company. In{St.  
{John's Road,}bungalows built before   
 1940 are being extended and modernised
 by the new owners.                    
 The most select area for houses is    
 along{Pardown}where the larger plots  
 and more rural outlook makes these    
 detached yet older dwellings more     
 sought after. They are mainly of post-
 war comstruction built 1958 - 1983.   
 Prices range from Â£60,000 to Â£120,000.</content>
