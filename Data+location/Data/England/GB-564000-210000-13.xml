   Most of the villages who are of     
working age commute to                 
London,Chelmsford, or Writtle. A number
of people without transport have       
difficulty in getting to work due to   
the inadequate public transport.There  
are also many elderly who live there to
be in a quiet community,but still      
within reach of a large town i.e.      
Chelmsford. There is very little       
unemployment in the area due to, the   
low population. The farms in the area  
employ a few local workers. The        
majority of the women remain at home,  
some involved in voluntary work.       
   The gravel pit employs ten workers  
(all male), but only a few are local,  
most commuting from Chelmsford and one 
from Southend.                         
   The only place where unemployment   
is increasing is Chignal St. James.    </content>
