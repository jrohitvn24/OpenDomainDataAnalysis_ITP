		<title>16RUNNING FOR FUN</title>
		<content> When I woke up in the morning I was   
 nervous. It was the big day &amp; I had to
 run thirteen miles. It was half past  
 ten &amp; I was getting all my gear on.   
 Then I went to Plough Corner. We      
 moved up to the start line. A man held
 a Union Jack flag up &amp; said, On your  
 marks, get set &amp; then he put the flag 
 down.                                 
 We were off!!!                        
 I ran with my two friends and my      
 number was 42. I started off nice &amp;   
 steady &amp; the next thing I knew was    
 that I  had gone 1 mile. On the 5 mile
 mark my legs started to ache. I went  
 passed my house twice &amp; my mum took a 
 picture of me.                        
 Crossing the finishing line was not   
 very nice, but I had made it.         
 I had run the thirteen mile course.
