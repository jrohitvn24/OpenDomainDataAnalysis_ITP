		<title>15THOUGHTS OF A BLYTH FARMER</title>
		<content> My family has farmed here for over 350
 years. My land, covering 436 acres,   
 ranges from 1 to 5 acre fields. I sow 
 winter and spring barley, winter and  
 autumn wheat, oil seed rape, linseed, 
 oats, potatoes and cut grass for hay. 
 My stock consists of Friesian and     
 Hereford bulls. I employ 3 farm hands.
 I enjoy seeing the changing seasons,  
 the interesting and varied work with  
 nature and growing things.The changes 
 I have seen in my lifetime are: horses
 being replaced by tractors, machines  
 taking over the jobs of men,          
 development of seeds which give       
 higher yields but are more susceptible
 to disease resulting in a greater use 
 of fertilisers,chemicals and sprays.  
 A great deal of agricultural land has 
 been taken away for urban use,such as 
 houses, shops and similar amenities.My
 land has lessened as new houses appear</content>
