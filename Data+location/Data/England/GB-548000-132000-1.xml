		<content> Mardens Hill is steep with a good view
 of the{landscape}of woodlands.It is   
 just wide enough for two cars to      
 pass.It is not normally very busy.At  
 the bottom of the hill there is a     
 stream which boys like to play in.A   
 quarter of the way up the hill there  
 is a Nursery.We turn right at friars  
 gate.There are a few cottages before  
 we got to the Half Moon{Pub.}The{road 
 we turn into is not in very good      
 condition and is not wide enough for  
 two cars to pass. There is a boule    
 pitch made with gravel and strips of  
 wood.On the right there is a sign     
 saying that there is a{Sewage Works   
 down the track. We come to a farm     
 called White House Farm.There is lots 
 of farm equipment and tractors for    
 hire and for use on the farm.At the   
 end of the road there are two white   
 farm cottages.                        </content>
