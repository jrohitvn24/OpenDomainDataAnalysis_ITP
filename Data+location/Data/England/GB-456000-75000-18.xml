 The present church was built by Henry 
 Ingram in 1862. It was originally     
 called the High Street Wesleyan       
 Methodist Chapel. It can seat 120     
 people but 200 have been accommodated.
 About 90 people attend the two        
 services during the winter but this   
 rises to 120 during the summer. There 
 is a morning communion service once a 
 month and an evening communion service
 every 3 months. Thirteen years ago the
 Congregational Church joined the      
 Methodist Church to become the United 
 Church. The Minister is the Revd.     
 Raymond Thompson and he has 15        
 officers.He is responsible for 7 other
 churches. There is a Junior Church of 
 approx. 25 children. Mr. Burnett is   
 the organist. The church supports many
 charities and raises money through    
 collections,covenants and bazaars.    </content>
