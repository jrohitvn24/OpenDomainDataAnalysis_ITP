		<title>08Pound Farm, Sandridge</title>
		<content> Pound Farm and Hillend Farm were      
 bought by the Salvation Army in 1923, 
 although there has been a farm on this
 land for at least 400 years.The two   
 farms consist of 928 acres,forming a  
 mixed farm with mainly arable crops   
 but some cattle are kept for beef.The 
 main crops grown are wheat, barley,   
 oats, beans, oil seed rape (used in   
 the manufacture of margarine) and 35  
 acres of grass which is used for hay  
 or sileage. Barley is used to feed the
 cattle,the wheat and oats are sold to 
 a large company which makes breakfast 
 cereals. In 1985 2 tons of wheat were 
 sent to the Ethiopian Famine Appeal.A 
 small part of the land is used as     
 grazing for ten horses. The 70 steers,
 Friesians and cross-bred Angus and    
 Friesians,are kept indoors to avoid   
 being worried by dogs. Protein blocks 
 supplement the cattle's diet.         </content>
