		<title>03A COUNTRY BOYS DAY</title>
		<content>   We are country boys-Joe and Stevie. 
There are good and bad things about    
living in the country.Good things like 
having lots of room to play,being able 
to shoot things,climbing trees,not many
cars around etc.There are lots of nice 
things to see like insects ,birds,     
trees, flowers,hedges,animals etc.We   
like to play games like football,kick  
post,hide and seek,but the bad part is 
there aren't many people to play with. 
We like to go riding our BMX bikes.Joe 
split his tyre on a piece of glass in  
the old pit.It is safe to take your    
dog for a walk.You can grow your own   
food to eat like apples,peas,pears and 
other vegetables.We can go to play with
our friends and relations. Many of our 
friends who live in the village have   
their friends living nearer to them.   
Some boys like to play with girls-we   
don't.                                 </content>
