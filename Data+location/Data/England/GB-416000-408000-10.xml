		<title>10Farming in New Mill Area.</title>
		<content> The area lies near the Eastern slopes 
 of the Pennines. It is a rolling      
 landscape of hills and valleys.The    
 nature of farming in the district is  
 much affected by the height of the    
 land.A good walk around the area on   
 one of the many public foot-paths     
 shows how the vegetation is affected  
 by altitude. The highest land is      
 usually coarse grass with poor soil.As
 you drop into the valley soil becomes 
 richer and the grass improves. On the 
 higher ground there is grazing for    
 sheep.Lower  down we find beef        
 cattle.On the lower valley slopes are 
 dairy herds.In the valley bottom are  
 both dairy herds and some crop        
 growing.The principle crop is often   
 grass for winter fodder.Occasionally  
 specialised farms i.e.pig or poultry  
 farms can be found but these are rare.
