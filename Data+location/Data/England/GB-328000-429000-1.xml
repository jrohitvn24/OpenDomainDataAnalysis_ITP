		<title>01Lytham St. Annes - Overview</title>
		<content>  The area for our survey stretches    
 from Ashton Gardens,Lytham St Annes,to
 Blackpool Airport.                    
 It is an area of open land,water and  
 buildings.                            
 Much of the open land takes the form  
 of sand dunes which border the beach  
 and seashore.In amongst the sand dunes
 are a nature reserve and the St Annes 
 Old Links Golf Club.Much of the area  
 to the west of our survey is open     
 sea,and at low tide many channels and 
 sand banks appear.                    
 The area has many contrasting styles  
 of buildings.There are Victorian      
 houses,very modern houses and small   
 factories.Many of the streets are tree
 lined and facing the sea are          
 apartments and blocks of flats.       
 The area is very popular with visitors
 throughout the year but especially in 
 the summer months.                    </content>
