		<title>15Marwell Zoological Park 1</title>
		<content> The Park was opened in May 1972 in the
 grounds of Marwell Hall.The estate was
 owned by the Seymour family in Tudor  
 times and was described in the        
 Domesday Book.                        
 Mr.J.Knowles was responsible for the  
 original development of the Zoological
 Park.Since 1978 it has been           
 administered as a charitable trust    
 with Mr.Knowles as Director.Its stated
 aims closely parallel his initial     
 ideals:1.To preserve endangered       
 species of animals in captivity and to
 provide animals for rehabilitation to 
 the wild where possible; 2.To educate 
 people about the need for such        
 conservation and to stimulate concern 
 about wild life; 3.To undertake       
 research to improve husbandry in zoos.
