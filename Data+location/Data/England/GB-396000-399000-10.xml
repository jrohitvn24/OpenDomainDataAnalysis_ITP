		<content> or shingles.All the materials were    
 obtained locally,timber from the      
 valley's forest,gritstone was quarried
 locally and sandstone from            
 Dukinfield.The five stone outbuildings
 were rebuilt in the 18th century when 
 some original wattle and daub was     
 replaced by locally made bricks.A     
 cheese press is carved 1719.The hall  
 is part of{Stayley Hall Farm}and is   
 owned by the Stamford Estates who own 
 most of the surrounding land.The hall 
 was lived in till 1912 when the new   
 farmhouse was built.It is now         
 derelict.Much of the groundfloor has  
 been used as a cattle shed.When its   
 future was reviewed in 1975 there     
 seemed to be nobody willing to        
 preserve the building."It is damp and 
 rotten.Slates are falling.Timber is   
 rotting.Bushes are sprouting,living   
 birds are nesting-people are long gone</content>
