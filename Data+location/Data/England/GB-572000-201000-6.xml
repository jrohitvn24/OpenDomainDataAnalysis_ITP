		<content>   In the garden there is a big fish   
 pond with two filter beds. There is a 
 net over the pond to keep out the     
 birds and cats.                       
   At the nursery, about three people  
 work there and they enjoy their work  
 very much. One of them has worked     
 there for five years.                 
   They do not plant seeds when they   
 need new plants they use cuttings from
 the bigger plants. This is what they  
 do, they take off the two bottom      
 leaves and then snip beneath the node 
 and put them into larger pots so that 
 they have more root space to grow.
