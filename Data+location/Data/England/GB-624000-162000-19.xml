		<title>19FARMING</title>
		<content> A Farmer at Stourmouth has 800 acres, 
 some of orchard, the rest cereals and 
 vegetables in rotation. Newest 'break'
 crop is{Oil Seed rape.}He keeps no    
 stock, although his father had many   
 sheep. The land here (brickearth over 
 sand) is so good it is wasted as      
 pasture. His farm is totally          
 mechanised with few workers and a 40  
 hour week.{Changes:}The farm is a     
 combination of 8 smaller farms which  
 employed many more workers. They were 
 market garden, hops, orchard, and soft
 fruit farms. Hopfields have           
 disappeared from the area, but        
{orchards remain}as the soil is ideal  
 for fruit trees. Old orchards are     
 being grubbed out to make room for new
 kinds of fruit, the trees planted so  
 as to make{mechanised picking         
 possible. Farmers regret some changes 
 but find them economically inevitable.</content>
