		<title>02RIVER ORWELL</title>
		<content>  The River Orwell flows from Ipswich  
to the North Sea at Felixstowe and     
Harwich. It is used by commercial ships
bringing cargoes to and from Ipswich   
Docks. The channel was dredged in      
World War II. Until then lighters went 
out to big ships, anchored below Pin   
Mill, to take off some of the cargo so 
that the ships could rise and be able  
to sail up to Ipswich. The river on    
each side of the channel is now used   
for yacht moorings. In the summer the  
River is full of yachts and sailing    
dinghies. There is still a little      
commercial fishing in the river. The   
mud and saltings on the river banks    
provide winter feeding grounds for a   
wide variety of migrant and wading     
birds. There is a little wild-fowling. 
The woods that are on both shores make 
the Orwell a very attractive river.
