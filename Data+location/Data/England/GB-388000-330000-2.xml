		<title>02PIREHILL FIRST SCHOOL</title>
		<content>Address: Tilling Drive, Walton, Stone. 
Age of pupils: 5 to 9 years.           
  There are over 200 children in our   
school and 38 children in Class 6. 15  
of the older ones will be leaving in   
July and going on to Walton Priory     
Middle School in September. The others 
will go into Class 7 at our school.    
  This is what we think of our school: 
The uniform at our school is very smart
It is blue and grey. If a school       
doesn't have a uniform it doesn't seem 
like a proper school to me. Each class 
is different. Each class is interesting
At our Summer Fete there were stalls   
and sideshows, a gymnastic display and 
a fancy dress competition. We are work-
ing for a water safety award from the  
Royal Life Saving Society. This is very
important because we are near a very   
fast flowing river.
