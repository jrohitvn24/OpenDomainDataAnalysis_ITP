		<title>01A general account of Ripe</title>
		<content>      The village of Ripe is a small   
 community between the towns of        
 Lewes,Hailsham and Polegate in East   
 Sussex. It is reached by C roads, some
 of which are very narrow. It is       
 therefore quiet and peaceful. The area
 lies between the A21 London to        
 Eastbourne road and the A 27 Lewes to 
 Polegate road.                        
      To the South at a distance of 2  
 miles from the boundary of the block  
 are the South Downs, made of chalk.   
 The North Downs are 20 miles distant  
 and the plain in between is the Sussex
 Weald. The soil is mostly clay but a  
 ridge of sandstone overlays it through
 Ripe. This makes the area good farming
 country.                              
      There are some 100 dwelligs in   
 the area mostly in Ripe but a few in  
 the nearby villages of Calvington and 
 Firle.                                </content>
