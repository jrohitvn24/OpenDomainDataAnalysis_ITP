		<title>20FARMING AROUND GREENSIDE</title>
		<content> The area around Greenside is mainly a 
 farming area. It is quite close to    
 Tyneside so many farmers keep some    
 dairu cattle to sell their milk. Most 
 of the milk from the farms around here
 goes to the creamery at Blaydon. This 
 means that quite a large area of      
 farmland is used for pasture or for   
 growing hay which is fed to the nimals
 in winter.                            
 The farmers also keep beef cattle and 
 sheep to sell at the local markets of 
 Newcastle, Hexham and Ponteland.      
 During the winter the farmers also use
 the hay they have grown to feed these 
 animals.                              
 The main crop grown in this area is   
 barley, which is usually the winter   
 variety.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
