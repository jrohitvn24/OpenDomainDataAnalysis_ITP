		<title>16CORNISH LANGUAGE PLACE NAMES</title>
		<content> Many of the places in our survey area 
 have names which are derived from the 
 Cornish language.This often helps to  
 explain the origins of the village or 
 settlement or describes the natural   
 features of the landscape or  some    
 special association with a person or  
 event. Some of the place names are    
 still in the Cornish language,while   
 others are in English,usually in a    
 corrupt form.Despite the efforts of   
 many people in recent years,Cornish   
 remains a language mainly for         
 antiquarians and is only commonly seen
 in the place names throughout the     
 area.On the next page of text we have 
 recorded a list of some of the place  
 names in our survey area, together    
 with their meanings.
