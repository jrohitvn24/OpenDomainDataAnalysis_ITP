		<title>13 POLLUTION IN ROCK FERRY</title>
		<content>{Pollution}in our area is of several   
 tyes. {The River Mersey}is polluted   
 with oil, petrol and other chemicals  
 from factories and ships.  I once saw 
 lumps of fat in the river which came  
 from a margarine factory.  There are  
 no fish in the river near us because  
 of this.  Another type of{pollution is
{caused by lead.  We have high levels  
{of lead dust found in our school yard.
  Two things could have caused this.   
 One thing could be a by-pass, carrying
 heavy traffic, built right next to the
 school.  Lead from exhaust fumes is   
 blown into the school.  The other     
 thing is that the school was built in 
 1932 and was once painted with{lead   
{paint. }Flakes of the old paint could 
 have fallen into the yard.  The yard  
 has to be hosed down in dry weather to
 keep the dust down.
