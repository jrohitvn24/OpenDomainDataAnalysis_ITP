 instruments and march about.As our    
 special dress uniform we wear{red     
{jackets with red,white,and blue       
{skirts.}We have won lots of prizes,   
 badges,and trophies.Our group has only
 been formed 5 years and we've already 
 bought our own bus.                   
 The instruments we play are drums,    
 glockenspiels,cymbals and tambourines.
 We know all sorts of songs,Eye Level, 
 My Grandfathers Clock, A Walk Through 
 The Black Forest and Annie's Song,to  
 name but a few.We all pay 50p each    
 week and Â£7.50 for the uniform.The    
 committee,made up of mums,organises   
 money raising efforts to help with the
 cost of running the group. We are lead
 by a{Mace Bearer}who walks at the     
 head of the group and keeps us        
 marching in time to the music.        </content>
