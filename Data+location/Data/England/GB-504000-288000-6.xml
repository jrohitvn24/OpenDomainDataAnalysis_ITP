		<content> .../... Some boys take the school's   
 own special test.                     
   Oundle School has eleven boarding - 
 houses, each of which is supervised by
 a Housemaster who is also a member of 
 the teaching staff. The school also   
 has a beautiful chapel built in the   
 1920's and a Great Hall used for      
 lectures, assemblies and other events.
 The school is particularly well-known 
 for its science and engineering       
 courses, having been one of the first 
 major public schools to widen its     
 curriculum from the previously narrow 
 classical base. Each boy is expected  
 to take an average of nine 'O'-levels 
 and three 'A'-levels after which many 
 enter universities. Oundle School     
 students regularly achieve places at  
 Oxford and Cambridge, which shows     
 the importance attached to academic   
 success.                              </content>
