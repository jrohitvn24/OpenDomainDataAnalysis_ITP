		<content> Both Dringhouses and Woodthorpe are   
 residential areas therefore residents 
 have few means of entertainment and   
 must go the four miles into York for  
 theatre, dance hall, cinema and main  
 restaurants.                          
 There is not a lot to do at night but 
 there is a large swimming pool,the{   
{Edmund Wilson Baths,} and an indoor   
 bowls club opposite the baths.        
 There are open areas where football   
 and outdoor games can be played.      
 There is a childrens play area beside 
 the shops on the village green and a  
 small football pitch in Woodthorpe.   
                                       
 The York racecourse is a popular      
 meeting place for regular horse       
 racing. It has at least twenty five   
 meetings a year and has been visited  
 in recent years by Her Majesty the    
 Queen.                                </content>
