		<content> It takes three weeks to train a blind 
 person to be able to handle a dog.They
 get the money from the public by      
 donations.There are 63 staff.Some live
 at the centre and some are            
 part_time.There are a hundred         
 puppy_walkers in the North West and   
 seven hundred and  seventy guide dogs 
 which Nuffield House are responsible  
 for, up to 120 dogs in the centre and 
 650 working dogs in the area.The      
 average age for retiring is 10 to     
 11,but if the dog is ill it will      
 retire early.If a dog fails its test  
 it will be offered to a puppy_walker  
 or the public as a pet.The centre has 
 3 baths one of which is an isolation  
 block.They have a food store they give
 the dogs mostly tinned food,but       
 sometimes they get raw meat.The most  
 popular dogs to train are golden      
 labradors.                            </content>
