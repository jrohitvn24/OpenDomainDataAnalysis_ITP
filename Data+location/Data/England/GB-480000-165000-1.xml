 Wokingham. One of{attractive scenery: 
 extensive pinewoods and rhododendrons 
 flourishing in light sandy soil. The  
 north-western part contains a small   
{industrial estate}while the north-east
 is mainly{agricultural}with older type
 houses and cottages, some dating from 
 16th and 17th centuries.The rest of   
 the area consists mostly of{market-   
{gardening}farms with the major housing
 areas in the eastern section - most   
 houses built after 1950.{New housing  
{estates}are now being built and some  
 of the pinewoods are disappearing.    
 Large houses built in the 19th century
 are now used as schools or have been  
 converted into flats.To the south lies
 part of the eccliastical parish of    
 St.Sebastian's. There is a small      
 church erected in 1864:beside it the
