		<title>02The North Hants Ridgeway</title>
		<content> The North Hants Ridgeway is part of   
 the Wayfarer's Walk. This is an       
 ancient track on a high chalk ridge   
 running through the south of this     
 area.The track can be followed from   
 Basingstoke to the Vale of Pewsey in  
 Wiltshire where it joins the Great    
 Ridgeway. This ancient road was used  
 by Neolithic men who lived in this    
 country 2,000 B.C. and by Britons,    
 Romans, and Saxons. In the Middle Ages
 it was still a main road from East to 
 West.Today it is just a green track   
 used by many walkers who enjoy the    
 spectacular views and the many        
 species of wild flowers which are in  
 danger of becoming extinct.
