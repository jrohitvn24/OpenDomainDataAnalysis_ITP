		<title>14A WOOLSTON CHILD'S DAY</title>
		<content>   One Day In My Life by Clare Snow    
     (A Woolston child aged 11)        
                                       
   On Saturday morning I woke at 8am. I
 dragged myself out of bed and had a   
 quick shower. I took the dog out to   
 the local park. After breakfast I     
 grabbed my coat and purse and went to 
 town with mum and dad. We looked at   
 shops and had a drink at the coffee   
 shop. After buying some cheese at the 
 market we went home. After a rushed   
 dinner I called for a friend and we   
 went to see Mr Fisher who lives at the
 old persons' home (Woolston Hall). We 
 stayed about an hour then decided to  
 go swimming. We liked the inflatable  
 dragon in the pool! Later I put on my 
 Guide uniform and helped at the old   
 people's party. I got home at 9.20,   
 watched a film then went to bed.
