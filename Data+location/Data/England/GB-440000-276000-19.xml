		<title>19THE THATCHER, NR. COVENTRY.</title>
		<content>   The thatcher lives in a picturesque 
 cottage in Rugby Road, Brandon, with  
 his wife and two teenage children.

   He learnt his trade from an old man 
 in Northamptonshire. He has been      
 thatching for about fifteen years. It 
 takes him about six to eight weeks to 
 thatch an average sized cottage but it
 can take a lot longer. He is one of   
 only a very few thatchers in the area.
 He has a young apprentice who is      
 learning this dying art.

   The thatcher uses three different   
 materials. He uses two straw varieties
 or thatch, one called long straw and  
 one called combed wheat. He also uses 
 Norfolk reed. In the past he has used 
 rice straw, marsh sedge and heather.
