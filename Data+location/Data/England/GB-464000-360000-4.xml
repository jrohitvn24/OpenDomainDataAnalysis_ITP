		<title>04EDUCATION IN EAKRING</title>
		<content> Up to 1964 Eakring had its own school,
 the closing of it was very sad for the
 village. Having a school in the       
 village the children grow up much     
 closer which means everything to a    
 community. In 1985 Eakring is very    
 split educationally with children     
 bussing to Bilsthorpe for the infants 
 and juniors and Rufford Comp for      
 seniors. A lot of parents prefer to   
 send their children to other village  
 schools such as Kneesall and          
 Kirklington, or Private schools in    
 Edingley and Wellow upto 11 yrs and to
 Minster School at Southwell,          
 Nottingham High School and Privately  
 at Worksop College. There is a        
 combined churches Sunday School and a 
 Youth Club for the teenages which help
 to bring the different groups         
 together.
