		<content> Sport is a major interest. There are 2
 public tennis courts. The football    
 club has a good ground and plays      
 regular matches. The school has a     
 small sports field including jumping  
 pits. The childrens recreation ground 
 has swings, slide and roundabout.     
 There are regular trips to Swindon and
 Marlborough for swimming. Golfers go  
 to Ogbourne or Marlborough. There is  
 some shooting at clays and vermin.    
 Walking often with children and dogs  
 is popular either on local paths or   
 after a car journey to areas where    
 there are country parks or open down- 
 land. Most houses have gardens and    
 this provides interest, exercise and  
 food. This and the weather provide a  
 constant source of conversation. Front
 gardens, flower baskets and tubs give 
 pleasure to visitors and enjoyable    
 competition between neighbours        </content>
