		<title>10LODGE CARR FARM DONCASTER</title>
		<content> I sometimes get fed up with my home   
 life. My friends rarely visit because 
 they would have to walk over a mile.  
 Since I was born 14 years ago I have  
 only had one full weeks holiday       
 because we cannot leave the cows. Then
 again it is peaceful with only the    
 sounds of birds, tractors and animals.
   Our dairy farm in Loversall is very 
 wet because it is low down: 5 feet    
 below sea level in places. It can be  
 hot and dry in summer but in winter   
 nearly all our fields are partly      
 flooded.                              
   I help to fetch the cows in and milk
 them. We have about 30 cows but last  
 year when the milk quotas came in we  
 were told to produce 9% less than 1983
 and as we were flooded then we didn't 
 send in as much as usual. We had hoped
 to be farming 100 cows with someone on
 contract to milk them.                </content>
