		<content>  This block comprises a rural area of 
 the{Lower Culm Valley}and includes the
 village of{Uffculme.}The river{Culm}  
 runs through the centre and the main  
 land use is for grazing of cattle  and
 sheep. There are also two             
 areas of quarry land which are owned  
 by{E.C.C. Quarries Ltd.}These provide 
 considerable local employment and they
 also own much of the land adjacent to 
 the existing quarry areas. There are  
 also several light industries in the  
 area and these are mentioned in some  
 detail later.{Uffculme}itself is      
 undergoing considerable growth at     
 present. There is a fairly high       
 proportion of council housing but the 
 most recent growth has been of small  
 private estates. With the{M5 motorway 
 and{North Devon Link Road}nearby many 
 people commute and this may increase  
 when{Tiverton Parkway}opens in 1987.  </content>
