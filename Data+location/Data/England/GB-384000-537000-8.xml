		<content> Only 2 or 3 farmers now produce milk, 
 sending it to the Milk Marketing Board
 or selling it retail. Others have     
 suckler calves which run with their   
 mothers. Milk cows are mainly Fries-  
 ian.Suckler calves include pure Her-  
 efords and Hereford-,Charolais-, Lim- 
 ousin- and Friesian- crosses. Artif-  
 icial insemination is used on some    
 farms. Calves are sold at 8mths-1yr   
 old, store cattle at 18mths-2yrs. At  
 St.Johns Chapel Auction Mart in 1985  
 a Charolais cross heifer calf made    
 Â£750 and a first prize bullock Â£445.  
 Buyers came from Bishop Auckland,     
 Durham, Cleveland and York. Silage and
 hay are made for winter fodder. Most  
 farmers now favour giant bales wrapped
 in plastic and stored outside. Hay    
 making is highly mechanised. Many     
 farmers use 3 wheeled Honda motor-    
 cycles to travel about their land.    </content>
