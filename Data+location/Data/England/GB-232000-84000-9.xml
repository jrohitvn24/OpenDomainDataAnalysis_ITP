		<title>09A LOCAL TRUCK DRIVER'S DAY</title>
		<content> My dad gets up at 4.30 a.m. After a   
 mug of coffee and cereal for breakfast
 he leaves the house by car.On arriving
 at the depot in{Holsworthy,}he checks 
 in and sets off for work in the truck.
 From Launceston he travels to Exeter  
 Plymouth, Tavistock, St Austell and   
 Truro. His job is collecting{eggs}from
 local farms and taking them to the    
{depot.}He drives either a 16 ton Ford 
 Cargo or an E.R.F. and carries 4000   
 eggs in dozen boxes. At the back is   
 a loading lift to raise 1000 Kg. In   
 the cab is his C.B.radio and another  
 radio. When it is lunch-time, he has a
 snack lunch in the cab. In the        
 afternoon he continues his rounds and 
 usually finishes about 5 p.m.Mum finds
 the{micro-wave}cooker useful to cook  
 his meals quickly when he arrives. He 
 has very little leisure time as he    
 goes to bed early.                    </content>
