		<content> Mrs. Pickard interview continued.     
                                       
 She thought that the Earl and Countess
 were very nice and very strict.  She  
 can remember the Duke and Duchess of  
 Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth     
 coming to stay at Castle Hill.        
 Mrs. Pickard remembers travelling on  
 the Filleigh railway and went as far  
 as Reading and London.  She also got  
 around on foot and by bicycle when she
 was young.                            
                                       
        Lady Margaret Fortescue        
 Lady Margaret recalls that it was too 
 expensive to go to school, so until   
 the age of fifteen she had a          
 governess.  Then she went to finishing
 school in Switzerland.  She also went 
 to school in England until the age of 
 eighteen.
