		<title>01The Hoyland Common area.</title>
		<content> Our area contains four distinct but   
 related communities.These are Hoyland 
 Common;Birdwell;Tankersley;and Pilley.
 They surrounding countryside is a     
 peculiar mix of the rural and the     
 industrial.                           
 Hoyland Common is part of a continuous
 development which includes Hoyland and
 Elsecar.It has many services and both 
 old and new housing developments.Most 
 of its inhabitants work in either     
 Barnsley or Sheffield.                
 Birdwell is a sizable village,        
 originallly a ribbon development,on   
 the main Sheffield - Barnsley         
 road.Again most of its residents work 
 elsewhere.                            
 Pilley and Tankersley are small mining
 villages,although the mines they      
 served are now closed down.Close by a 
 new industrial estate,the Wentworth   
 Estate has been built.                </content>
