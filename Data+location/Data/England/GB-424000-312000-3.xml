		<content>   Some farms have been made larger by 
 amalgamation with others bordering    
 onto the area. This process has       
 resulted in the removal of hedges and 
 trees to create larger fields. The    
 equipment used by the modern farmers  
 also demand vast areas for turning    
 and so the traditional smaller fields 
 are unsuitable.                       
   A survey carried out to investigate 
 field size proved that the amalgamated
 farms had enlarged their fields to a  
 greater extent. Sizes ranged from 16  
 to 38 acres per field. On the smaller 
 farms the average field size was about
 10 acres. In such cases farmers were  
 reluctant to remove hedges because of 
 its effect on the wildlife and general
 appearance of the area.
