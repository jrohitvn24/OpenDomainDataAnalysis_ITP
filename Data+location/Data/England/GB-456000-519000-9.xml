 said one man.Most people see the job  
 situation getting worse before it gets
 better.Most people thought that       
 smoking was a very expensive habit    
 which was bad for your health.People  
 all agreed that there was far too much
 famine and it was a very sad situation

 I.C.I. Wilton provided an awful lot of
 the pollution in the area.Despite     
 spending over 1 million pounds a year 
 on pollution control Lazonby village  
 was a smokeless area as one person    
 complained."It's not fair,here we are 
 smokeless and there's all those       
 fumes coming from I.C.I. Wilton."In   
 the area people wanted things such as 
 hospitals,youth clubs and more        
 shops,they all felt that these        
 would make the villages better places.</content>
