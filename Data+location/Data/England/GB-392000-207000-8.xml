		<content>   This aspect of the Miserden Estate  
 Farming is concerned with the rearing 
 of{pheasants}as game birds. The work  
 is carried out by the{Gamekeeper}and  
 two assistants.                       
   About{10,000 birds}are reared       
 between May and August.They start in  
 special pens and are fed three times a
 day. Later in the year feed points in 
 the woods are set up together with    
 straw which is to draw the birds to   
 the area of the drive.                
  {The shoot covers 15 days in November
 and the days' shooting is kept very   
 much as a private concern of the Wills
 family.7 days can be bought by outside
 concerns e.g. French banking companies
 or American groups.                   
   Each 'gun' receives a complimentary 
{brace,}most of the birds being sold to
 game dealers for later sale in shops.
