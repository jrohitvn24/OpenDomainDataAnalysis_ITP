 Trees found in the wood are Japanese  
 Birch, American Fir, Ash, Beech       
 English Oak, Cherry, Sweet Chestnut,  
 Horse Chestnut, Spruce, Austrian Pine,
 Holly, Hazel, Willow, Elder, Birch,   
 European Silver Birch Crab Apple, and 
 Hawthorne.                            
  The rarest flower in the wood is the 
 Blue Marsh Orchid.                    
  More common flowers and shrubs       
 include: Red Campian, Dog Rose,       
 Forget-Me-Not, Yellow Hawkweed,       
 Honeysuckle and the White Campian.    
  The gamekeeper dislikes spraying     
 because it not only kills the plants  
 which are a nuisanse,but also the     
 rarer wild plants.  He also tries to  
 preserve shrubs and trees,such as the 
 Wild Rose which many gamekeepers cut  
 down.
