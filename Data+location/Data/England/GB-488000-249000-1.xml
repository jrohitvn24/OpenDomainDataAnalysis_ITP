		<content> The Ouse, meanders between the market 
 town of Olney - famous for its annual 
 pancake race against Liberal, USA -   
 and the villages of Emberton and      
 Clifton Reynes.   The outskirts of    
 Newton Blossomville, the hamlet of    
 Petsoe End and scattered farms form   
 the only other settlements.   The east
 is predominantly agricultural land    
 with mixed farming an the clay fields 
 which slope to the gravel terraces    
 along the river.   The local limestone
 is to be seen in all older buildings. 
 Emberton Park with its series of lakes
 was the first such country park;      
 created by landscaping a site         
 following gravel extraction for the   
 M1.   People travel to work in Milton 
 Keynes, Northampton, Bedford and      
 further afield.   There is employment 
 in Olney in shops, businesses and     
 light industry.   Olney's association </content>
