		<content>  The Brownies meet on Monday. They    
 have not always been called Brownies. 
 When it first started the girls called
 themselves the Roses. The name was    
 changed when the Roses got unhappy    
 with their name and Baden_Powell told 
 them the story of Tommy and Betty,    
 then the name was changed to Brownies.
  The Brownies meet from 6.00pm to 7.30
 pm in the Village Hall. There are 22  
 Brownies some of them arent enrolled  
 yet. They have got 1 Brown Owl, 2     
 Guides. 1 Helper, and 1 Young Leader. 
 They have a pack holiday every year,  
 and loads of Fundays and Fetes.At     
 Brownies they play games like, Traffic
 lights, Hospital beds,running and     
 stuck in the mud. They also sing      
 campfire songs, make sweets, have     
 coffee evenings and make things like  
 the Union Jack. By Caroline Stansfield
 and Sarah Preston.                    </content>
