		<title>04TRAFFIC IN HIGH WYCOMBE</title>
		<content>  Until recently,the{A40,}linking      
{London to Oxford}and passing through  
 High Wycombe's town centre bore most  
 of the traffic, frquently bringing    
 the town to a stand still.In{1967}work
 was started to constuct a{relief road,
 from Oxford Road in the west, over the
 precint to the A40 in Easton Street.  
 This has relieved traffic in Frogmoor 
 and the High Street. Then a new       
 motorway, the{M40,}was built,allowing 
 much of the traffic to by-pass High   
 Wycombe.                              
  The main{A404}leads North to{Amersham
 and beyond,while,to the South,{Marlow 
 Hill links the centre of town with the
 new{M40}motorway between{London}and   
{Oxford.}High Wycombe is also linked by
{rail}to London. Thus, High Wycombe is 
 in a good situation, having good road 
 links with London, the South East,the 
 West and the Midlands.                </content>
