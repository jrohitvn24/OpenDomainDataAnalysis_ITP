		<title>18Our school in the 30's</title>
		<content> Mr.Toms came to this school in the    
 30's, when the boys &amp; girls were      
 separated in the playgrounds. The boys
 wore hobnail boots &amp; caps, &amp; the girls
 wore wool stockings.                  
  There were no school dinners,trips or
 parties &amp; lessons were different to   
 today's. Maths was mostly arithmetic, 
 with times tables &amp; long division.    
 They did lots of History &amp; Singing    
 with the headmaster, who wrote a      
 school song. They had to learn long   
 poems &amp; Bible passages,&amp; girls did    
 cookery, &amp; boys did woodwork. The best
 at each subject were given prizes.    
  Discipline was strict but fair.      
 They played with tops, hoops, marbles 
 &amp; cigarette cards, &amp; every week the   
 boys would play football, &amp; the girls 
 played stoolball.                     
  Mr. Toms says his favourite lesson   
 was singing.                          </content>
