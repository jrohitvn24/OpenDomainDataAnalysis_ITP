		<title>12E.Hoathly Carnival Society</title>
		<content> This society is one of the most       
 active. It has approximately one hund-
 red paid up members. Each year it org-
 anises a Bonfire Night Celebration in 
 memory of all those killed in the     
 wars. The climax of this exciting     
 evening is a huge firework spectacu-  
 lar. Preparations take a whole year   
 and the theme is a closely guarded    
 secret. During the evening there is a 
 procession. The society members dress 
 as North American Indians or as       
 Cowboys. People make their own        
 costumes. Many other Carnival Societ- 
 ies, in their colourful costumes, join
 the parade with the visting bands to  
 add to the atmosphere. Approximately  
 9000 people attend and the money      
 raised goes to charity. On the        
 following Sunday members parade and   
 attend a special Rememberance Day     
 Service at the Village Church.        </content>
