		<title>09INDUSTRIAL SITES OF W. HULL</title>
		<content>  THIS AREA WAS, UNTIL RECENTLY, A     
 RESIDENTIAL AREA, BUILT AROUND THE    
 THREE MAIN ROADS INTO HULL. BECAUSE OF
 THE CONSIDERABLE DECLINE OF THE       
 FISHING INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS, MANY
 AREAS OF HESSLE ROAD HAVE BEEN        
 DEMOLISHED, AND REPLACED, IN PARTS, BY
 SMALL INDUSTRIAL SITES.               
  THESE SITES WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE USE 
 OF THE NEARLY CONSTRUCTED SOUTH       
 ORBITAL ROAD WHICH RUNS PARALLEL TO   
 THE HUMBER. THERE ARE THREE INDUSTRIAL
 SITES WITHIN THE DESIGNATED AREA:     
 ST.ANDREWS PRIORY SIDINGS, HAWTHORNE  
 AVENUE UNIT, DAIRYCOATES AND          
 GIPSYVILLE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE. THE     
 RANGE OF BUSINESSES IS CONSIDERABLE,  
 COMPRISING OF MANUFACTURING UNITS,    
 SERVICE INDUSTRIES, ADVERTISING, FOOD 
 AND REPAIR SERVICES.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
