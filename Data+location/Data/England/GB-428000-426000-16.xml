		<title>16Priestley's Farm.</title>
		<content> The farm has all sorts of animals and 
 this includes the following:          
 horses,pigs,cows,hens,geese,dogs,a    
 donkey and some goldfish in a well.   
 The Priestley's have been there for   
 almost eight years and paid out for   
 the farm because they loved           
 animals.The first thing they did was  
 to build a new house.                 
 The family do not employ anyone to    
 help run the farm as it is a family   
 concern.The farm does not grow crops  
 of any description and depend on the  
 animals.                              
 Furthermore,the family has built 12   
 stables and the children enter horses 
 in shows.Henry Priestley told us that 
 there used to be a farm here 200 years
 ago and that it was farmed alot during
 the last war.
