		<title>10THE INN AT PORCHFIELD</title>
		<content> The Sportsman's Rest is a public house
 and situated in the middle of         
 Porchfield.It was first built of      
 Island stone in 1598 as a hunting     
 lodge and became a pub in 1870.The    
 present landlord,Mel Clarke,is the    
 seventeenth since that date and there 
 have been many changes in the bars    
 too.The most popular pub sport at     
 present is pool.There are 5 players in
 the team and they play in the Cowes   
 and district Pool League.Darts is not 
 as popular as it was and the pub no   
 longer has a darts team.The Juke box  
 is very popular and always has the top
 forty records on it.The Porchfield    
 cricket team uses the pub after it's  
 matches which are played a short      
 distance away.In September the locals 
 challenge the Cricket Team to a fun   
 match which is enjoyed by all.
