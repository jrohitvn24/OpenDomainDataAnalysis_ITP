		<title>18EDUCATION IN SPENNITHORNE</title>
		<content> THE PRIMARY SCHOOL FOR THIS AREA IS   
 SPENNITHORNE C.E. PRIMARY SCHOOL.IT IS
 AN OLD BUILDING. IT WAS BUILT IN 1833 
 AND HASN'T CHANGED MUCH APART FROM THE
 ADDITION OF A CANTEEN, A PORTOKABIN   
 AND NEW STORAGE HEATERS INSTEAD OF    
 COKE STOVES.(FIVE YEARS AGO)          
  AT THE AGE OF 11 THE PUPILS LEAVE    
 SPENNITHORNE SCHOOL AND GO UP TO THE  
 WENSLEYDALE SCHOOL AT LEYBURN. SOME   
 GO TO THE RICHMOND SCHOOL 9 MILES     
 AWAY. THE WENSLEYDALE SCHOOL IS A VERY
 MODERN BUILDING.MANY YOUNG PEOPLE GO  
 ON TO COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY TO FINISH 
 THEIR EDUCATION.                      
  UNFORTUNATELY JOB PROSPECTS ARE VERY 
 POOR AT THE MOMENT.THERE IS NOT VERY  
 MUCH INDUSTRY AND FARMERS DON'T EMPLOY
 AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY USED TO. SOME  
 PEOPLE FIND WORK AT CATTERICK GARRISON
 EIGHT MILES AWAY.                     
                                       </content>
