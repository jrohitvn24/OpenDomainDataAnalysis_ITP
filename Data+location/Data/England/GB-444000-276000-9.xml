    Additional amenities consist of: a 
 garage, a telephone box, a public     
 house, a church, a dove cote, a       
 village green and a small school.     
    Running between the villages is the
 River Avon. Just beside this are some 
 attractive fish ponds. One of these is
 used by anglers and yields fish such  
 as Carp, Bream, Rudd, Roach, Perch and
 Sticklebacks. The two other ponds have
 been left stagnent since their former 
 use as healing spas in the 17th       
 century.

    The job situation here is virtually
 identical to that of Long Lawford.
