		<content>   THREE LOCAL FIRMS ARE NOW WELL      
ESTABLISHED ON THIS SITE ENGAGED IN    
SHEETMETAL FABRICATION.THE LARGEST     
EMPLOYER,WILLSHER AND QUICK,WAS SET UP 
IN THE 1950'S BY TWO LOCAL MEN WHO SAW 
THE NEED FOR THE FABRICATION OF METAL  
ENCLOSURES.FROM THESE SMALL BEGININGS, 
THE FIRM HAS GROWN TO BECOME THE SECOND
LARGEST LOCAL EMPLOYER.NOT ONLY IS THE 
FABRICATION CARRIED OUT,BUT ALSO THE   
MANUFACTURED GOODS ARE DELIVERED IN THE
FIRMS OWN LORRIES.                     
   FIVE YEARS AGO,TWO SMALLER FIRMS    
OPENED TO CARRY OUT SIMULAR WORK.THESE 
HAVE BOTH BECOME WELL ESTABLISHED AND  
HAVE INCREASED THEIR WORK FORCE.       
   PRECISION ENGINEERING TAKES PLACE IN
A SMALL WORKSHOP FOR A BIRMINGHAM      
MANUFACTURER HERE,EXPENSIVE METALS ARE 
FABRICATED INTO PARTS FOR CHEMICAL     
ENGINEERING.
