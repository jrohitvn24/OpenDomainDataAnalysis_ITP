		<content> In our area there is a railway line   
 running from Bristol to Birmingham. It
 crosses the canal. There used to be a 
 station until the 1930's. The station 
 house is still standing today; it is  
 said to have the old waiting room     
 still intact. The line is used by     
 express  trains travelling from the   
 West Country to the North-East of     
 England. Famous trains of the past,   
 such as the "Devonian", roared by to  
 climb the Lickey Incline a little     
 further on, aided by steam banking    
 engines such as the Midland Railway   
 Company's "Big Bertha". Present day   
 diesel hauled trains and Inter-City   
 High Speed Trains do not need help,   
 travelling much faster. The line is   
 busy and several trains pass up and   
 down every hour,both passenger and    
 freight.                              
                                       </content>
