On Friday nights I go to Guides.We play
lots of different games. The best game 
is called Flags. We get ourselves into 
groups and take turns to find the flag 
of the country called out by our Cap-  
tain. We then have to go back to our   
group and tell them the colours of the 
flag. One week at Guides we all made   
bird's puddings.But when I hung mine in
my garden, none of the birds had any!

I swim at Crystal Palace which is an   
international sports centre. There are 
four swimming pools. There are lessons 
for people to learn to swim and dive.In
the racing pool they have a large part 
for the public to use. I am working for
my gold award and can swim 16 lengths.
