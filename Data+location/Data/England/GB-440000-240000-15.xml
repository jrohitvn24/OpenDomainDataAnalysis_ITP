		<title>15Walks starting from Wroxton.</title>
		<content>This area of the project is covered in 
the main by fields with the exception  
of part of the western edge of Banbury 
town and Wroxton village. In this      
beautiful area the County Council has  
created two main circular walks in     
addition to numerous other footpath    
routes. Both of these start from       
Wroxton village, one going north and   
west to the villages of Horley,        
Hornton, Alkerton, Shenington and      
Balscott. This route is about ten      
miles. A shorter walk goes south       
towards North Newington and then east  
before returning to Wroxton along the  
edge of the Bretch Hill estate in      
Banbury. Both routes give the walker   
the opportunity to see the abundant    
wild life in the area as well as a     
number of typical North Oxfordshire    
villages with their thatched houses    
built in the local brown ironstone.    </content>
