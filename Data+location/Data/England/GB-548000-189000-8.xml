		<title>08COMMUNITY CENTRE - N.ROMFORD</title>
		<content>  The Community Centre was built in    
 November, 1965. The land where the    
 centre is was a row of Collier's      
 houses, a forest and then an adventrue
 playground. The council and the       
 Community Association paid for it to  
 be built. Most of the staff are       
 volunteers,but the caretaker and      
 cleaning ladies get paid. They get up 
 to 17,000 visitors a year and betwen  
 60 and 80 a night. The people who go  
 there range from 4 years to 80 years  
 of age. It is closed on Bank Holidays.
  To join the Community Association    
 costs Â£4 for a single person, Â£2 for a
 pensioner and Â£6 for a family.        
  In Autumn 1982, the sports hall was  
 built at a cost of Â£189,000. The      
 association runs many activities      
 ranging from ballet to badminton.
