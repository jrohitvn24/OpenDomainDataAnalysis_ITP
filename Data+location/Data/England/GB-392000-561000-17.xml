		<title>17A farm in Hexhamshire.</title>
		<content>{Oakerlands}(0.S.039405632)is a mixed  
 farm of 110 acres,and stands about    
 550ft.above sea level between the Tyne
 valley and Devils Water.Until last    
 year,Mr.Forster kept a dairy herd of  
 30 Friesian cows,but now he keeps     
 store cattle on 35 acres of pasture   
 land,rearing bullocks (Limousin,and   
 Friesian x Aberdeen Angus)and a herd  
 of  sucklers,which he sells at Hexham 
 mart,and 45 ewes and 80 lambs.He has  
 32 acres of arable land and grows     
 winter wheat and winter barley and 33 
 acres of hay.The farm house and       
 buildings were built about 100 years  
 ago from stone quarried at Fellside   
 near Hexham. Oakerlands probably got  
 its name from the ochre obtained      
 there,which was used in the tanning of
 leather to make the famous{Hexham     
{tans}_fine quality gloves made in     
 Hexham until the turn of the century. </content>
