		<title>13ELMINGTON, DESERTED VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   The name Elmington appears three    
 times on the local 1:25,000 O.S. map. 
 The name survives but the village does
 not. An estate or village existed in  
 1086. It belonged to Crowland Abbey   
 which gradually enclosed the arable   
 land for pasture from 1490. By 1720   
 all houses and buildings had gone.    
 Pasture required less labourers and   
 thus the village was depopulated. In  
 our area several such desertions      
 occured. The original names survive in
 houses, lodges or farms. These include
 Papley near Warmington, Hale near     
 Apethorpe and Perio near Southwick. In
 1985 the sites of such villages can be
 identified by crop-marks and strange  
 earth-works, but aerial photography is
 the most effective way of locating a  
 site. A more recent desertion just    
 outside this block is the former RAF  
 and USAF base at Polebrook.           </content>
