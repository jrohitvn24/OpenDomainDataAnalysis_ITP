 The Marlborough Head is part of an old
 clothier's house, built before 1500.  
 The  cellars which once held dyeing   
 vats now hold beer barrels. In 1702 it
 became an inn named after the Duke of 
 Marlborough. It is run by Jacky and   
 Brian Wills, who are praised in guide 
 books for their excellent meals and   
 sandwiches.                           
 The Anchor on Dedham Heath is run by  
 James Rouch who is also the author of 
 many novels of war and adventure.     
 Other inns are the Rose and Crown in  
 Crown Street, the Lamb at Lamb Corner,
 a very old inn, and the Black Horse by
 the river at Stratford St Mary with a 
 popular garden and a good darts team.
