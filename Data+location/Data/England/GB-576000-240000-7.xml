		<content>{KNOWLE GREEN}is a small hamlet a mile 
 south of the main part of Belchamp St.
 Paul. It got it's name because of Hole
 Farm which is in 'an hole', and the   
 meadow in the middle of the houses was
 once a 'green'. It was enclosed with a
 hawthorn hedge at the time of the     
{'Enclosures Act'.}There are 48 people 
 living in Knowle Green - of whom 13   
 are old age pensioners, 8 are of      
 school age, 1 is at college and 1 is  
 under school age. The population has  
 stayed constant even though there have
 been several houses built recently.   
 Whereas as many as 10 people lived in 
 a house, now there may be only 2.     
 Cappers farmhouse has gone.{Woodbarns 
{Farm}is a listed building - the oldest
 part is built on tree trunks for      
 foundations.{Hole Farm}is older than  
 it's Georgian facade. There are two   
 thatched cottages and a thatched inn. </content>
