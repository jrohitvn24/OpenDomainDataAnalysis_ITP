 These twin hamlets occupy a           
 particularly attractive site in the   
 valley of the River Mardle. Combe     
 stretches for about half a mile       
 between Cullaford Bridge and Combe    
 Bridge, and includes a group of       
 cottages which were formerly used by  
 woolcombers, and the parish hall,     
 which was the local school until 1934.
 Above Combe Bridge is Higher Combe,   
 which includes Mardle Wood House, once
 a woollen mill; The Old Chimney, which
 was the engine house of a copper mine 
 (part of the chimney stack can still  
 be seen); and The Bungalow, which     
 started life as an Exmouth beach      
 chalet, and was originally bought for 
 Â£45.
