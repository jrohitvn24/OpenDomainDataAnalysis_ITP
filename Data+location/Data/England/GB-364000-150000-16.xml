		<content> There are lots of different types of  
 housing in our area. Some cottages are
 very old but a lot of houses have been
 built since the 1930's.               
 There are some small  council housing 
 estates in both villages. Most of the 
 houses are semi-detached  with three  
 bedrooms but there are some detached  
 houses and one or two terraces.       
 The older houses are made of stone but
 the more modern houses are built with 
 red bricks or concrete blocks.        
 In both villages quite a few houses   
 have been bought by Downside Abbey and
 School. Staff who work there live in  
 the houses.
