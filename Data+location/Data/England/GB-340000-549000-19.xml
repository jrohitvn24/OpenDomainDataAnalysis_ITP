		<title>19THE LOSH FAMILY _ WREAY(II)</title>
		<content> John Losh had a weakling son and two  
 daughters.Sarah Losh is the daughter  
 who is best remembered as she left her
 mark in many ways in Wreay and its    
 surrounding area.She spoke several    
 languages and was widely recognised as
 a scholar able to converse with the   
 most learned of men.Her work on the   
 estate still survives in the trees and
 shrubs she planted to beautify it.In  
 1842 she designed,financed and super_ 
 vised the building of Wreay church.She
 was greatly concerned about the       
 crowded state of the church burial    
 grounds.Consequently,she made a gift  
 of an acre of land at Wreay which she 
 said must be open to all denominations
 and all classes.This cemetery is still
 there and is walled and planted with  
 ivy and flowering shrubs.She also had 
 built a chapel designed in the Italian
 style.                                </content>
