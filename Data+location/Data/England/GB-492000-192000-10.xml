 ensuring that we retain our health.A  
 typical daily diet consists of:       
  Breakfast:_ Various cereals which    
 are high in vitamins and iron.        
  Lunch:_ May just be a snack or a     
 a salad.All vegetables contain various
 vitamins which are good for the       
 teeth,bones and the blood.Salads are  
 also refreshing,especially in the     
 summer.                               
  Dinner:_ This is the main meal of the
 day for most people.It usually        
 consists of meat or fish,which        
 contain iron,green vegetables and     
 potatoes,which contain carbohydrates. 
  In this day and age we are becoming  
 more and more conscious of the        
 importance of a healthy diet and we   
 are seeing a great deal more activity 
 from food manufacturers and the media 
 to persuade us to get healthy and fit.</content>
