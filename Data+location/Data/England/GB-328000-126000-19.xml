		<title>19DOING THE DOMESDAY PROJECT</title>
		<content>  We began by thinking about the       
 original Domesday Book and why the    
 Domesday Project was being done in    
 1985.                                 
  We were given an area about four     
 miles away from our school to survey  
 for the Domesday Project.Although it  
 was close, none of us had even heard  
 of the villages there.It seemed very  
 different to where we lived.          
  First we went to have a general walk 
 around the place and immediately found
 the local people very helpful.Then we 
 made arrangements to visit particular 
 people.We saw farmers,the vicar and   
 ordinary residents.Everyone made us   
 very welcome.They were interested in  
 the project and wanted to know more.  
  Next we took photographs and did our 
 amenities count.Then we wrote about   
 what we had seen and heard and finally
 put it all into the computer.         </content>
