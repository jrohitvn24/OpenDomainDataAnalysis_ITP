		<title>05FACCOMBE WOOD</title>
		<content> Faccombe Wood is dominantly coniferous
 and covers an area of 375 acres,      
 surrounded by approximately 205 acres 
 of arable land. The wood has been     
 re-purchased recently from the        
 Forestry Commision by the new owners  
 of the estate; the previous owners    
 having had to sell the area to cover  
 death duties. A public footpath runs  
 through the wood from North to South, 
 this with other tracks has been       
 widened to provide fire breaks. There 
 is a profusion of wild flowers        
 including snowdrops and daffodils.    
 A footpath leading to derelict Curzon 
 Street Farm passes through            
 uncultivated  downland rich in wild   
 flowers including orchids; and        
 butterflies including Chalkhill Blue. 
 The policy of the estate is to not    
 spray within 6m of boundaries of      
 fields to protect wildlife.           </content>
