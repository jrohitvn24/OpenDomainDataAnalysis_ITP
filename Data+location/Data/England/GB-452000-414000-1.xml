		<content> GENERAL BACKGROUND.                   
  Our area is predominantly            
 agricultural.It is bordered by{LITTLE 
{SMEATON }in the north west,a quiet    
 village adjoining Kirk Smeaton,{WALDEN
{STUBBS}a farming hamlet in the        
 north east,a large council estate     
 forming part of {CAMPSALL}in the south
 with the village of {NORTON}in the    
 centre. {NORTON} is mostly owner      
 occupied but does have three small    
 blocks of council houses.  The area is
 transversed by the{R.WENT}which       
 separates the area into North         
 Yorkshire and the Metropolitan County 
 of South Yorkshire. Although mostly   
 agricultural very few people work on  
 the land. The chief influence on      
 labour is the{COALMINE}at Askern,with 
 its neighbouring Coalite plant and    
 the six nearby power stations fired by
 coal.                                 </content>
