		<title>03Lack of Jobs in S.Wakefield</title>
		<content>      From talking to older members of 
 the local community we found that at  
 one time the area had a good deal of  
 local industry. This meant that most  
 people who lived in our area could be 
 employed within it. Today the great   
 houses of Chevet Hall and Kettlethorpe
 Hall no longer have vast estates to   
 provide jobs; the sandstone quarry    
 at Newmillerdam has gone and only     
 recently the two small coal mines have
 been closed.                          
     Today the area houses people who  
 tend to work in not only the centre   
 of Wakefield but also Leeds,Dewsbury, 
 Barnsley, Sheffield and Doncaster. The
 increased use of the car and the      
 nearness to our area of the country's 
 main north-south link (Ml) and        
 trans-pennine route (M62) has made our
 area  residential zone bordered to the
 south by open country.                </content>
