		<content>  A  few  people  were  {interviewed}in
{South Ruislip.}These were  carried out
 on a Tuesday afternoon  in  July - the
 shoppers were  very helpful.

 Ruislip did so about once a week. They
 mainly go to the{bakers and grocers.} 
  Second,  a  man  behind  a  till at a
 train-station. He said  it  gets  busy
 between  7.30  and  9.30am  and 4.30 -
 6.30pm.                               
  Third, a  shop  keeper  over the road
 from the train station.  She said that
 she gets lots  of people  going there.
  Fourth,  another  lady said the shops
 she  went  to  were  not   very   good
 because they were very expensive.     
  Last  of  all  was  the{butchers.}The
 shop keeper said, all the  prices  are
 average.  The dearest product  was the
 fillet steak.
