       There are 1200 acres of land on 
 the heath.The NCC have a 21 year lease
 to the land previously owned by a     
 farmer who had tried to improve the   
 grazing by ploughing it up and        
 reseeding ,he adandoned this attempt. 
       The site contains some very     
 interesting plants and animals some of
 which are now becoming rare especially
 the wet heathland species,and although
 there are no plants protected by law  
 there are species of animals,including
 the Dorset Sand Lizard and the Dorset 
 Smooth Snake.                         
       Although there are deer grazing 
 on the site, it being bordered to the 
 S&amp;W by forest the wardens do not look 
 after the deer although there are many
 of them, they do however help run the 
 annual cull to ensure that the heath  
 is not overgrazed or a farming pest.  </content>
