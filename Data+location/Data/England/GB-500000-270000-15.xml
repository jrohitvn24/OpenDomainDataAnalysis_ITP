HARGRAVE HALL is where a company called
WARD WHITE (of Rushden) has its        
offices. Most of their interests are in
the shoe and leather trade. Several    
people from the village are employed to
work at the hall. HARGRAVE HALL was    
a restaurant before WARD WHITE bought  
it in the early 1980's. Before that it 
had always been used as a family home. 
It was built in the 19th Century by    
Lewis Baker. He sold it to a man       
called Lewis Holt, who later sold it   
to Sir Kenneth and Lady Murchison. In  
1949 it was sold to Mr &amp; Mrs Pedley    
who lived there until 1959. Since then 
it has been owned by a number of       
families - The Stobarts, Botterills,   
Johnsons and finally The Deranoys, who 
then sold it to WARD WHITE.
