		<title>03Tamsin's Saturday</title>
		<content> Hooray! It was Saturday again. I woke 
 up,cheerful after a good night's      
 sleep. I had slept with Katy the night
 before. We sat in our beds telling    
 jokes to each other .We went down     
 stairs and watched television.I had   
 some toast. We got dressed. I wore my 
 jogging suit and Katy wore hers.Katy  
 and I went round to my house to ask my
 mum if I could go down to the         
 Recreation Centre because I was going 
 to watch her at Karate and then go    
 swimming. Mum said yes but we had to  
 go and get a paper from the shop      
 first. At the  Centre I waited for    
 Katy to change, watched her do Karate 
 and then went swimming.After dressing,
 I went in the cafe and had a "Slush   
 Puppy".On the way home we had some    
 food. After a play in the field, we   
 went to my nan's, in Southampton for  
 tea and later, straight home to bed.  </content>
