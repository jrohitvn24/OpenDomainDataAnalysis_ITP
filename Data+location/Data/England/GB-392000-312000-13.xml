		<title>134C's and Monkton</title>
		<content> The 4C's and Monkton are buildings    
having facilities for the clubs that   
younger and older people like.  The    
4C's has a few activities such as      
badminton, tennis, swimming and squash.
It is also a nightclub, one night for  
teenagers and all the rest of the      
nights are for over eighteens.         
 The Monkton is similar but has a lot  
more clubs there. Here are some of     
them: tennis, badminton, table tennis, 
squash, football, darts and golf. Some 
of the clubs were set up for younger   
children to help stop them getting     
bored in the holidays and at weekends. 
A lot of children attend these clubs   
and enjoy the indoor and outdoor       
facilities.
