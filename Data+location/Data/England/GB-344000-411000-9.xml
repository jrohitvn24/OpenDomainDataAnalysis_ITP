		<title>09HISTORY OF BURSCOUGH 3</title>
		<content>  The newest school in Burscough is    
County Primary built in the 1970's.    
Lordsgate Township was rebuilt after   
the 2nd World War when the land it was 
originally built on was needed for an  
air field.                             
  Burscough was quite an important     
thoroughfare during the War,with the   
Leeds to Liverpool Canal, the rail-    
way running from west to east and north
to south and the A59 from Liverpool to 
Preston.                               
  The village was thought to be        
relatively safe,the Germans trying but 
failing to bomb it only once.So        
evacuees came to stay with families    
from the towns, especially Liverpool,  
and several people slept in the        
schools.   A Memorial was erected on   
the A59 to commemorate the dead of     
both World Wars.
