		<title>02Kington :Major employment</title>
		<content>  In Kington and it's surroundings the 
 employment is quite good. A lot of    
 school children of 14 and upwards have
 Saturday jobs. Quite a lot of the     
 young do paper rounds. Older people   
 work in eg Walters Trouser, Hegotron  
 Printed Circuits Ltd and the laundry. 
 A lot of people get jobs to look after
 children while the childrens' parents 
 go out to work. The most difficult    
 work to obtain is in agriculture and  
 construction and there are few jobs   
 for professional people. There is     
 plenty of seasonal work eg fruit      
 picking, shearing, potato picking,    
 apple picking. Unemployment is quite  
 low. If you are unemployed you have to
 go and sign on in Leominster, so      
 people have to travel by bus to sign  
 on. Payment for the jobs is below the 
 national average but is going up all  
 the time.                             </content>
