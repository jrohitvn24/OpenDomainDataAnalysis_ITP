   Facilities in the village for       
 recreational purposes includethe      
 Pub,the Youth club,Darby and Joan     
 club, the Womens Institute,and events 
 organised by the churches and Sunday  
 school.                               
   It is hoped that a playing field    
 will soon be ready for the young      
 people of the village. At the present 
 there is a small play area by the side
 of the W.I. Hall.                     
   In the evenings and at weekends the 
 children of Withernwick take part in a
 number of activities e.g. swimming,   
 and horse riding being very popular.  
 Karate and Judo, Brownies,Guides,Cubs 
 are some of the clubs the children    
 attend.Some other children like to go 
 to Piano or Ballet lessons.
