   My children's other hobbies are     
 dancing-they go to ballet and tap     
 dancing lessons in Hamstreet Victory  
 Hall one evening per week after       
 school-Brownies- my eldest daughter   
 attends this once a week in Ruckinge. 
 My youngest daughter is also looking  
 forward to going but there is an age  
 limit and she cannot start until she  
 is 7 years old. Playing the piano(they
 are both having lessons),the flute(my 
 eldest daughter is having lessons at  
 school) and horse riding(again they   
 are both having lessons). Our eldest  
 daughter is also learning to play     
 Netball at school which she enjoys    
 very much.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
