		<title>16BECKFIELD HOUSE HEIGHINGTON.</title>
		<content>      Beckfield House is situated on   
 Station Road surrounded by tall, shady
 trees.It was eight years ago since Mrs
 Birch and her husband  started        
 Beckfield House as an old peoples     
 home.                                 
       As there is no special day for  
 visitors people are coming and going  
 all the time.                         
        There are twenty six people    
 living there at the moment. As there  
 has now been a new wing built  they   
 can take  in even more people in,     
 before it was built there was only    
 fifteen people living there.          
        Twenty two people work         
 there,that inculdes the two cooks.    
      There is no waiting list as by   
 the time they have room for someone   
 else  they will either have died or   
 moved away.Mrs Birch is not strict as 
 she wants the people to feel at home. </content>
