		<content>   The danger with our village is that 
 it is fast becoming a middle class    
 commuter estate. Most of the community
 work outside of this area and use the 
 village as a peaceful retreat.This has
 resulted in a change in the group     
 identity or composition of the        
 population.                           
   The unity of the village has broken 
 up into splinter groups;no longer does
 everyone know each other.             
   Responsibility for social behaviour 
 is weakened so that problems with     
 youth or the elderly get harder to    
 isolate and therefore remedy.         
   There are events such as the        
 carnival and annual show at the       
 village hall which brings many people 
 together, but beyond that, nobody     
 wants to know.It is up to schools to  
 try and forge the new community into a
 caring and once again whole society.  </content>
