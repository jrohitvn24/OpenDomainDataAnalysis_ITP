		<content>     The Leisure Centre is built on    
the banks of the River Trent.   It     
contains a large swimming pool and a   
smaller teaching pool.   There are     
other activities that you can take part
in such as squash and badminton.       
There are also some sun-beds and a     
sauna.   When you have finished        
swimming you can go to the cafe if you 
want anything to eat.   They also have 
a bar for the grown-ups and they       
sometimes have discos.   If you go in  
the car to the leisure centre there are
two car parks.   The leisure centre is 
a good place to go to.
