 Nicola is a pupil at Robinsons End    
 Middle School.                        
 "My favourite hobbies are dancing and 
 cooking.Every Saturday I go dancing at
 the Ace Dance Centre.I go with Heidi  
 and Claire.You have to have a leotard 
 and skirt.I also practise a lot at    
 home when I have time.I'm very keen on
 dancing,and my teacher is nice too.   
  Every Sunday,when my mum makes the   
 dinner,she lets me make some cakes or 
 a pie for pudding.When I was little my
 mum let me play with the leftover     
 pastry,and I used to throw it against 
 the wall,and I used to get told       
 off.When it's near Christmas I make a 
 load of mince pies,and I also help my 
 mum make the Christmas cake."         </content>
