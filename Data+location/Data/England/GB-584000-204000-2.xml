		<title>02BIRDS EYE VIEW OF MALDON</title>
		<content>   On a clear day in July standing     
 60 feet up on the roof of Moot Hall we
 were suprised by the fantastic view.We
 could clearly see 15 miles of country-
 side and the Blackwater Estuary.      
   The first thing you see is the High 
 Street and the roofs of houses and    
 shops.The colours of the roof tiles   
 make a mosaic skyline-red tiles mainly
 showing old buildings and grey slates 
 the newer buildings.One feature notic-
 ed was the bend in the High Street not
 really seen when travelling by car or 
 on foot.The street was noisy and busy.
   The tide was out and we could see a 
 large expanse of mud flats,Northey and
 Osea Islands.Bradwell Power station   
 was visible on the horizon and many   
 village steeples and water towers.    
   How we wish we could be birds every 
 day admiring the spectacular view!
