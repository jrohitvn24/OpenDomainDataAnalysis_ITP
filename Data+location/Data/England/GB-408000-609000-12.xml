		<title>12Industry -  Brickworks</title>
		<content> In 1937 Commander Viner, who lived at 
 Fountains Abbey set up businesses in  
 Northumberland for the Jarrow         
 unemployed and built the village of   
 Swarland, also a Tweed mill and a Saw 
 mill at Amble. He also built a Brick  
 works on the site of an old Tilery at 
 Thrunton. There were 35 employees and 
 operations were labour intensive. When
 the 1939-45 war broke out, workers    
 from Jarrow returned to the shipyards.
 Early in the war, bricks were made for
 military projects, but the works had  
 to close down and became a Ministry of
 Food Depot. The Blythes bought the    
 brickworks in 1942. The works reopened
 after the war and nowadays are well   
 mechanised, employ 28 men and produce 
 common bricks and 9 varieties of      
 facing bricks.
