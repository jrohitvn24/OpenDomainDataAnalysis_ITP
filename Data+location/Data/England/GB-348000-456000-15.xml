		<title>15Family life: dawn to dusk</title>
		<content> In the village of Ellel life goes on  
 as usual.  In a country house used    
 many years ago as a coach house, not  
 far from the university lives a family
 of four.  The day starts with         
 breakfast then it's off to work.  Both
 of the children go to different       
 schools but travel by car, while the  
 husband walks as he works at the      
 university and the wife cycles.  The  
 husband gets home on an average day at
 6 pm while the wife arrives home at   
 4 pm ready for the children to arrive 
 home from school.  To relax after work
 the wife can go to the university to  
 swim, while the daughter goes to      
 Forton for piano or riding lessons and
 the son to Lancaster for guitar       
 lessons.  They like living there as it
 is in the country and convenient for  
 the university.
