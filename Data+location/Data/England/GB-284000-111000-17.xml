		<content> The arts are kept alive by experts in 
 painting, drawing, pressed-flower     
 pictures and decorated egg-shells.    
 Flower arranging is a popular art     
 form. Crafts such as spinning from    
 Devon Closewool fleeces are practised,
 natural materials such as leaves,     
 beetroot and lichens are used to dye  
 the wool. One man has a kiln in his   
 garden and produces pottery there.    
 Another makes beautiful articles in   
 wood including cases for grandfather  
 clocks.                               
 Wine is made from wild and garden     
 produce. Bee-keeping is absorbing and 
 rewarding. Our blacksmith combines his
 talent for free-hand design with      
 mastery in wrought-iron work to create
 a range of objects from candlesticks  
 to gates. Cookery and cake-icing with 
 knitting, sewing, canvas-work and     
 patchwork are skilled crafts here.    </content>
