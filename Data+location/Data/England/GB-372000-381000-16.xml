 CHESHIRE WAS ONCE DESCRIBED AS 'THE   
 SEED PLOT OF GENTILITY' BECAUSE OF ITS
 MANY LANDED GENTRY OF ANCIENT         
 DESCENT. OF 17 SUCH ESTATES ONLY MERE 
 IS LEFT STILL RUNNING ON TRADITIONAL  
 LINES.                                
  THE {BROOKE}FAMILY BOUGHT THE        
 ESTATE FROM THE MERES AS FORTUNES     
 CHANGED FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR. SIR  
 PETER BROOKE WAS KNIGHTED AND BUILT   
 THE JACOBEAN HALL. THEIR FORTUNES     
 INCREASED AFTER MARRIAGE TO A LANGFORD
 HEIRESS; FIRES AND EARLY DEATHS DOGGED
 THE LANGFORD-BROOKE FAMILY.

 CONSISTING OF{5 FARMS,21 COTTAGES AND 
{210 ACRES OF MIXED WOODLAND,}USED AS A
