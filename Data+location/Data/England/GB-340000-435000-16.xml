		<content> Leisure activities of a family of     
 four, consisting of father, mother and
 two boys, aged 9 and 11. Father plays 
 squash twice a week at a club outside 
 the area. His main hobby is computer  
 activities, for example programming,  
 household accounts and some games. He 
 also carries out most household and   
 car maintenance. Both parents enjoy   
 gardening. Mother enjoys sewing,      
 making her own and boys' clothes. She 
 is an active member of local WI and   
 goes to Scottish Dancing outside the  
 area. The boys belong to scouts and   
 cubs which are outside the area. They 
 also leave the area for football,     
 cricket and swimming. Family outings  
 are usually to fell country eg,       
 pennines or Lake District, for        
 walking, or cycling in the local area 
 which is very flat.
