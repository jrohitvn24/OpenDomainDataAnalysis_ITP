		<title>13PROBLEMS OF RECREATION</title>
		<content> Despite the various recreational      
 activities on offer and others like   
 walking,fishing in the Lune and golf  
 on the small golf course,local        
 residents feel that the leisure       
 facilities are inadequate.With a large
 percentage of older people,demand for 
 energetic pursuits is not great,and it
 is often difficult to persuade        
 sufficient people to arrange them.Many
 young people feel that there is very  
 little for them to do in the evening, 
 except occasionally visit the{Youth   
{Club}at{Centre Five}in Horsemarket.   
 Fortunately,unemployment is not high  
 and so there are few with little to do
 during the day.Some residents believe 
 that more{leisure facilities}should be
 created,such as a swimming pool or    
 leisure complex,but the cost would be 
 high.Others think that school         
 facilities should be used more.       </content>
