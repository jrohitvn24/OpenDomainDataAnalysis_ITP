		<content>  Fish processing is carried out in    
 Seahouses at the firm of J.W.Thorburn 
 &amp; Sons established in 1945. The firm, 
 which employs 10, mainly supplies     
 small local shops , but, does have its
 own retail van.                       
  The white fish used come from fishing
 ports up as far as Fraserburgh on the 
 East Coast. The Herring used to make  
 their kippers come from the West Coast
 of Scotland, mainly the Loch Fyne     
 area.                                 
  Kippering is carried out in the      
 traditional way, smoking with hard    
 wood shavings for about 6 hours, and  
 no articial colouring or preservative 
 is used.                              
  All transport is by road and the firm
 uses a refrigerated container when    
 collecting and delivering fish and    
 fish products.
