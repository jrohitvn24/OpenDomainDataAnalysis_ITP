		<title>11WORK OUTSIDE THE VILLAGES</title>
		<content>   Farming,gravel extraction,concrete  
 manufacture and the research station  
 don't employ many people,and some of  
 those travel from outside.            
   Inevitably,these days,there is some 
 local unemployment but it is probably 
 lower than the area's average.        
   It can be seen,therefore,that the   
 bulk of the{workers}must work{outside}
 the{villages.}They travel to{Newark,  
{Southwell,}and,especially,{Nottingham}
 and all over the area.They span all   
 the socio-economic classes and do{all 
{kinds of work.}They travel by rail and
 especially by car.There is a steady   
 stream of road traffic out each morn- 
 ing which,converging with other       
 traffic,helps to create the morning   
 rush hour,especially towards Nottm.   
   The roads may be slow but they are  
 there and not unpleasant.And what luck
 to have a decent rail service!        </content>
