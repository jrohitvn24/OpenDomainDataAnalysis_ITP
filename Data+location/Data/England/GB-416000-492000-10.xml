		<title>10Farming:Hunton &amp; Hauxwell</title>
		<content>   The  farmland  which  covers most of
 this block supports 18 local families,
 but,because of modern farming methods,
 it gives  full-time employment to only
 28 men.  Wives and children have their
 tasks, such as feeding calves, leading
 cows  or helping  at lambing, hay  and
 harvest time.                         
  12 farms keep{Friesian dairy cows,}on
 average 51 per herd.  One Hauxwell man
 is proud of his Shorthorns.The milking
 parlours are normally operated  by one
 labourer.Tankers collect the milk each
 day and take it to Northallerton. Cows
 are kept indoors in winter. They  help
 themselves  to silage from clamps with
 a self_feed face.  Big{round bales}are
 the 'in-thing' this year. Bull calves,
 often bought  as  stores, are fattened
 indoors  on barley by half the farmers
 and go for meat.  Blewery Grange hires
 out three Hereford bulls to the Dales.</content>
