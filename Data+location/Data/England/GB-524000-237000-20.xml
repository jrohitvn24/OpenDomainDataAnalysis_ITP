		<title>20SURVEY NOTES</title>
		<content> The survey on this block was carried  
 by pupils from Norton School          
 Letchworth,some 6 Km. away from       
 Ashwell.Our views were thus rather    
{impressionistic}and because we carried
 out the survey in school time we did  
 not speak to many of the commuters who
 live in the area.                     
 Perhaps we were able to find out      
 things as outsiders that people living
 in the area would pass over however.  
 The survey work was carried out by    
 First Year pupils (11 year olds) with 
 the help of staff and Sixth Form      
 Pupils(17 year olds).
