		<title>02**   MAYPOLE PROCESSION   **</title>
		<content> The procession starts at school. Weeks
 beforehand people have been hard at   
 work making floats and decorations.   
 They borrow tractors and lorries from 
 nearby farmers. All the local         
 schoolchildren and their parents take 
 part. Each organisation has its own   
 float. The procession follows the main
 streets of the village before it      
 arrives at Hall Tower field for the   
 afternoon's entertainment.

 On the afternoon of Spring Bank       
 Holliday, two maypoles with ribbons   
 stand at the bottom of the hill.      
 Children from each school dance round 
 them. On a raised stand the queen and 
 her attendants sit. Flowers are given 
 to people who have been invited to do 
 the crowning and speeches are made.
