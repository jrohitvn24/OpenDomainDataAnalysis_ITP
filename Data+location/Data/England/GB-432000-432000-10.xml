		<title>10Work in the Area</title>
		<content>    There is little work in the area.  
  On osmondthorpe lane there is the    
 Nevillle Hill Depot of British Rail.  
   This is an engineering repair works 
 and cleansing unit.   There is also   
 Festival Foods plant at the top of    
 Osmondthorpe Lane.   These are the    
 only two industrial employers         
    People have to travel outside the  
 area to Harehills for tailoring or    
 Hunslet for engineering.   Closures in
 the tailoring trade affected the area 
 and many people were made redundant.  
    The Cross Green Industrial Estate  
 to the south west does provide a new  
 source of employment for the area.    
 It is close enough to walk to and from
 the area to the estate.
