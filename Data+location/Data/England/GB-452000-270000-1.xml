		<content> We have planned a walk around our     
 Domesday area.                        
 The walk uses public footpaths,bridal 
 ways,tow-paths and a minor road.  The 
 walk is being published by the        
 Northamptonshire library service and  
 is obtainable from them or Kilsby     
 school.                               
 Our area has two main centres of      
 civilasation although one, Kilsby, is 
 only partly in our block.             
 The area is mainly agricultural.  The 
 southern four squares feature a ridge.
 Local tradition has it that you have  
 to travel to Moscow to reach a similar
 elevation when you are travelling     
 east.                                 
 The eight northerly squares feature   
 afertile valley crossed by main road, 
 rail and canal routes.
