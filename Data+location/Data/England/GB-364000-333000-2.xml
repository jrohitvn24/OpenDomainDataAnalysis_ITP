		<content> A modern two bay fire station on      
 Maer Lane serves the area and gives   
 assistance to neighbouring counties as
 well.The two appliances are manned by 
 twenty part time crew controlled by a 
 full time station officer who is      
 responsible for three other stations. 
 The men are called out in cases of    
 emergency by means of a radio alerter 
 system,each  man carrying a pocket    
 receiver.The fire station has manually
 operated up and over doors leading to 
 the two bays.A range of heated lockers
 are provided and a drying room is also
 available.The adjacent drill yard has 
 a tank for testing pumps and training 
 operators.There is a 50 foot drill    
 tower.
