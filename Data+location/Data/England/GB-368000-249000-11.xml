		<content> People living within this block must  
 travel to find entertainment outside  
 their homes and away from television, 
 since there is not even one pub in the
 area. However there is an amateur     
 theatre in Bromyard (and many pubs)   
 three miles away and permanent        
 theatres in Hereford and Worcester    
 each fifteen miles away, and also home
 in their respective year to the       
 peripatetic Three Choirs Festival. In 
 an area of festivals, residents can be
 intellectually entertained at Malvern 
 or Ludlow, while Bromyard hosts an    
 increasingly successful folk festival 
 each autumn and also has its annual   
 five day Gala. Nearer to home,        
 Stanford Bishop has a flourishing     
 annual harvest supper, well attended  
 by everyone living locally. Largest   
 social gatherings tend to be at       
 farm sales and funerals.              </content>
