		<content>  Preparations begin months before the 
races.Three weeks before a race,entry  
forms are sent out.Entries are         
confirmed four days before the race,   
and trainers must make the final       
declaration of their horses which are  
running 24 hours before the start.     
 Before a jockey races he has to be    
weighed.All the jockeys get changed    
in one room where there is a weighing  
machine.The jockeys weigh themselves   
and if they are too light they put on  
heavier boots or lead weights in the   
saddles. Then they all go out to be    
weighed separately.After a race is over
the jockeys are weighed again. If they 
are found to be over weight they could 
be fined up to 500 pounds.             
 Spectators can watch the races from   
3 areas, the Silver Ring, Tattersalls  
and the Club area.On 12 days of the    
year,the racing is televised nationwide</content>
