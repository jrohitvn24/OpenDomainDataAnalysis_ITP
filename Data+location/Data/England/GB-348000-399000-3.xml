		<title>03 PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>  Brook Lodge is a primary school of 96
infants and 166 juniors.It is a modern 
building with excellent amenities e.g. 
good gym and sports equipment.There is 
no set timetable,but maths,science,    
humanities and scripture are covered.  
Many after-school societies exist.Also 
the school produces a play annually.   
The pupils go on an adventure holiday  
in the fourth year.                    
  The village school at Crank is 126   
years old.It has 41 pupils,but 10 years
ago it had 120.Most of the people in   
the village do not wish to see the     
school close.The opening of a new      
school in Rainford contributed to this 
decline.Although some Rainford children
come to Crank,some Crank children go   
to Rainford.The school is the focus of 
life in Crank,providing an individual  
education,but needs a staff of eleven  
to keep it running.                    </content>
