		<title>07Passenger Rail Link to Corby</title>
		<content>Corby councillors have been pushing    
hard to get the passenger railway link 
between Kettering and Corby re-opened. 
The passenger service was closed in    
1966 when Corby station was also shut  
down.Malcolm Southgate,general manager 
of B.R. in the Midlands,and Ray Cross, 
chairman of Northamptonshire Council's 
public transport study group,were among
officials who attended a meeting to    
discuss the possible re-opening.Corby  
councillors would like a new station   
built on the former steelworks site.   
Surveys show that Corby would provide  
at least 150 000 passengers a year and 
if the new Wonderworld leisure complex 
is built,passengers into Corby are ex- 
pected to top the million mark each    
year. Support for Corby's campaign was 
unanimously pledged by representatives 
from other local councils at a special 
meeting.                               </content>
