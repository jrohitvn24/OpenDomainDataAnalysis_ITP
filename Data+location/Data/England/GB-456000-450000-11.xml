		<content>{ Clifton and Leeman Rd area.}We went  
 to Clifton and saw very big terraced  
 house streets.They are Victorian and  
 Edwardian:Bootham Terr.,Lincoln St.,  
 Forth St., Jubilee Terr.and Water     
 End.We found semi-detached            
 houses which are two houses joined    
 together. Longfield Terrace and       
 Chudleigh Road are a mixture of       
 terraced and semis. Detached          
 houses are not very common in Leeman  
 Rd.The Leeman Rd area is like a       
 village  within the city of York      
 bounded by the river and the          
 railway.                              
{ Acomb}is a large residential suburb  
 of the city and is about two miles    
 west of the City Centre.As well as a  
 large private housing estate there are
 three large council estates. On one   
 of these are many prefabs built soon  
 after the Second World War in 1946-47.</content>
