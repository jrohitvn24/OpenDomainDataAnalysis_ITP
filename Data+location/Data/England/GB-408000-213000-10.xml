		<title>10EDUCATION_WESTWOOD'S GRAMMAR</title>
		<content>   Westwood's Grammar School has been  
 in existence for 400 years. There are 
 313 pupils including a lower and upper
 sixth. The small size ofthe school is 
 considered special and successful, as 
 the 'O' level pass rate is 20% over   
 the national average. 17 subjects are 
 taught at 'O' level and 12 at 'A'     
 level. There are 20 full_time teachers
 and 2 part_time _17 people keep the   
 school going, groundsmen etc. 13 rooms
 are used at the school.               
 At Westwoods there are 3 houses,      
 Westwoods, Bradley and Rixon. These   
 houses compete in sports day, a drama 
 competition, pop quiz and a technology
 competition. Recently,"Smike" was     
 performed which was very successful.  
 Proposals have been put forward to    
 amalgamate Westwoods with Bourton     
 secondary school, though nothing will 
 be decided until November.            </content>
