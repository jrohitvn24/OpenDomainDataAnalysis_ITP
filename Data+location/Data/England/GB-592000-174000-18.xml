		<title>18Floods in Sheerness</title>
		<content>      Sheerness has suffered from      
 several{floods}the worst being in     
 1953. A local resident told us of her 
 childhood{memories.                   
      Seeing the{sea}on her doorstep   
 the initial reaction was one of       
 excitement but she soon realised she  
 would have to stay in all day.        
      An amusing memory was of the     
 police inspector across the road      
 climbing into a boat which had come to
 collect him. On stepping aboard it    
 capsized tipping him into the flood   
 water.                                
      The flood caused much damage to  
 the{housing.}The RAF were called in to
 dry them out using hot air pumps.     
 Plaster was knocked down and replaced.
      Today problems still arise with  
 salt in the bricks causing dampness.  
 Only last year her house had to be    
 damp proofed once again.              </content>
