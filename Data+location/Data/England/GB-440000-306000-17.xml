		<title>17STORIES FROM NAILSTONE</title>
		<content>    There is a saying about the{old elm
{tree}that used to stand by the side of
 the A447 on the edge of the village.  
 It was said that should this tree     
 perish there would be no more babies  
 born in Nailstone. The story goes     
 that one night Lord Hastings sent some
 of his workmen to cut the tree down as
 it had been made unsafe by a storm.   
 The villagers came out to protect the 
 tree fearing the worst. The tree      
 survived and many villagers can       
 remember it as a well known landmark. 
                                       
    A clock maker called{Samuel'Clocky'
{Deacon}used to preach to the villagers
 about the evils of drink. Clocky was  
 locked up in the blacksmith's yard at 
 Smithy Farm for three days and three  
 nights, because of a policeman who had
 taken some ale whilst he was on duty. 
 This was thought to be Clocky's fault.</content>
