		<title>10Surnames in Kingsley</title>
		<content>                                       
  A few surnames are very common in    
our part of Staffordshire and they     
have been found in the village for     
many years. We looked  on the          
tombstones in the churchyard and found 
these names from more than a hundred   
years ago:  Keeling, Clowes,           
Goldstraw, Prince, Malkin, Stoddard,   
Wheawall and Bradshaw.                 
  These names are still found in our   
village today. There are children in   
the village school called Keeling,     
Clowes, Stoddard and Bradshaw. The     
school caretaker is Mr Goldstraw. One  
of the govenors is Mr Joe Malkin, who  
has lived in the village for 70 years. 
  Many new families have moved into the
new houses in Kingsley in the last two 
decades. The old names are found on the
farms and in the old part of the       
village.                               </content>
