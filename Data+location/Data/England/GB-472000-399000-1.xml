		<content>    Westwoodside is an amalgamation of 
 five previous hamlets and stands in   
 the centre of the triangle of         
 Doncaster, Scunthorpe and Gainsborough
    The main observation is the        
 continuing change from a purely       
 agricultural community to a mixture of
 growing suburbia, surrounded by large 
 open tracts of land. The fertile sandy
 and warp soil produce good crops for  
 farmers and gardeners alike.          
    25% of the adult population is of  
 retired people and 60% a commuting    
 work force. Agriculture, market       
 gardening and small businesses account
 for the remaining 15%.                
    For many people, living in the     
 village forms an interim period. The  
 indigenous farming community provides 
 stability in this changeable setting.
