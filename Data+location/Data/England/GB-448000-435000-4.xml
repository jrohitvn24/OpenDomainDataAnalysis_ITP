		<content> We interviewed several old people in  
 Church Fenton to find out what they   
 felt about village life for the over  
 60's in 1985.                         
 1.All were born here or moved here to 
 get married or work on the            
 railway,Firth Blakleys engineering or 
 R.A.F.base.                           
 2.They have help from home helps and  
 go regularly to the over 60's club.   
 3.Their days are spent meeting friends
 for a chat on the bench next to the   
 school,walking the many paths or      
 watching T.V.                         
 4.They purchase their groceries from  
 the village shop and occasionally go  
 by bus to Sherburn or York for special
 things.                               
 5.They say the village is a friendly  
 place apart from the noise of the     
 R.A.F. planes which living there they 
 get used to but still dislike.        </content>
