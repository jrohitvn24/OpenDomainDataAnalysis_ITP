 It was headlines like this that       
 accompanied the beginning of the      
 campaign to fight the proposal that   
 low level and intermediate radioactive
 waste should be stored at the Elstow  
 storage depot. This waste would remain
 dangerously radioactive for at least  
 300 years. There is great concern in  
 the area that :                       
 1.  Employers would avoid the area,   
 seriously affecting local employment. 
 2.  House prices would fall.          
 3.  Radioactive leaks might           
 occur,threatening the health of the   
 local population and particularly     
 could lead to an increase in cancer in
 children.
