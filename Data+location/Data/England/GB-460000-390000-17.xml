		<title>17PEOPLE WHO HELP US AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school caretaker is  Mr. Parish.  
 He looks after our school and helps   
 to make it clean and tidy.He gets up  
 early in the morning,and finishes just
 before we start school.After we go    
 home he comes back to tidy our        
 classrooms.It takes him about three   
 hours with the help of the            
 cleaners.The cleaners are very helpful
 because our school is quite large and 
 Mr. Parish would be unable to clean it
 himself.The cleaners polish the floor 
 with a kind of hoover to make it      
 shiney.They do all the jobs in school 
 like cleaning the toilets,hoovering   
 the carpets and emptying the bins.We  
 also get painters in our school,we    
 have just had the hall painted.
