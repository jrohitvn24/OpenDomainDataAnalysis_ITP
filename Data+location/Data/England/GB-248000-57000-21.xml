<content>Crownhill Fort was built in 1870.It was used during the Second World War.We found gun emplacements and an old dry ski-slope there. Now a premier tourist attraction run by the Landmark Trust.     &lt;br />&lt;br />Seaton Barracks closed in 1995 when 59 Commando moved to RMB Chivenor. Purchased in 1999 by the Regional Development Agency it is now occupied by the partly developed Plymouth International Business Park. &lt;br />&lt;br />RNEC (Royal Naval Engineering College) sadly closed in 1995 too and is now occupied by the Manadon Park housing estate. The Royal Navy ceased to train graduate-level engineers in-house and training transferred to civilian universities and RN specialist "schools".&lt;br />
