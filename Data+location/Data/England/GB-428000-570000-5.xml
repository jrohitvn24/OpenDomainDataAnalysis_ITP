		<title>05 VIETNAM TO BACKWORTH--BINH.</title>
		<content> I was born in Vietnam.When the war    
was nearly over I was one and a        
half.My  brother was born in a cave    
 uring the war in Vietnam.The cave     
where my family hid was wet.They had   
to climb steps to a well to get water. 
The steps were slippy like marble and  
dangerous.        When we left we were 
lucky we got onto a ferry which did    
not sink. We landed in Hong Kong.We    
lived in a village of tents.It was not 
very nice.We were not  allowed to stay 
in Hong Kong and were   flown to       
Newcastle.I lived in a Y.M.C.A in      
Stockton until we were given a house   
in Backworth. My parents have been to  
college to learn English but only know 
a little. They do not have jobs.My     
father was a blacksmith in Vietnam.We  
left everthing in Vietnam except our   
valuables and some clothes.
