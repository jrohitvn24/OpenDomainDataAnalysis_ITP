		<content>{Social Concerns}  The editor of a     
newspaper has the difficult task of    
putting a weeks news into one issue.   
At the moment the one complaint that   
keeps arrising is Terminal 5 at        
Heathrow.Some people do not want the   
new terminal as its flight path is     
right over their houses.{Reactions}    
Families who have had great losses     
find it easy to talk to journalists.   
Working  for a newspaper can be a      
depressing job.The families like more  
people to hear about their tragic      
stories. {Attitudes} The newspaper we  
interviewed writes mainly for adults   
though it used to have a children's    
page. The readers have many different  
views on different subjects and there  
is a page for their letters.           
The newspaper has to suffer with a lot 
of {complaints} about the M25 motorway 
being too noisy.                       </content>
