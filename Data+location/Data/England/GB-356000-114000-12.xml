		<title>12Leather Industry In Yeovil.</title>
		<content>{Yeovil is famous for leather,         
 especially{gloves.}It was mentioned in
 1327 when John Glover and John Scynner
 were said to make the best gloves in  
 the west of England. In 1724 Daniel   
 Defoe wrote about Yeovil:{"A market   
{town of good resort:it's main         
{manufacture is the making of gloves." 
 In the 18th century there was a       
 thriving cottage indusry around Yeovil
 for the cutting and sewing of gloves. 
 In 1834 300,000 dozen (the traditional
 unit of measure) gloves were made by  
 an estimated 20,000 men,women and     
 chidren. In 1927 an apprentice glover 
 started work for 50p for a 46 h. week.
 He had no holiday apart from Bank     
 Holiday. Today only 2 small firms make
 gloves by hand where before 1939 there
 were over 40.{Yeovil's tradition of   
{leather is carried on by Pittards,    
{leather specialists since 1826.       </content>
