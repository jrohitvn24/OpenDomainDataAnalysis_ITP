		<title>12CHANGES IN MISSON</title>
		<content> I interviewed an old lady in Misson to
 find out what had changed.Her father  
 used to to be a Miller.Transport was  
 much the same but "old fashioned".A   
 few buildings  have gone and a lot    
 have been built.The landscape has     
 changed.In 1942 the  mill was pulled  
 down.In 1962 the old school was left  
 for the new one.She thought that      
 the quarrying had spoilt the land     
 too.a                                 
 paddle steamer used to go up and down 
 the river.The ferry would take you up 
 to Everton for tuppence.The floods    
 were bad and at one time you could    
 skate over the fields.The winters     
 were very severe but the summers were 
 good.The roads were much better than  
 they are now without the lanes to     
 spoil them.
