		<content> This is a{rural}agricultural region   
 with a{hamlet}and a{village.}There are
 no railways or major roads only the   
 B1114 Norwich to Bury St. Edmunds road
 which passes through the village of   
 Kenninghall.                          
 There is no heavy{industry}much of the
 employment except for agriculture is  
 out of the village.                   
 It is a{sleepy backwater}of rural     
 Eastern England,which has never the   
 less seen great changes during the    
 last thirty years in housing, changing
 employment and population.            
 Although there have been many new     
 faces in the villages it still remains
 a{friendly community.
