		<title>11Events In Hannington</title>
		<content> The main event which unites the vil-  
 lage &amp; attracts people from all around
 is the country Fayre &amp; Barbeque which 
 raises money to finance the fabric of 
 the church, village clubs &amp; activities
 &amp; maintenance of the village hall.    
 The event takes place every two out of
 three years, and traditionally a local
 farm provides a carcass of lamb/pork, 
 for open spit-roasting. The venue is  
 the Village Green: Sideshows, arena   
 attractions, pony rides, &amp; entertain- 
 ments. Hot snacks, drinks &amp; ices are  
 sold. Various crafts are exhibited in 
 the village hall, by skilled crafts-  
 men &amp; women. There is no entrance fee 
 although Â£1.00 per car is charged for 
 parking in fields close by.           
 This Fayre always takes place in June.
