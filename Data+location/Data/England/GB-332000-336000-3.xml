		<title>03NEWSAGENTS IN ST.MARTINS</title>
		<content>{Woodcocks}is quite a small corner     
 shop.It sells newspapers,food,toys and
 fancy goods.It is the{only newsagents 
 in the village of St.Martins.It opens 
 at 7.00.a.m.every day and closes at   
 5.30.p.m.except on Sunday, when it    
 closes at 12.30.p.m. When people go to
 work they can buy a newspaper to read 
 at lunchtime.                         
 Usually there are one or two          
 part-time people working in the shop. 
 Mrs.Mc.Loughlin,one of the assistants,
 said she liked her job because she    
 lives locally and it is handy.She only
 works sixteen hours a week.Before and 
 after school a lot of children buy    
 sweets at{Woodcocks}because it is so  
 near to school.Many elderly people use
 the shop mainly to have a chat to the 
 assistants because they don't get     
 personal service at the local         
 supermarkets.                         </content>
