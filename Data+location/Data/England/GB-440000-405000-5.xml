		<content>{Great Houghton Pigeon Club}was        
 formed in 1946.Today there are        
 approximatly{20 members.}It meets in  
 an old shed at the back of the{Old    
{Crown}across from the Post Office.The 
 pigeons are usually collected on a    
 Friday but are released, or liberated,
 as it is called, on the Saturday if   
 the weather is suitable.Before the    
 race each person enters the details of
 their particular pigeon;the breed,    
 ring number,and whether the bird is a 
 cock or a hen. The pigeon is given a  
 cod liver oil tablet on the Thursday  
 and another one just before the race. 
 Usually the race begins in{France}and 
 finishes when the bird reaches its    
 home loft. The pigeons are trained    
 from Ravensfield.They are collected   
 by the{Pigeon Federation Transporter, 
 which is a large lorry specially      
 designed to carry pigeons.            </content>
