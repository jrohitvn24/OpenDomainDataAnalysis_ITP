		<title>11YOUNG CHILDREN's HOBBIES</title>
		<content> Some children said:-                  
{I go to the Marian Jepson's dancing   
{class in Oldham for modern and ballet.
{I like dancing because it gets you fit
{and sometimes it's funny.             
 My hobby is collecting bookmarks. I   
 have 39 in all. I have got bookmarks  
 from Scotland, Wales, England and     
 Buxton. I have a few old ones         
 including one of the Lord's supper.   
{My hobby is playing the piano. I have 
{my music lesson every Tuesday for a   
{half hour but my lesson usually takes 
{longer because my mum talks for about 
{10 minutes while she drinks her tea.  
 I like motorbikes because I have got a
 50cc Italjet. It goes about 45 mph. My
 favourite place has been banned       
 because they are building houses there
 and the police have warned us it is   
 private land.
