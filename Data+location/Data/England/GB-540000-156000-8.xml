		<title>08PUDDLING,TATSFIELD POND.</title>
		<content>The village pond was dry and all untidy
and the village had a meeting in the   
hall and they decided to get some men  
to help them.And this is where the fun 
came.Daddy let me help him and there   
was a digger and a big lorry to bring  
in the clay.We put the clay in the     
bottom of the pond and trod on it with 
our boots on.This was called PUDDLING. 
I fell in and got covered with clay on 
the side and then we put some straw on.
Then the fire engine came to fill it up
with water.The village is going to buy 
some new ducks to go in the new pond   
because the others were taken by foxes.
