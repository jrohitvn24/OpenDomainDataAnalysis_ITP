		<title>08Women's groups in Bookham</title>
		<content> Local women strongly support 7 Women's
 Institutes, a W.I.market, a Housewives
 Register, 2 Townswomen's Guilds, 5    
 Church Groups and a mother and toddler
 group.                                
                                       
 These offer social and educational    
 opportunities for women through talks,
 classes, discussions, music, drama,   
 sport and other activities.  They     
 participate in local community        
 projects, helping the elderly and     
 young, supporting and improving       
 facilities.  Many also take action    
 over wider national and international 
 issues.                               
 Many of their members are working     
 women rather than isolated housewives,
 but the popularity of such groups     
 shows a continuing need for           
 opportunities for women outside work  
 and home.                             </content>
