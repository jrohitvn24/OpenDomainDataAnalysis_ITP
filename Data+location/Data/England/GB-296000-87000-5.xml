		<title>05TOPSHAM CHURCHES</title>
		<content> Topsham has two chapels by the        
 cemetary at Sunhill Avenue, and four  
 churches: St. Margaret's (Church of   
 England), St. Nicholas' (Methodist),  
 The Church of the Holy Cross          
 (Catholic), and a congregational      
 church in Victoria road. From St.     
 Margaret's church tower you can see   
 across the river Exe to Exminster. In 
 the churchyard are buried some of the 
 crew of HMS Victory. The church is    
 built in the shape of a cross and has 
 had parts added over the years. The   
 tower is built of sandstone and the   
 clock was put in for the Queen's      
 diamond jubilee in 1897. One of the   
 corner stones was laid on December 9th
 1874 by Sir J.T.B. Duckworth. A       
 memorial stone remembers 23 Topsham   
 people who died in the first world war
 and 39 people from the second world   
 war.                                  </content>
