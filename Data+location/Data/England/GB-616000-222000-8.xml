		<title>08TRAFFIC IN THORPE-LE-SOKEN.</title>
		<content> WHEN MRS. WRIGHT, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
 PARISH COUNCIL, CAME TO TALK TO CLASS 
 5 SHE TOLD US THAT THE BIGGEST CHANGE 
 SHE HAD SEEN DURING THE 59 YEARS SHE  
 HAD LIVED IN THORPE-LE-SOKEN WAS THE  
 AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC COMING THROUGH THE  
 VILLAGE. ON WEDNESDAY I COUNTED THE   
 TRAFFIC THAT WENT PAST MY HOUSE IN THE
 HIGH STREET FOR 15 MINUTES FROM       
 8.30a.m. THERE WERE 111 CARS, 12      
 LORRIES, 14 VANS, 3 COACHES, 1 BUS, 1 
 TRACTOR, 2 MOTORBIKES AND 3 BICYCLES, 
 A TOTAL OF 147 VEHICLES! PLANS HAVE   
 BEEN PASSED FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
 NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION WHICH WILL   
 MEAN EVEN MORE TRAFFIC, ESPECIALLY    
 LORRIES, PASSING THROUGH OUR VILLAGE. 
 THE ENORMOUS TRANSPORTERS WHICH CARRY 
 UP TO 8 CARS MAKE THE PAVEMENTS SHAKE.
 NO WONDER MRS. WRIGHT SAID THE CHANGE 
 SHE WOULD MOST LIKE TO SEE IS A BYPASS
 FOR THORPE-LE-SOKEN.                  </content>
