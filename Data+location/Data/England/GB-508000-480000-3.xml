		<title>03Filey Fishing Festival.</title>
		<content>   The Annual Fishing Festival takes   
 place during the first week in        
 September.All the cobles are involved 
 in this for only a week.The highest   
 total weight,the heaviest weight      
 and a sealed weight are fished for    
 prizes and cups.                      
   Some of the old fishing family names
 are still fishing out of              
 Filey:_Jenkinsons,Cammish,Cappleman,  
 Johnson and Wyvill.While the younger  
 fishermen have brought new names to   
 the fishing industry:-Adams,Barr,     
 Smith,Kennedy and Wilkes.This is most 
 interesting as in the past it was     
 traditionally  passed from father     
 to son,but now there is new 'blood'   
 coming into Filey's fishing industry.
