		<title>02Housing_ Old Hall Estate</title>
		<content>  The Old Hall Estate is a housing     
 estate built on the site of Bentley   
 Hall where Charles 2nd hid on his     
 flight from the battle of Worcester in
 1651.                                 
  Lee Arnold writes " I am 11 years    
 old, I am a boy and  I live at 9,     
 Berley Close, Old Hall Estate,Bentley 
 Walsall. The estate has changed since 
 it was built in 1979. There is now a  
 shop, a community centre and a doctors
 surgery. The council are talking about
 building a pub but it seems unlikely  
 to happen. The estate is good and I   
 like the pool. My brother Craig goes  
 fishing there alot. At the back of the
 houses there is an old railway line   
 but it has been dismantled. Now they  
 are filling it in with rubbish and    
 dirt. Past the dismantled railway     
 there is a school called Willenhall   
 Comprehensive. I  like the estate.    </content>
