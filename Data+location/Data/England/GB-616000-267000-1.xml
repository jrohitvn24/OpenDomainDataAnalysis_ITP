		<content> The block is an active farming area,  
 very lightly wooded with few hedges   
 and generally scattered houses. The   
 landscape is flat giving open views   
 over considerable distances.          
 Production is largely cereals, sugar  
 beet, rape, peas and beans, and a     
 small number if intensively reared    
 cattle. The villages of Bedingfield,  
 Rishangles and Southolt are small and 
 scattered. Most people are directly ot
 indirectly engaged in agriculture, a  
 few work outside the area and of the  
 retired people most are local, but a  
 few have come from outside. There are 
 no schools, two small shops, one pub  
 and of the three churches, Southolt   
 and Rishangles are closed. Services   
 are held at Bedingfield and also at   
 the Baptist chapel at Rishangles.

 one car, there is a tendancy for many </content>
