		<content> FOUR OF THE VILLAGES HAVE A BUS       
 SERVICE. THE ROUTE FROM MIDDLESBROUGH 
 TO LINGDALE PASSES THROUGH SLAPEWATH, 
 CHARLTON AND MARGROVE PARK, AND THE   
 SCARBOROUGH BUS PASSES THROUGH        
 STANGHOW. THE SERVICE TO LINGDALE IS  
 HALF HOURLY AT PEAK TIMES, BUT LESS   
 FREQUENT IN THE EVENINGS AND ON       
 SUNDAYS. THE SERVICE TO STANGHOW IS   
 LIMITED. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED AT THE  
 EFFECT OF PRIVATIZATION ON SERVICES   
 AND ON CONCESSIONARY FARES, WHICH     
 APPLY TO THE UNEMPLOYED AND ELDERLY.  
 BUSES ARE WELL USED. CARS ARE USED BY 
 LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE POPULATION,  
 AND MANY OF THE CARS IN USE ARE       
 OLD.MOST PEOPLE IN STANGHOW AND       
 AYSDALE GATE HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR,    
 BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PUBLIC         
 TRANSPORT.
