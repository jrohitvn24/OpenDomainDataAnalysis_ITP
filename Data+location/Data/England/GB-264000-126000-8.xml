		<content> Lady Margaret Fortescue interview     
 continued.                            
 Lady Margaret enjoyed school as she   
 hadn't been to school until she was   
 fifteen.  She made alot of friends and
 thought school was fun.  There were   
 about 150 children in her Swiss school
 and about the same in her English one.
 The main subjects she was taught were:
 English, French, German, Maths,       
 Geography, History, Literature and    
 Spelling.  Her favourite subjects were
 History and Literature and she hated  
 German and Maths. She did             
 three-quarters of an hour homework    
 after tea every day.                  
 Her childhood was different in that   
 everyone was more strict.             
 Castle Hill was started to be built in
 1729, and it was finished in 1740.  It
 took eleven years to build, and was   
 built by Hugh Fortescue.              </content>
