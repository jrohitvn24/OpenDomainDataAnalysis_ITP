 We had to do a survey on games        
 children play outside,to try to see   
 which is the most popular outdoor     
 game. So we went round the whole      
 school, and picked 3 boys and         
 3 girls from every class and asked    
 them what their most favourite outdoor
 game was.{Football}was first          
 favourite,{skipping}was second        
 favourite, and{rounders}was third .   
 Netball was fourth favourite and      
 running was fifth favourite.British   
 Bulldog, Cops and Robbers ,War,       
 Leapfrog, cricket and tennis were     
 liked by 2 people each.               
 Horse Riding, Sticky Toffee, Hide n   
 Seek, Marbles, Kiss Chase and         
 bike riding were all liked by 1 person
 each.
