 Lee Side. My grand parents and great  
 grand parents live opposite us. We    
 have one pet, a dog. Also my great    
 grandad has some chickens. We have 2  
 acres of land,\ acre is used for      
 growing vegetables and the rest is a  
 paddock.                              
 At weekends we usually go to          
 Barnstaple,it takes 20 minutes by car.
 If we don't go to town at weekends I  
 usually play with my friends.Mum      
 usually watches my sister while Dad   
 does some gardening. My nan has 3     
 greenhouses and sometimes I help her. 
 On sundays I go to church for an hour 
 then I come back and play with my bow 
 and arrows.                           </content>
