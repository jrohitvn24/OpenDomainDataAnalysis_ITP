		<title>16Playground Games</title>
		<content> The low walls in playground are used  
 for a variety of games.The most       
 popular boys'game is called           
 "Sharks".The idea for it came from    
 the                                   
 film"Jaws".The pavement becomes the   
 sea and one child patrols there       
 pretending to be a shark.Sometimes one
 child is 'sacrificed'  by the rest who
 throw him into the water.If caught you
 then become the shark.                
 The girls'favourite is "Eggy          
 Peggy"which involves standing in a    
 line facing tha person who is on(A).A 
 rhyme is chanted and then a subject   
 chosen, for examle, colour.Unknown to 
 (A) each child is given a colour. The 
 child whose colour that is, has to hop
 to (A),who also hops.They try to knock
 each other off balance and the last   
 one to put their foot down is on.
