		<title>05Ryde Pier</title>
		<content>  The pier is really two separate      
 piers.They are about 700 metres long. 
 The Eastern part carries a two track, 
 standard gauge railway line with a    
 station at the head of the pier.One of
 the tracks is used for a shuttle train
 which goes from the boats to the      
 Esplanade where there is a bus        
 station. The other is used by trains  
 running through to the resorts of     
 Sandown and Shanklin where the line   
 now ends.                             
  The other part of the pier has a     
 wooden surface and cars use this to   
 drive up to the pierhead to meet      
 passengers or to park. There used to  
 be a tram running between these two   
 parts of the pier but this is now     
 closed.                               
  Fishermen use the pier.
