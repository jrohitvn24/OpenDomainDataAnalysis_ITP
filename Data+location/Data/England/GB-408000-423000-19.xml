		<content>  In Southowram,people use buses for   
 going shopping and getting to work.   
 There are a lot of cars using the main
 road after breakfast, and before tea  
 when people are travelling to and from
 work.In the daytime there are fewer   
 cars except at the end of school,when 
 some children get lifts home.On the   
 main road there are delivery vans     
 bringing things to the shops in the   
 day and some heavy lorries bringing   
 loads fron the brick works and        
 concrete divisions of Marshall's.     
 Sometimes lorries bring food to the   
 school canteen kitchen and the dustbin
 lorry takes away rubbish once a week. 
 The milkman brings bottles of milk for
 the infants every day.There are also  
 post-office,telephone,electricity and 
 gas vans passing through the village. 
 Once a week a car comes from the      
 education department bringing letters.</content>
