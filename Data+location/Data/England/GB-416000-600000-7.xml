		<content> I am a grandmother.I started school 56
 years ago aged 5 and left at 14.There 
 were 4 classrooms heated by a free    
 standing coke fire.We could buy       
 Horlicks tablets to suck or make into 
 a hot drink.I went home for lunch     
 other children brought packed         
 lunches.At first we wrote on slate    
 boards with chalk.We danced round a   
 Maypole to a man playing a fiddle.We  
 grew fruit and vegetables which we put
 on a barrow and sold round the houses 
 for school funds.On Sports Day we went
 to Duridge Bay on straw covered flat  
 carts drawn by horses.We took a mug   
 and were given tea and a bag of       
 buns.Money was given as prizes.If you 
 won a sixpenny or threepenny piece(old
 currency)you felt very rich because   
 your pocket money was only a penny a  
 week.I enjoyed Sports Day very much.
