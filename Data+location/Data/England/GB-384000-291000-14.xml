for the day many of us  do not stay  at
home. We may go into the garden or  out
to a restaurant or club  ,to the  bingo
hall, social club or pub,enjoy hobbies,
sport or take part in an activity.     
  For the young there are many packs of
Brownies, Guides, Cubs and Scouts. Four
youth clubs and two other church groups
cater for the 7 to 18 age range.       
  Adult  activities  take place  during
the day at both the Civic and Community
Centres.  There  are several  nurseries
for mothers and toddlers, a twins club,
keep-fit classes, Rotary and many more.

over 80 activities. Winemaking,Woodwork
