		<title>01The Parish of Cockerham</title>
		<content>  The Parish of Cockerham is a pleasant
 rural area,composed of the main       
 village street with a Butchers        
 shop,General store &amp; Post Office,Manor
 Inn &amp; Bumbles restaurant.The Parish   
 Hall,School &amp; Police Station are also 
 along the main street,mixed with      
 houses old &amp; new.Moving West from the 
 village, St.Michaels Church,with its  
 ancient Tower,is conspicuous on the   
 high ground.Further along is another  
 cluster of cottages &amp; council houses. 
 Farming is mainly dairying with some  
 sheep,beef,arable &amp; int.pig &amp; hens.The
 caravan sites,canal &amp; Parachute centre
 provide leisure activities.The River  
 Cocker meanders across the area and   
 under a new road bridge,part of the   
 sea defence wall,which was built in   
 1971,when the river level was lowered 
 to improve drainage.Fish are at times 
 caught but pollution sometimes occurs.</content>
