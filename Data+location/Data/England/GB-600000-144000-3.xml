		<title>03 HOMELIFE IN KENNINGTON-1</title>
		<content> On Saturday l wake up between 8.00 and
 8.30am and l read my book for an hour.
 Then l get up, get on my jeans and    
 jumper and go downstaris for          
 breakfast, which consists of Cornflake
 s, a piece of toast, which we cook    
 under the grill and either lemonade or
 Cola for a drink. My brothers have    
 nearly the same for breakfast and my  
 Mum and dad have an egg and some      
 toast. Afterwards l have my wash and  
 go into the front room to watch the   
 television until my Dad is ready to   
 take me to town. When l go to town    
 with my dad or my whole family, we    
 first go to the market. When we leave 
 the market we go to Ashford Library so
 l can change my books and then we go  
 to the big Tescos. We park in the car 
 park and we buy all the necessary     
 things for a week, like sugar, butter,
 eggs and bread.                       </content>
