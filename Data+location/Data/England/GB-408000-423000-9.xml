		<content>   Most of the housing in Halifax is   
 old terraces,located close to the town
 centre,stretching towards the west.   
 There are large council estates in    
 Mixenden and Illingworth,to the north 
 of the town,and modern private housing
 around the old terraces in the west,  
 around Pellon.                        
 There are 3 types of housing in       
 Southowram;the council housing built  
 after the war,the semi- detached      
 houses built between the wars and the 
 old village housing,built in the 18th 
 century.Some cottages and farms date  
 back to the 17th century and the      
 school was built in 1876.    Under    
 Southowram,there are a lot of disused 
 mine shafts which were dug in the     
 18th century to get coal.Subsidence in
 the area is a large problem.Nobody    
 knows exactly where the shafts are or 
 how many there are.                   </content>
