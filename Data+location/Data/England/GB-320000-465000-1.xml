		<title>01ENERGY-GAS-MORECAMBE BAY.</title>
		<content> Off the South Cumbrian coast lies the 
 Morecambe gasfield.The field contains 
 an estimated 140,000 million cubic    
 metres of gas,making it one of the    
 largest gasfield around the shores of 
 Britain.                              
   The Morecambe field will be         
 especially important in meeting the   
 future needs of gas customers         
 throughout Britain.Unlike other fields
 Morecambe was discovered and is being 
 developed by a company-Hydrocarbons   
 Great Britain Limited-which is owned  
 by British Gas.                       
   First suplies of the Morecambe gas  
 came  in the winter of 1984/5.In      
 the late 1980's.When the Morecambe    
 field is at it's peak there will be   
 ten percent extra than the sufficient 
 amount of the demand at that time.The 
 gas will supply no less than seven    
 million central heating systems.      </content>
