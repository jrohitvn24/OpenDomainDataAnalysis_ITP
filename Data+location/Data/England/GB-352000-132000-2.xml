		<title>02TRANSPORT IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>    There is, in 1985, a twice weekly  
 bus service on Tuesday and Thursday   
 mornings which goes through Butleigh  
 and Baltonsborough to Street and      
 Glastonbury allowing roughly two hours
 for shopping. As this is the only     
 public transport, people without cars 
 are restricted in their movements. If 
 you wanted to go to London by train   
 you would have to go to Castle Cary,  
 about ten miles away across country.  
 If you wanted to go anywhere else by  
 train you would have to go to Bristol 
 or Bath, both about twenty eight miles
 away.                                 
    There are two Taxi services in     
 Butleigh and one in Baltonsborough.   
 Baltonsborough has a Black Book where 
 someone who was going to Street, for  
 example, would ring up and offer a    
 lift to someone who hasn't got a car.
