		<content>{ Withybrook}is about 8 miles from     
{Coventry,Nuneaton and Rugby.}A brook, 
 around which grow willow trees, gives 
 the village its name.The first records
 of Withybrook were made in the 12th   
 century when it started to grow becase
 of the neighbouring village of{Hopford
 which was wiped out by the plague.    
  The village also has a spring which  
 joins the brook.The spring has never  
 stopped flowing.Its water is so pure  
 that many people prefer it to tapwater
 for drinking.                         
  The village is in Coventry's green   
 belt.It is mainly farming land,with   
 farms coming to the centre of the     
 village.The soil is crumbly loam,with 
 a pH.of 6.5 to 7.0.                   
   Two old buildings remain,the church 
 and an old cottage.This was restored  
 by{Mr &amp; Mrs Lucas.}Mr Lucas was the   
 local black smith.                    </content>
