		<title>19DARTMOUTH'S HINTERLAND (1)</title>
		<content>   Dartmouth is situated in a{rural    
{area}where farming has had a major    
 impact upon the landscape.            
   Although the emphasis is upon dairy 
 farming and crops such as wheat and   
 barley, there is a growing importance 
 in{fruit farming.}Capton Fruit Farm is
 a good example, where a great variety 
 of fruit is grown, mainly for sale in 
 Dartmouth shops but also providing a  
{"pick your own"}service. Examples of  
 fruit grown include strawberries,     
 raspberries, gooseberries, rhubarb,   
 logenberries and blackcurrents.       
   There is also a stong trend towards 
 the re-introduction of{grapes}to the  
 area. There was a vineyard near the   
 river before the{Second World War,    
 which supplied{Covent Garden}by boat  
 to Kingswear and then by G.W.R. to    
 London. This vineyard declined during 
 the war due to a lack of man power.   </content>
