		<title>20MARAZION MEETING HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Friends' Meeting House was built  
 in 1688, and is the oldest public     
 building in Marazion. Although closed 
 for part of its history, meetings for 
 worship have been held regularly since
 1918.                                 
 The{Society of Friends}is sometimes   
 called{"Quakers".}It is a Christian   
 group, rather than a church. Quakers  
 meet for prayer, but they do not have 
 baptism or communion or ministers.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
 These Domesday entries were compiled
