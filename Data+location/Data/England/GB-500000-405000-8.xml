		<content> There are nine farm sites.  Some are  
 part of larger concerns, or are on    
 more than one site, with shared labour
 and machinery.  Most farms had betwen 
 three and six tractor units, with     
 varying supplementary machinery       
 depending on soil type or crop.  {    
{Acreage}varied from seven to seven    
 hundred and fifty acres.  {Soil types 
 were mixtures of deposits of sand and 
 medium loam, overlapping with heavy   
 boulder clay.  Most farms are about { 
{9O% arable. }Crops grown are wheat,   
 barley, oilseed rape, sugar beet,     
 peas, potatoes, with some grass grown 
 largely as a cash crop.  Livestock are
 noticeably secondary to arable        
 farming.  Two farms keep l2O - 35O    
 ewes, another had 70 bulls and 40     
 geese.Visits to the stockmarket seem  
 infrequent,but occur mostly in early  
 summer to sell lambs.                 </content>
