		<content> Mr and Mrs G Trim. The nursery        
 covers five and a half acres. One     
 acre is greenhouses. It is mostly     
 wholesale. They grow tomatoes, bedding
 plants, geraniums, primroses and      
 chrysanthemums. Tomatoes, bedding     
 plants, and cut flowers are sold      
 locally or taken to Covent Garden.    
 They employ one full time worker and  
 eight part time ladies, usually in    
 spring. This is the machinery they    
 have: one small tractor with          
 accessories, a dump truck, a lorry,   
 rotovators, and tomato grader. Very   
 small tomatoes are called "chits", and
 are not to be sold. Heating used to be
 run by coal, but 15 years ago they    
 changed to oil. It costs Â£1200 a year 
 to heat the greenhouses and it is a   
 big worry for the Trims. Fewer        
 greenhouses will be heated this       
 year. They like their job.            </content>
