		<content> We interviewed some residents of      
 Exbourne who had lived there for      
 between sixty and eightyfive years.   
  In 1900 the village was independant, 
 with two butchers,bakers cobblers,a   
 blacksmith,a thatcher and a well      
 digger. Now there is only the combined
 Village stores and Post office.       
  In 1900, most people worked in the   
 village and there was a great         
 community spirit.Concerts were        
 held,the Churches were active.        
   Little changed until after 1945.    
 Telephones meant people no longer had 
 to visit others. Cars have brought    
 mobility,in work and entertainment.   
 Tractors and machinery have cut jobs. 
  In 1960 young people moved away to   
 work,the village was dying. In 1980,  
 new houses,too pricey for locals,have 
 brought new families,mostly commuters.
 Community spirit is fast disappearing.</content>
