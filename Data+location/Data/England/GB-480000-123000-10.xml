		<title>10Life styles in Rogate</title>
		<content>                                       
  One of the residents of East         
 Lodge told us of how life used to be  
 in Rogate when she used to keep the   
 White Horse public house.             
   All the food was fresh as they had  
 no refrigerators and they used candles
 and lamps to guide them to bed. When I
 go to sleep I cuddle down under the   
 quilt and switch off the electric     
 light just over my bed.               
   When the lady was at school she     
 wore a blue pinafore though she had   
 a white one for Sunday. Me, I wear  my
 school uniform some of the time, a    
 green pullover over a grey skirt, but 
 I also like to wear ordinary dresses. 
   She used to do  something called    
 drill outside in the playground, when 
 we do P E we can use the hall without 
 any shoes so we have both floor and   
 the large apparatus to explore.       </content>
