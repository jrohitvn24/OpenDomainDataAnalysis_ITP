		<title>05QUESTIONNAIRE - RUNCTON</title>
		<content> The children of North Mundham School  
 sent questionnaires to residents of   
 the part of Runcton contained within  
 our area.   Of the fifty              
 questionnaires sent out 33 households 
 returned them, which we thought was a 
 very good response, as at the moment  
 many people are worried about the     
 storage of information on computer    
 files.   In fact we found that the    
 local people were very interested in  
 this Domesday Project and only too    
 keen to answer the questions put to   
 them by the children.   The results of
 the Questionnaire are summarised on   
 the next few pages.   The fields      
 covered by the survey were chosen by  
 the children (eleven years old), being
 their ideas of what might be of       
 interest to future readers.
