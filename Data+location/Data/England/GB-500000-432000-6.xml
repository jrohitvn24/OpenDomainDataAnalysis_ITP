		<title>06Quarry Side Farm, Skidby.</title>
		<content>  Mr and Mrs Haskins own the farm,     
 which is 530 acres. The farmhouse is  
 on Main Street and the farmyard and   
 fields are behind this. They have 100 
 sheep, 130 bullocks and four dogs.    
 They have four tractors, a baler, a   
 Landrover, an elevator and other farm 
 machinery. There is a Dutch barn and a
 bullock shed which Mr Haskins and his 
 son built. There are fields of barley,
 oil seed rape, wheat and grass behind 
 the bullock shed, and also a disused  
 chalk quarry.                         
  The sheep are kept for their wool and
 have lambs every March. The bullocks  
 are bought when they are eight weeks  
 old and fattened for beef. The wheat  
 is grown to make flour, the barley is 
 used to make beer and the oil seed    
 rape is for cooking oil.              
  Their son and another man work there.
