		<title>04FARMING - LET AND PRIVATE</title>
		<content> There are 23 let farms varying in size
 up to 500 acres on the Englefield     
 Estate. Some of these are in this     
 area. Dairying and cereals are the    
 main enterprises, but there are also 3
 flocks of sheep and a number of pig   
 herds. Wickcroft Farm and part of     
 Bournfield Farm are examples of such  
 let property. In this area there are  
 several farms which are privately     
 owned. Malpas Farm has 80,000 chickens
 producing 63,500 eggs per day. These  
 are packed and distributed from Three 
 Mile Cross. The owner of Hewinswood   
 Farm works alone raising 2,000 pigs   
 for pork. Barn Elms is a mixed farm   
 growing wheat, barley, corriander,    
 calabrese and potatoes as well as 99  
 beef cattle. These are examples of    
 activities undertaken by private      
 farmers.
