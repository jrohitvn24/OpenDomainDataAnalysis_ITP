		<title>08Stambourne Dog Club</title>
		<content> The Stambourne Village Dog Club was   
 started in 1981 by Mr. Roy Hunter, a  
 former dog handler,inspector and      
 Deputy instructor in the Metropolitan 
 Police. Before he moved to this       
 village he had run seven dog clubs in 
 London.The Club started with one class
 of about 10 dogs and now has five     
 classes and about 40 dogs attend.     
 The dogs are taught basic obedience   
 and later agility.Some go on to learn 
 tracking.They do an eight week course.
 To begin the dogs are taught to sit,go
 down,stand,walk without pulling and   
 to come when called. It is the owners 
 who are really trained as they have to
 continue to train their dogs at home. 
 They are provided with homework sheets
 to help them do this.The owners come  
 from as far away as Haverhill,Earls   
 Colne,Harlow,Harwich,Clacton and      
 Colchester.                           </content>
