		<title>01Introduction to Hankham area</title>
		<content>                                       
 The main centre of population in the  
 area is the{Village of Hankham}.The   
 majority of the land is farmed and    
 consists to a large extent of low     
 lying marshland.Isolated farms are    
 scattered throughout the area with the
 occasional small cluster of dwellings.
   The higher sections of farmland are 
 used for cereal production.Most of the
 low lying land is used for sheep      
 grazing.There is a group of medium    
 sized dairy farms which remain in     
 defiance of the squeeze felt by the   
 introduction of E.E.C.milk quotas.    
   The low lying Pevensey Levels are   
 crossed by only a few roads which     
 means that disturbance of field life  
 is kept at a minimum.This area remains
 free from flooding because of a       
 drainage system maintained and        
 operated by Southern Water Authority.{</content>
