		<content> The area consists of the village of   
 Steeple Ashton and a small part of the
 village of Keevil.                    
 Steeple Ashton used to be a large town
 with a wool market;some ten thousand  
 people lived there until most of the  
 town was destroyed by fire in the     
 sixteenth century.The market then     
 moved away and, in spite of several   
 attempts to revive it, never returned 
 and Steeple Ashton became a small     
 village with a large church that had  
 been built by wealthy,local merchants 
 just before the fire took place.      
 Keevil is also an old village, both   
 villages were largely farming         
 communities but these days most of the
 people living there commute to nearby 
 towns to work.Steeple Ashton is       
 unusual in a village for the fact that
 it has a Magistrates Court which still
 functions.                            </content>
