		<content>   This Newtown square is a real       
 mixture of housing and schools(a First
 School,a Middle School,2 Secondary    
 Schools) an Allotment area and a      
 cemetery and not forgetting a playing 
 field (that's where we go for our     
 games lessons in school.)Most schools 
 in the area use these playing fields  
 as most of the schools haven't got any
 playing field space of their own.     
   Along the main road from Southampton
 there is a council estate and on the  
 main road a small Precinct of shops.  
 This main road leads out of           
 Southampton to the east and once      
 wasn't very busy but since the new    
 Itchen Bridge was opened (in 1977),   
 going straight into the centre of     
 town, the traffic is very bad in the  
 morning and evening.
