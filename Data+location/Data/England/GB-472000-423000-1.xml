		<title>01GOOLE - A BRIEF RESUME</title>
		<content>  Goole was founded as a "Company Town"
 by the Aire and Calder  Navigation    
 Company as a terminus for their{canal.
  The area is flat, only a few feet    
 above the tidal River Ouse. The two   
 other rivers (Aire and Don) make the  
{town}almost an island which occupies  
 about 25% of the block.               
  The block is well served by rail,    
 road, river and motorway links.       
  The remaining land of the block is   
 almost totally comprised of highly    
 fertile arable land producing a       
 variety of crops including wheat,     
 barley, potatoes and sugar-beet.      
  This area was formerly part of the   
 old West Riding of Yorkshire but since
 1974 has been in the administrative   
 county of Humberside.
