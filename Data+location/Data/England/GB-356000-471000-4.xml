   On the shingle banks of the R.Lune  
nest many oyster catchers. Lapwings are
plentiful along the river. They used to
live in the fields but have moved on to
the gravel beds of the river. There are
many common sand pipers and some curlew
along the river bank and in our part   
there is a Kingfisher. This year we    
went to look at a pair of mute swans   
nesting. Last week we saw them on a    
backwater with  one cygnet. There was  
a pair of roe deer last year by the    
railway viaduct. They had two young    
deer but these twins were killed on    
the railway bridge. We aren't sure     
whether the adults are still there.    
Twice a year, mainly during the night, 
our sleep is sometimes disturbed by    
strange sounds passing overhead, down  
and up the valley. They are flocks of  
geese migrating in formation.          </content>
