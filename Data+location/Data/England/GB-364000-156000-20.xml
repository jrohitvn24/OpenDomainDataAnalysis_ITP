 the miners walking to work along the  
 paths to the local pits.They left for 
  the first shift at 5.00 am, and      
 returned home at 2.00 pm.Then they    
 washed in their tin baths in front of 
 the fire,and later worked in their    
 allotments,where they grew all their  
 own vegetables.

 population of about 900.There were    
 more farms .
