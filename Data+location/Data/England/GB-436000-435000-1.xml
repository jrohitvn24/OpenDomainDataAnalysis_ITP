		<content>{**** Barwick in Elmet Maypole **** }  
 The Maypole Festival is triennial. The
 maypole is taken down on Easter       
 Tuesday, by the old fashioned way,    
 using ropes and ladders. It is 85 feet
 tall and is repainted white with      
 spiralling red and blue stripes. On   
 top of the maypole is a fox weather   
 vane which spins round in the wind.   
 Halfway up there are four garlands    
 which are made by different           
 organisations from the village. They  
 are made out of thousands of pieces of
 material, put into steel frames. The  
 new maypole is put up on Spring Bank  
 Holiday Tuesday after the festivities 
 in the evening. It is carried down by 
 hundreds of people shouldering it.    
 When it is vertical again, a volunteer
 climbs up and spins the fox.
