		<content>{A "30" TRUNK ROAD                     
 THE A30 MAIN ROAD GOES THROUGH THE    
 VILLAGES OF WEST COKER AND EAST       
 CHINNOCK.A COUNT OF VEHICLES SHOWED   
 420 IN 1 HOUR TO AND FROM YEOVIL,     
 CARS,VANS AND HEAVY GOODS VEHICLES.   
 IT CAN BE MUCH BUSIER AT PEAK PERIODS.
  BECAUSE THE A 30 IS SUCH A BUSY AND  
 NARROW ROAD THROUGH WEST COKER A BY_  
 PASS HAS BEEN PLANNED. THIS HAS BEEN  
 UNDER DISCUSSION SINCE 1934.          
  THE LATEST PLAN IS TO BUILD A NEW    
 ROAD JOINING THE EXISTING ROAD AT     
 ROUNDABOUTS 1 MILE WEST OF THE VILLAGE
 AND AT COKER BRIDGE TO THE EAST.      
 THE ESTIMATED COST IS ABOUT Â£3,000,000
  THIS WOULD MAKE THE VILLAGE MUCH     
 SAFER &amp; MOST PEOPLE FAVOUR THIS BUT   
 OTHERS FEAR IT WILL AFFECT THEIR      
 BUISNESS.IT WOULD ALSO AFFECT THE     
 OWNER OF BARTON FARM WHOSE LAND WOULD 
 BE USED FOR THE ROAD.                 </content>
