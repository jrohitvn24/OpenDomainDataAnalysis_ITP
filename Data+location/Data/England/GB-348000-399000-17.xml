		<title>17 CRANK WALKING DAY</title>
		<content>  Walking Day started when the village 
people walked round the edge of their  
village.Later it was used by the Church
for the people to show their Christian 
faith.                                 
  Walking Day takes place annually on a
Saturday in July and the procession is 
accompanied by one or two brass bands. 
The children wear their best clothes   
and the girls usually carry baskets of 
flowers.Many village people walk down  
to King's Moss with the primary school 
children.Refreshments are served there,
after which the infants are driven back
to school on a decorated trailer.At    
school the children have tea and then  
change into games kit.There are races  
on the field,mainly for the children,  
but also for the adults.There are many 
stalls set up on the field and the race
prize-money is quickly spent.Most      
people begin to leave at about 6:00pm. </content>
