		<title>16SERVICES IN LANDRAKE</title>
		<content> Many essential services have to be    
 brought to the village.All homes have 
 electricity which was not true in the 
 1950's.As the village is cut in two by
 the A38 road,when there is a power    
 failure it does not last long because 
 the lighting on the main road has to  
 be quickly switched back on.          
 There is no gas supplied,though the   
 actual gas main runs less than a mile 
 away.Heating therefore for homes is   
 electricity,solid fuel,oil or Calor   
 gas.Both the last two must be brought 
 in by tanker,usually from Plymouth.   
 Deliveries of solid fuel are made on a
 regular basis during winter months by 
 two coal merchants from Saltash and   
 one from Looe.                        
 Landrake telephone numbers have still 
 only 3 figures,but there are plans to 
 build a new telephone exchange nearby 
 which may change to 6 figures.        </content>
