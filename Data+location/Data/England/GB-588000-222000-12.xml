		<title>12THE PEOPLE OF MARKS TEY - 11</title>
		<content> is in a{dangerous}position because of 
 the road. More people would use the   
 playing field if it was on the{estate.
                (T.Morris &amp; N.Clement) 
{RELIGION.}We found out that {90% }of  
 the People in Mark's Tey belong to the
 Church of England.Of the {200} people 
 we asked this was{180} people.Seven   
 people{(3\%)}belong to the Methodist  
 Church and three people{(1\%)}belong  
 to the Roman Catholic Church.We also  
 found that 10 people{(5\%)}belong to  
 some other religious group.33 are     
 regular church attenders but only 24  
 people{(12%)}go regularly to Marks Tey
 Church.This tells us that of the 180  
 people we asked who say they belong to
 the Church of England,many must not   
 have very strong religious feelings   
 because if they had they would        
 probably go to church more often.
