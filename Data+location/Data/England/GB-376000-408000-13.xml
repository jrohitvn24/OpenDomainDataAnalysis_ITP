		<content> An annual{custom}is the making of{    
{pancakes,}which we eat on Shrove      
 Tuesday in February.It originated when
 people used to mix fats,eggs and flour
 just before{Lent}so they could get rid
 of their rich food.Shrove Tuesday     
 depends on the time of Easter Day,    
 which is fixed by the movement of the 
 moon.                                 
 At{Easter}it is{customary}for         
 relations and friends to give you     
 chocolate eggs.Most people do not eat 
 them until Easter Day.                
 Another custom we have is{Bonfire     
{Night}which is on November fifth. Most
 people light a bonfire or go and watch
 a firework display.We have Bonfire    
 Night to remember the time when{Guy   
{Fawkes}tried to blow up{Parliament,}  
 but soldiers caught him and he was    
 executed.
