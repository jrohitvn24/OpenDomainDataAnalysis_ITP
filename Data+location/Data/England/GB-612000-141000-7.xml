		<content> At Sibton Park the ground is always   
 kept in good condition and there is a 
 wide variety of mowers and rollers.   
 Quite often I drive the diesel roller 
 and flatten the wicket ready for the  
 next match. There is also a very large
 mower for cutting the whole pitch     
 fairly quickly. It has a roller with a
 seat attached to the back so that the 
 mower can go at a speed of about seven
 miles per hour without the person     
 using it having to run. They have got 
 a mini tractor fitted with grass      
 cutting equipment. The land that      
 Sibton Park Cricket Club used to      
 belong to Mr &amp; Mrs Ridley-Day.
