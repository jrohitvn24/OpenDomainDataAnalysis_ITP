		<content> My alarm clock wakes me up at quarter 
 to eight.I wash my face, brush my     
 teeth, dress, have some cereal for    
 breakfast,and travel to school. When  
 we get to school I wait for my friend 
 Dean to come. We talk until the       
 whistle goes and chatter all the way  
 up the stairs. The teacher calls the  
 register, some people go to computer  
 while we do some maths. Often the     
 teacher reads the next chapter of our 
 story. After a playtime of fifteen    
 minutes, we do english. The entire    
 school assembles in the hall for the  
 Thursday Show - news,acts and quizzes.
 At twelve o'clock pupils go home, stay
 for school dinners or eat sandwiches. 
 We have an "art afternoon" painting,  
 drawing &amp; colouring. There is another 
 fifteen minutes break. After the last 
 lesson we go home.{
