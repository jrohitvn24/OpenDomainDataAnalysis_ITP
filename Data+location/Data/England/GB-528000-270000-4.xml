		<title>04Mill Warden, Houghton</title>
		<content> The Warden has worked with the        
 National Trust for three years and    
 likes working at the Mill. The        
 qualifications he needs for this job  
 are, understanding the mill and       
 enjoying meeting people. His job      
 involves looking after the building,  
 selling tickets, making sure that     
 everything is clean and looking at    
 membership cards. The last time the   
 mill actually worked was 55 years ago,
 in 1930, when it ground 9 tons a day. 
 The present mill was built in the 17th
 century and they hope to have it      
 working again soon. Instead of the    
 water wheel turning it they will use  
 electric motors. There were 8,000     
 visitors last year. The public like   
 the mill and would like to see a real 
 water wheel but this would cost       
 Â£100,000.
