		<content> Barnsley is situated far from the sea 
 but has a good road and rail network. 
 The centre boasts a busy bus station  
 where links to many parts of Britain  
 can be made. Our railway station      
 stands on the main Leeds to Sheffield 
 line and carries both people and      
 freight. Despite the closure of many  
 pits in our area we still counted more
 coal waggons than any other.          
    The west side of Barnsley touches  
 the motorway (M1) at three            
 intersections and has easy access to  
 Hull, Manchester and London. There is 
 an industrial estate at Platt's Common
 which is very close to the M1 and has 
 been developed because of this. By    
 comparing maps we have noticed that   
 the roads around Barnsley have        
 changed. Most of the traffic is now   
 diverted away from the centre and that
 which does enter is channelled one way</content>
