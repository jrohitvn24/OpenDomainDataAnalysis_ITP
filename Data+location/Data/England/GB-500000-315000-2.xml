		<content> The southern part of Little Bytham    
 lies within this block, about 54      
 houses in all. The oldest houses      
 are mostly built of local limestone   
 (there are several quarries nearby),  
 roofed with stone slates or pantiles. 
 Later building was done in red brick  
 (from the local brickyard, now closed,
 or Peterborough), tiled or pantiled.  
 Most recent building has been done in 
 various types of brick.               
  The old nucleus of the village lies  
 west of the railway, with outlying    
 farms to south and east.              
  To the south the narrow strip of land
 between the railway and the B1176 has 
 gradually been filled in with housing 
 and light industrial premises, almost 
 as far as the old station, opposite   
 which is a pub (formerly the Station  
 Hotel), a factory and some small semi-
 detached cottages.                    </content>
