		<title>11SWIMMING BATHS</title>
		<content> I think that there should be a        
 swimming baths in Lundwood because a  
 lot of the people who live here like  
 to go the baths and have to go to     
 Barnsley.                             
 I think that there should be a cinema 
 as well because although most people  
 have videos they prefer to watch it at
 the cinema.  It would also cut down   
 the massive queues at Barnsley.       
 I think there should be an Amusement  
 Park in Lundwood because it would give
 you something to do during school     
 holidays.
