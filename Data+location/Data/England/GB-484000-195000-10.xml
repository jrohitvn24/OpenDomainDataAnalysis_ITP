		<content>    Although the national unemployment 
rate is high,this area does not follow 
the trend.From our sample 175 families 
only 2 fathers are without work.As     
this is in the commuter belt about half
the men work more than 10 miles away   
from home.63% of the mothers work but  
mostly within a 3 miles radius.        
    About 70% of all workers go to work
by car,17% are within walking distance,
nearly 13% travel by public transport  
while 2 people regularly cycle.        
    A high proportion of men hold      
managerial,executive and professional  
posts or are skilled artisans.Only 16  
in our survey are engaged in the       
traditional furniture trade and one in 
the once prosperous High Wycombe based 
paper-making industry.                 
    The women are mainly in clerical or
retail work or are teachers,nurses,home
helps,supervisors or kitchen workers.  </content>
