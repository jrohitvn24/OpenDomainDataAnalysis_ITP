    I live at Mill House. My Daddy says
the mill was built about 1840. It was  
used to grind corn into flour. Its     
proper name was a Suffolk Post Mill    
because a large post supported the top 
part of the mill and the sails. The    
whole top part of the mill could be    
turned on the post to make the sails   
face the wind.My Daddy thinks it had   
four sails and two grinding wheels. We 
still have a small piece of one of the 
Mill stones in our garden. The sails   
and the top part of the mill were taken
down about 1923. My Grandad put a roof 
on the brick base, called the          
roundhouse, which is still in our      
garden.The house we live in was built  
about the same time as the Mill, as a  
home for the Miller and his family.
