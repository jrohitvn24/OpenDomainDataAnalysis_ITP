		<title>14Communications in Sebergham</title>
		<content>    Communications are perhaps less now
 than in earlier times, with more cars 
 people walk through and between the   
 villages less and consequently meet   
 each other less.  This is very        
 detrimental to the cohesion of the    
 community.                            
    Telephones are in virtually every  
 house and are used very much for keep-
 ing in touch with friends and family. 
    Old divisions between the Church of
 England and the Methodists are slowly 
 giving way to a more understanding    
 oecumenical attitude between people of
 different creeds.  Methodists attend  
 the Church of England services more   
 readily than the reverse.  Attendances
 at church and chapel are declining    
 both with more easily available       
 transport and less resident ministers 
 to keep the church alive.
