 The Christingle Service has been      
 celebrated at the Church of St. Mary  
 for 8 years. The Children's Society   
 first started the service here        
 although the ceremony first started in
 Bohemia. People go to church and      
 listen to the Studham School children 
 taking the service.                   
 I was Mary last year. I enjoyed taking
 part.Father John gives all the        
 children oranges which represent the  
 world.The oranges have red bands      
 around the middle which represent the 
 equator. The oranges also have 4      
 cocktail sticks in them with nuts and 
 sweets.There is a short white candle  
 in the middle.                        
 The sticks represent the 4 corners of 
 the earth and the candle represents   
 the light of the world. Kelly and     
 Kirsty                                </content>
