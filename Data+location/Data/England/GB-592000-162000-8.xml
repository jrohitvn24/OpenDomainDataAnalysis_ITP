 Breakdance is the latest dance craze  
 from the United States of America and 
 it is very popular amongst the child- 
 ren of Murston. It dates from 1975    
 and is a development from bodypopping 
 which is a form of street dancing. A  
 group of breakdancers is called a crew
 and the Murston children belong to    
 various local crews, with such exotic 
 names as Tec Tronic, Freeze Force and 
 Time Zone. There is a great rivalry   
 between the local groups and their    
 impromptu competitions are called     
 burns. Our school has banned          
 breakdancing from the playground      
 because of accidents. The loud music  
 played in the streets often brings    
 complaints from local residents. This 
 is a pity because breakdancing is just
 good fun. A competition was held at   
 Murston Junior School's May Fair.     </content>
