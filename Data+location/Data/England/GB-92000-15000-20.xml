		<title>20ROYAL VISIT,ISLES OF SCILLY</title>
		<content>   On June 9th 1985 we went to the main
 island of St.Marys to see Her Majesty 
 the Queen Mother.The boat trip over   
 was very rough so we tried to keep dry
 in the cabin.We saw her go into the   
 Town Hall where the Councillors were  
 introduced by the Chairman of the     
 Council,Mr Roy Duncan.Later Mr.Duncan 
 introduced her to the seven children  
 in our school abd we gave her our     
 posies.After she had seen all the     
 school children Her Majesty the Queen 
 Mother went into the old peoples      
 home,a band was playing outside.After 
 that we went down to St.Marys quay and
 waited for the Queen Mother to board  
 the launch which took her back to the 
 Royal Yacht Britannia.When she had    
 left the quay we got onto the Black   
 Swan,and the boatman took us out to   
 see the Britannia,on out trip home to 
 St.Martins.                           </content>
