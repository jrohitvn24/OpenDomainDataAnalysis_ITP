		<content> The moor is part of the Morton moor   
 and the Bingley moor.The canal belongs
 to the Leeds to Liverpool canal.In    
 recent tests,we found that the canal  
 was slightly polluted,but it does seem
 to be getting worse little by little. 
 The only towns that the canal goes    
 through in our area are Micklethwaite 
 and Riddlesden.There is the A650 route
 road going through Crossflatts.       
 Ryshworth Middle School is the main   
 school in this area.It was built in   
 1973 and can hold 480 pupils.         
   Being situated near Bradford and    
 Leeds,it is slowly becoming a good    
 place for housing and business.
