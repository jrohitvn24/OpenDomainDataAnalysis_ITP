		<title>07    RED HOUSE REST HOME</title>
		<content> The Red House was originally connected
 with the farm next door when it was   
 built in 1785.  The bricks came from  
 the old Dumbleton brick works and a   
 lot of the old beams came from the    
 remains of Evesham Abbey.  During     
 World War 2 the house was a temporary 
 home for the soldiers who were going  
 to be dropped behind enemy lines.     
 The present owner, Mr Fearnett has    
 made a lot of changes, modernising it 
 with new showers, toilets, baths and  
 bedrooms.  There are at present 18    
 residents and 11 people are employed  
 there.  There are 15 rooms and it was 
 made into a  residential rest home in 
 1980.  Before it was converted into a 
 rest home it was a private dwelling.  
 The plot on which the Red House stands
 cover approx. 0.3 of an acre.
