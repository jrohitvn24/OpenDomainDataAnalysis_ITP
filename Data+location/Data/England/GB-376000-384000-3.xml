		<content>   The greatest single influence on the
 area has been the opening of the      
{Altrincham to Knutsford Railway}line  
 in 1862. Many residents at the time   
 opposed the opening of a station in   
 Hale. The immediate impact was to     
 stimulate housing development to      
 accomodate all classes of resident    
 esp. workers' cottages to the North of
 the Survey area. This then placed     
 pressure on church and school         
 provision. It was only after l908 that
 the Stamford Trustees agreed to permit
 their houses on Ashley Road to be     
 converted into shops. A few of the    
 older residents interviewed used to   
 own shops: of note were Southern's    
 bakers &lt;est.l820> and Schofield's     
 drapers &lt;est.l880>. A famous landmark 
 was{Peel Causeway,}cottages forming   
 part of the Railway Station and later 
{Siddeley's Brewery}before demolition. </content>
