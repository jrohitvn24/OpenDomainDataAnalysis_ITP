		<title>05PASS OFF PARADE</title>
		<content> We went to Helles Barracks the home of
 the 11th.Signal Regiment to watch the 
 Pass Off Parade;at the gates we were  
 met by a Corporal and escourted to our
 seats.The Parade Sergeant Major       
 ordered the six flag carrying markers 
 to march on ;as one of the Corporal   
 markers passed us he said,{"Hi Kids"}.
 A most deafening shriek came from the 
 Sgt.Major,but really he was calling   
 for the Regimental Band from Blandford
 to march on playing {Glorious Victory}
 .They were followed by three groups of
 recruits.The first group,in smart     
 uniforms and white belts,were the Pass
 Off troops who had completed 10 weeks 
 training.The other two groups had     
 completed 6 or 8 weeks training.They  
 marched around the square to {Holy    
{Rood},stopped,and stood at ease       
 waiting for the Inspecting Officer.It 
 was to be Brigadier Maynard.          </content>
