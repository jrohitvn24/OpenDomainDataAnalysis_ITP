 The Woodbridge Tide Mill is a         
beautiful white building overlooking   
the River Deben.                       
                                       
  The Tide Mill was made as an         
{economic way of grinding corn}. There 
has been a tide mill in Woodbridge     
since 1170.                            
                                       
 It has been owned by such people as   
King Henry the Eighth, Thomas          
Seckford and is now owned by the       
Woodbridge Tide Mill Trust.            
                                       
  It is powered by a water wheel 18    
foot in diameter which works all the   
machinery in the mill, including the   
pair of{ French burr stones} that grind
the corn. The granary stands nearby.
