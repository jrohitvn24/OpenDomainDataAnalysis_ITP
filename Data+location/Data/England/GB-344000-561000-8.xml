		<content> There is no school in the village now;
 children have to go to {Smithfield.}  
 The school building has become the    
 Parish Hall. The school closed in     
 1933. It took children from 5 to 14   
 years and had two teachers for the 45 
 to 60 pupils, and these were all      
 taught in one large room.             
 School started a 9 a.m. and finished  
 at 3.30 p.m. except on Fridays. Then  
 the finish was at 3p.m. to let        
 children get home to help their       
 parents get produce ready for market. 
 Each year in March there was an 11    
 plus examination to choose pupils for 
 grammar school. The School year       
 started in April.                     
 The only education for children in    
 Scaleby is the Playgroup which meets  
 in the Parish Hall.
