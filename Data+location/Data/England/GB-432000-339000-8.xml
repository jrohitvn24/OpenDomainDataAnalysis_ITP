		<content> THE AGE STRUCTURE OF ALLESTREE IS     
 QUITE UNUSUAL FOR THERE IS A HIGH     
 PROPORTION OF PEOPLE IN THE AGE GROUPS
 10_19 &amp; 60_74.THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE  
 AGE OF THE HOUSES &amp; THEIR STYLES.MOST 
 OF THE HOUSES DATE BACK NO FURTHER    
 THAN 20_25 YEARS,SO WHEN THEY WERE NEW
 THE GENERALLY RICHER "MIDDLE AGED"    
 GROUPS WOULD BE THE ONES THAT COULD   
 AFFORD THEM AND THEY ARE NOW ALL IN   
 THE 60_74 AGE GROUP.THE 10_19 AGE     
 GROUP IS SO LARGE BECAUSE THE COUPLES 
 MOVING INTO A LARGER HOUSE 20_25 YEARS
 AGO WOULD HAVE DONE SO WITH THE       
 INTENTION OF EXPANDING THEIR FAMILIES 
 &amp; THEY ARE THE RESULT.THE SMALLER     
 "MIDDLE AGED" GROUPS MAY BE SO BECAUSE
 THERE IS NOW, VERY LITTLE INCENTIVE   
 FOR THESE AGED PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO    
 THIS SORT OF AREA
