		<title>02SOUTHALL -EAST NEIGHBOURHOOD</title>
		<content>    Southall is my home town. I think  
 Southall is a balanced place. There   
 are lots of people of every different 
 religion. Some people who do not live 
 here think Southall is a bad place to 
 live in but I don't think I would     
 like to live anywhere else. You can   
 make lots of friends and there is a   
 lot of activities you can do,for      
 instance swimming or jogging in our   
 local parks. You can go to youth clubs
 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.            
     There is a custom,called Divali   
 which Asian people have yearly in     
 October or November. It is a festival 
 of light, and we celebrate it by      
 giving food to friends and relatives  
 and children and watching fireworks.  
     Most shops stay open late. Many   
 people have videos so people don't    
 have to go to the cinema.   S Dhillon,
