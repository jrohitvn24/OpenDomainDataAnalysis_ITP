		<content> In the early days of World War II     
 Alsager was transformed from a sleepy 
 country village into a war base       
 throbbing with noisy evacuee children 
 from Liverpool. In 1940 the urgent    
 need for munitions saw the            
 establishment of the thirteenth Royal 
{Ordinance factory}at{Radway Green}in  
 the south west corner of the parish.  
 The factory continues to operate and  
 some days the noise of distant firing 
 can be heard as testing is carried    
 out. Local residents appear not to    
 notice it anymore and pay little      
 attention even when large explosions  
 occur. Munition workers flooded into  
 Alsager during the war period and     
 urgently needed accommodation         
 constructed for them continues to be a
 housing estate. Nowadays workers      
 travel to Radway Green from all parts 
 of Cheshire and Staffordshire.        </content>
