		<content>        {HISTORY OF WESTBURY           
  Westbury is a Saxon name meaning west
 fort which was sited on a low mound   
 lying to the north of the present     
 church.2\kms.SW lie the ditch and bank
 of Beaumont Castle, a similar site.   
 Arnold Cilt held in 1086 a manor of   
 2\ hides (roughly 300 acres),land     
 enough for 7 ploughs with 2 more on   
 the demesne.In addition 8 villeins    
 and 5 bordars had 5 ploughs.250 swine 
 fed in the surrounding woodland.      
 Altogether it was worth 3 pounds.The  
 saxon Cilt,thegn of Edward the        
 Confessor, had lost the land at the   
 time of the Conquest so that by 1086  
 it was Roger de Ivery who held the    
 land of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and half
 brother of William. Although the      
 manorial rights changed hands many    
 times over the years, Westbury        
 remained a manor until 1931.          </content>
