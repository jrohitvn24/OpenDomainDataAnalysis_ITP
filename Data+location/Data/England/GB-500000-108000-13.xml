		<title>13A VIEW ACROSS THE ARUN GAP</title>
		<content> A pleasant scene greets the eye of the
 beholder as he stands near North Stoke
 Church looking West. Coniferous woods 
 crown the higher slopes of Arundel    
 Park which fall steeply down to the   
 river Arun.  Deciduous woods edge the 
 long curve of the river.  In the Park 
 stretches of turf are interspersed    
 with  small patches of cultivation    
 grown as cover for pheasants, and a   
 pleasant path follows the course of   
 the river.  Occasional glimpses can be
 had of old chalk pits. On the east of 
 the river the flat meadows of the     
 valley provide grazing for cattle, and
 the Georgian farmhouse and            
 outbuildings cluster on higher ground 
 near the church.  The road from       
 Houghton Bridge peters out here for   
 this is a cul-de-sac village.
