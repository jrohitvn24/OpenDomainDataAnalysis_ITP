		<title>18BUS SERVICES, THWAITES</title>
		<content> There are very few bus services in    
 our area. Those there are go through  
 The Green and The Hill. There are bus 
 stops at The Green, The Hill and at   
 St.Anne's Church. Every day two buses 
 travel through The Green and The Hill 
 to Millom and three buses return.     
 Most of the buses travel from         
 Ulverston through to Millom. There are
 extra buses for school children. On   
 Saturdays and Sundays there are NO    
 buses in the area at all. Only 18% of 
 the families in our area said they    
 used the  services regularly. Those   
 who used the bus service used it for  
 shopping, going to school or college  
 or to work. Very few used it for      
 visiting. We wondered if more people  
 would use the bus if the times were   
 more convenient especially the 14% who
 do not own a car.
