		<content> The paper that I deliver is "The      
 Evening News And Star".It is delivered
 from Carlisle by van at approximately 
 3:30 pm.When I get home from school   
 the papers are on my doorstep.I take  
 them in and count them to see if they 
 have sent me the correct amount of    
 papers.I then put them in my paper    
 -bag and go out on my round.My round  
 consists of:_ Canny Croft, Macadam Way
 Drovers Lane, Penny Hill Park,        
 Raislands Croft,Monnington Way and    
 Anchor Close.I deliever five nights a 
 week,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday
 and Saturday.I also have to collect   
 the money which is 16p per paper.Some 
 people pay daily but some people pay  
 weekly.The wage I get is about Â£4.50 a
 week and sometimes I get tips.
