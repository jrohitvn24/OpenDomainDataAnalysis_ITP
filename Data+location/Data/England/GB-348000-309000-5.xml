		<title>05PELICAN CROSSING</title>
		<content> By{Coleham School}there is a new      
 pelican crossing. We questioned people
 about it. Most people we stopped gave 
 favourable comments about it. Some    
 people thought it was a great idea and
 said it was long over due. Others     
 thought it was in a stupid place      
 being on a bend and should have been  
 built farther along. We had all sorts 
 of comments from it being a time      
 waster to it not giving you time to   
 cross. Most said it helps young and   
 old to cross and agreed it was        
 better now we had one. We watched     
 people crossing the road and nearly   
 half did not bother using the pelican 
 crossing. We thought this was because 
 people had to wait too long after a   
 car had gone through before it would  
 change back. We believe the lights    
 sequence should be speeded up so that 
 more people would use it more often.  </content>
