		<title>04Michael - a 6 yr. old's day.</title>
		<content> I get up at quarter to eight, get     
 dressed and have branflakes and coffee
 for my breakfast. The school uniform  
 consists of grey pants, white shirt   
 and a blue and yellow tie. My dad     
 drives me to school in the car which  
 takes about ten minutes.              
 When we get to school we play until   
 9 o'clock. In school we do number work
 which is adding and finding the       
 difference. In the morning we do      
 religion and numberwork.              
 From 10.40 till 10.55 we play in the  
 playground. I like to play Super      
 Man.  I also do sound work and        
 storytime. At 12 o'clock we go and    
 play till 12.20 and then have our     
 dinner. We have another play at 2.30  
 till 2.45. After 'choice time' we go  
 home. At home after tea I watch       
 'Streethawk'. Then I go to bed at     
 8.30.                                 </content>
