		<content>{ALL SAINTS CHURCH - DUNTON BASSETT    
 The first church was built in the     
 13th century. Lady Geve Ridel gave the
 church and land to the Benedictine    
 Monks at Sutton Coldfield. There are 3
 stone carved heads of Lady Ridel      
 inside the church. The Visitors' Book 
 dates from 1931. The furthest visitor 
 came from Arisona, USA. The 14th      
 century bench seats are recorded in   
 Coxs' "English Church Furniture". The 
 font is 15th century, together with   
 the oak roof. Currently there is much 
 restoration needed to the floor, spire
 and organ, costing more than Â£27,000. 
 The memorials inside the church are   
 for vicars, except for Thomas         
 Stokes, J.P. 1784-1867, who gave the  
 land for the school in 1848. In the   
 graveyard the oldest stone was for    
 John Phillips who died in 1754.
