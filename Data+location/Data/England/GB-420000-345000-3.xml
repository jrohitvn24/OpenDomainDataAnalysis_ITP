		<content>{Bradley Wood}is off{Belper}Road.At the
 west end of the wood all the trees are
 deciduous,they are mainly silver birch
 and oak.The soil is sandy.Up the west 
 hill going to the{airfield}the trees  
 are old and just oak trees are        
 covering the hill.A little further up 
 are some coniferous trees bearing     
 cones.The{airfield}is now disused.    
 Part of it is used for growing crops. 
 The runway is still there and beside  
 it there is muddy ground.The east end 
 of the wood is mainly fir trees.The   
 bracken is about five feet tall and   
 the bracken from last year slowly rots
 away.Eventually you can turn left     
 running parallel to the road where oak
 trees take over again and the bracken 
 comes back.                           
   There are lots of rabbits,squirrels 
 ,foxes and birds in the wood.
