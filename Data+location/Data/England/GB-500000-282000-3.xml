   The chancel was recased early in the
 eighteenth century and the tower      
 restored at the same time. In 1901    
 there was extensive restoration of the
 fabric when the floors of the nave and
 aisles were lowered to their original 
 level and the tower underpinned to a  
 solid foundation. The roof beams are  
 all modern. The church is also        
 interesting because it has some       
 plaques in memory of some well-known  
 admirals.                             
   Another interesting feature of the  
 church is that it is on a hill outside
 the village overlooking the Nene. From
 the churchyard, kept down by sheep&lt;!> 
 you can also see the churches at      
 Achurch,Clopton and Achurch. The      
 villagers want to improve the         
 parish-hall and recently held a big   
 fund-raising event.                   </content>
