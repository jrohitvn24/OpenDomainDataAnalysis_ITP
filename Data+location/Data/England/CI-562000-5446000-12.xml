		<content>   The Jersey Museum in Pier Road, St. 
 Helier is owned by the Societe        
 Jersiaise, the local learned society, 
 which has its library and member's    
 room in part of the building. The     
 Jersey Heritage Trust, recently formed
 to co-ordinate the various museum and 
 art resources of the island, also has 
 its office there. The actual museum,  
 open to the public 6 days a week,     
 houses many different exhibits, from  
 a whale to coins, a Jersey kitchen    
 to a pharmacy, reminders of Lillie    
 Langtry to relics of the German       
 Occupation enthusiastically loaned by 
 islanders for a lively display opened 
 in 1985 to commemorate the 40th       
 anniversary of the Liberation. Future 
 plans include the construction of a   
 new building and redevelopment of the 
 old to enable visitors to enjoy actual
 participation in the expositions.     </content>
