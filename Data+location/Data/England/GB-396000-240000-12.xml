 The villages of Elmley Castle and     
 Little Comberton stand on the original
 Saxon sites.The church ruins became   
 the foundations for the Norman        
 churches.Following the feudal wars of 
 1135-1153 the castle at Elmley grew in
 importance.The deer park was enclosed 
 and the village prospered.By 1298 the 
 castle had fallen into disrepair and  
 finally became a quarry;the stone used
 locally for churches,houses,walls and 
 bridges.The Middle Ages saw           
 development of sheep farming and corn 
 growing.In 1575 Queen Elizabeth I     
 visited Elmley Castle.By the mid      
 eighteenth century there were farm    
 orchards for the consumption of fresh 
 fruit and cider production,market     
 gardening had increased.The orchards  
 have now disappeared with an increase 
 in corn production.                   </content>
