		<title>12RECTOR OF GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content> He has been here for 12 years.He is   
 always on call &amp; so his privacy is    
 limited as his office is in his       
 house.He has about 4 baptisms, 5      
 weddings &amp; 10 funerals a year with    
 one-tenth of the population attending 
 church on Sundays.More go at Easter,  
 Harvest &amp; Christmas.He teaches at our 
 school because he thinks it is        
 important to know the children &amp; for  
 them to meet their Rector.Our school  
 is not a church school but we think   
 this is important too.He thinks that  
 the elderly &amp; housebound need the most
 help.His favourite hymn is "Praise to 
 the Holiest in the Height" &amp; his      
 favourite prayer is St.Richard's of   
 Chichester.Fulnny things often happen,
 for instance the organist once stopped
 with another verse to sing.  Mr. Grant
 thinks the church is important as it  
 is the village centre.                </content>
