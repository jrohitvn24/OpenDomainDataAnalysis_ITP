		<title>08PLUMTREE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE</title>
		<content>      The Telephone Exchange serves    
 5 villages,Plumtree,Tollerton,Keyworth
 Stanton on the Wolds and Normanton.The
 Exchange was built in 1958 and is next
 to Plumtree School.There are 4600     
 telephones connected there.Because    
 each telephone needs 2 wires.There are
 9200 wires going into the building.   
 Each call is timed on a meter and     
 photographed.The numbers on the meter 
 are used to work out the bill.        
      In about 2 years the Exchange    
 will be totally modernized.All the    
 testers,meters and 4 point setters    
 will be replaced by micro chips.      
      The Exchange is run by 1 person, 
 Mr White.To make it safer for him the 
 Exchange runs on 50 volts.If there is 
 a power cut a generater is            
 automatcally swiched on.If that fails 
 there are batteries which could keep  
 up the power for 24 hours.            </content>
