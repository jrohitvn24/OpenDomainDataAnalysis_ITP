		<content>{BRITAIN IN BLOOM COMPETITION          
 Marlborough entered this for the first
 time this year and we are hopeful of  
 winning a commendation.  We have      
 started a similar 'Marlborough in     
 Bloom' competition.                   
                                       
                                       
{VISIT TO GUNJUR                       
 The mayor will lead a party of 12     
 school children (4 from the College   
 and 8 from St. John's comprehensive)  
 to Gunjur, in the Gambia: a village   
 that desperately needs our help in    
 building a new classroom block.  The  
 money has been raised and the block   
 will be built in what should be an    
 exciting expedition. Next year it is  
 hoped that people from Gunjur will    
 visit to build a children's           
 playground.
