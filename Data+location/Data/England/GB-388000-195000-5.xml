		<title>05FARMING:MACHINES &amp; BUILDINGS</title>
		<content> Most of the farming land is devoted to
 the growing of crops, particularly    
 cereals such as wheat and barley. So {
{FARM MACHINERY}is used mainly for     
 cultivation: ploughs, harrows,rotary  
 cultivators, combine havesters and    
 seed drills. There are only about 10  
 farms in the block, so these tend to  
 be quite large up to 1000 acres, so   
 farm{BUILDINGS}are well spaced out    
 with the occasional old barn, perhaps 
 derelict, breaking up the otherwise   
 monotonous{LANDSCAPE.}On the smaller  
 farming units expensive machinery is  
 sometimes shared. One farmer with 630 
 acres of mainly arable farmland       
 reported that the land was of good    
 quality and that like many other      
 farmers it had been handed down to him
 from one generation to another. With  
 only 3 employed to help him, the farms
 are not a great consumer of labour.   </content>
