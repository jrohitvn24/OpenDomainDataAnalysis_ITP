		<title>04LIFE STYLE IN CHURCH STREET</title>
		<content> The life style of the people living in
{Church Street}has several aspects.    
 Some of the inhabitants of this       
 peaceful part of North Kent commute to
 towns for employment whilst others are
 employed on local farms. They need to 
 travel only two kilometres south, to  
 the village of Higham, to attend      
 Junior School, join in varied village 
 activities,including Age              
 Concern,Mothers and Toddlers Club,    
 shopping etc. Conversely,if they      
 proceed in a northerly direction,     
 towards the{River Thames},they can    
 enjoy walking and sailing. They are   
 proud that their hamlet has been in   
 existence for over one thousand years.
 An entry in the original{Domesday Book
 established the presence of a church  
 here. The houses are varied; some     
 thatched but the majority are         
 modern,brick-built houses.            </content>
