{Down,Westerleigh and Kendleshire.     
   Cut in half by the{M4}running east  
 to north-west of the area, it is      
 largely dormitory suburb in the       
 west and agricultural land in the     
 east. {The 'DOWNS'}end here with      
 pretty hilly countryside near Moorend 
 and Bury Hill, and flatter fields _   
 some low lying to the east near the   
 Folly Brook.

{Frenchay}corner and the{Fromeside     
{Walkway}twists north through to       
{Winterbourne.

   Property varies from council house  
 estates to very expensive country     
 houses.                               </content>
