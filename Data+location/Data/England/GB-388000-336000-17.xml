		<title>17OULTON HEATH</title>
		<content>   Oulton Heath has a well maintained  
 tarmaced road with no pavements. On   
 the right of this road (from Stone) it
 is enclosed rough grazing land, with a
 right of way through to the vilage of 
 Oulton.There is an underground        
 resevoir on this side.                
  A few detached old country cottages, 
 snow cemmed and renovated, but one at 
 least (Golf Cottage) goes back to the 
 early seventeenth century.            
  On the other side of the road, almost
 opposite the right of way into Oulton 
 village, is another right of way, at  
 the left of Midfield Nurseries,       
 through several fields out at Ford    
 farm and to the Wash Dale Road.       
  On the right is the Downsbanks. The  
 Downsbanks stream crosses this road   
 and over the stream is a wooden       
 footbridge with railings.
