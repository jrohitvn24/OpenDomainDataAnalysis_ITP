		<title>03A LOCAL INDUSTRY IN WOOTTON</title>
		<content>  The{Olney Canvas and PVC works}is    
 situated in a two storey converted    
 garage along{Red Road in Wootton.     
 About 85% of the goods that made are  
 for physiotherapy and nursing aids.   
 The rest are used for such uses as    
 uphholstery in boats. The goods go to 
 hospitals or to distributors but the  
 factory does not deal directly with   
 overseas countries.                   
  The Olneys have owned the factory    
 for 5 years and have 4 full time and  
 a few part-time workers. They start   
 work at 9 a.m. The workers are local  
 people, as are the owners. Apart from 
 the male owner and the son of the     
 owners all the workers are female.    
  The factory produces goods on a small
 scale and does not employ mass        
 production.
