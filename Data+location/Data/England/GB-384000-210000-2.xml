 grassland, situated one and a quarter 
 miles north of the village, and lying 
 929 feet above sea level.             
    The Beacon was the site of Kimsbury
 Iron Age hill-fort and was defended by
 a set of ditches on the south, east   
 and west sides, forming a triangle,   
 and covering seven acres.The original 
 site has been damaged by a golf course
 and some old disused quarries. The    
 golf course has eighteen holes,with   
 both course and clubhouse running next
 to a wood.The old quarries are mainly 
 slate.There is a stone on the top of  
 the Beacon which is a triangulation or
 mapping point.                        
    In 1977, the Beacon was used to

 II.Today it is mainly a recreational  
 area, where people go to play golf, or</content>
