		<title>09HEVERSHAM SPORTS DAY (cont.)</title>
		<content> After tea we had a wheelbarrow race   
 for boys and girls.                   
                                       
 The egg and spoon race was next.  They
 had a Borders Race and a Visiting     
 Children's Race.  The last event was  
 the fell race.  The infants have a    
 race round the field.  The juniors go 
 up to the Head and up to the first    
 telephone wire.  The intermediates go 
 up to the Head and to the fourth      
 telephone wire and back.  The juniors 
 go up to the top of the Head across   
 the Head and down.  It was a very     
 enjoyable day and good fun.  Al night 
 the parents had a dance.
