		<title>13THE LOCAL DOCTOR, AYSGARTH</title>
		<content> Our local doctor has been a General   
 Practitioner for 26 years. She has    
 worked in Aysgarth for 5 years. Her   
 area covers the villages of West      
 Burton, West Witton, Walden,          
 Bainbridge , Thoralby &amp; Bishopdale.   
 The doctor is in partnership with her 
 husband and they have about 2400      
 patients. They take 3 surgeries a day 
 and also go round to all those who    
 cannot come to the surgery. The most  
 common complaints are rheumatism,     
 arthritis, high blood pressure and    
 infections. The doctor thinks that    
 illness and treatment have changed    
 because people are living longer and  
 illnesses of old age are more         
 common.The disadvantage of this area  
 is the distance from the hospital and 
 the isolated position of some farms,  
 but one of the advantages is knowing  
 all the patients.                     </content>
