		<content>The block straddles the River Exe      
Estuary. At this point, the water is   
1.5 km wide and tidal. The western     
side is low lying flood plain, mainly  
flat park and meadow land, and         
includes the southern part of the      
Exeter canal which ends at the Turf    
Hotel. To the south is part of the     
Powderham Estate,home of the Earls     
of Devonshire. On the west, terraces   
rise to 50m and two villages are       
sited where tributaries join the Exe.  
Exton and Lympstone have both grown    
into commuter and retirement centres.  
The Royal Marine Training camp lies    
between the two.The area is scenically 
notable and provides leisure and       
recreational opportunities for the     
people of the nearby larger centres    
of Exeter and Exmouth.
