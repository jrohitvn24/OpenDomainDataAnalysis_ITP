		<content>   The Bluebell Railway runs from      
 Sheffield Park to Horstead-Keynes.It  
 is five miles long.The only station,in
 our block is Freshfield Halt. It      
 attracts most of its customers at     
 weekends.In a season it carries 250,  
 000 to 300,000 people.Most of the     
 people come from an area of 50 to 60  
 miles around Sheffield Park.The       
 railway has 32 engines but only 12 are
 working.The others are being restored.
 The railway appeared in many films eg 
 'Bullshot'and the sequel to the'Dirty 
 Dozen'.It is mostly used for          
 television and radio.Many famous      
 people have been to the railway apart 
 from filmstars like Lord Montagu,Lord 
 Stockton,Rev.W.Audrey,(author of      
 children's books) and the President   
 Johnny Morris.The railway has an      
 excellent safety record.
