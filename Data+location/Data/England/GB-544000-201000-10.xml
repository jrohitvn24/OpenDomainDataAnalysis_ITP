		<title>10FARMING AROUND EPPING</title>
		<content> There are no cows at Epping Bury now  
 as the{E.E.C.}gives more money to     
{cereal}growers.Healthy eating in 1985 
 means cutting down on animal fat and  
 sugar.Oilseed rape provides vegetable 
 oil so it is a very popular crop.It is
 also of benefit to the farmer because 
 it is sown and harvested between the  
 cereal harvest, so spreading the work 
 load.                                 
 What Mr Hunt enjoys best about being a
 farmer is working and living in the   
 countryside, but the worst thing is   
 working in all weathers like snow and 
 rain.{Farmers do not change,}but      
 farming in Epping has. Milk tankers   
 from the West Country can provide     
 London with milk today: years ago     
 dairy farming in Epping was a vital   
 provider of dairy produce to London's 
 residents.
