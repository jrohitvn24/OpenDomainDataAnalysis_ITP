		<title>14A Knockholt Character</title>
		<content> Knockholt Village is proud to have as 
 one of its residents Miss Winifred    
 Constable who is a direct descendant  
 of John Constable the famous English  
 artist. She was born and has lived all
 her life at Stoneings Farm on the top 
 of the Downs. There has been a        
 dwelling on the site since Roman      
 Times. Brampton Manor stood there in  
 the middle ages until completely      
 destroyed by fire in the 18th century 
 when Stoneings Farm was built. It is  
 known that Constable's contemporary,  
 Turner, visited and sketched in       
 Knockholt thus giving this village    
 connections with two of Britain's     
 greatest artists.                     
 Miss Constable is well known and loved
 in the village for her many activities
 and extensive knowledge of the        
 district and its history. She sang in 
 the church choir for many years.      </content>
