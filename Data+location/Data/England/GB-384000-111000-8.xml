		<content>{ BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR}THE      
 POPULATION WAS ABOUT 200 AND ALMOST   
 ALL OF THEM WORKED IN THE VILLAGE ON  
 THE FARMS. A FARM NOW EMPLOYING 3 USED
 TO NEED 32. PEOPLE RARELY WENT OUT OF 
 THE VILLAGE AS THERE WERE SHOPS IN    
 SHROTON PROVIDING ALL THEY NEEDED.    
 CORN WAS GROUND IN ONE OF THE 2 MILLS 
 AND MADE INTO BREAD AT THE BAKERY.    
 THERE WAS ALSO A BUTCHERS, A COBBLERS,
 A SWEETSHOP AND EVEN A CLAYPIPE SHOP. 
 THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 3 CARS AND      
 OTHERWISE PEOPLE HAD TO WALK AND RIDE 
 ABOUT. THERE WAS A BLACKSMITH TO SHOE 
 THE HORSES. MOST OF THE CHILDREN      
 ATTENDED THE VILLAGE SCHOOL UNTIL THEY
 WERE 14. THEY THEN USUALLY FOUND JOBS 
 IN SHROTON, THE BOYS IN AGRICULTURE   
 AND THE GIRLS IN SERVICE IN ONE OF THE
 BIG HOUSES. THEY WERE USED TO MAKING  
 THEIR OWN ENTERTAINMENT.{SHROTON FAIR 
 IN SEPTEMBER WAS THE EVENT OF THE YEAR</content>
