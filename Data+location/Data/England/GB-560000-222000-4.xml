		<content> Most families in Dunmow have at least 
 one car,many have two cars.Most of our
 parents use their cars to drive to    
 work outside Dunmow.We visited Smith's
 Garage.They sell about 2,000 litres of
 petrol a week most of it 4 star.They  
  sell Leyland cars,the most popular   
 are metros and maestros.We did a      
 survey of the{traffic}through the High
 Street and we found that the majority 
 of vehicles were cars.Lorries and vans
 tend to use the bypass which was      
 completed in 1980.There are buses to  
 Colchester,Bishop's Stortford,Saffron 
 Walden and Chelmsford which call at   
 nearby villages.They run infrequently.
 The 314 bus to Stebbing only goes on  
 Thursday,the 33 to Saffron Walden goes
 every hour.There is a{commuter express
 coach to London which goes from the   
 Post Office 3 times a day.Some parents
 use this service to travel to{work.   </content>
