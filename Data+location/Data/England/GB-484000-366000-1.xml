		<title>01WHERE IS NORTH SCARLE?</title>
		<content>   Our village of North Scarle lies in 
 the West part ofthe county of Lincoln 
 Shire.We are very close to the border 
 between Lincoln Shire and Nottingham  
 Shire.Lincoln is our county town and  
 is our nearest city.North Scarle is   
 midway between the towns of Gains     
 borough in the North and Newark in the
 South.In North Scarle we are          
 surrounded by deep dykes which drain  
 the fields.Our nearest river is the   
 River Trent.The River Witham lies to  
 the South.Eleven miles North of Scarle
 is the Fosse Dyke which was dug by the
 Romans to join these two rivers.There 
 are many ponds and pools around our   
 village.They are now used for fishing 
 and sailing but they were dug to get  
 sand and gravel out of the ground.
