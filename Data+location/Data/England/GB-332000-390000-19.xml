		<title>19The River Mersey</title>
		<content>     The  River  Mersey  starts  at the
 Pennines  and goes past the  Pier Head
 into  the  Irish  Sea.  It  is  a fast
 flowing river  with  a strong current.
                                       
    {The ferry service operates between
{the  Pier Head,  Liverpool and landing
{stages at  Birkenhead  and Wallasey on
{the  Wirral. The ferry boats are named
{Mountwood,  Woodchurch and Overchurch,
{plus  Royal Iris  which is used mainly
{for  parties, discos  and  excursions.
{                                      
{   }Once  there were nine ferry  boats
 including  Wallasey, Marla, St Hilary,
 John  Farley  and  the  Royal Daffodil
 but the ferries are not used much  now
 because of the two tunnels.  The river
 is mainly used for  dredgers, tankers,
 container ships, fishing boats and the
 ferries  which  have  been  threatened
 with closure for many years.          </content>
