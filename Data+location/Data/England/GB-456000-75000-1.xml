		<title>01VENTNOR AND BONCHURCH.</title>
		<content> This block covers the extreme South   
 Eastern corner of the Isle of Wight.  
 It contains the town centre of Ventnor
 and the village of Bonchurch, which   
 was mentioned in the Domesday Book as 
 Bonacerce. Ventnor consisted of a     
 number of small cottages and an inn   
 until the early nineteenth century    
 when the publication of a medical     
 treatise suggested the climate was    
 good for pulmonary disorders.         
 Speculators moved in and most of the  
 buildings in this part of Ventnor date
 from around 1860. Ventnor is built on 
 a series of terraces and is dominated 
 by St. Boniface Down which rises to   
 nearly 800 feet and is the highest    
 point of the Island. Ventnor is now a 
 popular holiday resort but Bonchurch  
 remains unspoilt. The Landslip lies to
 the N.E. of Bonchurch.
