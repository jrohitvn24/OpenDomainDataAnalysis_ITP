		<content> The building of this part of Peterlee 
 began in the 1960's,with the majority 
 of the houses being owned by thr      
 Peterlee Development Coporation.Among 
 these are rented flats, maisonettes,  
 detached, semis and terraced houses.  
 The architect Victor Passmore was     
 employed to design these houses,      
 together around open grassed and treed
 areas to create a countryside         
 atmosphere.This idea was to get away  
 from the traditional rows of colliery 
 houses.Originally they were built with
 flat roofs.This proved to be a poor   
 design and millions of pounds are     
 being spent converting them to        
 conventional roofs.As well as building
 houses for rent P.D.C. has also       
 encouraged private firms to build in  
 Okerside Park.Individual plots of land
 were also sold to allow people to     
 build their own houses.               </content>
