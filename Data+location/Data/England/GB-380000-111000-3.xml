		<title>03SHILLINGSTONE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school was started by Canon       
 Dayman,Rector of Shillingstone        
 and formerly a Senior Proctor         
 of Oxford University,in 1855.At that  
 time it was one room(the present      
 hall).25 years later a second         
 classroom was addded for the          
 Infants.Few additions were made after 
 that until recently.In the last 10    
 years a kitchen, Staffroom,Junior room
 and corridors providing covered access
 to the toilets have been added.the    
 latest addition is the subject of the 
 following page.The school provides for
 children aged 4 to 11,after which they
 move to the High School at Sturminster
 Newton.It is a community school       
 involving all sections of the village 
 and receives a remarkable amount of   
 support from the community,both       
 financially and in other ways.
