		<title>20THE PROJECT</title>
		<content> We hope that you have enjoyed these   
 pages about life in our area.It proved
 to take much more time than we had    
 thought. We started by going out in   
 small groups with a parent, and       
 visiting the farms in the district.   
 With the help of the farmer we        
 completed a questionaire, and from the
 answers compiled all the pages on     
 farming. Then we split into twos or   
 threes to complete the rest of the    
 pages. We found it very enjoyable,    
 especially making and arranging the   
 visits, and writing the text into the 
 computer. We only got the computer at 
 the start of the project so using it  
 was an exciting new experience.
