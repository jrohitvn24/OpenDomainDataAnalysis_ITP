		<title>13John's Day, Newcastle</title>
		<content> John, 10, goes to school in{Jesmond,  
{Newcastle. }                          
    On Sundays, I usually wake up by   
 8.20, then read while I wait for the  
 papers to be delivered.  Later, after 
 breakfast, I get ready for church. I  
 go to St. Mary's Cathedral which has  
 beautifully coloured stained glass    
 windows. On returning home we all play
 croquet on my big lawn or I build Lego
 models. Then I practice the piano for 
 35 minutes.                           
    We usually have a traditional      
 Sunday lunch of roast, potatoes, and  
 vegetables from my Dad's greenhouse.  
 However, sometimes we picnic out in   
 the picturesque Northumbrian          
 countryside. After lunch I listen to  
 music,paint, draw or play games with  
 my brother.                           
    I find Sundays very restful after a
 week of hard work at school.          </content>
