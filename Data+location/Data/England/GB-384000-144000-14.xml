		<title>14THE NEW WARMINSTER LIBRARY</title>
		<content> The old town Library was too small to 
 cope with demand, so a new Library,   
 designed by County Council architect  
 John Hazel, was built in 1981-2 at a  
 cost of Â£630,000. It is sited in the  
 central car park and near Safeways    
 supermarket for ease of access. The   
 new library is well stocked with about
 44,000 books and 15,000 tapes, as well
 as periodicals, maps, slides and even 
 special tapes for the handicapped. It 
 has become much more popular than the 
 old building - there are now 13,300   
 library members. Busy local Librarian,
 Mr Michael Marshman, heading 11 full  
 and part-time staff, says running a   
 modern library is a complex job: it   
 requires several years training       
 including a specialist degree. Despite
 using computers and new technology, Mr
 Marshman thinks the future of the     
 Library Service still lies in books.  </content>
