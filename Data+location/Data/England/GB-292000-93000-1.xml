		<content> The 'D' block is situated on the      
 North Eastern outskirts  of{Exeter,}  
 the capital city of Devon.            
   The four northern squares are       
 rural and the other eight are mainly  
 residential suburbs. There are many   
 schools and lots of playing fields and
 open space. The district of{Whipton,} 
 most of{Polsloe}and part of{Pinhoe}   
 make up most of the residential area. 
 There is also a large housing estate  
 on{Beacon Heath.}                     
   There is an industrial and trading  
 estate to the east of the block and   
 the Exeter to Exmouth and Exeter to   
 London (Waterloo) lines to the        
 South.There is a great mixture of     
 housing made up of Victorian terraces,
 even older detached homes and modern  
 dwellings.The area is close to the    
 countryside and pleasant to live in.
