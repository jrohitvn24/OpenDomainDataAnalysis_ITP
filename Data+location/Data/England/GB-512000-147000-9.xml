		<content>     {Traffic}in Westcott is a big     
 problem. Pedestrians can take 5       
 minutes to cross the main road. During
 a 30 minute study 1422 vehicles passed
 through Westcott, including 2 bicycles
 18 motor bicycles, 8 coaches, 89      
 lorries and 1305 cars.{In a 30 mile   
{speed zone 67% of the cars were       
{exceeding the speed limit.            
     {During a 90 minute period 6 cars 
{were overtaking in the no overtaking  
{zone in Westcott.}A minor{accident    
 between two articulated lorries       
 demonstrated the need for a wider     
 road.                                 
      People travel to Westcott to go  
 shopping, 45% of these have trouble   
{parking}in Westcott.  The narrow      
 pavements along the main road are a   
 threat to all pedestrians.
