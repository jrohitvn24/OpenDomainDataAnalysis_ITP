		<content>{Rossendale General Hospital}is located
 on the outskirts of Haslingden. It is 
 a maternity hospital, but does not    
 have a casualty ward. Emergencies have
 to go to Bury General Hospital.       
                                       
 The hospital is located on high ground
 affording a magnificent view  of      
 Helmshore district. On higher ground  
 behind the hospital there is a disused
 quarry and reservoir. This has meant  
 that building developments have not   
 taken place,leaving the hospital with 
 its commanding viewpoints.            
                                       
 Doctors and dentists are to be found  
 in Haslingden town centre.These are   
 outside the Helmshore area.
