		<title>04LADYGROVE STUD,PRESTON</title>
		<content> Ladygrove Stud, in Preston,is one of  
 the finest thoroughbred breeding units
 in Europe.It occupies farm buildings  
 originally designed by Sir Edwin      
 Lutyens in 1904.These were completely 
 restored in 1976 when the stud was    
 established by the present owners.The 
 farm stands in prime pastureland.This,
 and the climate,produce ideal con_    
 ditions for breeding horses.The brood 
 mares are often flown to Ireland to be
 covered but return to Ladygrove to    
 foal.In the special foaling unit they 
 are kept under constant care.Out of   
 the 21 horses owned by the stud,some  
 are undergoing training at Newmarket  
 before being sold.The aim of the stud 
 is to improve the breeding quality and
 so achieve success on the racecourse.
