		<title>04Tidbury Green School</title>
		<content> Tidbury Green School was opened in    
 1931 with just two classrooms,a third 
 was added in 1937.At this time water  
 had to be carried from a water pump   
 which was in the centre of the        
 field.The"Canteen" (now school hall)  
 was added in 1949.The school was      
 originally heated by black coal       
 boilers in every room.In 1981 to 1982 
 the school was threatened with closure
 by the Education Committee because    
 of "falling numbers". The parents     
 fought strongly supported by the      
 governors to "save their school". They
 won and today numbers are increasing  
 due partly to 1981 Education Act,which
 allows children from "over the county 
 border" of Hereford and Worcestshire  
 to attend.This summer a new temporary 
 classroom is to be added due to the   
 financial support given by the parents
 to fund raising events.               </content>
