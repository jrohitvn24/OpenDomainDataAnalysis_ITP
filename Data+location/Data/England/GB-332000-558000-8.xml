		<title>08Drovers Rest Monkhill</title>
		<content>    The old Inn at Monkhill is called  
 the Drovers' Rest because over the    
 centuries cattle drovers from         
 Scotland, after crossing the rivers   
 Esk and Eden, rested there before     
 moving south to the Fair at Rosley.   
    The Fair was held twice a year when
 cattle were being taken south to be   
 sold or north in the spring to be     
 fattened.                             
    The Inn is over four hundred years 
 old and this year is in the 'Good Beer
 Guide'. The pub is cosy, being heated 
 by a coal fire; it has original oak   
 beams, provides bar meals and serves  
 'real ale'.                           
    This year a flat has been added in 
 the same style as the original        
 building.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
