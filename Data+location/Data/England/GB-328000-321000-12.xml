 St.John's Church.                     
     This was built in memory of       
 Richard Jones Croxon by his sisters   
 Frances,Alice and Elizabeth in 1878.  
 The vicar at the present time is the  
 Rev.Hodson.                           
     The church has a single bell and a
 very interesting font,made of a hard  
 grey stone with beautiful carvings on 
 the sides.The lid is made of oak with 
 wrought iron decorations.Inside the   
 church are many plaques such as :     
    "In loving memory of a husband,    
  William Greaves Walker who,for 19    
 years,was the rector of Knockin and he
 died on April 26th 1917.Also in memory
 of his son Edward William Walker who  
 fell on active service in Palestine on
 November 6th 1917."
