		<title>03TRAFFIC - A CHILDS VIEW</title>
		<content> A lot of traffic passes through       
Dartford everyday because it is between
London and the coast. Lowfield Street  
is one of the busiest streets because  
it runs right through the town. There  
are many accidents on Dartford's roads 
and some are fatal. There are plenty of
places for cars to park but not many   
petrol stations or garages. In the     
summer of 1985 road works are taking   
place where Watlng Street crosses over 
the A.2. They are widening the sliproad
to the Dartford Tunnel and             
strengthening the bridge. Also, down   
Princes Road, pipes are being laid.    
This is causing congestion in the town 
and roads around it.                   
 A one way traffic system is in        
operation in Dartford. This helps the  
traffic flow, but is often found       
confusing by new or casual users.
