		<content>The oldest house in the village is one 
called The Old Guild Hall. It has three
storeys and was built about 400 years  
ago. The other old houses in the       
village are only 200 and 300 years old.
Most of the old houses have had a      
considerable amount more built on to   
them with more modern materials. For   
instance most of the old houses roofs  
have been replaced with tiles where    
they were thatched. There are some     
houses which are thatched because the  
owners prefer it in order to make it   
look prettier. When the older houses   
were built they were thatched because  
tiles were too expensive. In fact      
only rich people could afford them.    
There are two housing estates in       
Gislingham, one of bungalows and the   
other of one and two storey buildings. 
Both were built in the last 20 years.
