{                                      
   At our school,we have a{swimming    
{pool.}It was built and paid for by    
 local people but was later given to   
 the County Council.The pool is{10m    
{long and about 1m deep.}We have{two   
{swimming lessons a week in school     
{time,}and the pool is also open three 
 afternoons after school and during the
 six_weeks' holiday.It is{not an indoor
{pool,}so we can only use it in the    
 summer months when the weather is     
 warm.                                 
                                       
   The pool has been open for ten years
 and the P.T.A.have just had to buy a  
 new liner because the old one had     
 split.They help by raising money to   
 keep the swimming pool heated and in  
 good repair.
