   {Eggar's Grammar School}was         
 founded by {John Eggar}in 1642. He was
 appalled  by the standard of education
 in the area, so he opened the school  
 mainly for his son's benefit.         
    There is a tale about the old      
 Eggar's.  One day the headmaster lost 
 his patience with a boy.  As          
 punishment he was locked in a small   
 room in the roof of old Eggar's.      
 Unfortunately the headmaster forgot   
 all about him and the boy starved to  
 death.                                
    Today the old Eggar's building is  
 still occasionally used by the        
 Alton Sixth Form College or for       
 Evening Classes.                      
    Modern Eggar's is a Comprehensive  
 school of about 900 pupils, in a new  
 purpose-built building situated quite 
 close to the old school.              </content>
