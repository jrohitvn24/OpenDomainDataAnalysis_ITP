		<content> The private schools also cater for 7  
 to 11 year olds and have boarding     
 facilities which serve a national and 
 international clientele. At the age of
 14, for the first time, a pupil can   
 choose 8 or 9 subjects which she or he
 wishes to study. These lead to GCE and
 CSE Exams. The resources available at 
 these schools are greater because of  
 the subject specialisation necessary. 
 From 16 years onwards Education is no 
 longer compulsory and is even more    
 subject based with a choice of 3 or 4 
 GCE 'A' levels to be taken over 2     
 years, or further 'O'levels in 1 year.
 Although the town has no University,  
 Technical College or Polytechnic,there
 are some Adult Education facilities at
 the Daniel Road centre, and the local 
 Libraries run an adult literacy scheme
 called Read and Write.
