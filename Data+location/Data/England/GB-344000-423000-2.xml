		<content>  Mr.Larry Cable owns a butcher's shop 
in Walmer Bridge. Mr.Cable has been a  
butcher for seventeen years.No other   
member of his family had been involved 
in the trade.                          
  Mr.Cable and his family live above   
their shop.The building is over a      
hundred years old. The shop opens      
at 8.30a.m. and closes at 6.00p.m.     
It is closed on Sundays.Mr.Cable has   
three people who come to work with him 
in the shop.The busiest period of the  
year is Christmas when long hours are  
worked to satisfy orders.              
  Mr.Cable's main competition is from  
the local supermarket but he has the   
advantage of all his meat being freshly
killed.His shop sells other products   
such as cheese and tinned goods. He    
plans to expand his business over the  
next few years. (Nicholas Cable)
