		<content>  Lots of children say they don't get  
 enough{pocket money,}even ones who get
 2 or 3 pounds a week. Some don't get  
 set pocket money but most children at 
 this age get about Â£1.                
  Children nowadays tend to like{school
 although there are quite a few        
 exceptions. The most disliked subjects
 are Maths and English, the most liked 
 are games and reading.                
  A large number of children think     
 that{TV}is boring because there aren't
 enough channels. Popular TV programmes
 are TJ Hooker, Fall Guy and Dukes of  
 Hazzard. One thing children really    
 dislike is{violence.}They think that  
 violence is mainly caused by people   
 out of work.                          
  Children's favourite{pastimes}are    
 watching TV and videos, playing       
 outside, going swimming and riding    
 bikes.                                </content>
