		<content>   Farming has gradually changed in the
 Halling and Snodland area. In Roman   
 times there may have been vineyards   
 in Holborough and Halling.Hops later  
 became an important crop.             
                                       
   More recently fields have been used 
 for crops such as barley, peas, rape- 
 seed, and potatoes.                   
                                       
   Near the river, the marshlands are  
 used to graze small herds of cattle.  
 The grassland is rich and green.      
 Some grass is cut for hay.            
                                       
   There has been woodcutting in and   
 around Halling for many hundreds of   
 years. At first the wood was used for 
 fuel and then for hop poles.Chestnut  
 woods are still harvested.In Upper    
 Halling there is a wood-yard          
 specialising in fencing.              </content>
