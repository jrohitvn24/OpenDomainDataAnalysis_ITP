		<title>14ADULT LITERACY IN MIDHURST</title>
		<content> The scale of the adult literacy       
 problem in Midhurst corresponds with  
 the national average and free,        
 confidential tuition is available to  
 those who require it.Tutors are unpaid
 volunteers who teach only 1 student at
 a time.They are specially trained and 
 can teach reading,spelling and basic  
 English.If a student wants to read a  
 motorcycle manual the tutor must learn
 about the topic.Lessons are once a    
 week and can be at the home of the    
 tutor or student or any other place of
 their choice.Whip Hill in Midhurst is 
 the local headquarters for the Adult  
 Literacy Scheme.They also teach       
 handicapped people who want to improve
 their literary skills.There is no set 
 course.It is up to the student to tell
 the tutor which of the literary skills
 he wishes to acquire or improve.
