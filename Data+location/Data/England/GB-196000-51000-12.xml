		<title>12Changing Times in Farming</title>
		<content> If you look at the farms in the       
 Lanjeth area today, they are very     
 different from a hundred years ago.   
 Each farm would have employed 2 or 3  
 men, probably with their families     
 living in the farm cottages. Many of  
 the men would stay at the same farm   
 for all of their working lives.       
 The farm cottage was small, with no   
 electricity or running water and      
 would probably have a thatched roof.  
 Most of the work in the fields was    
 done with horses until the turn of the
 century when steam power was used.    
 In 1985 the same amount of land is    
 farmed with fewer men using large     
 tractors and machinery. Many small    
 farms have joined together to form    
 large units with the farm house and   
 cottages being sold off. Intensive    
 systems can now produce more than     
 enough food for our country. (H. May) </content>
