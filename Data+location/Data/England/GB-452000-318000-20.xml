		<title>20MOORS FARM</title>
		<content>  Moors Farm is situated on the        
 Loughborough Moors and is a six acre  
 small-holding.This site was mentioned 
 in the Doomsday Book 900 years ago.The
 tenant has rented the property for    
 five years.                           
  Although the farm is very isolated,  
 the farmer and his wife like it       
 there.Their nearest neighbour lives   
 half a mile away and the nearest shop 
 is one mile away.They live very near  
 to a main railway line and the River  
 Soar.Unfortunately they have no record
 of when the house was built for a{    
{farming}family.                       
  The small-holder works a night shift 
 at the Gotham British Gypsum mine.The 
 small-holding consists of sheep,cows, 
 a goat and chickens.Machinery is      
 borrowed or rented,and people are only
 employed for hay making.
