		<content>   The South Notts Bus Company is a    
 private company in the village of     
 Gotham.The buses normally travel      
 between Nottingham and Loughborough.  
 They also provide a private hire      
 service and we always hire them when  
 we go on school visits.Every Thursday 
 a bus comes to take the children to   
 Clifton swimming baths.               
   Many of the staff have been there   
 for as many as forty years,and because
 it is a small company most of the     
 employees are able to do many other   
 jobs.                                 
   A few years back in 1972 Mr Dabell  
 was given the O.B.E for his service to
 the company and went with his son,    
 Arthur and sister,Peggy to receive    
 his award from the Queen.
