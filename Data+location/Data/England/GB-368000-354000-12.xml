		<title>12CREWE STATION</title>
		<content> JUNE/JULY 1985. Crewe station is      
 closed so that the track layout can be
 changed. The old layout of 17         
 platforms,285 points &amp; crossings and 3
 signal boxes belonged to the age of   
 steam when most trains had to change  
 engines at Crewe. This has not been   
 necessary since the introduction of   
 electric engines about 25 years ago.  
 Thus a layout which is cheaper and    
 easier to maintain is being installed.
    A new Signalling Control Centre    
 replaces the old signal boxes. New    
 lines are being laid to allow non-stop
 trains to pass through at 80mph       
 instead of 20-30mph. Stopping trains  
 will be able to approach at faster    
 speeds. Points &amp; crossings will be    
 reduced to 110. There will be fewer   
 platforms and improved passenger      
 facilities.
