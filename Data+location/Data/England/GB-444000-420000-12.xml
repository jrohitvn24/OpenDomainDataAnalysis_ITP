		<title>12Pedestrianisation.</title>
		<content>  This occured in the late 1970's &amp;    
 1980's.Earlier the town centre was    
 very congested.Previously trams ran in
 this area;with the influx of many cars
 the centre of the town became very    
 congested.The answer was to pave the  
 area and make roads to alleviate the  
 congestion.Jubilee Way and Stuart Road
 were made,these and Ropergate became  
 one way streets providing other routes
 for transport.The extension of open   
 market days came with                 
 pedestrianisation.Now we have a       
 Wednesday market as well as a Saturday
 market.On these particular days there 
 is an air of leisureliness compared to
 the chaos that once prevailed and now 
 a new shopping area has been created  
 in Salter Row.Time will judge the     
 planners of the 1970's &amp; 1980's,but   
 shopping can now be done with         
 a modicum of safety.                  </content>
