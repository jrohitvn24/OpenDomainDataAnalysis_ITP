		<content>  Colonel Round has lived in Birch for 
 68 years. He has also lived in Birch  
 Hall. Col.Round thinks the main change
 is{transport}in Birch. After the war  
 he said there was hardly any petrol   
 and villagers went by bike or walked. 
  When he was a boy most people either 
 worked for his father on the land or  
 Huttons the local builders because    
 they were the main employers. Now many
 people work in Colchester.            
  Col.Round owns Birch Estate which is 
 4000 acres approximately.  He hopes   
 that his family will carry it on and  
 will{farm}a great deal of it.  He also
 hopes they will go on planting trees  
 in the woods and other places. He     
 thinks changes will happen in the     
 gravel pits. When water collects there
 he hopes it will become useful for the
 public for fishing, wind surfing and  
 swimming.                             </content>
