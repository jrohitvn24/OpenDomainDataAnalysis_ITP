		<content> The most remarkable thing about Queen 
 Anne Cottage is that it has no mains  
 services at all.No mains gas, water,  
 electricity or sewerage.Lighting in   
 the cottage is by candle or oil_lamp. 
 A well supplies the water and a septic
 tank removes the sewerage.There is a  
 telephone connection with the outside 
 world.                                
 The next stop on our walk was         
 "Keeper's Cottage".This small home set
 deep in the wood looks rather like the
 gingerbread cottage from "Hansel and  
 Gretel".It was one of the gamekeeper's
 cottages on the edge of the Clevedon  
 Court estate.The present owner is a   
 lady in her 80's(the widow of a game_ 
 keeper).                              
 The last part of our walk took us to  
 Court Hill and the bridge over the M5.
