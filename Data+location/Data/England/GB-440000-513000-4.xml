		<title>04     THE GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content>    Every Tuesday night I go to Guides 
 at Butts Lane School. Usually we play 
 team games or have a game of rounders 
 outside. Some nights in the summer we 
 do treasure hunts around the village. 
 At Easter we have egg competitions and
 at Christmas a fancy dress party where
 we play bobbing the apples. Each      
 summer we go on a trip to Whitby by   
 train. Most years we have a barbecue. 
    This year we are celebrating the   
 75th anniversary of the founding of   
 the Guides. Princess Ann lit a torch  
 and it is being passed round all of   
 the Guide groups in England and they  
 are all lighting their anniversary    
 cakes and having celebrations.        
    As a Guide you can work for        
 different badges. I have received my  
 hostess badge and I wear it on my     
 uniform. Being a Guide is lots of fun 
 but we must remember the Guide Laws.  </content>
