		<title>08A Superstore.</title>
		<content>  Kwik-save is one of a chain of very  
cheap superstores, run to save as much 
money as possible.  It offers a limited
range of goods.  It is situated at the 
entrance to the Wildwood estate with   
its own large free car park.  You      
collect a trolley at the entrance.     
Goods for sale are displayed on shelves
,left in the boxes they came in.  The  
prices are on the shelves, not on the  
individual items.  Frozen food stored  
in chest freezers whose lids must be   
opened by the customer.  You select    
the items you want and put them in     
your trolley.  Then you go to a        
check-out.  The cash registers are     
basic adding machines and the cashiers 
transfer your goods from one trolley to
another.
