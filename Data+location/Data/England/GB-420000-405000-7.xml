 stone.  Many of them are terraced     
 cottages along the main village street
 and around Smithy Hill and Bank Lane  
 which was called {Ratten Row,}as they 
 used to make brushes in these         
 cottages.                             
 A lot ofthe cottages have{wells}in    
 their {cellars.                       
 Since l960 many new houses have been  
 built; two private estates and a      
 council estate.  Some of the modern   
 houses are built out of brick although
 many are also built of stone.
