		<content>{   SHELLOW CROSS FARM}is a mushroom   
 farm. The owners used to have turkeys 
 on the farm which were sold at        
 christmas, now they have just         
 mushrooms and some crops.             
                                       
    The house is about 285 years old   
 It is a reasonably big farm. They have
 380 acres of land in which to grow    
 their crops.                          
                                       
    They have 8 sheds for mushroom     
 growing. The mushrooms grow on beds   
 with peat in them. The beds are       
 stacked up on top of each other. 4 or 
 5 beds are put on top each other. When
 the mushrooms are cut all the boxes   
 with them in are taken to shops or    
 houses which have ordered them. There 
 are 4 sorts of mushrooms{OPENS, CUPS, 
{FLATS and BUTTONS.}
