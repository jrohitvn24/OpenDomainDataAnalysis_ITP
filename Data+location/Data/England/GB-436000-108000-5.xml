		<title>05Falklands Memorial,Marchwood</title>
		<content> The construction of the memorial      
 started on the 19th March 1984.It is  
 in memory of {the Falklands Conflict }
 during which the Marchwood based ship 
 RFA Sir Galahad was sunk, and the RFA 
 Sir Tristram was badly damaged.It was 
 suggested that a permanent reminder of
 the link between the Royal Fleet      
 Auxiliary and Marchwood would be      
 fitting.So a memorial garden was laid 
 out near the church and dedicated to  
 those members of the RFA who were lost
 during the war.The service was        
 attended by many of those who served  
 in local ships during the campaign and
 some families of those who died.Part  
 of the memorial is made from carved   
 rock that was brought from the        
 Falkland Islands.This was the first   
 permanent memorial to be dedicated to 
 the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in its      
 entire 73 years of existence.         </content>
