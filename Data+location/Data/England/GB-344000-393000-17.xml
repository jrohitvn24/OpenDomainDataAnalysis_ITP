		<content>   July 13th  the annual{barn dance and
{barbecue}of the{St. Julie's,Eccleston 
{P.T.A.}takes place.It is held  on the 
 upper floor of a large barn in{Clay   
{Lane Farm.}                           
   This farm dates back to{1690}and    
 originally this building would have   
 been used for drying out the grain.We 
 can still see the original ventilation
 holes in the wall. Nowadays it has    
 been whitewashed and a stage has been 
 added at one end for the band.        
   The visitors sit on some bales of   
 straw and upturned barrels and in one 
 corner can be seen some of the very   
 old farm equipment.                   
   The guests provide their own drink  
 and the barbecue food which is        
 provided by the committee is cooked   
 outside in the courtyard.             
   This event is{greatly enjoyed}by    
 many of the parents in this district. </content>
