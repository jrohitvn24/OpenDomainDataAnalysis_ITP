		<title>07Description of Haddenham</title>
		<content> We like living in Haddenham because   
 there are lots of things to do every  
 weekend. It is a{big village}and      
 people are friendly and always ready  
 to help. There are{lots of little     
{lanes and houses}both old and modern. 
 Some houses have been built on new    
 estates. Many older houses have       
 interesting histories.{There are lots 
{of places where you can walk.         
 Haddenham is unique in having so many 
{high walls and cottages made of       
{wychert,}The high walls surrounding   
 the gardens make the village feel cosy
 but there are{grassy open spaces and  
{duckponds too.                        
 There are lots of clubs and societies.
 Things go on every day so we don't get
 bored. There is a{good library and    
 Health{Centre, busy shops and several 
{factories.}It's easy to get to places 
 like{London}and{Oxford.               </content>
