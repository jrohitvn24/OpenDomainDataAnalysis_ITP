		<title>02The River Lavant</title>
		<content> The River Lavant starts at East Dean, 
 runs through Charlton,Singleton,West  
 Dean,Lavant,Fordwater and Chichester  
 and on to Dell Quay.The river dries up
 around July,and it starts to flow     
 again in November.The river flows     
 about 20 miles.The River Lavant used  
 to go around the Chichester city walls
 but no longer does so.We measured the 
 depth of the river by the sewage      
 station,and the depth was 18cm.Round  
 about June you see mallards and       
 moorhens hatch.You also see shell     
 ducks and Canada Geese,which are      
 usually found near Preston Farm,or Ox 
 Barn.Most of the fish you see are red 
 throats and sticklebacks,and also some
 Eels.There are newts which come up at 
 night for earthworms and other insects
 .There are also tadpoles,waterboatmen,
 pondskaters,water beetles,water-      
 shrimps,dragonflies &amp; water rats.     </content>
