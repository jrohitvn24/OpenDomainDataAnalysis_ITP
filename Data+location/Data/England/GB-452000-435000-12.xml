		<content>  The families living on the edge of   
 Church Fenton village have papers and 
 mail delivered daily and milk every   
 other day. There is a shop and a Post 
 Office half a mile away and a mobile  
 butcher,fishmonger and baker call     
 twice a week and a library once a     
 week. However most families have a car
 and travel to York,Leeds or Selby for 
 their main shopping. Many people grow 
 their own vegetables and have fruit   
 trees in their gardens.               
  The older generation are pleased to  
 have a daily visit from a warden paid 
 by the local authority. A             
 meals-on-wheels service is run twice  
 a week by volunteers with meals       
 provided by the canteen at British    
 Gypsum in Sherburn. The doctor holds a
 weekly surgery in the village for     
 those who can't travel to Sherburn.
