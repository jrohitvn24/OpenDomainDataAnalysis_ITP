		<content> 1189.It is unusual because during the 
 English Civil War,in 1648,a lot of    
 fighting went on and a cannon ball hit
 the top of the tower which made it    
 unsafe.So they built the top of it    
 temporarily with wood.The wooden tower
 is still there.There is a sixteenth   
 century hexagonal font made of lead   
 and wood.There are only 2 others like 
 it in England and Wales. {LITTLE TEY  
{CHURCH }also dates from{Norman}Times. 
 It is interesting because of its      
 apsidal end.Recently some medieval    
 wall paintings were discovered.They   
 are said to be some of the finest in  
 Essex.They are trying to raise fund to
 fully restore them. {MARKS TEY HALL}  
 used to be the Manor House of the     
 parish.It was mostly built in the 17th
 century but parts of it go back much  
 longer,at least as early as 1307. It  
 has a moat,and a priest hiding-hole.  </content>
