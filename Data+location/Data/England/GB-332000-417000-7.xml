		<title>07The Telephone Exchange</title>
		<content>  The Telephone Exchange is in         
 Hawesside                             
 Street and was built in 1974. Our     
 group was taken round by a man who    
 answered lots of our questions.       
 In the exchange there are 15 operators
 who are responsible for 16 000        
 telephone lines. The Southport        
 Exchange can handle 3840 calls at any 
 one time. We were taken into a room   
 where we saw all the clippers going at
 once. We were warned that you can get 
 an electric shock from a telephone. We
 went into the room where we saw ladies
 who were handling telephone calls.    
 The people who work there start at    
 8.00a.m. and finish at 4.45p.m. In the
 building they have a budgie called    
 Buzby. Buzby is the mascot that       
 advertises British Telecom.
