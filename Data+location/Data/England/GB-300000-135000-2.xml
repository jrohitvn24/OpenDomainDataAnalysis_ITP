		<content>      This area on the edge of the     
{Brendon Hills}is a very good example  
 of how the{population}has declined in 
 outlying country area during this     
 century.                              
     At one time the{Mining Industry   
{and Slate Quarries}could support a    
 thriving population.   It is a very   
 different story now.                  
    Apart from the fairly tight knit   
 community lying alongside the Mineral 
 Line, and occupying virtually the only
 land below 100 metres in height, the  
 population in this block is now       
{sparse and widely scattered.          
    There is now a great problem in    
 earning a living in this area.   There
 are virtually no services and access  
 is by three very narrow minor roads.  
 Many people now prefer to live in the 
 larger concentrations of population on
 lower ground.                         </content>
