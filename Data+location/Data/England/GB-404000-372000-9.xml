		<content> We are in Miss Pickering's class in   
 Fairfield Endowed Junior School and   
 we'd like to tell you about the       
 Fairfield area. Fairfield used to be a
 more important village than Buxton,   
 but now, in 1985, Fairfield is thought
 of as just a part of Buxton.          
  Most of Fairfield's industry is on   
 the new industrial estate. There      
 aren't many firms there as most of the
 land in Fairfield is either used for  
 housing or for farming. The farms     
 stock cows and sheep.                 
  The area is hilly, being part of the 
 Peak District and most of the rocks   
 are limestone and Millstone Grit.     
  There used to be a race course on    
 Fairfield Common, now it is the area  
 for a Golf Course. For recreation     
 there is also Fairfield Centre which  
 is on Victoria Park Road. You can find
 small shops near there too.           </content>
