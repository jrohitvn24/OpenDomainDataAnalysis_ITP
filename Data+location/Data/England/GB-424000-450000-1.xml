   The area being described is to the {
{South and East of Beckwithshaw,}which 
 itself is {South of Harrogate.}A very 
{rural area}with scattered farms and   
 cottages all of Yorkshire stone,      
 totalling around 45 dwellings in all, 
 some 20 of these being working farms. 
  {Crimple Beck}runs through the       
 centre,travelling{eastwards}through   
{Pannal,Follifoot and Spofforth.       
   Bordering on what was the old Forest
 of Knaresborough, the area is         
 undulating hills,{rising to some      
{230feet above sea level}at its highest
 point. The west of our area being     
 moorland with rain,mist,wind and      
 sunshime, ever changing, because of   
 its open aspect. At its{lower level it
{drops down 100feet}to the beck.       
   A very green area, with many trees  
 and beautiful long distance views.    </content>
