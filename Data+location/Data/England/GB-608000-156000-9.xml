		<title>09 Fruit Farming (1)</title>
		<content>Fruit farming is the dominant form of  
farming in the area.We visited a       
typical fruit farm, Arnolds Fruit      
Farms.The family has been farming this 
area since 1880.A typical yield in     
recent years is 3000 tons of apples,200
tons of pears and about 50 tons of     
strawberries,raspberries,blackberries  
and loganberries.The fruit is stored   
after harvesting in modern cold storage
units in which the atmosphere as well  
as the temperature is controlled.By    
controlling the oxygen,nitrogen and    
carbon dioxide, and the temperature, it
is possible to keep fruit edible for up
to 12 months.Each storage block can    
hold up to 54 tons of fruit.If you were
to be shut into such a cold store,you  
would die within minutes.It is a safety
rule that workers never enter a cold   
store on their own.
