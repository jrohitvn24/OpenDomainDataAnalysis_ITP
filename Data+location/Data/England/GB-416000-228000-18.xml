		<title>18SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Longborough Post Office is the focal  
 point for the area there being no     
 other shop for 3 miles.As well as     
 operating standard P.O.services it    
 tends to sell a little of everything. 
 The town of Moreton-in-Marsh is       
 undoubtedly the number one shopping   
 centre for the area in regard to food 
 shopping.On Tuesdays the centre of the
 town is covered by a large market     
 selling a host of commodities.The     
 market bus is a useful service for the
 local residents.For electrical items, 
 clothes &amp; furniture a questionnaire   
 revealed a complicated assembly of    
 preferences although Cheltenham,      
 Evesham, Stratford, Chipping Norton,  
 Cirencester &amp; Oxford were frequently  
 mentioned.Most questioned did their   
 shopping once a week &amp; used the post  
 office for emergency or forgotten     
 items.                                </content>
