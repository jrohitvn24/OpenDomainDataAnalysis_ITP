		<title>09LYME REGIS SEWAGE PROBLEM</title>
		<content> Raw sewage is discharged into the sea 
 at low-water from two ancient iron    
 pipes, one just west of the Cobb, the 
 other off the East beach. Raw sewage  
 is often washed up both here and at   
 Charmouth. The western pipe is        
 sometimes fractured by gale-driven    
 rocks; repair is not prompt, the      
 result is disgusting.                 
 Planners favour a treatment plant and 
 deep-sea outfall but persist in       
 choosing the most obtrusive           
 place, Cobb Gate, for this building.  
 Objections result in public enquiries,
 a Royal Commission, rejection and more
 delay.                                
 An amended plan to place the treatment
 plant further east, below the Marine  
 Theatre, is under protracted          
 consideration by the local authority  
 and the responsible body- The South   
 West Water Board.                     </content>
