		<title>12TRANSPORT IN GODMERSHAM</title>
		<content> Godmersham lies on the A28 road, from 
 Ashford to Canterbury. Traffic is     
 heavy with Lorries travelling to the  
 nearby motorways.                     
 BUS SERVICE is good with 13 services a
 day in one direction, the first at    
 7.08am and the last at 7.40pm. It is  
 poorly supported. The Post Bus carries
 post and passengers to outlying areas 
 twice a day.                          
 SCHOOL TRANSPORT is provided by       
 private coaches to Ashford for the    
 secondary children  and to Wye for the
 primary children. Children in outlying
 areas are collected by taxi and a     
 minibus transports the handicapped.   
 PRIVATE CARS are used by the majority 
 of residents.                         
 MOPEDS and BICYCLES are used by a     
 small percentage for shopping and     
 travel to work
