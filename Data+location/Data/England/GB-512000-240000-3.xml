		<content> The Southill Lower School uniform     
 consisted of a grey or white          
 shirt/blouse,grey trousers/skirt,a    
 grey jumper or cardigan and a two     
 toned blue striped tie.The school     
 uniform was not compulsary.           
 Occasionally the children at the      
 school would go on outings with their 
 teachers.An example of one of these   
 outings was a trip to the{'Stoke      
{Brewen Canal Museum.'}When asked if   
 they would like to see any changes in 
 the school the children replied "We   
 would like to see it repainted,it's   
 getting old."                         
 The eight to nine year olds also      
 enjoyed school,although they were not 
 as enthusiastic as the six to seven   
 year olds.
