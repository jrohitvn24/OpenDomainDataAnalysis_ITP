		<content> In the village there is a church      
 called St. Cassian's. The church is   
 used for a family service on Sunday   
 morning  and on Friday night for the  
 people who sing in the choir to       
 practice. There is a school called    
 Chaddesley Corbett Endowed First      
 School where I go.                    
 There is a market garden where        
 strawberries, raspberries and all     
 things like that are grown and it is  
 called Chaddesley Growers (Needham's).
 There is a cricket ground which is    
 called Twilight Cricket Club and there
 I have a good time. There is also a   
 local shop which sells sweets,        
 chocolate, ice lollies, things out of 
 the fridge and bread. The shop is     
 called Jukes Bakery Stores. There is a
 Butcher's shop and a Hairdressers.    
 There is also an antique shop, quite a
 few things in Chaddesley are old.     </content>
