		<title>01  Wootton  and  Hardingstone</title>
		<content>  Hardingstone is about a mile south of
Northampton on the edge of higher land 
which rises from the Nene valley.      
Wootton is another mile further south. 
Junction 15 of the M1 is only about two
miles away along a dual carriageway and
London is about sixty miles away.      
  There is not much employment in the  
villages which are largely residential 
and most people work in the            
Northampton or Milton Keynes areas.    
Simpson Barracks is between the two    
villages.                              
  The original village centres have    
been extended from, with a mixture of  
council and private housing.           
  It is a good place to live because   
there is a lot of countryside around   
and the facilities of the town are     
close at hand.
