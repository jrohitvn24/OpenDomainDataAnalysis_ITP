		<content> Our area is a rural one and the       
 inhabitants are anxious that its      
 character should not be altered.      
 However,in the past few years a series
 of new mine shafts have been sunk,    
 which together form Britain's newest  
 and most modern coal field. Residents 
 in Escrick were adamant that they did 
 not want the nearest shaft to be named
 after their village;it was therefore  
 named the North Selby Shaft.Farmers   
 anticipate problems with water flow   
 when extraction of coal begins in the 
 near future.The village is concerned  
 that new housing developments should  
 be kept to the East of the A19,and    
 that when planning permission is      
 granted for new houses,the quantity   
 and quality is appropriate to the     
 existing size and amenities of the    
 village.Hopefully,our area will never 
 be just an extension of York or Selby.</content>
