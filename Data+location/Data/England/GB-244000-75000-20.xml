		<title>20GREEN LANES IN LAMERTON-2</title>
		<content> Our green lane is no longer used as a 
 road.The farmer who owns the          
 surrounding land uses the lane with   
 his tractor,and sometimes drives his  
 animals along it to his fields.As well
 as this the lane is used by walkers   
 and as a bridle-path.We wondered if   
 this lane was part of an old road     
 leading to Tavistock,since it runs    
 parallel to the present road for part 
 of it's length.                       
 We have not found evidence of this,   
 but it seems likely.The farm machinery
 we found was of the horse drawn type  
 so this indicates that the lane has   
 been undisturbed for many years.
