		<content>   The oldest school in town is London 
 Road School. Its buildings are        
 Victorian and have started to         
 deteriorate with damp, rot and leaking
 rooves. They are now having a{new     
{school}built in the grounds of        
 Oakmeeds School.They will change their
 name when they open in September 1985.
   The housing around the town has     
 expanded and so the{newest school}is  
 Sheddingdean Infants School in the    
 north of the town.It has opened in a  
 spare room at Manor Field School while
 they put up the actual building.      
   All of the schools stand in their   
 own grounds. St.Wilfrid's and Southway
 have their own{swimming pools.}Most   
 schools have a good stock of{books,   
 and now have a variety of{computers   
 and software. Southway, St.Wilfrid's, 
 Manor Field, London Road, Oakmeeds and
 Birchwood Grove have BBC computers.   </content>
