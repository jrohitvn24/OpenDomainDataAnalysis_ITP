		<title>12  Leisure Time Interests</title>
		<content> People in Bruton have a variety of    
 leisure time interests.The activities 
 range from collecting novelty perfume 
 bottles to wine making.The most       
 popular hobbies seem to be gardening, 
 walking,reading and all types of      
 handicraft.                           
          In activities that require a 
 good deal of patience and practice    
 people usually start young.For        
 instance a local resident started     
 playing the piano when she was four   
 years old.Since then she has attempted
 recorder,organ,guitar,violin and      
 cornet.She learnt from this that it   
 was best to start at an early age and 
 practice regularly.                   
           Surprisingly some people    
 like home maintenance.One man enjoys  
 ringing bells,caravanning,board games 
 and table tennis.Some people find     
 pleasure in being with children.      </content>
