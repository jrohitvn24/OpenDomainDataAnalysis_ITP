		<content>     A lot of the industry in the local
 area is{manufacturing,}and virtually  
 all of this is in the "Manor Road  {  
{Industrial Estate }"  The industries  
 are classified as "light" and include 
 box making, car repairs, office       
 furniture manufacture, ice cream      
 manufacture, and aluminium component  
 manufacture.                          
 The condition of the factory units is 
 poor, and the whole estate appears to 
 be suffering due to the "clogged - up"
 nature of the sites.                  
 All{communications}with other         
 industries outside of the estate is by
 road - there being no rail link;      
 however links with{trunk routes}is    
 good, the A13, A129, A130, and the    
 arterial A127 route are all within    
 three kilometres of the factory sits. 
 About 35 companies exist on the       
 estate.                               </content>
