		<title>05TRADE IN LUDDENDEN</title>
		<content> LUDDENDEN is a small village in the   
 heart of the Pennine hills.Because it 
 is high up,it does not get many       
 visitors as travellers stick to the   
 main route passing along the valley   
 bottom.In the early nineteen hundreds 
 the village of Luddenden had lots of  
 shops.Today the shops have            
 disappeared.There is a small Post     
 Office that sells a few groceries as  
 well ,but these are expensive.Nearly  
 every family has a car and they go to 
 the larger towns to buy things.
