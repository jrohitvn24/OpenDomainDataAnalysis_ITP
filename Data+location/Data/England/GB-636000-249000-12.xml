		<title>12Health Service -Butley Area</title>
		<content>In this area there are no Doctors,     
Dentists or Hospitals, but there is a  
Sugery in Orford. The nearest Hospital 
Ipswich and the nearest Dentist is in  
Woodbridge. Most village Doctor's      
belong to an Emergency service and have
special First Aid kit and C.B. so that 
they can cope with disasters like coach
air crashes. If you are really ill and 
cannot go to the Surgery, then the     
Doctor comes to see you. When an old   
person needs to go to Hospital as an   
outpatient a Hospital car comes round. 
A mobile Chiropodist is available once 
a month. There is a Mother and Baby    
Clinic once a week and a Meals on      
Wheels service three times a week.     
There is also a Home Help Organisation.
                                       
School Doctors and Dentists visit the  
Schools with Mobile Surgeries.
