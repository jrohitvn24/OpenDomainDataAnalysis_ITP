		<title>03*** S.HETTON COLLIERY  ***</title>
		<content> The colliery was formed in 1831 with  
 the sinking of two shafts,the first   
 coal being 'won' in 1833. Production  
 boomed in the late nineteenth century 
 and the village expanded considerably 
 as a result.The peak of coal          
 production was reached in the early   
 1950's                                
       The recent contractions in the  
 coal industry have had their effect in
 the area and the colliery has slowly  
 been phased out of production, the    
 last coal being taken from the pit in 
 1982. The shaft and winding gear      
 remain operative as an emergency      
 entrance to the local workings and for
 safety work to take place.            
       Local miners have been moved to 
 jobs in other pits within the local   
 district.
