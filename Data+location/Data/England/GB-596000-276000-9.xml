		<title>09VILLAGE HALLS MK WESTON AREA</title>
		<content>Barningham &amp; Hopton have purpose built 
halls.Market Weston hall was formerly, 
a small village school of one room &amp; a 
kitchen.Each hall is overseen by a man-
agement committee.Hire charges pay for 
upkeep but major repairs are paid for  
by fund raisings.These halls play a big
role in village life as they are used  
for a great variety of events: ameteur 
dramatics,clubs for retired people,    
dances, Guides &amp; Brownies, Playschool, 
Toddler clubs, Parish Council meetings,
WI &amp; women's clubs, general &amp; local    
elections.Market Weston hall, being    
smaller, has more limited uses.Most    
villages in our rural area have their  
hall &amp; in many cases it forms a major  
meeting place for village events.
