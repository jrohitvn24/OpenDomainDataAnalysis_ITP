		<title>08Warslow Police Station</title>
		<content>     There are 5 people employed at    
Warslow Police Station - 4 constables  
and a female sergeant.   One           
constable lives in one of the two      
Police Houses next to the station.     
     The duties of the police are to   
protect the public and their property. 
The police in Warslow are called out   
mostly to attend road accidents.  With 
Warslow being a rural area the Police  
have to make sure that the local sheep 
are dipped correctly.  They also have a
duty to check that fire-arm licences   
are renewed properly.                  
     There is a Special Constable      
attached to the station, whose job is  
to help the regular police, mainly in  
directing traffic when it is busy.     
     The station has one police car,   
two vans, one landrover and a bicycle. 
The vehicles are replaced every 4 years
and do about 25,000 miles per year.    </content>
