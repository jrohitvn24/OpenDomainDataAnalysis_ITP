		<title>16BISHOP BURTON CHURCH/CHAPEL</title>
		<content> In the seventies a joint benefice with
 nearby Walkington was created; the    
 Vicar of{Bishop Burton Church of      
{England}being the Rector of           
 Walkington. The 8am and evening       
 services on Sunday alternate between  
 the villages, though there is a       
 regular 11am service each Sunday.     
 There has been no decline in the      
 congregation since the beginning of   
 the 20th century (12 at the morning   
 service and 16 at evensong),though    
 there is a shortage of 9-35 year olds.
{The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel,}built  
 in 1840, has undergone extensive      
 alterations in 1966, exchanging pews  
 for carpet and chairs.  Since 1966 the
 members have organised a Steam Organ  
 Service on the Village Green where    
 John Wesley preached 200 years ago.   
 This  attracts 300 people each year.  
 There are 23 in the congregation.     </content>
