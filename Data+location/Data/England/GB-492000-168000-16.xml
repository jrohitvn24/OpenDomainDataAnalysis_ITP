		<title>16ASCOT RAILWAY STATION</title>
		<content> The railway station is over 100 years 
 old. There are about 8 men employed   
 here and the Station Master is called 
 Mr. Chapman.                          
 There are 5 tracks but only 4 are used
 at this present time.The tracks are 4 
 foot 8 inches wide and carry direct   
 current to run the trains.            
 At the moment work is taking place to 
 modernise the station and will last   
 about 35 weeks.When this is complete  
 there will be a new kiosk,a small     
 canopy and a disabled toilet.         
 Trains leave this station for Reading,
 London and Guildford.                 
 During Royal Ascot Week about 40 to 50
 thousand people pass through. In a    
 normal week about 7 thousand people   
 use the station.
