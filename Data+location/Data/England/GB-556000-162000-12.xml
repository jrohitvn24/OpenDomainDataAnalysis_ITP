		<title>12Impact of the M20 motorway</title>
		<content> The{M20}motorway was designed to be   
 one of the two motorway links between 
{London and the Channel ports,}the{M2} 
 to{Dover}via{Canterbury}and the{M20}to
{Folkestone and Dover}via{Maidstone.   
 So far there are two parts of the M20 
 built, this one from{Swanley,}where it
 joins London's Orbital motorway (M25) 
 to just east of{Maidstone.            
                                       
 Since its opening and with a further  
 boost as each part of the M25 opens   
 the{M20}has{taken most}of the{A20     
{traffic.} This has had a{dramatic     
{effect}on businesses that rely on a   
{passing trade,}like{filling stations  
 and{cafes.} Several in{West Kingsdown 
 have{closed}down in recent years.  In 
 their place however, is{growing}a new 
 enterprise, the{small light industrial
{estate,}attracted by{easy access}to   
 the{motorway network}via the M20/M25. </content>
