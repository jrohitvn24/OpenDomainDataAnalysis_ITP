		<title>20WILDEN V.A. LOWER SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> Our school is in the middle of the    
 village by the pub and village green. 
 It's close to the church too. It has  
 one very old classroom, and one very  
 new. I started school when I was four 
 and a bit. I started to read books    
 when I was 5. My sister can too.I went
 into Mrs.Archer's class when I was    
 nearly 7. I like it in here very much 
 we do a lot of work. We've just       
 finished a Bird Project. It was great.
 We covered all the walls with         
 description and drawings and things.  
 We went to the RSPB at Sandy. It was  
 interesting there.                    
  I like swimming, music time,         
 acting, maths and history stories. I  
 like assembly to when we talk to God  
 and sing.                             
 I would like to be a boxer, a singer, 
 or a teacher when I grow up. I'm seven
 now. Goodbye! Love from Andrew.xxxx   </content>
