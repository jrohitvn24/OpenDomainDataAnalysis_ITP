		<content> The building looks like a church and  
 is about ten metres high. Inside it is
 very noisey where the machinery is. It
 is extremely clean.                   
 The building is high because the pump 
 used to be operated by steam. There is
 still a large pond which was used for 
 cooling. It is now full of tadpoles   
 and some fairly large fish.There are  
 also very pleasant grounds.           
 It pumps water from quite deep        
 underground and there is a stand-by   
 pump for emergencies. Most of the     
 water is sent to Cambridge. The plant 
 may soon close but if it does it may  
 need two stations to replace it       
 because of increasing demand for water
 in the area.                          
  It is the last manned pumping station
 in Cambridgeshire.
