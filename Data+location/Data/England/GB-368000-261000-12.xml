		<content> In our village we have got{four shops 
 although one of them is really a house
 where greengrocery is sold.The{general
{stores,}sometimes called the{top shop,
 is larger than the other shops and is 
 mostly self service. The stores sells 
{groceries, wines}and{spirits}and      
{household goods.}It also sells        
{newspapers}and opens every day,       
 including sunday mornings. The        
{butchers shop}is modern inside and    
 sells a good range of{meat.}There is a
 shop next door to the{butchers}but it 
 is empty The{post office}is very small
 and is like two shops in one. The post
 master has a section at the back and  
 the rest of the shop sells{groceries, 
{toys}and{odds}and{ends.}The           
{greengroceries}is at the back of a    
 house and the lady is very kind she   
 gives children scraps for their pets.
