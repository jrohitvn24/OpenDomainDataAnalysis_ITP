		<title>03Ryton Gravel Pits Lake</title>
		<content> Ryton Gravel pits lake is part of     
 the belt of sand and gravel south of  
 Bubbenhall of the Pleistocene period  
 of glacial outwash and commercially   
 very valuable.When excavations removed
 the sand,the gravel was found to be so
 saturated in water,that it could not  
 be lifted onto the processing belt,and
 so water pumps were brought in.The    
 result was a drastic alteration in the
 water table,effecting Mr.Smith at     
 Shrubs Lodge Farm.When workings       
 ceased,a steep sided lake 4-6m high   
 with various sized islands was formed,
 covering some 10 hectares. In 1977,it 
 formed part a Wetland Survey by       
 Warnact. Considerable birdlife was    
 observed and floristically interesting
 considering the poor sandy soil.A     
 small amount of landscaping has been  
 done,more is proposed,but too much    
 could endanger dragonfly habitit.     </content>
