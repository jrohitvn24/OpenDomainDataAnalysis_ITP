		<content>      Many families have close         
 connections with the local church.    
 The{Prince}family is one of them:Mr.  
 George Prince (Sarah's Grandpa)       
 has been a church warden for 30 years 
 and a bell ringer for 51 years.       
 He also works very hard in the church 
 and in the church yard.               
      Mrs.Prince(Sarahs Nanna) is the  
 verger and a sides man.               
      Sarah Watson(granddaughter)is in 
 the choir.                            
      The{Strickland-Constables }have  
 made a substantial contribution to the
 life of the church over the years.    
      Using the church's extensive     
 records,{Mr.N. Wright,}a former       
 headteacher at this school, has       
 written many historical pamphlets to  
 trace the development of religion,    
 family life, and education in the     
 area.                                 </content>
