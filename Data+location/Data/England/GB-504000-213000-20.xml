		<title>20THE FLAMSTEAD AREA</title>
		<content> Flamstead village is situated about 30
 miles north of London on a section of 
 the Chiltern Hills overlooking the old
 Roman Watling Street,the village being
 9 miles from Verulamium,now called    
 St.Albans.It is close to the M1,the   
 first major motorway in Britain.The   
 land use is mostly agricultural but   
 there is industry nearby at Luton(the 
 airport and Vauxhall Motors).Flamstead
 has its own church,chapel,public      
 houses,Post Office and shop.There is a
 village school and a private school in
 a park 2 miles from the village.The   
 area is of interest to tourists       
 through its nearness to London,Woburn,
 Verulamium,Whipsnade Zoo and various  
 historic sites.These days most working
 adults commute to the surrounding     
 towns and also to London.
