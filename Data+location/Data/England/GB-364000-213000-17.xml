		<title>17Being Unemployed</title>
		<content>{My Dad was made redundant from the Red
{and White Bus company.                
 He was'nt like he used to be, he was  
 hardly ever happy.                    
 He sat inside all day reading or      
 watching the television.My mum and Dad
 seemed to argue a lot which I hated.  
 We were low on money and my mum and   
 Dad smoked so they bought sweets      
 instead.                              
 My Dad used to go down to the Job     
 Centre nearly every day.At one time my
 Dad nearly had a job as a fruit       
 machine repairer but eventually he    
 went to Soudly Valley Coaches.It is   
 horrible when one of your parents is  
 unemployed but now he's happy again   
 because he got a job again.           
                                       
{In Cinderford there are a lot of      
{unemployed people.
