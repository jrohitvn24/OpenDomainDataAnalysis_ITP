 The pram race is an annual Easter     
 event to raise funds for the youth    
 club. 2 children decorate a pram and  
 races are run around St. Keverne, the 
 winner gets a prize.  The carnival is 
 held in July.  The queen wears a white
 dress and blue cape.  She has 2       
 attendants.  They all sit on a        
 decorated float.  There are classes   
 for other entrants.  The Ox roast (7th
 Aug.) begins at 8.30 a.m. when the ox 
 starts to cook in the square. The     
 first piece of ox is auctioned. The   
 gymkhana and donkey derby in the      
 Summer holidays involves pole bending,
 potato racing, jumping and fancy dress
 on horse back.  At Christmas carols   
 are sung in the square around a huge  
 illuminated tree.  Father Christmas   
 arrives with presents for the local   
 children.                             </content>
