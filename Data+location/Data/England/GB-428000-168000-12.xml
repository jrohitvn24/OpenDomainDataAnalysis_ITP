		<content> These fields are called this because  
 it is where some members of the       
 Roundhead army were drilled. At the   
 time of the Civil War, Littlecote was 
 owned by a{Colonel Popham}who was a   
 loyal supporter of the{Roundhead      
 cause.He equipped and paid for a      
 contingent of soldiers to be stationed
 at Littlecote, and they were trained  
 in these fields.                      
     The canal continues south, out of 
 our section, onto Crofton Top Lock,   
 the highest point of the whole canal.
