		<content>   In our survey we discovered that the
 vast majority of people in this area  
 who are entitled to smoke tobacco     
 (people over sixteen years of age) do 
 not. Many gave their reasons such as  
 the huge publicity which has been     
 around in recent years concerning the 
 terrible damage which the tar causes  
 to internal organs and the scare of   
 cancer.                               
   It has now become unfashionable to  
 smoke particularly among the young.   
   They now see it for the revolting   
 habit it is. No longer are modern     
 film stars seen with a cigarette      
 between their lips as Bogart used     
 to do.                                
   This is the reason that many        
 pensioners and older people smoke. It 
 is now no longer the 'in' thing to do.
