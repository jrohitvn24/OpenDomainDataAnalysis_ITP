		<content>Television is often blamed for its     
effect on society.Children are         
becoming less interested in reading    
because T.V. can supply sounds and     
pictures. Imaginations are becoming    
redundant. Almost every house has a TV 
many have   video recorders.Viewing    
time is shared  equally between BBC1   
and ITV.News is more graphically shown 
on TV.Newspaper readership is in       
decline.In our area, 23% do not read a 
daily paper and 31% go without one on  
Sunday.The most popular papers are the 
tabloids,such as the Sun and News Of   
The World .Local papers hold a steady  
circulation totalling 28,000 per week  
despite the popularity of two free     
papers. Local radio has become more    
popular recently,with two stations to  
choose from.People seem to read less   
nowadays despite the fact that they    
have much more leisure time.           </content>
