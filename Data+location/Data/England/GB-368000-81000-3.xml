 original Domesday Book as Sutone.     
  Sheltered by hills to the North,East 
 and West,blessed by a benign climate  
 and a perpetual water supply from     
 underground springs,there is ample    
 evidence that {Sutton Poyntz}has been 
 treasured as a residential area since 
 the Iron Age.Today's residents        
 represent accountancy,the army,atomic 
 energy,banking building               
 catering,chemists,dentistry,doctors,en
 gineers,hairdressing,the health       
 services,local                        
 authorities,manufacturers,the navy,the
 oil industry,pilots,printing,teachers 
 and other miscellaneous services.     
  The middle of the village is occupied
 by the village pond,which has been    
 dated as far back as 1780 and today   
 forms a delightful centrepiece.
