  Each week someone volunteers to hold 
  an Eastacombe coffee morning in their
  house, it is a time to meet new      
  people and to make new friends. It is
  also a good time to find out and to  
  discuss what is happening in the     
  hamlet. Eastacombe used to be a      
  little farming community, houses have
  been built around it as the years    
  have gone by. One of the houses in   
  the hamlet used to be a blacksmiths  
  house, and was probebly made of      
  cobble stones, but it has been       
  plastered over and has been          
  modernised, so now if you didn't     
  know, you would think it was recently
  built.
