		<title>14Tourism in Beaconsfield</title>
		<content>  By using several questionnaires we   
discovered that picturesque Old        
Beaconsfield attracts tourists from all
over the world. Its architecture is    
varied with timber-framed buildings,   
old cottages, uneven roof lines and the
beautiful parish church of St.Mary's,  
all very attractive features of        
England's rural charm. To cater for    
tourists and a large regional market,  
many antique shops, pubs., restaurants 
and two art galleries have sprung up.  
Other attractions include the workplace
of famous novelist, G.K.Chesterton and 
politician Edmund Burke. The New Town, 
home of many London commuters,         
developed around the railway (built in 
1906). Its one major tourist           
attraction is the model village called 
Bekonscot(1929). The busiest time of   
the year is the summer when the weather
is a little better for sightseeing.    </content>
