		<content> The two inns are the  Ferry  Boat  and
 the Bay  Horse.  The  latter, near the
 southern  end  of Ferry Lane claims to
 be the original  Ferry  Boat  Inn, the
 name having changed last  century when
 the present Ferry Boat  took  over the
 name. The original Ferry Boat has been
 the major judicial,commercial and soc-
 ial  centre  for  centuries.   Records
 exist for an auction of farms in 1791,
 for a  master  for a village school in
 1802 and for  Court  Leet  hearings in
 1827.A regular meeting place for vill-
 agers today, when, on any fine evening
 as many young people  gather  outside,
 as the older inside, in the 17th cent-
 tury cockfighting was a spectacle on  
 the same ground.The present Ferry Boat
 dismisses the flimsy evidence of name-
 change proudly  pointing  to  the main
 beam of the bar, a ships mast, as  in-
 dicating it is the original &amp; genuine.</content>
