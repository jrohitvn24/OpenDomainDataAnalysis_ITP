		<title>02NEWCOMERS TO BRACKNELL.</title>
		<content>  {Bracknell}was developed as a New    
 Town to take families from London.    
 People live in{NEIGHBOURHOODS}round   
 the town.  Crown Wood and Forest Park 
 are the two latest Neighbourhoods to  
 be built.                             
                                       
  {Crown Wood School}opened 2.5 years  
 ago, in January 1983.  At that time   
 there were only 49 children and now   
 there are 218.                        
                                       
   We are organised into vertically    
 grouped{Home Bases.} 'Vertical        
 grouping' means that there is more    
 than one age group in each Home Base. 
                                       
   In my Home Base there are 31 of us  
 and only one child has a parent who   
 was born in Bracknell.  Nineteen in   
 the Home Base moved to Bracknell after
 they were born.                       </content>
