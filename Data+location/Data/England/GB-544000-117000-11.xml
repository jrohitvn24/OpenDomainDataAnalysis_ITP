		<title>11Traffic Problems, Isfield</title>
		<content>   This quiet village is being used as 
 an{unofficial bypass}by people avoid- 
 ing traffic jams in Uckfield. When    
 Uckfield Bypass is completed only     
{10_20% less traffic}is expected. Most 
 cars travel fast even on the sharp    
 bends. Parts of the road do not have  
 footpaths;{children}and the{elderly   
 are particularly at risk.             
   The{Parish Council}have tried to get
 something done for the past six years.
 They have pushed for a 30 m.p.h.{Speed
{Limit}through the village but have met
 with little success. Other suggestions
 were to have double white lines &amp; 'Go 
 Slow' signs. Although the County Coun-
 cil will not allow these on their land
 residents have put up signs on their  
 own property. The Council have erected
 'Acute Diversion Chevrons' but it is  
 felt that there will be more{accidents
 before the cars are made to slow down.</content>
