		<title>18LANDSEER PARK,IPSWICH.</title>
		<content>  This large area of urban recreation, 
covers over 4 hectares  adjacent to    
the  large housing areas of            
South-East Ipswich.                    
  It is a good example of how wasteland
can be turned into something useful.   
Formally a council waste dump,it has   
been landscaped,grassed,and wooded to  
provide a pleasant area of countryside 
within the town of Ipswich.            
 Much of it,is for casual recreation,  
i.e walking over rolling grass slopes  
and through a small woodland.However   
organised recreation does exist,such   
as the BMX track(see page 17) and the  
adventure playground.                  
 One interesting feature is the        
presence  of ventilation pipes to      
allow methane to escape from the       
buried material deep in the ground.
