		<title>19A Day In The Life Of My Dad</title>
		<content>       A Day in the life of my Dad     
                                       
 My Dad sometimes works in the factory 
 or he goes out on a lorry.  He works  
 for Pershore Poultry Packers. The     
 ladies who work there pack the dead   
 chickens. He wears two sets of clothes
 because where he works there are big  
 freezers to keep the dead chickens    
 fresh.  His sport is football.  He    
 plays for Pershore United.  He goes   
 training every Wednesday night. His   
 hobbies are drawing and keeping fit.  
 He keeps fit by running and lifting   
 weights. In the evening he goes to the
 pub with his friend.  He goes to work 
 on his push bike sometimes at one     
 o'clock in the morning.  Our family   
 activity is going swimming. I         
 sometimes go with my Dad in the lorry 
 to South Wales.
