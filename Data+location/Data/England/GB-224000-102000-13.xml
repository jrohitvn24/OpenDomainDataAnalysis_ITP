		<title>13Farming C: Main Farming</title>
		<content>  In the majority of cases the main    
 farming industry in the locality is   
 the production of milk. The herd size 
 varies but is usually around the      
 hundred mark. The introduction by the 
 EEC recently of milk quotas has tended
 to result in a reduction of cattle    
 feed rather than of herd size.        
  Alongside the production of milk is  
 the rearing of dairy heifers and beef 
 stores which are sold at two years old
 for fattening.                        
  In some cases, hundreds of store     
 lambs are bought in the autumn to     
 fatten on the winter grass and are    
 sold early the following spring.      
  Besides dairy and beef cattle and    
 sheep the other main farming industry 
 is the growing of corn although this  
 is a very minor concern in this area.
