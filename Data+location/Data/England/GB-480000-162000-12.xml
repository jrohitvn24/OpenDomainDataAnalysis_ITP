		<content>    We interviewed people who have     
 lived in Sandhurst most of their lives
 to see what their childhoods were     
 like. First we interviewed Mr. Moth   
 who was born in 1910. He lived in     
 Little Sandhurst which was quite      
 separate from Sandhurst. There was no 
 piped water, electricity or           
 telephones. Lighting was from gas     
 lamps. Warmth and cooking came from   
 coal fires. Because he had no pocket  
 money he did a newspaper round for    
 which he earned 7 shillings a week    
 (35p). At Christmas he only received  
 fruits and nuts but never a banana. At
 school there were few books, instead  
 they wrote on slates. He was naughty  
 and burnt the headmaster's canes.     
 There were no school meals so he      
 brought bread, cheese and onion to    
 eat. In their spare time boys played  
 football or cricket, girls sewed.     </content>
