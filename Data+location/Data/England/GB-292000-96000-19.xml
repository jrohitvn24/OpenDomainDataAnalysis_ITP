		<title>19BRAMFORD SPEKE</title>
		<content>{ My name is Alison. The school I goto 
 is Bramford Speke primary school.There
 are 19 infants and 20 juniors.As you  
 come out of the main gate (by the     
 infants class room,which separate     
 from our classroom) there is a tree by
 our school.It was planted by Mr Stenor
 in 1964. It is a Quercus Rubra (red   
 oak).There are two roads one goes to  
 the left and one goes straight on. If 
 you take the one that goes straight on
 you come to a old mass chapel. It     
 still gets a big congregation each    
 week.It was built in 1894.There are   
 two semidetached cottages.The place   
 is called St End. Opposite there is a 
 big house which has enormous          
 grounds.The road is called Chapel     
 Road, because of the chapel.There are 
 two pumps by the cottages.Then there  
 is a lane that goes straight on and   
 out of Brampford Speke.               </content>
