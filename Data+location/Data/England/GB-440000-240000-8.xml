		<title>08Vandalism on Bretch Hill.</title>
		<content>Vandalism is the largest problem in the
Bretch Hill Area of Banbury. The most  
common forms are window smashing and   
graffiti. These are done mainly by     
children and teenagers between the age 
of 5 and 20. Sometimes children younger
than 5 years old are involved when they
are with older children. Recently one  
of the local schools had some windows  
broken, and the window sills written   
on with marker pen. It cost nearly     
three hundred pounds to put it right.  
Most of the Community Policemans time  
is taken up with visits to parents or  
people who have made complaints about  
children either playing football, and  
cricket in the street, riding m/cycles 
across the recreation ground or just   
generally being a nuisance. Friday and 
Saturday nights are the busiest when   
the older teenagers and those in their 
early twenties have been drinking.     </content>
