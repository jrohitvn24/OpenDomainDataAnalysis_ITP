		<title>10MULLION PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> We spoke to Mr.Buchanan, the Clerk to 
 Mullion Parish Council, about his work
 in the village. He is paid part-time  
 to organise parish council meetings,  
 and has other duties as well. He has  
 responsibility for street lighting,   
 for the cemetery and for building in  
 the village. At the moment there are  
 only 4 places left for burial in the  
 local cemetery, so that the field will
 have to be extended and the new ground
 consecrated. There are now more       
 cremations than burials which has     
 eased the problem, since the plot     
 required for a cremation is smaller   
 than that for a burial. Six new       
 factory units are to be built in the  
 village (In 1983,49 votes for,23      
 against).Everyone wants to ease the   
 high unemployment in the area, but the
 position of the units near the school 
 and shopping centre might be dangerous</content>
