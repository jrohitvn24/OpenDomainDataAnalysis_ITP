		<title>15TRAFFIC PROBLEMS-THE BYPASS</title>
		<content> Wadebridge is notorious for its       
 traffic congestion. Every summer there
 are queues of traffic waiting to get  
 into the town. It can take more than  
 an hour to travel less than a mile.   
 Two main roads{A39}and{A389}join at   
 the end of a narrow bridge.           
 For years a{bypass}has been proposed. 
 This would relieve the town of the    
{A39}traffic and improve it as a       
 shopping and business centre. During  
 the last 20 years most main road towns
 in Cornwall have been bypassed.       
 Delay is caused by the cost of        
 building a{second bridge}.The         
 estimated cost for the bypass is{Â£3.4m
 In 1983 the{Department of Transport}  
 published a proposed route to the     
 north of the town. A final decision   
 about the route and the starting date 
 have not yet been made in 1985.
