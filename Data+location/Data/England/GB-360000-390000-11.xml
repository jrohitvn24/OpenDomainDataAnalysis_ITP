		<content> Housing in the area is very mixed.    
 After Warrington was designated       
 a new town in the late sixties, many  
 new estates sprang up on the outskirts
 of the old Warrington Borough. These  
 estates include private owner_occupied
 and rented accommodation ranging from 
 single person flats, semi_detached    
 houses to luxury detached family      
 homes. Also included in this block are
 large areas of post_war council       
 houses, many of which have been       
 purchased by the tenants, small       
 private estates of houses formerly    
 belonging to the Admiralty, and an    
 estate built in 1978 by the Sutton    
 Housing Trust on land which formed    
 part of the site of the old Padgate   
 R.A.F. Camp which closed in 1957      
 after more than a million RAF recruits
 had done their basic training there.  
 The Camp is remembered with affection.</content>
