		<content> Very little farmhouse cider (scrumpy) 
 or perry now produced due to grubbing 
 up of orchards.There are still{damson 
 trees in roadside hedgerows,originally
 planted to provide fruit for the      
{dyeing industry.}In recent times many 
 hedgerows have been removed.Hedges are
 cut by various types of machinery.The 
 thorny debris causes puncture problems
 for motorists and cyclists,and is a   
 common topic in newspapers and pubs.  
 Hedgerows on Westhope still have{holly
 trees first planted to provide sheep  
 fodder and shelter during deep snow.  
{Oak,}the dominant type of tree, is    
 still important in the landscape.{Ash 
 and{field maple}are slowly filling the
 gaps created by Dutch Elm disease.Some
 local farmers &amp;{'Friends of Westhope'-
 a local conservation group,are engaged
 upon an active tree planting scheme.
