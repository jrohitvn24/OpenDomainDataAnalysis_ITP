		<title>14A Saturday on the Farm (2)</title>
		<content> but he comes in around four o'clock   
 for tea.After tea we get the cows in. 
 We stay to help by driving the cows in
 for about half an hour then we go     
 in.We sometimes watch a bit of        
 television and then if there is time  
 left before we have to go to bed we go
 to see what Dad is doing.If we can we 
 help him feed the cows by putting the 
 cake in the bucket and emptying it    
 into the trough.We have three cows    
 named Sharon,Rachael and Anne after us
 girls.They have all had calves and    
 these calves and cows are our         
 favourites.After the cows have been   
 milked we all help let the cows out   
 into the field.After that we go back  
 home except Dad because he stays      
 to check everything is alright.Then we
 go to bed.Sometimes we read before we 
 go to sleep but we are usually tired  
 by the time Saturday night comes.     </content>
