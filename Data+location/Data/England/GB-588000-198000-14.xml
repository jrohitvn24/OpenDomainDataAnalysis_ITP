		<content> I own 2 rabbits they are called Buffy 
 and Smudge.They are brothers and they 
 are about 1 year old.They both love   
 rabbit food and bread.They are cleaned
 out once a week, they are not very    
 tame as they scratch.Our class looks  
 after 2 animals.Kevin the Gerbil and  
 Errol the Hamster.We have a rota      
 to see who looks after them each week 
 Kevin lives in a fish tank filled     
 with peat, he likes to dig,Errol likes
 to sleep and eat.Andrea and I went    
 round the school asking people what   
 pets they kept. The most popular      
 pets were fish and the least popular  
 was a terrapin with lots of people    
 keeping dogs and cats.
