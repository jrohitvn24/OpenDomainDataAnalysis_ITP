		<content> 50% of the 92 residents in our{housing
 survey are in work. 15 housholds(47%) 
 have one resident in work and the same
 number have more than one.  The 1981  
{population}census 10% sample noted 7  
 men working for every 3 woman and     
{social class}skewed upwards.  Our 1985
 survey includes the occupations of 61 
 people and confirms these census      
 findings.  Of 33 men, almost all can  
 be classified as Professional /       
 Managerial, though a few occupations  
 are vague.  Occuring more than once   
 are Managering Director-4, Farmer-4,  
 Teacher-3, Physicist-2, Engineer-2,   
 Official-2.  There are also 3 students
 and 2 retired.  The 28 woman include 5
 school girls, 8 in various types of   
 work and 15 houswives, an occupation  
 which seems to have no retiring age.  
 Kingscote is no longer a working      
 community. It is a dormitory village. </content>
