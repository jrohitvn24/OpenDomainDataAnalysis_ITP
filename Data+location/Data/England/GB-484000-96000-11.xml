 Sidlesham has many people who are good
 at Art and Craft.  Most of them do    
 their work as a hobby but some earn   
 their living at it.  There is a       
 professional photographer and a lady  
 who paints in oil and water colour.   
 She does silk screen printing too.    
 She teaches Art at the Chichester     
 College of Further Education.         
      There is also a professional     
 flower arranger.  The Good            
 Companions is a group of old age      
 pensioners who meet regularly and make
 stuffed toys and wooden toys such as  
 rocking chairs and coffee tables. They
 sell these to help run their club.    
 The Womens' Institute do various      
 crafts such as corn dollies,          
 needlework and cookery.  A few ladies 
 have taken up spinning.
