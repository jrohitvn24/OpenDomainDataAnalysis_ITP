		<content> Wanlip Water Reclamation Works is run 
 by the Severn Trent Water Authority.  
 It was opened in 1964 and serves a    
 population of 305,00 from Leicester as
 far as Groby and Markfield.           
    The plant employs 100 workers and  
 plans are in hand to meet the expected
 increase in population. Planning for  
 the future is very important, they are
 planning for new developments up to   
 2030.                                 
    Liquid waste is treated and then   
 fed into the River Soar. Solid waste  
 produces methane gas which is used on 
 site to power the plant. The remaining
 solid waste is sold as a fertiliser   
 called Lescost.                       
    There is little smell from the     
 works and the authority displays great
 concern about the environment. They   
 were very pleased to talk to us and   
 gave us leaflets to study.            </content>
