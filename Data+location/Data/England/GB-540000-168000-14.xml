		<title>14The High Street,Chislehurst</title>
		<content>                                       
People's attitudes in Chislehurst are  
probably typical of the area.They are  
very anxious to keep the character of  
the High St., which still has village  
features. The oldest stretch, near     
the pond, was wide enough to turn a    
cart. Trees and parking spaces now     
narrow it. The   Church at one end and 
pond and common the other give it a    
village look.                          
This impression is lost on weekdays    
because of the pressure of traffic,    
particularly between 8 and 9.30am and  
5 and 6.30pm. Shoppers felt that the   
High St.was no longer a place to browse
and linger as it has the feel of a     
through road. They also felt that the  
building of a supermarket has caused   
traffic chaos and caused businesses to 
close down.People worry that the High  
St.may be losing its individuality.    </content>
