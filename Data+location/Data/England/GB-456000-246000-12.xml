		<content>{LOIS WEEDON VILLAGE HALL}:  originally
 built for the W.I., was rennovated in 
 1984 by volunteer helpers.  It is now 
 used for a meeting place by all       
 Groups, as well as being the dining   
 hall for the Village School.          
 For the very young there is a Play    
 Group three times a week.  The same   
 energy levels are needed by the adults
 for the Aerobics classes.  The general
 interest in gardening is reflected by 
 the Horticultural Society, Flower and 
 Garden Club and Flower Arranging      
 classes who all have regular meetings 
 here.  Flower arranging is of a high  
 standard, with members winning many   
 prizes at Northampton Show in 1985.   
 There is still room on the calendar   
 for Lois Weedon &amp; Weston Women's Ins- 
 titute to hold their monthly meetings,
 &amp; to shelter the May Day Fete or other
 Village Occasions in wet weather.     </content>
