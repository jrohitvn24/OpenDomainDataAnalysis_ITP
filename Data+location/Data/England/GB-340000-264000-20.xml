		<title>20THE W.I. IN AYMESTREY</title>
		<content>  {The Leinthall Earles and Aymestrey  
{WI}is an amalgamation of 2 groups and 
 the 20 or so members meet in Aymestrey
 Village Hall once a month. After      
 dealing with necessary business a talk
 or demonstration is given mainly of   
 rural or domestic interest but the new
 image WI is trying to widen the range 
 of activities. The average age is over
 40 but there is no lack of energy or  
 enthusiasm for the organisation which,
 until recently, provided the only     
 social outlet for women in the area.  
 The annual jumble sale, outings.      
 Christmas Dinner and party for the    
 local children are much enjoyed and   
 the WI is involved in organisation and
 catering for most Village functions.  
   It is the members of this group with
 help from husbands and friends who    
 have collected the information for    
 this section of the survey.           </content>
