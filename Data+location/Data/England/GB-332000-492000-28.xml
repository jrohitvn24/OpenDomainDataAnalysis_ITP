Wildlife conservation is important, with a team of dedicated rangers surveying the area and improving habitats by erecting bird and bat boxes, creating wetland areas, and controlling deer numbers.&lt;br />&lt;br />The main trade is now recreation and the tourist industry. Public access to all parts of the woodland is encouraged. As well as a mountain bike trail on the west side of the forest and more general cycle routes, there are many way-marked routes for walking, with maps for all obtainable from the Visitor Centre Shop. Orienteering, both on foot and by bicycle is also popular.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are a number of official car parks, with parking charges now introduced on four of them. Old quarries and former timber storage areas are also used for parking.&lt;br />&lt;br />The RAC rally no longer takes place; instead, two smaller car rallies take place, one in November and one in March. These are limited to the west side of the forest and cau se little inconvenience for residents.   &lt;br />
