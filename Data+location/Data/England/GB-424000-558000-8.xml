		<content> We made up a questionaire about sport 
 and leisure. We sent these home with  
 children from our school. We found    
 that swimming was the most popular    
 sport of all. On our survey we found  
 that women do not play as much sport  
 as men. They did, however, play a wide
 variety of sport ranging from darts   
 and snooker to badminton and golf. We 
 found that men play snooker, darts and
 football,some enjoyed doing weight    
 lifting and jogging. The only people  
 who did not have swimming as their    
 favourite sport were young people     
 under 25, they like football best of  
 all. We did have some people who said 
 that they never took part in any      
 sport. Most people took part in some  
 kind of sport at least once a week.
