		<title>01 THE STRATFORD AREA</title>
		<content>  This area covers the SW outskirts of 
Stratford and,further out,the villages 
of Clifford Chambers to the SE and     
Luddington to the SW,which are         
separated by the River Avon.           
  Visitors are attracted by Anne       
Hathaway's cottage in Shottery and the 
Steeplechase Course-a race course and  
camp site. There is a Horticultural    
Research Station at Luddington and a   
number of small farms.                 
  The population is concentrated in the
NE where there are several attractive  
housing estates,schools and a few small
shops.Old Town,a Victorian development 
of terraced houses begins to the east  
of the Evesham Road,the main road      
serving the area and many Bed and      
Breakfast establishments are to be     
found here.                            
  Traffic congestion is bad on Market  
Fridays and during summer months.      </content>
