		<title>13GOING TO WORK FROM ALTON</title>
		<content>People don't come to live in Alton     
because they work there but because    
it is a nice quiet village and they    
can get away from all the bustle of    
town and city life. There is hardly    
any employment in Alton and so many    
people who live there travel to the    
Potteries,Uttoxeter,Cheadle and Leek.  
Many people travel about 16 miles to   
work each day.A lot of professional    
people come to live in Alton.          
Occupations include accountants,nurses,
directors,shipping clerks,teachers,    
lecturers,insurance brokers,           
psychologists,doctors,decorators,      
shopkeepers and merchants.             
   Many people live on a new estate    
called Glen Drive,  built on open      
fields.There are 37 houses but the     
last number is 38.There isn't a number 
13 as some people are superstitious and
consider it unlucky.                   </content>
