		<title>09THE ECOLOGY OF WINCHESTER</title>
		<content>   The soil in this area is an alkaline
 chalky soil. Most of the wild flowers 
 and{trees}are alkaline loving plants. 
 The beech tree grows exceptionally    
 well in the chalky soil. A lot of the 
 hedgerows in the area are hawthorn,   
 which also grows very well in chalk.  
 Milk wort, cowslips, rock roses, eye  
 bright, twayblade and salad burnet are
 all alkaline loving{plants}and are    
 found in abundance. Scabious and hare 
 bells are also chalk loving plants,   
 but are often hidden by long grasses  
 like quaking grass.Often bluebells are
 found underneath beach trees where    
 wildlife such as rabbits, roe deer,   
 squirrels and a few foxes live. The   
 farming land in this area is used for 
 arable crops, particularly barley.    
 Recent road-building on the M3        
 motorway has brought conservation much
 to our minds.                         </content>
