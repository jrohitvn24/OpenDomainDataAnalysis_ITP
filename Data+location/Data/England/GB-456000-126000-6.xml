		<content> Freeman's also buy English timber.    
 They used to cut down their own trees 
 but now they employ other people.     
 We saw tree trunks being cut up with a
 saw that is a continuous band,powered 
 by electricity.Some of the sawn wood  
 goes into a machine called a planer to
 make it very smooth.                  
      They used to use steam traction  
 engines with big belts to drive the   
 machinery.They also pulled the timber 
 wagons.You can still see a place by   
 the River Itchen in the village where 
 they got water for their boilers.     
      All the timber is stored under   
 cover in big wooden sheds with slats  
 to let the air through to help the    
 wood to dry.
