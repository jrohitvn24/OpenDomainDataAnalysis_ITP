		<content> The School is a Church of England     
 Voluntary Aided Primary School        
 situated in Great Ryburgh with an     
 Infant Annexe in Stibbard.  The roll  
 is 114, and the children come from    
 the parishes of Great and Little      
 Ryburgh, Gateley, Stibbard, Wood      
 Norton, Guist and Twyford. In 1979 the
 school was established as a{"cluster" 
 school under one Headteacher as a     
 possible alternative to the closure of
 small village schools. All 8-11 year  
 olds from the 7 parishes were bussed  
 to Great Ryburgh. The 5-7 year olds   
 remained in Annexes at Guist and      
 Stibbard to be educated close to home.
 Great Ryburgh also had its own Infant 
 class. Guist Annexe closed in July    
 1983 and the children transferred to  
 Stibbard. Ryburgh Infants had already 
 moved to Stibbard due to staff        
 cutbacks in September 1981.           </content>
