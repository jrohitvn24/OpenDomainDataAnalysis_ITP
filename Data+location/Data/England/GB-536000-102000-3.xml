 Many wished to see more local sport   
 and leisure facilities,especially for 
 the young. They saw the need for a    
 children's park, adequate disposal of 
 sewage,proper control of traffic and  
 access to relevant and up to date     
 books in the Library. Many felt       
 that Britain is characterised by a    
 them and us class system which        
 prevents people from initiating       
 meaningful xhange and dealing with    
 society's fundamental problems.       
 Many felt a desire to live in         
 countries where there is more scope   
 for use of leisure time. They felt    
 that the l98O's will be judged as a   
 time of general disillusion.
