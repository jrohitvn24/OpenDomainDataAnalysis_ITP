		<title>16OCKBROOK VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> Village life has been greatly affected
 by the building of the{Borrowash      
{by-pass}which cut off the southern end
 of {Cole Lane}from the rest of the    
 village.South of the by-pass people   
 identify themselves more with         
 Borrowash and use the many amenities  
 available there.North of the by-pass  
 the amenities are few.Although there  
 are some shops, most people shop      
 outside the village especially since  
 the building of a hypermarket 3 or 4  
 miles away.There is quick vehicular   
 access to Derby Nottingham and M1.With
 little or no work in the village,     
 people have to travel to work.As the  
 bus service only starts at 09.30(half 
 hourly),villagers are obliged to use  
 private transport.Those staying in the
 village have only church groups and   
 the Women's Institute to occupy them. 
 Ockbrook can be a very lonely place.  </content>
