		<title>16     "LIFE" MAGAZINE</title>
		<content>    Known as the "Gt. Staughton &amp; Perry
{LIFE}Magazine", its aim is to give    
 full coverage to all aspects of life  
 within the local area. It is produced 
 on a voluntary basis once a month by a
 Magazine Committee. All running costs 
 are met from Advertising Revenue,     
 Annual Subscriptions from sponsoring  
 organisations and Donations.          
    Through this local medium news of  
 people and events in our area can be  
 given, views and ideas expressed and  
 important information - like the list 
 of Associations &amp; Contacts and local  
 Emergency Telephone Numbers - written.
    The Magazine is distributed, free, 
 to each household and is probably the 
 most effective means of keeping folk  
 in touch with community events.       
 Celebrating its tenth year in 1986,   
 the success of{LIFE}is a tribute to   
 all who work hard for its production. </content>
