		<title>12THE RIVER BURE</title>
		<content> The River Bure is by far the most     
 important geographical feature in this
 D_BLOCK. It winds its way for about   
 six kilometres over the area. Its flow
 is checked by the mill at Buxton. At  
 one time there used to be a lock at   
 this point but this has long since    
 disappeared. It is shallow and slow   
 moving and is on average about 5m     
 wide. It flows into the North Sea at  
 Great Yarmouth after passing through  
 The Broads of which it is the main    
 river. It is not navigable at this    
 point only by canoes and light craft. 
  All the usual water and waterside    
 plants grow here, there being no      
 special ones.                         
 The river contains stocks of bream,   
 roach, dace, perch, gudgeon and pike. 
 Birds which are seen regularly on the 
 river are mute swans, Canada geese,   
 moorhens, mallard and herons.         </content>
