		<title>03LANDSCAPE DYMCHURCH SEA WALL</title>
		<content> When we were at the top of the sea    
 wall everyone had the urge to run down
 to the beach. The wind was blowing and
 the sea wall was slippery and slimy so
 people were sliding over. The concrete
 was cold to sit on. Barnacles and     
 mussels were clinging on to the       
 groynes and breakers. In parts where  
 the wall was decaying, little pools of
 water made homes for stranded crabs   
 and starfish. Ladybirds which live    
 higher up in the wall were crawling   
 into the tiniest little nooks and     
 crannies they could find. The sea was 
 greeny blue colour and at the horizon 
 the sky matched it. The view on the   
 road was very clear but when a lorry  
 came dust flew up and settled on the  
 wall. We looked past the road to the  
 green fields and the hazy hills       
 beyond.
