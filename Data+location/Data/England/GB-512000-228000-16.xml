		<title>16WELLBURY HOUSE</title>
		<content> Also there is a unit for 3 boys in    
 Hitchin.The aims of the house are to  
 enable boys from disturbed situations 
 to cope more effectively,to provide   
 the alternative if the situation is   
 intolerable or to change the situation
 if it appears feasible to do so.      
 The boys come from the South of       
 England,are aged 11-14 years on       
 admission and can stay until they     
 are 18 years.They are in the care of  
 the Local Authority and the cost is   
 Â£450 a week.The two junior groups aim 
 to develop purposeful relationships   
 with the boys,and to fulfil the aims  
 already mentioned.The group for older 
 boys seeks to prepare them for        
 independence by enabling them to care 
 for themselves under supervision.In   
 the unit in Hitchin the boys live     
 independently,practicing the skills   
 they have learnt before leaving.      </content>
