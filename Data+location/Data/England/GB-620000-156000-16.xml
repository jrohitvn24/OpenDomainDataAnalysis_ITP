		<content> The residents of all the villages live
 a healthy life and much health care is
 prevention. A General Practitioner    
 living in Littlebourne has a surgery  
 on the Hill and has a community nurse 
 to assist him. An antenatal clinic is 
 held monthly and most mothers go to   
 the Kent and Canterbury Hospital for  
 birth and return home to be looked    
 after by the community midwife. A     
 child care clinic is held monthly     
 where checks are made on pre-school   
 children and immunisation against     
 whooping cough, measles, tetanus,     
 polio and diptheria are carried out. A
 school health service looks after     
 booster immunisation. A well womens   
 clinic is held monthly to check       
 breasts, cervical smears and family   
 planning. The surgery is open daily   
 for consultations and visits are      
 made to people in their own homes.    </content>
