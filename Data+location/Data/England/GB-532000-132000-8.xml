		<title>08CHIDDINGLYE WOOD</title>
		<content> This lies in the valley on the east   
 side of the B.2028 road south of      
{Chiddinglye Farm.}The trees are mainly
 deciduous with{rhododendrons}planted  
 in the last century. The west side    
 falls steeply from the road with much 
 of the sandstone exposed with trees,  
 mainly beech, growing well out of the 
 rock. The{Cob Brook,}a tributary of   
 the{Ouse,}flows through the wood and  
 there is a{hammer pond}which powered a
 furnace when the iron industry        
 flourished in the area. There are many
 sandstone outcrops including the rock 
{Great Upon Little.}On the SE border is
 a rocky promontory between two        
 valleys, the site of a large{Romano   
{British camp}protected on three sides 
 by a horseshoe of rocks, its apex     
 Great Upon Little.                    
   Both wood and camp are privately    
 owned.                                </content>
