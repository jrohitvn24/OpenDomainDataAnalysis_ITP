		<title>05INTERVIEW WITH A FISHERMAN</title>
		<content>6.Have you ever had any accidents?     
  Accidents are few and far between.   
The only accident I can recall was a   
lady falling over the landing stage.   
But accidents on the boat no.          
7.What are your feelings about taking  
out groups like us?                    
  It is fun. I love your chat.         
8.Are you often seasick?               
  No never. I do not like rough sea    
mind you.                              
                                       
  Like many others in the area this    
fisherman now makes his living from the
tourists rather than from fishing. His 
income comes from taking out groups    
like ours.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
