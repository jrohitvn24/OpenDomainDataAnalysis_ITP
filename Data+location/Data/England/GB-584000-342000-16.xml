		<title>16BURNHAM MARKET SCHOOL</title>
		<content> There are 150 children attending the  
 school and there are seven teachers.  
 Their names are: Mrs. Evans, Mrs.     
 Kimberlin, Mrs. Crouch, Mrs. Hooke,   
 Mrs. Bruce, Mrs. Nudds and Mr. Aitken 
 is the Headteacher.  The children who 
 come to Burnham Market School live in 
 lots of different villages around     
 Burnham Market and they come to school
 in two mini-buses.  We have lots of   
 different lessons like English, Maths,
 Art and Craft, French and we also have
 a swimming lesson once a fortnight at 
 the Alderman Peel High School in      
 Wells.  Everyone at school stays for  
 lunch.  Some children have packed     
 lunches which they eat in the dining  
 hall with the children who have school
 dinners.  In the summer we sometimes  
 eat our packed lunches out on the     
 grass in the sunshine.
