		<content> In December 1981 the Penlee lifeboat  
                                       
 the Solomon Brown went to the help of 
 a stricken tanker in heavy seas off   
 Lamorna.The lifeboat managed to take  
 off four crew members but in so doing 
 was sunk herself.Both ships sank and  
 everyone drowned.                     
 The new lifeboat is called the Mabel  
 Alice after the wife of the man who   
 donated the money,instead of          
 being housed in the lifeboat station  
 at Penlee Point this boat can be found
 in Newlyn harbour.                    
 The new coxwain is Mr. Ken Thomas     
 whose daughter Sharon is in our class.
 Last week there was an inquest at the 
 Queens Hotel on the Promenade in      
 Penzance into the deaths of four      
 school children from Stoke Poges      
 Middle School, who drowned in the sea 
 off Lands End.                        </content>
