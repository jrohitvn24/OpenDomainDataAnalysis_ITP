 my mum's house and then on to my      
 gran's where we have lunch and dinner 
 and play cards.My mum takes me home at
 bedtime and then I go to bed.         
                                       
{Saturday:}I wake up at 7.00 and I read
 or listen to the radio for an hour    
 until it is time to get up for        
 breakfast.I have a{swimming}lesson in 
 Leominster at 9.30 so we have to leave

 Post Office to spend my pocket money  
 and then I watch television or play   
 outside until lunchtime.After lunch we
 often go out to look at a{garden}or   
 something.There is often a tea stall  
 so we have drink and a cake before    
 going home.I usually have an hour to  
 watch television or play on my bike   </content>
