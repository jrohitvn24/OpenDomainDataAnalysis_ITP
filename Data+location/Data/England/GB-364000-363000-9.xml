		<content> The 2 favourite children's games are  
 'Tick' and 'Kick the Can'.They are    
 best played by about 10 children.In   
 'Tick'one child is 'on'.The others are
 given a few seconds to run away.The   
 one who is 'on' chases and tries to   
 'tick' or touch the others.There are  
 many variations of the                
 game-e.g.'Shadow Tick'when the chaser 
 has to jump on the others' shadows or 
 'Scarecrow Tick' where the touched    
 players have to stand still until     
 released by being tagged by a         
 colleague.                            
 In 'Kick the Can' the player who is   
 'on' has to cover his face while the  
 others hide.The object is to find them
 all before they return to base and    
 kick over a tin can. If they all do so
 the original child is 'on' again      
 otherwise thefirst child to be caught 
 is now 'on'.                          </content>
