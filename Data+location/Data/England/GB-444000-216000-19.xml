  Shipton-on-Cherwell is an Oxfordshire
village. The Oxford Canal and river run
by the village.                        
  There is a church, two post boxes, a 
telephone box, a village hall, about   
twenty small houses,and a few large    
expensive ones. One of these expensive 
houses is a recording studio for       
"Virgin Records". Twelve people are    
employed there, these twelve are from  
outside the village. The barn next to  
the house is used for recording.The    
artists who come, stay in the          
house. They are mostly popstars from   
the "Top 10".  The main village was    
destroyed probably by the cement       
works. Most people in the village work 
in the quarry.                         
  In the village there is a coal yard  
which also hires out mini skips for    
rubbish.                               </content>
