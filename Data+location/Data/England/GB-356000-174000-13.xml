		<content>{WESTBURY PARK                         
  Mr Higson moved to this house in 1930
 at the age of six .Over the years,many
 young people have moved in to the area
 to occupy bedsitters which were once  
 family occupied houses.               
  Traffic is noisier now and the       
 classes are more mixed.There is a     
 caring community sprit with good      
 provision for the elderly.Young people
 have been left with out there own     
 organisation since the closure of the 
 Youth Fellowship(1942-1950).          
  Sunday is much like any other day    
 now,more shops open,not many children 
 go to Sunday school,people visit      
 cinemas and theatres now and nobody   
 bothers with wearing 'Sunday Best' the
 best times were 1945 to 1954.With the 
 war restrictions lifted you could     
 travel and have things like fireworks 
 and not bother with blackout.         </content>
