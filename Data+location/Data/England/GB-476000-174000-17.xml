		<title>17Redingensians Rugby Club.</title>
		<content>    The first game was played about 60 
 years ago when a group of boys who had
 left school decided to carry on       
 playing. They named the team{Old      
{Redingensians.                        
    Their playing ground is by the A4  
 in Sonning.It covers several acres and
 includes cricket and rugby pitches.   
    There isn't a membership fee but   
 you can pay Â£5 to be a non-playing    
 member. The club has 200 junior &amp;     
 senior members who play for pleasure  
 and competition.                      
    Minor injuries are common although 
 one boy has had a broken leg.         
    If the club wins 24 out of 34      
 matches, it has been a good season.   
    There are 6/7 trophies which       
 members can keep for a year.
