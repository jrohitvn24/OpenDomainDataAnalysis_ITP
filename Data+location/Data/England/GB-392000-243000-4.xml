 Pershore has seen many changes during 
 its thousand year history.  The       
 religious quarrels of the{Reformation}
 which wasted much of the{Abbey of Holy
{Cross}have been replaced by an{       
{Ecumenical Covenant}which links the   
 Christian religions of Pershore in    
 our Modern Times. The{famous medieval 
{bridge,}the last of its kind over the 
 Avon, now lives in the shadow of the  
 modern road bridge.                   
 Pershore still retains the peace and  
 tranquillity of its river setting but 
 modern traffic roars along the High   
 Street to remind its inhabitants of   
 the fumes, noise and bustle of modern 
 living.  The original inhabitants are 
 few but it has attracted a new, young,
 vigorous community who have preserved 
 its character and are conscious of its
 past.                                 </content>
