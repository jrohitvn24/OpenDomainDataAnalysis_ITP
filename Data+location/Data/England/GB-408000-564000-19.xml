		<content>{THE LITTER PICK                       
  The litter pick is an annual event in
 Wylam. It is held in April/May. The   
 parish council gives a pound for      
 everyone involved to the organization 
 of the persons choice. Brownies,      
 scouts, shelter, etc.. raise money in 
 this way. The village is split in to  
 sections for each organization to     
 'tidy!' and at 12'o'clock, after two  
 hours work, all the groups reassemble 
 to hand in their sacks. Usally over   
 100 people turn up, mostly children.  
{WYLAM

 bank of the river Tyne approximatley  
 10.5 miles from Newcastle and about 11

 community spirit amoung the
