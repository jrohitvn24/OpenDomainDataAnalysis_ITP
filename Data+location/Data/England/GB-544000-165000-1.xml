		<content>{Orpington} is a suburb to the {South  
East of London}. Although there have   
been settlements since {Roman Times}   
the main developments in the area      
started in the {1920s and 1930s}.      
Being close to the countryside, but    
with {railway services} to central     
London, it is a popular {residential   
area for commuters}.                   
Many of the houses in {Petts Wood} are 
mock-Tudor in style. In {Orpington}    
itself there are more conventional     
detached and semi-detached houses. In  
{St Mary Cray} many of the houses are  
older than in the rest of the area.    
{The Ramsden Estate} consists mainly of
flats and maisonettes.
