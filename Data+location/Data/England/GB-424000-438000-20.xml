		<title>20Farming</title>
		<content> The farmers in the area are becoming  
 increasingly angry as their farms are 
 being decreased to nothing.At the     
 reformation centre,there was a large  
 farm when it opened in 1857 but now   
 there is hardly anything.Open fields  
 could be seen in the beginning but    
 nowthere are only small patches of    
 grass where animals eat from and      
 turnips for the sheep.                
 WALTON FARM                           
 This fram has 27 cows,but no other    
 animals apart from 2 dogs.It is next  
 to the golf course.The cows go into   
 the fields eating grass during        
 summer,but go inside during winter to 
 eat silage,brewers grains and sugar   
 beet pulp.This farm is lucky because  
 it has escaped the growing city and   
 has been able to grow crops           
 annually.This year a good crop of     
 potatoes and wheat is expected.       </content>
