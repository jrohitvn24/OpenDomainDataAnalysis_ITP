		<title>10GOLF CLUB, BRACKNELL.</title>
		<content>   On the{Golf Course}the ground cover 
 is mainly fern and heather with       
 rhodedendrons in abundance.  This is  
 the environment which provided the    
 home, sixty years ago, for the        
 prestigious{Berkshire Golf Club.}     
   The Club is the proud owner of two  
 courses, North and South, Red and     
 Blue, a large club house with its own 
 restaurant, and a shop, which sells   
 all manner of general golfing         
 parafernalia.  There are a few houses 
 and bungalows for the staff.          
   The sandy nature of the soil        
 necessitates a sophisticated          
{irrigation scheme}to the greens.  This
 work is currently being carried out   
 and will enable irrigation to be      
 controlled by a pump at each green.   
 The club owns four-wheeled "search    
 cars" for the elderly or infirm,or the
 merely idle!                          </content>
