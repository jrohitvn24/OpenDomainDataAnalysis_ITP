		<title>03The Leftwich Coal Merchant</title>
		<content> Mr. Broady,the coal merchant is the   
 middle man between the coal producer  
 and the customer.He serves homes and  
 some local industries.He delivers coal
 in bags on a lorry.The Broadies have  
 been coal merchants for three         
 generations.Mr. Broady started work   
 when he was 14 years old,and his      
 Father when he was 11 years old.The   
 price of coal today is relatively more
 expensive than in the past.In 1903,for
 instance,coal was 2s 6d a bag; and in 
 1985 it is Â£4.45 a bag.               
    Many people still use coal.Nowadays
 they have started building houses     
 again with chimneys,unlike 20 years   
 ago.
