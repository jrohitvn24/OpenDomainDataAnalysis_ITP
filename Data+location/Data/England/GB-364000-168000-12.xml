		<title>12Old Railway Path.</title>
		<content>   The Old Railway Path is thirteen    
 miles long. It is now used for walking
 and cycling. The trains stopped in    
 1971 because the line was competing   
 with another line and it lost         
 business. The cyclepath runs from     
 Bristol to Bath. Two of the places you
 can join the path are Saltford and    
 Bitton Station. There is one official 
 picnic site where the path crosses the
 River Avon near Bitton. However there 
 are many other nice spots for picnics 
 such as Saltford.                     
   The first section of the path was   
 built in 1979 between Bitton and Bath 
 by Cyclebag (a cycling group in       
 Bristol) and the rest of the path     
 has been built since about 1982. They 
 are just finishing the last section   
 into Bristol.
