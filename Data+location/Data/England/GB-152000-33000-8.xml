		<title>08Religion: St. Erth Church</title>
		<content>            The Saint                  
      The Parish, Church and village of
 St. Erth receive their name from an   
 Irishman who lived from 424 to 5l4 A.D
 He was Ercus. or Erc, son of Deagh,   
 who had been baptised by the aged     
 St.Patrick and then consecrated Bishop
 of Slane, in Ireland.   He was the    
 brother of St. Ia and St. Uny, who    
 came with him across the Channel to   
 found their respective churches, Ia to
 St.Ives, Uny to Lelant and Ercus to   
 St.Erth.                              
      At that time ships sailed inland 
 as far as where the medieval bridge   
 now spans the Hayle River, and it was 
 about here that Ercus must have       
 landed.  Tradition has it that a      
 Church was built and that Ercus       
 consecrated it. Certain it is that the
 place has been called "St.Erth"       
 (variously spelt) ever since.         </content>
