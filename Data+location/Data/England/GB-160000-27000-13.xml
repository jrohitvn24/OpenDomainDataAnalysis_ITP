 Recently the Rio Tinto Zinc Company   
 have shown interest in the spoil heaps
 which surround the old Wheal Vor      
 workings. These spoil heaps contain 2%
 tin. The vegetation and soil covering 
 the heaps was removed and the spoil   
 heaps were transported by lorry to the
 Wheal Jane tin mine where the tin was 
 removed. The waste from this process  
 was then returned to Wheal Vor, the   
 top soil was returned and reseeded.   
 The farmer who now owns the land did  
 not receive any money for the tin but 
 has received good agricultural land   
 where before there was only spoil     
 heaps.
