		<content>  On the local moor there are{bronze   
 age hut circles.                      
  The fields near the moor are small   
 and irregular shape,probably meaning  
 they were built in{prehistoric}times. 
  Some farms are called{"bartons"}(e.g.
 Gnatham Barton),meaning they had stone
 buildings very early on.              
  Fields away from the moor are more   
 modern, large and regular shaped.     
{ St.Mary's}church in Walkhampton is   
 mostly five hundred years old.        
  The oldest buildings in Walkhampton  
 are 18th-19th{miner's}cottages,there  
 were copper mines in the Walkham      
 valley.                               
  A disused{railway line}(Yelverton -  
 Princetown)is now used by walkers.It  
 was closed in 1956.
