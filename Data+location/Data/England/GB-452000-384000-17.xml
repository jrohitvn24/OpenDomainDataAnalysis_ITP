		<title>17A Day in My Life</title>
		<content> I am a {diabetic} which means I have  
 to have a high fibre{diet.}I do not   
 have sugar in my tea or even on       
 cereals like "Weetabix" and "Bran     
 Flakes" etc. I must only have one pint
 of pasteurised milk a day, the rest   
 has to be skimmed.  I have to have two
{insulin}injections a day or else I    
 will die.  I can  have{sweets}some    
 times but if I do I must have even    
 more exercise otherwise my sugar will 
 go up and I will feel sick.  And if I 
 don't have enough I will go low and I 
 will pass out.  Its very hard to keep 
 stable and not to be able to eat{     
{sweets}and sometimes I give in. I hope
 in the future there will be a cure.
