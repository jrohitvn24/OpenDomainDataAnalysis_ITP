		<title>17HEBBURN QUAY</title>
		<content> This area was settled because of the  
{River Tyne.Andrew Leslie}from Glasgow 
 chose this area to open his           
{shipbuilding}yard over 100 years      
 ago.There followed houses for the     
 workers, a school and a church.These  
 buildings are still there.Ten years   
 ago the Quay had become very run      
 down.The{council}had bought the       
{terraced houses}and people did not    
 want to live there, preferring newer  
 houses in different parts of          
 Hebburn.The council decided to sell   
 them rather than pull them down and   
 gave large grants to modernise the    
 properties.Work is still going on to  
 improve the area by{renovation}and    
 landscaping.Most residents are happy  
 to stay there.Due to unemployment the 
 area is poor but it is once again a   
{community. }
