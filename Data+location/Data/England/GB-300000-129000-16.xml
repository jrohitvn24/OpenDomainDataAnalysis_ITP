		<title>16A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> We have a vegetable garden but because
 the house is 950 feet above sea level 
 it is quite difficult to grow them but
 we do grow a lot of lettuce, carrots, 
 peas and potatoes.                    
 We usually go on holiday in the       
 summer. Last summer we flew from      
 Gatwick airport to Faro in Portugal.  
 We stayed in Albufiera for two weeks. 
 Once we took a boat on the river      
 Thames for a week and another time we 
 hired a boat on the Norfolk Broads.   
 One of my grandmothers lives in       
 Hertfordshire and the other near      
 Bristol so I don't see them very often
 but they do come and stay with us.    
 Once or twice a week my father goes to
 London on the train. He leaves here at
 6.45 am, has breakfast on the train   
 and gets to London at 9.30. He gets   
 home at 7.00 in the evening for       
 supper.                               </content>
