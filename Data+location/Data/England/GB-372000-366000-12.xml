		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN CRANAGE</title>
		<content>     As we prepare the Domesday Book   
 our country has a lot of              
 unemployment.However the area we live 
 in is very fortunate as a high        
 proportion of the people have jobs.   
 Locally there is the hospital which   
 employs nursing and medical           
 staff,gardeners,administrators and    
 maintenance men. In Holmes Chapel     
 there are shops and of course a large 
 number of farms. There is also the    
 animal feed mill and a fertiliser     
 company quite near.                   
      Quite a large number have to     
 travel further afield to work. There  
 are large companies such as ICI in    
 Alderley Edge,Macclesfield, Wilmslow  
 Crewe and Manchester.The local people 
 travel there daily by car but some may
 travel by train from the station in   
 Holmes Chapel.
