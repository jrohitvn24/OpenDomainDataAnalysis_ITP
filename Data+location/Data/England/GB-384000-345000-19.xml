The parish church at Hartshill is      
called Holy Trinity Church.A windmill  
stood on the land for many years, but  
was demolished to make way for the     
church.                                
Herbert Minton gave the money for the  
church to be built.He was a pottery    
manufacturer in Stoke.Inside the church
on the floor and on the walls there are
tiles which were made by Herbert       
Minton.No other church has tiles like  
this.The first service was held on 10th
October 1842.Herbert Minton is buried  
in the chancel.The church was designed 
by Sir George Gilbert Scott.It has a   
tall spire.In the vestry is a stained  
glass window in memory of Clive of     
India and his family.                  
The church plays a full part in the    
community with a thriving Sunday School
and Brownies and Guides etc.           </content>
