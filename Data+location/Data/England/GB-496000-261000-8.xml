		<content> Mains water is laid on to all the     
 houses in the area.  The houses are   
 fed from a cast-iron{main}laid in the 
 1930's to feed the Lion standpipes,   
 which were placed at strategic points,
 such as the Chapel, Middle Farm,      
 Lamb's Cottage and the Granaries.  The
{standpipe}at the Chapel is still there
 but could not be persuaded to produce 
 water as it had seized up from lack of
 use.                                  
 Water was previously a problem in the 
 area in hot weather because the area  
 is relatively high and{wells}soon     
 dried up.                             
                                       
 Mains{sewers,}installed in 1983, run  
 into a sump at the site of one of the 
 old wells near Church Farm.  It is    
 pumped from there to a treatment plant
 adjoining Sharnbrook road railway     
 bridge.                               </content>
