		<title>16CUSTOMS-GOTHAM TALES</title>
		<content>   Gotham is well known for its tales  
 of the wise men.One of its most famous
 tales is about the cuckoo and how the 
 'wise men' tried to capture it.       
   Spring was a happy time for the     
 people of Gotham and every year they  
 waited for the cold winter to finish  
 and those lovely sunny days of spring 
 to come. Now the people of Gotham     
 often had meetings to discuss such    
 things,as why the sky was blue and how
 long a piece of string was.As spring  
 came when the cuckoo called,they      
 decided to search for the cuckoo and  
 bring it back to Gotham because they  
 wanted spring to stay all the year    
 round.                                
   The wise men built a fence around   
 the outside of the bush where the     
 cuckoo was, but of course the cuckoo  
 escaped,and so the people of Gotham   
 have all the seasons just like you.   </content>
