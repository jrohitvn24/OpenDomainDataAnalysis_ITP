		<title>15Puppet Making</title>
		<content> In the Summer Term of 1985,Great      
Horwood School enjoyed a presentation  
of puppets by Glenda Ramsay.Two puppet 
shows were followed by puppet          
workshops.                             
 The whole school took part in the     
making of puppets, which ranged from   
rod and glove puppets to shadow        
puppets. Many children grouped         
together and wrote their own plays or  
adapted fairy stories.These            
performances were presented to their   
class or the rest of the school and    
were greatly appreciated.              
 Puppet making workshops were held in  
the school hall and as many as sixty   
children took part during the lunch    
break.The children were able to select 
from a mountain of plastic pots,boxes, 
cartons and pieces of material with    
which they could make their puppets.
