		<content> The area is typical of the Cotswold   
 Scarp. The inferior oolite which      
 outcrops at Cleeve Hill appears again 
 to the East of the Vale of Winchcombe,
 forming the impressive summit of      
 Salter's Hill. The scarp with its well
 drained soils attracted much early    
 settlement; Beckbury Camp (Grid       
 reference 064 298) and the tumuli at  
 Stumps Cross (Grid reference 076 305) 
 are evidence of the importance of     
 these hill-top locations. The contrast
 between the poor quality soils on the 
 oolite and the heavier, more fertile  
 middle and lower lias clays is clearly
 shown by the change in farming        
 patterns and settlement. This contrast
 is masked by the increasing acreage of
 arable crops planted on the marginal  
 upland soils.
