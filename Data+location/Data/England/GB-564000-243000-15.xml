		<content>On Sunday I go to Sunday school at the 
Methodist Church. My teacher is called 
Penny. In my group ther are Dominic,   
Kathleen, Zoe, Helen, Martin, Robert   
andie. We learn about God. We are going
to have Sports Day on 20th July. You   
can go to girls' club: you play games. 
Every summer we have a holiday club. We
do sponsored walks and sponsored       
silences. We try to win a medal by     
doing a Scripture exam. We sometimes go
on trips: on the rec, to Clare country 
park and the railway. We pay 10p for   
girls' club and the same for Sunday    
school. Last year Sandra &amp; Graham got  
married. We sang "Love is something if 
you give it away".                     
 There are C of E churches in the area 
&amp; a RC church. There are no            
non-Christian places of worship.
