There is a sewage treatment plant in   
Pigeon House Lane, which is a very old 
lane between Church Hanborough and     
Freeland. The plant is well hidden on a
west facing slope at GR 423128.        
                                       
It cleans the sewage for an area       
stretching from North Leigh to Bladon  
At the top of the slope are large      
rectangular filter beds, and after     
going through these the sewage is then 
sprayed onto circular filters through a
spray that rotates. The cleaned water  
flows out at the bottom of the site    
into an open stream where fish live,   
and which flows east into the Evenlode.
The man who works there showed us a    
bottle of the cleaned water. He said it
was drinkable, but it was yellow and it
would probably give us a tummy upset.
