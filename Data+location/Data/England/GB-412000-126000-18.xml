		<title>18MOTOR TRADE IN HARNHAM</title>
		<content> The garages in Harnham differ one from
 another and represent varing aspects  
 of the motor trade.                   
 Woodrows garage sells new BMW cars.It 
 also services cars and sells petrol   
 and has a small shop. Rex garage sells
 secondhand cars, services cars and    
 sells petrol. Its shop also serves    
 neighbouring houses along the Downton 
 Road (A338) as well as motorists. It  
 sells more petrol than Woodrows       
 (400_500 customers per day against    
 300). Both are on main roads. Beeton's
 garage is smaller servicing cars,     
 selling petrol and spares. It is off  
 the main road in Harnham. Rex and     
 Beeton's are family firms employing   
 local labour. Woodrows is part of a   
 larger company and its employees live 
 as far away as Downton.
