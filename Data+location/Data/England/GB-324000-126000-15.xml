		<title>15TODAY'S VILLAGE BOBBY</title>
		<content>  Creech Heathfield has a police house 
 where the village bobby lives with his
 family.                               
  The traditional image of the village 
 bobby is a jolly chap seen doing his  
 beat on his bicycle;he attends fetes, 
 etc and makes house calls to introduce
 himself and to get to know his wards. 
  Today's bobby has not got the time to
 do this.He is part of Taunton Constab-
 ulary.Although based at Creech,he gets
 sent all over Taunton.Any trouble in  
 the village will be radioed to him.He 
 patrols the village in his 1.3 litre  
 Ford Escort.He works alternate shifts:
 6am until 2pm;2 until 10pm and nights.
  Villagers are expected to phone the  
 Taunton station so the police house   
 number is not in the phone book.Vill- 
 agers have been known to call on him, 
 but this is rare.He gets more calls   
 from travellers,asking for directions.</content>
