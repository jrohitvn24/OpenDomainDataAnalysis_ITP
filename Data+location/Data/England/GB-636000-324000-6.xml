		<content> From the 32 responses to our          
 questionnaire,78% of the houses in    
 which those asked, lived, have been   
 built in the last 20 years.           
 Typically, most are semi-detatched    
 and are found on housing estates.     
 When buillt they were less than half  
 the price of similar accommodation in 
 urban areas, hence their attraction to
 those able to either work in the local
 seevice industries or to commute to   
 other areas daily.                    
 This pattern, however, is not true of 
 the whole of the D-Block, only in and 
 around the village of Stalham itself. 
 Here, in an accurate count based on   
 both electoral rolls and personal     
 observation, 656 (67.9%) of the 819   
 houses in the village have been built 
 in the last fifteen years:- Rivermead,
 Heron Gardens, Millside, Lyndford     
 Estate and the new council houses     </content>
