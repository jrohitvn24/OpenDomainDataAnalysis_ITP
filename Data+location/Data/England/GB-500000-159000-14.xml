		<content>  Georgina lives in Faris Lane.        
  I go to Brownies on Wednesdays. We   
 meet in the Church Hall at West       
 Byfleet and have: inspection, fun in  
 the Park, games, songs, book work,    
 badge work, visits, coffee mornings   
 and enrolment.  At the moment I am    
 doing my Friendship badge and my Pet  
 Lovers badge. For this badge I have to
 look after my pet goldfish for three  
 months. I am also doing a 75 year     
 booklet and filling in miles.         
  On Sundays we go for walks at Pyrford
 Woods, on the Golf Course or by the   
 Canal. Also we go to Church at Pyrford
 and my brother Andrew and I go to     
 Sunday School. In September we will go
 into the Explorers which is a higher  
 class. Sometimes we play tennis at    
 Halstead at weekends. Occasionally    
 Daddy takes our garden waste to the   
 rubbish tip in Martyr's Lane.         </content>
