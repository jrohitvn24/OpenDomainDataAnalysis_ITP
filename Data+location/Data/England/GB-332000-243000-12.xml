		<content> The Church of England is the only     
 religious body having places of       
 worship in the area. Members of other 
 denominations have to travel some     
 distance to attend services. There are
 two churches, St. Andrew's in         
 Bredwardine and St. Michael and All   
 Angels at Moccas, both dating back to 
 about the 12th Century. The present   
 Rector, Rev. W. King, has charge of   
 both and also the churches at         
 Hardwicke and Cusop. A joint Parish   
 Magazine, 'The Link', is produced and 
 this is also an important village     
 news-sheet since it contains items of 
 information of local interest as well 
 as church matters.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
