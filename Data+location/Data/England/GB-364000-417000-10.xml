		<content> Used by the army for manoeuvres during
 the Second World War, the area is now 
 being re-examined for long-buried     
 unexploded shells, bombs and mines,   
 prior to being offered for sale       
 still as agricultural land, by        
 the North West Water Authority at some
 future date.                          
 Meantime, it is used for a variety of 
 recreational pursuits, as it is part  
 of the West Pennine Moors Recreational
 Area, created in 1978.                
 There are many public footpaths, used 
 by ramblers and hikers, particularly  
 at weekends.  Duke of Edinburgh award 
 expeditions take place about six times
 a year, usually at night, and in all  
 weather conditions.  It is also ideal 
 for all orienteering activities.      
 Naturalists and bird watchers can find
 much to interest and occupy them.
