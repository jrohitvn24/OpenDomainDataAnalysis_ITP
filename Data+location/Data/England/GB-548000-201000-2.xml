		<content>   Ostensibly to decrease their losses 
 on the Central Line in Essex, LTE,    
 supported by the isolationist policies
 of its then controller, the GLC,      
 imposed ever greater fare premiums.   
 The inevitable result of what in the  
 end amounted to gross extortion was to
 greatly distort the pattern of public 
 transport in the area, with many      
 commuters switching to road transport 
 to inner area stations, resulting in  
 considerable congestion and parking   
 problems there.                       
   This was exactly what might have    
 been expected, and gives weight to the
 belief widely held by regular         
 travellers that the whole exercise was
 actually intended to drive away       
 traffic to further LTE's desire to    
 truncate the Central Line Service in  
 Essex.      {(continued)}
