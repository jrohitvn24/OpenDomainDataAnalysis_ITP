		<content>  St. Nicholas is an old church in a   
rural setting. There are 38 stained    
glass windows of all shapes and        
sizes.The organ has 23 pipes and       
they are probably made of tin or steel.
There are 6 bells and 50 pews which    
could hold about 120 people (approx).  
  The oldest grave, which still has    
writing, dates back to 1830 and belongs
to Sir Bernard Mortland and the pub    
across the road, The Bernard Arms,     
could be named after him. Gt. Kimble   
has a tower with 6 bells which will    
express high or low notes at the pull  
of the ropes. The roof is made of oak  
beams and the pulpit was given to the  
parish by Ann Murray. Also there is a  
brass framed picture of The Madonna    
which dates back to 1282.              
{Above all this is a very beautiful    
church.}
