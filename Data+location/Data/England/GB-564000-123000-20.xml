		<title>20JACK FULLER</title>
		<content>    Jack Fuller was a rich man and felt
 sorry for the English soldiers        
 returning from the Napoleanic Wars who
 didn't have any work to do. Some of   
 the buildings they built now need to  
 be repaired. Brightling Needle has    
 scaffolding around it because the     
 brickwork is crumbling and several    
 miles of wall need attention too.     
    Some rich Americans have given     
 money to make the necessary repairs to
 these 'follies'. Jack also built a    
 round tower in a patch of woodland    
 surrounded by fields. It use to be    
 hollow but now there is a spiral stair
 case and a ladder leading to the top. 
 There is a pub called the Fuller's    
 Arms in Brightling with lots of old   
 photographs hanging on the wall.      
 Legend recalls that he is buried      
 sitting at a table with a bottle of   
 wine in his hand - Mad Jack Fuller.   </content>
