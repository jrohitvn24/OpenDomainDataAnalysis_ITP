		<title>18Keswick's Guest Houses</title>
		<content> Running a guest house is hard work.Six
 thirty a.m.is time to get up.Then you 
 get the breakfast ready.Next you get  
 the packed lunches ready.After        
 breakfast its time to do the          
 bedrooms.First you strip the beds and 
 empty the bins and ashtrays. Then you 
 take the dirty sheets down stairs.Then
 cleaning comes next .The sinks ,the   
 toilets and the bathroom are          
 cleaned.Then you have your dinner.    
     I interviewed a restaurant        
 owner.He said he only sells food that 
 is local.I asked him when his busiest 
 season is and what sort of people he  
 gets. His reply was his busiest season
 is between July and October.He also   
 said he gets locals and tourists of   
 all nationalities.He said he prefers  
 Keswick to a city.
