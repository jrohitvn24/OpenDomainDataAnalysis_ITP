		<title>06ROBERT HALL FARM - THE HERD</title>
		<content> The stock at Robert Hall farm         
 comprises 80 milking cows, 20 heifers 
 (2 years old) 20 heifers (1 year old) 
 20 friesian bulls (beef) and 30       
 beef-cross calves (beef). In 1980 the 
 milking herd stood at 40 cows. This   
 number has since doubled and would    
 have reached 100 but for the EEC      
 restrictions. Mr Hope had to look for 
 an alternative to milking cows and    
 turned to beef; he is also considering
 sheep. The milk produced at Robert    
 Hall goes to the Milk Marketing Board 
 at Settle. Mr Hope is paid 14.838p a  
 litre which includes a set price for  
 each constituent in the milk. Dairy   
 farming used to be a more profitable  
 business than other farming and the   
 regular income is still a great help. 
 Owing to the EEC cuts many things have
 had to change. Mr Hope is coping but  
 his income is static.                 </content>
