		<content> I am a member of Hutton Henry Youth   
 Club.It costs 20p for a session.It is 
 held each Tuesday 7pm till 9pm.The    
 people who run the Club are Mr.Wilson 
 and Mr.Truswell.At the Club we play   
 pool,table tennis,football and we can 
 buy sweets In the summer trips are    
 organised.This year we are going to   
 Lightwater Valley.I am also a member  
 of the Badminton Club.The entrance fee
 is 30p and it is organised by each    
 Friday evening Mr.Hilton and          
 Mr.Armstong.You do not need your own  
 racquet because you can borrow one    
 from the club.On Thursdays I go to the
 disco run by the Church Committee and 
 it costs me 20p.Saturday I go swimming
 with my friends but I have to leave   
 the village and travel to Hartlepool  
 for this. I also like going on cycle  
 rides,playing with my computer and    
 watching television.                  </content>
