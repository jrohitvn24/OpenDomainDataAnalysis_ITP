		<content>The house is part 17th century and part
20th century.                          
The owners must be very rich. The out  
buildings and barns are now being      
turned into a playroom, recreation room
and stores, using Cotswold stone and   
Stonesfield Slate. All new windows and 
doors are made from solid oak. The     
existing house has been updated and now
consists of four bedrooms, four bath-  
rooms, study reception, large lounge,  
dining room, kitchen and entrance hall.
It is completly centrally heated but   
has fire places.                       
The house stands in about 20 acres of  
of land and has a swimming pool and    
tennis court. It cost #300 000 to buy  
and another #300 000 to modernize.     
It is only the weekend cottage of a    
commodity buyer.
