		<title>08  ATTITUDES  IN  LEWES</title>
		<content>      Random surveys show common       
{attitudes}amongst Lewesians. They love
 the varied{historic buildings,}but    
 don't like climbing the{steep streets.
 Some see too much{new building,       
 although Lewes' expansion is now      
 severely restricted. They like and use
 the{community centres}in Landport and 
 Malling, but they'd like Lewes to have
 its own{Sports Hall, all-weather      
{running track and covered heated      
{swimming pool.                        
      They value the character of{Lewes
{pubs}(only half the number of l886!)  
 but would like to have a{cinema.}They 
 use the{library}but are horrified at  
 the threat of closure to the Music    
 Library. They are determined to see   
{Lewes Victoria Hospital}stay open.    
 They return a Conservative MP, Liberal
 County Councillors, and Conservative, 
 Liberal and Independent District Cllrs</content>
