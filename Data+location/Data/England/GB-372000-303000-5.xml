		<title>05KEMBERTON VILLAGE AMENITIES</title>
		<content>  Apart from the village hall and      
 public house there are few amenities. 
 There is a small post office but the  
 only shop in the village closed last  
 year. There is a daily milk delivery  
 and a mobile shop comes once a week.  
 Most people do their shopping in      
 Telford Town Centre or ar Madeley,    
 Shifnal or Bridgnorth. A shoppers' bus
 runs to Bridgnorth on Wednesdays and  
 Saturdays and to Telford Town Centre  
 on Tuesdays. The village does not have
 a doctor and most people go to Shifnal
 or Madeley for medical treatment. The 
 village school closed 21 years ago.   
 Primary school children usually go to 
 Beckbury or Shifnal. The secondary    
 school for the village is also at     
 Shifnal. Buses are provided for       
 children who go to these schools. The 
 village has a mobile library and there
 is a newspaper delivery each evening. </content>
