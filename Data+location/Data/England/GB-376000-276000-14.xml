		<title>14Wyre Forest - Leisure</title>
		<content>     The Wyre Forest is used by many   
 people with varying interests. Walking
 is the most popular, either in family 
 groups, exercising dogs, or large     
 rambling clubs of up to 200. Maps and 
 leaflets are available from a         
 Visitors' Centre, and bridle paths are
 clearly defined for horse riding.     
    Car parks and picnic areas are     
 provided, though camping and lighting 
 fires are strictly forbidden.         
    School parties visit the forest to 
 learn about the flora and fauna.      
 Ornithologists and entomologists study
 their subjects and orienteers can     
 often be seen at weekends.            
    When not being used for car rallies
 or large-scale sponsored walks the    
 forest is a haven of peace and        
 tranquillity, and part of a beautiful 
 landscape, on the edge of the densely 
 populated West Midlands.              </content>
