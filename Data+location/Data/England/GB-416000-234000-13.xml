		<content>           We went down to the vicarage
 to interview Mr. Sluman the vicar.    
 Mr. Sluman felt that he had a  call   
 from God that said that God  wanted   
 him to be a vicar.                    
       Before Mr.Sluman came to        
 Blockley he lived at Churchdown.He    
 wanted a change from Churchdown so he 
 went to see the Bishop and asked if   
 he could have a change.So the Bishop  
 agreed and said that he could come to 
 Blockley.                             
        Mr.Sluman said that there were 
 no advantages and no disadvantages    
 about being a vicar in Blockley.      
         There  is an advantage being a
 vicar because you don't have to travel
 to get to work.                       
         The services are on Sunday at 
 8.00, 9.30, 11.00 and 3.00.And there  
 is a service on Wednesday  at         
 10.30.                                </content>
