		<title>01GENERAL VIEW OF WALSALL</title>
		<content> This block covers the town centre     
 and some of the more outlying areas of
{WALSALL}a market town on the northern 
 edge of the industrial{West Midlands. 
{Rushall}in this block was mentioned in
 the{Domesday Book}but Walsall although
 it certainly existed was missed. The  
 town centre is now to the north of{St 
{Matthews Church}but the old town was  
 grouped closely around the{church on  
{the hill}that still dominates Walsall.
{The Arboretum,}with its lakes in the  
 collapsed limestone workings, is one  
 of the well known features of the     
 town. Another is its{12th Century     
 open air{street market.}Walsall is    
 also famous for its{leather trade}and 
 perhaps doesn't justify its present   
 reputation for being one of the most  
 unhealthy places in Britain.
