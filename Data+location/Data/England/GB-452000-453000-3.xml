		<title>03Upper Poppleton village</title>
		<content>   Upper Poppleton is half of a village
 two or three miles North-West of the  
 city of{York.} Together with{Nether   
{Poppleton}it forms a pleasant English 
 village with most of the standard     
 features: a village green, two        
 churches, several farms, shops, pubs, 
 other services and a thriving         
 community life.                       
   There has been extensive housing    
 development in Poppleton and this is  
 still in progress.  As a result, the  
 village is now primarily a dormitory  
 community for people working in the   
 area.                                 
   Typical of many UK villages,        
 Poppleton has its amateur drama group,
{The Poppleton Players}who attract     
 capacity audiences into a local church
 hall for their regular performances.
