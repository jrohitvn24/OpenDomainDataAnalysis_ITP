		<title>09Attitudes of Wilton People</title>
		<content>   The majority of people living and   
 working in Wilton appear to be very   
 contented. They like the atmosphere   
 and friendliness of the town. Most of 
 their needs are catered for , with    
 first and middle schools, churches for
 different religious beliefs and local 
 industries. The main criticism is that
 there are not enough shops.           
   The children in Wilton largely      
 attend the local schools and although 
 they like the town they would like to 
 see changes. More shops and more      
 facilities for leisure would greatly  
 improve the town in their opinion.    
   The overall impression given is that
 people who live in Wilton are very    
 contented with their town and         
 surroundings.
