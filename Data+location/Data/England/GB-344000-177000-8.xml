		<content>  If you  go on the  rocks  you  can   
  see  Portbury  dock.  There are big  
  ships  and  some  cranes  and  you   
  can  see  a factory  in the distance.
  This  man we  interviewed said  he   
  had lived  here since  he  was  born 
  and he does not  like  it; he  said  
  the old power  station  is  going    
  to be knocked  down  for factories   
  and his house  was. There used to be 
  a  railway  station.  He  showed  us 
  were it went in his garden.
