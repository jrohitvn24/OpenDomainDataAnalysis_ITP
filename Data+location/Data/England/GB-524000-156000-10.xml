		<content>  The area in which we live is called  
 Burgh Heath. It gives its name to a   
 group of houses on the busy A 217     
 which is a main road from London to   
 the South Coast. The road cuts the    
 village into two parts and there is   
 another busy road which turns off to  
 Epsom which cuts the village into a   
 further two parts.                    
  Despite the roads the area is quite  
 quiet, thanks to the massive heath.   
 There is a green where children can   
 play football or any other games.     
 There are rows of modern houses all   
 connected together to form a block, as
 well as some much older houses. I have
 lived there all my life. My family has
 two Datsun cars, which are Japanese.
