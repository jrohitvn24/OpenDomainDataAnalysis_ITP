		<title>07ARRETON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>     Arreton Village lies at the base  
 of the south slope of Arreton Down,   
 about 4 miles from Newport, consisting
 mainly of the old village near by the 
 Church of St. George and a straggling 
 line of houses and cottages on the    
 main Newport _ Sandown road, known as 
 Arreton Street.  Several of these     
 older buildings are very interesting  
 to the lover of the old and           
 picturesque, particularly Stile House 
 lying to the west of the church.      
 Stile House was built in the early    
 17th century, on the site of an       
 earlier building and was formerly used
 for brewing the church ales.This      
 building is now called the Red Lion.  
                                       
     The White Lion Inn lies to the    
 south of the church in Arreton Street.
  It is probably 17th century, much    
 altered, but was once a coaching inn. </content>
