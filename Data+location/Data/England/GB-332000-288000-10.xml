		<title>10COMPUTER AT WORK</title>
		<content> The saw was built in Sweden,and is    
 controlled by a{computer.}It is the   
 only one of its kind in Britain .     
                                       
 The saw is held up by pillars over a  
 large pit.The saw has four blades.    
 When the log comes in it has to be    
 scanned so the{computer}knows the     
 size.The chipper takes off the rough  
 sides before it is cut.The log has to 
 go through the saw four times before  
 it is completed.Then it goes out to be
 loaded.                               
                                       
 In a dust free cabin which looks at   
 the saw there is a chair with         
 buttons on the arms to control the    
 machinery.It takes one man to operate 
 the{computer.}In the shed there are   
 eight people when there used to be    
 twenty.It does more work than all the 
 other saws in the yard.               </content>
