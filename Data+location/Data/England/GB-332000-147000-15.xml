		<title>15THE WHITE COTTAGE RESTURAUNT</title>
		<content>                                       
   THE WHITE COTTAGE RESTURAUNT WAS    
BUILT IN THE 16th CENTURY.THE OWNER OF 
THE WHITE COTTAGE HAS LIVED THERE FOR  
FOUR MONTHS SO SHE CAN'T JUDGE THE     
BUSINESS TOO WELL YET.HOWEVER,SHE DOES 
KNOW THAT THINGS ARE PICKING UP        
RAPIDLY.SHE HAS ABOUT THREE MEMBERS OF 
STAFF CONSISTING OF ONE FULL TIME AND  
ONE OR TWO PART TIME.THE RESTURAUNT    
HAS HAD A GOOD REPUTATION FOR A NUMBER 
OF YEARS.THE MENU IS VARIED WITH A     
WIDE CHOICE IN ALL COURSES.THE MEALS   
ARE WELL PRESENTED ALTHOUGH SOME       
DISHES ARE A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT THEN 
AGAIN YOU GET VALUE FOR MONEY.         
BEING ON THE MAIN A38 ALOT OF TRADE    
COMES FROM PASSING TRAFFIC.THEREFORE   
SUMMER TRADE IS USUALLY BUSY.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
