		<content>   In 1985 you can get injections to   
 protect you from many of the commonist
 childrens illnesses; there are        
 injections against polio, whooping    
 cough, diptheria, chicken pox and     
 measles. Also girls have a Rubella    
 injection so that if later on they    
 become pregnant they can't catch      
 German Measles which could make the   
 baby handicapped.                     
   Round about 1965 they started doing 
 heart transplants. After a transplant 
 one man lived for eight years. They   
 are now trying the transplantation of 
 heart and lungs. Recently a baby died 
 after a heart-lung transplant.        
   Another common illness of the 20th  
 century is cancer, which is cuurently 
 under research with the hope that  a  
 cure will be found.
