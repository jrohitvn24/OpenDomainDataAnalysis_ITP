		<title>16A JUNIOR SCHOOLTEACHER'S DAY</title>
		<content> At 6.30 I make breakfast then begin   
 the 13 mile motorbike journey to      
 school which takes 20 minutes. At 8.30
 I prepare work for the first lesson on
 the blackboard, review part of a      
 computer program, register my class   
 and take them to assembly. Maths      
 occupies us until 10.40 then I have a 
 cup of coffee while the children have 
 playtime. Today we are rehearsing our 
 short play called "The Clown who lost 
 his Smile" in which everyone in the   
 class has a part. My next job is to   
 supervise school dinner and in the    
 afternoon the class of 15 special need
 children take part in the Domesday    
 Survey, checking the amenities and    
 talking to local people. At 3.15      
 school finishes but I still have some 
 books to mark. In the evening I       
 instruct sub aqua diving for the youth
 club. A welcome "pint" ends the day.  </content>
