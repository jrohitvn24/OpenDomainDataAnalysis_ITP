		<title>04ORGANIC FARMING</title>
		<content>{The Milnes-Coates were determined to  
{'keep the balance of nature right', as
{Lady Patricia puts it, on their farm. 
{No artificial fertilizers or chemicals
{were used on the land.Any difficulties
{they came across would be met by      
{either pulling up that particular crop
{or fertilizing with manure.           
{  However since her husband died Lady 
{Patricia has handed the running of the
{farm and the estate over to an agent, 
{who is unusually a lady.In an effort  
{to make the farm more profitable, the 
{business of working the farm is now   
{the responsibility of a tenant farmer 
{who uses modern, non-organic methods. 
{ In terms of livestock the farm has a 
{small herd of bullocks.These are put  
{to the slaughter regularly.           
{  Why Moorhouse Farm? In addition     
{to being in a very low-lying area the 
{house was once in the midst of swamps.</content>
