		<title>17Housing - South Wendron</title>
		<content>      We have no large areas of        
 settlement in our area - the largest  
 is the hamlet of Seworgan, which is   
 not even big enough to show up in our 
 Land Cover Survey.  This hamlet is a  
 mixture of quite old farms with newer 
 houses and bungalows built between    
 them.  Planners call this "Infilling".
  There is also a thriving Methodist   
 Chapel.                               
      In the rest of the area the      
 housing consists mainly of isolated   
 farms and farm cottages, with a few   
 newer buildings dotted here and there.
  Several of the older cottages, which 
 were used by farm labourers or miners 
 years ago, have been bought privately 
 and modernised.  Some smallholdings   
 have had their buildings sold and     
 their fields let to neighbouring      
 larger farms.
