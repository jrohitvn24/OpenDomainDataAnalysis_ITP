       A large number of people, both  
 young and old, enjoy a wide range of  
 outdoor activities like walking,      
 cycling, birdwatching and camping.    
       Gardening and reading are very  
 popular with adults.                  
       The public houses in the three  
 villages are very important centres   
 for adult recreation.                 
       The sports field at Nawton is   
 very well used by children and adults.
 It has one tennis court which is very 
 well used. Nawton has football and    
 cricket teams which play in the local 
 leagues.
