		<content>  When we arrive at school we play in  
 the playground until bell.We go inside
 and take off our coats.Then we file   
 into class to pick up our hymn books  
 and then go into assembly.There we    
 sing hymns and sometimes a class      
 performs a play.Then we come back into
 class for register.There are 37       
 children in our class.We read first   
 and then we do some Maths or English. 
  At playtime we go outside and play   
 for a quarter of an hour.There are    
 also crisps to buy if we are hungry.  
  After break we go back into the      
 classroom and do some more work.      
 Usually we do some Maths or English   
 again.There is now one and a quarter  
 hours until dinner.                   
  When the dinner bell goes we put our 
 books away and go outside.
