		<title>17Sea defences Sheerness</title>
		<content>   There have been four types of{sea   
{defence,}the present wall being       
 completed in November 1983. The       
 original wall was the Shingle Bank    
 built to a height of 3.5 metres. As it
 was low there was a risk of{flooding  
 and the second wall, called the       
 Promenade was built about 4.6 metres  
 in height.                            
   The third sea wall called the       
 Garages was built in 1933 and provided
 garages for local residents and a{ sea
 wall at a height of 6.1 metres. This  
 wall also proved ineffective as in    
 1953 severe flooding occured in most  
 of Sheerness.                         
   The fourth and safest wall has been 
 constructed to a height of 7.25 metres
 and is curved so that the water       
 rebounds.This design has made it a    
 feature of the{landscape.
