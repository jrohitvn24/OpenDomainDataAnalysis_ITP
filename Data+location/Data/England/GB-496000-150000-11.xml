		<content>    My name is Vicky and I am twelve   
 years old. I enjoy attending dancing  
 lessons and playing outside with my   
 friends. But I especially enjoy       
 visiting the theatre and reading. My  
 five year old brother enjoys playing  
 with his friends, his toy cars, or    
 listening to records, tapes or        
 stories. He also loves outdoor        
 activities like swimming or tennis.   
    My Dad enjoys playing Bridge,      
 working on his car, reading and taking
 the dog for a walk to the pub. Mum    
 enjoys an undisturbed read when all   
 her house work is done, or visiting   
 the theatre.                          
    As a family we enjoy walks in the  
 countryside with our dog, or playing  
 swingball in our garden. We also enjoy
 visiting our relatives and just being 
 together, especially at Christmas and 
 holiday times.                        </content>
