		<content> ....to be made into sugar. Most of the
 straw gets burnt but some is given    
 away and some is kept. There is one   
 regular man who works on the farm with
 Mr Graves. Propogation for future     
 crops is done mainly using seed       
 produced in previous years but        
 sometimes new seed is bought in to    
 strengthen the crop.                  
      Altogether he has got{700        
{chickens}that lay approximately{200   
{eggs every day.}All the eggs are sold 
 to private customers. They have got   
 one egg sorting machine which sorts   
 the eggs into sizes. None of the eggs 
 are fertilized and therefore do not   
 hatch, as it is more economical to buy
 in chicks when they are required.
