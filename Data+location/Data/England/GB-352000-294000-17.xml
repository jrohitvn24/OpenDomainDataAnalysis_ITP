		<title>17CONSERVATIVES IN PLAISH</title>
		<content>    One aim of this 19 member committee
 in Cardington &amp; Plaish is to help to  
 return Conservative members at local, 
 national and European elections. We   
 canvass,that is each has a section of 
 the parish community to visit, making 
 sure that voters know the name of the 
 Conservative candidate, the date and  
 place of their polling station,and    
 that they have transport if they are  
 believed to be supporters.            
    The other aim is to raise money to 
 keep the Conservative Office in       
 Shrewsbury in good repair structurally
 and to help to pay the salary of an   
 agent or secretary.Also money is sent 
 to the Central Conservative office at 
 Westminster. We raise this money by   
 organising social events,such as      
 Cheese &amp; Wine evenings, a Barbecue and
 Swimming Party,and Coffee Evenings.
