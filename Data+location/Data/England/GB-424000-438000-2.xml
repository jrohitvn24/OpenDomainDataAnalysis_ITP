		<content> As part of the project we have to     
 investigate a topic of special        
 interest in our area.We decided to    
 look closely at the industrial estate 
 just north of the ring road.We wanted 
 to know just how many companies and   
 businesses were there,what each did   
 and how many people were employed.So  
 we devised a questionnaire and visited
 every company.The questionnare        
 basically tried to outline what the   
 company does,how many people it       
 employs and how long it has been in   
 its location but in some cases various
 other matters were considered.Here are
 some samples of the questions we      
 asked:-                               
 1.Do you produce anything?            
 2.How many employees are there?       
 3.How long have you been here?        
 4.What was the building used for      
 before?                               </content>
