		<content> The block is largely rural and is     
 traversed from north to south by the  
{River Hart.}In general terms about a  
 quarter of the block is wooded, just  
 over half is farmland and the         
 remainder consists of routeways and   
 residential areas. From east to west  
 the block is traversed by the{M3      
{motorway}and the{London to Southampton
{Railway.}To the south of the block is 
 a 2 km section of the recently        
 restored{Basingstoke Canal}so in just 
 twelve square kilometres we have      
 examples from three transport         
 revolutions. Although the block verges
 on the suburbs of the commuter town of
{Fleet}its residential areas are       
 nearly all tiny hamlets, namely       
{Winchfield}and{Winchfield Hurst}and   
 parts of{Phoenix Green, Chatter Alley,
{Bagwell Green, Rotten Green}and       
{Elvetham.                             </content>
