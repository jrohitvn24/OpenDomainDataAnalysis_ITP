		<title>03An Interview with Jessie</title>
		<content>{Mrs. Jessie Haley}kindly let us       
 interview her in her{fashion shop}at  
{Howden-le-Wear.}She started her first 
 shop in 1954 at Howden-le-Wear selling
 small things such as wool, aprons etc.
 Today in 1985 she has three very      
 modern fashion shops,in Crook,Bishop  
 Auckland and Howden-le-Wear.The things
 that she sells now are up to the      
 minute fashion and accessories.She    
 selects all the fashions herself and  
 only sells the things she likes.She   
 tries to employ smart,helpful and     
 intelligent people aged between 25 and
 40.The{prices}range from{80p}for a    
 necklace to{Â£148}for a dress.She sells
 the same things in all of her shops   
 to make buying easier.A credit card   
 system is in use at her shops.        
 Unfortunatley she is retiring in 1987 
 and is selling {all}of her shops.
