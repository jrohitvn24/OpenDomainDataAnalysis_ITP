		<title>01PART OF WAREHAM FOREST</title>
		<content> To the south-east of the block is the 
 RAC Tank Training Range attached to   
 Bovington Camp.  The terrain is mainly
 heathland with large open spaces of   
 sandy soil.  The whole area is bery   
 isolated with very few inhabitants.   
 In the north-east sector there is a   
 trout farm where fish are artificially
 reared for the table.  The remainder  
 of the area is mainly covered by pine 
 forest form which are cut large       
 quantities of pit props.  Around these
 woodlands are smaller areas of        
 deciduous trees - mainly oak and      
 beech.  There is a Wessex Water       
 Authority reservoir in the north of   
 the block which provides water for the
 Winfrith Atomic Energy Establishment. 
 Clouds Hill Cottage, which belonged to
 "Lawrence of Arabia" is now owned by  
 the National Trust and can be found in
 the southern part of this block.      </content>
