 The older schools in the area were    
 church schools. Later the W.R.C.C     
 built several schools. After 1944 the 
 education was in Infant, Junior, Sec- 
 ondary Modern and Grammar Schools.    
 In 1972 reorganisation took place and 
 9 First (5-9), 3 Middle (9-13) and 1  
 Comprehensive School (13-18) were     
 established. Following a decrease in  
 the birth rate in the 1970s 2 First   
 Schools were closed.Today all First   
 and Middle Schools have smaller rolls 
 and one wonders if with the continuing
 drop in numbers and some parents      
 wishing older children to go to Sixth 
 Form Colleges whether further closures
 or reorganisation could be imminent.  
 People in the area attend F.E. classes
 at Mirfield,Dewsbury &amp; Batley         
 Technical &amp; Art College &amp; Huddersfield
 Technical College &amp; Polytechnic.      </content>
