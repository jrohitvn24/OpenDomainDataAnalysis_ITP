NEAR TO OUR SCHOOL THERE IS THE LOCAL  
AMBULANCE STATION.,  MR.AMOS, THE MAN  
IN CHARGE OF THE STATION, CAME INTO    
SCHOOL AND TOLD US ABOUT A DAY AT THE  
STATION.                               
THEY GET A LOT OF EMERGENCIES EVERY    
DAY.THE MOST COMMON BEING CAR ACCIDENTS
AND ACCIDENTS INVOLVING PEOPLE TRIPPING
AND FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS. SOMETIMES 
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT TO THE ROACHES     
(AN OUTCROP OF ROCK JUST OUTSIDE LEEK) 
TO ATTEND TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE HURT      
THEMSELVES FALLING FROM THE ROCKS. IF  
IT IS WINTER THE CLIMBERS ARE          
SOMETIMES SUFFERING FROM HYPOTHERMIA.  
THEY ALSO TAKE PEOPLE TO HOSPITAL IF   
THEY CANNOT GET THERE THEMSELVES.      
USUALLY IT IS THE ELDERLEY WHO ARE     
TAKEN. MR.AMOS IS VERY HAPPY BEING AN  
AMBULANCE MAN. HE SAYS HE GETS A GREAT 
DEAL OF SATISFACTION FROM HIS JOB.     </content>
