		<content> In this area there is no real poverty.
 The majority of pensioners are past   
 employees of the Duchy of Cornwall and
 live in Duchy cottages near to        
 families.Property owners are mostly   
 here because of existing ties.There   
 are Council houses at Venterdon for   
 the slightly infirm or aged with an   
 attendant warden.The people's own good
 health and a caring communityhas, so  
 far, prevented too many problems in   
 spite of the fact that Health         
 facilities are 5 miles away.However,  
 great concern is being expresed at the
 number of young people departing to   
 nearby towns through lack of          
 employment,and that some newcomers are
 taking little part in the community,  
 their interests lying elsewhere.      
 Increased traffic causes problems and 
 public opinion has caused a students' 
 hostel to be resited.                 </content>
