   This is what we found out. The      
church is fifty years old and the      
present minister has been here for five
years. He takes three services a week. 
Before the church was built the        
Methodists met in a small building near
Pickmoss Lane. The Minister is retiring
shortly to live in Hindhead, Surrey.   
   Priests wear white collars as a kind
of uniform. In the church they have    
used two different types of hymn books 
since 1932. On average sixty people    
come to each of his services. They have
thirty-seven bibles in the church and  
sixteen people sing in the choir. While
he has been here he has baptised       
sixteen children and married fourteen  
couples. The land owned by the church  
used to be farmland.
