		<title>18The Weekend in Rowan's Home</title>
		<content>    My name is Rowan Boys and at       
 weekends our family tries to do as    
 much as it can.                       
    Sometimes, my brother, who has left
 school, rides his motor bike back to  
 the old farm where we used to live. My
 other brother, who has also left      
 school, goes to work in the local pub,
 The Town Crier.                       
    If the weather is fine, Mum, Dad,  
 my sister and I, go to a nearby       
 nursery to get some plants for our    
 garden.                               
    On Sunday mornings we sometimes go 
 to church, then my sister and I are   
 allowed to play out. Then at tea-time,
 my sister and I, go to our friend     
 Angela's house. We watch films on     
 their video and play some games on    
 their computer. We stay out usually   
 till 9.30p.m., but we have been out as
 late as 10.30p.m.                     </content>
