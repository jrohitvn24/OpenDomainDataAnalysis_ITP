		<title>02Police Service in Clun Area</title>
		<content>  There is one police constable in     
 Clun. His name is Trevor Anthony Balch
 and his age is 23 .The area he covers 
 is about 400 square miles which he    
 said was the largest beat in the      
 country. There have been about 125    
 reported crimes in our block in the   
 last year. Most of these were at      
 farms which have had machinery and    
 (rarely) cattle stolen. About 75% of  
 these crimes have been solved. P.C.   
 Balch has had to learn about farming. 
 He likes Clun rather than a larger    
 town because he is the only policeman 
 and can do a whole enquiry by himself.
 Previously he worked at Ludlow and on 
 the Clee hills.                       
  This is the order of P.C. Balches    
 shifts: 7 days on, 3 days off; 8      
 days on, 3 days off.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
