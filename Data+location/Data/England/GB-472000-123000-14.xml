		<title>14BEDALES SCHOOL, PETERSFIELD</title>
		<content> Bedales school was started by J.H.    
 Badly, who was the first Headmaster.  
 It opened in January 1893 at a country
 house called "Bedales" near Haywards  
 Heath in Sussex. In 1900 the school   
 moved to Steep. Later the first and   
 middle schools, Dunannie and Dunhurst,
 were opened. Bedales has been widely  
 accepted as both a pioneer and leader 
 in 'progressive education'. The       
 curriculum is based on the idea of    
 'education for life'. Bedales is a co-
 educational school with about 390     
 boarders and 175 children who go      
 daily.                                
 The Arts play an important part in the
 life of the school and it has a high  
 reputation for music, drama and art   
 and craft. There are good facilities  
 for sport and science, and a fine     
 library.
