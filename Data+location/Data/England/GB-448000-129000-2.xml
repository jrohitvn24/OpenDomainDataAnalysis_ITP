		<title>02The Hampshire Chronicle</title>
		<content> "The Hampshire Chronicle" has been    
 going for 213 years.This weekly paper 
 serves the Winchester area with a     
 circulation of about 24,000 .It is a  
 family owned paper.They use "Hot Metal
 Linotype" machines to make type.This  
 is produced by casting a line which is
 typed in on a keyboard.They recycle   
 the metal and use it again and again .
 Pages are put together in the chase , 
 they push all the type together to    
 make a page on the stone and flatten  
 it with a mallet.Then it is corrected 
 in the readers room but it is hard    
 because they have to read it back to  
 front.The large printing machines can 
 print up to 3500 papers per hour , 4  
 pages both sides at a time.The 5.1/2  
 mile long rolls of newsprint are cut  
 and folded by the machine.The size of 
 paper depends on the advertisements.No
 one wants "The Chronicle" to change.  </content>
