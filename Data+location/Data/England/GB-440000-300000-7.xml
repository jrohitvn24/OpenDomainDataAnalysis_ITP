		<content> The village itself covers an area of  
 approx. 0.15 sq.km. and is surrounded 
 by land devoted to agricultural usage.
 The majority of the 150 or so         
 residents are not however reliant upon
 farming for their income and generally
 commute daily to their place of       
 employment.                           
                                       
 The village has no shops but does     
 possess a Post Office, a coffee house 
 and two public houses, the Greyhound  
 Inn and the Hercules Inn. Bed and     
 breakfast facilities are also         
 available for tourists to the area.   
                                       
 Sutton Cheney is serviced each week by
 a mobile greengrocer, and fishmonger  
 and also the mobile library.          
 The only bus service available is to
