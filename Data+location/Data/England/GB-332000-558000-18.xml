		<content>{   The Beaumont Bogle}: a white horse 
 is believed to haunt the bridge at the
 bottom of Beaumont Hill.              
    Two people have reported{ghosts}in 
 their homes. A Roman Legionary marches
 through a bungalow at Monkhill opening
 doors ; and at the old Rectory, when a
 bell was rung in the Kitchen the study
 door was opened.                      
    A{school treat}in the form of an   
 outing and a Christmas party is       
 organised by a committee every year.  
    A{Palm Sunday procession}was held  
 this year led by a donkey through     
 Beaumont village to the Church.       
    Each year a{Marsh Committee}meets  
 at Sandsfield to arrange for the      
 letting of the Marsh Stints (fields)  
 and a dinner is held. Salmon is often 
 served.
