		<content>I go to a church called Briercliff     
Christian Fellowship. It is fairly     
small,with about 90 people.When it     
comes to the sermon all the children go
to sunday school.At sunday school we   
learn songs and the person who is      
doing it talks to us about God.The     
children under the age of 8 go to      
another class and they make            
things.I've been going to church for 9 
years and I've been a Christian for 6  
years.You have a better and longer life
being a Christian.                     
                                       
I go to Holy Trinty Church on the      
first week of the new month.Just       
before the service starts the          
cubs,brownies and guides take up 4     
flags.At the end of the service        
everybody stands up and they take the  
flags down the isle then everybody     
walks over to the refreshments.        </content>
