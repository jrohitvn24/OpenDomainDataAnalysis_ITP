		<content> Mr Savage's policy has been forced on 
 him because of the{poor land.}Some    
 fields are water meadows with a peat  
 soil but most of the land is{acid soil
 on top of sand and gravel. The soil is
 treated with{lime}every three years.He
 produces{grazing land}for cattle and  
 grass for{hay.}Fourty five{bulls}are  
 kept in one field.The best age to buy 
 cattle is{two years.}Mr Savage buys   
 in the autumn, keeps them through the 
 winter and sells them in early spring.
 The amount of hay produced governs how
 many bulls are bought. Because of the 
 well drained soil buildings are not   
 expensive. The{buildings}are lean-to's
 which are corrigated iron roofs on top
 of chestnut posts.This construction   
 allows air to circulate round the     
{machinery}keeping it dry. He also has 
 a barn for{hay.}The animals are kept  
 as near to nature as possible.        </content>
