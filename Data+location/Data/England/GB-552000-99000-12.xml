		<title>12Friston Forest Nature Trail</title>
		<content> On a warm damp July morning we set out
 to survey our allotted part of Friston
 Forest;we parked in one of the car    
 parks of the Forestry Commision. Our  
 path led us to a ridge overlooking    
 Charleston Bottom-a sharp contrast    
 between agricultural fields on the one
 hand and forest on the other.Despite  
 the fact that it was July and holiday 
 time,we saw only one other walker;it  
 seems few people venture far from     
 their cars,except long distance       
 walkers using the South Downs Way,    
 which crosses the forest.We met a     
 Parisian family who had been touring  
 Great Britain during the previous     
 fortnight;they had parked their       
 dormobile overnight in the carpark to 
 enjoy the peace and quiet of the      
 forest.We explained,in French,what we 
 were doing,and they told us,in English
 a little about themselves.            </content>
