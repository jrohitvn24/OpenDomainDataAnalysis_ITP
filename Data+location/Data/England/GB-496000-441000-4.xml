		<content> The Sports' Field Pavilion,opened in  
 June 1985,is where the Sports' Field  
 Management Committee and sporting     
 clubs,using the field,meet.There is a 
 strong cricket club, a well supported 
 football club and a tennis club with  
 teams playing in the Driffield        
 leagues.The pavilion is a joint       
 venture with the Baden-Powell         
 organisations in the village and the  
 Scouts/Cubs meetings are moving from  
 the Village Hall to the Pavilion.The  
 Guides and Brownies are expected to   
 follow. The Village Green.What Green? 
 Where?The open space next to the Post 
 Office. Unlike other greens it is     
 fenced, but children do kick a ball   
 there and play informal cricket on a  
 summer's evening,and older lads sit on
 benches and fences.The shop and       
 Post Office are also important social 
 meeting places.                       </content>
