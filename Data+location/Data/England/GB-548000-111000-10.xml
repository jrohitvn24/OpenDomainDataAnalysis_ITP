		<title>10LAUGHTON PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Laughton County Primary School was    
 completed in 1872. It now has 79      
 pupils in three classes. Teaching in  
 the top class is shared by the        
 headmaster and a part-time teacher.   
 Children attending come from Laughton,
 Ripe, Chalvington, Ringmer, Selmeston 
 and Glynde. All the children stay at  
 lunch time: some bring sandwiches,    
 about half eat school dinners, which  
 are cooked in the school's kitchen.   
 Every day the postman calls (even if  
 we have no mail) because the cook     
 always has a cup of tea ready!        
 The school has its own swimming pool, 
 good playground space and uses the    
 adjoining recreation ground. A video  
 recorder has just been delivered and  
 shortly we will have a photocopier and
 a disk drive. The old school house was
 converted this year into an office,   
 with extra teaching and storage space.</content>
