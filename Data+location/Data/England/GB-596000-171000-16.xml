		<title>16Shurland Ghosts - Eastchurch</title>
		<content>   Shurland Hall today is in a poor    
 state of repair and although it has a 
{preservation}order on it little has   
 been done to preserve it. Three years 
 ago the villagers of Eastchurch tried,
 unsuccessfully to make it into a      
{museum.                               
   A feature of the Hall which still   
 remains is that it is{haunted.}In an  
 extract from a letter written by an   
 unnamed Victorian lady were           
 descriptions of mysterious bells,     
 barking dogs and of a lady in black   
 appearing in the Hall at midnight.    
 Other{supernatural}happenings involved
 infestations of spiders foretelling   
 death and weird noises. An entry from 
 a parish register in 1769 told of     
 Grace David drowning herself in the   
 Old House Pond suggesting the source  
 of the hauntings.                     
                                       </content>
