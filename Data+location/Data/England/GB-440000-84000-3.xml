		<content>{     WESTOVER,}originally the Manor   
 house, is on the site of an earlier   
 dwelling. It dates from the 18th      
 century and is built in Regency style.
 It is now owned by a doctor and his   
 family. Many of the outbuildings and  
 former staff cottages are used as     
 self-catering holiday accommodation.  
      The former{RECTORY,}basically a  
 Tudor building with some later        
 additions, was sold early in the l980s
 and is now part private home and part 
 let as en suite bedrooms to holiday   
 guests.                               
      The{CHURCH,}dedicated to{ALL     
{SAINTS,}was begun in Norman times, but
 is now a good example of a thirteenth 
 century church, with the North        
 transept rebuilt in the 19th century  
 as the chapel of the Barrington Simeon
 family. The church is now linked with 
 those of Shalfleet and Newtown.       </content>
