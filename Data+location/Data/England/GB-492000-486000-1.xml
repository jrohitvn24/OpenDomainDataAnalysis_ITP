		<title>01Wykeham forest</title>
		<content> Relatively flat and predominantly     
 coniferous forests in the North York  
 Moors National Park. The forests are  
 in all stages from felled and newly   
 planted areas to mature forest. Most  
 residents live in the small settlement
 of North Moor and are forestry        
 commission workers,although there are 
 few farms. Arable farming is done to  
 the south of the forests, and along   
 Troutsdale in the north west there is 
 some grazing along the valley. Towards
 the north the area drops steeply into 
 Troutsdale long the ridge of          
 Troutsdale Brow. From the top of this 
 Brow (e.g. High wood Brow) there are  
 spectacular views to the north. The   
 area is accessible  to motorists so is
 much visited. The forests are also    
 popular with walkers. As there are no 
 facilities the area is restricted to  
 day trips.                            </content>
