		<content>   KESTEVEN Forest once covered a large
 part of this region, but now it is    
 mostly farmland. There remains approx.
 1 1/2 square kilometres of woodlands  
 including Pillow &lt;Pillar> Wood, Bourne
 Wood, Dobbins Wood and Auster Wood.   
   The trees are a mixture of deciduous
 and conifer; at least twenty three    
 varieties.  Dutch elm disease has     
 destroyed many of the elms. In Bourne 
 Wood coniferous trees planted in the  
 1920s for use as pit props etc. are   
 gradually being replaced by oaks and  
 other deciduous varieties, making the 
 trails through the woods more         
 interesting. The Forestry Commission  
 owns some of the woodlands in this    
 area.
