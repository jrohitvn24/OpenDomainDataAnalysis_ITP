		<title>16TOURISM IN EAST COKER</title>
		<content>  From a{tourists}point of view it's a 
 very{peaceful area with a sleepy      
{atmosphere.}In parts it is very       
 isolated.                             
  The scenery  here is beautiful and   
 there are many{leafy,winding lanes.}In
 one part there's also a reservoir that
 has a{picnic spot}in which tourists   
 may enjoy a peaceful lunch with a     
 beautiful view over the water.A       
 pleasant area for waalking and        
 relaxing.                             
  For those with special interests     
 there are many{buildings of historic  
{interest,}described on pages 17 and   
 18. Especially worth seeing are the   
 churches at Sutton Bingham and East   
 Coker.                                
  It pays to get out and{walk through  
{the villages}to absorb the atmosphere 
 and enjoy the cottages and their      
 gardens at close quarters.            </content>
