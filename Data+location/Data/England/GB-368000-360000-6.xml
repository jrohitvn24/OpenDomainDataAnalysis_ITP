		<content>{Church Farm}consists of 367 acres of p
 asture land.The bulk of the acreage is
 close to the farm.However,following th
 e modern trend a number of fields are 
 several miles away.It is a good exampl
 e of a well run modern farm.The centra
 l feature is the {computer controlled 
{milking parlour}which was installed in
 1983 at a cost of Â£50,000.The pedigree
 herd of Friesian cows is housed during
 winter in an{open plan shippon.}In add
 ition there are several buildings for 
 housing young stock.Other buildings in
 clude 3 hay barns,some buildings for s
 toring farm vehicles and machinery.The
 re are 3 large{silage pits}and an unde
 rground {slurry pit.}Slurry is a perpe
 tual problem.For example,the trout fis
 hery on the farm was ruined by slurry 
 pollution.Such pollution is a problem 
 for the fisheries on all the local    
 flashes.                              </content>
