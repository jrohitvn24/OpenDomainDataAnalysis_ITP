		<title>08DAIRY HERD II.</title>
		<content>    The milk is piped to a filter which
 removes hairs and straw,etc.,then to a
 cooler before passing into a Stainless
 Steel vat which can hold 4000 gallons.
 Tankers from the Dairy collect the    
 milk daily.After each milking,the cows
 udder is sprayed with insect repellent
 to prevent infection from flies.      
    The Dairyman also breeds and rears 
 his own stock.Day old calves are taken
 from the mother and fed on milk. The  
 calves are weaned onto pellets and    
 then changed onto{Wheat}or{Barley }   
 before being let out to the pastures. 
 Male calves are sold when they are    
 older.The females join the herd.      
    The cow is put back with the herd  
 and a young Hereford bull grazes      
 nearby to make her more receptive to  
{ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION,}and in 9     
 months time,she will,hopefully,bear   
 another calf.                         </content>
