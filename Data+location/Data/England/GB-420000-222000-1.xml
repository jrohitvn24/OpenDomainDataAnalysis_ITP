		<content>{ }The area is very pretty indeed.There
 are no mountains or high hills, but   
 the area is not completely flat.It    
 is gently undulating.There are many   
 walks along footpaths. Icomb is a     
 place for farms.The land is mostly    
 grazing and crops.There are no        
 heavey industries in the area.        
   There are no facilities like        
 doctors,police,firemen or             
 schools.People go to Bledington,a     
 slightly larger local,village,to the  
 primary school,a village shop,post    
 office and the Kings Head,public      
 house. Doctors,firemen, and larger    
 shops are at Stow on the Wold and     
 Chipping Norton.                      
    Icomb is a typically ,pretty       
 Cotswold village  but it has not been 
 discovered yet by tourists and so it  
 is unspoilt.
