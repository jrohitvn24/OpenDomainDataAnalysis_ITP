		<content>  The majority of this area is sparsely
 developed being agricultural land     
 dotted with farms and cottages dating 
 from 15th, 16th and 17th century.     
 Generally these are of timber frame   
 construction (oak) with lath and      
 plaster or, in later examples, brick  
 and flint infill. Roofing is generally
 of clay peg tile or long straw thatch.
 Little Lodge and Great Lodge are      
 important brick built manor houses.   
 There are 19th and 2Oth century houses
 scattered throughout the area,        
 predominantly on the fringes of       
 Shalford and Great Bardfield. The new 
 building particularly in the late 4O's
 and 6O's was of conventional cavity   
 construction of brick and concrete    
 blocks under cement tiled roof.       
 Planning constriction in the last 15  
 years has severly restricted housing  
 development in this rural area.       </content>
