		<content>  On the moors there is a lot of       
 wildlife including otters.            
 A dog otter needs about twelve miles  
 for his territory. They like to eat   
 eels and small fish. They prefer to   
 live away from people. Some farmers   
 would like to change the use they make
 of the land and grow crops on some of 
 the fields which are now used for     
 grazing.                              
 If they did this there might not be   
 anywhere suitable for otters to       
 live. The County Council is trying to 
 avoid this happening. They intend to  
 declare parts of the Somerset Levels  
 sites of scientific interest. This    
 would mean that there would have to be
 discussions between all those         
 interested before any changes were    
 allowed.
