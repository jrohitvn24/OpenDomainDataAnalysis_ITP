       Two of us went to interview the 
matron in the local home. We found out 
there are 36 patients and 21 staff.    
One lady is 100 and a man 91 years old.
Two patients have been in since the    
home began in 1974.                    
       Patients are taken in depending 
on circumstances. Many are not local.  
They would like more visitors in the   
home. Patients are free to get up and  
go to bed when they like;most have th- 
eir own room and a TV. Some have pets  
such as budgies or fish. Some patients 
need help with eating,etc because of   
handicaps. Some old folk remembered    
when there were few houses here.       
      They made us very welcome and    
we were happy to help with the work.
