 The block{04800153}is dominated by the
 town of{Fleet}which has approximately 
 28,000 inhabitants. Fleet is situated 
 in North East Hampshire, 38 miles from
 London. The town has excellent road   
 and rail services.  The surrounding   
 countryside on the grid is made up    
 largely of pine and silver birch woods
 and heather commons. In the N.E. of   
 the town lies{Fleet Pond,}and the     
{Basingstoke Canal}flows throughout the
 grid. The northern area of the grid is
 occupied by woods and farmland.       
 Amongst the pine trees at Pyestock is 
 the{National Gas Turbine Establishment
 and on the other side of the road is  
 part of the{Royal Aircraft            
{Establishment.}Both are places where  
 modern research takes place and they  
 are major employers for the area.
