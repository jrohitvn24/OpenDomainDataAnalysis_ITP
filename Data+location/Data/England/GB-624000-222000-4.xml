		<title>04NAZE MARINE PARK</title>
		<content> The Naze Marine has been a caravan    
 park for 35 years.There are 800       
 caravans and 50 chalets.We asked the  
 staff some questions and found out    
 that 5 people worked full time and 8  
 part time.In the season about 5000    
 people come a day.Nobody lives there  
 all the year round.The 50 chalets are 
 owned by the people in the service.The
 smallest of the caravans are  22 feet 
 long and 4 birth and the biggest are  
 44 feet long and 10 birth.Some of the 
 staff have worked at the camp for 10  
 years.
