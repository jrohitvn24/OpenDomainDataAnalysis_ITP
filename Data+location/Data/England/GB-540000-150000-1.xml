{Hurst Green.}Our area is being        
 surveyed by two schools.              
  The land that surrounds us was once a
 mainly rural area.Now there are       
 several housing estates and more are  
 imminent,but it is still a beautiful  
 area,many commuters live here and     
 there are few people that work in the 
 area.{

 protected by the{National Trust}.
