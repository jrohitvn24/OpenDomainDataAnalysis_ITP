		<content> The sewage from houses in the area    
 goes to septic tanks in people's      
 gardens.                              
 It is treated by being broken down by 
 bacteria.The liquid portion of our    
 sewage drains through the top soil    
 down to Yockleton Brook.Every few     
 years the septic  tanks are emptied   
 and taken away by tanker.             
 Our clean water comes from two bore   
 holes, one at Ford and one at Eyton   
 near Alberbury.It is pumped from a    
 huge sandstone aquafer.It is treated  
 with chlorine and an anti - hardness  
 chemical as it is pumped out of the   
 borehole. The groundwater is of high  
 quality and does not really need to be
 treated.                              
 Before mains water was introduced,    
 people had wells.Mr.Poole,of Yew Tree 
 Farm can remember pumping water and   
 carrying it a long way to the house.  </content>
