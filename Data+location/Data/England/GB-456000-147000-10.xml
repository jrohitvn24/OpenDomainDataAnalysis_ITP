		<title>10East Oakley Village Hall</title>
		<content>{East Oakley Village Hall}was built in 
 1913 by the Manydown Estates as a     
 Workingmen's Club. In 1956, it was    
 given over for general village use.   
 The first hiring was The Good         
 Companions, an old folks group which  
 still meets there today. The hall     
 still provides a valuable service in  
 the village. There are over 35{jumble 
{sales}each year in aid of various     
 village groups. The{Methodist Youth   
{Club}meets there every week and there 
 is a{Bingo Night}almost every Monday  
 in the year.{Whist drives}have        
 recently lost popularity and have     
 been phased out. There are occasional 
 "whole day sales" when commodities    
 such as wool and household items are  
 sold. The hall no longer has a music  
 licence because of its close proximity
 to houses.
