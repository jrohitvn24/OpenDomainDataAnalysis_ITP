		<content> THE GREAT YARMOUTH STADIUM            
   We went to visit Mr. Franklyn, who  
 has been interested in racing         
 greyhounds since 1928. The stadium was
 finally completed by May 1940. The    
 original stadium was where the        
 Heliport is now. The heliport is next 
 door to the New Stadium. Speedway     
 began in 1947, but they couldn't take 
 enough profit to continue. The        
 greyhound track was once grass but is 
 now sand. Sand is better because there
 are less accidents. During firework   
 displays greyhounds are taken to the  
 barn to stop them becoming frightened.
   When Mr. Franklyn used to run       
 greyhounds at the stadium, he made    
 many trips to Ireland because he found
 they were best there.
