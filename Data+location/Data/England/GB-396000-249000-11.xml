		<title>11TYPICAL FARM (2).</title>
		<content>   Hayes Farm extends to 208 acres and 
 is situated on the Fladbury road, one 
 mile from Bishampton. The soil type is
 kuyper marl which is heavy and is also
 prone to drought. The fields vary in  
 size from 6 to 30 acres.              
   The Tarver family have been at the  
 farm since 1964. There are now three  
 dwellings on the farm occupied by     
 members of the family. The main farm  
 buildings are a dairy unit housing 200
 cattle, milking parlour, effluent     
 storage and silage clamps to store    
 winter feed. The whole farm is down   
 to grass except for 30 acres of plums.
 Grass is used for grazing and silage  
 to provide feed for the livestock, a  
 herd of 130 British Friesian dairy    
 cows producing 800,000 litres of milk 
 a year, dairy youngstock and a flock  
 of 100 Suffolk sheep from which       
 breeding rams are sold.               </content>
