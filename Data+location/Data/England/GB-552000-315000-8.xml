 Thursday morning in the Methodist     
 Schoolrooms.There are two paid        
 leaders.The ANTHONY CURTON AIDED      
 SCHOOL opened in September 1983       
 following the closure of CURTONS      
 ENDOWED and WALPOLE ST ANDREW primary 
 schools.The school has 125 pupils and 
 4.5 teachers.There is a school hall   
 which is used by the community as are 
 the classrooms.The field is a         
 triangular shape but the school does  
 have access to the playing field.There
 is a PARENT TEACHERS AND FRIENDS      
 ASSOCIATION which in its first 18     
 months has raised almost Â£2,000.The   
 largest item bought for the school is 
 a B.B.C. computer.
