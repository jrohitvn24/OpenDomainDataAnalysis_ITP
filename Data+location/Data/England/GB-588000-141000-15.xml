		<title>15Smarden Jumble Sales</title>
		<content> Any Saturday afternoon in Smarden cars
 will be streaming into the village    
 hall bringing buyers to a jumble sale.
 A queue usually forms as buyers rush  
 to be first into the hall. Regulars   
 know where the white elephant stall   
 will be, and the first comers run     
 looking for brass, china, old lamps   
 cameras, watches &amp; so on. Old radios, 
 TVs, vacuum cleaners and carpets stand
 near the door. Important or valuable  
 items may be housed on the stage where
 they will be safe. There are stalls   
 for books &amp; toys; clothes, outmoded or
 outgrown; shoes &amp; bags. The produce   
 stall has plants, fruit &amp; vegetables  
 and the home made cake stall always   
 sells out fast. Jumble sales often    
 make about Â£200, an easy way for a    
 group to make money. Thieves too often
 have a good day, pocketing small items
 in the first rush of buyers.          </content>
