		<content> A small dairy farm. The{dairy farmer  
 has been on this farm for 18 years    
 although he has farmed in the area for
 35 years altogether. His farm is      
 aproximately 106 acres and is one of  
 the largest farms in the area. He     
 produces{37,000}litres of milk per    
 month from a herd of 150{Fresian cows.
 He sells his milk to the{Milk         
{Marketing Board}who collect his milk  
 twice a day in a tanker. Although the 
{E.E.C}guarantees a price for each     
 litre of milk produced, they have     
 recently cut his milk quotas due to   
 overproduction in the EEC of this     
 produce. He employers two workers and 
 grows some{maize,}but no{cereal crops.
 He hopes his children will one day    
 take over the running of the farm.
