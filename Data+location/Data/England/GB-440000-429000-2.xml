		<title>02Kippax Area (cont)...</title>
		<content> Mining was established in the 13th    
 century and by the 16th century had   
 become a considerable industry        
 although many of the local pits have  
 closed down. The majority of families 
 in the area are still involved in     
 mining however and most are at Ledston
 Luck pit which is still open, but     
 there are plans to close this in the  
 near future. The village began as a   
 few cottages lining Main Street but   
 has rapidly expanded during the last  
 ten years with new housing            
 developments making Kippax virtually  
 an overspill of Leeds. This has caused
 some friction between old 'Kippaxers' 
 and the 'newcomers'.
