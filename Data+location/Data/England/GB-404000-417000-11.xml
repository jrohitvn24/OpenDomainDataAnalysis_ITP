		<content>   {Broom Hill}nearby is an unmade road
 over a mile long with just five houses
 alongside it. In bad winters people   
 who live there need a Landrover if    
 they want to get to work.             
    {Krumlin }is on a hill top on the  
 other side of the valley from         
 Broomhill.It is more sheltered and has
 proper roads.It is a small hamlet.    
     {Branch Road}is in the bottom of  
 the valley.It is a sheltered place and
 trees grow well.The houses are few and
 far between.                          
      Nearly all the houses in these   
 areas are over a hundred years        
 old.Most have been fully restored.Many
 of the small farmhouses have been     
 modernised and are owned by people who
 commute to Manchester or Leeds.       
      The countryside around here is   
 beautiful and is ideal for walkers or 
 cyclists.                             </content>
