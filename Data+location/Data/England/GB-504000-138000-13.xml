		<title>13THE ART AND CRAFTS SOCEITY</title>
		<content>   When Cranleigh Church of England    
 School moved to a modern new site it  
 was decided to use the attractive     
 stone_built Schoolhouse as a centre   
 for Art and Craft.                    
   One wing of the building is used as 
 a pottery, another as a studio and the
 two centre class rooms form a large   
 room for meetings. There is also a    
 coffee bar which houses small         
 exhibitions. A wide range of interests
 are catered for including drawing,    
 painting, sewing, pottery, films and  
 photography.  Meetings are held       
 regularly and many interesting outside
 experts and speakers are invited.     
   Every March a great exhibition is   
 held in the Village Hall for three    
 days and many pictures and craft items
 are for sale.                         
   There are also classes in art,      
 pottery and drama for children.       </content>
