		<content> The school's old building was         
 established in 1893. It now occupies  
 the annexe building which was the     
 Heath Clark School. It has always been
 a single sex primary school serving   
 the local community. Older pupils in  
 their "eighties" recollect the        
 Ursuline Convent nearby on the London 
 Road, an orchard at Goston Gardens and
 rose nurseries stretching to Mitcham  
 Common. School began at 9a.m and ended
 at four o'clock. Two hours' lunch     
 break enabled children to go home for 
 dinner. The School Bell in the Tower  
 marked the passage of time. Girls were
 not caned but were smacked for        
 misdemeanours. Playground games have  
 changed little, jacks, skipping,      
 french skipping, two balls still      
 remain popular. Holidays were         
 infrequent and pocket money seemed to 
 be about 2 1/2p per week.             </content>
