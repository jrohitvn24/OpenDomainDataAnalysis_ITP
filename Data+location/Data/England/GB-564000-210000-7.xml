peas, sugar beet, potatoes, and maize. 
   Animals are limited to pigs,        
chickens, pheasants, geese and ducks.

allowing for the easy use of machinery 
which comprises mainly combine         
harvesters, tractors, fork lifts,      
diggers and trucks.The fields tend to  
be irregular in shape. Labour is low   
due to the use of machinery.

area.

with the rooting up of hedgerows by    
farmers in order to make larger        
fields.
