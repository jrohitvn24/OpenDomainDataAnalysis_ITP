		<title>01PRESTWICH - INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> There is no mention of{Prestwich}in   
 the Domesday Book of 1086 but there is
 a record that in 1193 AD a Robert de  
 Prestwich was fined for supporting    
 Count John against Richard I          
                                       
 The name of{Prestwich}is taken from   
 Preost-the old English for Priest-    
 and Wyc meaning dwelling place.The    
 name is known locally as "priests'    
 retreat".                             
                                       
 Prestwich has undergone considerable  
 change over recent years.From being a 
 village it has grown to a town having 
 a population of 35,000 administered by
{Bury Metropolitan Council.}It contains
{Heaton Park,}the largest municipal    
 park in the U.K. also the second      
 largest{Jewish community}is resident  
 in Prestwich and the immediate area.
