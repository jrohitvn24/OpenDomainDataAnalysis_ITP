  When we go out to play, we play      
 football,{'Kingy'}or cricket.If there 
 are enough of us we play'Cat &amp;        
 Mouse',{'Blocker'}(hide and seek) or  
 football.When we have enough time we  
 go down to Conways bike shop and have 
 a look at the BMX and racer bikes.    
 On Saturday mornings we go swimming at
 the new{Leisure Centre} or Derby      
 Street Baths.                         
 We also use some words in our playing 
 that children from other places might 
 not know.'Skinch' for instance means  
 you can't be caught and when we're    
 running around someone might shout    
 "don't {coin} or you'll {dunch}"      
 "don't turn round or you'll bump"     
 Also, if you don't want to be the     
 blocker in hide and seek, you         
 shout"bags no man".
