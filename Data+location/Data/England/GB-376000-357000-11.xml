		<title>11Transport - Canal</title>
		<content> 17th and 18th century efforts were    
 made to improve the river navigations 
 that already existed which led to the 
 building of the canals. In 1765 Josiah
 Wedgewood suggested a canal linking   
 the ports of Hull and Liverpool. This 
 was the start of the Trent and Mersey 
 Canal. The first sod was cut in July  
 1766 by Wedgewood at Burslem. The     
 Harecastle Tunnel south east of block 
 03760357 held up the completion of the
 canal until 1777. Originally the canal
 had 75 locks. The deplth of the canal 
 was 5ft 6ins. There were 109 road     
 bridges and five tunnels. The stretch 
 of canal running through this block   
 has 10 locks and an aquaduct. A fall  
 in traffic is illustrated by these    
 figures. {1848-1,341,622 tons}1888 -
