		<content> We visited the"Croydon Advertiser" on 
 6th june.We met a reporter called     
 Cathy Gallagher.She took us to        
 Mr.Collard who is the executive       
 editor.We interviewed him, and had our
 photographs taken by the chief        
 photographer,Colin Woodcock.          
 We went to the typing room to see the 
 typists at work.Then we saw some very 
 skilled people cut articles to the    
 right size to fit into the            
 newspaper.Then we saw strips of paper 
 with holes in which were put into a   
 computerised machine.That turned into 
 a whole article for printing.We went  
 into the dark room and saw our photos 
 developed on a special machine which  
 could make the photo any size.The     
 "Advertiser" is the main local        
 newspaper for the Croydon area.
