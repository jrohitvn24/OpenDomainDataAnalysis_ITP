		<content> The Darby and Joan Club meet at the   
 Victory Club in Napton on Tuesday     
 afternoon twice a month. The club is  
 twenty-five years old and has 45      
 members. About 25 people regularly    
 attend meetings where they have       
 speakers, play bingo, have raffles and
 go on outings. They have tea and      
 cakes. Last week the post lady played 
 her piano accordian and sang songs.   
 At Christmas the members went to the  
 school Christmas concert and after the
 performance, they had tea.
