		<title>10The Warren</title>
		<content> The Warren has got {fifty acres.}     
 Before Mr and Mrs Browning came it    
 used to be a stable and they used to  
 live in the big white house next door 
 to them. They sold the house but      
 still own all the land.The servants   
 and stable boys used to live up above 
 the stables.They rent all their land  
 to a farmer who lives nearby.The      
 Warren was {built in 1850.}They       
 haven't got a well but on the map it  
 says they have.The have got a mixture 
 of coniferous and deciduous trees.They
 haven't got chickens.They have got    
 two Shetland Ponies and a tame male   
 pheasant who can feed out of your hand
 and sometimes he brings his mate.They 
 let people they know come and look    
 around their very big garden.
