		<title>04A Summer walk   cont.</title>
		<content>    We saw both hares and rabbits on   
 our walk, and evidence of deer,fox and
 pheasant tracks in the mud at the edge
 of a stream we crossed.               
   The area is well-wooded and we saw  
 elm trees which had been chopped down 
 because they were diseased.Near to    
 them young elms were sprouting up from
 underground suckers.One of the woods  
 we passed through contained larch     
 trees and here there was no           
 undergrowth because of the thick      
 carpet of pine needles.               
   In addition to the large oak and ash
 trees we saw silver birch, elders and 
 hazels.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
