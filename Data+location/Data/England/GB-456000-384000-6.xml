		<title>06FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM</title>
		<content> Over the recent weeks,there has been  
 alot of{football  hooliganism}but the 
 worst tragedy of hooligans took place 
 in{Brussels},where the{European cup   
{final}was played between{Liverpool}and
 Juventus ,and because of the rioting a
 wall collapsed and{38 Italians}and{1  
{Belgian}lost their lives.We asked the 
 class what they thought of football   
 hooligans.Some thought it made them   
 very sad or{ashamed.}Others thought it
 was{idiotic.}They thought the selling 
 of{drinks}should be stopped.Some      
 thought the game should be played     
 behind closed{doors}and they were     
 scared to go to{football matches.One  
{teacher}said that people{don't realize
{how bad it is.}They only know,if they 
 are there{themselves.Another teacher  
{has to}decide which{fans}don't cause  
 trouble so she can take her{son}to a  
 match.                                </content>
