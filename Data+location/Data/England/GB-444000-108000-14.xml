		<content>  Mayfield Park was once the site of a 
 large house which was the home of the 
 Chamberlayne family. Most of the      
 Eastern outskirts of Southampton      
 belonged to the{Chamberlayne Estates. 
  The house was demolished in the 1950s
 when it became unsafe. It had been    
 used as a temperory home for displaced
 persons after the war.                
  The actual house site is now a       
 bowling green complete with club house
 and toilets.There are beautiful{formal
{gardens,}enormous shady pine trees and
 good hiding places in the thick       
 woods.There are swings,a climbing     
 frame,a slide and a roundabout to play
 on.There is also a concrete skateboard
 track sweeping down the hill.         
  A tall obelisk stands on top of the  
 hill commemorating a horse.The old    
 lodge house is still occupied and the 
 stables are used as council storage.  </content>
