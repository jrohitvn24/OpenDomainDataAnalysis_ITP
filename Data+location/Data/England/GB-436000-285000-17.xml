		<title>17THE FACTORY</title>
		<content> The front of the factory looks like a 
 small house but inside it is          
 massive.It has been a family business 
 since 1890 to 1973.It was commission  
 weaving but now it is hosiery.They    
 chose to have the factory in          
{BULKINGTON }because very good         
 weavers lived there.                  
 Now they sell medical tights which are
 very thick but they also sell thinner 
 ones. The prices are from Â£2.00 to    
 Â£15.00.On the old machines it takes 12
 minutes to weave a pair of tights,on  
 the new machines it takes only 2      
 minutes.The dye smelt horrible,it     
 takes 3 hours to dye the tights.      
 Altogether they have 29 days          
 holiday.They have only one week at    
 Christmas, Easter and spring break    
 and two weeks for the summer.
