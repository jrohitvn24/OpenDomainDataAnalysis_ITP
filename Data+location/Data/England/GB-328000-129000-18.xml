 When we play Chain game,two poeple    
 hold hands and have to run about      
 trying to touch other people without  
 breaking the chain.The one caught has 
 to join the chain, and so on.

 Somebody stands touching a wall. He   
 or she has to touch other people, then
 they do the same until everybody has  
 been caught.The  Infants play many    
 games including 'Creep mouse','Mr

 Lemons'.Sometimes the Juniors play    
 too.In school we play Football,       
 Rounders, Netball and Athletics.
