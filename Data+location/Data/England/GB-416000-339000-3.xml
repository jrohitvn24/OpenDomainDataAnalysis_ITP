		<title>03WHY I LIKE VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content>    I like living in Hales Green, near 
 Yeaveley, because of the peace and    
 quiet, and because we don't have as   
 much air pollution.                   
    There is lots of room for roller_  
 skating and things like that. We don't
 have any shops so there aren't many   
 people.                               
    We don't have any tourists like    
 Ashbourne does. We can go for walks in
 the country_side instead of the park. 
 There are more hills to sledge on in  
 the winter. It is safer on the road   
 because there are not as  many cars as
 in a town.                            
    There is more wildlife in the woods
 next to where we live than you would  
 find in a town park.                  
    You can also communicate better    
 with your friends without going far   
 away, so you know and have more       
 friends.                              </content>
