   It's 7 a.m. and the trains to London
 are already rumbling past the end of  
 Station Road where I live. My daughter
 drives off to her job in Wembley, my  
 son goes to school in Snaresbrook, my 
 husband walks to his{business}nearby  
 and I stroll to Loughton High School. 
   I spend my day{teaching}Business    
 Studies, emerging again at 4 p.m. to  
 call for my mother in Lower Park Road 
 and take her to the library in Traps  
 Hill. At 6 p.m. I drive to Sainsbury's
 in Chingford to buy the week's        
 groceries because I do not like       
 Loughton's one and only{supermarket.  
   The rest of the evening will be     
 spent at home marking, reading or     
 watching TV with the family .         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
