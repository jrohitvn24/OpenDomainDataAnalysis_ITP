		<title>18Belstead House</title>
		<content>Belstead House is situated on the edge 
of the area and overlooks the new road 
linking the Southern by-pass with the  
new Orwell Bridge. It once stood in    
its own grounds, but is now flanked on 
two sides by modern housing.  The sale 
of the land provided funds to build a  
dining extension to the House.  Dating 
back to probably the seventeenth       
century, the House was in use for many 
years as the residence of visiting     
circuit judges. It is now an adult     
education centre run by Suffolk County 
Council and it offers residential      
courses to the general public and in   
particular to teachers.Typical courses 
this year include: Micro electronics   
writing workshop, Middle management in 
secondary schools, Practical story     
telling, Primary mathematics 5-9,The   
Suffolk Curriculum - implementation.
