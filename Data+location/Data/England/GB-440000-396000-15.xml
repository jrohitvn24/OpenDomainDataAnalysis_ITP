		<content>    Rawmarsh has seen many changes     
 since 1960.                           
    On the site of{St.Mary's}school    
 were a dance hall and old cottages and
 where{Green Lane}police station stands
 there used to be a row of old houses  
 and an alchemist's shop.              
    The{Manor Farm}estate is on the    
 site of the original Manor Farm and   
{Monkwood Estate}is situated on the old
 Bluebell Wood.                        
    An old sweet shop and chapel stood 
 where{Green Rise}is today and{Stubbin 
{Close,}one of the newest streets, used
 to be the road to Stubbin Colliery and
 a farm. The slag-heaps were turned    
 into a field for the{Comprehensive    
{School}which also has new 'ROSLA',    
 sports and craft blocks.              
    Nearing completion is the estate of
{Rosehill Gardens}built on the grounds 
 of the old Rosehill Hospital.         </content>
