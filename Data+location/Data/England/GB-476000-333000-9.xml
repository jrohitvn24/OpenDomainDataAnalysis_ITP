		<content> Nowadays it is possible for 160 cows  
 to be milked single handed at  one    
 milking and this is all due to present
 day technology.Most farms have        
 automatic rotary parlours .It is      
 possible for 14 cows to be milked at  
 once being fed their cake             
 automatically and being released after
 milking.In order to produce a good    
 amout of milk the cows need correct   
 feeding .In summer they need plenty of
 green grass and protein and in winter 
 they eat silage which has been        
 produced in summer and also           
 cow cake.Each cow on overage produces 
 4 gallons of milk per day.Their milk  
 is used in many different ways        
 including the making of               
 cheese,cream,yoghurt and butter.
