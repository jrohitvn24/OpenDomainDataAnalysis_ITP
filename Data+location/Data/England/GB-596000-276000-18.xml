		<title>18CHURCHES:HOPTON BENEFICE</title>
		<content>The churches of Barningham,Coney Weston
&amp; Market Weston form this benefice     
under the Rector of Hopton. Market     
Weston &amp; Coney Weston churches lie out-
side the villages, the former a land-  
mark across open fileds.Barningham is  
in the centre of the older part of the 
village,some distance from new housing 
developments.The churches have to share
services in rotation.Communion,Morning 
&amp; Evening prayer are held at 8, 9.30,  
11 &amp; 6 (6.30) with Evening prayer at   
Coney Weston at 3 in winter as there   
is no eletricity. Anglicans &amp; Method-  
ists hold regular united services in   
Barningham. Congregations there have   
increased &amp; there is a good Sunday     
School.The churches &amp; churchyards are  
tended by volunteers.The   churches    
are no longer the centre of   village  
life yet many,not attending themselves 
would be shocked if they closed.       </content>
