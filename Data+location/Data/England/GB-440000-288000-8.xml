		<content> The church is called St. Botolph's    
 church. St. Botolph was born in the   
 7th century and 64 churches are       
 dedicated to him in England.          
 The church lies near to most of the   
 houses, and is used for village       
 meetings and as a polling station     
 because there is no hall. It is made  
 of sandstone and has a square tower.  
 Over the doorway is a sundial and in  
 the tower are five bells.The gate,    
 which is falling apart, was erected to
 commemorate Queen Elizabeth 2         
 coronation, and a new one to replace  
 it will remember those who died in the
 war. Records at the church go back to 
 1574. There have been congregations of
 over 30 in the past but there are only
 about 10 now. The vicar is also in    
 charge of Wolvey church.
