		<title>13LIVING ON A FARM</title>
		<content> My Dad is a farmer at High Mickley on 
 the South side of the village. He has 
 cows and calves and sheep and lambs.  
 He grows corn and barley. As well as  
 being a farmer he builds trailers to  
 sell.                                 
 My Mum and I are interested in Roman  
 history and are going to dig at the   
 Roman camp at Vindolanda in the school
 holidays. It is nice living in the    
 country.

 My Dad is a farmer. He has to know a  
 lot about machines because he has to  
 look after the tractors and the       
 combine harvester.                    
 I go to Mickley School on a special   
 bus.
