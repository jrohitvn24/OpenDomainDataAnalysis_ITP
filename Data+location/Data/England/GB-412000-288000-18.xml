The M6 motorway,elevated on concrete   
pillars,passes through the block. The  
nearest junctions are at Gravelly Hill 
and Castle Bromwich.                   
The Birmingham to Derby railway line   
runs below the motorway.The nearest    
stations are at Water Orton and        
Birmingham,New Street.Scheduled        
passenger aircraft approach the airport
from Ireland and Scotland.Others are   
European charter flights.              
Eleven bus routes pass through the     
block.One follows the outer ring road. 
The others link the city centre and    
suburbs.Many families own cars.More    
than half also use local buses         
frequently.A Light Rapid Transit       
facility using electric trams is       
planned  between Castle Bromwich and   
the city centre,operating from 1992.It 
is strongly opposed locally.           </content>
