		<content> In 1985 the people of Stoke Church    
 were struggling to increase the small 
 congregation and to maintain their    
 ancient building with this latter task
 proving much the easier.  Raising     
 money for roof and belfrey repairs    
 through coffee mornings, jumble sales,
 flower festivals and wine and cheese  
 parties is being successful since the 
 building retains a place in the       
 affection of the villagers.  Many     
 children have been baptized, weddings 
 solemnized and these ceremonies have  
 forged a link between Church and      
 village.  The Gospel of Christ is much
 less treasured and Stoke only has the 
 one service each Sunday. The Worship  
 is a variety of modern services and   
 the much loved hymns and chants of    
 past years.  Hopefully such a pattern 
 will help people of different ages to 
 draw close to God.                    </content>
