		<content>  Most homes have a radio and          
 television set. Newspapers and        
 Periodicals are delivered to the      
 villages. A mobile library visits     
 every two weeks.                      
  The first level of local government  
 is the Parish Council, which meets    
 annually and extraordinary meetings   
 are called when necessary.            
  South Oxfordshire District Council   
 provides services such as housing,    
 refuse collection, recreation, and    
 environmental health. Oxfordshire     
 County Council provides major services
 such as education, libraries, fire    
 protection, social services and       
 planning.                             
  A fortified bunker exists in the     
 basement of Woodeaton School to enable
 local administration to continue in   
 times of National Emergency. It is a  
 comprehensive nuclear shelter.        </content>
