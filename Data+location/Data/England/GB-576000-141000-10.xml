		<title>10Staplehurst Marching Band.</title>
		<content>   The band was formed in April 1983.It
 consisted of twelve boys and girls    
 ranging in age from 5 to 15.The object
 of the band is to teach children to   
 play instruments,for example drums,   
 bell lyres and brass instruments      
 without them having to learn to read  
 music.This enables any child to play  
 in the band within six weeks of join- 
 ing. When they have learned to play   
 their instrument (which the band      
 supplies) they take part in marching  
 routines and playing popular music    
 such as"The Theme from the Magnificent
 Seven";"The Chariots of Fire";"Doh,   
 Ray,Me"and "You'll Never Walk Alone". 
   Today in June 1985 we have nineteen 
 members who are taking part in fetes  
 and carnivals all over the country.
