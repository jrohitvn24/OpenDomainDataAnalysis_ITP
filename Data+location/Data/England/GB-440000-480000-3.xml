		<title>03A School Day In Thirsk.</title>
		<content> When I get up in the morning, I have a
 wash, and put on my uniform.  It is   
 all brown except for a blue shirt. My 
 blazer has the emblem of the school on
 it, which is the white Yorkshire Rose 
 with a Falcon. You can wear brown or  
 black trousers, and grey socks, but   
 most boys wear white socks to make    
 them look hard. I have my breakfast   
 and then go to catch the bus.         
 I am in the First Year of my          
 Secondary Education. Our school has   
 lots of class rooms which each have   
 about 3O desks. Also, there are two   
 Dining Rooms, a Hall and a Sports     
 Hall. The Sports Hall has 4 Badminton 
 courts, a 5-aside Football pitch and  
 other things which, are fun.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
