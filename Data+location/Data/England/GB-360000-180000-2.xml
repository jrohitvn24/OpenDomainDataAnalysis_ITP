		<content>   Half the block is farmed - 3/4 of   
 this is grass,the rest is used for    
 crops eg wheat,barleyand oats.        
   There are{7 active farms}- Bailey's 
 Court (115ha),Grange (83ha),Leyland   
 Court (73ha),Manor (72ha),Knightwood  
 (48ha),Mulgrove (23ha) and Greenacres 
 (19ha).                               
   Most farms concentrate on animal    
 rearing,beef is most important then   
 sheep fattening,dairying and some pig 
 rearing                               
   Farm land was lost by the building  
 of the M4.Other land has been sold for
 house building,a school,the motorcycle
 centre and the windsurfing lake.      
  Farmers nearer the housing complained
 of gates being left open and of       
 stealing becoming a problem.          
   In the near future farms to the west
 of the M4 expect to lose their land to
 the major housing development plans.. </content>
