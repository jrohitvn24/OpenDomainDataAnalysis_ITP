Families in Raunds and Hargrave are    
very much the same as any other family 
across the British Isles.They do       
hobbies, such as fishing, swimming,    
tennis and football, in their leisure  
time. In Raunds and Hargrave there     
are no leisure centres so we have      
to go to Rushden which is about        
five miles away or we go to            
Wellingborough which is about ten      
miles away.Some families like going to 
visit places of interest such as old   
houses or ruins of castles. Many       
families have pets such as cats, dogs, 
rabbits, goldfish or birds. These are  
kept for enjoyment for all the family. 
On week days many people go to         
work. Some go all over the country and 
they even work  abroad in places like  
America, Saudi Arabia, Germany or many 
other far away countries.              </content>
