		<title>15More on Polsue Manor Farm</title>
		<content> The cow shed was built in 1984.It was 
 built of pine wood with steel gates   
 inside to keep the cows in if         
 necessary.The farmer does not use the 
 cows for milking anymore.             
  They grow crops as well.Silage is one
 of the crops that he grows,but the    
 main crops are Spring barley and      
 Winter barley.the farmer sells the    
 barley on the open market for cash.He 
 uses chemicals to help the crops grow 
 stronger.                             
  The farmer owns a sheepdog to round  
 up the sheep.He controls the dog by   
 saying Come By and Away.Come by means 
 to the left and away means to the     
 right.                                
  The farmers wife also runs a Bed and 
 Breakfast.
