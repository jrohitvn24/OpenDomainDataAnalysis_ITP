		<title>03Landscape of Thundersley.</title>
		<content> Unlike South Benfleet, Thundersley is 
 situated on a plateau. From the hill  
 on which the ancient church of St     
 Peter stands, there are magnificent   
 views across the Essex countryside,   
 from the Thames to the Crouch. The old
 London road,now the A.13,runs through 
 Thundersley to Southend and gives the 
 district easy access to neighbouring  
 areas. Light industries took up places
 along this route and small clothing   
 factories, outposts of the East London
 "Rag-trade",can still be found here.  
 Although much of the area has been    
 taken up by private housing and small 
 housing estates,remnants of the  old  
 royal forests still exist:Coombe Wood 
 and Thundersley Glen which were once  
 part of a royal manor. The lodge      
 belonging to King John has, alas,been 
 demolished,but the connection survives
 through a local comprehensive school. </content>
