		<title>13Clun Carnival and Show</title>
		<content> Clun Carnival takes place every year  
 on the first Saturday in August. The  
 carnival procession starts at School  
 Road. It consists of fancy dress      
 classes. There are classes for        
 individuals, groups and drays. The    
 processional route is: Church Street  
 Bridge Street, High Street, Ford      
 Street, Newport Street, Castle Street 
 and into The Square. Every year there 
 is a carnival queen and she has an    
 attendant and page boy. After they    
 have crowned the queen the procession 
 goes to the Castle Grounds. There they
 have stalls, a large exhibitors' tent 
 and a brass band playing. During the  
 afternoon there are competitions,     
 sideshows, amusements and refreshments
 for everyone. Clun Show has three     
 sections for the exhibitor. They are  
 the Horticultural, Agricultural, and  
 Homecraft sections.                   </content>
