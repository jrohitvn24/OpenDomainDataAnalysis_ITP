		<content> The Bull's Head pub is over 400 Years 
old and was used by the drivers of the 
Old London to Dover Road before Pole   
Hill was cut.There is a story that     
Dick Turpin used the tunnel that went  
from Pear Tree Cottage,where he was    
supposed to have stayed,to the Bull's  
Head. The tunnel is now blocked off    
because a house has been built on top. 
The Buff Orpington pub was so named    
after a breed of chicken developed by  
William Cook. He started life as a     
coach man,and bred chickens at Tower   
House, Orpington. In 1886 the first    
Orpington chicken, know as the black   
Orpington,was produced from a langsham 
variety.
