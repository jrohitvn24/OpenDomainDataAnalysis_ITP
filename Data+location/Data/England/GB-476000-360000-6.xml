		<title>06Vera Sampson of Norwell</title>
		<content>  { Mrs Vera Sampson}was born in{1912} 
{in Norwell}and has lived there all her
 life. Her father was the first person 
 to have a crystal set.                
    She remembers the time when all of 
 the roads  were{cobbled}and how she   
 used to travel to Newark by{horse and 
{carriage.}The games she used to play  
 are different to ones we play today;  
 whip and top, fox and hounds, paper   
 chasing.                              
    She remembers 2 pubs, 2 shops, a   
 joiner, a black smith, a butcher, and 
 a wheelwright in the village. In 1984 
{Karl Brown,}who is 24, set himself up 
 as a{farrier}and he is the only       
 practising blacksmith in the area.    
    Nowadays, many children in our     
 school go abroad for their holidays   
 but the highlight of Mrs Sampson's    
 holiday was swimming with her         
 friends in the nearby {Beck. }        </content>
