		<title>15BLUEBELL STEAM RAILWAY</title>
		<content> The reopening of part of the former   
 Brirish Rail line from Horstead Keynes
 to East Grinstead is a major talking  
 point.The Bluebell railway runs from  
 Sheffield Park to Horstead Keynes. It 
 is run by a group of steam train      
 enthusiasts as a living steam train   
 museum and the group now wants to join
 up with the British Rail system by the
 year 2000. Opposition to the scheme   
 comes from landowners of the former   
 track bed, closed in the mid 60s,     
 which is now used for agriculture &amp;   
 horticulture. Residents of the        
 Imberhorne housing estate are also    
 against the scheme as the former      
 railway cutting through the estate has
 been filled with household refuse and 
 they fear a major health hazard if the
 thousands of tons of rotting rubbish  
 are dug up and moved.
