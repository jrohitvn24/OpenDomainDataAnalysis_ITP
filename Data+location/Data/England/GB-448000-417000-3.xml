		<content>    The section of the A1 which passes 
 through the area is very busy.People  
 who live in the area  rely on it to   
 get to places quickly .Its link with  
 the M62 is also important.            
     Until fairly recently the road ran
 through the centre of the villages.   
 There used to be several coaching inns
 which did a good trade. Most of these 
 have now disappeared, but the villages
 still cater for tourists and other    
 travellers. As the amount of traffic  
 grew, it began to spoil the villages, 
 making life uncomfortable and         
 sometimes dangerous for the people    
 living there.                         
      Today, Darrington has a flyover  
 with access roads, while the A1 is    
 carried over the Went Valley by a     
 large viaduct, with a small loop road 
 through the village. This is helpful  
 for drivers who need a rest or a meal.</content>
