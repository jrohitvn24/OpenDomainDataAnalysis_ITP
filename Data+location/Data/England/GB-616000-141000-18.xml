		<content>   All children from Elham and some    
 from surrounding areas came to the old
 Elham school. In December of 1969 the 
 new school was completed and an       
 extension was finished in 1975. Some  
 money from the Sir John Williams hall 
 still provides help for the new school
 and other eductional societies. The   
 school provides excellent educational 
 facilities for the 86 pupils. In the  
 last few years the school has achieved
 considerable success in local music   
 competitions under tutition from a    
 Kent School of Music teacher. The     
 Violin and Recorder are the most      
 popular. The secondary schools are in 
 Folkestone and Hythe.                 
   Now the John Wiiliams hall is used  
 for a pre-school playgroup and Piano  
 lessons are given by Lady Douglas.
