     Lotus was built in 1901,84 years  
ago. There are 618 people employed     
there.                                 
     Each day they make 10,000 pairs of
shoes,that's 50,000 pairs a week!The   
staff work 8 hours and a half each day 
including lunch time.                  
     All the leather Lotus uses comes  
from Italy ,and 80% of each shoe       
consists of man made material.Every    
year they go to shoe exhibitions to    
see the latest styles.                 
     There are two other Lotus         
factories at Northampton and in        
Ireland.                               
      My dad works at Lotus.He puts the
soles on the shoes.Their biggest       
competition comes from the Clarks shoe 
factory .   Tracey Jones  aged 9
