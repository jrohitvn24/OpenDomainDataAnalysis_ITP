		<title>10Gayles House Farm</title>
		<content>   My name is{Ian Herring}and I farm at
{Gayles House Farm}which is situated in
 the small village of{Gayles}lying on  
 the higher ground between Richmond and
 Barnard Castle. It is a family farm   
 and I am helped in the daily tasks by 
 my wife {Mary} and my father{ Robert} 
 who is aged 76 years and who, in spite
 of being long past retirement age,    
 continues to take an active interest  
 in the farm - like the "old soldiers  
 who never die", old farmers don't     
 retire, "they simply fade away"! Our  
 children{Andrew, Stephen, Rachel}and  
{Jane}are also able to help with a     
 number of jobs although Andrew isn't  
 really interested in farmwork as such,
 he would rather be out around the     
 fields with his gun, shooting rabbits.
 We have{105 acres,}all of it grassland
 on which we raise and run a herd of 47
 dairy cows.                           </content>
