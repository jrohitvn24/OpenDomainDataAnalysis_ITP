The Beacon is a prominent feature on   
the local landscape.It is part of the  
range of hills known as the Chilterns  
and at its highest point is 750 feet   
above sea level.On the top of the      
Beacon there is a triangulation point  
for the Ordnance Survey and at times of
national celebration signal fires have 
been lit on the summit.The Beacon is   
said to be the burial place of Iron Age
chiefs but this is not established     
fact.Many people visit the Beacon each 
year,and model aeroplane enthusiasts   
find the Beacon an ideal site for      
flying their radio controlled gliders  
and powered planes.The paths and tracks
which lead to the Beacon are now very  
worn from the heavy use they receive   
and plans for their protection are     
currently in hand.
