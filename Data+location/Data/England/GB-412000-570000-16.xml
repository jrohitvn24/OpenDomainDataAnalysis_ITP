		<content>{"Recreation Field"(The Flush)}        
   This is an oval-shaped area of 10   
 acres, being the only designated open 
 space on the estate. There is a small 
 football pitch but most of the space  
 is grassland and shrubs. To protect it
 from housing development, it has      
 recently been created a{Site of       
{Special Scientific Interest,}being one
 of the few remaining areas of         
 semi-natural grassland in the county- 
 noted for several plant species       
 uncommon in{Northumberland.   }       
       There is a conflict of interest 
 between those residents who wish to   
 have more recreational facilities such
 as a B.M.X.track and those who wish   
 the natural habitat to remain. Local  
 schools use it for walks and nature   
 study occasionally...there being a    
 good selection of wild flowers.
