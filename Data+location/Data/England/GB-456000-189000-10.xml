		<title>10Brightwell School</title>
		<content>There has been a school in Brightwell  
for many years. In 1985 the School is  
housed in modern buildings. We have 120
children aged from 5 to 11 years of    
age - in four classes.                 
The headteacher is Mr M.Lintern, the   
Deputy Head is Mr N. King who together 
teach the two classes of older         
children, and Mrs Humphrys and Mrs     
Dawson who teach the younger children. 
Mrs Whitten is the part time teacher.  
Children learn a wide variety of topics
at school and we try to give them first
hand experience whenever possible.     
Subjects include, maths, English,      
reading, science, religion, projects,  
P.E. and games, art and craft, history 
and geography and computer studies.    
Trips and residential visits to places 
of interest give children the chance to
learn about themselves, as well as the 
world around them.                     </content>
