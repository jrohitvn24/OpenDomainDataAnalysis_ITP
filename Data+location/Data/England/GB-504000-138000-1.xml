		<title>01ALL ABOUT CRANLEIGH</title>
		<content>   Our village, popularly supposed to  
 be the largest village in England,    
 lies between Guildford and Horsham in 
 the Lower Weald. Just north of the    
 village the land rises to the wooded  
 slopes of the Greensand Ridge.        
   Although not mentioned in the       
 Domesday Book the tiny hamlet of      
 "Craneley" formed part of the Manor of
 Shere owned by Editha, wife of Edward 
 the Confessor.                        
   It was named after the cranes, a    
 popular table bird in Norman times    
 which were bred on the many ponds.    
   Until the 1960's the village        
 retained its quiet rural atmosphere   
 but the development of several large  
 housing estates caused a sudden rise  
 in the population.                    
   The spelling was changed to         
 Cranleigh at the request of the GPO to
 avoid confusion with Crawley.         </content>
