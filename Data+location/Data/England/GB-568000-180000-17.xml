		<title>17PLAYGROUND GAMES 2</title>
		<content>   Yellow Lines is played on a Netball 
 Court.This is a very crazy game.One   
 person has to chase the others round  
 the court.Any number of people can    
 play.Ladders is played by people      
 sitting opposite each other and a     
 caller standing in front of them.The  
 caller shouts a number and the people 
 who have that number run to the caller
 and back again.The first person back  
 to their place wins a point for their 
 team.Volley Ball has the same rules as
 the proper game but the net is        
 replaced by the lines of the Netball  
 Court.Off Ground Touch is another     
 chasing game with the rule that a     
 person cannot be tagged if they are   
 off the ground.No one we asked knew   
 where or how these games originated.  
 They seem to be passed on from child  
 to child.                             
                                       </content>
