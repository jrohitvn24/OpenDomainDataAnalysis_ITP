		<title>12Farms near Chobham, Woking</title>
		<content>     Off Chobham Road, the main road in
 Chobham, are several secondary roads  
 that lead to farms and nurseries, one 
 of which, Mimbridge, incorporates a   
 garden centre. Nearby is a{pig}farm,  
 specialising in Landrace and Durox    
 breeds, also some pasture land for    
 horses. Also on the north side of the 
 road is a{mushroom}farm covering      
 sixteen acres. Further down the road  
 is a stream, The Bourne. The stream is
 clear of vegetation and the water     
 flows north and it has only spread    
 a few metres across. Common Close,    
 leading off Chobham Road, contains a  
 lot of detatched houses, a marked     
 contrast to the farmland surrounding  
 them.
