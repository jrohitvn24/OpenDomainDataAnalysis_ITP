		<content> We interviewed a local councillor,her 
 name is Miss Jenny Kemp.She has been a
 councillor for many years, Lord       
 Mayor and is also a governor of our   
 school.She told us there are about    
 12,000 people in each local area known
 as a ward.There are three councillors 
 who look after each ward.It is hard   
 work but she enjoys it.She gets paid  
 Â£16 for every meeting she attends.    
 The main problems in the area are     
 unemployment, falling trade and poor  
 housing.The councillors are trying to 
 have the building of high-rise flats  
 stopped and grants made available to  
 improve housing.Many local amenities  
 have closed due to the lack of money  
 ie.libraries and clinics.Her most     
 significant role as councillor was    
 assisting in the creation of Crosby   
 Marina and opposing the extension of  
 the docks.                            </content>
