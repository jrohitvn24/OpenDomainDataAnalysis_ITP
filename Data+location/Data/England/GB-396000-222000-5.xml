		<title>05TOWARDS CLEEVE COMMON</title>
		<content> ONE THURSDAY A GROUP OF US WENT UP ON 
 CLEEVE COMMON. WHEN WE GOT THERE WE   
 GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND WENT INTO A    
 FIELD. I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF{        
{PRESTBURY}AND{WHADDON.}THEN WE WALKED 
 OVER TO A BEECH HANGER. I TOOK A      
 PHOTOGRAPH OF IT. WE ALSO TOOK SOME   
 PHOTOGRAPHS OF FLOWERS. SOME OF THE   
 FLOWERS WERE{COWSLIPS, BUTTERCUPS,    
{CLOVER, ROCK ROSES}AND{VETCHES.}THE   
 AREA WAS FULL OF CORNFIELDS WHICH HAD 
 A LANE RUNNING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF  
 THEM. MOST OF THEM WERE FULL OF{WHEAT}
 AND{BARLEY.}A FEW OF THE FIELDS WERE  
 NOT USED FOR CROPS BUT WERE USED FOR  
 CATTLE GRAZING. THERE ARE A FEW WOODED
 PLACES ON THE EDGE OF SOME FIELDS. ON 
 THE COMMON IT WAS VERY LONELY. THERE  
 WERE NO BUILDINGS AND ONLY ONE OR TWO 
 CARS PASSED US IN THE LANE.           
                                       
                                       </content>
