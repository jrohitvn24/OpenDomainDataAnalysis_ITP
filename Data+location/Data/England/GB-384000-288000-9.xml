		<title>09Ashwood Marina</title>
		<content>Ashwood Marina is built on an arm of   
the Staffordshire and Worcester Canal. 
It was originally an old coal wharf,   
where coal was transferred from the    
Kingswinford Railway to the canal      
narrowboats. The railway was built in  
1827 and was the first standard guage  
railway in the Black Country. It ran   
from Baggeridge Colliery to the Ashwood
Basin and was the only line always in  
private ownership.The locomotive,the   
Agenoria,is now in the York Railway    
Museum.The Marina act as brokers for   
the sail of boats and also provide     
berths.Boats which are sold through the
Marina are automatically entitled to a 
berth but there is a two year waiting  
list for other boats.There are 160     
boats there at the moment but there are
plans to expand it to 200 berths. The  
Marina is very pretty and peaceful and 
very well run.                         </content>
