		<title>19WESTBOURNE</title>
		<content> Westbourne is a quiet village about   
 three miles east of the Borough of    
 Havant. Much of the community consists
 of middle / upper class people. There 
 are few amenities, but all the same it
 is a picture of a Sussex village.     
                                       
 To the north of the village and south 
 of the Stansted Estate are the        
 Brickkiln Ponds. This area was        
 originally the supply of clay for the 
 local brick works.One of these ponds  
 is at present being cleaned out for   
 use as a nature reserve for water     
 birds, etc. It is hoped that the rest 
 of these ponds will be used for the   
 same purpose.
