		<content> This has been an unusually dry,       
 colourful autumn for Cornwall; it has 
 been pleasant to drive in my MINI     
 along country lanes, visiting farms,  
 discovering many aspects of country   
 life.  I have learnt a lot &amp; seen many
 animals including grey squirrels,jays,
 buzzards,pheasants,bullfinches,magpies
 &amp; woodpigeons.I am grateful to all the
 people who have talked willingly about
 their way of life in 1985.            
 Alan Kirk helped on computer problems,
 after Jonathan Pettit had struggled in
 vain with cassettes. John Pickup lent 
 B.B.C. computer and disc drive, for   
 successful recording of data.         
 Michael,18 months old, came with me.  
 Liz,15,Jonathan,13,Joanna,9,tolerated 
 several Domesday-dominated months at  
 home.Barry,G.P.in Truro wrote on Allet
 and Fairview Farms and Nurseries.     
   Susan Pettit for the Pettit Family. </content>
