		<title>18A SCHOOL NEAR WOODFORD</title>
		<content> Our school is in an old manor house.  
 In the grounds are lots of trees      
 including a big plane tree on which we
 all play . Behind this tree is the    
 River Avon. There are 59 girls in the 
 school &amp; I am in a dormitory of 10    
 girls. We have 4 matrons to look after
 us. We get up at half past seven and  
 go down to breakfast at ten to eight. 
 After breakfast we have prayers at ten
 to nine then we go into class. We have
 three lessons before break. During    
 break we groom our ponies and clean   
 out our pets. After break we have more
 lessons until lunch. In the afternoon 
 we have activities such as riding,    
 dancing, art and games,then we have   
 tea. After tea we do our prep until   
 half past six when the bell goes for  
 supper:we wash our hands, put on our  
 pinnies and go downstairs. After      
 supper we go upstairs to bed.         </content>
