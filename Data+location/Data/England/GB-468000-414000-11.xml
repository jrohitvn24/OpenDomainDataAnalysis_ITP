 clothes and Sunday best clothes. The  
 old people of the village think that  
 you got better value for money than   
 you do today. Food and rent have gone 
 up most of all the things in the      
 1950's.  Some people kept the family  
 on ten shillings (50p), a week. The   
 most commonly read newspaper was the  
 Daily Herald.

   Moorends is a small mining village  
 in South Yorkshire. The area on which 
 it is situated is flat and mainly used
 for farming. It was once a vast area  
 of marsh land. The population is      
 approximately 6000.                   
   There are two areas to Moorends, one
 which was built 15-20yrs ago and the  
 old part of the village which consists
 of mining houses. These were N.C.B.   
 property but now are Council owned.   </content>
