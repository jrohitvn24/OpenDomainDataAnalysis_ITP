		<title>20THE GRAY LADY</title>
		<content> There is a story in Branston about    
 a lady ghost. She haunts the Old Hall.
 Many years ago a young house maid     
 walked down to the lake in Branston   
 Park.The men were taking the ice off  
 the lake to freeze the meat. One man  
 slipped,fell into the lake and        
 drowned. When the lady arrived she    
 found out that the man who had fallen 
 in was her husband.She died of a      
 broken heart. As a ghost she goes to  
 the lake and cries for him. She is    
 called the Gray Lady.
