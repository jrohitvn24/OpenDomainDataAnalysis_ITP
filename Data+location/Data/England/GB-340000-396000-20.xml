		<title>20Kirkby Today:A Brief Review.</title>
		<content> Kirkby has altered greatly since      
 Norman times but particularly so      
 during the 1950's and 60's when a     
 large industrial site was built. An   
 increase in industry and workforce    
 necessitated new settlement areas,    
 additional amenities and more         
 efficient transportation networks.    
 Consequently Kirkby can now boast two 
 motorways, the M57 and M62, a         
 conference centre at the magnificent  
 Kirkby Suite, new schools and one of  
 the north's most modern town centres. 
 In addition, it has a swimming pool   
 built to Olympic standard and a first 
 class Sports Centre which is one of   
 the largest and best equipped         
 complexes in the U.K. The Athletics   
 Stadium, sited alongside, is of       
 international standard and has a      
 banked cycle track which is used by   
 the world famous Kirkby Cycling Club. </content>
