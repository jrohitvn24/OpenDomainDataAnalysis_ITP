		<title>09Craven Arms Market.</title>
		<content>    On the 12 June we went to visit the
 market.Craven Arms market is          
 relatively busy being a border town   
 close to the uplands of Mid-Wales and 
 situated in a rich agricultural area  
 of Shropshire.                        
    At 11.00 a.m. the bell rang which  
 signalled that the sheep selling was  
 to begin.There were farmers           
 everywhere.The sheep sold at prices   
 ranging from 50 to 250 pounds.After   
 being sold the sheep have their ear   
 clipped to show they have been sold.  
    After the sheep had been sold we   
 moved into the cattle ring.The cattle 
 being sold today were                 
 Hereford/Friesian cross.The cattle    
 were put into the ring through a green
 gate which was closed behind them.    
 This led them onto the scales to be   
 weighed.                              
                                       </content>
