		<title>14SAGA Day in Lostock</title>
		<content>   On Saturday 15th of June I went to  
{Lostock's SAGA Day.}We wrote our name,
 address and telephone number on the   
 programme to be put in a{raffle.      
                                       
   After we had done that we went round
 until we found the{tombola.}I paid 20 
 pence and chose a ticket, I looked at 
 it, hoping there would be a{five or a 
{zero}at the end of the number on it   
 but there was'nt. My friend picked one
 out and it was a{winner.}She won some 
{'china tea'.}I decided to have another
 go and I didn't win again. It just    
 was'nt my luck.                       
   My friend had a go on a{darts game, 
 she gave me one dart and I broke it.  
                                       
   We waited for our Mums to come and  
 pick us up. We decided to walk up to  
 the shop and get some sweets.         
 Afterwards we walked back home.       </content>
