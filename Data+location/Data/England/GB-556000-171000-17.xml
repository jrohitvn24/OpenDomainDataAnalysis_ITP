		<content>   When I go skating, I need a smooth  
 surface and I need to check my wheels 
 in case the nuts are loose.           
   I go skating every day.  I skate on 
 the footpaths in Darenth as these are 
 quite smooth.  I have fallen over a   
 few times but I have not hurt myself  
 yet.                                  
   I paid Â£16.99 for my skates.  I got 
 them from Marshall-Ward which is a    
 catalogue that sells all sorts of     
 things.                               
   I enjoy roller skating because I can
 have races with my friends and I go to
 many different places on my skates.  I
 have also entered skating competitions
 at Swanley Rollerdrome.  I haven't won
 a competition yet but I am gradually  
 becoming a better skater.
