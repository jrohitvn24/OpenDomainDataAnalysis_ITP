{KIBWORTH HALL                         
   This is a large old house on the    
 Carlton road just outside Kibworth    
 Harcourt, which used to be a private  
 residence and then a school. It is now
 a hospital for the mentally           
 handicapped.                          
   The house once belonged to the      
 Bellville family until they moved away
 from Leicestershire, and in 1958 it   
 was taken over by the Hospital        
 Management Committee and now has over 
 30 patients between the ages of 18 and
 72.                                   
    Its policy is to encourage patients
 to venture out into the world through 
 things like shopping trips and social 
 events.
