		<title>07FARMING IN HULCOTE &amp; SALFORD</title>
		<content> Farming in Hulcote and Salford has    
 been a continuous process through our 
 history. Fifteen farms are scattered  
 in the area and the greatest part of  
 the landis used to grow grain crops   
 (corn and barley). The remainder of   
 the land is used for oil seed rape and
 at times for green vegetables for     
 human consumption and animal fodder in
 the form of silage.   Cattle and sheep
 are raised for meat and dairy produce 
 and poultry for wholesale egg         
 production. Modern and time-saving    
 machinery is used to harvest the grain
 crops. The combine harvester cuts and 
 thrashes the corn in one unit         
 disgorging the grain into a trailer   
 ready for transportation. Stubble may 
 be burned under controlled conditions 
 but this is not advisable for safety  
 reasons, so it must be ploughed back  
 into the ground .                     </content>
