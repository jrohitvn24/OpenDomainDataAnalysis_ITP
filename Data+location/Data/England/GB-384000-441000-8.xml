		<content> A lovely June day, a heat haze along  
 the Utherstone Valley which portends a
 good sunny day.{PENDLE HILL}says 'warm
 and dry.' The first cup of tea, the   
 one that tastes best. I say my morning
 prayers as I dress,'Grant good Lord   
 that I fall into no sin nor run into  
 any kind of danger this day.' The     
 daily newspaper and the milk have been
 delivered to my doorstep. There is    
 talk of no milk delivery in the future
 - the newspaper contains no good news.
 I go to the village stores to collect 
 my bread. Soon the village shops will 
 be forced out of business, all these  
 big superstores will overwhelm them   
 and undercut them. The village will be
 the poorer, no village shop, no       
 village news, no meeting place for    
 housewives, no sweetshop for children 
 to choose their favourite goodies...
