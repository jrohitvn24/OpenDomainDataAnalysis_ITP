 exciting and different activities in  
 school. This year we had a Christmas  
 Concert that had a nativity play in   
 the middle.The juniors and infants    
 worked together.The juniors formed the
 choir,played the instruments (descant,
 treble and tenor recorders,xylophone, 
 chime bars,bells,and glockenspiel) and
 took the main parts in the nativity   
 play, while the infants acted the     
 smaller parts and performed their own 
 play called{The Christmas Tree.}All   
 parents were invited to come.We had   
 three performances.Last week the upper
