		<title>07History of Niton Lighthouses</title>
		<content> In 1314 the first lighthouse was built
 on St.Catherine's Hill,soon after the 
 wreck of a ship called 'The Mary of   
 Bayonne' which was carrying a cargo of
 wine from a monastery in France.Walter
 de Godeton,who owned the land where   
 the wreck occurred,claimed the wine   
 for himself.Some monks complained to  
 the Pope about it and he gave Walter  
 the task of building a lighthouse and 
 chapel as a punishment.We now call it 
 'The Pepperpot'.Unfortunately it only 
 showed up on clear nights and was     
 frequently covered in mist .Then one  
 night in 1836 a ship called 'The      
 Clarendon'was wrecked in Chale Bay.   
 Most of her company were drowned.     
 People were so shocked,that they      
 decided something had to be done;     
 they built a new lighthouse at St.    
 Catherine's Point.The light first     
 shone in 1840.                        </content>
