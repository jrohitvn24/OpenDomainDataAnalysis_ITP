		<title>07The Village Policeman, Wray</title>
		<content> Our policeman lives in the police     
 house in the village and keeps law and
 order in the area. His day begins as  
 soon as he is in uniform and signed in
 to Lancaster Headquarters on his      
 radio. During the day, he walks round 
 the village and calls at people's     
 houses to make sure they are all      
 right. He knows everyone in Wray.     
 Then he drives up on to the fells to  
 call on farmers and make sure no      
 cattle have been stolen. He keeps his 
 eyes open for anything unusual. Later 
 in the afternoon he does some         
 paperwork. After tea, he walks round  
 Mr Holt's farm and Millhouses, then   
 Force, a part of the River Hindburn,  
 to see there are no poachers.         
 Sometimes he gets called out in the   
 night to chase poachers or go to an   
 accident.
