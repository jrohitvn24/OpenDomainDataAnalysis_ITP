		<title>05    Town Roads</title>
		<content>    Deep potholes have been a problem  
 following the severe winter frosts of 
 Jan/Feb 1985. We are writing this in  
 June, and work is still going on to   
 repair the roads. It will take many   
 years before the problem of our narrow
 town roads can be solved. An          
 experiment was tried recently to have 
 a one-way system, but it was unpopular
 as people had to drive further to     
 reach nearby destinations.            
    Parked cars seriously obstruct the 
 roads, so in some places it is        
 impossible for two vehicles to pass   
 each other. It is easier to get around
 the town on a bycycle rather than in a
 car. At school children take the      
 cycling proficiency test, learning to 
 ride a bike correctly.Traffic signs   
 and signals form part of the test, as 
 well as hints on keeping cycles in    
 good condition and roadworthy.        </content>
