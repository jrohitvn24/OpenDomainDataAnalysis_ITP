		<title>02Swindon Village</title>
		<content>Once Swindon was a small village.It    
didn't even have a church until 1854.  
During the last 131 years a school has 
built as well as shops and many more   
houses. The village has expanded       
tremendously particularly during the   
past few years when the houses in      
Baldwin Way and Reynolds Close were    
built.In Swindon there is a fish shop, 
off licence,post office and newsagents.
In the last few years we have had a    
cricket field and club house.Each year 
the village holds a summer fete.The    
money from this is shared between      
St.John's Church and Himley church.    
There used to be a police station but  
now we come under Kinver police.St.    
John's church was built in 1854.The    
records show that the first wedding    
held in the church was on 25th December
1854.
