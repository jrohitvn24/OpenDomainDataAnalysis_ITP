		<content> Most people read newspapers as a      
 source of current affairs and         
 information. Locally there are the    
 National daily papers, 2 evening      
 local papers{(Express and Star}and{The
{Evening Mail}), 1 local weekly paper  
{(Kidderminster Shuttle}) and a number 
 of free papers concerned mainly with  
 advertisements. Magazines are coloured
 booklets which offer more specialist  
 information on particular hobbies or  
 trades.Both these types of            
 publications are largely financed by  
 advertisements.                       
 Advertisements provide the finance for
 2 of the 4 television channels        
 available.They are the independent    
 commercial stations{(Central TV}in    
 this area) the other two channels are 
 owned by the{BBC}to whom a licence fee
 is paid annually by the viewer.
