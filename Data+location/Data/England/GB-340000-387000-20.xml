		<title>20WE WENT FOR A WALK.</title>
		<content>  We go down the busy road towards the 
 vale. There's the Fire Station. We    
 went there once.Friendly firemen let  
 us use the hoses. This council estate 
 is nice and bright and clean. You cant
 hear the noisy road anymore. These    
 terraces are too small for large      
 families. I wonder where they live? No
 ball games allowed though. No vandals 
 either - makes a change. Look at the  
 way people take short cuts across the 
 grass - ought to put paths where      
 people want to go. Look,a wrecked van.
 No, it's a mobile shop! Going up the  
 hill now, up the ridge where the old  
 villages are. Posh houses up here.Wow!
 That one has a swimming pool - belongs
 to a footballer. I'd like to live     
 there. Big houses up here, not many   
 people about. There's a Rolls Royce!  
 I've never been here before. Into some
 woods, great, just like the country.  </content>
