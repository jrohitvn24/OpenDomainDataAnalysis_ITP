		<title>03PRINCE'S GOLF COURSE (Cont)</title>
		<content> Again during the Second World War the 
 site was occupied by the army and     
 after the war, in 1948, there was a   
 scheme to turn it into a permanent    
 military training area. Sir Aynsley   
 Bridgeland was successful in          
 preventing this. He had the derelict  
 buildings reconstructed and the land  
 cleared of broken down tanks,         
 concrete, barbed wire and tank-traps. 
 By 1949 he had re-created the course  
 on the most up to date lines.         
                                       
 In 1985 a new clubhouse was built at, 
 a mile to the north of the old one.   
 Costing Â£750000 this new facility     
 was able to provide breakfast, lunch, 
 tea, dinner or bar snacks, with a     
 restaurant seating up to 100 guests.  
 The old clubhouse was converted into  
 accommodation to augment that already 
 provided by the adjacent Dormy House. </content>
