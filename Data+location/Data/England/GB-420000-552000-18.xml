  Local traditions are further         
 remembered with quoits matches and old
 fashioned North East street games     
 revived.Local school children dress up
 in 1920'scostumes to play marbles,    
 cock-a-hoop and other favourites.The  
 local pub hosts a variety of long     
 forgotten pub pastimes.               
  The past's link with the present is  
 maintained with the grand pigeon      
 release of 2000 birds and the locally 
 popular whippet racing.               
  A selection of brass band music is   
 always listened to with great interest
 as the brass band is still held in    
 great affection in the North East.    
 This link with the past is one of the 
 major regional attractions and its    
 future at Beamish is assured for the  
 forseeable future.
