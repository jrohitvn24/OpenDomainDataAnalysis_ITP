		<content> I stumbled over the pebbles.I         
 eventually got to the salty sea.The   
 tide was quite far out but it was     
 coming in.When we arrived at the canoe
 trailer we untied the canoes and      
 carried them out to the sea.We sorted 
 out the equipment and then put on the 
 spraydecks and life-jackets.After we  
 set off we paddled towards Drigg.About
 half-way there we turned back.On the  
 way back the waves got bigger.We were 
 glad to get ashore.                   
   There are lots of people who go     
 fishing around here.Alex and I often  
 go fishing,mainly to Holmrook.When we 
 have tackled up we cast into the      
 middle of the river and wait for a    
 bite.I have a telescopic rod and Alex 
 has a two piece rod.For bait we use   
 worms and spinners.I have a new reel  
 called Omi.Alex's reel is a Clipper
