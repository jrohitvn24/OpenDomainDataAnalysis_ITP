		<title>18HOUSING AND POPULATION</title>
		<content> Most houses are detached and built of 
 brick with tiled roofs. Almost without
 exception they have gardens. Many are 
 very large. Nearly all families have a
 car and most have more than one. There
 has been little building recently.    
 Very few houses are post war (1939).  
 The population consists mainly of new-
 comers with a small nucleus of        
 established families. Very few people 
 are employed locally. Some work from  
 home.  Most commute to Guildford or   
 London. Quite a number are retired.   
{LEISURE}                              
 Many enjoy gardening, walking, horse  
 riding, tennis, badminton and         
 swimming. Many families own dogs. Half
 the people surveyed have a creative   
 hobby - music, art, carpentry. More   
 than half go abroad at least once a   
 year on holiday.
