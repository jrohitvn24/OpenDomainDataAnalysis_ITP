		<content>   {THE RECTORY}was sold when Astley   
 became part of The United Benefice. It
 is interesting to speculate whether   
 the{RECTORY GHOST}allowed himself to  
 be sold with the house!{

{   MR.P. DINGLEY,}a former Astley     
 headmaster and churchwarden, told me  
 that the Rector in charge about 10    
 years ago, saw the figure of a monk in
 a passage and that he, himself, stayed
 at the Rectory prior to taking up his 
 appointment at Astley School. As he   
 settled for the night after switching 
 off the light, he felt something brush
 across his face, though nothing was to
 be seen when he switched the light on 
 again.A sliding kitchen door and      
 cupboard doors also close on their    
 own.
