		<content> The area is a fertile one of hawthorn 
 enclosed undulating fields, streams &amp; 
 deciduous woods. The land combines    
 chalk, clay &amp; sand &amp; is crossed by a  
 network of well used public footpaths.
 Mixed farming is the main industry &amp;  
 is practised by five large landowners 
 &amp; ten smaller farmers who are the main
 employers in the area. Other work is  
 found at the Abbattoir, Nursing Home &amp;
 Woodyard in Tetford. Since Dutch Elm  
 Disease much County Council &amp; private 
 replanting of soft &amp; hard woods       
 particularly in 1973 is already       
 beginning to have an effect. Private  
 planting has been mainly for game     
 cover, namely pheasant. The older     
 dwellings are generally small &amp; built 
 of local red brick &amp; pantile roofs.
