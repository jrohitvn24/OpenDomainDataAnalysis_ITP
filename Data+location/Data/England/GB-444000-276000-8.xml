    The two villages of King's Newnham 
 and Church Lawford are in close       
 proximity to each other and have      
 therefore been counted together in our
 survey.                               
    There is not a row of shops as     
 such, although a village shop is      
 available for the essentials. Some way
 from this is a nursery set in the     
 pleasant surrounding countryside. The 
 extensive complex houses a wide       
 variety of house and garden plants.   
    Standing on the outskirts of King's
 Newnham is an old church tower of     
 historical value which dates back to  
 Medieval times.
