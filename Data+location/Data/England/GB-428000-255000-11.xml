		<title>11An interveiw with a Farmer.</title>
		<content>  Mr. Beale has lived at Stone House   
 Farm, Ashorne for 40 years. He says   
 that the farm was built in the 1500's.
                                       
 He owns 180 acres and rents a further 
 160 acres. This year his flock of     
 sheep produced 350 lambs. He grows    
 winter barley and cultivates grass for
 winter feed to his sheep.             
 On the farm there is one milking cow  
 that has calved this year. The cow    
 provides them with milk for the home. 
                                       
 Mr. Beale gets rather angry with      
 people who do not keep to footpaths.  
                                       
 He was cross also when a manned hot   
 air balloon landed among his sheep.   
 The animals were so frightened that   
 the ewes became separated from their  
 lambs.                                
                                       </content>
