		<content> Not many local customs survive in this
 area. Harvest festivals are held each 
 year with harvest suppers, followed by
 an auction of all the produce brought.
 The proceeds go towards church funds. 
 These are occasions when everyone     
 joins in. Funerals are usually very   
 large, everyone wishing to pay their  
 last respects. The local paper always 
 carries a full report with a list of  
 all those attending.  Once hop picking
 time meant that many people from      
 Birmingham and the Black Country came 
 here to help with the harvest.but the 
 customs that evolved have lapsed with 
 the widespread introduction of        
 machinery. One custom that is still   
 prevalent is the hanging of sprays of 
 hops in the home.  These are usually  
 burnt at Christmas on the Yule log.   
 Autumn fairs are still held but these 
 are no longer hiring fairs.           </content>
