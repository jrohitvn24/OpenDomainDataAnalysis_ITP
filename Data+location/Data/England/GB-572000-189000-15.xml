		<content> The{Information Technology Centre}is  
 one of 163 government sponsored       
 centres throughout the country. It is 
 based in an old school building. Part 
 of its function is to run Youth       
 Training Scheme courses in computers  
 and micro-electronics which will count
 towards City and Guild examinations in
 the future. Word processing, use of   
 computer software, programming and    
 robotics are taught.                  
 It will eventually become a business  
 in its own right by developing and    
 producing marketable goods. The ITEC  
 has an{open access}policy with local  
 companies and the community.          
 ITEC trainees spend time working in   
 local companies to gain work          
 experience. A weekly family computer  
 club is run to show people what       
 computers are capable of, and to help 
 them learn how to operate them.       </content>
