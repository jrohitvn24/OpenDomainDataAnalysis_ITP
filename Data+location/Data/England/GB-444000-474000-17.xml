		<title>17PLEASURE OF LIVING IN SESSAY</title>
		<content> In 1516 Sir Thomas More called his    
 imaginary state of ideal perfection   
 'Utopia'.  There is nothing imaginary 
 about Sessay, where in 1982 I chose to
 retire, but it is just about ideal.   
 To relax in this{delightful setting}of
 fertile land and lush pastures, to    
 breathe the forest-scented air wafting
 from the beautiful Hambleton Hills    
 cannot be far from perfection. Free   
 from many of today's stresses - here  
 they are law-abiding citizens whose   
 well- behaved children are taught to  
 respect people, animals and property. 
 Everyone is proud of the Tidy Village 
 award so pretty gardens surround well-
 maintained homes and farms.  But best 
 of all{good-neighbourliness}abounds   
 and happily without any of the age-gap
 barriers so often found today - just  
 stable Yorkshire friendship.          
{Of course this is my Utopia.          </content>
