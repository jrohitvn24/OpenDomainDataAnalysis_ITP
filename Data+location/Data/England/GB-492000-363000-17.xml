		<content>   Most children enjoy going to the    
 sports complex where they can enjoy   
 playing many sports as well as        
 watching films, roller skating and    
 'pop- mobility'.  The children also   
 play around on the Village Green where
 there are swings, roundabout and a    
 slide.  There is also a large hill    
 that has been made and the children   
 enjoy riding their bikes up and down  
 this. In the Winter then it is an     
 excellent sledging run.               
  The children enjoy a lot of freedom  
 to go off on bike rides during the    
 warmer weather when they often take a 
 drink and a small snack to eat. They  
 also play in the fields and along the 
 dykes making dens and fishing for     
 tadpoles.
