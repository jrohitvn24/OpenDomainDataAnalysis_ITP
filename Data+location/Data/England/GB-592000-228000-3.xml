		<content> In Fordham there is a Women's         
 Institute with 36 members. The        
 meetings are on the first Tuesday of  
 every month except January which is   
 the second Tuesday. They meet at      
 Fordham village hall.The time is      
 7.30pm to 10.00pm.When you are 13 you 
 are able to join the W.I. The         
 subscription is Â£4.00 a year plus 15p 
 for tea, coffee and a cake.The        
 officers are elected each year. W.I.'S
 take part in different things like    
 sponsored walks, bicycle rides, and   
 dances.Also they go on  outings.      
 Sometimes the W.I.holds a jumble sale 
 to raise money.At the beginning of    
 every meeting they have a business    
 talk about local and national         
 issues.This is followed by a visiting 
 speaker who comes in.Then they have   
 tea, coffee and cakes, and to end the 
 evening they have a game.             </content>
