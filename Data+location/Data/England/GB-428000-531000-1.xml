		<title>01FERRYHILL</title>
		<content> The Ferryhill area is typical of many 
 regions in North-East England.The area
 is now residential-agricultural but   
 was once a centre of mining and heavy 
 industry.                             
 In the 1960's the area contained two  
 large collieries at Dean and Chapter  
 (Ferryhill) and Mainsforth and a rail-
 way marshalling yard at Ferryhill     
 Station.These provided employment for 
 hundreds of people.By 1970 all were   
 closed.                               
 Now the only large industry within the
 region is a limestone-dolomite quarry.
 There are several small manufacturing 
 companies but they employ few workers 
 and a high unemployment rate is an    
 unfortunate feature of the region.
