		<title>01Highworth: An Introduction.</title>
		<content> Highworth lies 5 miles north of       
 Swindon in Wiltshire on the A361. The 
 older part of the town, centred around
 the High Street, contains buildings   
 with a wide variety of architectural  
 styles, light industry, and           
 residential areas. Much development   
 has taken place to the north of the   
 town since the 1960s, raising the     
 population of Highworth to over       
 10,000. Employment opportunities      
 have not risen with equal speed, and  
 the town acts as a dormitory          
 settlement to Swindon and relies      
 heavily on this town for services. To 
 the west of the region, on the B4019, 
 lies the small rural village of       
 Coleshill, set amidst the Wiltshire   
 farmland. This farming land is        
 dominated by arable use, with some    
 areas of pasture land.
