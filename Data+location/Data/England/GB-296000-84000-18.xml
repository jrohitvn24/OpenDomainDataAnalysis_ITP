		<content>The A376 dominates the block,running to
Exmouth from Exeter.This busy,commuter 
route,skirting the villages,runs       
parallel to the estuary.There is great 
pressure on this road during morning   
and evening rush-hours.Heavy lorries   
taking animal feed from Exmouth Docks  
add to the volume of traffic on this   
narrow,winding road.Trade in Exmouth   
Docks has greatly increased since      
1980 and there is little likelihood    
of the problem easing.                 
The Exmouth-Exeter line is a branch of 
the main Paddington-Penzance route.It  
runs right beside the estuary,giving   
lovely views which change with the tide
It was opened in 1861 and has been     
threatened with closure.The route is   
kept open by commuters and Marines.
