		<title>12Morwenstow - Festivals</title>
		<content> The  annual  Patronal Festival is held
 on St. John's Day, June 24th. Led by a
 band the children  march  behind their
 banner to a  Church service where they
 after  contribute. This ends with  the
 processional  hymn  'Onward  Christian
 Soldiers'.  Then  the  children   have
 sports at Crosstown, and a tea of sand
 wiches, cakes and splits with jam and 
 cream is served in the Martyn Room.   
 Evening events include; Adult Sports, 
 Clay Pigeon Shoot and Disco.          
 It is  believed that the first Harvest
 Festival  service was  held in Morwen-
 stow Church  last century by the Revd.
 R.S.Hawker.                           
 Harvest Thanksgiving services now take
 place  in  our  Church  and  Methodist
 Chapels and all over the world.       
 St Mark's schoolchildren think  of the
 harvest that is provided for  the wild
 animals in their service.             </content>
