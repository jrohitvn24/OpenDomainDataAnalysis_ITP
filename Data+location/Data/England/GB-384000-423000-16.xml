		<title>16Housing around Water</title>
		<content> Much of the housing is stone built    
 terraces with purple slate roofs      
 approximately 100 years old. There are
 many detail differences but the       
 commonest house is made from blocks of
 rough faced stone about 38cm long by  
 18cm high, laid in neat courses.      
 Usually there are two large windows at
 the front,about 115cm by 180cm, one on
 each storey, with painted wooden      
 frames. The door is wood, sometimes   
 with a pane of glass to allow more    
 light. Some houses have had the stone 
 cleaned by sandblasting, on the others
 is the black stain of pollution. The  
 mortar on these is picked out by a    
 light colour. A terraced house has    
 three rooms downstairs and a hall and 
 stairs,with two bedrooms upstairs and 
 a bathroom.
