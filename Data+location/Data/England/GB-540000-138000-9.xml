		<content> A day from my diary.                  
 I woke up at 7a.m. and after about 20 
 minutes I got up,washed,cleaned my    
 teeth ,dressed and went downstairs.I  
 had a boiled egg for breakfast and    
 then I fed Lulu my rabbit.            
 I arrived at school at 8.45 and took  
 my teacher's dog for a walk.After     
 assembly I went to see if I was good  
 enough to run in our area Sports.After
 play we saw a film "Tooth Care." It   
 told us what to eat and what not to.We
 were also given a tooth-brush, paste  
 and disclosing tablets. Before lunch  
 we had time for some handwriting prac-
 tice.After lunch we played "Stuck in  
 the Mud".In the afternoon we had to   
 catch up on Maths and English.        
 At home I had tea,watched television  
 and went to bed at about 8.45.
