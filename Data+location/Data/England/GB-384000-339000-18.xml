		<title>18Trentham Childrens Games - 1</title>
		<content>1. May I?  One child is chosen to give 
commands and the others form a team.   
The child giving the commands says     
something like, "John, take two hops   
forward." John cannot move without     
saying, "May I?". If he forgets he     
loses his turn. The first one across   
the line is the winner.                
2. Red Rover. Two teams face each      
other, holding hands. In turn, each    
team sings, "Red Rover, Red Rover, send
Peter (or any other childs name on the 
other team) straight over." Peter then 
has to run and break through the       
opposite line. If successful he returns
 to his team. If not, he joins the     
other team. The team with the most     
children at the end of the game wins.  
3. Tick. One child chases and has to   
touch anyone he can catch. This new    
child now has to chase the rest.
