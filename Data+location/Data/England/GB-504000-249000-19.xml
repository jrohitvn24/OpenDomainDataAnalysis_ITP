		<title>19THE WOODSIDE SHOPPING CENTRE</title>
		<content> The centre acts as a focal point for  
 trade and social activity within the  
 community.It has a Supermarket,Paper  
 shop,Green grocer,Butchers shop,DIY   
 shop and a Public house.It's designed 
 to provide for all the residents basic
 shopping needs without needing to     
 travel to the centre of town,about    
 three miles away.It also has a Health 
 Centre and good parking facilities.   
 There is a large area with raised     
 flower beds and seating.The attitudes 
 of local residents varied.Many thought
 it convenient and adequate for basic  
 needs but there was also a feeling    
 that it was untidy and in need of     
 better maintainance.
