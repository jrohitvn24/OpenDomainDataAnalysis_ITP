		<content>{St. George's, Wash Common }was built  
 between 1933 and 1965 and is run by 4 
 priests, who work as a team in 4      
 parishes.  Lay people assist in many  
 tasks like training people for Baptism
 and Confirmation, youth work and      
 leading prayer and study groups.  The 
 congregation comes from the area      
 between Speen and Highclere.  There   
 are 4 services on Sunday and special  
 celebrations at particular times, for 
 example Ascension Day, twin town      
 services and Patronal days.  30       
 Baptisms, 15 weddings and 20 funerals 
 took place last year.                 
{Conclusion.}Of the 4 Churches in the  
 area 2 were Church of England (Wash   
 Common and Newtown), 1 was Methodist, 
 and 1 was Roman Catholic. Most of the 
 local people do not regularly attend  
 any services, though traditionally    
 weddings etc. are still in church.    </content>
