 each other. If she succeeds her place 
 is then taken by the last person who  
 threw the ball.Skipping is also       
 popular.For this game you can have  as
 many people as you like.Two people    
 hold a piece of rope at each end and  
 they swing it round and round and the 
 other girls jump over the rope.
