		<title>16INGLEBY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Ingleby village is really a hamlet as 
 it only has fifteen houses,three      
 farms,and a public house.The people   
 who live there either work in the     
 village,in farming or the pub,"The    
 John Thompson",commute or are         
 retired.The village has no            
 centre,being situated along a country 
 road.there is no church,although there
 was once a chapel for the farm        
 workers.The property in the village is
 very popular because it is so close to
 Derby,and so is very expensive.The    
 village is on rich soil just above the
 flood plain of the river Trent.The    
 fields tend to be used main ly for    
 grazing,because of the risk of        
 floods.There are no modern buildings  
 in Ingleby,although the public house, 
 which brews its own beer,and is named 
 after its landlord,has been extended.
