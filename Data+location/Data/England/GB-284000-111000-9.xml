		<content> Houses fall into two types, older     
 stone and cob farmhouses and cottages,
 and recent houses and bungalows. Many 
 old farmhouses have a basic medieval  
 plan of cross-passage and two or three
 rooms which were originally open to   
 the roof. Chimneys, a first floor and 
 ceilings were gradually added.        
 Cottages, initially one-up one-down,  
 have been enlarged or combined to     
 provide better accommodation.         
 Originally thatched, most houses now  
 have slate roofs.                     
 The newer houses include council and  
 privately built homes. All the council
 houses are semi-detached, tenants are 
 buying some. Bungalows are privately  
 built, nearly all in Pennymoor in the 
 last 25 years.                        
 The Manor House is mainly Georgian but
 has a medieval core including an oak  
 panelled ceiling in the older part.   </content>
