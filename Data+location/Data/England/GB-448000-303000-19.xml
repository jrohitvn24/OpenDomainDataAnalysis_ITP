		<title>19Cardinal Matrix Broaches</title>
		<content> A group of us went to visit the       
 factory and it was very noisy because 
 there were lots of machines working.  
 The broaches are not brooches which   
 you wear but special tools.They are   
 drills which cut very unusual holes   
 and shapes into pieces of metal. Most 
 of the parts that the tools cut go    
 into cars and aeroplanes. The tools   
 are sent to factories all around the  
 world.

 A broach is a tool to make a difficult
 shaped hole.The factory is divided    
 into six areas and there are 11o      
 machines.They make 50 broaches per    
 week and 2,500 per year.Safety first  
 is very important.The men wear eye    
 shields,overalls,safety gloves and    
 boots.Only men work here. {Maria.
