 This a form of weaving done by hand on
 a special pillow (a circular hard wood
 base covered with calico and stuffed  
 with chopped straw to give a domed    
 appearance and the whole covered with 
 a smooth non-hairy fabric). The thread
 used is wound onto pairs of bobbins   
 and these are then manipulated to form
 patterns which are held in place by   
 pins. There are two lace makers in the
 area one of whom has become a teacher 
 and designer of lace and is also the  
 President of the North West Lace      
 Makers Association. She has designed a
 bedspread to be made of squares of    
 lace. The squares are at present being
 made by her students and when         
 completed the bedspread will be       
 exhibited at the Lace Guild Exhibition
 in 1986.                              </content>
