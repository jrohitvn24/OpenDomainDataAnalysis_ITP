		<title>11A VISIT TO SINFIN SUPERSTORE</title>
		<content> Fine Fare is the  name of our local   
 hypermarket,it has a sales area of    
 39,000 square feet. 13,000-15,000     
 customers visit a week and they have  
 about 230 lorry deliveries each week. 
 As you walk in the entrance straight  
 infront of you is the clothes         
 department. Behind the clothes        
 department are all the electrical     
 things like computer games and        
 televisions. There is a drinks        
 department that has every drink I     
 could name. At the back of the shop is
 a big long fridge, it had bacon,      
 sausages and lots of other things in. 
 Our school went into the cheese       
 department. The machine that cut the  
 cheese was sharp, there was also a    
 meat slicer in that room that was 35  
 years old. Up above is a cafe. We had 
 some orange drink and some bits of    
 pear from the fruit section. By Martyn</content>
