		<content> lambing, harvesting and spraying and  
 it is usually about nine o'clock when 
 he gets in.                           
    When I could not drive it was a    
 problem doing my shopping because     
 there is no bus, the only bus there   
 is, is the school bus which stops     
 about a quarter to eight and returns  
 at about four o'clock.                
    I love living here because of the  
 peace, the quietness and the privacy. 
 My husband and I prefer the country   
 life to urban life.                   
    The time in the farming year which 
 I dislike the most is harvest;        
 Alister,my husband gets up really     
 early and gets home very late."       
                                       
    This is how a typical farmer's wife
 lives.She is obviously happy and      
 contented in her job and where she    
 lives.                                </content>
