		<title>12Alfriston Village</title>
		<content> Alfriston is a small,pretty village.  
 It is well known for its connections  
 with smuggling and many of the houses 
 are said to have secret tunnels.      
                                       
 In the middle of the village there is 
 a huge chestnut tree and the stump of 
 a medieval market cross.              
                                       
 There are many shops in Alfriston     
 catering for the vast numbers of      
 tourists which visit each year. There 
 are antique shops,tea shops and an art
 gallery. Many of the buildings along  
 the High Street are timber framed     
 including the Smugglers Inn and the   
 Star Inn,which dates back to the 15th 
 Century.                              
                                       
 Behind the High Street is the Parish  
 Church and the River Cuckmere.
