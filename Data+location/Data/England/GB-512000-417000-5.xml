		<content> There are two pig farms in East       
 Halton and five farms with cattle.    
    Most of the cattle are bullocks    
 kept for fattening. There is one farm 
 which keeps cows for milk. The milking
 is done by electric milkers. The      
 breed kept for milking is Friesian. A 
 few people keep goats and chickens.   
 Most of the farmers have their own    
 cereal harvesters. The most popular   
 make is Massey Ferguson.              
    I live on a pig farm. My dad works 
 as a quantity surveyor and my mum runs
 the farm.I help a lot at harvest      
 time.                                 
    We have two Massey Ferguson        
 tractors on my farm. We use them for
