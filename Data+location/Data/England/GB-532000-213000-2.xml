		<content> The family have owned the{business}for
 eight years. There are nine full time 
 staff and seven part time. Saturday is
 their busiest day.                    
   The owner likes selling DIY products
 and chatting to customers.{Electrical 
{tools}are the most profitable goods.  
 Most is sold at holiday time. Business
 is good but there is competition with 
 DIY hypermarkets.                     
   In the{ironmongery}section there are
 screws, hinges and locks for windows, 
 cabinets and doors. There is a machine
 to cut keys. Customers prefer to buy  
 individual items rather than packs of 
 nails, hooks etc. The{paint mixing    
{machine}can mix 576 different colours.
   The{building}is 500 years old. The  
 oak beams came from old sailing ships 
 and are very hard from being in salt  
 water. It has a low decorated ceiling.
 When lorries go past, the shop shakes!</content>
