		<title>14THE SOUTH DOWNS</title>
		<content> The South Downs are in Sussex and are 
 chalk hills. They give a variety of   
 things to do and are a pleasure to    
 see. People climb to the top to enjoy 
 various activities. Picnics are one of
 the main things. Most people just walk
 up there to see the views of Sussex.  
 Some people go up there to sketch the 
 views of hills. People usually take   
 their hobbies such as scrambling on   
 bikes or sledging and skiing in winter
 when the South Downs are covered in a 
 white icing. Many schools go up there 
 to do their cross country. Many clubs 
 go up there to do horse riding and    
 hang gliding. Kite flying is again a  
 popular hobby for parents and         
 children. Not only do the people go   
 up there but birds enjoy it as well.  
 Rabbits are multiplying again and     
 traditional flowers such as the wild  
 orchid and cowslip are returning.     </content>
