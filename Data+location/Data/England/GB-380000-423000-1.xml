		<content> The area consists of hills used       
 predominantly for dairy{farming}and   
 rough grazing. New{housing}estates    
 fall within the{commuter belt}of      
 Greater Manchester.                   
 The village of{Crawshawbooth}is       
 situated three miles north of         
{Rawtenstall}in the{Rossendale}Valley  
 of Lancashire. The{village}has one    
 county primary school with 307        
 children on role and 12 full-time     
 teaching staff. 67 children from the  
 upper juniors have taken part in the  
 Domesday Project Activities, assessing
 land use in the area and making a     
 count of local amenities.             
 Visits have been made to buildings and
 places of interest and representatives
 from local organisations have been    
 interviewed. A questionnaire enabled  
 us to compile a picture of village    
 life.                                 </content>
