		<title>05THE COMMUNITY BUS</title>
		<content>   The Community Bus is a 'free' bus   
 that runs every Thursday. It takes    
 people from Mottram St. Andrew and    
 Newton to Wilmslow and Alderley Edge. 
 It leaves Mottram at 10.30 am and     
 returns from Alderley Edge in the     
 early afternoon. The 'free' bus is    
 paid for by the Wright's Trust using  
 money left in a will.                 
   On 11th July, 1985 Gail Rowbotham   
 and Rosemarie Owen carried out a      
 survey of people using the bus. Ten   
 people got on at Mottram and three    
 people and one baby got on at Newton. 
 Four people got off at Wilmslow and   
 the rest got off at Alderley Edge. All
 the people went shopping. Everybody   
 except one used the bus nearly every  
 week. Over half of the people did not 
 have the use of a car so the bus was  
 very important to them.               
 by Gail Rowbotham and Rosemarie Owen. </content>
