		<title>14RAILWAY AND CANAL TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> A short stretch of the Leeds and      
 Liverpool canal runs through the Aire 
 valley below Horsforth alongside the  
 river and railway.Three locks at      
 Newlay lift the canal level 8metres.At
 Rodley there is a swing bridge and a  
 boat centre.A Marina exists at        
 Newlay on the canal side. There are   
 two                                   
 "winding points"where the barges can  
 be turned round.                      
 Horsforth has railways passing it on  
 two sides-the old LNER line which     
 originally ran from Leeds to          
 Harrogate and beyond and the old LMR  
 running alongside the River Aire and  
 canal.Both lines were in use in 1848  
 though the station at Newlay was      
 axed in the 1960's.The railway        
 passing through our block grid is     
 still the main west route from Leeds  
 to Carlisle and Glasgow via Settle.   </content>
