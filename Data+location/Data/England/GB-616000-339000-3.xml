		<content>  The village has lost a shop, public  
 house and bus service over the last 20
 years.  A shop and post office on the 
 A148 are used for some provisions.  A 
 mobile shop, baker, butcher, fish van,
 and mobile library visit the village  
 regularly, but the majority of people 
 travel to Cromer or Sheringham for    
 most of their{shopping. }             
  The lack of{bus services}- there are 
 two buses a week which pass through   
 the village - mean that most people   
 use their own car when shopping. {Car 
{ownership}is high in the working      
 age-groups.                           
 The{Primary School}closed in 1978, and
 children travel to Gresham by school  
 bus.  Other services are only found   
 outside the village.  71% of those    
 interviewed visit a{doctor}in Cromer  
 (21% Sheringham), 67% visit a{dentist}
 in Cromer (24% Sheringham).           </content>
