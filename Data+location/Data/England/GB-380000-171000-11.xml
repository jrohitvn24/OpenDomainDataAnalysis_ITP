		<title>11Modern Housing</title>
		<content> Housing in the village of Colerne has 
 increased steadily during the last    
 forty years . Several new developments
 have been built parallel to the       
 High Street . The main part of the    
 village has been declared a           
 Conservation Area and any new plans or
 houses have to be approved by         
 the local council .                   
                                       
 One new house in the village has      
 created particular interest. the house
 is in Watergates. It was designed to  
 look like a converted farmhouse,and   
 great care and consideration was taken
 into making it energy saving. The     
 outer walls are three layers thick to 
 keep the heat in. The design of the   
 house ensures that even in winter the 
 sunlight will help to heat the        
 interior.
