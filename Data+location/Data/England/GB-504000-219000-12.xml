		<title>12ENTERTAINMENT NETBALL LUTON</title>
		<content>Every Tuesday at 6.30pm I leave my     
house for netball and go down to Old   
Bedford Rd. to the Recreation Centre.  
We have a game of netball for an hour. 
I play either GA or GD (goal attack or 
goal defence). After a game of netball 
we play around and play other games to 
help us get better at netball. We have 
matches on Thursdays, we have a match  
next week but I won't be there because 
I am going on holiday. We will carry on
playing netball through the holidays   
right through until the winter. We are 
called the 'Farley Fliers' and when we 
win a match we are on Chiltern Radio   
because the transport managers husband 
works there, and we might be in the    
Herald newspaper.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
