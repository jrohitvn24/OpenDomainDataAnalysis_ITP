		<content> The main crop grown is grass, covering
 90% of the area. Half is for grazing, 
 half is conserved for winter feed, 95%
 as silage, 5% as hay. Up to 3 cuts of 
 silage are made annually. 300 tonnes  
 of straw are imported each year from  
 other areas for fodder and bedding.   
 Sheep remain out all year apart from a
 short period before and after lambing.
 Cows and bullocks are housed          
 throughout the wet, cold winters.     
 Large, airy buildings of concrete     
 block or wood with roofs of asbestos  
 sheeting have replaced the small dark 
 cob hovels. They have wide central    
 passageways and doorways enabling     
 tractors to enter with equipment; dump
 fodder and bedding and remove dung.   
 Machinery is stored under high-roofed 
 open-sided structures. A few large old
 stone barns remain and are used for   
 storage of hay, seeds and equipment.  </content>
