		<title>17THE RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> The reservoir is near Brodsworth      
 Colliery, and supplies water to       
 Woodlands and Adwick. Along time ago  
 water from the pit was mixed with     
 water taken from artesian wells deep  
 below the ground.The pit water was    
 very hard with deposits of calcium    
 carbonate.This water was softened in  
 the water tower.The lime that was left
 over was pumped into lime pits nearby 
 and left to settle.The lime was       
 skimmed off and sold to farmers to    
 spread on their pastures to improve   
 the quality of the grass.No water is  
 used from the pit now.All the water is
 purified with chlorine before it is   
 pumped into the domestic water supply.
