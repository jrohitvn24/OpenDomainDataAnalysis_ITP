		<title>16ROAD STRUCTURE IN TADLEY</title>
		<content> One of the greatest sources of anger, 
 both in Tadley and the rural areas, is
 the ever increasing amount of traffic.
 In Tadley there has been a great deal 
 of housing development but very little
 thought given to road planning, with  
 many of the estates having poor access
 to the busy main road. While in the   
 country, narrow, winding lanes are    
 unable to cope with all the heavy     
 local traffic going to the AWRE mixing
 with commuter traffic. In Tadley and  
 in the country there are cries for    
 more speed limits and for the         
 enforcement of those that already     
 exist. The police say that this is    
 impossible, and that the very nature  
 of many of the roads should prevent   
 excessive speeding. Residents know    
 that this is not true.
