		<title>13ACTIVITIES AT HOLY CROSS</title>
		<content> Each day we start with half an hour of
{silent reading.}Then at 9.30 a.m. we  
 have{assembly,}where the whole school 
 congregates -there is normally a      
 reading followed by a prayer and a    
 song. Assembly lasts for about 15     
 minutes.                              
 From this period, until 3.15 p.m. all 
 curriculum acticities are taught by   
 the class teacher.                    
 Apart from the general curriculum,    
 there is{swimming}during the summer - 
 we have our own learners swimming pool
 in the grounds. There are also        
 activities after school -{football;   
{netball;gymnastics;bird watching; and 
{canoeing.                             
 At the present time we have one       
{computer}(a single disk-drive ; VDU;  
 and printer ) - so the 4th years have 
 use of it for 1 and 1/2 terms after   
 which the 3rd years will also use it. </content>
