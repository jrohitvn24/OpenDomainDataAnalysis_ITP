		<title>08  Worlebury hill fort</title>
		<content>   Worlebury hill fort lies in Weston  
 woods and can be easily reached from  
 Kewstoke road. Today the ruined outer 
 walls can still be seen as well as    
 finds now in Woodspring museum.       
   Iron age man chose to settle on     
 Worlebury hill for a number of        
 reasons.At the top of the hill they   
 had a good view and would be able to  
 see their enemies coming. The land was
 good for growing crops and they could 
 go fishing in the sea.                
   The hill used to be surrounded by a 
 large stone wall. It would have kept  
 out wolves and enemies. Inside the    
 walls were huts. These were round with
 wattle and daub walls and thatched    
 roofs.There was a small door and a    
 fire in the middle of the room.Iron   
 age man would have spent his day      
 ploughing, sewing, weeding, harvesting
 and threshing.They also kept animals. </content>
