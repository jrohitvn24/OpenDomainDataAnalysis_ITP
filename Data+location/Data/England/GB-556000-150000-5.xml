		<title>05Rare Farm Animal Sanctuary</title>
		<content> Mr Brooks has recently opened the Rare
 Farm Animal Sanctuary at Great        
 Hollanden,Hildenborough.Mr Joe Henson 
 originally thought of the idea and Mr 
 Brooks liked it.It took 3 years to    
 build the Sanctuary and to get 60 rare
 breeds of animals.The aim of this     
 centre is to preserve rare species,it 
 is a home for over 100 animals.Mr     
 Brooks put a huge amount of effort    
 into finding the animals,he travelled 
 the length of Britain.                
 The animals are kept in large en_     
 closures in what was an arable field  
 last year.Here are some of the rare   
 breeds:shaggy highland cattle,        
 Hebridean sheep,Anglo-Nubian goats,   
 Bagot goats,Eriskay ponies and Welsh  
 belted black cattle.Many of these     
 animals could soon be extint.
