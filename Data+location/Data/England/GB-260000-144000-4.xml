		<content>     The area is poorly served by      
 public transport.   The Combe         
 Martin/Barnstaple bus runs from C M   
 via A399 to Easterclose where it turns
 off onto B3229.  There is one bus each
 way on Tuesdays and Fridays.          
                                       
      In the summer there is an        
 additional Coastal bus which runs     
 from Ilfracombe to Lynton/Lynmouth via
 the A399.  A local coach firm runs    
 many coach trips along the route and  
 onto Exmoor during the season.        
                                       
      Most of the houses are a         
 considerable distance from a bus stop 
 and also from the village shops and   
 Post Offices at Kentisbury and        
 Parracombe so a car would seem to be a
 necessity except for the very active.
