		<title>15EVENTS_THE CHARTER FAIR 1985</title>
		<content>   The Charter Fair is held to         
 celebrate when Northleach was given a 
 charter, when it was a big wool town. 
 The square was busy the night before  
 when everything was getting ready. The
 day's main events were in the playing 
 fields with a car boot sale sale and  
 other stalls. There was a carnival, a 
 motorbike display, a human bomb, and a
 clown. The best part of the fair was  
 the disco and the events in the       
 evening. The first event was the      
 wellie walk where teams of 4 wearing  
 wellies tied together visited each pub
 and drank a pint of beer at each. A   
 big disco was held in the square with 
 music played off the back off a lorry.
 There was also a country and western  
 band for some of the time. The fair   
 went on for most of the night. It was 
 brilliant.
