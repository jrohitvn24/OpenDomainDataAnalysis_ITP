		<content> The Feast of Saint Wilfrid            
 The feast of St.Wilfrid originated in 
 a charter granted by King Henry 1st to
 Thomas Archbishop of York in 1108 and 
 was a fair for four days in April.Now 
 it is held in July/August and is      
 extended by a fortnight.              
  The main part of the feast is on the 
 Saturday before the first Monday in   
 August and celebrates the return of   
 St.Wilfrid from exile in 686.Two      
 Hundred years ago it was customary for
 someone representing St.Wilfrid to be 
 taken away the day before the         
 procession and be brought back on the 
 appointed day.                        
  Clubs,schools,shops,local firms and  
 public houses all build floats on     
 various themes,eg,Robin Hood,nursery  
 rhymes,the wild west and the good old 
 days.The best float that is built     
 recieves a prize.                     </content>
