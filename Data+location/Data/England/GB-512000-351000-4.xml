		<title>04SANDPIT FARM,NORTH KYME</title>
		<content> We visited{Sandpit Farm}owned by Mr.  
 C.Dring. His family have farmed 205   
 acres since 1898 and the land is      
 called{Black Fen land}and is drained  
 into{Anwick Fen Drain.}At the farm    
 they have 5 tractors and 11 sheds.In  
 one of the sheds they store potatoes. 
 There is a fan which keeps the        
 potatoes cool and stops them from     
 rotting. In a new shed they keep      
 tractors called Internationals and a  
 beet drill, trailer, a combine bed, a 
 wheat drill and a beet hoe for the    
 front of the tractor. There is a      
 corndrier which holds 300 tonnes. Then
 we went in the Combine shed which had 
 160 tonnes of grain and a combine.    
 Then we went in the crewyard which had
 a plough and some chitting boxws in.  
 Mr. Dring has 17 fields in which are  
 grown potatoes, wheat, sugar beet and 
 barley.                               </content>
