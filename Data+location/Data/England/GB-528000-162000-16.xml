		<title>16The Crown Court Wallington</title>
		<content>The Crown Court was made into a court  
in 1980. It had been a town hall which 
had been opened in 1935 by Sir Richard 
Meller. The court got one award from   
The Times newspaper. Most of the court-
rooms had no windows except for one.   
They select the jury from outside and  
can be male or female. They have to be 
from the age of 18 to 65 years old.    
They also have a shorthand writer. If  
he misses a bit he can see the mistakes
he made by listening to a tape record- 
ing. All of the court rooms were very  
bright and had lots of light. One of   
the courtrooms had an emblem saying    
"DIEU ET MON DROIT." There is a piece  
of paper for the witness which says    
"Address your judge as your honour     
and please speak up."
