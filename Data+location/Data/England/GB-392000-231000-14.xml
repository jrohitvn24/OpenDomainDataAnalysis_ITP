		<title>14A Day in my Life</title>
		<content> I live in Aston on Carrant in the     
 country. When I wake up in the morning
 I can hear the birds and I sometimes  
 hear a cuckoo. Then my mum comes and  
 wakes me up. When I have washed, daddy
 who hasn't gone to work yet often sees
 the race horses gallop along the      
 field.There's a lot of panic in the   
 mornings but when we get to school    
 mummy  says goodbye.At school we do   
 lots of writing and maths.At school we
 can have either school dinners or     
 sandwiches. I have sandwiches and go  
 on second sitting.When I get home I go
 up to my bedroom and watch the rabbits
 and I sometimes see some pheasants.My 
 house is very big and I have a very   
 big garden.I have a racer bike and go 
 haring around the garden with my      
 sister Nicole.There is a lorry depot  
 called Warner's up our lane but it is 
 still very peaceful.                  </content>
