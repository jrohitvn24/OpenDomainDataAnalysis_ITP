		<content> Penrith has a problem which has caused
 the people of the town to write at    
 somelength to the local newspaper.    
 This is not a reent problem, it has   
 been going on for many years, although
 the ned to write to the newspaper has 
 hot less and less.  The problem - "The
 Smell".  The smell comes from         
 Wildriggs which is localy known as    
 'The bone factory'.  It is the place  
 where anything that can be used from  
 dead carcassses is processed into     
 animal products.  In the past the     
 prevaling south West wind would give  
 the inhabitants of the town the full  
 benifit of 'The Smell'.  Now due to   
 the efforts of Wildriggs the smell    
 escapes very rarely, but when it does,
 it still prompts letter to the locl   
 paper, as it is still a matter of     
 concern.                              
                                       </content>
