{Brownies.}                            
  Another group which uses the         
 school as their base is the local     
 Brownie-Pack.This is a thriving group 
 of twenty-four girls who are provided 
 with an interesting and varied        
 programme of activities.Because of the
 demand, a Girl-Guide group is being   
 contemplated.                         
{Brass-Band.                           
  In common with many mining areas     
 there is a local Brass-Band. This is  
 made up of people from the immediate  
 locality as well as from much further 
 afield.The band includes many young   
 people,some barely teenagers.         
  As with the Garden-Shows,rivalry     
 amongst Bands is high and consequently
 Band conductors are engaged from both 
 near and far.An annual Band-Contest is
 held as part of the Miner's Gala.     </content>
