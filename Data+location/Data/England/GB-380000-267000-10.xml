		<content>{Bishops Wood}water tower a local land-
 mark, can be seen from all around. The
 26m high reinforced concrete reservoir
 with a diameter of 12-5m, stands on a 
 stem (2-7m internal diameter) and     
 holds 455 cubic meters (100,000 gals.)
 approx. 1 days water supply for the   
 area. A reinforced concrete roof stops
 rain water and other forms of polluti-
 on contaminating the drinking water.  
 The now{Severn Trent Water Authority  
 built it in 1971, the elevation of the
 site enabling the water supply to flow
 by gravity. A borehole pumping station
 at Worsley 2KM away supplies the      
 water. Thought was given to make its  
 appearance compatible with its        
 surroundings.The area itself is the   
 subject of a "Tree Preservation Order"
 and so care was taken during building 
 to avoid damage to certain Oak and    
 Silver Birch trees. (M.Dickson)       </content>
