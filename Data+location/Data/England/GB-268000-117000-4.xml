		<title>04TRANSPORT, KING'S NYMPTON</title>
		<content> The most common form of transport is  
 by private car. Motor bikes are       
 popular with young people and allow   
 them cheap travel to work and         
 entertainment. Bicycles are used by   
 children and school leavers who work  
 locally.  Steep hills leading to the  
 village discourage their use. No form 
 of nationalised transport exists and  
 the few bus services are run by       
 private contractors.There is a weekly 
 bus to South Molton on Thursdays,which
 is Market Day.On Fridays there are    
 services to Barnstaple and Exeter.    
 Children coming to the local school   
 from outlying farms may travel on     
 school buses and the public may also  
 use these buses.In June 1985 a local  
 group set up a minibus service to     
 South Molton twice daily.On Sundays   
 this bus makes a hospital visiting run
 to The North Devon District Hospital. </content>
