		<content> There is a small abattoir behind the  
 village butcher belonging to          
 G.Homewood and Son. It is used on     
 Tuesday afternoon when they kill      
 mainly bullocks, sheep and pigs. About
 20 animals are killed and they come   
 from local farms or the Ashford Cattle
 Market. The animals are killed with a 
 bolt gun called CashX which fires a   
 retractable bolt into the animals     
 head. Pigs are then put into a        
 Scalder-dehairer which removes the    
 hairs. The meat is left to hang in a  
 cool room overnight then put into cold
 storage. Beef is left for two weeks   
 before being sold in the village shop.
 The hides go to make leather and the  
 bones and hooves for glue.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
