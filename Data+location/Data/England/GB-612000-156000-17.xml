		<title>17Religion in Canterbury (1)</title>
		<content>   Canterbury has a rich heritage of   
 religious associations dating back to 
 beyond the time of St.Augustine in the
 sixth century A.D.                    
                                       
   Not only the{Cathedral}but also the 
 many{churches}which flourish in the   
 city bear witness to the{Christian}   
 significance of the City.Many of the  
 older churches are to be found within 
 the original flint walls of the       
 Mediaeval City but others are to be   
 found at historically important sites 
 within the city and forming an        
 integral part of its environment.     
                                       
   All the major{denominations}can be  
 found in the City. A special council, 
 the Canterbury Christian Council, is  
 helping to bring nearer the day when  
 Christians everywhere will join in    
 united worship.                       </content>
