		<content> As most of the area lies within the   
 Peak District National Park there are 
 restrictions protecting the ecology   
 of the area.  This ensures a high     
 degree of awareness towards general   
 aspects of conservation.              
   Access to the area is limited mainly
 to ramblers, and long-distance walkers
 who are served by the Pennine Way     
 (Alternative Route).  The threat of   
 extensive footpath erosion, has been  
 averted by a planned fencing project  
 keeping walkers to set routes.        
   Further dangers are presented by    
 excessive drainage eroding the peat   
 bogs.  This has been greatly reduced  
 by water catchment canals constructed 
 by Yorkshire Water Authority.  Such   
 works plus careful construction of the
 reservoirs aid the maintenance of     
 conservation in this region.          
   Pollution was a problem in the past.</content>
