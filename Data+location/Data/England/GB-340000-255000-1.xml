		<title>01Farm land round Lower Burton</title>
		<content> Like its neighbour to the west, this  
 block is agricultural and thinly      
 populated.  There are few new houses, 
 since planning permission is almost   
 impossible to obtain in rural areas.  
 All farms practise mixed agriculture. 
 Hops are grown at Henwood and Bidney. 
 Pedigree Hereford cattle bred nearby  
 at Haven are grazed on Henwood        
 meadows.  burton Court, mentioned in  
 the first Doomsday book, is a family  
 home, housing an exhibition of        
 oriental and European costumes and    
 natural history, and open to the      
 public in the summer.  Its lands are a
 soft fruit farm.  Henwood, the other  
 large house in the block, is privately
 occupied but its lands are all let.   
 The block is crossed in the south by  
 the main  Leominster/Hay road, a busy 
 one by north Hereford standards but   
 comparatively quiet by most standards.</content>
