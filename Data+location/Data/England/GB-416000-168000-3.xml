		<title>03NEW HOUSING IN MARLBOROUGH</title>
		<content> Marlborough Borough Council, Kennet   
 District Council and a local building 
 firm called Rendells have collaborated
 in a successful joint venture. Small  
 houses, often referred to as "starter 
 homes" were built on the eastern edge 
 of a council estate called Portfields,
 and were occupied in the first six    
 months of 1984. Those eligible for    
 this scheme (called Roger's Meadow)   
 were:                                 
                                       
   a) already living in a council      
 house,                                
                                       
   b) on the waiting list or           
                                       
  c) a first time buyer already living 
 in Marlborough. Sanctions in respect  
 of re-sale and extensions were        
 imposed.
