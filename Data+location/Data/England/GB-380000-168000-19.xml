       {Box}is well served by          
 roads.With the{A4}and the{A365}passing
 though the village.Although 3 bus     
 services stop in the village there are
 many other services which merely pass 
 through.The congestion and traffic,   
 especially along the{A4}make the      
 centre of{box}a noisy place.A main    
 railway line also runs though the     
 village but the station was closed    
 several years ago. Because of poor    
 standard of public transport there has
 been a vast increase in the number of 
 private vehicles in the village.The   
 poor parking facilities and double    
 yellow lines have aggravated the      
 situation. Like many other places an  
 improved bus service would solve the  
 problem of living outside an urban    
 area.                                 </content>
