		<content>  Most of the land is tough{grazing    
{land},but some is ploughed to grow    
 barley to feed the animals in winter. 
{Mixed farming}This is a mixture of    
 cattle and sheep.The numbers vary     
 because the farmers might get more    
 sheep than cows or vice versa.Some    
 mixed farms may have young bullocks   
 and sell them fat.Some farmers make   
 silage for cows in winter and a little
 hay for calves.The silage is made into
 large round bales.{Dairy cows }Out of 
 7 farms marked on our map 3 do dairy  
 cattle and 1 has a milk round.{Beef   
{cattle }Some cattle are kept only to  
 breed calves to sell for beef. {Sheep.
 The most popular breeds are Swaledale 
 and Herdwick.The lambs are weaned in  
 October.The ewes are tupped about     
 December and January.
