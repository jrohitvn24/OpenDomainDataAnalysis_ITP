 MY FAMILY AND HOME by Sharon Mobbs    
 I have 3 younger sisters at school and
 a baby brother. We live in the hamlet 
 of Bittesby where there are only 6    
 houses. My Grandma lives in Bittesby  
 too. My Father works on a farm and Mum
 stays at home to look after the family
 - she can not drive. Because we live a
 few miles from school we have to cacth
 the school-bus at 8.30am every morning
