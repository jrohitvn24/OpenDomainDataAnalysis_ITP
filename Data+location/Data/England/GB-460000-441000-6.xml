		<content> We questioned Mr.Skilbeck about       
 farming in our area.As well as a dairy
 herd he and his brother keep beef     
 cattle which are either sold at Murton
 Livestock Centre for beef,or sold to  
 the local wholesale butcher,who has an
 abbatoir.Most of the farms locally are
 arable,growing mainly sugar beet (for 
 British Sugar Corportion),barley,wheat
 and potatoes.The most noticeable      
 change of late has been in the growing
 of high yielding,winter sown cereals, 
 such as barley,harvested in late July,
 and wheat,harvested in late August.In 
 1985 there was an appeal called the   
 Great Grain Trail organised by the    
 N.F.U. for the starving in Ethopia.   
 40,000 tons of grain were donated by  
 farmers in the region,who also covered
 the cost of its transport to Hull     
 docks.
