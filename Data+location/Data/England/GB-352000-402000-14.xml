		<title>14WINSTANLEY-A New Estate</title>
		<content> The aim of the original pre-war plan  
 for the development of the area,the   
 "{WINSTANLEY NEIGHBOURHOOD UNIT}",was 
 to house 40,000 people in a region    
 which was then mainly farms and woods 
 with some mine-workings,including open
 -cast sites.                          
                                       
 After the land had been allowed to    
 settle development began in 1958 and  
 continued through the 60's, 70's and  
 into the 80's.                        
                                       
 Today Winstanley is still growing and 
 is a popular residential estate.      
                                       
 A retired gentleman who has lived in  
 the area for over 60 years states:"The
 changes are welcome.I prefer social   
 life to solitude every time."         
                                       
                                       </content>
