		<title>06Employment in Nailsea</title>
		<content> By far the greater majority of people 
 of the working population in Nailsea  
 work outside Nailsea, mostly in       
 Bristol. There are two small light    
 industrial estates in Nailsea, one of 
 which, the{West End}or{Blackfriars    
{Road Estate,}is in our survey area.   
 The first firm on this site was the   
 Blackfriars Paint Company, whose      
 premises were built over the remains  
 of an old coal-mine known as Grace's  
 Pit or 60 Fathoms or,later, West End  
 Colliery.                             
 Most of the other firms on the site   
 are small businesses set up in the    
 last 10 to 15 years. Two bigger firms 
 have premises on the estate, Sonnet   
 Kitchens and Brabantia Furniture, but 
 these are just distribution depots.   
 Therefore, there are not many         
 employment opportunities on this site.
