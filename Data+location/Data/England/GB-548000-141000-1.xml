		<content>  Area comprised of wooded hills and   
 valleys sloping down to the R Eden in 
 NE corner &amp; the R Medway in the SE.   
 The rivers rise on Ashdown forest &amp;   
 flood quickly after heavy rain.The    
 slopes are woodland &amp; grass for cattle
 &amp; sheep on shallow topsoil over       
 sandstone. Two slopes support a       
 succesful vineyard. There are outcrops
 of sandstone on the wooded hills.     
 Plantations of sweet chestnut &amp;       
 conifers were until recently owned by 
 the Hever estate &amp; maintained for     
 pheasant rearing for shooting. Now    
 becoming over grown they are          
 increasingly overrun by vermin. There 
 are many well used footpaths. Old     
 timber framed houses with tile hanging
 over wattle &amp; daub are dotted         
 throughout the area which is          
 designated of outstanding natural     
 beauty.                               </content>
