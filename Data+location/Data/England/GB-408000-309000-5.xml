		<title>05 Greenhill Bower</title>
		<content>     Every year there is a procession  
held in Lichfield called the Greenhill 
Bower. It was originally held for men  
of Lichfield to show their armour and  
weapons. At the end of the day they had
fun at the fair.                       
     Nowadays, the Bower is in three   
parts, the procession, the fair and the
horse show. The procession is very     
exciting. It is made up of lots of     
floats, which are decorated by local   
people. The leading float carries the  
Bower Queen and her attendants, the    
Bower Prince and Princess. For the last
four years the Bower Princess has come 
from our school.                       
      A big fair comes with stalls and 
rides and some of the central streets  
are closed to hold it. The horse show  
is made up of show and jumping classes.
