 The major activity is dairy farming   
 which includes intensive grazing and  
 cattle breeding. Associated crops     
 include mangols, fodder beet, silage  
 and hay. Market crops are potatoes,   
 broccoli, turnips, corn and one       
 greenhouse centre produces tomatoes,  
 runner beans, french beans, peppers,  
 courgettes and various horticultural  
 products.  These products are         
 transported to markets as far afield  
 as Bristol. Apart from one large      
 holding of over 1000 acres most farms 
 are under 150 acres.  The largest farm
 which totals 1900 acres, 700 of which 
 is woodland also rears over 2000      
 sheep.  In the season New Zealanders  
 are brought over to shear these sheep.
 A major problem is that of unrealistic
 milk quotas and unreliable weather.
