		<title>05St John the Baptist Church</title>
		<content> Our village church is called{St. John 
{the Baptist.}It is much larger than   
 the one the Normans built.{In 1086    
{when the first Domesday survey was    
{done, there was a mill on the site.   
{The Normans built a small stone church
 with rounded arches.{In 1863 the old  
{church was pulled down.}The presnt one
 is larger. The church has stained and 
 clear glass windows. I like the       
 stained glass window at the front of  
 the church high in the wall by the    
 door. It shows a dove.{A dove is a    
{sign of peace and love.}Dove are birds
 of peace because they are in a lot of 
 Bible stories.{They were in the story 
{of Noah's Ark.                        
{The roof on the outside of the church 
{is made of red clay}tiles.Inside the  
 church the roof has got wooden        
 rafters.The rafters make semi_circles 
 and{triangles.JO WRIGHT CHARLIE COOPER</content>
