		<title>15Landscape Chaldon Hills</title>
		<content> The natural landscape is dominated by 
 rolling downland ridges with dry,     
 former river valleys between.         
 One ridge runs East/West along the    
 Southern boundary of the block and    
 rises to a maximum height of 166      
 metres above sea level. Five ridges,  
 with valleys between them run         
 North/South.                          
 Downland ridges have been rounded by  
 erosion and soil cover over the       
 underlying chalk is very thin.        
 Therefore what few trees and hedges do
 grow are very stunted and their shape 
 is further distorted by the prevailing
 South Westerly winds.                 
 In contrast the valley floors are     
 fertile and support more abundant     
 growth such as the ancient Marley     
 Wood.Other than the steeper valley    
 sides, used as grazing and woodland,  
 the remainder is used for cultivation.</content>
