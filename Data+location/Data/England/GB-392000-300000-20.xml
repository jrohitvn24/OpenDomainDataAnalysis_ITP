		<content>My name is Satvir Kaur Dhalwal. I live 
in Wednesfield. I am a Sikh and my     
language is Punjabi. My father is      
leader of our family but my mother runs
the house. To show respect to my       
grandparents I must speak Punjabi. I   
speak two languages. One of them is    
English and the other is my own        
language. At home I sometimes speak    
Punjabi and sometimes English. My      
mother and father speak good English   
and other languages too. It is always  
polite to answer people in the language
that the question is asked - Punjabi   
with Punjabi and English with English. 
I am now going to Saturday school to   
learn to read and write Punjabi.I also 
have extra Punjabi lessons at my school
in Wednesfield.
