 villages in the {Eden Valley.}It is   
 dominated by a hill on which once     
 stood the medieval {Harcla Castle.}   
 It has 36 houses and about 100        
 inhabitants. Many professional people 
 retire here.{Hartley Beck}flows beside
 its one street. On weekdays wagons go 
 through{Hartley}to the limestone      
 quarry nearby, but on Sundays the     
 village is very quiet. There are no   
 shops in the village nor any meeting  
 place. An occasional dance or rally   
 has been held in a barn at{Hartley    
{Fold Farm.}This year the seven a side 
 football team won the Waitby Cup. Many
 walkers go through {Hartley }on their 
 way to{Nine Standards,}nine huge      
 cairns built on the skyline. The Coast
 to Coast walk also passes through the 
 village.
