		<title>04Farming near Landscove</title>
		<content> The cattle are reared for their milk  
 and meat,the sheep for their wool and 
 lambs meat.{Farming }in the area is   
 made more difficult by the steep      
 slopes where it is dangerous to use   
 big machines.                         
      {Cider}has been produced since   
 very early times and many of the      
 farmers have a few acres of apple     
 trees. Mr.Savage sends an average of  
 45 tons to Mr.Hill each year for cider
 making.                               
       {Cereal}production is mostly in 
 the form of barley ,used for animal   
 feed and the malting of beer.Some     
 wheat is grown for bread and baking   
 .The grain not sold here goes abroad  
 through the{grain}terminal at         
 Teignmouth or Exmouth.                
         There are 14 farms here  which
 mostly belong to the Church           
 Commissioners.                        </content>
