		<content> We have three christian churches in   
 Lapford,with a fourth also represented
 locally.The{Parish church}is dedicated
 to ST Thomas of canterbury,and parts  
 of the building date from 1170, the   
 rest from 1480.The finest features    
 are the beautifully carved wooden     
 screen of 1520 and the bench ends of  
 the same date.The church stands at the
 village centre beside a well_ kept    
 green.About forty people attend       
 services each sunday,with twenty      
 children in the sunday school.The {   
{Christian Brethren}are the strongest  
 denomination,with about sixty people  
 worshipping regularly in the          
 village.There is a {Congregational}   
 church built in 1800,and about 30     
 people attend services each Sunday    
 school.
