		<content> Our block is in West Cumbria by the   
 Solway Firth.There are three villages.
 Flimby,Siddick and Seaton.Flimby a    
 rather large village is very near the 
 sea and consists mostly of old houses,
 shops and farms with a large mixed    
 wood.                                 
    Siddick, a rather untidy village   
 has most of its houses boarded up.    
 With only 4 streets it's the smallest 
 village.                              
 Seaton is mostly council houses with  
 an estate and a shopping area at one  
 end.There are a few live stock        
 farms.With all this it's the biggest  
 village.                              
    The rail way line is mostly used   
 for communication.It is kept open by  
 taking factory goods.                 
    The shore is in danger of pollution
 from Nuclear waste.Most of the of     
 shore is stony .                      </content>
