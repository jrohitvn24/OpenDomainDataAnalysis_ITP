		<title>16Hunting,Lorton/Whinlatter</title>
		<content>   Just outside Lorton are the{kennels 
 where the{Melbreak Hunt}keep their    
 dogs.It is a{fell pack,}which means it
 is lead{on foot}by the{hunts-man,}who 
 also lives at the kennels.            
   The{season}starts after the third   
 Thursday in{September,}when the dogs  
 are brought to Loweswater Show.They   
 hunt from then until the end of       
{lambing season,}when the dogs are     
 returned to their owners for the      
 summer.                               
   There are 43{hounds}and 4{terriers. 
 They hunt{three times a week,}but if  
 the scent is poor,due to bad weather, 
 they don't always catch a fox.In the  
 84/85 season,{59 foxes}were killed.   
   The Melbreak covers an area from    
 Buttermere to Cockermouth and from    
 Whinlatter across to Ennerdale,       
 although this is the{smallest district
 of any of the{six}Lakeland fell packs.</content>
