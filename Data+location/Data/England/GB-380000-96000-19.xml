		<content> History of the School.  The original  
 school was built  on the site of the  
 old Tithe Barn and pond, by the Rev.  
 James Michael of Whatcombe House and  
 formally Vicar of Sturminster Newton. 
 He married a Pleydell, heiress of the 
 Moreton Pleydells.  On the wall of the
 school was a tablet stating the school
 was built in 1859, but when the school
 porch was built by J.C. Mansel        
 Pleydell, nephew of the Rev. J.       
 Michael the tablet was removed.  The  
 school mistress appointed in 1859 was 
 Mrs. Eliza Virram, assisted by two    
 teachers.  Mr. Maidment was appointed 
 as the first School Master in 1868.   
 Milborne School became a first tier   
 school under the re-organisation      
 programme of the 1980's.  On leaving  
 Milborne School the children go to    
 Puddletown Middle School then on to   
 Dorchester Upper Schools when 13.     </content>
