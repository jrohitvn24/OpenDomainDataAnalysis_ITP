		<title>13PEOPLE AT HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  Although at one time the villages    
 were probably populated by families   
 who had lived there for many          
 generations things now seem to be     
 quite different. Several people said  
 they had never lived anywhere else but
 a large percentage of the area's      
 population were relative newcomers-   
 some only living there as little as   
 three to five years. Obviously, this  
 reflects the fact that farming is     
 no longer the sole occupation of the  
 area.                                 
  The village atmosphere has, perhaps, 
 been lost to a great extent but is    
 revived on special occasions, like    
 national celebrations when all the    
 residents get together. This situation
 is perhaps different in Ault Hucknall,
 where the church forms a focus for the
 village community.
