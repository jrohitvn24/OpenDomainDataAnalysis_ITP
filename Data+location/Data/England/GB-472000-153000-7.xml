 as Basingstoke,Farnborough and London.
 Some work is available in Hook with   
 Edghills-aircraft components, Spice-

 being the major employers.  Others    
 include:-THM wood products; B&amp;M and   
 Woodpak: Marr Fish Supplies; Carmen-  
 plumber's supplies; King Bonns-       
 engineers; Ashworth- insulation; W.W. 
 Baggs- landscapers:The building firms 
 of Dabwell and C.H Beavis: The car
