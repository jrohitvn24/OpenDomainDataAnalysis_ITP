		<title>08Our School</title>
		<content> Our school is at the top of a hill    
 just outside Rothbury and south of the
 river Coquet. It is named after the   
 Reverend Doctor Thomlinson who founded
 a grammar school in 1720. Our school, 
 which carries his name, was built just
 over twenty years ago.There are       
 approximately 200 children in the     
 school and about half of them travel  
 in by bus from such places as         
 Longframlington, Netherton, Alwinton  
 and Harbottle. I live in Rothbury and 
 I find it hard work climbing the hill 
 some mornings. Some people climb a    
 series of steps just over the bridge  
 to get to school. We call these steps 
 "Jacob's Ladder." Some people cross   
 the stepping stones over the river on 
 their way to school but this is not   
 possible when there is flood water in.
