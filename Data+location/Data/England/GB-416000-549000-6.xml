		<title>06INTERVIEW WITH MISS HANDY</title>
		<content> Miss Handy retired in 1981 as deputy  
 head of South Moor Greenland Junior   
 School.She never missed a day's work  
 in 40 years and attended a garden     
 party at Buckingham Palace on her     
 retirement.                           
 She still preaches in local Methodist 
 churches because she feels it is      
 something she has to do.She has been  
 preaching 33 years and started when   
 she lived in Annfield Plain.          
 Most of her preaching is now done at  
 South Moor Methodist Church,opened in 
 1932, but she still travels throughout
 Co.Durham,and especially likes to     
 visit Whitleyhead Church about 3 miles
 outside Stanley.                      
 She visits South Moor Church many     
 times during the week to help organize
 and arrange other activities,including
 the Boy's Brigade Choir Practice,the  
 Toddlers Club and the Church Wives.   </content>
