		<title>02Upottery Village 2</title>
		<content> There has been a number of changes to 
 the village and, according to a local 
 newspaper of 1955 much of the village 
 was{rebuilt in the 1800s.}The coach   
 house across from the pub was probably
 the stables for the Manor which was   
 also rebuilt at that time. A gatehouse
 and iron gates can also still be seen.
  Some houses were not altered such as 
 the thatched house near the church and
 the war memorial. The house is        
 particularly interesting as it has a  
 set of double doors where the village 
 fire brigade kept a sort of fire      
 engine which they operated by hand.   
 Other important buildings are the     
{church of St.Mary}and the{County      
{Primary  School},a stone construction 
 built in 1877 when the former bulding 
 became the Justice Room.
