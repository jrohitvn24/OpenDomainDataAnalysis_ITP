		<content>      This block has areas of great    
contrast.  The western part which is   
Wallington, Beddington and part of     
Mitcham is mainly open land - parks,   
golf course, and grassland - and the   
parkland in particular is very beaut-  
ful with rivers and small lakes and an 
exceptionally wide variety of trees.   
      The eastern section is in an     
industrial part of Croydon.            
      In the survey we have tried to   
show the differences by portraying the 
life styles of people in each section -
from young children at school, their   
parents at work, and the older gener-  
ation too.                             
      Opportunities for both work and  
leisure differ widely across this      
block and we have tried to show this   
in the photographs as well as the      
script.
