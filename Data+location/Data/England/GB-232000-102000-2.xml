		<title>02HOLSWORTHY PANNIER  MARKET</title>
		<content>  Holsworthy is a small market town    
 whose Pannier market officially began 
 in 1155.The market is held on         
 Wednesdays throughout the year at an  
 open air venue at the main square in  
 Holsworthy.The stalls generally open  
 at 8.00am and close at 4.00pm.The     
 stall holders come from Holsworthy and
 other areas.Stall holders often attend
 other markets in the surrounding area.
 A questionaire showed that the public 
 went to the Wednesday market because  
 they thought it was reliable and cheap
 compared to the shops.To secure a     
 stall one has to contact the Torridge 
 District Council at its Bideford      
 headquarters.It may take two years.The
 market which has approximately 25     
 stalls attracts much attention to the 
 local people and tourists,selling such
 items as fresh foods,fruits and       
 clothes.                              </content>
