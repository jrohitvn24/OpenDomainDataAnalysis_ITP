		<content>{St. Peter's Church}is in the centre   
 of the village. It is a small church  
 overlooking the beach, and this year  
 is celebrating its centenary.         
 The{Methodist Chapel}has a longer     
 history than the church in the        
 village, being built in 1861.         
 Members of the{Church Sunday School } 
 meet twice a month, and once a month  
 join with the church members for a    
 family service and once a month for   
 Family Communion.                     
 The{Coverack Carolare}is an annual    
 event which takes place in August.    
 Organised by the Methodist Church, it 
 is an{interdenominational service,}the
 highlight of which is a service on    
 the harbour. Each year a male-voice   
 choir, a ladies choir, the St. Keverne
 Silver Band and hundreds of people    
 from miles around gather on the       
 harbour to take part in the service.  </content>
