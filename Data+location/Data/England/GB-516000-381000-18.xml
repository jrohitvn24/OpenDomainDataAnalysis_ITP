		<content>    This block contains several small  
 patches of woodland, many planted     
 after the Enclosure in the late 18th  
 century.These contain a mixture of    
 hardwoods, including English oak;beech
 -many of which have reached maturity  
 or beyond;elm -the majority of these  
 have been killed by Dutch Elm Disease 
 in the last decade;ash trees; a few   
 lime; horse-chestnut and sycamore     
 trees. Self-set holly grows as under -
 brush in some spinneys. Yews and      
 copper beech are grown in gardens. The
 County Council has recently planted a 
 number of smaller trees, such as      
 cherry,rowan,whitebeam,field maple and
 silver birch as ornamental trees. Haw-
 thorn and blackthorn were planted as  
 field hedges after Enclosure. There   
 are odd examples of more exotic       
 species, such as Californian Redwood  
 and other conifers.                   </content>
