		<title>19  SNEATH'S MILL (WINDMILL)</title>
		<content>    Sneath's Mill is just inside the   
 parish boundary. Today it consists of 
 the tower with some machinery inside  
 it but no sails. The Mill was working 
 at the time of the 1923 survey, but   
 was derelict in 1953. It is the oldest
 mill in the county and is unique in   
 being the only octagonal one. Above   
 the south entrance of the mill is a   
 date stone, "1779.T.D.AYLIFF.".On the 
 inside first floor beam, facing the   
 entrance is, "THOMAS AY..." also      
 "IOH....RAM". On the upright beam of  
 the first floor level is "T.A.1779"   
 also "T.OLIVER,W. HILLRAM, 1783".     
    It is going to be restored by the  
 Civic Trust, but it will be several   
 years before the work is finished.
