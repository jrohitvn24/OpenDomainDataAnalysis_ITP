		<content> The oldest club is the Ancient Order  
 of Foresters. It was set up in 1880.  
 They meet once a month. The           
 Conservation group have been going for
 the shortest time.                    
   We were able to find the most       
 information on the Tisbury Wives Club.
 This was founded in 1963 by a Mrs     
 Phillips. There are around thirty     
 members and they meet once a month.   
   In 1957 the Flower Group was founded
 again it has about thirty members     
 whose ages range from 20 to 70 years. 
   Tisbury Arts Group was set up in    
 1974, there are around 100 members who
 usually meet monthly but more often if
 a performance is due.                 
   The number of clubs and social      
 groups in Tisbury is numberous and    
 being a rural community this is what  
 you would expect.
