		<content> The arrival of Fine Fare Supermarket  
 in Matlock has been very helpful to   
 some people, but not everyone. When it
 was being built, people said "What    
 will it look like stuck in the middle 
 of the street?" They said it was too  
 big for Matlock and should go to a    
 bigger place. But most people shop    
 there now because they find it cheaper
 and it's not far to go to get there.  
 Some people even come from            
 Chesterfield to shop at Fine Fare. My 
 mum shops there because she doesn't   
 have to walk home. She can catch a bus
 right outside Fine Fare and she's home
 in a jiffy. It's much easier by car   
 too, because you can park your car on 
 the top and get down to the shop by   
 lift.
