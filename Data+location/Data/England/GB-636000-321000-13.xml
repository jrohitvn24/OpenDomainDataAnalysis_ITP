		<content> Vicky Woods used to go to Catfield    
 School but now she has to go out of   
 the block to Stalham Middle.          
                                       
   "I walk down to catch Neave's coach 
 at 7.50. The bus arrives at Stalham   
 Middle at 8.15. School starts at 8.30 
 with assembly. There are about 470    
 children at the school. There are 17  
 classes with about 28 children in     
 each. The first and second year make  
 up lower school, and the third  and   
 fourth year are upper school. We stay 
 with one teacher for two years.Our    
 uniform is red, white and grey. We do 
 English, maths, science, history,     
 geography, French, music, P.E. and    
 games. We have a nice field to play on
 and a new sports hall being built. It 
 should be ready by September. It is a 
 very nice school."
