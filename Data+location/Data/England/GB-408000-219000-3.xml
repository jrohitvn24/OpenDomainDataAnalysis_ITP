		<title>03Landscape Of Notgrove</title>
		<content> The landscape of this block is of a   
 gently undulating patchwork of large  
 cultivated fields, interspersed with  
 sheep and cattle. In a fold of this   
 terrain fresh water was found and     
 people settled giving rise to the     
 village of Notgrove. The cottages all 
 built in locally quarried yellow stone
 and brown tiled roofs blend into this 
 rural landscape. Todays policy is to  
 perpetuate this characteristic, so no 
 red brick or blue tiles are allowed.  
 The cottages, some terraced others    
 detached, all have an individual      
 identity, although as most are owned  
 by the Notgrove Estate a light green  
 paint is uniformly used throughout the
 village. One notable archetechtoral   
 feature is the impressive Notgrove    
 Manor, 17th century in origin, with a 
 wing added this century, all of course
 in the Cotswold style and stone.      </content>
