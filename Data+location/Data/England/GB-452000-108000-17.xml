 the "Horse and Jockey" Public HOuse

 use it.  There is a children's garden 
 at the back.                          
    The YMCA own Fairthorne Manor.  It 
 costs Â£26 to stay there for a week,   
 but the prices vary, according to the 
 accommodation.                        
    On average, l000 people go to the  
 Manor in a year.  All age groups from 
 5-65 are catered for.  Most people go 
 there in the summer, although it is   
 open to the public for most of the    
 year.  There are 94 acres of land, and
 much of this is woodland.  There is a 
 golf course and there are many other  
 recreational facilities.  These are
