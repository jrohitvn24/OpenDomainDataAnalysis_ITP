		<title>17CHILDREN'S FOOD</title>
		<content>    The diet today in this area        
 reflects the efficiency of maritime   
 transport, food preservation          
 techniques and the high standard of   
 living locally.                       
    In a survey carried out by Steven  
 Camp and Daniel Luck of their form    
 they found that the three most popular
 meals were: *Fish and Chips (11),     
 *Hamburger and Chips (9) and          
 *Spaghetti Bolognaisse (5). Vegetables
 were notably lacking !                
    Snacks form an important  part of  
 the daily diet and take the form of   
 *Potato Crisps, *Biscuits and *Chips. 
 *Canned fizzy drinks were very        
 popular, especially Coca Cola. Many   
 dieticians are worried about the lack 
 of balance in this diet and also about
 the level of preservatives in modern  
 'fast foods'. 'Health foods' are now  
 becoming popular with many people.    </content>
