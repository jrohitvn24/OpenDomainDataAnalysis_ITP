    The Stray is a main feature of     
 Hipperholme and Lightcliffe &amp; lies    
 between the two.It is a large open    
 space where children can play on the  
 swings &amp; play hide &amp; seek behind the  
 trees.In Winter it is a very good     
 place for sledging.Many people play   
 football there at Weekends.On the     
 Stray is the Memorial for the         
 remembrance of the two world Wars.    
 Written on the Memorial is the        
 following:                            
           {R.A.S.C.  16  1E           
     {Verbroedering 10   C             
              {BELGIUM                 
 That means that in Brighouse we have a
 link with Belgium &amp; its called the    
 Ludenstein link. In Belgium they have 
 a road with the same name.When        
 Belgians come over they meet round the
 Memorial.                             </content>
