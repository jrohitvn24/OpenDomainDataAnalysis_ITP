		<content> The Manor of Upbury.                  
 Upbury or Beeches in the Parish of    
 Pulloxhill is the site of the ancient 
 'out' manor of Pulloxhill. The estate 
 can be traced back to the Domesday    
 manor, part of the lands of which were
 acquired by Woburn, part by Dunstable,
 the rest being held by William de     
 Faldho, the Buniun family and the     
 Prior of St. John of Jerusalem. The   
 manor house site is to the north of   
 the village; at 187' nearly 160' below
 the average village height. The inner 
 and outer moats are well preserved;   
 still hold water and the fish ponds   
 are still traceable. The manor site   
 itself is much overgrown, the only    
 trace of habitation are a few old     
 tiles, broken pottery in the moat and 
 some stone work where the entrance    
 crossed the inner moats.
