		<content> Most people on farms have{dairy cows. 
 Other animals include{sheep, beef     
{cattle, pigs, hens,dogs, and ponies.  
 The cattle are mainly used for beef.  
 Most people live in old farm houses   
 but only a few live in a listed       
 building (architecturally             
 interesting). Some of the farm houses 
 are very old, some date back to the   
 16th. Century others are 1702, 1814,  
 1884 and 1818 so most of them are over
 100 years old. All the people who live
 on farms have lived there for over 12 
 months, other dates include 2 years,  
 40 years, 6 years, 11 years, 12 years,
 and one person has lived there since  
 they were born.
