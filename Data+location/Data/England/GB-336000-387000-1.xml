    This is predominantly a residential
 area with  a good proportion  of  open
 space and recreational areas.         
              {-------}                
 Several  major  bus routes  cross  the
 area in  a  north-west  to  south-east
 direction and  the  main  railway line
 from London to Liverpool crosses it in
 a largely  north to south direction. A
 line carrying commuter traffic crosses
 the south-west corner of the area.    
              {-------}                
 There is  no  heavy  industry. Service
 industries such as gas and electricity
 are represented, and a small amount of
 light  manufacturing  industry  mostly
 consisting of  fairly small individual
 units.
