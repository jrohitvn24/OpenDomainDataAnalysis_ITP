		<content> There was a steady increase in        
 population(480 in early 16th century).
 A major change came in 1780 when the  
 old two arable field system with      
 pasture was replaced by 97 plots with 
 hedges. After enclosure the town was  
 able to expand from merely a cluster  
 of clay-walled houses by spreading on 
 to the common land and also along the 
 Louth turnpike road.The town continued
 to be a centre for the agriculture of 
 the area and the coming of the railway
 in 1848 increased the importance of   
 the market and thus the town. Charles 
 Dickens described Market Rasen as 'the
 second sleepiest town in all England' 
 but by 1900 the town boasted maltings,
 mills,two corn exchanges, a railway   
 station and other important amenities.
 Today the town retains its market and 
 the cattle market and is the focus of 
 the surrounding countryside.          </content>
