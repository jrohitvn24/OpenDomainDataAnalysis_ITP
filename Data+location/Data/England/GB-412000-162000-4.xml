		<title>04A SCHOOLGIRL'S DAY</title>
		<content> A Typical Day                         
 I get up at 7-30am. I have a bath or a
 shower, brush my teeth and put on my  
 school uniform. I go downstairs and   
 have breakfast.  Afterwards I brush my
 hair and tie it back with an elastic  
 band and I collect my school bag. At  
 8-30am a school taxi collects me as I 
 live more than 3 miles from school.   
   School begins at 9-00am. At 12 noon 
 we have lunch. Some people have a     
 cooked school lunch, others have a    
 packed lunch from home and a few who  
 live nearby go home to eat. School    
 ends at 3-15pm and I return home on   
 the taxi arriving about 3-30pm.       
   I take our three dogs out for a     
 walk. At 4pm I practise on the piano. 
 Later I have my supper and watch the  
 television. I go to bed at 9pm and    
 read for a short time before going to 
 sleep.                                </content>
