		<title>01MILTON ABBAS - W.WHITECHURCH</title>
		<content> The area covered by the survey is in  
 the postal area of Dorchester, the    
 County town of Dorset.                
 The area is almost completely         
 agricultural land with the two        
 villages of Milton Abbas with a       
 population of approximately 900 and   
 Winterborne Whitechurch with a        
 population of 650.                    
 There are eleven farms of varying size
 in the area with the main emphasis on 
 cultivated fields growing barley and  
 wheat with some root crops for animal 
 fodder together with a minor dairy and
 beef cattle interest.                 
 This is an excellent area for the     
 tourist with so much of historical,   
 architectural and natural interest and
 beauty within a small area. The local 
 inns and Caravan park are popular with
 local folk and with the tourist.
