		<title>14A Walk in Lavenham  Part 1</title>
		<content>Opposite the boys entrance of the      
Primary School is one of the oldest    
houses in Lavenham,built by William    
Jacob,a wool trader.Notice the wooden  
door-wide enough to allow the bales of 
wool to enter the house.Approaching    
Market Hill,on the right, is another   
14th Century building,now the head-    
quarters of the Suffolk Preservation   
Society.The little windows at the ends 
of the roof were smoke holes for smoke 
to escape in the days when there were  
no chimneys and the fire was in the    
middle of the floor.The larger windows 
downstairs were important to allow     
maximum light for the spinners and     
weavers to work by.The Market Cross    
was built by William Jacob.It was here 
that the Lord of the Manor met his men 
and explained their duties.The Toll    
Cottage nearby was where rent was paid 
for having a stall on the Market.      </content>
