		<title>11Fordham Church in 1985</title>
		<content>  The church needs between{five and six
{thousand}pounds per year in order to  
 keep going. They raise the money by   
{donations, covenants}and some{fund    
{raising}events, including the fete.   
 Three thousand pounds of this is for  
 the{quota.}This is sent to the Diocese
 and is used to help pay rectors'      
 salaries, pensions and church         
 expenses. The rector has two services 
 on a Sunday, one at Fordham and one at
 Eight Ash Green. This is because he is
 also rector of Eight Ash Green. The   
 service the rector likes best is the  
 Holy Communion service. He also holds 
 a morning service called Matins and an
 evening service called Evensong. There
 are also christenings, weddings and   
 funerals. There are twelve members on 
 the{Parochial Church Council,         
 including two church wardens. Autumn  
 is the busiest time for the rector.   </content>
