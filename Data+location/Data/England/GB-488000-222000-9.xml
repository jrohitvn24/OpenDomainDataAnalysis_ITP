		<title>09The Grand Union Canal</title>
		<content>    This canal was built in the 19th   
 century. It carried goods such as coal
 from the North. The coal would be     
 taken to London to be used in the     
 factories. Sand was also carried from 
 the local sandpits. In the early 20th 
 century the narrow gauge railway would
 carry sand from the nearby sandpits.  
 It was taken to the canalside by small
 diesel trains and loaded onto the     
 barge. Sometimes the barge towed      
 another unpowered barge which was     
 called a butty. This butty increased  
 the amount that could be carried. The 
 canal runs past Grove. There is a lock
 there called Grove Lock. It then runs 
 past Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, then  
 carrying on to London, dividing       
 Linslade and Leighton Buzzard. Water  
 has eroded some of the unprotected    
 banks and sand bags have been used to 
 repair them.                          </content>
