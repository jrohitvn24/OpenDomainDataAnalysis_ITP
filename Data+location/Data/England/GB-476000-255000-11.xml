		<title>11  The Condition of Wootton.</title>
		<content>   Many people think that Wootton is a 
very pleasant place in which to live   
and bring up children but there are a  
number of concerns about the state of  
the village.                           
   There is a great deal of litter     
dropped and pavements and playing      
areas are fouled by dogs. Telephone    
boxes have been vandalised and part of 
the cemetery needs clearing.           
   Some people are concerned about the 
safety of children on the roads and    
about the possibility of them being    
attacked at night.                     
   People are worried about the effect 
of developments in the area and the    
presence of the Barracks at times      
divides the population into army and   
village people.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
