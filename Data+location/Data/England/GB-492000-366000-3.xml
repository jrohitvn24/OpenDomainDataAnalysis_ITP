		<title>03INDUSTRY  GRAVEL PITS</title>
		<content> The gravel pits are amajor industry of
 the North Hykeham area.The Butterley  
 Aggregates pit has been established   
 since 1930.The company employs 40     
 people in the area.From the pit they  
 extract 150,000tonnes of sand and     
 gravel a year.To excavate they use a  
 pump mounted on a floating pontoon.   
 Once extracted the materials are      
 discharged onto a barge to be taken to
 the processing works where it is      
 washed and graded.There are two types 
 of sand,coarse sand for concrete and  
 the other is used for brick and block 
 work.There are three grades of        
 gravel,a 40mm,a 20mm and a10mm.       
 These are used for concrete,drainage  
 work and other things.                
  When the pit is worked out it will be
 landscaped and used for sport.
