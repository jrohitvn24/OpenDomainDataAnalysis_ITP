		<content> A Fourteen year old looks back        
                                       
 Ever since the age of three I have    
 looked forward to the Mop fair and    
 carnival week. It is the only time    
 Marlborough as a whole goes out and   
 enjoys itself.                        
    I'm not sure whether Marlborough   
 has changed, but it must have done.   
 The high street hasn't really changed,
 a new Ramsbury Building Society Office
 has appeared and there has been a     
 public outcry over a few more white   
 lines on the road; I hardly notice    
 they are there.                       
    When term starts the population    
 gains almost a thousand as Marlborough
 College boys and girls flock back.    
 Even the mayor teaches at Marlborough 
 with a foot in each camp. Occasionally
 a shop changes hands, but really      
 Marlborough has not changed a lot.    </content>
