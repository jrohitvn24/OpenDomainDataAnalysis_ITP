{farm.}Most of the work is finished by 
 May &amp; crops include{winter wheat,     
{winter barley &amp; potatoes &amp; 10 acres   
{of grass}which is grazed by{10 beef   
{stores. Herbicides and pesticides}are 
 used to keep all crops in perfect     
 condition. In August &amp; early September
 wheat &amp; barley are harvested.         
 Ploughing is done in October, followed
 by sowing &amp; drilling. During winter   
 hedges, ditches &amp; machinery are       
 maintained.{The farm is on the edge of
{the urban fringe}but there are no     
 problems of damage or conflict with   
 nearby residents.                     
   A public footpath crosses the fields
 and is used by the local secondary    
 school for cross country. Next to the 
 farm is a sewage works, which will    
 soon close as new pipes are being     
 laid.                                 </content>
