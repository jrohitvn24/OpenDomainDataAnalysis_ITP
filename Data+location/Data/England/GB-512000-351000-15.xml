		<title>15A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My name is Deborah Hamblin. I am 9    
 years old. I will tell you what I do  
 on Monday.I wake up at 7.30. I lay in 
 till 8.00 and then  get dressed, go   
 down stairs and have my breakfast.Then
 it is soon time to go to school. When 
 I get to school I talk to my friends  
 Vicki,Katie and Verity until bell-time
 at 9.00.When we go in we have register
 and then maths until playtime. After  
 play we do topic work for an hour. At 
 12.00 we have our dinner-time which   
 is an hour as well. After dinner we   
 write our spellings into our books    
 then we do sewing till afternoon play.
 After play some of us have recorder   
 lessons. Then it is soon home-time.   
 When I get home I put my roller skates
 and play until tea-time at 5.00. After
 tea I watch T.V.I get ready for bed at
 7.30 and watch more T.V. until I go to
 bed at 9.00.                          </content>
