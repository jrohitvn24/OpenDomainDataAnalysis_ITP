		<title>09WHALEY WATER WORKS.</title>
		<content>      Whaley Water Works was opened in 
 1938 to provide water for the Bolsover
 area. It was built by the Chesterfield
 and Bolsover Water Board.             
      The water was obtained from two  
 bore holes, Whaley Well and Gildwell. 
 An average of 2273 cubic metres of    
 water per day was drawn from Whaley   
 with 545 cubic metres compensation    
 water being returned to the stream.   
 1136 cubic metres of water was drawn  
 from Gildwell where compensation water
 was not necessary. It was then        
 purified by passing it through high   
 pressure filters. Finally it was      
 chlorinated to kill any germs.        
      The water works was closed after 
 it was discovered that the bore holes 
 had become contaminated by the        
 nitrates used as fertilisers by local 
 farmers.
