		<content> Clubs - Service to Godshill Community.
 Serving the very young are a Mother   
 and Baby Group, and a flourishing     
 pre-school Playgroup, while all       
 sections of the community are helped  
 by such elected groups as the Parish  
 Council, Parochial Church Council,    
 Village Hall Committee, School        
 Governors and Parent Teacher          
 Association. The Royal British Legion,
 whose members are all connected with  
 H.M. Armed Forces, has both social and
 charitable functions. The villagers   
 have bought, and maintain by voluntary
 effort, a community mini-bus,         
 available on hire to all, which runs  
 regularly twice a week to and from    
 Newport when it is used mainly by the 
 elderly. Residents have special reason
 to be pleased with themselves in 1985 
 as the village won the title "Isle of 
 Wight Best Kept Village".             </content>
