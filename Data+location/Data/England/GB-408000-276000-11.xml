 YEAR OLD GIRL IN THIS AREA.           
                                       
  In the morning my mom wakes me up at 
 7.40am.,I get dressed in clothes of my
 own choice.I eat breakfast which is   
 cereal or egg,toast and a cup of tea. 
  While I am listening to B.R.M.B.my   
 brother gets up and my mom makes my   
 sandwiches and then I start out to    
 walk to school at 8.30am.I usually    
 meet my friend on the way.            
  School starts at 8.55 and we have the
 register and then go downstairs for   
 assembly.Afterwards we have maths.and 
 at 10. 40 it is playtime.We ring the  
 bell at 10.55 and then we have        
 English.Then lunchtime arrives and we 
 eat our sandwiches in the hall and if 
 it is fine we go out to play.         
  In the afternoon we have other       
 lesson eg. P.E. Art,Craft or Topic.   </content>
