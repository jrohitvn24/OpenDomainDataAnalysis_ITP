 In mid twentieth century this area was
 the centre of a clay industry.Huge    
 amounts of clay were extracted to make
 tiles and bricks.The large deep and   
 dangerous pond next to the housing    
 estate is an abandoned clay pit.It is 
 not safe for swimming or boating,but  
 it has an abundance of fish and       
 wildlife.Pontoons dotted around the   
 edge of the Ponds are used by anglers.
         {Hill House.}                 
 In 1766 a Georgian House was built for
 the Evered Family on a hill close to  
 Combwich.It became St. Hilda's School 
 in 1935.In 1976 it was taken over by  
 the Bristol Christian Youth Trust as a
 centre for children(11-18 years old). 
 With 15 acres of land,there are       
 facilities for swimming,tennis,camping
 adventure activities and wildlife     
 studies.                              </content>
