		<title>13SLAWIT MOONRAKERS.</title>
		<content> Smuggling was quite commonplace in the
 early 19th. Century,and in those      
 days,the canal which ran through the  
 centre of Slaithwaite Village was very
 busy with barges and trading boats.   
 The wharf would be full of boats      
 loading and unloading their           
 merchandise. So it was very probable  
 that on a dark night smuggled casks   
 of Brandy or Rum were dumped into the 
 canal to be recovered at a later date 
 The story goes that some of the       
 smugglers were caught by the customs  
 men in the act of raking the canal    
 to find the contraband, they pretended
 to be either dim-witted or drunk and  
 said they were raking that cheese out 
 of the canal.The cheese being the     
 reflection of the full moon on the    
 water.Hence-Slawit Moonrakers.
