		<title>01OUR BLOCK IN OLDHAM</title>
		<content>    The block we have been allocated   
 covers part of the centre of Oldham   
 and all of the suburbs between Oldham 
 and Ashton. The road between these two
 towns is one edge of our square and is
 the focal point of  of the activity in
 the square.                           
   Most of the housing is pre-war, but 
 there is a large housing estate built 
 in the 1960's.As part of Greater      
 Manchester all the local services are 
 jointly run by Greater Manchester     
 Council(to be abolished in 1986) and  
 Oldham Borough Council.               
   Leisure in the area is fairly       
 limited.Several community centres hold
 regular functions,but with a cinema in
 Ashton,and one theatre in each town,it
 is neccesary to move out of the block 
 for ntertainment. There is however a  
 large park in the area called         
 Alexandra Park.                       </content>
