		<content> One day in May a man from the Badger  
 Club called MR STREETER came to take  
 us on a walk.                         
                                       
 When we went on the walk we heard a   
 willow wabler, a black cap and a      
 robin.                                
                                       
 We saw a bundle of feathers and MR    
 STREETER said it was where a bird had 
 fluffed out feathers to make him nice 
 so to attract a lady bird.            
                                       
 We smelt this horrible smell, it was  
 pigs dung. We teased Philip that it   
 was him.                              
                                       
 After the walk we were tired.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
