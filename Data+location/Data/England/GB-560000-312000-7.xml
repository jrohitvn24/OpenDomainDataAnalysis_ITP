		<content> The area supports many birds,         
 including herons, goldfinches,        
 blackbirds, robins, gulls,            
 magpies, wrens, thrushes and          
 (particularly) sparrows. Although     
 fields are heavily sprayed, there are 
 many trees and hedgerows left largely 
 alone by the farmers, and these       
 provide homes for the birds and also a
 smaller number of animals, including  
 rabbits, stoats, squirrels and        
 hedgehogs.                            
                                       
 The farmers encourage pheasants,      
 mainly for so-called "sport"          
 (shooting) and many of the villagers  
 shoot for fun or for the table, though
 probably only occasionally.           
                                       
 The area supports a few domesticated  
 animals, including goats, horses and a
 few cattle. Most families have dogs.  </content>
