		<title>06White Notley station (2)</title>
		<content> the line is still operating and has   
 grown.                                
    Today there are trains in both     
 directions running from early morning 
 until quite late at night at roughly  
 hourly intervals. Most of the trains  
 are eight carriage electric trains    
 which link Braintree with Liverpool   
 Street. If you are going to White     
 Notley you have to choose your        
 carriage carefully because the        
 platform is only long enough for two  
 carriages!                            
    The whole station is controlled by 
 one man but two men are employed so   
 that they work part of each day.      
    Part of their job is to move the   
 gates on the level crossing whenever a
 train is coming because when the line 
 was electrified nearly ten years ago  
 the level crossing was not changed.
