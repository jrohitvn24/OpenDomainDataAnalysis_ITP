		<title>03COMMUNITY BUS</title>
		<content> There is a small bus called the       
 Community Bus that goes round the     
 small villages where the ordinary     
 service buses no longer go.The idea   
 came into being after rural buses were
 cut and many elderly and non car      
 owners became cut off. The council    
 subsidizes the buses and people can   
 get special passes like on ordinary   
 buses.                                
 The bus is driven by a member of the  
 public who holds a PSV license.       
 These buses take people to the towns  
 specially on market days(Monday in    
 Aylsham and Thursday in North Walsham)
