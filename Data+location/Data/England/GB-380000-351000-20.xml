		<title>20Mrs Thatcher in Talke</title>
		<content>   Mrs Thatcher is the Prime Minister, 
who lives in London. Stephen Spence is 
a pupil at Hill Top, but there is more 
to Stephen that meets the eye. He is   
an impressionist. He went to           
Prestatyn, Royal Lido, on the 7th of   
September to "make Buster Laugh". He   
did an impression of Gladys Pugh off   
the "Hi de hi" television programme,   
and also Margaret Thatcher. This is    
what he said, "Dennis get me a glass   
of whisky or else I'll pull your teeth 
out with one of your golf clubs."      
   Two hundred and ninety people were  
judged and Stephen made it to the final
and won. The prizes were twenty five   
pounds, a trophy to keep for a year and
a replica for himself. I.P.C. magazines
also sponsored a years subscription to 
the "Buster" comic.
