		<title>06My Place in Frogmore.</title>
		<content> I live in a beautiful house because it
 is in a quiet village called Frogmore.
 I like my bedroom because when I look 
 out of the window I can see my garden 
 with the sun shining through the      
 window. Sometimes mummy and daddy let 
 me walk to the village shop to get    
 things. Sometimes my neighbour takes  
 me out in his boat. We've got a big   
 garden and I play in it quite a lot.  
 We've got a sand pit and a rope ladder
 to play on. We've got two apple trees 
 and three plum trees, a blackcurrant  
 bush and strawberries. We've got four 
 animals, two dogs and two cats. One of
 our dogs used to tunnel under the     
 fence and walk down to our neighbour's
 house and mummy had to fetch it back. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
