		<content> Plant life survives for the most part 
 in spite of man,not because of him.   
 Dense plantations of conifers have    
 obliterated the plants which once grew
 healthily under the branches of the   
 deciduous trees.The downland plant    
 populations have been steadily reduced
 by the increased cultivation and use  
 the use of chemical sprays.   A       
 further factor to consider is the     
 major ecological change on the        
 downland caused by a long-term decline
 in sheep flocks and the introduction  
 of myxomatosis.The short,close turf of
 the downs produced by the nibbling of 
 generations of sheep and rabbits is   
 giving way to areas of scrub          
 consisting of wider and untypical     
 flora spreading up the slopes. If this
 continues,a major characteristic of   
 downland will disappear.
