		<content> The only industry which remains active
 in these valleys is agriculture. There
 are many small farms who keep the     
 local Herdwick sheep on the fells and 
 benefit from the hill farms subsidies 
 supplied by the E.E.C. Some of the    
 farms also keep store cattle for      
 fattening through the winter. They and
 the sheep are sustained through the   
 winter by silage and hay harvested of 
 the lower pastures during the summer. 
 There are a few dairy farms also      
 operating. Most livestock is taken to 
 Broughton market (2\ miles away) or to
 the much larger market at Ulverston   
 (12 miles).                           
 Lately there has been an interest in  
 tourism but this is very small and is 
 limited to a few farms offering bed   
 and breakfast accomodation.
