		<content>   The  vast  majority of residents are
 employed  in  the  area,  although  a 
 number use  Clifton  Hampden, which is
 conveniently  near Didcot British Rail
 station, for commuting to London.     
                                       
   Once  farming  employed  much of the
 vilage  population  but  now  the  JET
 project  and the  Culham  Laboratories
 provide a large number of jobs such as
 cleaning for  indigenous  labour. Very
 few scientists live locally.          
                                       
   Many  new  families  work  slightly 
 further afield in  Oxford, especially 
 at the University or the Cowley Works,
 although jobs are diverse and include 
 the theatre.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
