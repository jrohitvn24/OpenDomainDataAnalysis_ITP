		<title>17Droitwich - Changing Face</title>
		<content> Droitwich has seen many changes in the
 last 70 years. Mr. W. Bispan(83) and  
 Mr.H.J.Maycroft (69) commented on     
 these changes. Both commented on the  
 great growth of Droitwich and the     
 problems that have come with it- more 
 traffic, old shops deteriorating, lots
 more people coming in from outside.   
 However, houses have changed for the  
 better, with inside toilets and       
 bathrooms, food and money are more    
 plentiful than when they were young.  
 The provision of the NHS(1948) was    
 regarded as a great improvement. Less 
 clothes were being worn at swimming   
 pools, but Mr.Bispan remembers the    
 Droitwich ladies working stripped to  
 the waist in the local salt mines when
 he was young! Both remember the great 
 celebrations on VE day and the        
 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth 11(1953)
 Both like Droitwich people.           </content>
