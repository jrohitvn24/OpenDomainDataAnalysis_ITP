		<content> Many histories tell about Hunna the   
 Dane invading "Cynuit Castle". There  
 is a tradition that Cynuit is Kenwith 
 Castle near Abbotsham. Hubba landed in
 Appledore Bay and went upto Northam   
 and onto Kenwith, where he laid       
 seige to the castle. The Danes thought
 the castle had no water supply and so 
 they believed the people inside would 
 have to surrender. But the Saxons in  
 Kenwith managed to break-out,         
 surprising the Danes who had to flee  
 for their ships. In a skirmish during 
 the reatreat, it is said that Hubba   
 was killed at a spot now called       
 'Bloody Corner', where a plague       
 commemorates the event, but there is  
 no other evidence that this is true.
