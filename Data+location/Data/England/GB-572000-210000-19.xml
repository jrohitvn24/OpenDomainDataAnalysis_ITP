		<title>19HOME LIFE BOREHAM</title>
		<content> I am Gina my age is eleven and this is
 my last term at Boreham Primary       
 School.I live in the North of Boreham 
 Parish close to Fords Proving Ground. 
 Work starts there at 8 oclock in the  
 morning, and about 100 cars pour into 
 the car park. Lorries also thunder    
 down our lane sometimes.Sunday is much
 quieter than weekdays. There are 3    
 houses in the lane and Holts Farm,    
 which is being renovated, this has    
 been going on for five years!         
 Our house used to be rented to farm   
 labourers.                            
 Behind us is a field, where wheat is  
 grown.This may soon be used for the   
 extraction of gravel. I do hope not!  
 That would bring the gravel pits so   
 much nearer to our house.             
 Although when the gravel has been     
 removed it might then be turned into a
 reservoir.                            </content>
