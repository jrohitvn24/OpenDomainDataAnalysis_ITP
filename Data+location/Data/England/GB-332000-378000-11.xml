		<content>  We surveyed round the school and out 
 of school about what programmes people
 watch on T.V.what newspapers people   
 buy and what magazines people buy.    
     The results of the survey on what 
 newspapers people get are as follows: 
 the Mirror was the most popular but   
 many people read the Telegraph too.   
      When we did the survey on what   
 programmes people watch, a lot of     
 people                                
 watched Drama,but it was voted that   
 Films were the most popular.We found  
 out that younger people dont like     
 reading as much, and  older people    
 would rather read instead of watching 
 T.V.                                  
      When we surveyed about what      
 favourite magazines people buy,we     
 found that Smash Hits was popular with
 the younger people because it was to  
 do with pop records.                  </content>
