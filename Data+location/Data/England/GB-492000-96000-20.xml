{"There could be oil in them there     
{fields!"}It is reported that a British
 exploration company are seeking       
 approval to drill for oil on the      
 outskirts of Bognor Regis.The people  
 we interviewed had mixed feelings     
 about this proposal though many said  
 they thought it was acceptable as long
 as the area was landscaped.
