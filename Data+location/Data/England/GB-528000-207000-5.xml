		<title>05Two Farms in Bayford Area</title>
		<content>  The two largest farms in our survey {
 block are Danes Farm and Bayford Hall 
 Farm. We interviewed the farmers in   
 late June.                            
{ Danes Farm}was built in the late 16C.
 It is believed that Queen Elizabeth I 
 may have slept there. The farm is 550 
 acres in size, has 1 barn and the farm
 has expanded over the years. It has   
 just 2 workers, with no specialists.  
{ Bayford Hall Farm}was built in 1900. 
 This 200 acre farm has 4 barns. It    
 employs 2 general workers (shared with
 the owner's 3 other farms), and       
 specialised spray workers are also    
 use when required                     
  Both farmers commented on the heavy  
 clay soils, and saw{better drainage}as
 a priority for the future.
