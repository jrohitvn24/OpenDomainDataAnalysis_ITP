		<content> We visited Sparkford Museum this      
 morning.The museum is owned by Mr     
 Haynes.It has over 40 cars in         
 it,vintage cars and cars from the     
 60's. We were the first public people 
 to see the cars in the museum.It was  
 very interesting looking at and       
 reading about the cars.               
        Everybody thought that the     
 museum was interesting especially when
 the curator started up two cars.All   
 the boys chose a car,Renfred akind of 
 Limousine,Simon an AC Cobra.Daniel a  
 Stingray and I  chose a Jaguar XJS.It 
 was officially opened on the 10/7/85  
 by Richard Noble, the holder of the   
 world Landspeed record.A lot of famous
 people came from the racing world.
