		<title>20THE COTTAGE-MNKTN HEATHFIELD</title>
		<content>  The 3 pubs in the area are similar in
 that they all have limited housing to 
 draw on,relying on travellers and pub 
 games to boost their sales.           
  The Cottage had a skittle alley built
 in Sept.1981.The alley is used 3 times
 a week.2 ladies &amp; 2 mens teams play in
 the Taunton league.The players have a 
 buffet afterwards.This is good advert-
 ising for the pub.Darts &amp; cribbage are
 also played.Whitbread beer (Tiverton  
 brewery) is the most popular drink for
 men;vodka or lager for the ladies.    
  The Cottage does good pub lunches.Two
 bar staff help the landlord and his   
 wife serve the 50 or so customers each
 day.25-30 of these drink in the even- 
 ing. The pub opens from noon until 2pm
 and from 6 until 11pm.                
  The landlord lives above the pub.This
 means he has less privacy than someone
 living in an ordinary house.          </content>
