{Public Houses.}The boarding house,    
 Dene Holme, was a hotel.There was the 
 Riding Hotel, the Dale Hotel, the     
 Heatherlea Hotel, the Hotspur Hotel,  
 the Golden Lion, the Hare and Hounds, 
 the Allendale and the Kings Head. {   
{Transport. }Transport now is very     
 expensive;it is Â£1.80 to Hexham and   
 back.It used to be 2/6 (12\p) in      
 the 1930's.                           
{Churches.}In 1930 nearly all the      
 churches were the same as now. The    
 Methodist Church at Dawson Place      
 closed and is now used as a library.  
 It is still possible to get up to the 
 balcony and sit in the pews.
