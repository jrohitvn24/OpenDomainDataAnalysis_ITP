		<content> Class 5 walked to{Carn Brea}(a hill   
 near our school) to view our          
 D.Block.We could see{Tehidy Golf      
{Course}and{Tehidy Woods.}There is the 
 village of{Illogan,Bridge,Vogue Beloth
 and{Paynter's Lane End.}The buildings 
 of Treloweth School and{Tehidy        
{Hospital}could be clearly seen.Down   
 the road from our Treloweth School is 
 a housing estate called the{Guiness   
{Trust.}It was built two years ago.We  
 have  many farms and mines in our     
 area.Many of the mines are on derelict
 land and are disused.Some farmers     
 have tourists for{Bed &amp; Breakfast}and 
 campers stay for a couple of weeks.The
 farms are mainly small and have small 
 fields for their cows and horses to   
 graze in.We have also part of         
{Portreath valley}in our D.Block and   
 part of the{Portreath Coast line}at   
{Porth-Cadjack Cove.                   </content>
