		<title>03MAPPERLEY HOSPITAL</title>
		<content> Mapperley Hospital was established in 
 1880.When it opened,people were very  
 hostile towards the mentally ill.Such 
 hospitals were built in the suburbs of
 towns.To control the patients,several 
 methods were used such as air         
 spectacles,straight jackets and       
 hydrotherapy.Today,care for mentally  
 ill patients is community based.      
 Therapy includes discussions about    
 personal problems and drugs used.Over 
 50% of Mapperley's patients are on a  
 day care programme,where they come in 
 the day and sleep in their own homes. 
 The size of the hospital has changed  
 dramatically over the last century.   
 Originally designed for 1000 patients,
 today it accommodates 303.In the      
 future,Mapperley Hospital is to be    
 closed,and care for mentally unstable 
 people will be even more community    
 based.                Clair Palmer(11)</content>
