		<title>06Beetham Hall Farm.</title>
		<content>       Beetham Hall was a fortified    
 Manor but is now a farm. It has       
 changed alot since it was mentioned in
 the Domesday Book.                    
       Mr.Savages day begins at 6 a.m. 
 for milking and this is repeated at 5 
 p.m.He has Fresian cows,a Limazan bull
 and some sheep.                       
       About 7 a.m. he has his         
 breakfast of bacon and egg then they  
 get on with farm work such as mucking 
 out.                                  
   The land is used for grazing and    
 silage production .They do not have   
  many workers, because they now use   
 modern farming equipment.             
      Under the old oak staircase is a 
 strange door which opens on its own   
 accord at the strangest time. They    
 think it is a ghost.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
