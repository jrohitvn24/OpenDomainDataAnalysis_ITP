		<content>     Heathylee is a large parish which 
is mostly above 300 metres O.D.  It is 
drained by Oakenclough Brook and the   
River Manifold.  The rocks are         
sandstones and shales of the Namurian  
Series.  The climate is cold and wet   
because the land is so high.  This     
results in a natural vegetation of     
heather and bilberry on the better     
drained soils and peat bog and cotton  
grass on the wetter areas; the river   
valleys had a tree-covering of willow  
and alder by the rivers and mixed      
woodland on the lower slopes of the    
hills.  Now the land is mostly covered 
with pasture and meadow on the lower   
areas, though there is a small area of 
coniferous trees with a small number of
deciduous trees interspersed.          
     Most of the inhabitants are       
connected with farming, but there is   
one garage for repairs and fuel.       </content>
