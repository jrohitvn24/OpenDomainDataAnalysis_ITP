		<title>01St Annes -Historical Origins</title>
		<content> In the 12C,Richard Fitzroger gave his 
 estate at Lethun (Lidun in Domesday)  
 to Benedictine monks. After the       
 Reformation the estate changed hands  
 until 1606 when it came to Sir        
 Cuthbert Clifton whose successor,John 
 Talbot Clifton esq, leased a part of  
 what was Lytham Common,much of it     
 sand-hills,to a company of gentlemen  
 for 999 years.                        
     The idea behind St Annes was that 
 of wealthy cotton magnates who aimed  
 to develop the flat area behind the   
 sand hills &amp; build fine mansions      
 from which to travel daily to         
 Manchester &amp; to retire to.Changes     
 in the economic climate beginning in  
 the cotton slump of the 1920's and    
 1930's began slowly to alter the      
 prosperous little town.Modern hotels  
 and flats are now dominant,but some   
 uniqueness has been retained.         </content>
