		<content>The Salvation Army started in Lavenham 
on 19th June 1884 with an open-air     
meeting in Bolton Street,led by a      
converted hawker named Â£Gypsy' Knights.
Since then the Gospel message of Jesus 
has been proclaimed both in our Hall on
the Common and in the streets of       
Lavenham.                              
 The band is heard regularly on the    
Market Place,also at Christmas and     
on Easter morning.Our songsters provide
vocal music for all meetings. The      
weekly programme consists of Ladies    
meetings, Mother and Toddler           
Club,Sunday School,Public Sunday       
meetings and distribution of Army      
papers in the public houses.All this   
continuously for the last 100 years!
