		<title>01OVERVIEW OF SPALDWICK AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is mainly farm land,with     
 mainly cereal crops,rape,and some     
 potatoes.There are three villages     
 here.Spaldwick,Easton,and part of     
 Ellington.The villages are small.There
 is to be no new housing development in
 Spaldwick,but Ellington's population  
 is still growing.The majority of      
 people moved into this area because it
 has easy access to London and is close
 to the A1.A new road is to be built   
 soon joining the A1 to the M1.There is
 only a small amount of light industry 
 in the area.There is one primary      
 school in the area which takes the    
 children from seven villages.The      
 children are brought to school on two 
 buses.When they leave the children go 
 to a comprehensive school which is    
 about seven miles away.
