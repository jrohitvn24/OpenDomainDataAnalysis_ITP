		<content> After passing through the village seat
 of learning all children travel to the
 secondary school of their choice.     
 Recent years have seen the growth of  
 excellent secondary and high schools  
 in Lancaster,Garstang and Preesall.   
 Depending upon current whims of parent
 or child most pupils have transferred 
 at 11 to either,{Garstang High School 
{or Ripley S.Thomas,}Lancaster.        
 Ripley has its own 6th form but those 
 pupils at Garstang normally progress  
 to{W.R.Tuson College,}Preston.        
 A surprisingly high number of students
 have passed through the village school
 and eventually on to Polytechnics and 
 Universities throughout the land in   
 recent years.                         
 In the village is the{Winmarleigh     
{College}occupying the Hall and park,a 
 minor part of{Lancashire College of   
{Agriculture.}                         </content>
