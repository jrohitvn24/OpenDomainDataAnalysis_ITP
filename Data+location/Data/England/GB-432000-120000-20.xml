		<title>20ROMSEY ADVERTISER</title>
		<content> Since 1896 yearly files have been     
 kept.  The Advertiser is a weekly     
 paper but it works like a daily paper.
 The news a journalist looks for is    
 people, names, faces, births,         
 marriages and deaths.  Twenty-six     
 years ago the paper only had 4 pages, 
 no photos and cost 1p.  Today the     
 paper has 12 pages and costs 14p.  The
 Romsey Advertiser is also sold in     
 America, Canada, Belgium and South    
 Africa.
