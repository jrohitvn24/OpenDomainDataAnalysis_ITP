		<title>08BROOMFIELD CHURCH</title>
		<content> The oldest part of the present church 
 is the south chancel wall which has   
 a small doorway. It was probably built
 before 1320. The tower of Broomfield  
 Church was built in 1440. The south   
 side of the nave and the chancel arch 
 and porch were rebuilt and the aisle  
 was added in the 16th century. The    
 east wall and window were put there in
 the 19th century.                     
 The large trees protect the church    
 from the north and east winds.        
 The beautiful wagon roofs of the nave 
 and aisle are of a similar style.Above
 the south door are the royal arms of  
 Queen Anne dated 1714.                
 Andrew Crosse, one of the earliest    
 scientists to study electrical energy 
 is buried in the church.              
 The carved bench-ends dated 1522 are  
 by Simon Werman, who also carved the  
 bench-ends in Trull church.           </content>
