		<content>  The school has eleven governors, with
 Rev.G.Hamey as Chairman and           
 Mr.C.Mummer as Clerk. They meet at    
 least once a term.                    
  The future of the school,as with many
 other schools in Norfolk,is uncertain 
 as the Education Committee have       
 recently put forwards some guidelines,
 suggesting that the curriculum in     
 small schools is inadequate and that a
 reasonable number of teachers for a   
 primary school should be 7 with 160+  
 pupils. This would mean the wholesale 
 closure of over 100 primary schools in
 Norfolk and sound the death knell to  
 village community life.               
  A possible solution to this problem  
 may be the amalgamation of small      
 schools,rather than transporting the  
 children to the nearest town with the 
 resultant effect of the disappearance 
 of village life.                      </content>
