 The school was built in 1874 near the 
 church.  It is not a church school    
 now.  The first head was called Mr    
 Masters.  His wife taught the infants 
 and they lived in the school house.   
 During World War Two the school was   
 very overcrowded with children from   
 the airforce camp.  When the displaced
 people moved on the school population 
 returned to normal, and since the war 
 has sometimes fallen so low that the  
 school has been threatened with       
 closure.  In 1983 children from       
 Allostock school transferred to Byley 
 when Allostock school closed.  The    
 school has since been modernised and  
 extended to include the school house  
 as a teaching area, and its future    
 should be secure.
