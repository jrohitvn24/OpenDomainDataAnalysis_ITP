		<content> The Priory Church, the Church of St   
 Peter and St Paul. The foundation of  
 the church goes back to 660 A.D.      
 Ealfred a Northumbrian missionary was 
 the first Abbot. The oldest part of   
 the present church was built by Norman
 Monks in 1130. The Central Nave was   
 added in 1239 and the South Aisle in  
 1320. All that remains of this great  
 church is the Naves. The East end,    
 including the choir,chapels,transepts 
 and central towers were pulled down at
 the Reformation in 1539. Since then it
 has served as the parish church and is
 part of our national heritage.        
 The Roman Catholics,Baptists,         
 Methodists, Brethren and Apostolics   
 have their Churches and Chapels too.  
 Grange Court was built by John Abel   
 in 1633 in the centre of the town.    
 This elegant building now adorns the  
 Grange, being removed there in 1854.  </content>
