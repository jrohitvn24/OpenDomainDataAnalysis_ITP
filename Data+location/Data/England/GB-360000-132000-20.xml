		<content> The town of Castle Cary has a         
 population of approximately 2,700.This
 includes the associated village of    
 Ansford,to the north of Castle        
 Cary,which has its own parish church. 
 Children from the surrounding         
 area,including the villages/hamlets of
 Alford,Clanville and Sutton come      
 within the catchment area of Castle   
 Cary schools,while those in Alhampton 
 attend Ditcheat Primary but join the  
 others at Ansford Secondary.          
 The main feature of the surrounding   
 area is dairy farming,with some light 
 industry based in Castle Cary and     
 Ansford.The majority of the population
 is centred in Castle Cary and         
 Ansford,while a proportion of village 
 properties are now being sold as      
 holiday homes/weekend cottages.
