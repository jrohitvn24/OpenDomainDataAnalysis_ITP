		<title>13HAIR STYLES</title>
		<content>  When me and my friend SARAH BACKWAY  
 went to {"Hairs and Graces"},we asked 
 them if they do PUNK and they said    
 'NO'.Then we asked when people have   
 their hair dyed what colour do they   
 have it and the lady said'NATURAL     
 COLOUR'and that any age come in.The   
 most popular hair style out of perm or
 just trimmed is the same each way and{
{WOMEN}tend to come in more than {MEN}.
 When we asked if old or young people  
 come in most they said old.When we    
 asked which is the busiest time of day
 and what day of the week they said    
{FRIDAY }and{SATURDAY}and dinner time. 
 We asked them if lots of childen come 
 in and they said'YES'.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
