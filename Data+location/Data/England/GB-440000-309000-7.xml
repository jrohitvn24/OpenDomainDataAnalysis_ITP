		<title>07A LIFE-TIME IN IBSTOCK</title>
		<content>    One elderly resident of Ibstock is 
 82-year-old Mr Sid Ward, who lives    
 next door to the junior school in     
 Melbourne Road.                       
    Mr Ward worked as a butcher in the 
 Ibstock branch of the Leicestershire  
 Co-operative Society for 22 years. His
 father before him was a butcher and he
 recalls that as a boy he used to help 
 his father kill sheep before walking  
 a mile to school. Now, he says, the   
 meat arrives at most butchers ready   
 prepared, even pre-packed and frozen. 
    The main change in Ibstock, says Mr
 Ward, is the increased traffic and    
 housing.                              
    He remembers when there were       
 thatched cottages on Chapel Street and
 extensive views over open fields where
 the Wilson and Jelson housing estates 
 now stand.                            
                                       </content>
