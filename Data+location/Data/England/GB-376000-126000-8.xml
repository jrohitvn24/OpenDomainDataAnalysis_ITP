		<content>    Most of the fields in this area are
 grassland and there is some wheat,    
 corn and barley grown. Much of the    
 area is devoted to farming, especially
 dairy farming.There are ten farms in  
 our area. Milton Farm, Slaughtergate  
 Farm, Wyke Farm, Bainly Farm, Pierston
 Farm, Stock Farm, Whistley Farm, Lower
 Langham Farm, Depley Farm and Quarr   
 Farm. These are mainly dairy farms.   
 There is also a pig farm.             
    Much of the grass grown on farmland
 is cut in summer and stored as silage 
 to make winter feed for the herds. The
 milk produced on these farms is       
 collected daily and frequently checked
 for quality by a government body. The 
 farmers are also only allowed to      
 produce a certain quota of milk by the
 government.
