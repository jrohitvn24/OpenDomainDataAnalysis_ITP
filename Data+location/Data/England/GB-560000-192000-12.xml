		<content> There are several patches of woodland,
 some privately owned, other maintained
 by the local council. Of the latter   
 category is{Hart's Wood,}an area of   
 broad-leaved trees sensitively        
 managed. Of many species Oak is common
 throughout (many trees being about 100
 years old), as is Silver Birch. Sweet 
 Chestnuts grow in groups, while Beech 
 and Ash are more scarce. There are    
 some Hornbeams, long ago pollarded,   
 while Rowan and Holly are abundant at 
 lower levels. Bracken and Bramble     
 provide much ground-cover. Among      
 mammals, Grey Squirrel and Badger     
 inhabit the wood.{Shenfield Common}has
 been colonized by trees only since    
 "navvies" dug the railway cutting in  
 1840's, leaving uneven ground known as
 "The Tips". Thiftwood has a similar   
 mixture of deciduous trees, but is    
 owned by the Scouting Association.    </content>
