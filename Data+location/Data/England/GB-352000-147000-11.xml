		<title>11WOOKEY HOLE CAVES.</title>
		<content>    THE RIVER AXE FLOWS THROUGH WOOKEY 
 HOLE CAVES AND BY THE VILLAGE CAR     
 PARK.                                 
    THERE IT IS, FLOWING OVER LOTS OF  
 STONES,AND SOME WEEDS,  BUT NOT MANY  
 FLOWERS.IN THE STREAM THERE           
 ISN'T MUCH WILDLIFE TO BE SEEN BECAUSE
  IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HIDING IN THE   
 WEED. IT IS NICE AND PEACEFUL TO      
 JUST SIT BY THE RIVER AND LISTEN TO   
 THE RUNNING WATER.                    
   LOCAL BOYS ENJOY FISHING IN THE     
 RIVER, BY THE CAR PARK OR AT TROUT'S  
 BEND WHERE THE RIVER GENTLY WANDERS   
 ALONG WITH DEEPS AND SHALLOWS, LINED  
  BY TREES AND ECHOING THE SOUNDS OF   
 THE BIRDS.                            
  ON AND ON, GOES THE RIVER, PAST      
 FIELDS AND HEDGES,GRAZING CATTLE AND  
 THE PEACEFUL SOMERSET COUNTRYSIDE.    
                                       
                                       </content>
