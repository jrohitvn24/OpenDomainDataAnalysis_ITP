		<title>11LOCAL GEOGRAPHY</title>
		<content> The main feature of the area is the   
 wide, shallow valley of the River Bure
 which runs in a NW to SE direction.   
 The highest point is about 15m above  
 sea level and the lowest is less than 
 10m down in the river vally.          
 The river is slow moving and shallow  
 and moves in two great arcs across the
 area. It has an average width of about
 5m.                                   
 The soil is generally light and sandy 
 though fertile. Near the river it is  
 rather peaty the higher areas are     
 somewhat heavier and flinty.          
 There are deposits of sand and gravel 
 in the south western corner of the    
 area.                                 
 To the west of the area are the       
 villages of Buxton and Lammas and in  
 the east the aerodrome of R.A.F       
 Coltishall. In between there is       
 extensive farmland.                   </content>
