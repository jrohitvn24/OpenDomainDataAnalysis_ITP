		<title>15Attitudes in Long Marton</title>
		<content> Most people like living in our block. 
 They say the people are friendly and  
 helpful.They enjoy country life and   
 the fresh air.They would not like the 
 noise,crush and fumes in a big city.  
    There are however,somethings they  
 would like to change.Everybody said   
 they would like to see less litter.   
 They would like a better bus servise  
 and a bigger playing field for the ch-
 ildren.Some would like a library and  
 more shops.                           
    They would like to see pets kept   
 under control rather than just left to
 wonder about and make a mess every-   
 where.                                
    The station is closed at Long Mart-
 on but many people would like to see  
 more regular local servise between    
 Appleby and Carlisle for shopping or  
 getting to the Technical Collage.Now  
 no trains run at the right time.      </content>
