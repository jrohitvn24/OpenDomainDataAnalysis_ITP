		<title>08Wareham Housing.</title>
		<content> Houses most in demand are small,2 to  
 3 bedroomed houses under Â£40,000 and  
 first floor flats for elderly.Some    
 houses are turned into holiday homes. 
 Young married couples need houses at  
 Â£25_30,000 and later progress to      
 larger accomodation.This is a problem 
 because of a shortage of suitable     
 priced houses.Ensors get about 4 to 5 
 thousand enquiries a year but only 100
 to 200 houses are purchased.Most of   
 the applications are from outside     
 Wareham,from people trying to move    
 into a house in a more rural area.    
 Ensors find that most of their        
 customers are satisfied with their    
 range of properties for sale in the   
 area.
