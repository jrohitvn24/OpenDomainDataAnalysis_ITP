		<title>01BISHOP'S TAWTON AND LANDKEY</title>
		<content> These two areas are mainly rural with 
 some housing estates surrounded by    
 many farms. The River Taw runs through
 Bishop's Tawton and the main railway  
 from Barnstaple to Exeter also runs   
 through Bishop's Tawton. Both Landkey 
 and Bishop's Tawton have a Parish     
 Church and there are also churches of 
 other denominations in the area as    
 well. In between Landkey and Bishop's 
 Tawton is Codden Hill on which is the 
 monument erected to the memory of     
 Caroline Thorpe the wife of the former
 leader of the Liberal Party. Within   
 the area is one of the two            
 Comprehensive schools in Barnstaple   
 and it serves the children of both    
 Landkey and Bishop's Tawton and the   
 surrounding villages.
