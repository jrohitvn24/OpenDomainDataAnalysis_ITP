		<title>16EVENTS IN CODICOTE/WELWYN</title>
		<content>  The 1985 Codicote Village Day, opened
 by Mr. Norris McWhirter, was combined 
 with the official opening of the "John
 Clements Memorial Pavilion" built with
 Â£15,000 raised locally to commemorate 
 a teacher from Codicote who died      
 trying to save school children in an  
 Italian hotel fire in 1976, for which 
 he was awarded the George Cross.      
  There were many displays, events,    
 sideshows and stalls by village       
 organisations.                        
  The annual Welwyn Festival Week      
 oprganised by the local Round Table in
 June opens with Street Market stalls  
 manned by local groups, proceeds going
 to these organisations.               
  Day and evening events such as       
 village tours led by a local archeolo-
 gist, Wild West shows, barbeques etc. 
 culminate in a Carnival Parade through
 the village to Danesbury Hospital Fete</content>
