		<title>20Pollution</title>
		<content> In this beautiful part of the         
 Cotswolds there are several things    
 which pollute the area.               
  The most noticeable pollutant is     
 aircraft noise. Aircraft from at least
 five different bases overfly the area.
  When Concorde was being developed at 
 Fairford the noise was deafening      
 though the plane was a stunning sight.
  This kind of pollution, although     
 disturbing when it occurs, only lasts 
 for a short while.                    
  A far more sinister form of pollution
 which affects the whole of this county
 are the gases which come from the     
 Avonmouth industrial complex sixty    
 kilometres away.Tests carried out in  
 Hatherop show the presence of sulphur 
 dioxide in the air.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
