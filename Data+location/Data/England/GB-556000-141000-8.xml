		<content>  The buildings of Southborough,High   
Brooms and surrounding area reflect the
growth of the town and local building  
materials,oak,brick and sandstone.     
  The earliest houses in the area were 
built of oak, but few examples still   
survive.The fine local clay meant that 
brick was used for the 19th century    
buildings in Southborough.             
  The building before 1914 was         
haphazard: some terraced housing and   
some large villas which are now mostly 
demolished or divided into flats.      
  An interesting local feature is the  
use of bricks or setts  for paving.    
They are characteristic of the area    
and are regrettably being removed and  
replaced by tarmac.It is also          
unfortunate that many brick houses     
are being painted white and the slate  
roofs being replaced by modern tiles.
