		<content> THE AREA COVERED IN THIS INFORMATION  
 DEALS WITH 12SQ.KM. TO THE NORTH AND  
 EAST OF ROCHDALE TOWN CENTRE.         
  The area is a combination of built up
 land,agricultural land and moorland.  
 There is little to be found in the way
 of industry due to the recession and  
 decline of the cotton industry.Many   
 people are employed in the service    
 industries or out of the area.        
  The four 1km. squares in the north   
 are sparsely populated.Wardle and     
 Healey are both linear villages.      
 Between them may be found rough       
 moorland and several dairy farms.Going
 further south we come to the          
 residential areas and area of light   
 industry bordering on the town centre.
  The area is serviced by road links to
 the M62.and the surrounding towns of  
 Oldham,Bury,Littleborough,Middleton   
 and Manchester.                       </content>
