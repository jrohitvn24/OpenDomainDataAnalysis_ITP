		<title>17LANDSCAPE _ WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   This area is mainly{lowland pasture,
 with many{RHYNES}or ditches. The      
 village of{Wedmore}is situated in the 
 south on a clay_capped hill.          
   Climatically, the predominantly SW  
 winds and the shadow effect of the    
 Bristol Channel, produce a lower than 
 expected rainfall.                    
  {Rhynes}are man_made water courses,  
 built in the 14th century by monks to 
 help drain the land. The water level  
 is kept high in the summer months to  
 allow the rhynes to act as fences and 
 kept at a low level for the rest of   
 the year to prevent flooding.         
   Local farmers are responsible for   
 the maintainence of the small ditches,
 Wessex Water Authority for the rhynes.
   The drainage system in this area is 
 designed to take the water from the   
 lowlands, via the rhynes and rivers,  
 to the Bristol Channel.               </content>
