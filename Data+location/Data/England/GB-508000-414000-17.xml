		<content> My Dad gets up very early in the      
 morning in order to get to work on    
 time because he works at Burton       
 Stather near Scunthorpe. It takes him 
 thirty minutes or more to get there.  
 My Dad's work is at the bottom of a   
 big hill, and the wharf is called     
 Kings Ferry Wharf and it is at the    
 side of the River Trent. It has many  
 boats, mainly cargo boats and ferries.
 My Dad ships in steel and timber.     
 There is one big black crane and two  
 small white and orange ones. My Dad is
 Manager. When we go to the Sailing    
 Club in the Summer we see a lot of    
 lorries bringing coal from Germany.   
 There are lots of places now on the   
 Humber River where ships can unload.  
 The places are very muddy and         
 dangerous. Coal makes our boats dirty 
 and we have to keep washing them.
