		<title>13THE JOURNEY TO KNOTT END.</title>
		<content>   Only walkers can cross to Knott End 
 from Fleetwood by ferry, but Knott End
 is a place in which to walk. Looking  
 back, the very short river trip makes 
 the absence of a bridge surprising,   
 but when one is strolling along the   
 esplanade gazing out over broad sands 
 and quiet waters, or walking through  
 lanes looking over lush green dairy   
 farmland, its absence seems welcome.  
 The Fleetwood/Knott End ferry used to 
 run a service boat called the Bourne  
 May after the family that once owned  
 Hackensall Hall;they then sold it to  
 I.C.I.., now the main employer of the 
 people of Fleetwood.The history of the
 Fleetwood/Knott End relationship is a 
 tapestry interwoven with the names of 
 Hesketh,Bourne May,Ashworth, Rawcliffe
 and Baines and it is only possible    
 to appreciate the present state of the
 two areas in the light of their past. </content>
