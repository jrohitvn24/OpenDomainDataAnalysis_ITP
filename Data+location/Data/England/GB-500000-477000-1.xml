		<title>01Staxton Area</title>
		<content>  North of the block is flat farmland  
 of the Derwent floodplain. mainly     
 grassland for stock grazing and some  
 other crops. The A64 runs across the  
 block and nearby there are three      
 villages, mainly residential with some
 farms. Further south is the steep     
 Staxton Brow, the north edge of te    
 wolds when the chalklands rise to an  
 area of arable farms with plantations 
 on the steeper slopes. The south is   
 all hilly arable farmland and some    
 grazing. There are a few farms but    
 most residnts live near the main roads
 in the north and presumably  work     
 outside the block, which is close     
 to Scarborough. There is some caravan 
 site developemnt as the area is quite 
 convenient for tourists to reach      
 coastal and National park locations.  
 The coutnryside in the south is quite 
 attractive and much visited           </content>
