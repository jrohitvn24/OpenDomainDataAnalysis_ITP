		<title>18YOUTH AND LEISURE.</title>
		<content>   Leisure facilities are scarce for   
 youngsters in the area apart from     
 tennis courts and facilities in parks 
 and private clubs, such as{cricket.   
 The bowling green is, of course, used 
 by the elderly and the nearest leisure
 centre is in Altrincham. There used to
 be a cinema in Hale but this was      
 demolished only to be replaced by     
 privately owned flats. The annual{Rose
{Queen Festival,}in June, attracts many
 groups, such as the scouts, guides,   
 bands and morris dancers but on the   
 whole children have either to travel  
 to Altrincham or save their money.    
 There are three primary schools in the
 area but many eleven year olds        
 interviewed seem to rely heavily upon 
 their parents for transport,          
 especially after school. On the whole 
 many children seem isolated and{bored 
 and need direction in their leisure.  </content>
