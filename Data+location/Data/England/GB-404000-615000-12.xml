		<title>12A typical day at our school</title>
		<content> School begins at nine o'clock but most
 people get there about ten minutes    
 early. Only four people usually walk  
 to school. The other twentyfour people
 have to be brought by cars.           
 As soon as we get to school we come   
 straight in and look to see what we   
 have to do first. (Our teacher writes 
 it down on a pad so we can get started
 straight away.)                       
 We stop for Assembly at about ten     
 o'clock. The little class come to join
 us. After that we go out into the yard
 to play. The milkman who is Jeremy's  
 dad usually brings the milk at        
 playtime. Sometimes we work outside   
 doing estimating and measuring or     
 drawing. We eat our dinner in the     
 class room. We put tablecloths over   
 the desks. On Tuesday and Thursdays we
 do P.E. outside. We usually end the   
 day with a story or quiet reading.    </content>
