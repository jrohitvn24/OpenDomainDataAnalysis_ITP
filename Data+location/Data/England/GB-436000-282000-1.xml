 of the City of Coventry and parts of  
 rural Warwickshire.                   
 The{Coventry}section consists of part 
 of the area known as{Wood End}which is
 mainly council housing built in the   
 1950's and 60's.This area has many    
 social problems.The rest of the       
 Coventry area under study is the area 
 known as{Potters Green}which is mainly
 1960's private housing,with a much    
 lesser degree of social problems.There
 are some small industrial premises in 
 the areas.Coventry is currently in the
{West Midlands County}but is due to    
 revert to Warwickshire in 1987.       
 The {Warwickshire}area is mainly      
 rural with the small villages of{Ansty

 is both a dormitory for Coventry and  
 well-established farmland.
