		<title>05MORTE POINT</title>
		<content>     This tongue of land stretches into
 the sea with Woolacombe on one side   
 and Lee and Ilfracombe on the other.  
 Cromlechs and other ancient relics    
 link us with countless human beings   
 who have enjoyed this lovely place    
 from time immemorial.  A stone erected
 on the highest point remembers the men
 of Mortehoe who kept watch here during
 the last war.  It is possible to walk 
 on the Point for hours and still not  
 explore all the many paths which climb
 and dip over hilly, rocky terrain.    
 Throughout the year flowers greet us -
 violets, primroses, bluebells, wild   
 roses, heather, seapinks, gorse, and  
 many others. Seabirds weave patterns  
 overhead, and seals sport themselves  
 on the rocks.  The National Coastal   
 Footpath traverses the entire Point.  
 To stand precariously on the rocky tip
 surveying the Morte Stone, is awesome.</content>
