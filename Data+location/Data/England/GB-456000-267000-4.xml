		<title>04Recreation in Ashby</title>
		<content>Some of the hobbies that the people of 
Ashby do are crafts of various sorts,  
flower arranging,baking,sewing and     
dancing.                               
  There is a playing field for the     
children which has got swings,a slide, 
and parallel bars.                     
  There is no cricket field or football
pitch.The only people who go riding are
the owners of the pub.They keep horses 
and may go riding with the Pytchley    
hunt.                                  
  There are footpaths from Ashby to    
Barby,Kilsby,Welton,Braunston and      
Watford.The local wildlife may be seen 
on walks along these paths-the         
increasing number of badgers,monkjack  
deer,foxes,rabbits,hares and pheasants.
Unfortunately Dutch elm disease led to 
the felling of over 2,000 elms in 1978,
but new plantings include sycamorere,  
oak,ash and rowan trees.               </content>
