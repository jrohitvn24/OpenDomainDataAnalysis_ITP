{provides daycare for the elderly},

  Mrs. Catherine Shaw ,having retired  
 and moved from the busy built-up East 
 End of London to live with her        
 daughter in the relatively peaceful   
 greenery of{Harlow}, often arranges to
 meet her friends there ,where she does

  Situated in the Town Park ,the centre
 is named after{Leah Manning},the local
 M.P. who organised welfare clinics in 
 the New Town ,known as "Pram Town"
