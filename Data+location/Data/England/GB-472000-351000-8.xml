		<content> Generally people feel quite{satisfied}
 with their way of life and indeed many
 have moved here specifically to enjoy 
 the peaceful environment and more     
 exclusive lifestyle which is typical  
 of the area.                          
 It is seen by most as a{friendly}place
 to live although some{conflict}exists 
 between the original inhabitants and  
 the newer, more mobile incomers.      
 The younger people feel that there is 
 a lack of organised{entertainment.}   
 Parents acknowledge this and are      
 usually willing to provide{transport} 
 for their offspring to nearby towns.  
 Youngsters expect to run a car at 18.

 think that they should be allowed to  
 do as they like on their own land but 
 others agree with it because it offers
 them some protection from unwelcome   
 speculation and development.          </content>
