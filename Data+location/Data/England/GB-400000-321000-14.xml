Colwich Station was at the junction of 
the North Staffordshire Railway with   
the London North Western Railway. The  
Station House has recently been sand   
blasted, removing the grime of years   
and the soot of the Age of Steam,      
revealing a fine example of            
Staffordshire Railway architecture. A  
footbridge still crosses the lines but 
the level crossing, sidings, turntable,
water tower and signal box have long   
gone, soon after the closure of the    
station in 1954. The road was cut under
the railway lines as the amount of road
traffic increased making it            
impracticable to use a level crossing  
on the main line to London. Railway    
workers were housed in two terraces,   
one on each side of the brigde over the
road. These are now privately owned,   
some by former railwaymen.             </content>
