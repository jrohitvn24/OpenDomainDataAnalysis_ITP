		<title>02Maristow Estate.</title>
		<content>  The main landowner is the Rt.        
 Honourable Henry Lopes. This estate   
 has been in the family since the      
 1720's. The first owner being Sir     
 Ralph Lopes. The estate has passed    
 down to the present Lord Roborough's  
 son, Mr. Henry who took over in 1975. 
  At one time there had been as much as
 960 acres and some 62 farms. Today    
 there are some 620 acres with a great 
 reduction in farms and farm workers. A
 government scheme encouraged the      
 amalgamation of adjacent farms,grants 
 were awarded for the removing of      
 hedges, thus accomodating larger more 
 modern machinery. While beef cattle   
 have been the predominant source of   
 income, two flocks of sheep,deep      
 litter hens and pig farming are also  
 an important part of farm life,along  
 with the showing of South Devon and   
 Jersey cattle.                        </content>
