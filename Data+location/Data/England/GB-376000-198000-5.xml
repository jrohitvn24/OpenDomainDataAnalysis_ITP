		<content>  I get up at 7-30am wash,dress and    
 have my  breakfast.My mother drives me
 to school which is 5 miles away.School
 starts at 9-00am with class           
 registration.Then the whole school    
 goes into assembly.After assembly we  
 return to class and work hard until   
 playtime at 10-40am.When break is over
 we return to class and work until     
 lunch at 12-00 midday.After lunch we  
 have about an hours play.In the       
 afternoon I go to a different class   
 for project work.We do our project    
 work until 3-00pm when we have story  
 which lasts until school finishes at  
 3-00pm.When I get home I usually watch
 television until I have my tea.After  
 tea I read a book or help my mother   
 until it is time for me to go to bed  
 This is usually about 9-00pm.
