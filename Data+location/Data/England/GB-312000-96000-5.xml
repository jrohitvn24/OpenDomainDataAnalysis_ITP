		<title>05THE COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> Despite the lack of a pub and a school
 there is a strong community in the    
 village. The major institutions are   
 the Church, the Women's Institute and 
 the Parish Hall, with the Parish      
 Council acting for the local          
 authority.                            
 The Church is well supported. Most of 
 the children attend the Sunday School 
 regularly, and congregations include a
 significent proportion of the         
 population for the major festivals.   
 The Women's Institute meets regularly 
 and runs the annual Flower and Produce
 show, one of the highlights of the    
 year. The Parish Hall committee       
 organise social and fund-raising      
 events including the children's       
 Christmas party. In traditional       
 village style everyone knows everyone 
 and there is still time, and space, to
 gossip in the middle of the street.   </content>
