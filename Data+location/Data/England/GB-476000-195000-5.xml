		<content>           OUR FARM VISIT.             
                                       
 One Thursday in June we walked across 
 the fields to{Golden  Acre Farm.}Mr.  
 Pitcher, the farmer,told us he only   
 has 20 acres so it is officially      
 called a smallholding.(A farm is 50   
 acres.)                               
     We didn't see many animals as     
 his chickens are over at{Andridge     
{Farm,}which he rents.                 
     During the summer he uses all his 
 fields for{hay_making}&amp; raises{beef   
{cattle}during the winter months,when  
 they are feeding on the hay.          
     We were able to see five horses   
 though,one of which is a Gypsy horse. 
 His horses are shoed by Mr Aslett, our
 farrier.He also showed us his three   
 tractors and farming implements.One of
 them was an old 1943 Ferguson TE20.
