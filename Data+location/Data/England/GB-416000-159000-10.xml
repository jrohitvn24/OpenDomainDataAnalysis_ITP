		<content> There was a church in PEWSEY in Saxon 
 times. Onthe south side of the        
 present buiding can be seen several   
 stones.                               
 There are thought to be foundations   
 of the tiny church of{KING ALFRED'S   
 time.Later a Norman church of stone   
 was built in a much smaller size than 
 the existing church .                 
 During Mediaeval times much           
 enlargement took place. The roof was  
 raised, the tower was built and the   
 present pillars were cut from the     
 original Norman walls.                
 The altar rails were made of wood     
 given by Lord Nelson.                 
 The parish register began in 1586.    
 The church is dedicated to St John the
 Baptist.
