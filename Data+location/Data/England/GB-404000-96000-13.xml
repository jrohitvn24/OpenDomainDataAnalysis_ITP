		<title>13DUDSBURY CAMP_GUIDING.</title>
		<content> In 1931 the Dorset Girl Guides were   
 allowed to buy the site at Dudsbury   
 from Lord Wimborne for a nominal sum  
 provided the land was kept in regular 
 use by the Girl Guides.Should it not  
 be the  case then the land reverts to 
 the estate.                           
     Over the years people have bought 
 nearby land in memory of members of   
 their families to enlarge the site.   
 Anne's meadow is an example of        
 this.Buildings on the site have also  
 been added in memory of Guiders etc.  
     There is a modern main hut with   
 excellent facilities recently added   
 for the disabled.Showers,toilets and  
 even a deep freeze are on site for use
 by Brownies on Pack holidays and      
 Guides either camping in the open or  
 inside the huts. A permanent campfire 
 site is in frequent use by the Guides 
 from all over England who use the site</content>
