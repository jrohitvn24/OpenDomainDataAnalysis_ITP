		<title>16RECREATION, KIRKBY UNDERWOOD</title>
		<content>  Being a rural area recreation/leisure
 lends itself to country sports and    
 pursuits such as hunting, shooting,   
 walking and horse-riding.             
   Temple Wood is good for walking as  
 is neighbouring Callan Lane Wood which
 has waymarked walks and a picnic area.
 Bird watching and nature study are    
 also held in these woods.             
   The area is hunted by the Belvoir   
 Hunt and there are pheasant, pigeon   
 and rabbit shoots during the season.  
   Kirkby Underwood has a flourishing  
 Women's Institute which holds monthly 
 meetings in the village hall; at      
 present there are eighteen members.   
   Bourne Kart Club holds monthly      
 meetings during the summer at a grass 
 track on land owned by Mr.Green of    
 Kirkby Underwood, as do a group of    
 archers, the Robin Hood Society, who  
 exercise in Temple Wood.              </content>
