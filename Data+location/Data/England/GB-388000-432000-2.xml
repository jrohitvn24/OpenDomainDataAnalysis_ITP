         THE  MOORS                    
                                       
  There are 7 square kilometres of     
 Extwistle Moor, which can only be     
 described as inhospitable. A scenic   
 minor road from Burnley to Halifax    
 clips one corner, but this is now only
 used by local traffic and weekend     
 motorists looking for good picnic     
 spots and a little peace and quiet.   
 The rest of the moorland contains only
 one footpath and one bridle track     
 frequented by walkers, equestrians and
 rough riding motor-cyclists. The      
 underlying rock is millstone grit and 
 is covered with rough grass and       
 heather on which a few hardy sheep    
 graze.The whole moor is a catchment   
 area for the seven reservoirs that    
 circle it and is owned by the North   
 West Water Authority.                 </content>
