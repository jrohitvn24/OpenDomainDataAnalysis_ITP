		<title>09Shopping in Taddington</title>
		<content>    There is only one village shop in  
 Taddington,which is also the post     
 office.The shop sells many things     
 besides groceries.Half day closing is 
 on Mondays.Many older people buy all  
 their groceries there but a lot of    
 families visit the supermarkets at    
 Buxton,Bakewell and Chesterfield. At  
 one time travellers from Tideswell and
 Bakewell grocers took orders and the  
 goods were delivered a few days later.
    The shop was a chapel until 1927.  
 The old post office has been converted
 into a house.That too was a shop for  
 many years.A bread van comes twice a  
 week,a greengrocer on Tuesdays,and a  
 fishmonger on Wednesdays.A van selling
 all kinds of foodstuffs also comes    
 once a week.Milk is delivered daily by
 two firms.The butcher's shop closed   
 down a few years ago and now fresh    
 meat has to be bought elsewhere.      </content>
