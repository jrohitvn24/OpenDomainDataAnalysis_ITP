		<content> WOODLANDS AND SMALL COPSES ARE        
 SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE AREA. A FEW  
 LARGE HOUSES ARE ON THE SOUTH FACING  
 SLOPE AND THESE ARE SURROUNDED BY     
 THEIR OWN TREE COVERED GARDENS. TREES 
 OF OAK, BEECH, SYCAMORE, ASH ,WITH    
 CONIFERS OF MORE EXOTIC SPECIES IN    
 MINORITY. SPECIES OF LARCH, PINES,    
 CEDARS, FIRS ARE MOST COMMON. THE     
 LARGEST AREA OF WOODLAND (APPROX. 150 
 ACRES) BELONGS TO TRACEY HOUSE AND IS 
 OF BROADLEAVED SPECIES. THE PARKLAND  
 SURROUNDING THE HOUSE HAS CEDARS,     
 PINES, WELLINGTONIAS, AND OTHERS OF 80
 TO 100 YEARS OLD. CERTAIN TREES IN    
 HONITON HAVE PRESERVATION ORDERS. THE 
 FARMERS INTERVIEWED WERE MOSTLY       
 INTERESTED IN WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ON
 THEIR FARMS. SOME HAVE SMALL COPSES   
 THAT THEY LEAVE FOR WILDLIFE. MOST    
 ONLY CUT DEAD OR DYING TREES FOR      
 FIREWOOD.                             </content>
