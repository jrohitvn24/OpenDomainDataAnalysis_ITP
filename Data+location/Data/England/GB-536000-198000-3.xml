		<title>03NEWSPAPER STORIES (12.7.85)</title>
		<content> We made a comparison between the      
 stories on the front page of two local
 papers, looking at those from 5.7.85  
 (see page 2) and 12.7.85.             
 The closure of Waltham Abbey's{Honey  
{Lane Hospital}is still the main story 
 in one of the papers. This hospital   
 caters for psychogeriatric and        
 geriatric patients in the district.   
 The{West Essex Health Authority}want  
 to shut it (making an annual saving of
{Â£500,000}a year).                     
 At a recent Waltham Abbey Church      
{fete,}Â£1,500 was raised.              
 Other stories include the theft of car
 tyres from a local garage, and the    
 poor quality of certain bus routes in 
 the area.                             
 The result of the Waltham Abbey Town  
 Council{lottery}is also announced on  
 the front page. This week the first   
 prize was{Â£245.                       </content>
