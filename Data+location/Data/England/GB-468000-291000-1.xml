		<title>01LANDSCAPE FARMING HABITATION</title>
		<content>   This area is predominately open     
 countryside which is good quality     
 farmland. This is put either to       
 pasture or cereals although some      
 kale is grown for fodder. Sheep are   
 raised and also cattle, both for      
 fattening and milk production. The    
 whole area is bisected north west     
 to south east by a major road, the    
 A6, and also the main Leicester to    
 St. Pancras railway line. Also a      
 length of the Grand Union canal       
 meanders through the southern         
 section of the area. Housing is       
 sparse over most of the area,         
 except in the main centres of         
 habitation, the villages of           
 Kibworth Beauchamp and Smeeton        
 Westerbylocated in the north          
 western corner.A number of quite      
 new housing developments extend       
 from Kibworth Beauchamp.              </content>
