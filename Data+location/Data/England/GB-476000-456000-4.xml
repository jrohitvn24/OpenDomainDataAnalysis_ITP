		<content>      At seven o'clock in the morning I
 wake up because my clock radio comes  
 on and I listen to it for half an hour
 before I get up.  When I have dressed 
 I go downstairs and turn on the       
 television to watch "Breakfast Time". 
 At 8.30 a.m. me and my mum set off in 
 the Mini to school.  At about 9.30    
 after assembly we start our proper    
 work which is Maths or English.  At   
 11.50 the boys go into the hall to set
 up the tables for lunch after that the
 servers go and set the tables and     
 everybody comes in at 12.00.  A good  
 dinner would be Chips, Beans and Meat 
 with Rainbow Sponge and Custard.      
 After dinner we go to play football   
 until 1.00.  In the afternoon we use  
 the computer do our Topic, Science,   
 Art, Music or Games.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
