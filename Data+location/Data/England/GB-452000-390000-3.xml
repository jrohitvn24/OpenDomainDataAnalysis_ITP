		<title>03Landscape Around Maltby</title>
		<content> The Maltby district is part of a      
 gently sloping dip-slope of Magnesian 
 limestone. Near the western margins   
 this reaches 120 metres OD,declining  
 to below 70 metres in the east. The   
 dip slope is cut into by the steep    
 sided valley of Maltby Dyke, where the
 limestone is exposed in impressive    
 crags. Much of the dip slope is good  
 arable farmland,but the steeper valley
 sides form areas of rough grass,scrub 
 and woodland of higher landscape and  
 amenity value. East of the town is a  
 poorly drained area of common land,now
 designated a SSSI.In the east Sandbeck
 Park,the estate of Lord Scarbrough,has
 game coverts and plantations adding to
 the scenery.Northeast the colliery    
 spoil heap and stone quarries mar the 
 landscape.Thus man has both improved  
 and scarred the landscape.
