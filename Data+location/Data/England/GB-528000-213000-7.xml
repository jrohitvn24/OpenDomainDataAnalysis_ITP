		<title>07PANSHANGER STABLES</title>
		<content>    Panshanger Stables are situated in 
 the old stable yard belonging to the  
 Panshanger Estate.Panshanger was built
 about 300 years ago.The person now    
 running the stables hes been there for
 about eight years,but there has been a
 riding school there for the last 25   
 years.                                
    The riding school owner leases the 
 stables and 19 acres of land from the{
{Redland Gravel Company}.They have 16  
 stalls and 9 loose boxes.             
    The stables are open every day from
 10 o'clock until 7 o'clock in the     
 evening during the summer,but not as  
 late in winter.                       
    The stables are a full time job.The
 lady works very hard with all the     
 mucking out,grooming etc.The rest of  
 the family do not help but two people 
 come in and work part time.
