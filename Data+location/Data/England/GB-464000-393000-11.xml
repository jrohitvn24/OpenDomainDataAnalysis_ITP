		<title>11The Manor House,Austerfield</title>
		<content>  The restored Elizabethan Manor House 
 is white with black woodwork and a red
 tiled roof.It is a Tudor yeoman's     
 house with two stories and the birth  
 place of William Bradford in 1590.He  
 sailed in the Mayflower and became the
 second governor of Massachusetts.     
 Flowers grow on each side of the brick
 pathway leading to the front door.In  
 front of the house is an Elizabethan  
 pig wall.In the courtyard is a rusty  
 water pump underneath which is a stone
 trough used by animals.This pump also 
 has a tiled roof.In the centre is a   
 pretty island flowerbed.              
  At right angles to the house are     
 former stables with servants quarters 
 above.Next to this is a greenhouse    
 containing many plants and garden     
 equipment.Close to the greenhouse is a
 huge water tank used to water the     
 plants.                               </content>
