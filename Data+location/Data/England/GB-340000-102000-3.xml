 groceries, sweets,frozenfoods,fruit   
 and many more.  The shopkeeper is very
 friendly and helpful. Most people go  
 to the nearby towns of Crewkerne and  
 Bridport to buy their groceries but   
 the villlage shop is good for old     
 people. Two of the other shops make   
 and repair wooden things. One of the  
 shops is called Dorset pines the other
 is called Chairs and crafts.There is  
 another shop called the church book   
 shop it sells books about church and  
 religion.
