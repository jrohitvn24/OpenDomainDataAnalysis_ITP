		<content>    First its  getting up. Mum shouts  
 hurry up, you'll be late for school.I 
 have to wash and get dressed before   
 breakfast.When breakfast has finished 
 its off to school.When we get in class
 first its registration then its Maths 
 up until playtime.We go on the field  
 until we have to go in.When  we get in
 class two people are working on the   
 computer while the others are doing   
 English.After dinner we do some       
 reading.When we do games we play      
 stoolball, rounders, cricket,         
 athletics and softball. After play we 
 have a story or drama,word games or   
 four in a row,which is a number game. 
 Then its home time.When I get home I  
 watch television until tea time after 
 which I play cricket or tennis with my
 sister.On schooldays 8.30 p.m. is my  
 bedtime although at weekends I stay up
 a little later.                       </content>
