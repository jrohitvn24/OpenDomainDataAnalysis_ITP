		<content>    It is  in  this  field  that modern
 tecnology  has really made an  impact.
 31%  of  the  children  surveyed  had 
 access  to  a  computer  in the  home.
 Adventure  games, where  the  result  
 depends  upon  the decisions  that the
 children  make  themselves,  Space -  
 Invaders  and games based on  T.V.  or
 Cinema Films are popular.             
   Videos  provide  another  source  of
 home entertainment.  39% of the survey
 children had a video in the home. T.V.
 also  sparked off  interest  in  other
 games.  Snooker and  table tennis  are
 examples, as is  charades,  a game  of
 mime, when a team has to guess a title
 of  a  book, film  or  play  from  the
 actions of one person.                
   Board  games  too are still popular.
 Scrabble, a word game, and Monopoly, a
 game of buying property, are played by
 many children.                        </content>
