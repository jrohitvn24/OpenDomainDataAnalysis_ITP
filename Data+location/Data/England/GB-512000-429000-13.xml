		<content>  AN INTERVIEW WITH {ROY HOLDSTOCK}    
 OF HULL KINGSTON ROVERS.              
{How many games do you play a season?  
  About 46.                            
{What do you enjoy about a rugby match?
  The fact that for 80 minutes you     
 knock hell out of each other but      
 afterwards everyones friends and bears
 no malice.                            
{What do you think of all the recent   
{crowd violence at football matches?   
  It disgusts me to see lads kicking   
 the hell out of each other for no     
 apparent reason than to brag about it 
 to a friend. If they want to let off  
 steam why dont they visit a local gym 
 or join a football or rugby team.     
  I think that if my two boys were     
 involved I am almost certain I would  
 be able to spot it and take steps to  
 avoid it. Who's to blame? Parents? Who
 knows?                                </content>
