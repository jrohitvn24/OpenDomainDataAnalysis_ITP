		<content> The Humblebee cottages used to be the 
 stables of the Old Manor house.When   
 the Manor was knocked down the stables
 were converted to three cottages.One  
 is owned  by the Harbury Postmaster   
 who used it at weekends.There are     
 plans to restore the cottages.The     
 empty cottages can be visited and     
 local children use them to play in.The
 inside walls are made of wattle and   
 daub.The metal fire places have a     
 clothes boiler at one end and a bake  
 oven at the other.The cottages have   
 one room upstairs and one downstairs  
 but one end cottage had the staircase 
 moved so that an extra room could be  
 built on.
