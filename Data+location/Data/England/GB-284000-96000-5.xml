   Sherwood House is owned by Mr.and   
 Mrs.J.Quicke.There are {22 rooms      
{including 11 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.
 We noticed a{piano made in 1820,}a    
{Chinese musical box,}a Chinese chest  
 of drawers and{many old paintings.    
{  The owners live mainly in two rooms 
{downstairs and two upstairs,since     
{their six children are now grown up.  
   Mrs. Quicke allowed us to report    
 that her bed was tilted because she   
 suffered from varicose veins!         
   The house,built in 1907,is on four  
 sides of a courtyard,the beautiful,   
 grounds have{unusual plants and trees 
 in a wild setting.{The deer - and the 
{giant wood ants,which infest the area 
{- are a nuisance.}There are pyramid   
 shaped hedges, a summer house still in
 use,and a lot of beehives.There are   
 two fish ponds.                       </content>
