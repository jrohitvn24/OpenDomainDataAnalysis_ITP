		<title>13Keeping a toad in school</title>
		<content> When we searched for minibeasts one of
 our girls found a little toad under a 
 stone.Teacher let us keep "him" in the
 classroom providing we fed and cared  
 for him. Into a fish tank we put:-    
 6-7cm damp sand, a deep layer of good 
 loam soil sloping up, a small dish of 
 clean water at the lower end, we added
 moss, bark, a dark-brown wide-necked  
 rectangular glass bottle for him to   
 creep inside, a small jar of water    
 with fresh dock leaves, a shady place,
 somewhere to climb &amp; perch.In a little
 vivarium we kept his prey, with grass 
 &amp; a piece of rotten wood. We weighed &amp;
 measured him nearly every day. We     
 part-filled the sink with luke warm   
 water &amp; popped him in to swim -       
 breaststroke at first, sometimes with 
 his arms straight at sides,           
 streamlining himself,leg kicks only.  
 After 4 weeks we released him.        </content>
