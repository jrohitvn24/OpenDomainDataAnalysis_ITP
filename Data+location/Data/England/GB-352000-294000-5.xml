		<content>   Silaging is a means of conserving   
 grass for use as winter feed for sheep
 and cattle. It starts at the beginning
 of April when Ammonium Nitrate is     
 applied to the young grass to promote 
 quick growth. About 8 weeks later we  
 cut with a 2.5 metre mower; this      
 machine also passes the grass through 
 2 rubber rollers which bruise it to   
 allow it to wilt faster. The crop is  
 then left for 24 hours to create a dry
 matter content of around 35% A baler  
 is used to make a cylinder-shaped bale
 1.6m long x 1m wide. The completed    
 bales are very dense and weigh about  
 350kg each. They are then taken for   
 stacking where each one is placed in  
 individual air-tight plastic bags.    
 Fermentation takes 8 weeks and the    
 silage is then ready for use.
