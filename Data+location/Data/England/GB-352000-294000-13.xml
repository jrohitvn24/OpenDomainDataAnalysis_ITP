		<title>13PLAISH HALL, SHROPSHIRE</title>
		<content>    The Manor of Plaish is mentioned in
 the original Domesday Book and part of
 the present imposing Hall dates from  
 the 15th century. A licence to rebuild
 the house as it stands today was      
 granted in 1520,and the decorated     
 brick chimneys are some of the finest 
 examples of Tudor chimney work in the 
 country. The present owner who lives  
 in the house has restored it carefully
 and faithfully, as far as is possible.
 Unfortunately the minstrel's gallery  
 was removed in the 1930's by a        
 previous owner. The grounds are in the
 process of being cleared and replanted
 at the present time.The plan is to    
 make the garden similar to those of   
 the Tudor period.When completed this  
 should be a showpiece in the County   
 and enhance the already attractive    
 hamlet of Plaish.
