		<content>{Killingholme Haven}was more of a      
 community than now.There were 8       
 houses and bungalows at the top of{   
{Station Road,}now demolished. The{    
{station,}was closed down in 1961. The 
 railway ran between the ferries at{New
{Holland and Immingham.}The buildings  
 no longer survive, except for the     
{station-master's house,}(an exact     
 replica of the one at East Halton).   
{ Buses}no longer serve the area.      
 The{school}has been knocked down; only
 the{school-house}stands. There is no  
 trace of the{General Store}down{Marsh 
{Lane.}Industry has brought some       
{benefits.}The houses were connected to
{mains}water and electricity. Before,  
 they used a{wind pump}in the station  
 yard. The lanes are also kept clear of
 snow in winter.
