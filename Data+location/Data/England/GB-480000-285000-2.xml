		<content>During the Second World War in 1942, a 
large area of flat, agricultural land  
was taken away from Rockingham Estates 
by the Ministry of Defence to be used  
as an airfield. Three concrete runways,
which formed a triangle were built and 
a perimeter track. Five enormous       
hangers of corrugated iron were built  
to house the aircraft. A camp for the  
airmen, quarters for the officers, a   
control tower, gun sites, ammunition   
and fuel dumps were constructed. The   
airfield was used as a training unit   
for many squadrons of the Royal Air    
Force between 1943 and 1945. They were 
trained to fly Wellington Bombers.     
Parts of these were repaired by        
Booklands Aviation Ltd, who used the   
United Counties Garage in Desborough.  
Many airmen who were trained here      
married local girls and settled in the 
surrounding area after the war.        </content>
