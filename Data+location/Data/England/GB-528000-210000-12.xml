		<title>12AMORES (HISTORIC HOUSE) I</title>
		<content>   The house is a timber framed        
 house built in 1485.It is built with a
 timber structure and has white plaster
 on the outside.The Seckers (previous  
 owners)have put a layer of stucco over
 the plaster.The timber frame is very  
 secure.Every time a beam falls out of 
 place the house gives a big squeal.A  
 speacilist visited the house and said 
 that 90 % of the beams could fall out 
 of place and the house would still    
 stand.So far 30% of the beams have    
 fallen out  of the place.Amores  got  
 it's name from a John Amores.It was   
 built of oak timbers slotted together.
 Some of the windows are georgian and  
 some victorian.Elizabeth Armstone once
 lived in Amores,she scratched her name
 on one of the windows.Mrs.Seckers     
 house is a tudor house and is nearly  
 five hundred years old.Round the back 
 there is an air raid shelther.]]]]]]  </content>
