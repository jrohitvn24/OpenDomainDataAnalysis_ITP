		<title>18A DAY IN LORRAINE'S LIFE</title>
		<content>{A normal Sunday}for me isn't just     
 staying at home with nothing to       
 do.This is how I usually spend my     
 Sundays:I get up at 8.30am,wash and   
{get my jodhpurs on,}I have a yoghurt  
 and a glass of orange for breakfast.  
 Then I put on my boots and coat pick  
 up my lunch box and get in the car.   
 After twenty minutes driving we reach 
{South Cerney Riding School.}I get a   
 broom and a pitchfork from the        
 feedroom,go into the yard and get a   
 wheelbarrow and start mucking out.At  
 12.30pm we have lunch.Afterwards{I get
{my pony ILISHE}from her field.I bring 
 her back,groom her,ride her in the    
 paddock then return her to the field. 
 at 4.00pm mum comes to take me home.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
