		<title>01Introduction, Bridgham Area</title>
		<content> Our area lies in Norfolk's Breckland: 
 a region of light sandy soil, with    
 heathland as the natural landcover.   
 However, in the last 50 years,        
 reafforestation has been followed by  
 land reclamation for farming.  Much of
 our block now shows a prosperous      
 forest and farming landscape, whilst  
 also retaining one of the best        
 remaining examples of the wild, sandy 
 heaths or brecks in the west of the   
 block.                                
                                       
 Bridgham village, a linear development
 along the Thetford_Harling road,      
 paralleling the River Thet, continues 
 into the neighbouring block; however, 
 information has been concentrated     
 within this block.  It is a small     
 community of approximately 250, stable
 in size and unlikely to grow within   
 the foreseeable future.               </content>
