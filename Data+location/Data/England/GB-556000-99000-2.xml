 THE DOWNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE
 AREA.THEY ARE A DESIGNATED AREA OF    
 OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY AND PART   
 IS CALLED THE EASTBOURNE HERITAGE     
 DOWNLAND. THE DOWNS ARE PATROLLED BY  
 RANGERS WHO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T       
 RUIN THEM. FARMERS GROW BARLEY AS A   
 MAIN CROP ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO HAVE     
 SHEEP AND CATTLE GRAZING.THERE ARE    
 MANY TRACKS AND PATHWAYS ON THE DOWNS 
 THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THEM IS THE     
 SOUTH DOWNS WAY.UNFORTUNATELY SOME    
 PEOPLE RIDE MOTORBIKES OVER THE DOWNS 
 WHICH DESTROYS THE PEACE.             
 MAN HAS LIVED ON THE DOWNS SINCE THE  
 STONE AGE AND YOU CAN FIND THE REMAINS
 OF HIS BURIAL MOUNDS AND FIELDS WHERE 
 HE GREW HIS CROPS. HE ALSO GREW       
 BARLEY.                               
                                       
                                       </content>
