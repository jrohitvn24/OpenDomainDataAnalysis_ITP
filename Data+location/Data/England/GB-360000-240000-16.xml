		<content>   On the estate nearly every child has
 a bike.They are mainly B.M.X's.Some   
 children have racers.There are about 3
 choppers and about 6 ladies bikes.    
 Some of the children smoke. At night  
 nearly all of us go down to the bus   
 shelter.Katie sometimes comes up to   
 exercise her pony.Sometimes we play   
 tennis,squash,1.2.3 home,rounders,    
 races,rollerbooting,football and      
 rugby.In the summer we sunbathe while 
 we are listening to pop songs.        
  Not all the children live on the     
 estate but they come up because it is 
 boring where they live.We sometimes   
 just sit on the bench and talk.       
   Some of the people go down to the   
 pub and go into the games room to play
 snooker.There is an air rifle club in 
 the Foley Arms.The children are also  
 allowed to use the school playing     
 field.                                </content>
