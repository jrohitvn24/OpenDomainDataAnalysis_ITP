The farm house,it was thought,was built
in the 17th century.It's a 2 storied   
building of timber and brick with a 1  
story extension. The extension was     
added in 1890 when part of the house   
was demolished. In the farmyard there  
are two barns an old timber/oak 17     
century one and a metal Dutch barn of  
1936 which is used for storing hay and 
straw. A modern post war concrete barn 
is used for housing 25 store cattle.The
cattle are of Fresian crossed with     
Hereford,they all graze on 25 acres of 
high quality grassland.There are also  
stables made of wood with brick        
foundations.                           
The farm owner,Mr.Wooster is 87 years  
old and has lived in the farmhouse     
since 1911-1926. He keeps 3 Suffolk    
sheep.
