		<content>     They own{22 fields}and the average
 size of each is{11.5 acres.}The main  
 crop they grow is{grass for grazing   
 and to{make silage.}They also grow{2  
{fields of kale}to feed the cattle and 
 some{wheat.}This is the first year    
 they have grown wheat. They make      
{Vacuum silage}which is quite unusual  
 because it is stored differently. The 
 land is very good. It is{undulating}  
 and {well drained.                    
     They own 4{tractors,}a{3 furrow   
{plough,}a{rotor}for silage,{harrows,  
 a{muck spreader,}a{slurry tank,}and a 
{slurry silo}for liquid manure. The    
 slurry from the tank and the silo is  
 spread on the fields.                 
     The farm they own is really 2     
 farms combined into 1. Because of this
 there are 3 houses there. The owner of
 the farm lives in the main house.
