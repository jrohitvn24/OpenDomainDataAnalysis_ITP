		<title>19TENANT FARMING IN ROMSEY</title>
		<content> For Mr Dovey, a Romsey tenant farmer, 
 work begins at 7 am.  He rents 300    
 acres of land from Broadlands Estate. 
 Twenty years ago it cost Â£5 per acre a
 year, now it costs Â£35.  He has worked
 on Sparshot Farm all his life and will
 inherit the tenancy from his father.  
 He grows winter and spring barley,    
 hay and 15 acres of peas.  Mr Dovey   
 once had about 170 dairy cows but he  
 has switched to beef cattle.  He has  
 woodland where pheasants are bred for 
 shooting parties.  Some of Mr Dovey's 
 land was a gravel pit but it has now  
 been filled in and the ground is used 
 for poor grazing.  The oldest of his  
 farm buildings was built in the late  
 1800's.  He had a cow barn built in   
 1960 for a cost of Â£6,000 - now it    
 would cost Â£60,000.  He no longer     
 has regular employees but hires casual
 labour for haymaking.                 </content>
