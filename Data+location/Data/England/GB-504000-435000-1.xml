		<content>     The area contains three villages-{
{Woodmansey},{Dunswell} and {Thearne}. 
 It is bounded to the east by the      
 Hull-Beverley railway and to the west 
 by the {River Hull}.  To the south is 
 the city of {Kingston-upon-Hull}, and 
 to the north is the historic town of  
{Beverley}.                            
     Within this area the predominant  
 feature is farming and market         
 gardening on the flat fertile flood   
 plain of the River Hull .             
     Crossing this plain are two main  
 roads - the Beverley bypass ({A1079}),
 and the Hull - Beverley road ({A1174})
 which serves the villages.            
     Being a rural area amenities are  
 few and far between, though Barmston  
 drain does provide some recreational  
 opportunities for the local community.
