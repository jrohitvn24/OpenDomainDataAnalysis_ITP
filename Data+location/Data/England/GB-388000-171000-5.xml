 We have one old factory "Mattesons"   
 and one modern factory"Herman Miller" 
 and two industrial estates in our     
 block.We wanted to know why all the   
 factories didn't choose to be on an   
 industrial estate.On an industrial    
 estate the sites are usually          
 custom_built for the purpose.This     
 costs a lot of money because you have 
 to know how big you expect your       
 business to be in the future.You have 
 to fit your place out ready for       
 production.The good thing is that your
 factory can be easily found by        
 strangers to the area because you are 
 all together. You have good access to 
 your place and good loading and       
 parking facilities.
