		<title>09LIVING IN WEST WITTERING</title>
		<content> I live in West Wittering.It is the    
 most South Westerly point in West     
 Sussex.I like living in West Wittering
 because my hous is by the sea.My dad  
 runs a car park which is used by      
 visitors to the beach.Sometimes during
 the height of the season the queue of 
 cars waiting to enter the car park    
 stretches way along the main road to  
 Chichester.The highest number of cars 
 we had on one occasion in the car park
 was four thousand vehicles.I go to    
 West Wittering School in Pound Road.  
 The new school was opened by the      
 Duchess of Norfolk in 1981.It was a   
 great occasion for the village.We had 
 a special church service.In the       
 village there is an old church,a      
 nursing home,several shops,a service  
 station,a restruant,a public house and
 an old sheep wash.
