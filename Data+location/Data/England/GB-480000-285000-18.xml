   In Pipewell there is just one       
church, St.Mary's. It looks quite old, 
but was built in 1881. The church is   
very small, like the village. In fact  
it is the smallest church in           
Northamptonshire. It is built in the   
manner of a castle and has turrets and 
a small moat. The church has leaded    
glass windows which are in an arch     
shape. It has a small round metal white
tower with a weather cock on top.      
 There is an old shoe scraper by the   
old wooden door. Its small yard has    
less than 12 graves, some a few 100    
years old and some very recent. The    
church is very peaceful and is situated
at one end of the village, surounded   
by lush woodland. The boundary means   
that half the village is in the parish 
of Rushton and half in that belonging  
to Desborough.                         </content>
