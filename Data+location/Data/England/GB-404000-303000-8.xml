		<title>08THE ABATTOIR IN BROWNHILLS.</title>
		<content>   Ogley Hay School pupils visited the 
 abattoir which employs 50 people. They
 discovered that it had started as a   
 High Street butcher some 55 years     
 ago. They used to kill only their own 
 livestock but now they get animals    
 from all over the country.            
   The man who owns the business enjoys
 his work which involves supplying     
 pork, lamb and beef to customers all  
 over the West Midlands. The children  
 were pleased to find that they did not
 kill cows which have had calves, but  
 learned that they slaughtered lambs of
 about 3-12 months old as well as young
 pigs.                                 
   There are changes all the time in   
 this business. Recently they have     
 acquired a new hanging machine for    
 the sides of beef and soon they are   
 to purchase a glass freezer to freeze 
 meat more quickly.                    </content>
