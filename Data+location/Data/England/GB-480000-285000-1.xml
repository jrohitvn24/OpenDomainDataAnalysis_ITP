		<content>   Our area is mainly flat but round   
at the edges it gets hilly. The main   
feature is an old abandoned airfield   
in the middle. The area is mainly      
farmland consisting of crops and rough 
grazing land. Most of the agricultural 
area is owned by Rockingham Estates.   
Towards the north-west there are two   
villages, Stoke Albany and Wilbarston. 
In the south-east is the village of    
Pipewell. There are several farms      
dotted around called Wood Farm,        
Woodlands Farm, White Lodge Farm, Home 
Farm, Dob Hall Farm, and Park Farm. The
woods in the area are Bowd Lane Wood,  
Walter Wood, Pipewell Woods, part of   
Stoke Wood, and Askershaw Woods. There 
is a by-pass running past Stoke Albany 
and Wilbarston. This is to stop big    
lorries coming through the villages.   
Near the by-pass is Dallacre Farm      
Estate. There are few roads in our area</content>
