		<title>06INTERVIEW WITH RESIDENT</title>
		<content> The lady I interviewed was Mrs        
 Mackenzie and she had lived in Tarrant
 Launceston for l6 years.Mr Mackenzie  
 works 2 miles away for a firm called  
 Taymix which deals in pig food Mrs    
 Mackenzie has lots of animals around  
 her house,2 ponies,10 bantams,1       
 goose,5 goats and a duck.She showed us
 how she talked to them.She had        
 appeared on the television programe   
 "Thats Life" talking to her           
 animals.She said it was a good job she
 lived in the countryside as she would 
 not be able to have so many animals in
 the town. Mrs Mackenzie goes shopping 
 once a week in Blandford or Wimborne  
 but she misses the village shop as    
 she is always running out of          
 things.She is glad she lives in       
 Tarrant Launceston and she doesnt     
 think she will ever move.
