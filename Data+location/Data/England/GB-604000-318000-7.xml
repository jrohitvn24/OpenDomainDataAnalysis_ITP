		<content> "Bennetts Garden Centre" stands on 1.5
 acres of land. The proprietor, Mr     
 Underwood, took over 2.5 years ago and
 runs this retail garden centre with   
 the help of family, 3 full-time and 2 
 part-time staff. His range of 10,000  
 items includes fruit trees and bushes,
 ornamental trees and shrubs both ever-
 green and deciduous in hundreds of    
 varieties. Also on sale are bedding   
 plants, perennials, bulbs, pot plants,
 and artificial flowers, some of which 
 are made of silk. Other goods range   
 from books on gardening through the   
 necessary tools and equipment up to   
 greenhouses and garden sheds. Bennetts
 trade reflects the surge of interest  
 in gardening and leisure in recent    
 decades as more people become property
 owners, as instanced by the range of  
 conservatories, garden furniture,     
 patio materials and barbeque equipment</content>
