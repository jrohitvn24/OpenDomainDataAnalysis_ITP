		<title>13INDUSTRY IN SABDEN</title>
		<content>{Pendle Furniture}is the biggest single
 industry in the village of{Sabden}.It 
 makes and distributes furniture all   
 over{England}and although there have  
 been many{redundances,Pendle Furniture
 still employs a lot of people.        
     Other Industries in{Sabden include
{printing,cardboard tube manufacture   
{and tool making.Originally Sabden had 
{three cotton mills and people used to 
{travel from outside towns to work in  
{the village.}Nowadays the trend has   
 reversed with most people coming and  
 going out of the village to their     
 employment. The rest of our D-Block is
 mostly a farming district with the    
 exception of small isolated cottage   
 industries like the Trapp Forge.Here  
 we a blacksmith who makes wrought-iron
 gates,horse shoes,fire side furniture 
 and ornamental signs.
