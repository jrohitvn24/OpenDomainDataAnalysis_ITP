		<content>  Twenty eight to ten year old girls   
 and two leaders, Brown Owl and Tawny  
 Owl, gather for two hours weekly to   
 have a Brownie meeting.               
  The aim is to encourage young girls  
 to think of other people and to help  
 the community, and to have fun whilst 
 learning the principles of the Guiding
 Movement started by Lord Baden-Powell 
 many years ago.                       
  A weekly subscription of 25p per     
 Brownie is collected by the leader    
 (sixer) of each small group. These    
 groups are named Pixies, Elves, Imps  
 and Gnomes. A circle is formed whilst 
 singing the Brownie song and group    
 discussion (Pow-wow) follows.         
  Individual pocket books record their 
 progress through the eight challenges.
 (1. Being wide awake  2. Keeping fit  
 3. Doing their best  4. Making things 
 5. Being friendly  6. Lending a hand  </content>
