The Coastliner provides the main bus service as all their buses pass through Tadcaster enroute to their various coastal destinations. Thanks to the provision of free bus travel to pensioners by the Government the service is very well used and it is often difficult to sit down in the bus. There are other smaller buses which provide less frquent transport to local villages. It costs about £5 to go to York on the bus and about £20 in a taxi. To my knowledge, there is no direct service to Selby. There are more cars than ever on the roads and cities like York are quite anti-car and seek to keep private vehicles out of the city centres. This affects town centre traders and encourages out-of-town shopping malls. Cycling both as a sport and means of getting about is popular. There is a good cycle path alongside the dual carriageway to York.   &lt;br />  &lt;br />
