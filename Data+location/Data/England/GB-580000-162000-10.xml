    Our  school  is a  large and modern
 one. It was  rebuilt  about  six years
 ago after a fire destroyed much of the
 original  building. Each  classroom is
 separate and  they  are  positioned in
 pairs. Most  of  the  equipment is new
 and  there are  about  400  juniors in
 thirteen classes.                     
                                       
                                       
     There is a  separate infant school
 just across the school playground. The
 children come to this school when they
 are  seven  and  stay  until  they are
 eleven. At that  age  they move onto a
 number of different secondary schools.
