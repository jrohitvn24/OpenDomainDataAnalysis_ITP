		<title>13Thurlow's sports clubs</title>
		<content> The Thurlow area has a good choice of 
 sports clubs. The bowls team plays in 
 th Steeple Bumstead league, 2 football
 teams play in teh premier and first   
 division of the Halstead league, and  
 the cricket team in a Cambridge area  
 league and in the local Echo Star     
 league. The tennis club was reformed  
 recently with junior and senior       
 sections, a squash club with a        
 slightly declining membership plays at
 Little Thurlow Hall and badminton is  
 played in the village hall. Both pubs 
 have winter darts teams, and the Rose 
 and Crown team won its summer         
 competition. Crib and dominoes are    
 traditionally played in both pubs. The
 village reading room with its billiard
 table has become an unofficial meeting
 place for some village teenagers who  
 may well progress to the Cock's       
 Thursday pool team in years to come.  </content>
