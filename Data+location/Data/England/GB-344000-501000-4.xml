		<content> The Waterford Bridge works of British 
 Industrial Sand seems strangely out of
 place in a rural area such as this.   
 The factory was originally established
 by Cape Insulation Ltd. to process the
 diatomaceous earth dredged from the   
 bed of the former glacial lake 400m.  
 to the north and carried to the       
 factory by overhead cable-way. When   
 the material was dried, the vegetable 
 matter burnt off in a long, slowly    
 revolving cylindrical furnace, and the
 resultant powder mixed with several   
 minerals including asbestos, there is 
 produced a material with a very high  
 insulation factor, ideal for use in   
 power stations for example. However,  
 in the 1970's, asbestos went out of   
 use, the 'earth' could be imported    
 more cheaply than it could be won from
 the local lake, and production ceased.
