		<title>08Offord and Buckden Mill</title>
		<content> It seems that mills have existed on or
 near the site for over a thousand     
 years.Two mills were mentioned in the 
{Domesday Book}of 1086.About a hundred 
 years ago the mill was a busy place.  
 Local farmers took their corn there   
 by cart,waggon or barge and the flour 
 was returned the same way.When the    
 railway came the river became less    
 important for transport and a horse   
 tramway was built to the railway line.
 You can still see the tramway to-day. 
 After many years of business there was
 a slump and the mill was closed in    
 1965.It was then used as a{corn drying
{plant and warehouse}for grain.This    
 also closed four years ago.Now it is  
 used by{agricultural merchants.
