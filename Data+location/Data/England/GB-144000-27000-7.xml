   Newlyn boasts the oldest artist's   
  colony in the country.The first      
 painter's to find their way to Newlyn 
 were Walter Langley and Edwin Harris. 
 They came in 1882 and the Newlyn      
 colony quickly grew.                  
      Possibly the most famous of them 
 all was Stanhope Forbes who arrived   
 early in 1884.Other major artist's    
 beside's Forbes who joined the        
 Newlyn colony were Ralph Lodel,Henry  
 Scott Tuke, Fred Hall T.C. Gatch,     
 Elizibeth Armstrong (who later        
 married Forbes) Norman Garstin Frank  
 Bourdillon and Henry Rheam.           
  These artists shared a set of ideals.
 Most of them were admirers of the     
 French realist painter Bastien Lepage,
 and they followed him in depicting    
 everday scenes of village life and    
 painting where possible on the spot.  </content>
