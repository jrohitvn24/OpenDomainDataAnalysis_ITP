		<title>08SCHOOL BUSES FROM TUNSTALL</title>
		<content> The children of Tunstall have to      
 travel to their schools as there are  
 no education establishments in the    
 village. The juniors receive their    
 primary  education at the modern day  
 school at Catterick Village, the      
 seniors choose to attend the          
 comprehensive school at either        
 Catterick Garrison or at Richmond. The
 children in outlying districts are    
 brought to school by taxi. The North  
 Yorkshire Education Authority pay     
 towards the cost of travelling        
 expenses if the children attend the   
 school nearest to their home. If the  
 parents choose to send their children 
 to a day school further away from home
 then they must pay the bill           
 themselves. The children receive a    
 good all round education with         
 computers being introduced in all     
 schools.                              </content>
