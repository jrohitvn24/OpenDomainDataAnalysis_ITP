		<content> This block 05480381 was done in       
 conjunction with block 05520381 as the
 dividing between them ran down the    
 middle of Station Road.Sutton is      
 situated on England's east coast,3    
 miles south of{Mablethorpe}and 15     
 miles north of{Skegness.Trusthorpe}is 
 1 mile north of Sutton and{Sandilands 
 is 1 mile south.Sutton is a village to
 which a lot of people retire.It is    
 also a holiday resort.It gets very    
 busy around June.We have a permanent  
 populatio of about 1900 but there are 
 lots of houses which are mainly       
 holiday homes.We have one main street 
 of shops.We have a nice beach which is
 covered in sand but sometimes we get  
 stones and pebble washed up on the    
 nice place to live.
