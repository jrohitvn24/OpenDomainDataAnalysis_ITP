		<title>06ADVENTURE IN A HOTHAM GARDEN</title>
		<content>    'Ding dong', I opened the door.    
 "Hello, Jenny, let's go outside"      
 We ran down the steps.  "What shall   
 we play?"  Several games were         
 suggested, but I got bored, ran into  
 our den and down the bank.  The others
 followed close behind, jumped the     
 flower bed, down to the pond, across  
 the lawn and into the orchard.  The   
 others came up puffing and panting and
 we decided to plan an adventure. "Here
 is a big ravine and we've got to swing
 across" I said, "Jenny first, then    
 Chrissie and Bev.  I'll follow last"  
 Igrabbed the swing, then helped Jenny 
 on and she swung across.  She pushed  
 back the swing and we somehow managed 
 to get Chrissie on!  They sent back   
 the swing and Bev. went.  When we were
 all safely across the ravine we ran   
 back up the garden.   I love it here!
