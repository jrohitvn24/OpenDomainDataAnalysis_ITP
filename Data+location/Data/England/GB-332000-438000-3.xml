		<content> Almost 25% of the population of       
 Poulton is retired.This is much higher
 than the national average, and is     
 reflected by the provision made for   
 the elderly in living accommodation   
 and facilities. In the centre of      
 Poulton there is a day centre for old 
 people.There are regular coffee       
 mornings and whist drives,and in the  
 afternoon,teas are provided as well as
 somewhere to talk. Also based in      
 Poulton is a "Meals on Wheels"        
 service, which operates daily. This is
 run by the W.R.V.S.,who run two vans  
 provided by the local "Lions Club".   
 There is a large number of old peoples
 homes-both nursing and rest homes.    
 This seems to be a "growth industry"  
 in the area. One of the largest places
 is Queensway Lodge, near the Day      
 Centre.
