		<content>  There has always been tension between
 farmers and public, especially with   
 regard to conservation and footpaths, 
 but both sides are becoming more aware
 and tolerant of the other's needs.    
 Nevertheless farmlands such as these  
 tend to be very private places. The   
 farmhouses are mainly tucked away, and
 drivers passing through have very     
 few glimpses of the farmer or farmhand
 at work, and little contact with them.
 All farmers questioned were interested
 and helpful. There are no problems    
 from stubble burning and little from  
 vandalism, apart from slight damage   
 from the local hunt or gates left open
 but broiler-house owners fear animal- 
 rights protesters, and gypsies wanting
 land might be a problem.  Bee-keepers 
 report good relations with farmers,   
 who advise them of spraying times so  
 hives can be closed when necessary.   </content>
