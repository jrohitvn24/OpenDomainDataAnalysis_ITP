		<content>     Several sports are played in the  
 village, cricket, bowls,football and a
 peculiarly Sussex game called         
 stoolball. This is a kind of cross    
 between cricket and rounders with     
 a wicket like square, on a stand at   
 head height. A league does exist but  
 it seems to be confined to this patch 
 of Sussex.                            
     A tennis club has been formed     
 recently. The courts having been paid 
 for by the valiant efforts of a band  
 of people who had coffee mornings,    
 jumble sales and play preformances to 
 raise the money.                      
     Football is still the favourite   
 sport for boys and netball for girls  
 while they are in school. Swimming is 
 the next favourite.
