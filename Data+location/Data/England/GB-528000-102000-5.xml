		<title>05PALACE PIER</title>
		<content>  Brighton originally had three piers  
 but one,the Chain Pier was wrecked in 
 a storm in 1896 .You can still see the
 remains of the pier at low tide.The   
 two that are left are the West Pier   
 and the Palace Pier.The West Pier was 
 closed down in 1976 because it was    
 unsafe.millions of pounds are needed  
 to repair it.The only pier left open  
 to the public is the Palace Pier.It   
 was built in     .                    
 There are many different things to do 
 on the pier,including amusements,fair 
 rides etc.There is also an exhibition 
 of antique slot machines which you can
 use if you have any old pennies.      
   It is free to get onto the pier and 
 the deck chairs are also free unlike  
 on the beach where you have to pay.
