		<title>04SCHOOL LIFE IN SANDHURST</title>
		<content>A SMALL VILLAGE SCHOOL                 
 We spoke to 5 fourth year pupils of   
Sandhurst Primary School,Rachel Cobb,  
Victoria Clarke, Cathy Austin, Michael 
Dennis and Christopher Wood.   They    
all live in Sandhurst and travel to    
school by bike, car or on foot. The    
school has 22 pupils: 16 juniors and 6 
infants. The staff consists of the     
Headmistress, 1 half-time teacher, 1   
infant teacher, 2 dinner supervisors   
and 1 cleaner.     School starts at    
9am and finishes at 3pm. They have     
normal lessons and particularly like   
art and reading.   There is a uniform  
but the regulations are not strict.    
The uniform colour is  green. The      
children are very  well organised and  
all age groups play together at break  
and lunchtime. Their favourite game    
seems to be rounders. In class older   
pupils help the younger ones.          </content>
