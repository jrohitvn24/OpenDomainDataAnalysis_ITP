		<title>01A summary of our area.</title>
		<content> Our area is primarily agricultural.   
 There is only one village and that is 
 Shipbourne,which is 4 miles North of  
 Tonbridge,the other houses and farms  
 are widly spread over the area.       
 Most of our area is arable and pasture
 land but there is some woodland.There 
 is pasture in the West because there  
 is lots of clay soil which becomes    
 water-logged so it is not suitable for
 arable crops.The animals that graze   
 are mostly cows and sheep,but there   
 are also horses and donkeys.Because   
 there is good soil around Shipbourne  
 crops like wheat,barley,oats,peas,    
 beans and rape can be grown.The       
 woodland contains coniferous and      
 deciduous trees.                      
 There are 3 establishments for the    
 disabled and handicapped.             
 The area has a poor bus service, most 
 people commute to work by car. Deborah</content>
