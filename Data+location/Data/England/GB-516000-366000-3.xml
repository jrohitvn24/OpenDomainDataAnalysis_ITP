		<content> The busiest times were at 1pm when    
 people were going back to work. It was
 also quite busy from 9.45 to 10.15.   
 There were only 4 buses that passed   
 the school in the 5\ hours,           
 travelling to Lincoln or Horncastle.  
 Most of the tractors went past the    
 school during the last \ hour between 
 2.30 and 3.00.Most of these were      
 leading silage to Mr Barter's Post    
 Office Farm. 10 out of the 101 lorries
 that went past the school came at     
 12.00 to 12.15.                       
 The two horses were being ridden for  
 pleasure.                             
 During the period October to January, 
 the sugar beet factory in Bardney is  
 taking in beet.  At that time of year,
 many more lorries and tractors pass   
 the school.
