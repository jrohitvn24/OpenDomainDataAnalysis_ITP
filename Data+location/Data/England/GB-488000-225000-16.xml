		<content> Across the border in Linslade         
 (Bedfordshire) two estates of houses  
 have been developed since 1965. The   
 larger of these is Southcott village  
 and consists of approximately 1,700   
 individually designed private         
 houses, detached or semi-detached.    
 Also including are four blocks of     
 purpose built flats, catering for     
 single persons and young married      
 couples. This estate is still being   
 developed with planning permission    
 currently being sought for a further  
 500 homes.                            
 On the approach to the urban area of  
 Leighton Buzzard there are 200 small  
 terraced houses built in the late     
 1800's, most of which have been done  
 up with the help of Council grants.   
 There are 50-60 houses owned by       
 Bedfordshire County Council including 
 a block of flats for Senior Citizens. </content>
