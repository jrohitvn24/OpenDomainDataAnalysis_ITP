		<content> The distribution depot is on Stanley  
 Road Industrial Estate.It stores the  
 crisps and then distributes them all  
 over the country and abroad.They are  
 sent to the smallest newsagents and   
 the largest supermarkets.On the staff 
 are 15 office workers and 17 drivers. 
 Though the major part of the business 
 is crisps,they also make snacks such  
 as peanuts.Most of the produce is sold
 under their own label but some is sold
 to the large supermarket chains who   
 use their own names.In recent years   
 the firm has been sponsoring football 
 matches and other events to get       
 advertising for their products.1984   
 has been a successful year for the    
 crisp company,whose annual profit is  
 Â£6,000,000.If advertising was not     
 used, sales would go down by 33%.
