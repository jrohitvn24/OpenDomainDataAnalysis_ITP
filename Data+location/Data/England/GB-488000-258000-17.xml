		<content>THE FIRST MENTION OF BOZEAT CHURCH     
COMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 12th        
CENTURY.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMALL     
NORMAN BUILDING BUILT OF STONE WITH A  
THATCHED ROOF.THE STONE WOULD HAVE BEEN
LOCAL AND THE IRONSTONE FROM NEAR-BY   
WOLLASTON.THERE IS STILL A NORMAN ARCH 
AT THE WEST END OF THE CHURCH TODAY.   
ALTERATIONS WERE MADE IN THE 14th      
CENTURY BY EXTENDING OUTWARDS.A SPIRE  
WAS ADDED DURING THIS TIME AND THE     
DESIGN IS CALLED A "BROACH SPIRE".OAK  
PEWS WERE ADDED IN THE 1500's.THE      
SCREEN DIVIDING THE NAVE FROM THE      
CHANCEL WAS BUILT AT THE SAME TIME.THE 
PRESENT ALTAR WAS PURCHASED IN 1894.   
THE TOWER HAS 5 BELLS THE OLDEST CAST  
IN 1450.THE CHURCH CLOCK DATES FROM AT 
LEAST 1700.THE PARISH CHEST,DATED 1686 
IS BY THE NORTH DOOR(DEVIL'S DOOR).
