		<title>04EDUCATION SCHOOL CONCERT</title>
		<content> On 17th,July 1985 we had a concert for
 the four children who are going on to 
 secondary schools.The children organ- 
 ised the programme themselves.In the  
 first half we sang songs,played our   
 recorders and read some items from    
 our cattle project.After that we per- 
 formed BEANSTALK 1999,which was about 
 the difficulties of keeping a cow in  
 a council flat.We had a pantomime cow,
 Martians,tango dancers,a golden goose,
 a Mayor, a farmer,a narrator and Jack.
 At the end the Rector said a prayer.  
 Parents, friends and School Governors 
 formed the audience.Everybody said    
 they had enjoyed it very much and gave
 us lots of applause.The infants were  
 allowed to take home the Martian head-
 gear they had made.We had a background
 of Jack and the Beanstalk and an      
 enormous giant.
