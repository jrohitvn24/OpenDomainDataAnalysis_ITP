		<title>07HOUSING IN DENTON</title>
		<content> The housing of west{Denton}and{Dane   
{bank}is varied in character. It ranges
 from rows of nineteenth century       
 terraces to modern semi-detached      
 houses. The area has seen great       
 changes resulting from the            
 construction of the{M67}which now cuts
 the town in half. Much old terraced   
 property was demolished leaving a few 
 remnants here and there to remind us  
 of a town and a way of life now gone. 
 The newer semi-detached privately     
 owned houses make up the majority of  
 the areas housing, especially in Dane 
 Bank, although some terraced council  
 rented property is found. The planners
 of the 1930's and 1950's tried hard to
 make a pleasent living environment.   
 Quite tree_lined roads are the norm,  
 Too quite for the younger inhabitants 
 interviewed.For the bulk of the       
  residents, life is comfortable.      </content>
