 The children of West Auckland sing    
 this skipping rhyme :                 
                                       
 Mary Ann Cotton,she's dead and she's  
                                rotten,
 She lies in her grave with her mouth  
                            wide oppen.
 Sing,sing,what shall we sing ?        
 Mary Ann Cotton's hung on a string.   
                                       
  The subject of the rhyme lived on the
 village green and was alleged to have 
 killed 22 relatives including her own 
 children and husbands to obtain insur-
 ance money.She was hanged and buried  
 in Durham Jail in 1873.
