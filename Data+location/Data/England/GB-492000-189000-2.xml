  Waitrose, which covers 1.5 acres,has 
deliveries almost every day,which are  
put on the shelves by the 200 staff and
then sold.On average Waitrose sells    
150,000 items per week,which are       
bought by the 9-10 thousand customers

roams around the shop and stops most   
of the shoplifting.Waitrose has a lot  
of people buying things,some people    
only spend 50p,others will spend up to
