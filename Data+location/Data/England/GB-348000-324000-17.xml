		<title>17Shropshire Observed Outing</title>
		<content> On Sunday July 14th 1985, the         
 Shropshire Natural History and        
 Archaeological Society arranged an    
 excursion to Clive and Grinshill.     
 This was attended by approximately 150
 people who were led around the area in
 groups by local experts in Geology,   
 Botany, Ornithology,Landscape and     
 Mining and Quarrying. Each walk lasted
 approximately an hour and finished at 
 Clive School where the groups changed 
 to another leader and were thus able  
 to enjoy learning about more than one 
 subject. The day's events were        
 organised by Mr. Jeremy Krause, the   
 Head of the Geography Department at   
 Adams School, Wem, as a celebration of
 150 years of observing and collecting 
 of this society in Shropshire and were
 designed to recreate the Victorian    
 spirit of enquiry and interest in the 
 environment.                          </content>
