		<title>01The Blacksmith</title>
		<content> Mr Wilkins works as the blacksmith in 
 Funtington.  The Blacksmith has been  
 on that spot for 300 years. Mr Wilkins
 has been working there for 20 years.  
 Most blacksmiths like their job. It   
 takes 2 hours to shoe a horse. The    
 horse shoe is made from mild steel.   
 Most blacksmiths make anything else if
 necessary. Trade is increasing because
 more people are owning horses. The    
 best nails are from Sweden. The nails 
 are to hold the horse shoe on. A horse
 needs new horse shoes every 6 to 8    
 weeks.  Mr Wilins shoes 20 to 25      
 horses a week.  Blacksmiths           
 put the hot shoe                      
 on the horse foot to see if it fits.  
 Mr Wilkins was trained in the army, it
 took him 6 years to learn. He gets his
 metal from a  steel stockist.
