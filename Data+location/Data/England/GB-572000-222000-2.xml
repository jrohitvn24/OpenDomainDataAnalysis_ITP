		<title>02Braintree Industrial Estate</title>
		<content>    With the rapid expansion of the    
 towns of Braintree, Bocking and Rayne 
 many new businesses have been started.
 Some of these took the benefits of the
 lower rates and enterprise zones      
 allowed by the council during the     
 startup period. Many of these small   
 firms, some only employing a handful  
 of workers are situated on one of the 
 two estates to the west of Braintree. 
    One of these is mainly the small   
 warehouse type business on the        
 Broomhill industrial estate while to  
 the north side of Rayne Road is to be 
 found the Springwood industrial area. 
 This second area is slightly longer   
 established and caters for the larger 
 business premises. Wide roads and easy
 access, coupled to an overnight lorry 
 park, tend to keep the new industrial 
 centre of Braintree thriving.
