 life in the 1980's is giving rise for 
 cncern in two main ways:              
 1a.Increasing congestion within       
 Twyford village boundary by house     
 infill of every available site with a 
 road access.                          
 b. Extension of village houses        
 especially small older houses sold    
 when elderly residents die or leave.  
 c. Congestion caused by vehicles      
 parked on the roads.                  
 2.Break up of family life as follows: 
 a.Break up of marriages.              
 b.Teenagers leaving the family to find
 work.                                 
 c.Extended family split i.e. elderly  
 relatives left when family move to    
 improved employment prospects.
