		<content> Boats and Launching.                  
 The lifeboat station was built in     
 1835.It is 150 years old this year.The
 early lifeboats were wooden and were  
 rowed or sailed out to sea.Today's    
 boat is smaller,lighter and faster.It 
 is an inflatable,inshore type made    
 from rubber and glassfibre.It weighs  
 1.5 tons.It has two outboard motors,  
 each of 60 H.P.A top speed of 35knots 
 and fuel for 100 miles. It is equipped
 with V.H.F.radio,compass,echo sounder,
 First Aid and oars in case both       
 engines fail.   It is launched on a   
 trolley down a slipway. The engines   
 are started even before the shed doors
 are opened.The trolley carries its own
 water supply to cool the engines.  A  
 winch hauls the trolley and boat back 
 up the slipway when it returns.It is  
 then made ready for the next time it  
 will be needed.                       </content>
