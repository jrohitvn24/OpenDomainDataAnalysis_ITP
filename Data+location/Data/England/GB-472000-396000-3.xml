 AN AIR OF CONTENTMENT PERVADES AMONGST
 THE SCATTERED COMMUNITY.   THE        
 PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT, ALMOST TO THE   
 POINT OF ISOLATION, IS THE ATTRACTION.
 THE MAJORITY OF DWELLERS ARE FARMERS, 
 WHO WITH SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS, HAVE 
 CONTINUED TO LIVE AND WORK            
 CONTENTEDLY, DESPITE THE REMOTENESS.  
 ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE A FEW     
 INCOMERS, WHO LHAVE SPECIFICALLY      
 CHOSEN THIS AREA, AS AN ESCAPE FROM   
 THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE URBAN    
 AREAS.   RESERVARTIONS WERE EXPRESSED 
 BU SEVERAL OF THE NON FARMING         
 COMMUNITY REGARDING THE DISAPPEARING  
 HEDGEROWS, REMOVED BY THE FARMERS FOR 
 EASE OF ACCESS TO THE FIELDS.  AS A   
 RESULT  THE TOPE SOIL IS GRADUALLY    
 BEING ERODED AWAY. SPRAYING MAY CAUSE 
 CONTAMINATION OF NATURAL HERBAGE.     </content>
