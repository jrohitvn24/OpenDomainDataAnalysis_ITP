		<title>19Ningwood and Shalfleet Manor</title>
		<content>    The{Manor of Ningwood}was recorded 
 in the Domesday Book and was valued at
 7 pounds.                             
    Liet.Colonel and Mrs.Shapland      
 bought the manor in 1975. The{gardens 
 are open to the public from time to   
 time. In planning the garden great    
 attention has been given to{colour.  }
 There is a lot of{yellow}at the front 
 of the house.At the back there is a   
 garden of{white}flowering plants.     
   {Shalfleet Manor}is right in the    
 village. The name is Saxon and refers 
 to the shallow creek. At one time the 
 nearness of the village to the Newtown
 River and harbour made it a busy      
 place.                                
    The manor is a very pretty one and 
 is set among pleasant gardens.There is
 a glimpse of the{rose walk}and the    
{lavender hedges}from the road. There  
 is a swimming pool at the back.       </content>
