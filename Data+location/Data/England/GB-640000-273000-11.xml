		<title>11Families - Louise</title>
		<content>I have a brother called Thomas. My name
is Louise Desborough and I am six years
old. I live at Church Farm, Wenhaston  
and my Dad is the farmer. We grow sugar
beet, barley, corn, mangles and oats.  
We have lots of cows that we sell for  
beef. My Grandad was also the farmer   
before my Dad. Lots of my family live  
in Wenhaston.                          
I go to the primary school and I like  
maths, reading and English. I use the  
computer for all of these. The book I  
like best is Wind in the Willows.      
My favourite food is steak with chips  
and gravy. I also like fish, but I     
don't like swede or cabbage or beans,  
but Mum makes me eat them. We have a   
silver Ford car and an orange Datsun   
Patrol. My best friend is Carla - she  
is some sort of cousin.
