		<title>04THE VICAR</title>
		<content> Mr Byron is a vicar who preaches at St
 Mary's and St Cyriac's churches,      
 Swaffham Prior every Sunday. He has   
 been a vicar for 35 years and at the  
 churches since September 1974. There  
 have been 30 vicars at the two        
 churches in the past. Mr Byron is     
 involved in a lot of activities in the
 village. Every Thursday he joins the  
 Community school to help in classroom 
 activities and to take assembly. He   
 has lots of interesting clothes that  
 he wears for different services. He   
 has 10 people in the choir, 3 of them 
 are in our class. There are normally  
 about 25 people who go to Family      
 Service and about 16 who go to the    
 other services. The lowest number that
 can ever be remembered was 12 and that
 was on a very cold day.
