		<content>      A local old folks home.          
 Many local elderly people live        
 here.They are very happy there and    
 seem to be well cared for.There is a  
 long waiting list.To get in when you  
 are 80 years old you must have had    
 your name on the list for 20 years!In 
 the bedrooms everything is run by     
 battery because the old people forget 
 to switch things off.The rooms are    
 ready furnished,but the old people can
 take as many of their own small       
 posessions as they want.There are 3   
 T.V. rooms,one for each channel,a     
 library and beautiful grounds.The old 
 people can persue many hobbies such as
 sewing and handicrafts.They have many 
 outings and the chapel is available to
 people of all religions.What a super  
 place to spends the last days of your 
 life.                                 
                                       </content>
