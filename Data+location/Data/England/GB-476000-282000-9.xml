		<title>09School Sports Day</title>
		<content>At Braybrooke County Primary School we 
have 2 sports days.We have one of our  
own and a big one in which 4 schools   
take part.This is my first sports day  
in this school. Before our own sports  
day the weather was terrible and I had 
a funny feeling it was going to rain on
the day. When the day arrived it was a 
little windy in the morning but very   
warm in the afternoon so we were lucky.
I think the infants 3-legged races are 
the funniest because when one of the   
pairs are in the lead they just fall   
over so if someone else is lucky they  
win. On the 3rd July 1985 3 more       
schools came to join us.The schools    
were Loddington, Maidwell and Rushton. 
We were'nt doing very well at the start
but in the end we won. It was a very   
enjoyable day.
