		<title>18WESTHOUGHTON TODAY</title>
		<content> In Westhoughton today there are lots  
 of things to do but not many special  
 places to visit.                      
    There are many shops and some of   
 these belong to a {chain}like         
 Greenhalghs,Waterfields,and Diamond   
 Discount.This means that the chain has
 other shops in nearby towns.          
    Some of the shops are{family-owned}
 like Tinniswoods,Mark Brown's,and Sam 
 Aldred's.These shops were set up by   
 one generation of the family and have 
 been taken on by the son or daughter. 
 They will probably be continued by a  
 child of the present owner.           
    There are a few{restaurants},such  
 as Casa Nostra,The Courtyard,and The  
 Mercury Motel.There are many{public   
{houses}(pubs),such as The Loose Goose,
 The Red Lion,The Wheatsheaf,The White 
 Lion,The Greyhound,The Waggon and     
 Horses,The Rose and Crown.            </content>
