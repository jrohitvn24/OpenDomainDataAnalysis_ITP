		<title>02Cannock Chase in history.</title>
		<content>    It all started with King William   
because the present day Cannock Chase  
is part of what was once a vast hunting
area created by William the Conqueror  
and known as the King's Forest of      
Cannock.                               
    For several centuries the land     
was used for hunting, but then the     
woodlands were cleared for charcoal    
burning.                               
    During the first world war, the    
heathland was covered by military      
camps, but by 1920, the Forestry       
Commission had taken over large areas  
to establish Cannock Forest.           
    In 1957, Staffordshire County      
Council acquired a large area of open  
heathland and created Cannock Chase    
Country Park.                          
    Our survey block contains areas of 
both the forest and the heathland.
