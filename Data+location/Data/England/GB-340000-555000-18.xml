		<content> The{James Street}studio comprises 3   
 artists, 3 photographic retouchers,   
 and 2 camera operators who also do    
 design work (5 litre cans &amp; 20/25     
 litre drums) for MB Mansfield and Liv-
 erpool. Flat artwork must take account
 of the lines along which the tin will 
 be stamped and folded. A negative for{
{each colour}is produced by photograph-
 ing the artwork through a fine screen 
 of dots. Each negative is transferred 
 to a sensitive metal plate which,     
 mounted on the roller of the printing 
 machine, prints{one colour}onto the   
 plain tin sheets. These are dried in  
 ovens and overprinted with the next   
 colour until the design is complete.  
 The{varnished}sheets are cut into     
 strips for stamping out lids and fold-
 ing bodies. The production machines   
 can be retooled to make all sizes and 
 shapes of tins. {Continued on p.19>> }</content>
