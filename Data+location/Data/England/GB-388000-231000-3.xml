		<content>  The carnival is an annual event.It is
 a procession through the town and     
 every year there is a different       
 subject or theme that you have to     
 dress up to.There are two catagories  
 of entry;walking or by float.People   
 decorate the floats with paper        
 flowers,sheets and scenery.The floats 
 go in the council offices and the     
 pedestrians go into the Vineyards to  
 be judged.There are usually four or   
 five judges.The Round Table organizes 
 the whole carnival including the fete 
 afterwards.A few selected marching    
 bands are included as every           
 participant processes through the main
 street of the town.
