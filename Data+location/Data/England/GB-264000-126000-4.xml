		<content> Castle Hill has been lived in by many 
 generations of the Fortescue family.  
 In 1719 Hugh Fortescue succeeded his  
 father.  He did not think the dwelling
 of his ancestors was suitable so he   
 built a house named Castle Hill       
 Mansion.  William Kent was employed to
 change the landscape around Castle    
 Hill.  Looking from the temple on the 
 top of Castle Hill there is a very    
 good view over Bideford Bay.  Coming  
 down the hill to the stream there is  
 Sybils Cave. The house was built near 
 three streams.  One was part of the   
 River Bray and the others were running
 from east to west, and north to south.
 The biggest is the River Bray with    
 brown trout and at one time salmon.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
