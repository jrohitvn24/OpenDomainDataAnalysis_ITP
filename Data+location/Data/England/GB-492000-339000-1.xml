		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The main physical features of this    
 area are a scarp and dip slope which  
 runs north-south along the eastern    
 boundary and the river Witham which   
 meanders north-east linking the three 
 villages situated within this area.   
 The villages of Belton,Syston and     
 Barkston origonally straddled the A607
 as it ran north from Grantham.However 
 the introduction of bypasses has      
 effectively isolated Belton and       
 Syston.                               
 The National Trust operates Belton    
 House,formally owned by the Brownlow  
 and Cust families.                    
 About 3/4 mile north of Belton lies   
 Syston.Syston Old Hall is positioned  
 centrally and is the home of the      
 Thorold family.                       
 Barkston is situated a further half   
 mile north.The village contains a     
 primary school,post office and garage.</content>
