		<content> The villages of{Great and Little}     
 Walsingham founded in Anglo_Saxon     
 times lie in the valley of the little{
{River Stiffkey}.The well_wooded arable
 land is gently undulating all below   
 seventy metres above sea_level.       
 Gt. Walsingham,by far the larger in   
 acreage,only equals Lt.Walsingham in  
 population.The older flint_built      
 houses nestle around a village        
 green.On three occasions it has       
 received the{Best_Kept Village}       
 award.The main employment is          
 agricultural although it does possess 
 a small iron foundry.                 
 Lt.Walsingham until the dissolution   
 of the Monasteries was second only to 
 Canterbury as a place of              
 pilgrimages.Since the 1930's both main
 religions have worked to restore it to
 its former importance and glory.
