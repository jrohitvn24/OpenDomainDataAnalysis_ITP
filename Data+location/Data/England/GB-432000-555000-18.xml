		<title>18SHOPS AND SHOPPING</title>
		<content> If I want to go shopping for clothes I
 usually go into Sunderland which is   
 the nearest town to Pennywell. There  
 are no large department stores,       
 furniture stores or boutiques in      
 Pennywell. We go by bus or car.       
 Opposite our house there are 4 small  
 shops-fruiterer, baker &amp; confectioner,
 grocery and one vacant which used to  
 be a butcher's. There are other       
 streets with small shops near us but  
 they are similar to those I've        
 described and do not carry a very big 
 range of goods. We do our weekly shop 
 at one of the big stores in Sunderland
 or Washington. There is quite a rapid 
 change over in the small shops        
 probably because high unemployment in 
 the area keeps spending down. Many of 
 the shops have their windows boarded  
 up against burglary and vandalism.
