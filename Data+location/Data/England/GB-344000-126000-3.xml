		<title>03Fund raising in Pitney</title>
		<content> Pitney has a lovely church and next to
 this is the village hall which used to
 be the school up to 20 years ago.The  
 hall is now used by the{Sunday        
{School,Youth Club,Womens' Institute   
 and for private functions.Every August
 the{Flower Show}is held,the{Harvest   
{Supper}in October,the{village Play}is 
 March and every 2 months a dance is   
 held.These are very successful and are
 supported not just by village people  
 but by friends and relations from     
 other villages.In August we have a {  
{Barbeque}where a pig is roasted on a  
 spit.This event attracts  a large     
 number of people.Two years ago the    
 Youth Club did a sponsored swim to    
 raise funds for the village hall's new
 extension_they collected Â£110.In March
 1985 the Sunday School children did a 
 sponsored 10 mile walk and raised Â£250
 towards a new church organ.           </content>
