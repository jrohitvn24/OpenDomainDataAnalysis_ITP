		<title>20THE MARKET HALL, WIGAN</title>
		<content>{ Wigan Market Hall}is one the last    
 parts of{'Victorian Wigan'}still in   
 regular use. The late 19th century    
 covered hall houses over 100 separate 
 stalls and is the scene of hectic     
 activity six days a week. However, as 
 with many old buildings it is in need 
 of urgent repairs. The local council  
 has decided that it would be more     
 economical to{demolish}it and{replace 
 it with a modern version.             
  Many people have written to the local
 paper (The Wigan Observer) complaining
 about this decision saying that the   
 money would be better spent on the    
 restoration of the original site.     
  This question was posed to 100 people
{  "Is a new market hall necessary?"   
 and the results were:-                
     YES      NO        DON'T KNOW     
     28%      46%           26%        
 showing that a new hall is not needed.</content>
