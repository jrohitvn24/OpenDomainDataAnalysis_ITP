		<content>{Chesterfield Canal:                   
 The Chesterfield Canal was surveyed by
 the famous James Brindley in 1769 but 
 he had died before it was completed in
 1777.It was originally 46 miles long  
 and joined Chesterfield to West       
 Stockwith (with outlet therefore to   
 the River Trent and the Sea) and      
 provided an outlet for such goods as  
 coal,iron,stone,corn,lime,timber,     
 pottery and ale.                      
 It declined with the advent of        
 railways, hastened by a tunnel        
 collapse in the one and a half mile   
 long Norwood tunnel in 1908 but trade 
 managed to hang on until 1955.Still   
 visible on some bridge uprights are   
 marks scored by the ropes of horse    
 drawn barges.                         
 Today it is navigable for 26miles and 
 is most attractive for much of its    
 length:uses_ fishing,cruising,walking.</content>
