		<title>10IMPERIAL HOTEL, EXMOUTH</title>
		<content> I think that the hotel looks good     
 because of its white walls, lovely    
 garden, swimming pool and 2 tennis    
 courts. The Imperial hotel has 58     
 rooms, some single, some double and   
 some family. It was built in (1865)   
 and most of it was rebuilt in (1972)  
 when a fire broke out. Added          
 attractions are a sauna, solarium, 18 
 hole putting green, childrens         
 adventure park and a croquet lawn.    
 There is provision for the disabled.  
 Mr Rogers the manager said that he did
 like his job. He looks after his      
 customers,checks that the hotel is    
 clean and tidy. There are 20-30 staff 
 in the winter and 40-50 in the summer.
 Mr Rogers works 12-15 hours a day in  
 the summer. It is busiest from Easter 
 until October.
