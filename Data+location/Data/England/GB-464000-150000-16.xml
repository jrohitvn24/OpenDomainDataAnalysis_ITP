		<title>16Basing House - History</title>
		<content>  When the{Civil War}started in 1643   
 Basing House was in a good strategic  
 place on the road leading to the      
 west, as Basingstoke does today.      
  Basing House was then owned by the   
{King's loyal friend,John Paulet,      
{Marquis of Winchester,}but it was in a
{parliamentary area}with the nearest   
{Royal base}at Oxford.                 
  The{seige}started in July 1643 and   
 finished in October 1645, 6 days after
{Cromwell}arrived at the house.        
  When the{parliament army}searched the
 house they found John Paulet hiding in
 an{oven.                              
  The Paulets still own the house and  
 the present owner searched the house  
 and grounds thoroughly to find the    
 legendary{golden calf.}He failed and  
 hardly ever visits the house now.
