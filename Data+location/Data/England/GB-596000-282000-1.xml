		<title>01A FOREST AREA</title>
		<content> This area lies in South Norfolk.It is 
 mostly coveredeuth pine forest,       
 fringed                               
 to the South and East by fields of    
 arable crops.  Although it is sparsley
 populated, it is encircled by villages
 of varying sizes, and the town of     
 Thetford is only a few miles away.  It
 is supportive of many species of      
 wildlife, and wild flowers grow in    
  abundance.  Access to this area is   
 made easy by its proximity to the     
 South and West of a major roadway,    
 linking up with roads and tracks      
 which, in turn, connect with larger   
 roads to the North and East.
