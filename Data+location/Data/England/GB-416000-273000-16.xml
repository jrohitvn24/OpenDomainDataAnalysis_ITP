		<content>   Further housing development in the  
 area is causing concern among existing
 residents over the erosion of green   
 belt land.A proposed new development  
 of 750 houses on land adjoining       
 residential areas has provoked        
 petitions and objections from locals  
 that too many houses are scheduled to 
 be built.                             
  Resident association meetings have   
 been held and action groups formed to 
 combat the building.The most recent   
 development is that the Local planning
 authority have agreed in principle to 
 limit the number of dwellings to 500. 
  Action is to be continued to further 
 object and attempt to prevent any     
 further building at all.
