		<title>09DRAYTON'S DAIRY</title>
		<content> Winfrith Newburgh is a very large     
 parish consisting mainly dairy and    
 arable farming.In the Domesday Book   
 there was land for 24 ploughs.The     
 manor and lands of Winfrith were given
 to Robert Newburgh by Henry 1 so the  
 village became Winfrith Newburgh.It   
 stayed with this family until the     
 early 17th.Century when it was sold to
 Humphrey Weld.The land has stayed with
 this family ever since.In 1768 the Act
 of Enclosure changed when Common land 
 was enclosed.Before this some farmers 
 changed their strips of land with each
 other and gathered them together in   
 'Lots'.One farmer Abraham Drayton did 
 this over 240 years ago and we went to
 visit it.Drayton's Dairy is next door 
 to our school.Mr.Hastings the manager 
 showed us round.First we went to look 
 at the prize cows,they were getting   
 ready for the'Royal Agricultural Show'</content>
