 sports do people play regularly.      
 Swimming was top of the list by far.  
 Badminton ,football,squash,snooker and
 athletics were also very popular.     
 Sailing, rugby ,tennis,golf and       
 cricket were quite popular.55% of the 
 households had club or team members   
 living in them.Many people travel out 
 of the area to take part in their     
 sport.They go to Frodsham,Runcorn,    
 Chester,Helsby,Wrexham, Abersoch, Bala
 or even Leeds.The most popular        
 spectator sports are football,rugby   
 and tennis but snooker,cricket and    
 athletics are also popular.           
   In our block the only sports        
 facility is for the cricket club and  
 they play at Ashton Hayes.Soon there  
 will be a badminton court in the      
 Comunity Centre.
