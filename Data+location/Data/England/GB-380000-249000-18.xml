		<title>18My home in CallowEnd. Delia.</title>
		<content> I live on a smallholding near Callow  
 End. It has no electricity and no     
 running water. We have parafin lamps  
 and a calor gas cooker. We also have a
 rayburn and an open fire. We have open
 fires upstairs which you put glowing  
 coals in to heat up the room.         
 In the pantry,we pump water which goes
 up into the roof to come back down    
 again. We also have a slab to keep    
 things cool.                          
 Outside,we hand_milk the goats and    
 cows. Sometimes we make butter from   
 the cream. We also keep bees; we      
 extract their honey and sell it.      
 We have recently had a bathroom put   
 in; before that we used to have an old
 tin bath.
