		<title>09ANIMAL REARING NEAR SEISDON</title>
		<content>   So far as animal husbandry is       
concerned most farmers seem to keep    
some  stock.   Traditionally this has  
been a dairy cattle area, but with the 
necessity of cutting down milk quotas  
under E.E.C. farming regulations there 
has been a swing to the fattening of   
beef cattle, though some farmers still 
keep one or two dairy cows.            
   Pastureland mostly provides good    
grazing for cattle and though there are
a few poorer areas these are quite     
small and restricted, usually on badly-
drained or hilly ground.               
   A few large flocks of sheep are to  
be seen, but this is not really a      
sheep-farming area.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
