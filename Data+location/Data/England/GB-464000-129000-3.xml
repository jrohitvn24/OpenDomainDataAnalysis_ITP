		<title>03A new Ropley family</title>
		<content> We moved into Ropley a year ago from  
 the North London suburb of South      
 Ruislip.Dad's job had moved him to    
 Hampshire and we wanted to live in the
 country rather then in a town.The move
 to Ropley meant that we could have a  
 big house that wasn't exactly the same
 as all the other houses because       
 although people here think that houses
 are expensive in Ropley they aren't   
 compared to London.We thought the     
 house we found was just right because 
 it is just opposite the school and    
 near the church and the village shop. 
 Mum hasn't got a car so the village   
 shop keeps us in food until Saturdays 
 when we go and do our main shopping.  
 There are also clubs and societies    
 that interested all the family. I     
 really like living here,I quickly made
 lots of friends,and so did the rest of
 the family.                           </content>
