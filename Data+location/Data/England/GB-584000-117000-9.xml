		<content> The parish is now part of the United  
 Benefice of St. Mary, Udimore with    
 St. George, Brede, so services at both
 churches work in conjunction with each
 other.  Normally, at Udimore there is 
 a Eucharist at 8.00 am each Sunday,   
 and Evensong on most Sundays; once a  
 month there is a Sung Eucharist and   
 on special occasions there is         
 Mattins.thealternative Service Book   
 Rite B is used for theeucharist, but  
 the Book of Common Prayer is used for 
 Evensong.  At most services there are 
 about 20 people, most of whom are     
 elderly or retired.  At Udimore there 
 are few young families so there is no 
 Sunday School.  Many of the Church    
 activities are also village           
 activities and reflect the passing    
 seasons. The church is seriously cared
 for by the small population.
