		<title>02CUSTOMS (FROYLE/HOLYBOURNE)</title>
		<content> There have been inhabitants at Froyle 
 for 50,000 years,{the name Froyle is  
{derived from the pagan goddess of     
{corn, Freya}and no doubt many pagan   
 customs were observed in the far past.
 More recent local customs have died   
 out as people now go into Alton or    
 Farnham for entertainment at holiday  
 times but for many years the Froyle   
 School children have taken part in    
 Country dancing and have danced round 
 their{Maypole on May Day}and at the   
 village fete. {Foxhounds still hunt   
{the area occasionally.
