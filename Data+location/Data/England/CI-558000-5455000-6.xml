		<title>06Tourism at Greve de Lecq</title>
		<content>   The people that we interviewed at   
 Greve de Lecq thought the beach was   
 sheltered and in a nice spot. All the 
 tourists got there by car. None of the
 tourists we interviewed had been for a
 swim and it was mid June; it hasn't   
 been a  nice summer so that's probably
 why.                                  
 There was a kiosk owner on a slipway  
 and he hired out his deck chairs at   
 40p for a day and 30p for a half day. 
 He worked from 9am to 6pm. He was also
 a part time farmer and was worried    
 about the possible infestation        
 of colorado beetles (a potato         
 pest in Europe but not in Jersey) that
 could happen if beetles blown from    
 France took a hold. A pound of        
 potatoes are 9p at the moment and show
 that the potato season is well        
 advanced.  Prices are much higher     
 earlier on at the end of May.         </content>
