		<content> INHERITANCE WAS THE SOLE FACTOR IN THE
 TRANSFER OF HORSFORD MANOR FROM THE   
 TIME OF THE CONQUEROR UNTIL IT WAS    
 SOLD BY SIR RICHARD BARRETT LENNARD IN
 1974. THE NAME PROBABLY COMES FROM    
 THE POSITION AT THE LEAST MARSHY      
 CROSSING PLACE OF THE RIVER HOR. THE  
 FLAGCUTTERS PUB, DATED 1847 REFERS TO 
 THE LOCAL CUSTOM OF CUTTING PEAT FOR  
 FUEL FROM THE SURROUNDING HEATH. UNTIL
 THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY WEAVING WAS    
 CARRIED ON IN THE VILLAGE HOMES, AN   
 OFFSHOOT OF THE NORWICH CLOTH TRADE. A
 TOWER WINDMILL, NOW DERELICT, THE     
 COACHBUILDERS WORKSHOP, THE SMITHY AND
 THREE PUBS SHOW THIS WAS ONCE A SELF  
 CONTAINED VILLAGE RATHER THAN A       
 COMMUTER DORMITORY FOR NORWICH. CHURCH
 FARM, FELTHORPE IS NOTEABLE FOR BEING 
 THE CHILDHOOD HOME OF ANNA SEWELL'S   
 MOTHER.A SMALL ZOO WAS KEPT BY MR.    
 ANNERSON IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY.   </content>
