		<content> It was a lovely LANDSCAPE you could   
 see for miles.It was a fantastic      
 view.The hedges were really           
 overgrown.On the west side there was a
 SCARP SLOPE.This was mainly made of   
 grit and surrounded by trees.The      
 vegetation beneath the SCARPE SLOPE   
 was lush.The SCARP SLOPE and the      
 vegetation were the main GEOLOGICAL   
 features of Congleton Edge.The east   
 side sloped into farmland which       
 contained rough grazing for the       
 cattle.DAIRY FARMING dominated the    
 LANDSCAPE.When you looked to the west 
 you could see a couple of goats.The   
 ground was very soft,although there   
 were many stones embedded in the      
 paths.The walk was about a mile long  
 there and back.It took us half an hour
 at a steady speed.It was very quiet   
 and lonely up there.
