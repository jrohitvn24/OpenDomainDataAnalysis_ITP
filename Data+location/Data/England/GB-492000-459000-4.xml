		<title>04Wetwang,Living on a farm.</title>
		<content> Living on a farm out side the village 
 is quiet isolated especially in       
 winter.Also it is hard to get out     
 to the shops so we have to stock up   
 with  food in case we get snowed      
 in.It's always busy on a farm         
 especially in harvest when there are  
 lots of tractors about the farm.Living
 on a farm has it's advantages because 
 you can keep more pets on a farm      
 because there is more room but it also
 has it's disadvantages because you    
 have to travel a long way to the      
 nearest village.I don't think I could 
 ever live in a village or town because
 of the traffic and the noise . It's   
 not that noisy on a farm. I like      
 living on a farm because it's fairly  
 quiet and there is lot's of room to go
 for a walk,ride my bike,make a den in 
 the straw stack and take my dog for a 
 walk.                                 </content>
