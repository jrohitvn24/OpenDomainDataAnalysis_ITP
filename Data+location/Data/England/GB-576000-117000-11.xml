		<title>11Recreation in Sedlescombe</title>
		<content> In the 1970's all the Sports Clubs in 
 the village were amalgamated under the
 title 'The Sedlescombe Sports         
 Association'.They then acquired a     
 sports field known as the Pestalozzi  
 Field at the southern end of the      
 village and erected a pavilion which  
 is well used by the associate clubs,  
 viz., the Football, Stoolball, Cricket
 and Junior Football Clubs. The Tennis 
 Club has courts which can be hired by 
 the public, and a pavilion. The School
 has a small swimming pool which can be
 hired by local clubs. There are two   
 children's playgrounds, one near the  
 tennis courts and one near a housing  
 development. Many people are keen     
 gardeners. There are fishing          
 facilities at Powdermill Reservoir and
 game shooting on Hurst Estate. Small  
 farms organise clay pigeon shoots.
