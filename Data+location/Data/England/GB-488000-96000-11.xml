		<title>11CHILDREN'S GAMES (1 of 2)</title>
		<content> The games we play at home include     
 cricket, soccer, netball and tennis.  
                                       
 Here are some other games:-           
                                       
 In {Kick-the-Can}you play with a can  
 and a person has to find the ones who 
 have hidden, after he has counted to  
 forty.  When he finds a person he runs
 to kick the can and says that person's
 name.    The first person caught is   
 'it' and the game starts again when   
 everybody has been caught.            
                                       
 In{Wall Ball}two people play the game.
 You have to kick the ball against a   
 wall.  When the ball rebounds the     
 other person has to kick it first     
 time.  If you don't manage to do that,
 the other person has won.
