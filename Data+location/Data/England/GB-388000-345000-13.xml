		<title>13FENTON PARK AND CEMETERY</title>
		<content>In 1916 Fenton Park was created.At the 
entrance there are green gates and a   
welcome sign.It is a nice environment  
there is not a lot of noise,only a few 
sounds of traffic.You see and hear a   
lot of birds.There is a rockery with   
limestone boulders set into the ground 
and it has a lovely spread of flowers  
coloured purple,white,yellow,orange,   
green,blue,red and maroon.             
There is a drinking fountain in the    
park,which was brought from Fountain   
Square in Fenton and was a bequest to  
the people,from one"William Baker Esq".
Fenton Cemetery built in 1887,was one  
of the last ones to be made in the     
city.The two chapels in the grounds are
being restored at present.There is a   
Moslem section in the cemetery and     
their gravestones face in an Easterly  
direction towards the holy city of     
Mecca.The cemetery is a peaceful place.</content>
