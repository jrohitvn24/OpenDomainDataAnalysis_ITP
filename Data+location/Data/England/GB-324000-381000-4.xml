		<title>04FARMING AROUND PENSBY</title>
		<content>      Around the outskirts of Pensby   
 there are many fields.To the West of  
 Pensby is mainly arable land and to   
 the East is pasture land which is used
 for dairy and beef cattle.            
     Arable land is to the west and    
 vegetable crops such as lettuce,      
 cabbage, potatoes, and spinage,       
 as well as barley, are grown because  
 the soil is sandy. Many machines such 
 as the plough, seed sower, roller and 
 irrigator are used. The produce goes  
 to market in Liverpool.               
     To the east the soil is a moist   
 clay which is ideal for juicy grass   
 for pasture land. Some of the grass is
 used for sileage. This is kept in a   
 sileage pit and the cows eat it in the
 winter. After milking a tanker takes  
 the milk to Swan Hill dairy. The farms
 keep cows, hens, sheep and dogs. They 
 do not have much machinary.           </content>
