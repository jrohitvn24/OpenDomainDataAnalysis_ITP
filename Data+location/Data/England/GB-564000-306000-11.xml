		<title>11Shouldham-Where we live.</title>
		<content>  There has been a lot of building n   
 Shouldham,mostly bungalows,and quite a
 lot of refurbishing of places like the
 Old Butcher's shop,public houses,     
 Bakery and Blacksmith's.              
  In Shouldham Thorpe new building has 
 been less,most families living in     
 cottages which once belonged to Hall  
 Farm.                                 
  Most families have installed central 
 heating but retain the open fire,     
 there being no gas in the villages,but
 a ready supply of wood for stoves.    
  Some of our homes have now fitted    
 double glazing as an energy saver but 
 also to lessen the noise of aircraft  
 from Marham.Kitchens have changed     
 with the advent of automatic washing  
 machines, microwave cookers and       
 automatic dish washers. Many of our   
 homes now have colour television and  
 video recorders.                      </content>
