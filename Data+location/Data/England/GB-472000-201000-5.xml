		<content>   Every Easter there is an Easter     
 Parade organised by St Andrew's       
 School when a procession of children, 
 adults and decorated floats passes    
 through the village streets. 'Egg     
 Jarping' used to take occur but has   
 ceased. Easter Egg and Bonnet         
 competions take place; these are held 
 at Mill Lane School. At the latter    
 school on May Day, maypole dancing    
 takes place, two kings and queens are 
 crowned and traditional dances are    
 performed by the children.            
   Sydenham Fayre, originally held to  
 celebrate Harvest, was recommenced    
 five years ago. There are displays of 
 rural arts and crafts as well as the  
 usual stalls. Proceeds go to various  
 charities.                            
   Harvest Festivals are held at all   
 churches and in both schools.         
 Christian Aid is also an annual event.</content>
