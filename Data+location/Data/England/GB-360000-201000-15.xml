		<content>    Many people in 1985 set great store
 on possessing pieces of hardware which
 they regard as essential to modern    
 life so we did a count over 108 homes 
 to see who has what.                  
 96% had colour T.V., 75% had an       
 automatic washing machine, 24% owned a
 microwave oven, 53% of homes had a    
 video recorder, only 3 families(2.7%) 
 had a video camera, 74% owned at least
 one car, 69% had a telephone, deep    
 freezers were in 84% of homes, just 4 
 homes(3.7%) contained a dishwasher,   
 59% had an automatic toaster and 50%  
 had a toasted sandwich maker. Although
 home computers are relatively new 38% 
 already have one but they are used    
 mainly for playing games. We found out
 that 73% of these computers had been  
 bought during the last year.          
    We wonder what people will have in 
 the year 2085?                        </content>
