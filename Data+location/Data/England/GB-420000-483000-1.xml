		<content> This is a particularly peaceful,green,
 undulating, area, generously endowed  
 with a variety of trees, both         
 coniferous and deciduous.It is        
 sprinkled with mainly stone houses,   
 many of great age and mostly connected
 with farming, with which the region is
 associated.                           
                                       
 The {River Ure}enters from the north-{
 west and meanders its steeply-banked  
 way in a south-easterly direction,    
 cutting the land in two separate      
 parts.                                
                                       
 To the east lie the villages of       
{Thornton Watlass, Thirn,}and{Clifton- 
{on-Ure},in descending order of size.  
 To the west is the hamlet of{Low      
{Ellington.}There is no bridging       
 point between.                        
                                       </content>
