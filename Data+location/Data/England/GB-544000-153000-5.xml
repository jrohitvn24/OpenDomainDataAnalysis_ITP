		<title>05THE WESTERHAM FLYER</title>
		<content> For a number of years a railway ran   
 from Westerham to Dunton Green. It was
 affectionately known as "The Westerham
 Flyer".The train called at Brasted,   
 Chevening Halt and Dunton Green where 
 passengers could catch trains to      
 London. It was hoped at one time that 
 the line would be extended to Oxted   
 but this did not happen. The line     
 would have gone along what is now     
 South Bank. The line gradually became 
 less well used as more people became  
 car owners.                           
 Sir Winston Churchill used the line   
 regularly when he came to Chartwell.  
 The line closed about the time of his 
 death.                                
 All that remains today is a road which
 runs alongside the old line and is    
 known as The Flyers Way.
