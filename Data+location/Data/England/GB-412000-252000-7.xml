		<title>07FARMING YEAR IN GRAFTON</title>
		<content> In the Spring we do quite alot of     
 spraying to kill weeds and in the late
 Spring we cut the grass for silage    
 that is cut and directly collected up 
 and put in the silage pit. In early   
 Summer we collect the hay which is    
 grass, cut and left to dry before     
 gathering. In the Summer we harvest   
 the wheat and barley and take the     
 grain in trailers to be emptied into  
 sheds. It is then taken to be ground  
 into powder for animal feed. In the   
 Winter we bring in the cattle and put 
 them in sheds to eat food like oats,  
 hay and straw, or the cows may stay in
 a yard. During the year most of the   
 cows have calves which we keep if they
 are cows but if they are bulls we sell
 them at the market in Stratford.
