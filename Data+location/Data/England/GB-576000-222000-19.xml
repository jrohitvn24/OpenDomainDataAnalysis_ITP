		<title>19INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Industry in Braintree has suffered    
 during recent years with Courtauld's  
 Textile Mill closing in 1980.This     
 meant a loss of many jobs and future  
 employment prospects.                 
 The main industrial development is    
 situated around East Street and sur-  
 rounding roads.Crittall Windows and   
 Lake and Elliots are the larger firms 
 both being involved in metal          
 manufacturing.Nearby Charrington Coal 
 Offices and yard occupy a sizeable    
 piece of land off Railway Street.     
 Charrington have been in Braintree for
 over a 100 years but in recent years  
 have seen a reduction in buisness.    
 The rest of the Industrial estate is  
 of a varied nature with light         
 industrial units and small            
 manufacturing firm.
