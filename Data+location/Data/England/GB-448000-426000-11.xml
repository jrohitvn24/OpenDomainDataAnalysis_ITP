		<title>11BURTON SALMON SCHOOL LIFE 1</title>
		<content>   I live at 7 Foxcliffe Brotherton. I 
 wake up at 6.30 because my Mum goes to
 work at 7.25. Every morning I have    
 cornflakes for my breakfast. I set off
 for school at 8.15 and arrive about   
 8.25. I go to the village shop and    
 usually buy ice-pops.                 
   At 8.55 I go into the classroom and 
 get on with some 9 a day work,it is   
 like maths but it is easy. At about   
 9.30 we get on with Beta Maths. I am  
 on Beta Book 4.                       
   When I come home from school I go to
 the shop and when I get home from the 
 shop I watch television for an hour. I
 then go out to play with my friend    
 James or go fishing with my cousin    
 Steven. I go inside at 8.00 and go to 
 bed at 10.00.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
