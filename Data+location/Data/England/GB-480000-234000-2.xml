		<content> Shenley Church End is bordered by the 
 ancient Roman Watling Street which has
 been adapted as part of the new city  
 grid road system and has been relieved
 of much of its through traffic by a   
 diversion. The winding single lane    
 linking the villages Shenley Church   
 End, Shenley Brook End and Whaddon has
 a single footpath and hedges on both  
 sides. It is used by buses to         
 Bletchley and Central Milton Keynes,  
 and school buses. Regular users are   
 farm tractors, horses, milk floats,   
 coalmen and the postlady on her       
 bicycle. The North Bucks Way, once a  
 major trade route, is now a footpath  
 marking part of the city boundary. As 
 the city expands westwards, the       
 Shenleys will be bypassed by new grid 
 roads, and minor roads serving        
 housing, shops and schools form part  
 of the future development.            </content>
