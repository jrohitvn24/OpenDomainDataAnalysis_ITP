		<title>03The School in Taddington</title>
		<content>     Our school began about 1714 when  
 the Rev.Roger Wilkson left some land  
 at Biggin for it. At first it was held
 in a barn at Priestcliffe.In 1847 a   
 proper building was erected in        
 Taddington and enlarged in 1926 when  
 White's School was closed.It now has  
 oil-fired central heating and its own 
 kitchen unit.Though the school bell   
 has gone its kennel remains on the    
 infant classroom roof.We have a big   
 field to play on as well as a hard    
 surfaced playground but both slope.   
     The school day is from 9 to 15.15 
 with an hour for dinner.The juniors go
 swimming once a week,and learn to play
 recorders and melodicas.We all do some
 woodwork and even the boys do some    
 needlework.We have a computer.The     
 leavers are always given dictionaries 
 as parting presents.There are now only
 twenty pupils and two teachers.       </content>
