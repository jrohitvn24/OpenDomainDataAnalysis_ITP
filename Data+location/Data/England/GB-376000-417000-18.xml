		<title>18THE GRANTS OF RAMSBOTTOM</title>
		<content> On the southern edge of our block is a
 public house in Ramsbottom Market     
 Place called the Grant Arms. The      
 building was once the home of William 
 and Daniel Grant,who came from        
 Speyside in Scotland to set up a      
 textile business in 1773. They chose  
 Ramsbottom as an ideal place,and in   
 the course of the next ten years built
 up a successful business. The Grants  
 became known as caring and generous   
 employers,concerned with the welfare  
 and education of their workers. They  
 built local schools,churches,and good 
 housing for them.Their fame as ideal  
 employers spread far and wide,so much 
 so that the author{Charles Dickens    
 used them as the model for the        
 kind-hearted Cheeryble Brothers in    
 "Nicholas Nickleby".
