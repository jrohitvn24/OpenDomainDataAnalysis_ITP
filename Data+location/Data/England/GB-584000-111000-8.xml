		<title>08HOUSING, FAIRLIGHT E. SUSSEX</title>
		<content> Fairlight, East Sussex expanded       
 considerably during the l960's when   
 land at Fairlight Cove was made       
 available for retired people to buy.  
 Individually designed detached        
 bungalows built of brick with tiled   
 roofs and gas-fired central heating   
 were constructed.   The bungalows are 
 near Hastings Country Park and the    
 village shop, and some face the sea.  
 Three bedroomed properties cost about 
 Â£60,000 and two bedroomed cost Â£50,000
                                       
 l9th century houses, mostly detached, 
 and some short terraces can be seen   
 along Fairlight, Pett and Rye Roads,  
 and 20th century houses and bungalows 
 fill the gaps between the older       
 properties forming the ribbon         
 development of Pett and Fairlight.    
 Farmhouses are scattered throughout   
 the area.                             </content>
