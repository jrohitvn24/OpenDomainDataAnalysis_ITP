		<title>18Games Children Play</title>
		<content> Some children bring tennis balls to   
 school and play catch or piggy in the 
 middle.Sometimes we get skipping ropes
 out and have races.Sometimes we play  
 tag on lines or just tag.In tag one   
 person is 'on it'.That person has to  
 chase after other people the first    
 person that they touch is then 'on it'
 and so on.Tag on lines is is the same 
 sort of game but it is made harder    
 because you have to stay on the       
 lines.If you come off the lines then  
 you are 'on it'.When I am at home I   
 play on two oil drums which we found  
 in the river.We did put a plank across
 them but it broke while we were       
 rocking on it.We also play cricket and
 rounders.If it is raining we play     
 games on our computer.Or we play      
 monopoly and other board games.Or I   
 play marbles or cards.
