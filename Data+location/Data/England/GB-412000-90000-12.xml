		<title>12SPORT IN BOURNEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   THERE ARE MANY INTERESTING FACTS    
 ABOUT SPORT IN BOURNEMOUTH, FOR       
 EXAMPLE, BOURNEMOUTH HAS HAD A TEAM IN
 THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE FOR WELL OVER 50  
 YEARS BUT THEY HAVE NEVER SUCCEEDED IN
 GETTING HIGHER THAN THE THIRD         
 DIVISION.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME       
 NOTABLE F.A. CUP EXPERIENCES, HOWEVER,
 AND IN THE PAST THEY HAVE BEATEN FIRST
 DIVISION TEAMS LIKE MANCHESTER UNITED,
 SPURS, WOLVERHAMPTON AND NEWCASTLE.   
 AT THE MOMENT HARRY REDKNAPP IS       
 BOURNEMOUTH'S MANAGER AND THEY PLAY AT
 DEAN COURT WHERE AVERAGE GATES ARE    
 APPROXIMATELY 3,500 WITH A HIGHEST    
 EVER ATTENDANCE OF 25,000.            
   HAMPSHIRE CRICKET CLUB OFTEN PLAY   
 MATCHES AT DEAN PARK AND MANY NOTABLE 
 WORLD CLASS PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED THERE 
 INCLUDING SIR LEN HUTTON, COLIN       
 COUDREY, IAN BOTHAM AND GARY SOBERS.
