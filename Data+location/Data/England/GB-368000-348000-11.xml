		<title>11Leisure Activities</title>
		<content>  There are not many amenities for the 
 use of leisure time in Wybunbury. The 
 village has a Village Hall, where a   
 Youth Club and occasional village     
 activities are held.There is a playing
 field equipped with swings and a      
 roundabout; there is a disused quarry 
 which is full of water and is used by 
 Wybunbury Anglers.                    
                                       
  Hough has a common which is open to  
 anyone for leisure activities.        
                                       
  There are, however many local        
 footpaths crossing the local farmland 
 and linking areas of local interest.  
                                       
 The three village hosteleries         
 advertise their activities in the     
 local press and these include from    
 time to time live entertainment and   
 organised Caravan Club Rallies.       </content>
