		<content>   St Mary's Church, or more fully, the
 parish church of St Mary the Virgin,  
 once formed part of a Benedictine     
 Priory and the present church building
 represents only half of the original  
 monastic church. The tower, which is  
 81 feet (25m) high, is a notable local
 landmark.                             
   An interesting feature of the nave  
 is the series of corbels at the tops  
 of the columns supporting the roof.   
 These are portraits of people such as 
 King Richard II who were associated   
 with the parish or with the 14th      
 century rebuilding of the church. The 
 chancel contains a fine stone effigy  
 of Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford,
 which originally stood before the high
 altar of the priory church. On the    
 south side of the chancel is the      
 library, built in 1708, which houses a
 fine and valuable collection of books.</content>
