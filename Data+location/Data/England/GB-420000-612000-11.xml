		<title>11TURKEY FARMING</title>
		<content>  {Mr. Vickers}at{Hawkhill}gets his {  
{turkeys}at a few days old.He keeps    
 them in a special unit with a heater  
 which keeps the baby birds at the     
 right temperature.When they are old   
 enough they are moved to pens where   
 each bird is allowed about 3 sq.ft. He
 uses suction watering methods and they
 are fed on sunflower seeds. He keeps  
 them to varying stages of their       
 development selling some to be        
 fattened and keeping others until they
 are big enough to be eaten.Sometimes  
 in cold weather the turkeys huddle    
 together and suffocate so Mr.Vickers  
 has to provide extra heat.One of his  
 biggest problems is{rats}which attack 
 and kill the turkeys.A new venture has
 been to introduce 2 pairs of{owls}into
{surrounding woodland}to try to        
 eliminate the rats without using      
{poison.                               </content>
