		<title>06BUSES WEST OF THE EXE.</title>
		<content>   Exeter is the first place in Britain
 to try out a minibus system. There are
 15 minibuses on the St.Thomas route   
 the first bus starts at 6.20am and    
 the last bus finishes at 23.40pm. A   
 minibus can be hailed at any place    
 that is not dangerous except in the   
 city centre. Minibuses run at 10      
 minute intervals and can seat 16      
 people with 3 standing. The double    
 decker buses have 74 seats and allow 8
 people standing.The first bus starts  
 at 5.05 and the last bus runs at      
 23.40. There are two bus stops in Fore
 Steet. These buses cross the River    
 Exe: G,J,M,B,C,D,P, 359,360,361 and   
 the minibuses. The average life of a  
 bus is 15 years. Buses are not        
 normally scrapped, they are bought by 
 other companys or put to another use  
 such as playbuses.
