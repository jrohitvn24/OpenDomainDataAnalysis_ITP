		<title>10 A Deputy's job at Whitemoor</title>
		<content>The job of an underground official     
commonly known as a deputy, is to      
supervise the safe working of all the  
workmen in his section. There are 21   
shifts a month, each consisting of 7   
1/4 hours, including an overtime shift 
which has to be worked as part of the  
contract of employment. The deputy     
liked having something different to do 
each day, as no two days were the same 
because of the conditions. He liked the
responibility which went with his job  
but disliked the enviroment. He had    
been working at Whitemoor for 6 years  
and explained that the underground     
roadways were wider and the technology 
much more sophisticated than at his    
previous pit. The deputy said that most
accidents are caused through neglect   
of the person involved to adhere to the
safety rules.                          
                                       </content>
