		<title>12Culm Davy Chapel Hemyock</title>
		<content> This is an Elizabethan building which 
 is a 'Chapel of Ease'within the Parish
 of Hemyock,the Rector being the       
 officiating Minister.Services are once
 a fortnight, attendance being, for    
 Communion:6-8, and for Evensong:10-12.
 There are in this present day,no other
 services or gatherings, such as Sunday
 School, women's meetings of Youth     
 groups. Order of Service is as laid   
 down by the Anglican Prayer Book and  
 follows the lines of the normal       
 Anglican Service. Other inhabitants of
 this area have however wide choice of 
 attending church or chapel in         
 Wellington and Hemyock. They are well 
 served by Church of England, Roman    
 Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, Wesleyan
 and the new Community Church in       
 Hemyock. It would appear that in 1985 
 Church attendance in this area is     
 above the National average.           </content>
