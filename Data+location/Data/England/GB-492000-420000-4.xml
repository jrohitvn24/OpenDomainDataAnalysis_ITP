		<title>04JOBS SURVEY DATA</title>
		<content> The  Survey  of  Occupations on page 3
 was carried out  by  children  listing
 the jobs  of  people  living in  their
 street.  There  are  children  in  the
 class from  all  the  streets  in  the
 village,  and  so,  while  the  survey
 is representative it is not exhaustive
 as the children were unable  to ident-
 ify all the occupations in their area.
 Some clarification of  the  survey  is
 necessary.   IN  BOTH  OUT   indicates
 people  who  work  exclusively within,
 in and out,  or  outside  the village.
 BUILDING  includes  associated  trades
 CARING includes those working  in  old
 peoples homes and hospitals,  nursing.
 CLERICAL  includes insurance, banking,
 estate  agents  and  drawing  offices.
 SCHOOL STAFF excludes teachers.       
 ENGINEERING motor and electrical      
 mechanics and the oil industry        
 FACTORIES cement works food processing</content>
