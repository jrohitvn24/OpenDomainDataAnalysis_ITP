		<content> East and Wst Markham lie either side  
 of a Keuper Marl Ridge.  Undulating   
 countryside flows from the higher area
 with heavy clay land larely devoted to
 arable farming.  Main crops are sugar 
 beet and rape, determined by EEc      
 subsidies.  Some rough grassland      
 exists adjacent to farms where sheep  
 and cattle graze lesser quantities of 
 wheat and barley are grown.  East     
 markham has substantial apple         
 orchards.  As agriculture has become  
 more mechanised some residential      
 property has been taken over by       
 professional people with no immediate 
 interests, and by workers at a nearby 
 colliery, and the trentside power     
 stations.  There is some recent       
 residential develpment in East Markham
 itself, othe wise the area has changed
 but little ove the century.  Askham   
 and west markham are farm based       </content>
