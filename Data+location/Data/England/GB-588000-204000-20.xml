  When you go into the Third Year you  
 take the same subjects as in the      
 previous year. However, early in this 
 year you are expected to choose your  
 options. This takes place in the      
 second half of the Christmas term.    
   There are four compulsory subjects  
 in the fourth year-  Maths,English,   
 Games and P.E.G.S."PEGS" is a non-exam
 subject and we deal with a variety of 
 topics during that time. You can then 
 choose six options but at least one of
 these must be a science and another   
 must be a language.                   
   By the end of the Spring term       
 options are fixed so that your        
 timetable can be sorted out. At the   
 end of the Summer term exams are taken
 and these help to decide whether you  
 take your options at "O"level or
