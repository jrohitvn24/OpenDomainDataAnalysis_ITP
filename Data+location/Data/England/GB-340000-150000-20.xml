		<title>20Changes in Harvesting</title>
		<content> Methods of harvesting both hay and    
 corn have changed dramatically over   
 the last 25 years.A binder was used to
 cut the corn and tie it into sheaves. 
 These were left in the field to dry.  
 The corn was stored in large ricks    
 thatched with straw.Later a threshing 
 machine came and separated the ears of
 corn from the stalk.All this took many
 weeks and now a combine harvester can 
 do it all in a few days.              
                                       
   All the information on these pages  
 was compiled by the children of Class 
 2 of Weare School in July 1985 with   
 help from many adults and other       
 children.
