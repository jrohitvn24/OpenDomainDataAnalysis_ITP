		<title>02Highbrook - Landscape</title>
		<content> The whole area occupies a small part  
 of the High Weald- an area of low     
 hills and valleys. Much of the land   
 has a cover of woodland giving the    
 impression that the fields are        
 clearings within a large wood.        
  Minor roads traverse the area,       
 generally in a north/south direction  
 following the ridges. There is only   
 one centre of habitation, Highbrook, a
 small hamlet with a village hall      
 and a church. All other dwellings are 
 isolated farmsteads or cottages       
 scattered fairly evenly throughout. To
 the south east are four hammer ponds  
  linked by a small stream flowing     
 north east to cross the lane at       
 Twyford in a ford. The climate tends  
 to be somewhat colder than the        
 surrounding low weald due to the      
 altitude of the ridges. Frost and snow
 lie longer on the north facing slopes.</content>
