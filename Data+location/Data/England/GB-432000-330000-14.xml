		<title>14A HOUSE IN SINFIN</title>
		<content> The age of my house is about 50 years 
 old,it has 5 rooms. Two of them are   
 bedrooms. My front garden is small,   
 only about 4 metres long.My back      
 garden is about 12 metres long. My    
 house is a brick built terraced house 
 there are other houses attached but   
 they are smaller. It is dark brown but
 half way up it stops to get a light   
 brown where it has been painted.It has
 slates on the top but one of them is  
 missing but no rain gets in so we are 
 all right. The council own the house  
 but soon my parents will own it so we 
 can paint it a different colour my dad
 will paint it white and we could sell 
 it. If he sells it we might move to   
 Chaddesden where my Grandma and Auntie
 live.
