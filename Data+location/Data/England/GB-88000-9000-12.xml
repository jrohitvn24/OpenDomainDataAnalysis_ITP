		<content> LIFE STYLE ON SCILLY                  
  We did a survey one Thursday morning 
 outside the Co_op we asked some people
 a few questions about the Life Style  
 on Scilly.We found out that the       
 majority of people went on holiday to 
 the Main Land twice a year there was  
 only one person who didn't go on      
 holiday.The most times someone went   
 was eight times.Most people prefer to 
 go by helicopter than by the boat or  
 Brymon which is a light aircraft firm.
  We asked some more people to complete
 our survey, we asked them if they     
 visited the hairdressers.Many answered
 once every six weeks.One out of       
 seventine does not visit the          
 hairdressers.                         
  Next was transport,we asked a few    
 more people who were passing by if    
 they traveLled by bicycle,car,moped,  
 motorbike,lorry,truck,van or walk.    </content>
