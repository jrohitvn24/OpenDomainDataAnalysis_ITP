 Nympsfield Long Barrow,a three        
 chambered tomb of the Neolithic Period
 2500BC.The mound was first excavated  
 in 1862 when the chambers were partly 
 destroyed.Later work uncovered a short
 passage from the east.Pottery vessels 
 and sixteen skeletons were found.The  
 shape of the mound is easy to see.    
  From the hill there is a clear view  
 of the River Severn and Vale of       
 Berkeley. The grazing land is rich in 
 meadow grasses,clovers,vetch and      
 insect life.Buckholt Wood covers part 
 of the hillside and Oak,Ash,Hawthorn, 
 Dogwood,Elder and Guelder Rose grow.
