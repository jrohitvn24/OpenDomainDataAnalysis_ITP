		<title>12Mr. Carter CONT.</title>
		<content>started , the slaughter house was next 
to the butcher which is now Seagers    
hardware shop which was owned by Mr.   
Revett who built another shop down the 
hill. Mr Carter worked there until the 
war when he went away as a soldier.    
When he came back he started afresh. He
has noticed many changes in Wickham;   
new houses, more people, pavements     
,curbs and tarmac on the roads. In his 
spare time he used to cycle and walk   
and he was a county boxer at one time. 
Now he has arthritis so he reads ,     
watches TV and is writing a book on the
things he knows about in Wickham,      
mainly for his family.
