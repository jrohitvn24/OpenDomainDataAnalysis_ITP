		<title>08Shopping in Melchbourne</title>
		<content> Melchbournd does not have any shops,  
 but even so, there is no necessity to 
 leave the village to get the weekly   
 shopping.                             
 Meat can be bought from the mobile    
 butcher from Rushden or an order      
 telephoned to the butcher in Kimbolton
 guarantees a meat delivery twice a    
 week. A fishman calls on a weekly     
 basis.                                
 Bread and groceries are available from
 the bakery at Dean who deliver twice a
 week to the village. There is also a  
 mobile shop that calls twice a week.  
 Vegetables can be bought from a       
 gentleman in the village.             
 The milkman also provides more than   
 just dairy produce. He also brings    
 eggs, potatoes, fruit juices, chickens
 and other grocery items.              
 Library books can be exchanged once a 
 fortnight on the mobile library.      </content>
