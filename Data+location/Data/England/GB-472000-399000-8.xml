		<title>08THE PARK, WESTWOODSIDE</title>
		<content>    In Westwoodside there is a{park.}It
 was founded in 1970.It was opened by a
 local builder who donated the land.   
 The{park}is situated south west of    
 Akeferry Road and takes up one and    
 a quarter acres. Before it was a{park 
 it was farmland, growing sugarbeet,   
 cereals and other arable crops. In    
 the{park}there is a swing, slide,     
 rocking horse, climbing frame and     
 goal posts.                           
    There is a{park}committee who look 
 after the{park,}they check it once a  
 year.Since its opening they have added
 a sand pit and some goal posts. In    
 future years they might add half of an
 acre to the park.They have very little
 trouble at the{park.}We find that the 
 most popualar time during which       
 children use the{park}is Saturday     
 afternoon, and each afternoon during  
 holidays.                             </content>
