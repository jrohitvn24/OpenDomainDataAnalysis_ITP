		<content> came from an earlier church that was  
 demolished and rebuilt.               
     There is a{figure}of a{knight in  
{armour}in the chancel. It is thought  
 to be Sir Samson Foliat who lived in  
 the village in 1249. He might have had
 the church built. He has crossed legs 
 and they are very bent which may mean 
 that he fought and was wounded in the 
 Crusades.                             
     The main part of the church, the  
{nave}was re-roofed in 1525 at the     
 order of{Katherine of Aragon,}who     
 owned land in Chilton Foliat. She     
 wrote to William Darrel of Littlecote 
 ordering him to deliver three oaks for
 the repair of the roof.This roof is   
 still there and is described as a     
 "waggon roof on carved wallposts".    
     The{gallery}was built in 1694 and 
 the villagers were asked to contribute
 to its erection.                      </content>
