 616.St.Leodegarius Church dates back  
 to 1127,although it has been restored 
 several times and formerly had a spire
 steeple.The main walls are old and the
 church retains many objects of        
 interest e.g.a Gothic doorway.Robert  
 de Basford dedicated the church which 
 he had built to a French saint.The    
 church was a thatched building with no
 seats.Two  of the bells are dated     
 1606 and one is much older.The largest
 bell bears an inscription.The floor   
 has been raised several times and was 
 raised half a yard in 1819.The        
 galleries were removed about 1850.The 
 registers commence 1561,that of       
 marriages 1568.These have been
