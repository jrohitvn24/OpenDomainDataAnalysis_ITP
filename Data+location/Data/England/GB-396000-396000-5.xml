		<content> There has been an improvement in      
 housing in Stalybridge. All have baths
 and running hot water. Electricity has
 replaced gas for lighting in the home,
 though gas is extensively used for    
 geating and cooking. A lot of terraced
 property has been knocked down. There 
 are many different types of houses-   
 terraced, town houses, detached and   
 semi-detached, bungalows, council and 
 private property. Some people dislike 
 the high rates. There has been        
 movement by people from house to      
 house. Wherever people have moved,    
 they have found their new neighbours  
 friendly. But in moving to new houses,
 people have often found the rooms to  
 be small. Some peolpe are unhappy to  
 live on the hillsides, especislly with
 the harsh winter weather. Others like 
 the view from the hills. Some feel    
 more trees could have been planted.   </content>
