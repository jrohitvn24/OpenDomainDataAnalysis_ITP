		<title>19Customs in Knypersley.</title>
		<content>  The local customs of the Knypersley  
area are largely those of North        
Saffordshire.                          
  Oatcakes,a type of pancake,are trad- 
itional of our area. We are the only   
place in England which makes them.     
  A one mile race held in this area    
every year attracts people from as far 
as Plymouth. The race ends at Mow Cop  
Castle and the prize for running the   
race under 6 mins. and 30 sec. is 600  
pounds.The race is up a steep hill!    
  Egging and flouring is a local custom
among the school children.On a pupil's 
birthday their friends throw eggs and  
flour over them.                       
  The Potters industrial two week      
holiday is unique to the Potteries     
area.This takes place in the last week 
of June and the first week of July.
