		<content>   The {Crossways Inn}has been reopened
 now after 18 months. The owners       
 went bankrupt and so they closed      
 down.They couldn't get new owners and 
 that's why it took 18 months for the  
 pub to re-open. Everyone in{Folly Gate
 is very pleased. They get a lot of    
 people in the pub since it has        
 re-opened.                            
   The most popular drink is beer.They 
 sell bar meals and also they sell     
 cigarettes and crisps.                
   They used to have a juke box.They   
 have a Space Invader game and children
 are not allowed to play on it. They   
 also have swings,slides and a climbing
 frame outside for the children to play
 on.They have picnic tables for all the
 customers to sit,drink and have a chat
 outside.                              
   The children are not allowed to sit 
 at the bar or buy a drink.            </content>
