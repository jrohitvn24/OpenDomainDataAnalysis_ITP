		<title>19THE LONDON GLIDING CLUB</title>
		<content> The London Gliding Club situated at   
 the foot of Dunstable Downs is the    
 largest in the country. The  steep    
 west-facing slope of the Downs forms  
 an obstruction to the prevailing wind,
 and produces an upcurrent. As many as 
 twenty gliders at a time can use this 
 wind.                                 
    The club, formed in 1930, has 450  
 members. It employs  instructors and  
 ground engineers but basic work is    
 done by volunteers. Members can fly   
 solo after about fifty flights with   
 instructors. Gliders are launched by a
 small winch or towed up by a small    
 areoplane.                            
   Hang gliders also are use the downs,
 but are regared  as a dangerous       
 nuisance by the Gliding Club.
