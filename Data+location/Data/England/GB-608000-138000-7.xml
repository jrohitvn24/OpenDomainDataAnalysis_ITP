		<content> Situated off Swan Lane,about a mile   
 from the main A20 road is "Birch's    
 Yard".This lies in a hollow near      
 Gibbins Brook and is a sprawling      
 collection of buildings and workshops 
 owned by Mr.Les Birch,a local         
 landowner and farmer.Many of these    
 buildings are given over to use by    
 small businesses each employing a     
 small number of people.These companies
 are engaged in servicing of cars and  
 agricultural machinery,vehicle body   
 repair welding, pattern making,metal  
 spinning,haulage, civil engineering   
 and plant hire and they constitute the
 only source of light or heavy industry
 within this village.                  
 The yard is also used by Mr.Birch for 
 the storing of vintage traction       
 engines which he has restored to full 
 working order.
