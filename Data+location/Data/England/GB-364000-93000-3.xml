		<content> Wrackleford Estate covers the         
 sout-west facing chalk hillside       
 running to the River Frome. Two       
 dairies are the main enterprise       
 because of the good grass conditions, 
 but barley and wheat are also grown   
 for animal feed and sometimes malting.
 Strip cultivation was in operation    
 until very late in the nineteenth     
 century.  The fields are now much     
 larger; many hedges have been removed 
 to accomodate much larger machinery.  
 Tractors, fuel tanks and machinery    
 appropriate for every job are seen in 
 the sheds and barns scattered from    
 Grimstone to Wrackleford.             
 Stratton Farm is the centre for       
 calf-rearing, pesticide stores,       
 fertilisers and straw, now stored in  
 rolls for bedding. Pheasants are      
 reared for several shoots.
