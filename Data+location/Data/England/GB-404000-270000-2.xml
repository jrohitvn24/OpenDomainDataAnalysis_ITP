		<content> In the small village of Rowney Green, 
 there are many little roads which are 
 quite dense, very narrow and also     
 winding, most of these roads are      
 relatively busy with farming          
 machinery.  As well as being a fairly 
 remote villae Rowney Green has a very 
 poor system of public transport.      
 There are only two bus services during
 the week, one of which is on a Tuesday
 and the other on Friday.  It collects 
 the villagers at the Old Post Office  
 and takes them into Reditch to do     
 shopping etc. and it returns three    
 hours later. With this system as you  
 can gather many villagers rely on     
 their own transport.  But many are    
 happy with this. A new link to the M42
 is opening in 1985/6 on the Northern  
 edge of Rowney Green.  There is much  
 discussion as to whether this is a    
 good idea or not.                     </content>
