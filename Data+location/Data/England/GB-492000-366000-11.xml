		<content> The large amount of inland water      
 attracts many different kinds of      
 birds. There are                      
 mallard,grebe,swans,tufted duck,      
 moorhens and coot.The banks provide   
 nesting places.                       
 There also are finches,sparrows,      
 starlings,bluetits,chaffinches,       
 robins, gulls,pigeons,thrushes,       
 and owls,to mention some of those more
 frequently seen.                      
 In the summer they are joined by      
 swallows,martins,swifts and the often 
 heard but seldom seen,cuckoo.         
 We take the birds for granted as      
 everyday occurences.We can see        
 woodpeckers,skylarks,magpies and      
 yellow hammers too.                   
 As well as birds there are            
 gamebirds,rabbits,squirrels and  foxes
 in the woods.
