		<title>11Slaughtering Process of Cows</title>
		<content>    The firm has been open about 45    
 years. The first stage in the         
 slaughtering of a cow is to record the
 ticket number which was stuck on the  
 cow at the market. The cow is then    
 shot and hung on an overhead rail     
 where it is drained of blood. Next the
 head is removed. Then the skin is     
 opened around the the back legs and   
 down the middle of the underside of   
 the carcass. After that the skin on   
 the front legs is opened and the front
 legs are chained to a post. A chain is
 attached to the loose skin and hooked 
 onto a Hide Puller, as the chain      
 tightens, the skin is removed. Then   
 the stomach and offal is removed. The 
 final stage is splitting down the     
 backbone and washing the two sides of 
 beef. This completes the 'dressing' of
 the carcass.  Much of the meat is sent
 to France and Germany.                </content>
