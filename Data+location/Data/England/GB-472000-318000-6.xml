		<content>{Roads:Melton Mowbray's roads are quite
{congested. To help the congestion, a  
{one way system was introduced some    
{years ago. An inner relief road was   
{opened in the summer of 1985 has      
{allowed the traffic to flow more      
{smoothly. It has also allowed part of 
{the town centre to be pedestrianised. 
{                                      
{Railways:Until 1953 Melton Mowbray had
{three railways lines and two railway  
{stations. Now there is only one       
{station and one railway line which    
{runs from Peterborough to Birmingham  
{via Stamford, Oakham, Melton Mowbray, 
{Leicester and Nuneaton.

{Buses:Melton Mowbray is served by     
{three bus companies:Midland Red,      
{Lincolnshire Road Car and Bartons. }
