		<content>{Farming.}The greater part of the      
 area is undulating land with a maximum
 height of 89 metres.farming is        
 generally mixed arable and livestock. 
 In many cases the farmland is owned by
 a country landowner. Farming is done  
 by tenant farmers,a number of whom    
 have been doing so for 30 or 40 years.
 There is a band of poor{wetland       
 running West to East across the middle
 of the area which has numerous manmade
 drainage ditches which only partially 
 solve the problem.The farmhouses are  
 built of the local light brown        
 sandstone and the fields are bound by 
 fences and hedges.                    
{Golf.}There is an 18 hole golf course 
 which lies to the East of the village 
 of Ponteland.It covers an area of     
 almost half a square kilometre and    
 draws its members from Ponteland and  
 the surrounding area.                 </content>
