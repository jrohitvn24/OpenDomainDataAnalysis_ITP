		<content>    The 620 acres of land are owned by 
 the Duchy of Cornwall. The tenant     
 farmer uses methods of intensive      
 cultivation, spraying crops with      
 fungicides, weed killers and          
 fertilisers in order to increase the  
 yield. The use of tractors and other  
 forms of mechanisation enables him to 
 reduce the cost of labour. Rents are  
 so high that he has to use highly     
 competitive methods in order to meet  
 the costs.                            
                                       
    Together with two men he can       
 maintain a herd of 31 cattle and, in  
 addition, raises 160 calves which,    
 after two years, are sold for beef.   
 He grows crops of hay and silage to   
 feed the animals and wheat and barley 
 to sell to the grain merchants.
