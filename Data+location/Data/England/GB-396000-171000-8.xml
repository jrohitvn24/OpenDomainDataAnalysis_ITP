		<title>08Dumb Post Inn,Bremhill.</title>
		<content> This popular inn was once part of     
 the Bowood Estate of the Earl of      
 Shelburne.                            
   It is believed the inn got it's name
 from the custom of mailmen on carrier 
 waggons pinning letters on a post out 
 side the inn for the local people,in  
 the days before the Royal Mail.       
   This georgian inn has 200 year old  
 documents,a copy of the rules of the  
 Dumb Post Friendly Society 1770.This  
 was a sick benefit or thrift club.    
   These old documents describe the    
 Club Walk in Whit Week, a trek from   
 the inn to the village cross,a service
 in St.Martin's Church,and a village   
 day of feasting and celebration.      
   The Dumb Post is a very popular inn 
 for summer visitors and many ask to   
 see the old documents.
