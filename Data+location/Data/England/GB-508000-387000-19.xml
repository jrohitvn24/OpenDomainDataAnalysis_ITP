		<title>19MARKET RASEN-A CHILD'S VIEW</title>
		<content> This is an eleven year old girl's idea
 of a typical day in Market Rasen from 
 her point of view."My name is         
 Elizabeth and I live opposite the     
 Race-Course. My day begins at 7       
 o'clock and after washing etc. my     
 brother and I go to school. We live   
 about 1 mile from the Primary School  
 and mum takes us in the car. We start 
 our school day with Assembly in the   
 hall and the morning usually has      
 Maths. and English. Project work      
 usually is in the afternoon. Our      
 school has a large hall and PE is fun.
 We also have a swimming pool and      
 tennis courts which we use in the     
 summer. My evenings are usually spent 
 watching television but at the        
 weekends and holidays we walk or cycle
 in the country. We are very lucky to  
 have lovely open countryside all      
 around us.I like the woods too.       </content>
