		<title>16WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 1985</title>
		<content> Most daily modern things in this world
 are electric like radios with buttons 
 to turn it off and on, and a circular 
 button to tune into a station to get  
 some music. I like to listen to the   
 radio because it is not just one sort 
 of music.There is pop, classical, Rock
 and Roll and lots of others. I like   
 Rock and Roll best because it is good 
 for dancing to. There is a Rhodes     
 Centre in Bishops Stortford where you 
 can go to dance. My brother plays all 
 my dad's old rock and roll records on 
 his record player which is electric.  
 Lots of people use electric things    
 every day. Most children watch        
 television every day. Mothers use     
 electric washing machines. Most       
 fathers use electric things in their  
 workshops and other places in the     
 home.                                 
                                       </content>
