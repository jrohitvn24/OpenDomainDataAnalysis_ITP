		<title>03THE LEN VALLEY BOTTOM</title>
		<content> Although the Len is a minor river     
 running in a shallow valley the region
 is fairly flat and affords good       
 communication routes for the A.20 and 
 the railway between Ashford and       
 Maidstone. The soil is fertile and    
 easily worked giving good pasture as  
 well as arable farming and            
 horticulture.  Very little wetland is 
 found except that near streams and    
 ponds.  Many springs rise from the    
 base of the chalk where it overlays   
 the Gault clay, but are of little     
 importance today.  Extensive beds of  
 building sand of the Folkestone beds  
 have been worked in the recent past   
 but none are in current use.  Many of 
 these quarries are being or will be   
 infilled with domestic refuse.
