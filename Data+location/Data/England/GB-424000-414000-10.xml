   A Flockton-born benefactor of       
 Flockton he entered the coal industry 
 in the early years of the 17th        
 century, and eventually owned his  own
 mine. As a result of his success he   
 was able to build in the 1690's a     
 chapel. In his will, he provided an   
 endowment of the chapel for a         
 minister; the building of three       
 almshouses, and also an endowment on  
 the school already existing. The      
 almshouses and school still exist, and
 the endowments he made have had a     
 significant influence on the life of  
 the church and school for many years, 
 although being of fixed amounts they  
 are now worth very little.
