		<title>13 Westmoor Cubs and Brownies</title>
		<content> I go to the 1st Westmoor Cub pack on  
Tuesday evening.We meet in the Middle  
School Annexe.We start with Grand      
Howl, then we give in our subs and we  
have Inspection. Akela, our leader,    
looks at our uniforms and he gives     
points for cleanliness and tidiness.   
Then we play games. One of my          
favourites is called Kim. Akela        
collects everybody's shoes, then he    
turns the lights out.He muddles all    
the shoes up, then shouts, "Go," and   
everyone has to find their own shoes   
in the dark.  Next we do badges. I     
like the cubs. It gives you something  
to do. We play football, go to camp    
and have trips out.    Craig Johnson   
When I go to Brownies, there are a lot 
of people there. The groups are called 
Kelpies, Elves, Imps and Sprites. We   
collect  our subs, then we play games  
like "Traffic Lights". Everyone walks  </content>
