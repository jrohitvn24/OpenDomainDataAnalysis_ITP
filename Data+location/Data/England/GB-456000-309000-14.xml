		<title>14SHOPPING IN BIRSTALL</title>
		<content> Birstall is fortunate in having a wide
 variety of small shops. There are     
 small groups on Kingsgate Ave. and    
 Windmill Ave. but the main group is on
 Sibson Rd. Most of the daily needs can
 be bought locally.                    
    However, 2 years ago a large       
 supermarket and shopping centre was   
 built 2 miles away at{Beaumont Leys.  
 When local shopkeepers were asked by  
 us if their trade had been affected,  
 most said, "Yes" but some were more   
 concerned with Birstall:{"A poor      
{mixture of shops, too many chemists,  
{banks and building societies."        
    One shop keeper commented,{"People 
{in Birstall want a personal, friendly 
{service. We can provide that."        
    The manager of{International Stores
 said that he makes a point of walking 
 around the supermarket talking to     
 customers and checking the service.   </content>
