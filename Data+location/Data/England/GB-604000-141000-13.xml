		<title>13BROOK PRIMARY SCHOOL 1</title>
		<content>Brook Primary School was built in 1876,
but wasn't opened until 1877.It is a   
small village school which still has   
the original window panes. It consists 
of 2 mobiles and one classroom.        
Altogether, in the whole school there  
are 44 children.The first teacher at   
the school was there for 30 years. The 
next teacher was there for  only 6     
years as she wasn't very good. Then    
another teacher came and was there for 
40 years.There are still air-raid      
shelters at the school left from World 
War 2 where the present headteacher    
found photographs and old school       
records which is how we know the       
history of the school. The infants are 
between 5 and 7 and the juniors 8 and  
11.Most children live locally but some 
travel from other areas as they prefer 
a village school.
