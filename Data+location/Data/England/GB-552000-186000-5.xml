		<content>      Mr. and Mrs. K. are old-age      
 pensioners.   They have lived in      
 Hornchurch for a long time.   In the  
 1930s there were few roads and a lot  
 of fields.   They bought the land     
 behind Dorian Road in 1938 and sold it
 in 1983.   When they first came here  
 there were small shops in place of    
 Sainsbury's supermarket.   They also  
 remember the old fire station in      
 Billet Lane.                          
      Mr. K. used to cycle miles along 
 country roads every day just to get to
 work.   When they first moved to this 
 area they could walk in a straight    
 line from Dorian Road to Elm Park.    
 Now it is a built up area             
      They used to cultivate vegetables
 in 130 feet of land.   Now that they  
 do not own the land behind their house
 they rent an allotment behind our     
 school.                               </content>
