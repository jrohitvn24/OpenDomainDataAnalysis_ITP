		<content>     Our area is mainly farmland,either
 crops such as wheat, barley, sugar    
 beet, potatoes and rape, or grass left
 to be  cut as silage and hay. Some is 
 used as grazing land as well. A lot of
 the farmland is privately owned, with 
 companies such as GALLIFORD LTD and   
 COVENTRY CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY taking  
 parts of it. It contains the small    
 village of BURTON HASTINGS as well as 
 other houses scatterd over the        
 farmland. The M69 motorway,which      
 joins the M1 and M6, runs through our 
 area. It comes from COVENTRY to       
 LEICESTER. The only church is         
 St.Botolph's in Burton Hastings.A     
 large area is taken up with BRAMCOTE  
 BARRACKS which covers just over 1SqKm.
 The Ashby de la Zouch canal           
 runs through part of the area. It has 
 6 bridges passing over it.
