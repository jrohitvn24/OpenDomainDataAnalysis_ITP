		<content> Her mother ran a sewing class for the 
 ladies of the village.She bought the  
 bales of material and charged them a  
 shilling a week.My stepfather was     
 William Henry Green.He gave the       
 statue of Lady Godiva to Coventry. I  
 don't want the village spoilled. They 
 have put up 64 signs in the village   
 recently.                             
 Mr Murray - I was born in this house  
 and I have lived here for 74 years. My
 dad lived all his life here too. We   
 never left the village. I went to     
 school here. The council bought the   
 shoes for the kids who walked from    
 Sheepy. I left school at 14, the year 
 the school closed 1937. I went to work
 for Mr Dawkins in farming.He owned the
 land afore Corbett bought it when     
 Dawkins sold up. I went to work at    
 Pooley Colliery for 30 years. I don't 
 leave the village very often.         </content>
