		<content> Although few plants grow under the    
 pine trees, the fringe areas and river
 banks are worth studying. In Breckland
 as a whole are to be found Spanish    
 Catchfly, Spring Speedwell, Hounds    
 Tongue, Meadow Saxifrage and Mahonia  
 Japonica. Also in certain areas on    
 walls and gravestones many lichens and
 mosses occur.                         
 With help from the F.C., 4 kinds of   
 deer roam the forest (Red, Fallow, Roe
 and Muntjac). They are herded to      
 prevent damage to young trees and save
 them from poachers. There are many    
 Grey Squirrels and few Red ones. Moles
 and Mice are common as are the        
 riverside mammals. The remaining      
 Rabbits and Hares have to be          
 controlled although Myxamotosis aided 
 the depletion of Rabbits.
