		<content> John is now working in Huddersfield   
  and the family travel to             
 Manchester or other towns roundabout. 
 They also have relatives scattered    
 over England &amp; Scotland and make      
 visits to see them from time to time. 
 The family is settled in Littleborough
 they like the life here and find the  
 people friendly.The children-Jake aged
 eight years &amp; Megan aged six years    
 attend Stansfield Hall School,which is
 a small school,very much part of the  
 community and the children have       
 settled very happily there.They find  
 Littleborough a particulary attractive
 country area.Littleborough however    
 does lack some of the amenities which 
 would be available in a larger        
 city,and it would be good to see the  
 facilities in the area improved.
