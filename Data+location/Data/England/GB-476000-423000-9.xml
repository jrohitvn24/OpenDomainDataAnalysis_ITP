		<title>09A Special Day Out</title>
		<content>  Not long ago I was on Holiday with my
 family in{Blackpool.}While I was there
 I went to see a show on the{North Pier
 with my Grandad and two sisters.We had
 good seats,seven rows from the front. 
  The stars of the show were{Les Dennis
 and{Dustin Gee}.Unfortunately{Dustin} 
 had stomach pains and so could not    
 appear.Also in the show was{Vince Hill
 ,some dancers and some puppets.As{Les 
{Dennis}was on his own he had to       
 pretend that he was{Vera Duckworth}as 
 well as{Mavis Riley}from{Coronation   
{Street.Vince Hill}sang some old       
 fashioned songs that I didn't like    
 very much!I had only heard of one of  
 his songs which was{'Hello'}by{Lionel 
{Ritchie.}The puppets came on next and 
 at one time they were made to cry.I   
 think they had a squirter inside them.
 It was a good show but{Les Dennis}was 
 best.                                 </content>
