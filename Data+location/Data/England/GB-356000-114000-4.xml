		<content>{South Somerset's major newspaper media
{publisher.}When we got to the Western 
 Gazette we talked to the reporters.We 
 found out that the Chief Reporter had 
 been working there for 24             
 years.Another of the reporters said   
 that it was great fun working         
 there.{The paper started in           
{1737 as the Sherborne and Dorset      
{Mercury.}In 1744 it combined with the 
 Sherborne Flying Post.At one time they
 used an old fashioned type writer but 
 now they use computers.They sell{63000
{copies each week.}The Western Gazette 
 is sold in 5 counties in England.We   
 looked at a Western Gazette that was  
 100 years old.News in 1885 included a 
 dispute about Afghanistan and the     
 resignation of Primeminister          
 Gladstone.In 1985 the stories are much
 more local.The company has 250        
 workers.                              </content>
