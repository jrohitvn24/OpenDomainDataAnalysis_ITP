		<content> Every year the children from the      
 fourth year at Newport Junior School, 
 leave the school to stay in a Youth   
 Hostel or a hotel.This gives us a     
 chance to look after ourselves and to 
 be independent.The Head Mistress,Mrs. 
 Walker and our class teacher,Mrs.Watt,
 lead these adventures.This year,1985, 
 we  went to Middle Head Outdoor       
 Pursuits Centre.We were given the     
 opportunity to rock climb and to      
 abseil down a forty foot rock face.It 
 was great.                            
 We are often given the opportunity to 
 meet children from other schools when 
 we meet them to play matches of       
 netball or football.At the end of the 
 Summer term we invite the fourth year 
 children, from the junior schools that
 feed into Howden Comprehensive,to our 
 Recreation field, just to make friends
 and play games together.Linda Moverley</content>
