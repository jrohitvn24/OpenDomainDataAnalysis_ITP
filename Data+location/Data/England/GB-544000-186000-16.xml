		<content> My{parent's business}is making "Jeans"
 for work and for fashion, and{selling 
 them.{Jeans}come in different styles  
 and fabric. They use course cotton or 
 'cord' or comfortable stretchy fabric.
 Levis Strauss was the original creator
 of jeans and we sell his make and     
 others like "Wranglers. Prices range  
 from Â£17 for working jeans to more    
 than Â£3O for{fashion}jeans like "Pepe"
 or "Fiourouchi" but some of these may 
 be out of fashion in a few years.     
 Jeans can be styled with up to five   
 pockets, be plain or have pleats in   
 front: they can be loose or fit skin  
 tight. There are three colours; the   
 natural blue, stone-wash where pumice 
 stones wash some of the blue out and  
 bleached white. Styles can change at  
 any time due to public demand.
