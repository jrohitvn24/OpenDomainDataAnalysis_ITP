		<title>08BRACEBRIDGE HEATH RESERVOIR</title>
		<content>  In 1904/5 a typhoid epidemic in      
 Lincoln resulted in 131 deaths.       
 Contaminated water supplies were      
 blamed and it was necessary to        
 improve the quality of the supply.    
 A new source of supply at Elkesley,   
 Notts was used and from 1911 to the   
 present day water pumped from Elkesley
 goes into Westgate water tower with   
 the surplus passed by gravitation to  
 Bracebridge Heath Reservoir.          
  It is a covered Reservoir with a     
 capacity of six million gallons which 
 serves the low districts of Lincoln as
 well as Bracebridge Heath and R.A.F.  
 Waddington. It has recently had a     
 booster station fitted and been linked
 to Leaderham service reservoir.
