		<content>   The area that we have called{       
{Bowcombe}after the only small hamlet  
 within its boundaries, lies to the    
 south-west of{Newport;}the Island's   
 principal town. It is{mainly          
{agricultural land,}consisting of four 
 farms contained mainly within it, and 
 some land belonging to farms outside. 
 The rest of the area; roughly one     
 quarter, consists of{forest,}most of  
 this being coniferous managed by the  
 Forestry Commission, and some         
 deciduous woodland. The area is a     
{valley,}hence the suffix "combe", with
 gently undulating hills on either side
 of the single road which winds along  
 the valley floor. The nature of the   
 area with its small population makes  
 it ideal for walking. It has one major
 landmark; the tall mast of{Rowridge:} 
 the BBC radio and television          
 transmitter.                          </content>
