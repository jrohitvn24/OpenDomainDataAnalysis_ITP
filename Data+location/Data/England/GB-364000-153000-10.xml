 Over the entrance of the Town Hall is 
 a carving of a young woman's          
 head.Sarah Ann Jones lived with her   
 husband Frank in a miners cottage in  
 Church Square.It was the job of the   
 women,in those days,to have children  
 and look after their husbands.Sarah   
 Ann had eight children,four boys and  
 four girls.In 1859 a new Market Hall  
 (Town Hall) was built.Each day Sarah  
 would take the yolk and 2 pails to    
 fetch their daily water at St.Chads   
 Well.She stopped each day to see how  
 the building was going on and one day 
 a stone mason asked if he could sketch
 her face.He then carved her face in   
 stone and it was placed over the front
 door.Sarah had some unhappiness in her
 lifetime.Her husband was killed in the
 Welton Pit and her son,Drummer Frank  
 died,aged 17,at the Norton Hill Mine. </content>
