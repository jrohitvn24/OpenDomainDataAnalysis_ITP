		<title>09AN ALSAGER SMALLHOLDING</title>
		<content> On the small holding there is a sow   
 and five piglets, 102 ducks, 2        
 cockerels, 12 hens, (some of which    
 were hatched at school) 1 cat and 3   
 dogs. He also grows crops: potatoes,  
 peas, turnips, cabbages, sprouts,     
 leeks and hay. He gets up at half     
 past 6 in the morning in the winter   
 and later in the summer. He sells and 
 gives crops and animals to relations  
 and friends. He has got a tractor and 
 nearly all the machinery for it. The  
 small holding is only a hobby, his    
 real job is as an engineer at the     
 Royal Ordnance Factory at Radway      
 Green. He makes 27 millimetre         
 aircraft cannon shells. When he was   
 little he had relations who had a farm
 and when he was 14 years old he       
 decided that he would have a small    
 holding.
