		<content> The Service Department maintains      
 roads and bridges. The roads are made 
 from block stone covered by asphalt or
 tarmac.They lay down 'cats-eyes' and  
 white lines made from thermo-plastic  
 with Ballatoni reflectors. They also  
 re-cover the roads every three years. 
 The road is re-surfaced; either with a
 thick layer of asphalt or tarmac by a 
 machine called a Blaw-Knox, or by     
 spraying bitumen and sprinkling       
 chippings and stones on top.          
 In the cold weather they use three    
 thousand tons of salt to cover five   
 hundred miles of road each year. The  
 salt comes from the I.C.I. salt mines 
 in Winsford, Cheshire.                
 Ten years ago, 110 people used to work
 for the Highways Department, but today
 they have only 40.  The men work a    
 normal day with no shifts, although   
 someone is always on emergency call.  </content>
