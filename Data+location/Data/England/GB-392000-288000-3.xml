 throughout the year with schools and  
 churches and numerous organisations

 by a{procession}of colourful floats   
 and a previously elected carnival     
 queen. The staging of{Black Country   
{markets,}often held in the evening    
 is a custom that has recently been    
 revived and is extremely popular.

 local organisation followed by
