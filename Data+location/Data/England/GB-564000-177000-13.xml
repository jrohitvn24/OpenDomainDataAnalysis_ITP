 the{Manor School}in Tilbury. This has 
 approximately{450 children}in its     
 classes and includes a large          
 purpose-built nursery school for the  
 3 and 4 year olds. This building is   
 partially funded by the Community Help
 Project and includes a post for a     
 Liasion Officer who works with both   
 school and parents at home.It         
 originally came about because of the  
 number of disadvantaged families there

 closed some time ago and is now used
