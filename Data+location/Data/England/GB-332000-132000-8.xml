		<content>     This is a rural area  and has been
 drained by ditches called{rhynes.}The 
 land being marshy,attracts birds like 
{Herons and Kingfishers,}as well as the
 usual species one would expect to find
 in the West of England.Local groups   
 are concerned to maintain much of the 
 land uncultivated to retain the       
 natural habitat for the marsh loving  
 plants birds and animals.             
      There is also opposition to the  
 process of drainage which is gradually
 rendering the ground fit for pasture  
 and in many cases the cultivation of  
 crops.                                
    {Elm trees}were very common here   
 but have been decimated by{Dutch Elm  
 disease.                              
     A great deal of litter finds its  
 way on to the pathways and is a sad   
 reflection on some peoples lack of    
 care for the countryside.             </content>
