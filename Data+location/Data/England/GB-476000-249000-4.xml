Although near main routes,for a long   
time the Royal forest kept this area   
isolated.The Northampton rail loop was 
built after nearly every other city had
been connected to the rail system.Its  
only purpose locally was to provide    
jobs temporarily and keep half of      
Ashton warmer by 2 degrees C by making 
a barrier to cold air flowing downhill 
from Hartwell.The villages are poorly  
served by unclassified roads on which  
there have been several bad accidents. 
Winter driving is always dangerous.As  
Hartwell is supposed to be a dormitory 
village for Northampton &amp; Milton Keynes
it is srange the roads shouldbe bad.As 
the M1 passes right by Hartwell a link 
to it would have helped but only a     
police turning point that leads to the 
forest exists and ordinary traffic is  
not supposed to use it.Nicola Maltby,11</content>
