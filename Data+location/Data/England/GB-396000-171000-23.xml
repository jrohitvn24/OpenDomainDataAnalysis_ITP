The court yard at Sainsbury’s in Calne was the first project by the Calne artists group. Until recent years Calne was an English market town in decline with conservation-type buildings ruthlessly knocked down. Then in 1982 the 100-year-old Harris factory closed, leaving a huge derelict site-part of which is where the new Sainsbury’s store now stands. The town’s response was to set up the Calne project, an environmental watch dog group. Out of this grew the Calne artists. Working with Sainsbury’s architects, the group came up with craft-works which are themed round the town’s agricultural and industrial history, Motifs include early Celtic artifacts, the local landscape and Wiltshire’s famous corn circles. Alan Tilbury contributed two tree’s seats in English oak and fabricated steel, plus a low concave ‘arbour’ seat, while David Reeves designed an ornate forecourt, using Baggeridge brick cobblestones arranged in geometric patterns to evoke corn circles.   &lt;br />
