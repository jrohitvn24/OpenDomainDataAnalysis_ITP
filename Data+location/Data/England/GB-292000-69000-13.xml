		<title>13    THE ROADS OF SHALDON</title>
		<content>  The roads in Shaldon used to be just 
dirt tracks until they were Mac-       
adarnized from 1910-1920. Today traffic
between Shaldon and Torquay travels a- 
long the New Torquay Road. In the past 
horses and carts had to travel along   
the Old Torquay Road which is very     
steep and narrow and is now in a bad   
condition. At one point a lane leads   
off it and branches into 2 lanes -     
Milan Lane and Butterfly Lane. Butter- 
fly Lane is in a better condition than 
Milan Lane but neither is in a very    
good condition.                        
  Other lanes in the area include Brook
Lane, Lambert Lane and Laurel Lane, the
latter is known locally as "The Big    
Dipper".                               
  Thin winding lanes are typical of the
area and when the tide is high the     
lower lanes are often fooded.
