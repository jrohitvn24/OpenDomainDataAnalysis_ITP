		<title>09New look for old houses.</title>
		<content> When less labour was needed on        
 farms,some families moved into town   
 and their homes became delapidated and
 beyond the scope of local wages to buy
 or repair.Now many people from towns  
 are buying and renovating the old     
 houses.Often two terraced houses      
 become one well planned family        
 home.Some areas of farmland near      
 villages have been used for small new 
 developments.Infilling has made       
 village streets look more complete    
 particularly in Kington Magna.The old 
 village school has become two  unusual
 homes while the large rectory is now  
 owned by a large dairy concern        
 producing milk,cream and yoghurt under
 the name Old Rectory Farm. The name of
 a nearby new bungalow,Godwins Orchard 
 shows its site origin.
