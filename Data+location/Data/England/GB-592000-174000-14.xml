 privately owned amusement arcades,    
 snooker clubs, discotheques and bingo.
 They are located either on the sea    
 front or near the town centre.        
      There are two{amusement arcades  
 by the sea whose facilites include    
 video games, bingo and pinball        
 machines. They also sell ice cream and
 have a snack bar.                     
      Opposite these is one of the two 
 snooker clubs. Both are for members   
 only and are open throughout the year.
      The second snooker club is part  
 of the{entertainments}complex which   
 includes a cinema and{discotheque.}The
 latter caters for both locals and     
 seamen.                               
      The large bingo hall is housed in
 a converted cinema. It is open        
 nightly.                              </content>
