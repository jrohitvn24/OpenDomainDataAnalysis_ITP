		<title>16THE RECTOR OF STISTED</title>
		<content> The Reverend George Muggleton has been
 Rector of Stisted for seventeen years.
 His parish consists of Stisted,Brad-  
 well and Pattiswick.The church at     
 Pattiswick became redundant and is to 
 be sold.He holds two services most    
 Sundays in Stisted and one in         
 Bradwell.Congregations are very       
 small,with the largest at about 20,and
 he carries out only 3 or 4 weddings   
 and baptisms and 8 to 10 funerals each
 year.He does not agree with the       
 baptism of the children of non-       
 churchgoers.The churches are old and  
 kept locked.Three times in the past 20
 years thieves have tried to strip     
 Stisted church roof of lead.          
{*}The rector teaches Church history in
 the local church-aided primary school 
 (where he is Chairman of the          
 Governors) and has the biggest        
 Mothers'Union in the area.            </content>
