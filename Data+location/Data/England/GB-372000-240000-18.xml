		<title>18Aerobics in Colwall</title>
		<content>  "Why don't you start a class in      
 Colwall - I'd come!"                  
  Thus, since April 1984, Monday nights
 have seen Colwall ladies donning      
 leotards and tights, and the Park     
 Hotel reverberating to the sounds of  
 'Disco' music.                        
  The motivation for joining the class 
 varies. Some wish to lose weight,     
 others to keep fit, for some the post 
 work-out drink and chat at the bar at 
 the hotel is reward enough.           
  The faithful (some might call them   
 the mad) turn out in all weathers to  
 "fight the flab" in the really        
 health-conscious Eighties, and all    
 are united in the opinion that even   
 when feeling dull and listless after a
 gruelling hour of jog, sweat and      
 stretch, they feel thoroughly         
 refreshed and full of vitality.
