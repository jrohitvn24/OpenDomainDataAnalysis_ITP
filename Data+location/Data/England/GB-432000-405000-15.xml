 All kinds of goods can be bought in   
 the market - food, clothes, footwear, 
 carpets, jewellery, materials - in    
 fact almost anything! There is also an
 area which sells second-hand clothes  
 and is called locally the "Rag and    
 Louse".                               
                                       
  Barnsley Market is known throughout  
 South Yorkshire as a place to visit in
 search of a bargain.But local people  
 accept it as a very ordinary part of  
 their everyday way of life.Market     
 days bring people from outlying       
 districts into the town.Old people,   
 teenagers, Mums with their children,  
 all enjoy the bustle and lively       
 atmosphere of the town on market days.
