		<content>    Many different games are played in 
 our school playground such as Hide and
 Seek, Red-Rover, Donkey and Cat and   
 Mouse.   Many of the games require one
 player to be chosen to be "it" or     
 "on".   For instance in Hide nd Seek, 
 the player who "seeks" is "on" or     
 "it".  A "dipping" rhyme is used to   
 choose the player to be "on" or "it". 
  Skipping is also very popular in the 
 playground and again a rhyme is nearly
 always used to accompany the skipping.
   Below are some of the rhymes used in
 our playground.                       
            {                          
{            Dipping                   
     {                                 
{          Dip dip do                  
          {The cat's got flu           
{          The dog's got chicken pox   
          {And out goes you!
