		<content> The{hurdle maker}buys the rights to   
 coppice areas of woodland. He cuts    
 hazel in winter &amp; in May the bushes   
 shoot new growth. A bush left 7 years 
 gives  25 dozen/acre hurdles, left l0 
 years 40 dozen, longer &amp; the bushes   
 deteriorate. He makes hurdles in the  
 woods, twisting split hazel rods      
 intricately around. Each 4 ft. hurdle 
 takes 3/4 hour to make, selling for   
 Â£8, lasting about l0 years, mainly    
 used for racecourse jumps &amp; gardens.
