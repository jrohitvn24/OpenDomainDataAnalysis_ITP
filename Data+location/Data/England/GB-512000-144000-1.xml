 This land is east of the ancient      
 village of Abinger in the Green Belt. 
 It is mostly wooded greensand hills,  
 which drain quickly but draw the mist 
 - there are few roads, but a vast     
 network of footpaths and bridlepaths, 
 beloved of ramblers.  There are three 
 working farms, three riding-stables,  
 with scattered houses and a few small 
 hamlets.  Many of the inhabitants are 
 commuters.                            
                                       
 Southward the land rises to Leith Hill
 Tower (out of the area).  A ridge runs
 southeast to the Plough Inn at        
 Coldharbour, with the springs of the  
 Pippbrook to the east and the         
 Tillingbourne to the west.  These last
 have been dammed to form the lake at }
