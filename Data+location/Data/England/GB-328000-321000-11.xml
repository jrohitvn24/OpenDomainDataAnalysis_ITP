		<title>11Poultry Farming</title>
		<content> The cages are 16 inches square, each ,
 one holding 4 chickens. The cages are 
 stacked in flats 4 storeys high. The  
 chickens have a pecking order,taking  
 it in turns to eat the seed. Opinions 
 vary about this type of factory       
 farming, but Mr Peck said the chickens
 would not lay eggs if they were not   
 happy!.                               
      The huts are made from stone and 
 brick which were ammunition shelters  
 during World War Two. The sheds are   
 cleaned out once a week. There is some
 smell and a few flies, but there are  
 very few complaints from neighbours.  
       The eggs are taken to the       
 sorting  department and you can  see  
 them on well known supermarket        
 shelves.
