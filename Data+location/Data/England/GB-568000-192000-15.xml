		<content> In Church Road, at Crays Hill, we met 
 an old man. He talked about the       
 history of his house and those around 
 him. His own house is semi_detached,  
 rebuilt with brick in 1930, after the 
 original ship_lap structure was blown 
 down. Only one of the original houses 
 which is fire damaged and derelict    
 remains today. The other was burnt    
 down. Some of the timbers from this   
 house are being used for fire_wood. He
 has recently been connected to        
 electricity but has no gas supply. He 
 is not on mains_drainage,so has a     
 cesspool in his garden.He likes the   
 country,it provides all his needs;    
 fruit from the hedgerows,vegetables   
 from his garden and wines from plums  
 and berries.The River Crouch floods   
 his garden in rainy weather and is    
 polluted from factories up_stream.
