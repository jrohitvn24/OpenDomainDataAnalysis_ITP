{    }The crops grown at Ulley Hall    
 farm are limited by the type of soil  
 that is available.A very thin layer of
 soil lies over Gritstone.This means   
 the farmer is unable to plough the    
 land.Preparation for planting must be 
 made by a disc harrow.                
      All the crops are grown on a     
 contract basis. This means that the   
 crops are often sold before they are  
 planted to local firms at a fixed     
 price.Wheat,barley,peas and oil seed  
 rape are grown on the farm.Much of the
 wheat is sold for pig food,the husks  
 left after grinding are called sharps 
 and sold as horse food.Inferior wheat 
 is sold for cattle food.Peas are sold 
 to Batchelors for freezing,drying or  
 canning.Pasta wheat has been grown for
 the first time as an experiment.      </content>
