		<title>07Milk Quota effects - Longnor</title>
		<content>                                       
     We interviewed a corn traveller   
at the Corn Merchant's in Longnor to   
see whether milk quotas have affected  
the sale of corn and other sundries.   
He said that last year corn sales were 
down, but this year they have levelled 
off because the quotas have not been   
reduced so much this year.             
                                       
     They are selling more milk        
replacer for beef calves but no extra  
beef nuts.  The sales of ewe, lamb and 
sheep nuts are up considerably.        
                                       
     The price of corn has not gone up 
partly because of the huge surplus of  
grain, in fact the price of feeding    
stuffs had gone down by 20 pounds per  
tonne.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
