		<content> We asked  the villagers to reply      
 anonymously to the question           
 "what are your feelings on Horseheath 
 as a place to live?"                  
 "Like all close communities, there are
 advantages and disadvantages. The     
 people generally are friendly, but    
 there is a little disharmony caused by
 an overlapping of interests in        
 confined persuits. It is a great pity 
 that the school closed, and instead of
 three pubs there is now only one."    
 "A very friendly atmosphere_ good mix 
 of people.Now there is a bypass young 
 families are moving in."              
 "we like it" "great""quiet &amp; friendly"
 "it lacks facilities for the young and
 the oversixties""too quiet, untidy"   
 "Newcomers act snobbish""Young locals 
 had to move out as strangers bought   
 cottages at exhorbitant prices, these 
 people have no interest in the place" </content>
