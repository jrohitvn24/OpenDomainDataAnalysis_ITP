		<title>10ECOLOGY - Cannock Chase SCC</title>
		<content> Staffordshire County Council manages  
3500 acres.It is open moorland covered 
in heather and bracken.They spray or   
burn the bracken to control it.Brocton 
Coppice is one of the few remaining    
areas of oak but there are some alders 
by the streams/pools and a lot of      
silver birch along roadsides.Some of   
the Wardens collect the acorns and sow 
them in pots to grow in a nursery.The  
animals would eat them if they didnt   
and there would be no oak trees.       
 There are 300/400 Red deer and Fallow 
deer with a few Muntjack.Many deer are 
killed in road accidents so only a few 
are culled to maintain a number balance
 There are only 15 Badger setts on the 
Chase.There are foxes and rabbits in   
high numbers,many grey squirrels and   
a few red which are being encouraged   
with nesting boxes.The Chase has       
kestrels and nightjars.(M.Clegg Age8)  </content>
