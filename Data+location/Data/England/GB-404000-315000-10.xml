		<title>10 A RUGELEY MINER AT LEA HALL</title>
		<content>                                       
My dad is a pit deputy. At 11.00pm.he  
collects his cap lamp, safety lamp and 
self-rescuer. The last two protect him 
from dangerous gases. Deputies deploy  
the workmen and take charge of work    
carried out underground, including all 
aspects of health and safety. The men  
are expected look out for faulty       
equipment  and natural dangers. By law 
the deputies have to write a report on 
all that happens during their shift.   
They report to the underground manager 
and the deputy going on the next       
shift, then it's shower and home for   
breakfast at 9.0am. Dad dislikes the   
constant dust, threat to health and    
safety and some-times finds the "man   
train" frightening He likes the        
friendly atmosphere and the fact that  
the weather doesn't affect  his job.   
His father and grandfather were miners.</content>
