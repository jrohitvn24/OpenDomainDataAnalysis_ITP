		<title>12FARMING IN THE AREA 2</title>
		<content> A movement book is kept by all farmers
 to enable the Misistry of Agriculture 
 veterinary surgeons to trace the      
 origin and destination of all         
 livestock movement in the event of any
 outbreak of a notifiable disease such 
 as anthrax or foot and mouth.         
 Pheasants are reared in large numbers 
 for organised shoots, which take place
 from October to the end of January,   
 attracting wealthy landowners and     
 businessmen from all over the country 
 (including some Royalty).             
 This year the Spring was reasonably   
 dry and warm which gave the crops a   
 good start but the summer was cold and
 wet, which made harvest late and      
 prolonged. Summer weather finally     
 arrived in October with temperatures  
 reaching record levels.
