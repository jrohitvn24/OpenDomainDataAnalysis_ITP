		<content>   The block can be split into two     
 natural areas. To the south and west  
 the land is mainly flat or undulating 
 while to the north and east there lies
 a series of low hills.                
   Towering over the village of        
 Penshaw and the rest of the block is  
 Penshaw Hill (136m) with the dominant 
 Monument to the first Earl of Durham  
 perched on top. The hill forms the    
 western edge of the East Durham       
{Permian Escarpment,}a low plateau of  
 magnesium limestone which is also seen
 exposed at Hastings Hill (124m) and   
 Herrington Hill. At these three sites 
 the limestone has in the past been    
 quarried forming sites of natural     
 intrest.                              
   Underlying the limestone and forming
 the low plain to the west can be found
{Carboniferous Coalmeasures}providing  
 the coal that gave the NE its wealth. </content>
