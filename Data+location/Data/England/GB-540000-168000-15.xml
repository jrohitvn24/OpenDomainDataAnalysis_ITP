		<title>15Chislehurst Caves</title>
		<content>  Although known as Chislehurst Caves  
these are a series of old mines        
consisting of a 22 mile length of      
arched chalk passages.The passages are 
from 7ft to 12ft high and 6ft to 10ft  
wide and a section is open to the      
public.                                
                                       
The chalk was probably used as the     
foundations for buildings or roads,for 
lime smelting and may have been carried
back to Newcastle as ballast in the    
sailing barges that had brought coal to
the Thames ports.                      
                                       
The history of the mines is uncertain  
but it is claimed they were used by the
Druids, the Romans and the Anglo-Saxson
farmers for religious ceremonies and as
hiding places.They were used as an     
ammunition store in the 1st World War  
and as an air raid shelter in the 2nd. </content>
