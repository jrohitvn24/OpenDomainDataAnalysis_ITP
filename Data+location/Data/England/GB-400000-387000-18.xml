		<title>18HAYFIELD SCHOOL,HAYFIELD.</title>
		<content> Hayfield County Primary School is a   
 split-site School. The new building,  
 in which the infants are housed,was   
 opened in 1978,and is due to be       
 extended in 1985. When the new part is
 opened,all the school will be finally 
 on one site again.                    
 The old building,which is situated in 
 the heart of the village,was built in 
 1888 of Yorkshire Best stone from the 
 now disused Offerwell Quarry in       
 Hayfield.It has a veranda, built 40   
 years ago. When it first opened,the   
 school was divided up into boys and   
 girls.You can still see where the     
 ralings were to seperate then.We are  
 looking forward to moving into the New
 building because we will have a       
 hall/gym,showers and a canteen.It will
 be nice to be one big school          
 again,instead of being split up .
