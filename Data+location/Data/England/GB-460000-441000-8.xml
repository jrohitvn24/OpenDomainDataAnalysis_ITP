		<title>08A day in my life,by Melanie</title>
		<content> It's 6.45 a.m. and I've just been     
 woken up by my Dad's alarm.I get      
 dressed into my uniform,then I brush  
 my hair and put it into a ponytail.   
 When I've had my breakfast of toast   
 and marmalade I let Barney our dog    
 outside.I also go outside to feed the 
 animals.When I come back in I brush my
 teeth and get washed. At 8.20 a.m. my 
 Dad takes me to school,where we play  
 until the bell goes.Now it's time for 
 assembly,at which we sing a hymn and  
 say a prayer.We then go into our      
 classroom and work at Maths, English, 
 French,Geography,History,Science or   
 Art.In between Maths and English we   
 have a break,then it's lunch.After    
 lunch,more lessons,which last until   
 4.00 p.m.After tea we have prep until 
 5.00 p.m. which is when I go home.At  
 home I get changed and I play for a   
 while,watch T.V. and go to bed at 8.30</content>
