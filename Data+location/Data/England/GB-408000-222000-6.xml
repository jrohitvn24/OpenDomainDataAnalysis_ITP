		<content>    We have a police-station in the    
 village, and the policeman is a member
 of the Gloucestershire Police Force.  
    He visits the school and talks     
 about road safety,and helps train     
 cyclists for their National Cycling   
 Proficiency Badges.                   
    His helmet is made of cork and     
 fibre glass.He wears his army medals  
 on important occasions because he was 
 in the army before he became a        
 policeman seven years ago.            
    The equipment that a policeman     
 carries includes staff,notebook,pen,  
 watch,handcuffs and whistle. In big   
 cities they carry guns. He also has a 
 radio which is tuned to police        
 frequency.                            
    The nearest dog-handling squad is  
 in Cheltenham.
