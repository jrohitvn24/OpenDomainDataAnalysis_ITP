		<title>03Ilmer</title>
		<content> Ilmer is a small beautiful hamlet     
 where the gateways of several large   
 farms grouped round a triangular green
 near the church make the centre.      
 There are about 26 houses and some 70 
 people.  Most of the houses are large 
 with gardens and ponds.  Eight of the 
 men of the families here earn their   
 living on the three farms.   The      
 oldest farm house has a moat, not     
 round the house, but round an island, 
 made in times past so that the cattle 
 could be kept entirely surrounded by  
 water. The farm house has been        
 extended three times and a wide right 
 of way runs past the front door,      
 giving a hint of a once well travelled
 path. Ilmer is a backwater now, but   
 had a more important past when it was 
 a town, until like other places in the
 area, it was decimated by the black   
 death.                                </content>
