 Local people are saddened by, but     
accept as inevitable the fact that the 
empty farm cottages are being converted
to weekend homes.                      
 There is no pressure for a new bridge 
to ease the traffic flow but there is a
desire for better road signs to warn   
approaching lorries of the restrictions
on the bridges. By the time drivers are
aware of the problems there is         
insufficient room for manoeuvring.     
 One farmer's enthusiasm for           
conservation is slowly rubbing off onto
others. He is willing to accomodate    
people of all interests on his land    
even though he may be of a different   
persuasion. He is not a hunter but     
allows huntsmen to use his land.       
Ramblers are welcome providing they use
the correct footpaths, follow the      
country code and show common courtesy. </content>
