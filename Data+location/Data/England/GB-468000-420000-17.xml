 Over 90 years ago it started off as a 
 reading club.  It was just 1 house and
 a wooden shed at the back.  It started
 as a brick building in place of the   
 wooden shed in the mid 1950s.  In 1970
 another house was built and the club  
 was rebuilt to its present size. From 
 the first days the price of beer has  
 risen from 1.5p to the present price  
 of 64p per pint. The club is used for 
 recreation in darts, dominoes, cards  
 and many other things.
