		<title>01North Marston Village &amp; Farm</title>
		<content> The village of North Marston dominates
 the area.   It is perched on a knoll  
 some 400ft above sea level overlooking
 the surrounding lowlying and poorly   
 drained grazing land.   As its name   
 indicates the area would have been    
 marshland origionally and even today  
 is liable to extensive flooding.      
 Farming is this confined largely to   
 the grazing of old permanent pastures.
 Population is about 700 persons  and  
 increasing steadily as new housing    
 development takes place.   Several    
 farms are situated in the village in  
 the old English style.   Once a       
 completely agrarian ecconomy the      
 majority of the inhabitants now       
 commute to the local towns for work   
 and recreation.   The village first   
 (primary) school caters for several   
 surrounding villages after which      
 children move to Whitchurch &amp; Winslow </content>
