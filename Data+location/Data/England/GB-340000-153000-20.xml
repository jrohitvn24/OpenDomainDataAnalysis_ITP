		<content> My{playschool}was a small one, run    
 from the woman's own house. We all    
 used to like playing on the slide and 
 climbing frame best but we had a lego 
 table and a plasticine table.   Lego  
 are bricks which snap together to     
 build different shapes in bright      
 colours. Plasticine is a sort of toy  
 clay. We also had easy to read        
 ladybird books and a mini, indoor     
 see-saw. At 4 - 5 years old I left    
{playschool}to go to{ Primary School   
 where we played with toys less        
 and learned to read, write and use our
 imaginations.  At 9 years old I moved 
 on to{Fairlands Middle School.}This   
 school is really a continuation of the
 Primary School. Finally this September
 I leave to go to the{Kings of Wessex. 
 Here I will take my GCSE which        
 involves taking exams to get grades   
 for qualifications to get a good job. </content>
