		<content>  St. Andrew's Church was originally   
built of flint. The Church and school  
were destroyed by a doodle-bug in 1943.
The church was rebuilt in a similar    
style, but rendered in concrete. The   
school re-opened elsewhere in the      
village in 1973. In the Church, there  
are stained-glass windows and a sermon-
glass. A new organ was installed in    
1982. The bell is housed in the tower  
which now needs repairing. The Rector  
is shared with other Churches. On      
Wednesdays after school, children from 
Chelmondiston and Harkstead meet with  
the Rector for Children's Church. We   
draw and paint and do a variety of     
other things. At the moment our project
is photography. We photograph each     
other and develop the films in a dark  
room. It is good fun and we look       
forward to it every week.
