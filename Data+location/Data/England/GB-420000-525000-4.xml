  I am 10 years old and attend{All}    
{Saints' School}in Shildon.My hospital 
 is 6 kilometres away in{Bishop}       
{Auckland}which is the nearest large   
 town to Shildon.I started to go to the
 hospital when I was a couple of months
 old for check-ups as I have a heart   
 murmur.I used to be weighed and have  
 my height checked at the{General}     
{Hospital}each month. I was about 3    
 when I stopped going.Then I started to
 get colds every fortnight so I went to
 the local GP.He told me that I had    
 paler hands than normal and that I    
 would have to go into the General     
 Hospital for tests for anaemia.That   
 was when they found that I had a heart
 complaint.They gave me treatment and  
 now I am much better.I can play and   
 take part in sport at school and go   
 swimming with the rest of the class.  </content>
