		<content>  The Catherine Ward Hall was opened in
 January 1970 as sheltered             
 accommodation for old people.There is 
 a resident warden in attendance.This  
 lady has been working here for eight  
 and a half years.                     
  There are 28 men and women living    
 here at present.They each have their  
 own flat fitted with a kitchen, where 
 they may cook their own meals.Those   
 unable to prepare their own food have 
 meals cooked for them.                
  There is a large Day Room/Lounge area
 where the old people may meet and talk
 during the day.This room is used for  
 entertainments such as T.V.,bingo and 
 dominoes.The room is equipped with    
 large armchairs and tables.           
  Outings are organised in the summer.

 least three years and said they       
 enjoyed it.                           </content>
