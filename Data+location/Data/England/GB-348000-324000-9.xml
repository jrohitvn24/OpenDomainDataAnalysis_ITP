		<title>09Transport Survey</title>
		<content> A Survey was undertaken amongst the   
 residents of Clive who were asked to  
 describe what mode of transport they  
 used to travel.  Most households owned
 a{car}and many owned more than one,   
 the exceptions being amongst the older
 residents.  Cars were used for        
 journeys to work, for shopping,       
 entertainment, sports, taking children
 to school and the like.  There is one 
{bus service}which stops at Clive 3    
 times a day on its way from           
 Shrewsbury to Wem.  A{train service   
 operates from Shrewsbury to Crewe and 
 stops infrequently at Wem and Yorton  
 which is about half a mile from Clive 
 and outside this D block.             
 Motor bikes , mopeds and bicycles are 
 used mostly by the younger members of 
 the community for travelling around   
 the local area.
