TELEVISION In nearly every home the TV 
has taken the place of the fireplace,  
with furniture turned toward it.  Pro- 
grammes are on all day, but it is after
school and evening, when it takes over 
life for some families.  There are four
channels plus CEFAX and Oracle for up  
to date information.  BBC 1 and 2 are  
nationwide, whereas commercial channels
vary - here we pick up Anglia.  Many   
programmes are bought from the USA,    
they are popular, but the best quality 
work is home-produced - wild life,     
documentary, investigatory and comedy  
series attract a big audience.         
READING MATERIAL  Most read newspapers 
are The Sun', Daily Mirror' and      
Daily Telegraph'.  Homes get 2 free   
local papers and buy The Advertise'.  
Books are borrowed from libraries      
rather than bought - other than childs.</content>
