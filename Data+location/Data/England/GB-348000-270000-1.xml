 a broad valley of River Teme which    
 flows south. It is highest on High

 by A49 trunk road and railway. Just   
 off this road there is a small village
 with its church still in use.Ashford  
 Bowdler. The village of Richard's     
 Castle is somewhat elongated along two
 lanes and in the block there is a     
 church in use, no shop, a primary     
 school now closed anddd a second      
 church, above, little use near two    
 farms and some timbered cottages.

 grounds and some bungalows. A quarter 
 of the area is forest and the farming 
 is mainly sheep andd cattle
