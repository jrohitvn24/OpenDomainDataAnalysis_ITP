		<content>       Kemp Town is composed of Sussex 
 Square, Lewes Crescent &amp; Chichester/  
 Arundel Terraces which are all Grade  
 One Listed, begun in 1823 to the      
 design of Wilds &amp; Bushy by Thomas Reid
 Kemp. The terraces surrounded an open 
 area of private gardens. There are    
 very few whole houses left, the       
 majority having been{subdivided}into  
 flats with prices varying from Â£70,000
 to Â£150,000.                          
       There are several other squares 
 &amp; crescents in the area though all are
 much smaller &amp; many have been recently
 rebuilt rather badly, others have     
 become hotels. Some places such as    
 Royal Crescent (1798-1807 Grade II)   
 still maintain their original         
 appearence faced with mathematical    
 tiles. Other places such as Portland  
 Place are Grade II and many have      
 become guest houses.                  </content>
