		<title>20KING'S PARK CEMETERY</title>
		<content> In King's Park cemetery at one end are
 the Jewish people and at the other    
 Christians.  There is a big square in 
 the centre with a hedge around it and 
 sixty-four grave stones inside, but   
 because these are soldiers who died in
 the First and Second World Wars there 
 might not be any bodies. There are    
 nine people to look after the         
 grave-stones.  The cemetery and church
 were built in 1896, two years before  
 the first person, Jean Jacques, was   
 buried there.  His grave-stone is an  
 ivory cross with Jesus on. The person 
 who was buried there most recently was
 Elsie Erwin who was buried on Tuesday,
 25 June 1985.  All around are crosses,
 arches, hearts and angels which cost a
 lot of money.  After about ninety to a
 hundred years they are dug up and     
 someone else is buried there.
