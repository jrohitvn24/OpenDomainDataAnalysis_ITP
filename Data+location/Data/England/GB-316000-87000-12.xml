		<title>12THE DONKEY SANCTUARY.</title>
		<content> The Donkey Sanctuary at Slade Farm is 
 owned by Mrs Svendson. Over two       
 thousand donkeys have been in its care
 but most move on to one of the other  
 farms owned by Mrs Svendson. At the   
 moment there are 176 donkeys at Slade 
 Farm. Over 70 people are employed over
 all the farms. There is a hospital for
 the donkeys and a resident vetinary   
 surgeon. Many of the donkeys are in a 
 poor state of health when they arrive.
 Some donkeys are used in The Slade    
 Centre to give rides to handicapped   
 children, who are brought to the      
 Centre by a special ambulance coach,  
 owned by the Centre. The children ride
 in carts or on the donkeys and enjoy  
 stroking the donkeys. There are other 
 activities for them to do and they    
 have lunch at the Centre. The Centre  
 has specially trained staff for the   
 children.                             </content>
