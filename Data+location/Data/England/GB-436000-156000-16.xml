		<title>16SYSTEMS OF COMMUNICATION</title>
		<content> Linkenholt has its own Post Office and
 Telephone Box, but there are very few 
 houses with their own private         
 telephone. In Faccombe every house has
 its own telephone but there is no Post
 Office or Telephone Box. There is a   
 post box for letters in the wall of   
 the Manor Gardens. Most houses in     
 Netherton have a telephone. The whole 
 area has 2 postal collections and     
 deliveries each day. Citizens' Band   
 radios are used on the farms as       
 convenient communication between      
 workers spread over large areas to    
 give directions regarding work or to  
 call for help in case of emergency.   
 CB radios assisted the apprehension of
 sheep rustlers and poachers recently.
