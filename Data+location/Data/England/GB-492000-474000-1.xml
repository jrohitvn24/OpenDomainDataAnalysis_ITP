		<content> An area of Farmland, intensively

 abruptly to escarpment or Yorkshire   
 Wolds. Crops are sugar beet, potatoes,
 wheat, barley oil seed rape. Kale and 
 turnips for sheep grazing. Small      
 village of East Heslerton stands on   
 A64 Leeds to Scarborough. Which also  
 cuts across Sherburn Village. About 10
 farms on area. The soil on upland     
 plateau can be very thin and lots of  
 chalk and flints. The Wolds are noted 
 for good malting barley. 6 small      
 shelter belt woods mainly broad leaved
 around farm steadings. One other minor
 road from north to south. General     
 aspect of rolling wolds of large      
 cultivated fields broken by clumps of 
 farm steads surrounded by shelter     
 belts.                                </content>
