		<content>{Hotels and Public Houses              
 As might be expected in a tourist area
 there is a wide variety of hotels and 
 public houses in the area. The most   
 prestigious is the 4 star Bedford Arms
 which was originally a Georgian       
 coaching inn and now provides         
 accommodation for businessmen during  
 the week as well as for tourists.     
 While providing a tourist amenity     
 during the day the pubs and hotels are
 popular with the local population and 
 make Woburn the centre for dining in  
 the area. Most inns and hotels in the 
 area provide food ranging from snacks 
 to full meals and most have gardens   
 or courtyards for summer use. The     
 Birchmore Arms also provides          
 accommodation and has a Sunday disco. 
 Other pubs include the Black Horse -  
 mentioned in the Good Beer Guide, the 
 Bell and The Magpie.                  </content>
