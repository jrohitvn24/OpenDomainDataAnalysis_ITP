		<title>08DISUSED MINES DUKINFIELD</title>
		<content> In the Nineteenth Century Dukinfield  
 was a mining village where houses had 
 been built for the mining families.   
 However,'{Dewsnap Deeps'}were         
 eventually closed down and the waste  
 coal was covered over with earth.     
 Houses and schools were built on top  
 of the old mines but there was always 
 the worry of gas seeping up into      
 buildings from beneath the ground.    
 When there was heavy rainfall the gas 
 was pushed up out of the ground,making
 for a hazardous situation.            
 Consequently,when {All Saint's High   
{School'}was built over the site of one
 of these mines it was thought         
 necessary to install sensitive alarms 
 to detect any such leakage which are  
 monitored by a computer. If there is a
 build up of gas the school has to be  
 evacuated and the fire brigade called 
 in to disperse it.                    </content>
