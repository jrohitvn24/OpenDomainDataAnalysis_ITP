		<title>05A day at Whisstock's boaty'd</title>
		<content>   Mr Whisstock starts work at 8.00am  
 and has a walk around to make sure the
 boatyard is all right. Then he goes   
 into his office and reads the mail. He
 often gets mail in foreign languages. 
 Mr whisstock designs and makes        
 pleasure boats. First he has to draw a
 picture of the boat before he and his 
 team can make it. He has a long job   
 working out how much the boat costs.  
 It usually costs between Â£100,000 and 
 Â£400,000. Most boats take about two   
 months to make. The boatyard makes    
 about six boats a year. After the boat
 is made Mr whisstock and his employees
 fit a fridge,a toilet and other things
 like that inside the boat to furnish  
 it.
