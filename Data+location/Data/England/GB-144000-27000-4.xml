		<content> "Hevva was the cry of the huers who   
 spotted and singalled the huge shoals 
 of fish, especially pilchards.        
 The term'heavy cake' still commonly   
 used is derived from the word hevva'. 
 Hevva also meant a description of     
 crowd bustle or excitment as when some
 special event had roused the interest 
 of the community"a brag' ol'hevva on  
 the pier".                            
 Fishermen would gather on the'gow'a   
 place of talk, or the name for a crowd
 of men chatting.                      
 Woe betide any youngster who butted   
 in he would probably receive a        
 corrective 'Scat aross the chaks"to   
 put him in his place.
