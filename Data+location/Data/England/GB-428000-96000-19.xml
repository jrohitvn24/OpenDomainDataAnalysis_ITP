		<content>  4 mills have been turned into houses 
 and many farms cater for tourists or  
 are mere hobbies not subsistence      
 farming. There are many old cob       
 cottages which have been modernised,  
 making very fashionable dwellings.    
  A look at the baptism and burial     
 registers shows that people are living
 longer and in this area fewer young   
 families are finding it expedient to  
 stay. Expensive housing, a village    
 school several miles distant, shopping
 a good journey away either in New     
 Milton or Lymington prove powerful    
 deterrents to young married couples.  
  The baptism register 1839-1841       
 records the occupations of the fathers
 as follows- 1 blacksmith, 1 shoemaker,
 43 labourers,1 gipsy, 1 painter and 1 
 dairyman.
