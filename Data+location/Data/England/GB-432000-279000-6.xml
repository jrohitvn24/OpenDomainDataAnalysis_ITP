		<title>06A day in my life</title>
		<content> I am nine years old and I live in     
 Coventry. A typical school day for me 
 would be to get up at 6.45. I have    
 breakfast of Kelloggs Corn Flakes,    
 toast and a cup of tea. Next I get    
 ready for school. I walk to school    
 with my mum, my brother Nathaniel and 
 two sisters Bethan &amp; Erin. School     
 starts at 8.55. I spend the morning   
 doing number &amp; English. We have school
 dinner at 12.OO &amp; then spend an hour  
 in the playground. I play 'Headers' &amp; 
 volleyball with my friend Dean. During
 the afternoon we do Art or Topic &amp; go 
 home at 3.35. After school I help my  
 mum and sometime watch television. We 
 have tea at 6.OO. Next I get ready for
 bed. I go to bed at 7.OO &amp; read until 
 7.3O &amp; then I go to sleep.            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
