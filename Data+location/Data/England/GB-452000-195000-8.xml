		<title>08WOODLANDS, CLIFTON HAMPDEN</title>
		<content>   A  large  part  of the  land  in the
 north  eastern  part  of this  area is
 covered by  woodlands. The  woodlands,
 which  are  part  of the  Nuneham Park
 estate,are managed as such. Originally
 these were  primarily mixed  plantings
 of oak, ash, cherry and chestnut.     
 Modern  replanting  is of  conifer and
 hardwood in a ratio of about 2:1.     
   Clifton Heath used to be  mostly oak
 woodland, but much of this  was felled
 during  World War II, and  it  is  now
 mainly  birch  with  a little oak  and
 cherry.                               
   Woodland  edge  plants  such  as    
 bluebells, primroses  and red  campion
 abound in the newer plantations. Broad
 leaved  helleborines  and  honeysuckle
 may also  be found and, in the autumn,
 various  types  of  fungi,  including 
 mushrooms,  can  be  seen  along  the 
 verges of the woods.                  </content>
