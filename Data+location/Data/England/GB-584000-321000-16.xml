		<title>16OLD PEOPLES SHELTERED HOMES</title>
		<content> In Weasenham St Peter there are 8     
 flatlets and 8 bungalows owned by the 
 Breckland District Council which are  
 lived in by elderly people who are in 
 the care of a warden and deputy.The   
 warden calls every morning to check   
 that the people are well and does any 
 shopping or pension collecting if     
 needed. The local shopkeeper delivers 
 groceries and the village delivery    
 vans call at the sheltered homes. The 
 doctor from Litcham calls on Mondays  
 and the one from Massingham visits on 
 Fridays. The Vicar takes a special    
 Holy Communion Service once a month.  
 There is a community room and once a  
 fortnight games such as bingo and     
 whist are arranged. An "Age Concern"  
 minibus runs to and from Fakenham on a
 Thursday and can be hired for special 
 trips if wanted.
