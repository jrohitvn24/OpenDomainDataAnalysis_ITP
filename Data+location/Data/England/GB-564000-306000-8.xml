{Play Group:}This meets three times a  
 week, in the Village Hall, during term
 time. There are a large number of     
 under fives attending and much effort 
 has gone into providing equipment. The
 children spend most of their time in  
 supervised play.                      
                                       
{Bowls Club:}Shouldham boasts a large  
 and successful club which plays in    
 many of the local and county leagues. 
 A new Club house was built three years

 facilities. Many members come from the
 surrounding area and this is one of   
 the best known clubs in the area.
