		<content> Unfortunately there is far too much   
 unemployment in the area.Most people  
 who do work go into Leicester and are 
 employed in hosiery,knitwear,shoe-    
 making,light engineering or service   
 industries.Local jobs are in farming, 
 nursery gardens,garages,shops and     
 education.Schools and the Polytechnic 
 provide employment for ancilliary     
 workers as well as teachers and       
 lecturers.                            
 Many young people are finding it very 
 difficult to find a job when they     
 leave school and this is some times   
 blamed for the trouble and vandalism  
 which is common especially on council 
 estates.
