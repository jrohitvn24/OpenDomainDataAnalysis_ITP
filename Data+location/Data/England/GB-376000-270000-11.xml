		<title>11Camping at Coney Green Farm</title>
		<content>                                       
  During the Whitsun holiday I went    
 to Coney Green Farm with the Cubs     
 for a camping trip. At the farm there 
 is a wide green for caravans and      
 tents. There are goats,sheep, ducks,  
 a few cows,geese and other farm       
 animals.                              
  There is a stream nearby, called the 
 Gladderbrook,which goes to the River  
 Severn.It is very deep and goes past  
 my head.The owners of the farm are MR 
 and MRS Gould.                        
   At  Cubs I did 2 badges and some map
 reading.The first badge was exploring.
 We went into the wood by the green.   
 There were a lot of tracks to walk    
 along.                                
 We also made a den with wood and fern 
 leaves.The other badge was campers and
 we made a wooden washing-up stand.
