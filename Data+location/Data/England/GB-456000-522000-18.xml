		<title>18RED BARNS</title>
		<content>  One of the oldest and most           
 interesting houses in my area is "Red 
 Barns." It was built for Thomas Hugh  
 Bell,an ironmaster,in 1871. It was    
 there that Gertrude Lowthian Bell,the 
 Arabian explorer, spent her childhood.
  After graduating from Oxford she went
 to the Middle East,where she took a   
 leading part in the administrative    
 development of Iraq.                  
  After the First World War she        
 assisted Lawrence of Arabia by doing  
 propaganda work and became known as   
 Mother of the Faithful.               
  When she died,she was given the      
 funneral of a shiehk.                 
  In 1920s "Red Barns" was sold and    
 became the house where the headmaster 
 and the borders of Sir William        
 Turner's Grammar School lived until   
 1975 when the school closed.The house 
 was sold and became a private hotel.  </content>
