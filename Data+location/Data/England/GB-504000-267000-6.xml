		<title>06Population of Dean</title>
		<content> At the last census in 1981, the       
 population of Dean with Shelton was   
 317 in 110 households. This was made  
 up of 69 people under 16 years of age 
 and 48 of pensionable age (for males  
 over 65 and females over 60)          
 Only 17 households were without a car.
 There is only 1 household in Lower    
 Dean whose residents have always lived
 in Dean, whereas there are several    
 families in Upper Dean who have always
 lived in the village.                 
 There is now quite a large percentage 
 of the population, especially in Lower
 Dean, who have moved here from other  
 parts of the country and who will     
 probably move on with their work.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
