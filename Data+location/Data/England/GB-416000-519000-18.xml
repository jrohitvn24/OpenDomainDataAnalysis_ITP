 Controlled School, is for Infants and 
 Juniors. The old school dated back    
 from{1816}and was on the north side of
 the village. It was replaced by a new 
 school on the south side of the       
 village in{1967}.The new school has 3 
 classrooms and a hall facing south    
 with fine views over to the{Richmond  
{Hills}. The{sundial}, dated 1816, and 
 the{school bell}were brought from the 
 old school building.                  
    Today we have{53}children on the   
 school roll, they travel from the     
 outlying villages by school bus.Most  
 children stay at school for dinner    
 which is cooked on the premises by    
 Mrs.Priestly and Mrs.Thornton.        
{  }On Wednesday afternoon the children
