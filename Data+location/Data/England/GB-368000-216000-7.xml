		<title>07BLAISDON COMMUNITY LIFE.</title>
		<content> The annual parish meeting takes place 
 in April. Each year has a theme, 1985 
 was {SECURITY.}The village hall,a     
 dis-used school has recently been     
 modernized. It is used for most       
 village activities from W.I.to        
 aerobics. Blaisdon  also raises money 
 for charity. The{plum festival}raised 
 Â£2,000. There is a harvest sale       
 too. Public transport is limited to   
 one bus to Gloucester at 7.40 am      
 returning at 6.15 daily with an extra 
 one on Wednesdays.Luckily most people 
 in Blaisdon have a car.Milk is        
 delivered three times a week.There is 
 no village shop or Post Office. It is 
 interesting to see the contrast with  
 Longhope. Blaisdon was dependent on   
 the Hall. As a result it is now a     
 pretty village but lacks the economic 
 and commercial features of Longhope.
