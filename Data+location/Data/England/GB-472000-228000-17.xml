 The stream was quick-flowing and full 
of fish.We dipped for 45 minutes and   
caught or saw the following species of 
fish - stickleback,bullhead,minnow,    
chub,gudgeon &amp; loach.Dace is also known
to be there.The stream looked very     
healthy &amp; there were quieter slow      
moving spots for fish to hunt.There    
were plenty of insects.                
 We also saw 1 swan.
