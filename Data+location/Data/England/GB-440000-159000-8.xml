		<title>08The Post Office Stores</title>
		<content> The Post Office stores was built in   
 Woolton Hill in the early nineteenth  
 century. Before the Post Office opened
 there were two cottages. Mr.and Mrs   
 Toal bought the shop in 1975. Nearly  
 forty people have owned the shop      
 before Mr. and Mrs Toal.Some people   
 shop at the post office when they     
 forget provisions at Newbury but some 
 people without transport use the shop 
 regularly. About two hundred to three 
 hundred people come into the post     
 office stores each day for groceries  
 and stamps. Shop lifting is a problem 
 in the shop, it has existed for ten   
 years. Two people have been caught,   
 and they do know of others who have   
 not been prosecuted  yet.
