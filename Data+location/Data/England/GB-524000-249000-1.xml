		<title>01General Description.</title>
		<content> The area is rural and almost totally  
 devoted to farming activities. Its    
 position is somewhat remote being     
 served by only two minor roads off,   
 major routes but, the area is well    
 blessed with foot and bridle paths.   
     The underlying chalk and clay have
 influenced the farming type, much of  
 the area being a mix of the two, the  
 resulting lighter soil being ideal for
 both arable farming (mainly spring and
 winter wheat and oil seed rape) and   
 the raising of soft fruits and        
 orchards. These activities are found  
 on the higher parts where there is a  
 ridge. The lower areas are mostly     
 heavy clay and more suited to pastoral
 farming (mostly the fattening of beef 
 cattle). Several wooded areas occur   
 in the region, remnants of old forests
 that started life not long after the  
 last Ice Age.                         </content>
