		<title>17THATCHAM BOY'S MORNING.</title>
		<content>   I woke up at about five minutes to  
 seven feeling very much under the     
 weather. I decided to stay in bed and 
 miss school but it didn't work and I  
 had to go. I ate my breakfast (a bowl 
 of muesli and two slices of toast) and
 put on my school uniform which        
 consists of one white shirt,a         
 green and silver tie, a pair of grey  
 trousers, a pair of grey socks, a pair
 of black "beetle crushers" and a green
 jumper. The jumper bears the Francis  
 Baily badge. After this I brushed my  
 teeth and hair. I was nearly late for 
 school. The morning's work was mainly 
 tracing the path of the previous day's
 walk from Thatcham all the way to     
 Colthrop Mill and back. Then there was
 a graph about the length of reigns of 
 all the English monarchs from William 
 the Conqueror to Elizabeth II.        
   Lunchtime at last, five past twelve.</content>
