		<content> The rules of our church all came from 
 Jesus.You always have the choice of   
 whether you want to believe in Jesus  
 or not.In our church there are only   
 two basic rules one is to love your   
 neighbour the other is to love        
 God.There is a saying if you don't    
 obey rules you are like the man who   
 built his house on the sand, if you do
 you are like the man who built his    
 house on the rock.Jesus still calls   
 people to follow him to this very day.
 We still have  the choice to follow   
 him.In our church in olden days,      
 adults were baptized but now it is    
 mostly children and babies.           
{Church Services:A Wedding}            
 I have been a bridesmaid four times.  
 The best thing I like about it is     
 wearing those long dresses.I dont like
 going up the aisle because I go all   
 red in the face.                      </content>
