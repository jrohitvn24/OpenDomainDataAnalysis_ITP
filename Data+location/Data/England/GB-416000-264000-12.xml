		<content> When peoply hire the boats, they      
 normally hire them for a week. It's   
 normally families that hire these     
 boats, but sometimes couples will     
 hire them.                            
 People normally travel about 70 miles 
 in a week, but the distance they go   
 depends on how many locks they have to
 go through; on average there is one   
 lock to every mile.                   
 When hiring a boat, the price can vary
 enormously according to season, e.g.  
 4 man boat in March - Â£125            
             August  - Â£250            
 (Prices for one week).                
 Hire includes fuel, gas, British      
 Waterways Board licence charges,      
 bedding and car parking. Some         
 companies offer a discount if you hire
 for more than one week.
