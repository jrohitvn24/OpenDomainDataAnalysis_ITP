		<title>15BISHOPGARTH- POLICE TRAINING</title>
		<content> Bishopgarth was first built in 1891   
 for the Bishop to live in. In 1946 it 
 became the West Yorkshire Metropolitan
 Police Training School. The classrooms
 were built in 1952 and the new block  
 added in 1969. There are 14 courses   
 for training policemen and women      
 including courses in fingerprints,    
 computer training, firearms, public   
 speaking and traffic management.      
 Bishopgarth can take a maximum of 250 
 students at any one time and usually  
 there are 200 students staying there. 
 There are four special courses every  
 year for foreign students. At these   
 courses 48 students will attend. To be
 a policeman you must be 5'9\" tall and
 for a policewoman 5'6" tall. This is  
 the same as 166cm tall for a man and  
 154 cm tall for a woman.
