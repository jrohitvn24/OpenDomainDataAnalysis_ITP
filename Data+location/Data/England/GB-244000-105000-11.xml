		<content> There is a saddlery in Black          
 Torrington. The saddler begins with a 
 wooden frame called a tree. He covers 
 it with webbing and hessian. He       
 stretches a sheet of leather over it  
 and nails it underneath. He cuts out  
 flaps and skirts from hard butt       
 leather and fixes them to the tree. He
 makes a leather panel, stuffs it with 
 flock and stitches it underneath the  
 tree. He also makes bridles and reins 
 and repairs other leather goods.      
 There are two builders in the village.
 They undertake all types of work. One 
 employs  a carpenter, 2 masons, a     
 decorator and a labourer, and the     
 other just a mason and an apprentice. 
 One obtains his raw materials from    
 Tamar Trading in Holsworthy and the   
 other from Rawle, Gammon and Baker in 
 Bideford. They both use vans for      
 transport of men and materials.       </content>
