		<content> Mr. M. Trinnick has been the          
 church-warden of{Lanhydrock Church}   
 since 1960. In 1884 the church was    
 restored and today is in very good    
 order. Between {five and six thousand 
{pounds}is donated in the visitors'    
 box. This goes towards the upkeep of  
 the church and helps restore other    
 churches.{The National Trust}lookafter
 the grounds and heat the church. There
 is a service every Sunday morning with
 a congregation of aboout 25; for a    
 Communion it is over 30. Except for 2 
 people all are local. They have an old
 fashioned Prayer Book service         
 conducted by the Rev. Davis of        
 Lostwithiel. Great difficulty is      
 experienced in finding{priests}to man 
 rural parishes. In 1984 parishoners   
 raised Â£6,000 for a new{digital       
{computer organ}.
