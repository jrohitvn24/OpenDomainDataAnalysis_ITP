  At present planning permission has   
been granted by Staffordshire Health   
Authority to build a new Hospital in   
Cannock. The Hospital will be able to  
accommodate approximately 224 people   
(inpatients). There will also          
be a casualty and maternity block. The 
Hospital is due to be started in 1986  
and completed by 1990.                 
  Cannock is currently supplied by one 
Health Centre,&amp; the Chase Hospital     
which is primarily a geriatric unit.   
Provision for old people is available  
at Cannock Chase Community Hospital on 
the Wolverhampton Road.                
  There is an Ambulance Station        
adjoining the Chase Hospital, which    
serves the whole of Cannock area.
