		<title>09HEALTH IN THE SHREWLEY AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
The local doctor in Little Shrewley    
came out to visit the sick from        
Shrewley. The inhabitants of Little    
Shrewley had no complaints about the   
doctor,they thought he was marvellous. 
The doctor would write out the         
prescription at the house and then     
provide them with the medicine         
straight away.This saved the people    
having to travel to a chemist.         
                                       
The main doctors surgery was in Shrew- 
ley Common. Therefore Shrewley Common  
people lived within walking distance   
of the surgery.                        
                                       
If hospitals are needed locals go to   
Birmingham Hospital or Leamington      
and Warwick Hospital.Fortunately there 
are no specific illnesses that anyone  
in this area regularly suffers.        </content>
