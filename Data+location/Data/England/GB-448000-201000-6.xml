		<content>   For breakfast I enjoy fried egg   on
toast, fried potato and sausage, it is 
very filling. For lunch on a school day
I have cheese sandwiches, an apple, a  
chocolate bar and a carton of fruit    
juice. On a holiday I would have baked 
beans on toast and cheese and crackers.
For dinner I have a stew and a pie of  
some sort. I like to cook, we have     
cooking lessons at school, I like to   
make short-cake and other kinds of     
biscuits.                              
                                       
   I like cereals of all kinds,        
particularly corn flakes, rice crispies
and cocoa pops, sometimes I have bran  
flakes, my mum says fibre in my food is
good for me. I like fruit of all kinds,
my favourite is oranges.
