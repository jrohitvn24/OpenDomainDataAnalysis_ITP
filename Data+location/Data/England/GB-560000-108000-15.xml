		<content> An alternative type of housing        
 becoming increasingly popular in the  
 1980s are Park Homes due to the       
 continual rise in price of            
 conventional houses. They are sited on
 what were previously known as Caravan 
 Parks - areas of land licensed by     
 Local Authorities for this use. Lion  
 House Park which is situated on the   
 outskirts of Hailsham is a typical    
 example. This development of 112 Park 
 Homes has attracted folk from all     
 over the country wishing to retire to 
 Sussex. A condition of occupation is  
 that residents must be retired and no 
 pets are allowed. Park Home dwellers  
 form a very close knit community. At  
 Lion House they have a Club Room      
 where leisure activities abound. Each 
 day there is something organised,     
 Whist Drives, Bingo, Tea Dances etc.  
 where it is easy to make friends.     </content>
