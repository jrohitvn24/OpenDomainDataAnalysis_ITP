     {Good God} who's this coming down 
the road? {Is it an alien?} No, it's a 
{Hippi.}  {God,} we get some tourists  
these days!                            
                                       
     He was wearing a pair of shorts   
which showed his {fat, hairy} legs. He 
was {fat} and wobbling everywhere. His 
shoes didn't do any good for him, they 
had heels on them and they were        
pointed at the toes.  (The heels       
weren't all that high though.)  He     
looked as if he hadn't shaved for      
days.  He had a {long moustache} which 
{curled} at the ends. He {wobbled}     
past the kitchen window, then he       
{wobbled out of sight.}                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
