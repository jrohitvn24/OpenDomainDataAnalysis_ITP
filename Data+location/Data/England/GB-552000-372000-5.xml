 In November 1984 we moved into a new  
 school it was built a few hundred     
 yards from the old school.It is much  
 bigger than the old school and has a  
 lot more equipment.Instead of the     
 portable cabins being split up around 
 the school we are all under one roof  
 in the new one.One of the good points 
 about the new school is that we have  
 much more room to work and play in.The
 juniors are at one end of the school  
 with a corrider and a hall seperating 
 us from the infants.The old learner   
 swimming pool is being moved and is   
 now being re-erected.A brick wall is  
 being built by Manpower Services.
