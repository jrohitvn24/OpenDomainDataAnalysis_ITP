		<content>{   Street and Place Names}give us an  
 insight into the{history of Windsor.  
 Dedworth(Dideorde) and Clewer         
 (Clivore) are ancient areas of        
 Windsor.{Spital}is a Medieval name for
 the area near the Leper{hospital}of   
 St. Peters. Goswell is derived from   
 the goose stream and meadow.          
    Street names give a wealth of clues
 about the past. For example{Peascod   
{street}led to the Peas croft (field). 
 Sheet street was beside a field called
 Sheet. Most Windsor streets are modern
 and refer to the original site.       
    Other street names remind us of    
{landowners}or{famous residents.       
 Testwood,Pierson and Fulmer were the  
 Windsor Martyrs'. Galley, Carey,      
 Keppel and Barry were M.P.'s; whilst  
 Bolton, Bulkley, Dyson, Ellison, Camm 
 and Luff were well known residents.
