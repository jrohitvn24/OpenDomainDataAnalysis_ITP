		<title>12BASWICH-A TYPICAL SUBURB?</title>
		<content>The class conducted a survey as to how 
people get to work each day,    how far
they travel and how long it takes them.
Statistics were taken from 202         
contributors.   (This does not mean 202
households,but nevertheless is 202     
individual travellers). The area has no
industry of its own. Only 3 people have
a home-based job,    everyone else must
travel to work.  G.E.C. is the largest 
employer in Stafford, but only 11.5% of
our survey work there.However,G.E.C. is
half-way into Stafford, and another    
57.5% work in Stafford itself.   If all
of these people take the direct route  
69% of our survey converge on Stafford 
by the main road each morning and leave
again in the evening.  (We cannot prove
exactly how many use it,as some will   
prefer a more circuitous but less      
frustrating route).
