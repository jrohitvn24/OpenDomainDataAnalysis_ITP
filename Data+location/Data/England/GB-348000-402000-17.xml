		<content>   Quotes to the question:-            
"How would you describe the area?"     
i.e. the new town area.                
1. A pleasant town but lacking in      
   enough places for the young to go to
2. As a punishment.                    
3. Could be better if there were enough
   jobs for the unemployed.            
4. It could be very nice if people     
   would make more effort to keep it   
   clean and tidy.                     
5. Could be a lovely place if the      
   people who live here took more pride
   in the place.                       
6. A depressing area.                  
7. Has an undeserved bad reputation.   
8. A nightmare from an architect's     
   drawingboard.                       
9. It would be lovely if everything    
   matched up to the beautiful trees   
   and shrubs that have been planted.
