		<content>  Most of our playground games have    
 rhymes which we have to say or sing.  
 Sometimes we have to chase each other,
 sometimes we have to creep up on each 
 other.  Hot Chocolate is one of these.
 Any number can play.  One person      
 stands out in front and hides his face
 whilst the others try to reach him    
 without being seen.  If anyone is     
 seen, everyone stands in a line, and  
 one person touches the finger of the  
 catcher.  He says "Hot Chocolate",    
 everyone runs and the person who gets 
 caught then stands out in front to    
 begin the game again.                 
  Red Letter is also played by any     
 number. The caller tells them which   
 letter is the red letter and that     
 means that any one with that letter in
 their name cannot move when the letter
 is called.
