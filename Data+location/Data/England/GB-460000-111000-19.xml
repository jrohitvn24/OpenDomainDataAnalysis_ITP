		<title>19AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD'S VIEW</title>
		<content> I have lived in the grid area, Denmead
 parish,for fifteen years and attended 
 schools outside of the area,travelling
 by car because of lack of buses. I    
 attended Brownies and then Guides     
 locally, also music, ballet and dance 
 lessons. I sing in Newtown Church     
 Choir. Recently I passed 4 G.C.E. "A" 
 levels and I begin studying chemistry 
 at Bristol University soon.I hope to  
 be an industrial research chemist. I  
 enjoy the peace and freedom of the    
 countryside, the narrow lanes, the    
 wildlife and the clean air. There is a
 great community spirit within the     
 village, with few social barriers.    
 Nationally, I'm concerned with the    
 falling economy and unemployment, and 
 universally with peace, arms control, 
 racism, human rights and political    
 freedom.
