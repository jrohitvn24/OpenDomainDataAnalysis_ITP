		<title>09The church in Thurlow</title>
		<content> The parish's new young rector inherits
 3 churches of which St Peter's in     
 Little Thurlow lies in this area. They
 alternately share the services of     
 Communion, Mattins and Evensong, plus 
 an innovative Family service. Its     
 lively and original content           
 illustrates the church's aim of       
 encouraging young families to worship 
 alongside its more established        
 members. The first family service     
 celebrated the church's own birthday  
 with a card signed by the whole       
 congregation and a cake made by the   
 children. A stewardship campaign is   
 starting in which church and          
 congregation together look at their   
 beliefs and commitments and how to put
 them into practice with available     
 finance and resources to benefit      
 families, neighbours and the church.
