		<content>      The area is subjected to the     
 prevailing South Westerly salty winds 
 which blow straight in from the       
 English Channel. It is somewhat       
 sheltered by the Lands End Peninsula  
 on the oppposite side of Mounts Bay.  
 These winds affect tree growth and    
 though there are small sheltered      
 plantations and valleys containing    
 trees and other foliage, the area is  
 as a consequence, mainly grassland.   
 The climate is relatively mild with   
 only small changes in seasonal        
 temperatures.These range from approx. 
 2 deg C in Winter to 22 deg C in      
 Summer. The surrounding seas with the 
 North Atlantic Drift effect bringing  
 warm currents also have an effect on  
 temp. Passing through the area is the 
 Coastal Footpath with its outstanding 
 and changing views. There are several 
 interesting circuit walks in the area.</content>
