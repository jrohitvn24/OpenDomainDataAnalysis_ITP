		<content> The Hobby Drive which runs from Hobby 
 Lodge to Clovelly through woodland    
 overlooking the sea,was built by Sir  
 James Hamlyn Williams. It was his     
 hobby,hence the name,and it gave work 
 to unemployed men after the Crimean   
 war.It is 3 miles long and is owned by
 the Clovelly Estate Company,it is part
 of the coastal footpath.Cars are      
 charged Â£1.20 to drive along it       
 pedestrians are free.Once everyone    
 living at Buck's Mills was called     
 Braund.Now the families are scattered 
 world wide.The Braund society has been
 formed and is a member of the         
 Federation of Family History          
 Societies.It aims to provide          
 opportunities for members to contact  
 each other and trace the family       
 origin.
