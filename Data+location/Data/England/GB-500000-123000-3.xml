		<content> Marshall's Farm keeps 140 Friesian    
 (black and white) cows. Lowfold has   
 140 Friesians and 180 pigs. Friesians,
 nicknamed 'water carts', are popular  
 in 1985 because their milk is less    
 creamy than Jerseys', and the modern  
 slimming craze demands less cream;    
 this also reduces blood cholesterol.  
 Gownfold keep 20 cows on 60 acres of  
 pastureland. The Milk Marketing Board 
 lorries collect the milk from these   
 farms daily. Buckfold keep beef cattle
 and four cows for breeding; unwanted  
 calves are sold at Guildford Market.  
 Linfold Farm is for sale and their    
 Friesian herd reduced to 12. Idehurst 
 Farmhouse is now a private house and  
 fields are let in units of 10 and 17  
 acres for small Friesian and beef     
 cattle herds. The little              
 'smallholding' of Bulchins has just 2 
 heifers and some poultry.             </content>
