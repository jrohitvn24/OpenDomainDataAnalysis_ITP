		<content> From being a small farming village    
 situated about 8 km north-east of     
 Luton, Stopsley ( still referred to   
 by older inhabitants as a{village})has
 grown into a fairly large suburb of   
 the town.  Although Stopsley has grown
 immensely in the last fifty years it  
 has not attracted industrial          
 development and has remained a        
 residential area. Stopsley contains   
 shops, churches, public houses,a large
 Regional Sports Centre, Fire Station  
 and other local ammenities. People    
 interviewed would prefer a greater    
 variety of shops. The old Manor House 
 of Putteridgebury has been converted  
 into a Management College. There is   
 plenty of open parkland, playing      
 fields and farmland  which give five  
 views of the town, making Stopsley an 
 attractive area in which to live.
