		<content> There are some very expensive         
 properties in this area. Estimates of 
 their values varied from Â£50,000 to   
 Â£500,000. Many houses have interesting
 histories, and will be dealt with on  
 subsequent pages, and most of them now
 have electricity supplies but not     
 mains gas.                            
                                       
 There is an estate of {Council Houses}
 in Knowl Hill. These were built in    
 1951/2 .                              
{Prefabs},also in Knowl Hill, built in 
 1948 are still in use as temporary    
 housing for the homeless.             
 Mains Drainage  was brought to the    
 area in  1984.
