		<content> Television broadcasts in 1985 are     
 entertaining,most children's lives    
 evolve around them.There are a wide   
 selection of broadcasts to watch,some 
 may come under these                  
 categories,drama,comedy,light         
 entertainment,mystery and suspense.In 
 the age group 11-12 years the title   
 of the programme we are previewing is 
 called "The Young Ones".It is centred 
 round four characters who are students
 at Scrumpback College and have a      
 chaotic time in their ram-shackled old
 dump of a house.The first character   
 has a serious and funny side,he tends 
 to be the cool,the second is a hippy  
 who is always being picked on by the  
 third who is a common British punk(non
 conformer).The last character is a    
 young student who likes to think he   
 rules the house.Parents feel that it  
 gives people the wrong attitude.      </content>
