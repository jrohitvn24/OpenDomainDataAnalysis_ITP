 people over 16. 80% of those so       
 occupied are self employed or members 
 of the farmer's family; there are few 
 farm workers' jobs. Nearly all the    
 farms have 2 or more tractors (av. 3).
 50% of farms use contractors for some 
 work eg. silaging, harvesting, hedge

 building, shopkeeping, graphic design,
 cooking, cleaning, hairdressing, etc.
