		<content> The water mill was built in 1165 and  
 the money from the mill was given to  
 the white Friar monks at Blanchland.It
 was ruined many times by raiders from 
 across the border.Then in 1910 William
 Strachan used the power to drive      
 machines and a dynamo for electricity.
 In 1975 it was converted to a private 
 house.                                
                                       
 The Wellington Hotel was built in     
 1660. It was first used as a house for
 the people who owned the mill. It was 
 changed into a hotel in 1825.         
                                       
 The  Pack Horse Bridge was built in   
 the sixteenth century for the horses  
 taking the corn to the mill, because  
 it was difficult to ford the burn when
 it was in flood.
