		<title>13Shopping Interviews.</title>
		<content> The shop that we found was visited the
 most was Liptons.We found out that    
 Liptons as well as being the most     
 visited, was the most expensive. I    
 think most people visit Liptons       
 because it has more variety and the   
 food may be better than that in the   
 CO-OP. We have found that food shops  
 are more popular than non food shops. 
 Food shops are most used because we   
 need food more than clothes or        
 newspapers.Some people would like a   
 laundrette, Amusements, Decor Shop, or
 a Fresh Fish Shop. I think people     
 would like these because it would be  
 useful to have them instead of having 
 to go to town.                        
  People werent bothered if the shop   
 opened earlier or later  because they 
 will have got used to the times. If   
 they were at home all day they could  
 go shopping when they wanted to.      </content>
