		<content> Beer is a small village on the coast  
 of East Devon.It nestles deep in a    
 valley leading to the sea.During the  
 summer the population grows as Beer   
 swells with visitors.The beach        
 obviously is an attraction.The pebbles
 curve in a crescent shape facing      
 south and south east and the beach is 
 backed by white cliffs which makes it 
 a sun trap.                           
                                       
    The area immediately around Beer is
 rural and agricultural.It is an area  
 of flat topped hills deeply cut by    
 valleys.Beer also has had interests in
 quarrying,the Beer stone can be seen  
 in some cathedrals and many local     
 churches.Fishing used to play a more  
 prominent  part in the village,but now
 tourism is one of the main            
 occupations.
