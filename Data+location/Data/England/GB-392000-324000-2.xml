A look near John Wheeldon School       
(bottom left hand grid )               
This is a built up area of             
Stafford,with a few open spaces and    
play parks.                            
                                       
There are a  number of factories,      
ranging from the old established firm  
of Lotus, to the new industrial        
estate.Most of the property in this    
area is old, with a great number of    
terraced houses some of which are over 
100 years old.Shopping facilities are  
extremely varied,but consisting mostly 
of the old "corner shop",where you are 
welcome to buy not only that loaf of   
bread you forgot but also for a good   
old natter.This is essentially an      
"old"community but for all that        
extremely lively.
