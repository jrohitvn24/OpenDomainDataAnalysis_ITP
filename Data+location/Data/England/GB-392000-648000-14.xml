		<content>  A group of parents formed a committee
 which now runs the school as a        
 co-educational venture.This is well   
 supported and has filled a great need 
 in the area.The lodges and the stables
 were sold off to private buyers while 
 the fields were sold to neighbouring  
 farmers.The wooded land adjacent      
 to the front drive to the house       
 has been divided into plots for the   
 building of houses.These sales have   
 taken place in order to finance the   
 school.
