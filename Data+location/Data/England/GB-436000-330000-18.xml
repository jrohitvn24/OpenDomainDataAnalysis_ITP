		<title>18FARMING</title>
		<content> It is a well-known fact that some 1%  
 of all farmland in Britain is lost    
 annually to urban growth. This can be 
 well demonstrated in the Derby area.  
 Within the suburbs themselves there   
 are buildings which can be identified 
 as former farm houses now surrounded  
 not with fields but with rows of      
 terraced and semi-detached housing.   
 The process is still continuing, as   
 schools, playing fields and new       
 housing estates swallow up land       
 adjacent to the city both in          
 Chellaston and Alvaston. Farmers are  
 influenced by the economic pressures  
 but also by the problems of farming   
 near to new estates. Animals are      
 disturbed, crops damaged, litter      
 dropped, fences broken down.Such      
 problems are aggravated when footpathe
 provide short cuts to other villages  
 or country parks.                     </content>
