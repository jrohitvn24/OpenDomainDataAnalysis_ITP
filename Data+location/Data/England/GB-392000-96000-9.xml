		<content>    The{Charborough Estate}is run with 
 care and a consciousness of           
{conservation issues.}When hedgerows   
 are cut, trees are left standing to   
 grow to maturity, and tags to         
 identify them are fixed. There is a   
{tree planting policy}and beech and oak
 trees are planted in the park within  
 specially constructed, strong tree    
 guards to protect them from browsing  
 deer.                                 
    There are{no public rights of way  
 across the park, although the whole   
 area within the brick walls is        
 criss-crosssed by estate roads.       
    There is a{shooting syndicate,}and 
 shooting game, (mainly pheasant) is   
 part of the Estate revenue. Shooting  
 is an expensive hobby and a lot of    
 money is paid for the privilege.
