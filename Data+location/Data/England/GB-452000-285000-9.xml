		<content>{ SHED CATCH:}This is a game for 4-10  
 people played around our shed.Four    
 metres away there is a long slab.One  
 person is on,the others go round the  
 shed.                                 
   The game is played by the people    
 trying to get over the line without   
 being caught.They do not run around   
 the shed because the 'it' is not      
 allowed past halfway.If someone gets  
 past the line they may go back to help
 their companions.When you are on (or  
 caught which makes you on) you count  
 up to five so the others can get away.

{VETS:}Around our playground there is a
 big bush which you can go inside.In it
 there are three logs which the person 
 acting the animal sits on.There is    
 also a branch which the person acting 
 as the vet sits on. {
