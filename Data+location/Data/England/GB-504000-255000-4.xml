		<title>04Wayside Stalls</title>
		<content> Around Ravensden and Thurleigh lots of
 people who have flowers fruit and     
 vegetables for sale leave them outside
 their gates. They put the things on a 
 kind of table with a notice saying how
 much the things cost. They put money  
 trays out so that people who buy      
 things can leave their money in them. 
 Most people are honest and pay for    
 things but some people are not. One   
 day a farmer who lives in Thurleigh   
 put some eggs out to sell while he was
 at work. Somebody stole the eggs.     
 I live in Ravensden and a man who     
 lives near me sells apples, but he has
 never been robbed. These stalls are   
 very useful to people because there   
 are no shops nearby.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
