		<content>    Efford is a residential area of    
 Plymouth that was built just after the
 2nd World War. The houses are mainly  
 steel houses built by Italian and     
 German prisoners of war. Most of the  
 houses are rented by the City Council,
 but some of the houses have been sold 
 to the tenants recently. The streets  
 are named after rivers. There used to 
 be a large estate of prefabricated    
 houses (called prefabs) built during  
 the 2nd World War, to house the people
 who had lost their homes in the war.  
 these houses were made in factories   
 and erected on site. This estate was  
 called Little America because the     
 streets were named after American     
 States. There ia now an estate of new 
 houses which is also called Little    
 America on this site.
