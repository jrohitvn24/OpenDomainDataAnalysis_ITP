		<content> We distributed a questionnaire to each
 of the houses in Alderton which were  
 in our block. We returned one week    
 later to collect them. About 50% of   
 them were completed. We were          
 interested in where the people came   
 from. 35 out of the 46 people were not
 born locally. The most distant        
 birthplace was Glasgow. Of the local  
 people only 3 were born in the village
 itself. As most of the houses,        
 according to our survey, are modern   
 this means that local people are not  
 buying the new houses. The average age
 of the people is 57 which suggests    
 that the younger people cannot afford 
 the new houses. The recreational      
 activities followed reflect the rural 
 area. Swimming was the most popular   
 sporting activity and gardening,      
 walking,reading, television and       
 cookery were favoured pastimes.       </content>
