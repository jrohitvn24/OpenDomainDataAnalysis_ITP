		<title>04Tavistock Houses -old &amp; new</title>
		<content>  Many of the houses in our area were  
 built in the 60s and 70s,although some
 were built as early as the 1800s.Some 
 houses in Tavistock were built for the
{Duke of Bedford's}mine workers.In the 
 main street most of the houses are    
 above the shops.          On the moors
 most of the houses are very old.{Devon
{Longhouses}are the oldest,built around
 the 1600s. They were built on hills   
 and had two levels.They had a door at 
 the top, and a ladder leading to the  
 bottom where the animals used to live.
        St.David's and Campion Rise    
 are some of the newest developments:  
 College Avenue and Old Exeter Road are
 the oldest streets.A majority of the  
 houses in Tavistock are semi-detached.
        The housing area around        
 Greenlands is mostly council houses   
 although approximately 30% of these   
 are now owner-occupied.               </content>
