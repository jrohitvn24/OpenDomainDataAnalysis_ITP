		<content>     The{Bull's Head Inn}was bought by 
 the Spencers, a Derbyshire farming    
 family,for Â£76,000 from Bass. The inn 
 is listed in 1794 as a stopping place 
 for coaches on the London to          
 Wirksworth Rd. There is a London      
 milestone on the{Gorses.}Itwas a      
 turnpike and used to have a toll.The  
 front room used to be a blacksmiths   
 and there are marks on the beams of   
 the horseshoes.It was bought by George
 Offiler in 1882 for Â£620 from a farmer
 and Bass bought it in 1961.           
     There was a cottage at the top of{
{Jesses Lane}and there was a carrier   
 who lived with his dog. One day the   
 dog died because it was always chained
 to the wheel of the cart.The dog now  
 haunts the lane and it can be heard   
 walking and rattling its chain down   
 Jesses Lane.
