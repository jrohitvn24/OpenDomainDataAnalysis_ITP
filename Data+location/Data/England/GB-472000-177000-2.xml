		<title>02 LOCAL AMENITIES</title>
		<content>                                       
 The area concerned contains a total of
less than twenty different amenities.  
Most of these are centered in or around
Binfield Heath. These include several  
Public Houses one of which we will     
look at in greater detail later, as    
it has an interesting local history.   
 Other amenities include two Post      
Offices, a chip shop, two general      
stores, a garage (which has to serve a 
very large area, but because of the low
population, does no more business than 
one in a major town), two public parks,
a church, a water pumping station (in  
Caversham) and a bus service which     
serves only a small area to the south  
of the section.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
