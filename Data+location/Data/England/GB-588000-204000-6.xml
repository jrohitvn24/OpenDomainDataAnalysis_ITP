		<title>06MUNDON - WHAT CROPS TO GROW?</title>
		<content>  The price of cereals is falling      
 dramatically and so farmers might     
 start growing different crops.A few   
 years ago wheat was selling at Â£127 @ 
 ton but now it only fetches Â£97.At the
 same time the price of fertilizer,    
 insecticide,weedkiller etc. has risen.
  Farmers think the situation is going 
 to get even worse and so they are     
 thinking of trying more profitable    
 crops such as sunflowers and lupins.  
 Oil can be extracted from both of     
 these plants.The Common Market offers 
 a guaranteed price for oil seed rape  
 and that has become a popular crop.   
 Some farmers will not grow it because 
 the flower has such an unpleasant     
 smell.                                
  Because of these problems farmers are
 thinking of going back to mixed       
 farming.
