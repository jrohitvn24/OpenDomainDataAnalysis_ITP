		<content> Draycott in the Clay is at least 6    
 miles from any of the nearby towns,   
 which means that life saving services 
 can be 15 minutes away, however the   
 pleasures of living in the country    
 outweigh such worries for most people.
                                       
 The area is very fortunate to have an 
 excellent doctors' group practice     
 based at Sudbury.                     
                                       
 Also at Sudbury there is an open      
 prison from which many prisoners have 
 absconded, however very few villagers 
 are worried about this.               
                                       
 There is a bus service to and from    
 Burton and Uttoxeter 4 or 5 times a   
 day; and once a fortnight a mobile    
 library parks in the village for half 
 an hour.                              
                                       </content>
