		<content> Generally speaking people think this  
 is a good area to live in with        
 friendly neighbours and nice gardens. 
   Some of the things people dislike   
 about this area are the rates,litter  
 and violence.Most people though,feel  
 safe here but a few are concerned     
 about the rising crime  rate.         
   An overwhelming majority feel are   
 sufficient.However bus services are in
 frequent but trains are good.         
   In general people think there are   
 enough open spaces but some express   
 concern that there aren't enough safe 
 childrens playgrounds.The general     
 feeling is that streets are           
 reasonabally clean except when there  
 is snow and in shoppin areas too.
