		<title>18PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> There is{very little public transport;
 most people have their{own cars}to get
 to and from work.  The only two points
 at which{buses}can be boarded (New Inn
 and Hanbury cross roads) are both a   
 long walk from most houses.           
                                       
 A bus to nearby Burton leaves the New 
 Inn at 7.55 am each weekday, returning
 from Burton at 4.35 pm.  On Thursdays 
 (market day) and Saturdays there is an
 extra bus leaving at 10.40 am and     
 returning from Burton at 1.35 pm.     
                                       
 A bus to Burton via Anslow leaves     
 Hanbury cross roads at 8.20 am, with  
 the return from Burton at 4.30 pm and 
 5.45 pm.  There is an extra bus on    
 Wednesday and Saturday.
