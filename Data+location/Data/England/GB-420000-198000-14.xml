		<content>{ }The Victoria Memorial Hall is a big 
 meeting place. It was given to the    
 town by Mrs. James Jones in 1919. A   
 kitchen, bar and toilets have been    
 added to the main hall. It is used all
 year for meetings, dances, discos and 
 rummage sales and is the stage for    
 pantomimes and plays. It is           
 administered by a committee. On       
 Sundays it is used as a Baptist Church
 by some members of the American Armed 
 Forces living locally. The rest of the
