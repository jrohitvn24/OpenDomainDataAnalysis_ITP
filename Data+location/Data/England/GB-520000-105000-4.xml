		<content> FARMING-THE DOWNS                     
 On Tuesday 18th June a group of us    
 wentto survey the farming of the      
 Downs.  Having walked along the Upper 
 Shoreham Road we crossed the dual     
 carriageway of the A27 and started    
 looking at the fields. We saw some    
 grazing land that was being used by   
 horses.In the next field we saw       
 barley. We noticed that most of the   
 fields had chalk soil.Then we saw a   
 giant field of broad beans.The hills  
 were bumpy and so was our track.      
 Another main crop we saw was wheat. We
 looked at the difference between wheat
 and barley,and found that barley had  
 hairs and wheat did not. As we walked 
 back we looked from a high hill and   
 saw the fields of wheat and barley    
 that we had passed.{
