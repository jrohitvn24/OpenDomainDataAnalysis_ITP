		<title>01Bridlington Introduction</title>
		<content>    Bridlington is a seaside resort on 
 the east coast of Yorkshire, just     
 south of Flamborough Head. The        
 population of some 29,000 depends     
 largely on tourism and fishing,       
 although the latter has declined in   
 recent years.                         
    Within the original Old Town stands
 the Priory Church and Bayle Gate; the 
 remains of the Augustinian Monastery. 
 The Old Town is also well known for   
 its Georgian frontages and narrow     
 streets.                              
    The harbour is home to a small     
 fishing fleet and shelter for many    
 small boats and yachts, pleasure craft
 and cobles. It is overlooked by       
 Bridlington's only high-rise(11       
 stories) block of flats.              
    The residential areas near the     
 harbour and centre are taken up with  
 hotels, holiday flats, etc.           </content>
