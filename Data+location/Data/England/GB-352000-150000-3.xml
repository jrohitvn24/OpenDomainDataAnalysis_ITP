		<title>03STOCKHILL FOREST, PRIDDY</title>
		<content>                                       
 Stockhill forest  has been established
 on land once used for lead mining. The
 area still has the scars of its       
 earlier use. Today, Stockhill is      
 managed by the Forestry Commission and
 fir trees are by far the most common  
 tree.                                 
 The ground is soft and springy and the
 whole area is a haven for wildlife.   
 Adders can be found in profusion and  
 walkers are advised to be careful.    
 There are a number of water tanks     
 scattered throughout the forest incase
 water is needed to fight a fire.      
 The forest has become a popular       
 place for walks and at Christmas time 
 many local people buy their Christmas 
 trees from the forest.
