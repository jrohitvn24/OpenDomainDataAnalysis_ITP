		<content> Besides Wedges Bakery and the shop at 
 the Trout Farm on the Stratford Road  
 the only other shops within our area  
 are the shops on the Cheswick Green   
 estate.The shops were built at the    
 same time as the houses on the estate 
 so that the people living here had    
 shopping facilities within walking    
 distance.The Cheswick Green shops     
 include Servowarm( a shop selling     
 central heating and showers)The       
 Vineyard(an Off Licence)a newsagents, 
 a hardware shop and finally a general 
 food store.                           
 The shops are open every day except   
 Sunday,with the exception of the      
 newsagents which is open on Sunday    
 morning.                              
 The people living on the Cheswick     
 Green estate make good use of the     
 shops for quick shopping for items    
 they forget at the supermarket.       </content>
