		<content> Girl Guide Camp.                      
                                       
 The Girl Guides went to camp in       
 Ludworth. We had a good time but it   
 was a long walk up to the campsite and
 we were all tired when we got there.  
 Romiley and Cherry Tree Guides went as
 we are all in Kinder Division.        
 We slept in tents and enjoyed         
 ourselves during the weekend.         
 On the Saturday two brownies were     
 reported missing and a policeman was  
 called in with a dog. They went to    
 search in the wood, but luckily it    
 turned out to be a false alarm.       
 On Sunday we all went home.
