		<title>13Burton Village</title>
		<content> If you were to visit Burton's village 
 lanes you would be able to pick your  
 own strawberries and raspberries, and 
 sometimes blackberries.  We have a    
 small recreation ground with a        
 roundabout, some swings and a slide.  
 For older teenagers there is a youth  
 club, which was opened earlier this   
 year.                                 
                                       
 Until recently there were only two    
 shops in the village - a              
 newsagent/sweetshop and a sub-post    
 office/grocery.  Now we have six shops
 and two public houses.  We have two   
 churches, St.Luke's and the United    
 Reform Church, which face each other  
 across the village green.  St. Luke's 
 is our school church, and we go there 
 for services.
