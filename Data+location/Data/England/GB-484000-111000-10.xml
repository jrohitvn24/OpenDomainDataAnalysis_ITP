 This building was built in the 14th   
 century by prisoners of the wars in   
 France.There is a garage on one       
 end,which when first built was a      
 wash-house.                           
  STAPLES PLACE                        
 This old cottage is positioned neatly 
 beside the church gate.It has a small 
 barn beside it,which used to be a     
 blacksmiths.It is built from flint,but
 has never been thatched.It was built  
 in the 18th century,and is still in   
 its original condition.               
  THE POST OFFICE                      
 This,at 500 years,is one of the       
 village's oldest buildings,and has    
 been a shop since its construction.   
 However,100 years ago,it was moved to 
 its present position,next to the River
 Lavant.It is built from chalk,stone   
 and plaster,which is an old method.   </content>
