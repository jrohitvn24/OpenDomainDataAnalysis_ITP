 The church was rebuilt on this site in
 1870.   Two previous sites were at    
 Prior's Acre &amp; Little Marcle Court    
 where part of a wall &amp; some tombstones
 are still standing.                   
 The church plate dates from l57l &amp; the
 list of rectors goes back to the l2th 
 century.   The reredos and two-manual 
 organ were given by Lady Henry        
 Somerset.   Little Marcle parish has  
 recently been combined with St.       
 Michael's Ledbury and the Rector of   
 Ledbury will shortly be inducted as   
 Priest-in-Charge.
