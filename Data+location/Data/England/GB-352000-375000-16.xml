  At 8am I got up and went down stairs 
 to watch television. I stayed         
 downstairs for half an hour before I  
 went up again and got dressed. I put  
 on shirt, shorts and a tracksuit. At  
 9am I had toast for breakfast while I 
 watched television, and at 9.30am we  
 went in the car to Chester to have my 
 tennis lesson. I was back by 11.30am. 
 Some friends from Sheffield came. We  
 chatted and had coffee until 1pm when 
 we had lunch.Mum cooked a roast pork  
 dinner. At 3.30pm we went for a walk  
 up the hill and were back for 4.30. We
 had a cup of tea and after I played on
 my computer until 6.30pm. Then my mum 
 and dad went out for a meal, I went to
 a friends to watch a film on his      
 video. I had sausage and chips there, 
 watching TV until Mum and Dad came    
 back at 10pm. I went to bed at 10.30pm</content>
