   {As Mottingham May Queen},I was to  
lead a procession on a bright sunny May
weekend. I walked with a fiddler in    
front,my prince and crown bearer beside
me and the dancing school behind me.We 
walked through Mottingham Village and  
into Dorset Road School. There I was   
crowned by the previous May Queen.I    
made a short speech and sat on the     
throne to watch the Maypole dancers    
majorettes perform.                    
                                       
   Annual visits are made by 6 Eltham  
school children to Westminster Abbey,in
order to lay flowers on the tomb of    
{Prince John of Eltham.}The son of     
Edward the 2nd.,he died fighting the   
Scots in 1336.Horn Park,Middle Park    
and Wyborne  Primary Schools take part 
in this custom.The schools are all near
to Eltham Palace.                      </content>
