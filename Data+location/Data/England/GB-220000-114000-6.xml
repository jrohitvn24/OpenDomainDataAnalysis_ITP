		<title>06Morwenstow - R. S. Hawker</title>
		<content> Revd. Robert Stephen Hawker  (1803-75)
 is Morwenstow's best-known  character.
 Vicar for 40 years,  he  founded{Saint
{Mark's School,}built the{Old Vicarage,
 was responsible for the road bridge at
{Coombe  Valley, }reintroduced {Harvest
{Festivals,}now observed throughout the
 country,  and  composed  what has been
 described   as   Cornwall's   national
 anthem,{"And shall Trelawney die?".   
 His  reputation still has an impact on
 the parish.                           
 There  are  at least four biographies;
 the  definintive one by {Piers Brendon
 was published  in 1975,  the centenary
 of Hawker's death.  During the festiv-
 ities {Lord Ramsey, }ex-archbishop  of
 Canterbury, preached  to a large  con_
 gregation  which  overflowed  into the
 churchyard,  where  the sermon was re-
 layed by  loudspeakers.  Two pews were
 reserved for Hawker's descendants.    </content>
