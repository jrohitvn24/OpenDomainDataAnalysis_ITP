		<title>06Blandford - A School Day.</title>
		<content> My best day is Thursday.I wake up at  
 6.15 and read for an hour. Usually I  
 have 3 slices of toast for breakfast. 
 I get dressed at 8 o'clock &amp; pack my  
 bag for school. At 8.30 I ride to     
 school in the car. I look for Carly   
 but if I can't find her I look for    
 Rachel &amp; Tracy. We do silent reading  
 first; I'm reading Romana the Pest.   
 Next it's handwriting usually a poem, 
 my best is'There was an Old Man with a
 Beard'.At 10.15 it's assembly.The     
 Rector talks to us &amp; today I played   
 treble recorder in the band.After play
 I go for science. We learnt about     
 magnets &amp; now we're doing circuits. In
 lunchtime I go to Rainbow Club &amp; then 
 its games-Short Tennis is my          
 favourite. At the end of the day its  
 storytime with Mrs Davis. We've just  
 finished 'Midnight Fox'.{ }
