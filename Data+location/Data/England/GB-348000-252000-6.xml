		<title>06Ivington Camp,Iron Age Fort</title>
		<content> In square No 1 of our area to the     
 north west of Hope_under_Dinmore is   
 an{Iron Age hill_fort}called{Ivington 
{Camp.}It stands{400 feet high}at the  
 western end of a little ridge.It is   
{triangular}in shape and covers about  
{half a square mile.}The magnificently 
 built banks and ditches are completely
 hidden by dense trees.About 35 years  
 ago the present trees were planted to 
 replace older ones then felled.This   
 planting was done badly so that it is 
 now impossible to see anything of the 
 fort. Within the ramparts is a farm   
 called{Camp Farm.}It is owned by Mr   
 Stevens.The{northern}and{western sides
 of the camp are supposed to{follow Ley
{Lines.}Mr Stevens showed us a{60 foot 
{deep well cut through solid rock.}This
 well has{never dried up.}Mr Stevens   
 uses it for all his needs.Who dug the 
 well and when is a complete mystery   </content>
