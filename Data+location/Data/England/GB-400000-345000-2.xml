Kingsley. The elderly are well         
catered for as essentials can be       
bought from the butchers grocers,      
haberdashers/ hardware and Post Office 
shops. Mobile vans with fresh fish,    
fish and chips and Library books call.

facilities are lacking there is a      
voluntary drug collection service.     
  For other facilities there is an     
hourly bus service from Cheadle        
to Hanley. The local coach company

appreciate the pre-school play-group

attended and has a thriving Sunday     
School. Various clubs are well         
supported, the WI, keep-fit, Yoga,
