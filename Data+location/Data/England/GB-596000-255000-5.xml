		<title>05Buxhall - Farming: Issues</title>
		<content> Whilst farming is important to the    
 area its success is currently causing 
 some concern.{Disposal of surplus     
{cereal straw}by burning is considered 
 unsocial by causing pollution, damage 
 to countryside and wildlife. Local    
 demand for straw is limited. With     
 little needed for livestock, some is  
 sold for processing into animal feed  
 or building board but most has to be  
 otherwise disposed of. With the threat
 of a total ban on burning farmers are 
 increasingly chopping and ploughing in
 the straw. Modern farming methods have
 necessitated the{removal of several   
{old hedges,}although the large scale  
 removal of woodland is no longer      
 considered economically viable. The   
{EEC Agricultural Policy,}creating     
 surplus cereal production places an   
 uncertain future on farming and thus  
 the future prosperity of the area.    </content>
