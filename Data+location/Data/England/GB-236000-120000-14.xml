		<title>14THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>   Our school was built in 1865. It is 
 made of stone. Since 1865 the school  
 has had a lot of changes made. We     
 haven't got very many people in our   
 school only 42 chidren and two        
 fulltime teachers. The headteacher of 
 our school is called Mr.Roe. The      
 infant teacher is called Mrs.         
 Attewell.                             
    We have got three supply teachers: 
 Mrs. Biddulph, Mrs. Scambler and      
 sometimes Mrs. Leat.                  
    We have two school gardens and one 
 school swimming pool (Yipee!!). The   
 swimming pool is only 7.45 m long and 
 5 metres wide.                        
    We've got two playgrounds. Our     
 biggest playground is 47 metres long  
 and 16 metres wide. Our little        
 playground is a funny shape but all   
 together it measures 127 metres.
