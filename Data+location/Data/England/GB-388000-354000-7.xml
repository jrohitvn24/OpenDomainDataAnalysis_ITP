Bemersley waste disposal tip.          
  Greenway Bank Country Park lies one  
mile off the A527 on the Bemersley to  
Brown Edge road.It consists of several 
types of ecosystems typified by Beech; 
Oak;Sycamore;Silver Birch;Ash;and Rowan
trees.The scrubland has characteristic 
vetation of Bramble;Gorse;Tormentil;Rye
Grass;Cocksfoot and Rose Bay Willow    
Herb.Also in this habitat are a number 
of Rhododendron shrubs,planted when the
park was privately owned.Meadowland    
accounts for a small percentage of the 
park.The Serpentine lake is the habitat
of fish such as pike and roach.It is   
used as a resting place by water fowl. 
  Bemersley tip is a colliery spoil    
heap and is slowly being recolonised by
the process of succession.
