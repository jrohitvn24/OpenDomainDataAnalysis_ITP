		<content> I have a good neighbour 200 yards away
 we have just met and exchanged 6      
 months news.  She has rushed home to  
 her sheep, I to my teaching.          
 The evening WI started l0 years ago   
 for folk like us, I felt I knew every-
 one in the village then.  Now, so many
 older residents have gone and those   
 who replace them- at great expense,   
 houses are so dear- increasingly use  
 the village as a dormitory and do not 
 take part in village life.  As a      
 previously town dwelling incomer this 
 makes me sad.                         
 Be positive- we still have our post   
 office and shop.  I can still look up 
 the hills across the orchards to the  
 woods.  The lovely colour changes tell
 me the seasons whatever the weather.  
 I can still find primroses, bluebells 
 and blackberries in season, and there 
 is still the /very/ occasional red bus</content>
