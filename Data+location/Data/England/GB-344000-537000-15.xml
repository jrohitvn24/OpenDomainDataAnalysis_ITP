		<title>15BRACKENBURGH MANSION</title>
		<content> Originally a pele tower (a defended   
 farmstead) within the Royal Inglewood 
 Forest, the building was substantially
 extended in 1902.                     
                                       
 The grounds are exceptionally well    
 tended for a building of this size,   
 and contain a small but deep swimming 
 pool.                                 
                                       
 An interesting feature of Brackenburgh
 is the "Ha Ha", which is a concealed  
 wall designed to prevent the entry of 
 cattle, without obstructing the       
 landscape and view.                   
                                       
 In the period of extension, a large   
 archway was moved to the entrance     
 area. A back road entrance was        
 abandoned as being too steep for      
 practical purposes.
