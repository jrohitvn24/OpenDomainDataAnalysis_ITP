		<title>09HUXHAM BARTON FARM</title>
		<content> There has been a settlement on the    
 site since the Bronze Age.            
 Mr Yendell has lived there since 1952,
 also the history of the house is      
 quite interesting.A typical day on the
 farm: Mr Yendell gets up at seven     
 and gets two cups of coffee, one for  
 Mrs Yendell and one for himself.      
 Then he goes outside and feeds the    
 cows and checks on things. After that 
 he goes out to the drive and says     
 goodbye to his children who are going 
 to school. When Mrs Yendell comes home
 Mr Yendell has breakfast with her,then
 Mr Yendell goes out to do the silage  
 making,while Mrs Yendell does  the    
 hens and things. At dinner time he    
 comes into the kitchen and they both  
 have cheese and biscuits and bread.   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
