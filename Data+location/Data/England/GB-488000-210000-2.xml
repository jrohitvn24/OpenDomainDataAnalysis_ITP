		<title>02Farming around Aston Clinton</title>
		<content>    Most farms today are a mixture     
 between crop and livestock. Around    
 Aston Clinton there are quite a few   
 farms. Most of them are a mixture     
 but there are also two dairy farms.   
 Most farms also have a lot of         
 machinery for harvesting, sowing      
 seeds, and spraying to make them grow 
 more quickly and made into a better   
 crop for making flour, bread and other
 things. The mill at Tring which is    
 called Heygates takes most of the seed
 to make flour and bread. One of the   
 dairy farms is called B and M         
 dairies. The other one is not actually
 a dairy farm but it still has cows and
 a milking parlour. Some of the farms  
 only grow crops: wheat, barley, and   
 grass for hay or silage.
