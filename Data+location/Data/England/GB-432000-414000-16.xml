		<title>16The End of Chevet Hall</title>
		<content>   On July 26,l955 a sale of the       
 contents of Chevet Hall was held at   
 the Hall. The sale was attended by    
 many people including the grandmother 
 of one of my friends.  Apart from the 
 many local people who were there in   
 the hope of gaining a souvenir there  
 were antique dealers from all over the
 country.                              
   All sorts of items were offered for 
 sale from whole staircases to doors   
 and fabrics.  My friend's grandmother 
 did not buy anything because most of  
 the items were too expensive to buy.  
  It was an unusual experioence for the
 local people who went to see parts of 
 the Hall being sold off.              
  Immediately after the sale of items  
 demolition started.The land on which  
 the Hall stood was sold and a more    
 modern house is there in its place.The
 Park contains a large Garden Centre.  </content>
