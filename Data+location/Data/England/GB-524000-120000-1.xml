		<content> This area is part of the beautiful    
 weald of{Kent}and{Sussex.}It is rural,
 mainly mixed farms, market gardens,   
 woods and two mill ponds. Soil is     
 heavy, fertile wealden clay. Fields   
 are medium-sized, average about twenty
 hectares. Old hedges make a rich      
 habitat for a wide variety of         
 wildlife.                             
   There is extensive woodland, mainly 
 deciduous, carpeted abundently with   
 bluebells and wood anemones in spring.
 Undisturbed banks of primroses, wild  
 orchids and many other wild flowers   
 abound through the seasons.           
   Off the{A272}into Bolney village, on
 the left, there are four old cottages 
 and on the right there is a garden.   
 The garden was first going to have    
 houses built there, but now they have 
 built houses further up called        
 'Drovers'.                            </content>
