		<title>01CUFFLEY VILLAGE.</title>
		<content> Cuffley is not a small village but is 
 not big enough to be classified as a  
 town.Cuffley village has enough shops 
 to keep you going, but places called  
 Enfield,Potters Bar and Cheshunt are  
 towns about five miles away and if you
 haven't got a car there are train or  
 bus routes for you.For the elderly    
 there is sheltered housing called     
 Greenfields.We have three Churches the
 Free Church,St.Andrews and the Roman  
 Catholic Church.We have two telephone 
 boxes,one down Station Road and one at
 the Station.Station road is so named  
 because Cuffley Station is adjacent to
 it.The trains go to Kings Cross,      
 Moorgate and Hertford North.Tolmers   
 Road is probably the longest road in  
 Cuffley.There are lots of post boxes  
 round Cuffley.There are two pubs,a    
 library,ayouth centre,a clinic and a  
 hall.It is a pleasant place to live.  </content>
