		<title>04 Wilde Street</title>
		<content>  The small hamlet of Wilde Street was 
named after a Dr.Wilde, an old English 
name. The Street dates back to Roman   
times and Roman coins and artefacts    
have been found in local fields. There 
are 25 bungalows,5 houses,9 flint      
cottages,6 farms,a {coal merchant},and 
a {builder}.  There was a pond at the  
end of Wildmere Lane,where reeds used  
to be cut  for thatching,but this      
pond has dried  up. Another pond has   
been enlarged by a farmer,an island    
added and the pond stocked with wild   
life. Apart from wild birds, there are 
pheasants,peacocks,fancy hens and      
other exotic birds reared  by the      
farmer.   Breach Drove was where the   
residents  used to collect their water 
from a well. One resident remembers    
collecting water using a yoke and two  
buckets.                               
                                       </content>
