		<content>   The headline for the week was       
{'TREACHERY'.}This was when the health 
 chiefs of Waltham Forest Health       
 Authority were accused by the EFCC    
 (Epping Forest County Council) of     
 treachery because orders have been    
 given to close Forest Hospital after  
 assurances that it would stay open.   
   Other headlines stories included a  
 local builder who  had all his tools  
 stolen from his van, and{'Neighbours  
{To The Rescue In Kitchen Blaze',}when 
 a pensioner and some neighbours fought
 a really ferocious kitchen fire in    
 Colebrook Gardens, saving the house   
 from being gutted. {                  
{ }In the{1985 Prodigal Son Returns}   
 some children from our school were in 
 the paper because of the church       
 service that they took part in. {
