		<title>07FENCE MILL</title>
		<content>    1884 Fence Mill was built.It is the
 biggest building in Fence.It was a    
 cotton mill.The fabric was made by    
 spinning the cotton here and then it  
 was also woven here.                  
    With times changing and more goods 
 being imported about 15 years ago the 
 mill closed down .Every single worker 
 there  was put out of work.           
               The cottages around the 
 mill were built by the mill           
 owners and rented out to the          
 workers.Over the years the workers    
 were allowed to buy the cottages      
 cheaply if they had worked there for a
 long time.In 1980 mill reopened       
 containing two separate industries.The
 mill lodge was filled with enormous   
 goldfish.But now it has been drained  
 out.
