 Wednesday and Friday night. They are  
 divided into groups, the{Falcons}who  
 meet on Fridays and the{Eagles}who    
 meet on Wednesdays. I am a member of  
 the Eagles troop. We meet at 7.30 pm  
 and stand on{parade in uniform-}green

 neckerchief and grey trousers.        
 We change into old clothes and play a 
 game and then we work for one of the  
{badges listed in the handbook.}These  
 cover a wide range of activities      
 including{art, craft, photography,    
{swimming and canoeing.}When this      
 period is over we change back into    
 uniform and form{patrols.}We let down 
 the{flag}and say a prayer before being
 dismissed. Finally we sweep up and    
 roll up the flag ready for the Falcons
 on Friday.
