    Most people I asked, said their    
 parents worked out of the area. So    
 people can't have a job. Eight of the 
 children  said their parents work out 
 of the area and they all need cars.   
 All the people who go to work all need
 cars because we have no regular bus   
 service or ferries.We have one private
 bus on Monday, it goes to Ledbury and 
 one on a Wednesday, it goes to        
 Gloucester.                           
         Most people go to work in     
 Gloucester or Tewkesbury because      
 Tewkesbury and Gloucester are the     
 nearest towns to Pendock. Ledbury is  
 also near but there are not very many 
 jobs there.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
