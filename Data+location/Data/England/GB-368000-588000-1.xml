 Much of the area covered by this grid 
 rectangle is taken up by forest and   
 water. Along the southern edge of the 
 block is{Kielder Water,} with the     
 northern end of the{Kielder Dam}just  
 included. This part of the shoreline  
 alternates between sandy inlets and   
 rocky promontories.                   
 The{Belling Crag}once towered some 90 
 feet from its base to its summit. Now 
 only the top 15 feet are exposed above
 the dark waters.                      
 The{Belling Burn}makes inroads into   
 the forest which now covers the rest  
 of the 12 square km. Wide forest rides
 are the only break in the tree cover. 
 One of Northumberland's last remaining
{drift mines} still operates in the    
 forest, about 1km north west of the   
 North Abuttment of the dam.
