		<title>01ARTS &amp; CRAFTS, N CREAKE</title>
		<content> In recent years, N Creake has become  
 the village of talented incomers.     
 Perhaps it is the special quality of  
 East Anglian light, together with a   
 high and isolated situation that      
 appeals to these people.              
 These include a documentary film      
 maker, a water-colour artist, and a   
 producer of special greetings cards.  
 The former school building now houses 
 a small firm making three dimensional 
 puzzles, that sell world-wide.        
 A pine kitchen-craft business has been
 started in farm buildings.            
 A quarterly magazine is edited and    
 produced by a lady who came to live   
 locally, and saw a need for a news    
 letter.  It has developed well beyond 
 that point with articles and line     
 drawings by its readers.  It is       
 distributed free, to all homes in     
 North and South Creake.               </content>
