		<content> For school I wear a skirt, a T-shirt  
 and a jumper. In the summer I come in 
 a dress or skirt and change into a    
 PE-skirt or shorts. A PE-skirt is one 
 that is not as long as a normal skirt.
 With this I wear a T-shirt.           
 In winter I wear jeans and a jumper. I
 come in wellies when the weather is   
 bad. For summer I wear shoes or       
 trainers. For summer underwear I wear 
 pants and ankle socks. I wear vest,   
 pants and tights in the winter.       
 My hobby is Guides. I wear a blue     
 blouse and skirt, a red tie and a blue
 hat, any coat and black shoes. For a  
 disco I wear a short skirt that is    
 joined on to a baggy jumper.My best   
 outfit is jeans, a jumper and         
 trainers.
