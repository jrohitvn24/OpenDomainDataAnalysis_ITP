		<title>05Employment in Sedlescombe</title>
		<content> The number of people employed within  
 this area is steadily decreasing with 
 changes in agricultural methods and   
 the closing down of small industries. 
 There is a seasonal rise in the       
 numbers employed on the farms as the  
 fruit ripens, and this is usually     
 women and students.                   
 Many people from the village commute  
 to Hastings, Battle, Bexhill, London, 
 Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne. A few 
 local firms attract workers from      
 Sedlescombe and Whatlington as well as
 from further afield. These include    
 local builders, light engineering,    
 garages, a charcoal burners and a     
 swimming pool builders. The few local 
 shops generally employ local people.  
 Local hotels and restaurants bring in 
 outside workers as well as calling on 
 local casual labour.
