Cheadle is a small market town in the  
Staffordshire Moorlands.It has a       
population of app.10,400.In recent     
years several new Estates have been    
built &amp; the population has increased.  
Local Industry(chiefly light           
engineering),Boltons Copper Works,     
Cheadle CWSO &amp; Alton Towers provide    
some jobs but the town is mainly       
dependent on Stoke for job             
opportunities.The growth of the        
shopping centre has been restricted by 
the proximity to Stoke but the shops &amp; 
Market(Tue.Fri.&amp;Sat.)serve many of the 
needs of the town &amp; surrounding rural  
area.There is traffic congestion owing 
to Alton Towers traffic but parking is 
adequate &amp; free.The town has Parks,    
Play areas &amp; Games facilities + Sports 
Hall,Pool &amp; Leisure Centre. It is in   
close proximity to lovely countryside. </content>
