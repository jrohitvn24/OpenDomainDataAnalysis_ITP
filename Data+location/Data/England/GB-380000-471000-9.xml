		<title>09Houses of Horton</title>
		<content> Housing in Horton is all of good      
 quality and well maintained. There are
 houses from all periods from the late 
 17th Century onwards, including late  
 19th Century terraced cottages built  
 for railway and quarry workers and a  
 number of terraced and semidetached   
 houses built during the first part of 
 the 20th Century.  Since 1945 a number
 of bungalows have been added some     
 council built and some private.  Most 
 houses, except for some of the        
 terraced cottages, have gardens.  Many
 houses do not have garages.  Everyone 
 has an internal bathroom and toilet.  
 Domestic heating is by open fires     
 and/or central heating systems.       
 There is no piped gas;  users must    
 rely on propane gas stored in tanks on
 the premises.  One or two houses are  
 converted from barns.
