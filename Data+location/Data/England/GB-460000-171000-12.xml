		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> This is 11 year old Suzanne Stokes    
 account of what she did on 8th July   
 1985. I got up at 07:30 and got       
 dressed, washed my sister's hair and  
 had breakfast. I then made my         
 sandwiches for lunch and did the      
 washing-up. At school I did some      
 percentages in maths and then my      
 project. After break I did some       
 English work about Buckingham Palace. 
 Afterwards I saw the Headmaster about 
 some projects. After lunch I finished 
 my English and did some geography,    
 which was about a map, and then went  
 home. I tidied my desk and room at    
 home, read a book and then had some   
 tea. After tea I did some of my       
 individual project, which is about    
 farms. Then I watched television. At  
 21:00 I went to bed.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
