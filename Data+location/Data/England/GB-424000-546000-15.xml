		<title>15What's in a Name- Sacriston</title>
		<content>      {       SACRISTON}               
                                       
     The land around Sacriston was once
 owned by the Bishop of Durham. During 
 the 13th Century the estate was given 
 to the{Sacrist}of Durham Cathedral by 
 Bishop Pudsey.                        
     The{Sacrist}was a monk whose job  
 it was to provide everything necessary
 for the services in the Cathedral ie  
 bread, wine and vestments. He was also
 required to feed 200 people on St     
 Catherines Day - giving each a loaf   
 and two herrings.                     
     The funds for carrying on the     
 business in the Lands of the Sacrist  
 came principally from the estate      
 called Sacriston Heugh ( pronounced   
 Seggerston Heuff ).                   
     The monks were mining coal in this
 area as long ago as 1321.
