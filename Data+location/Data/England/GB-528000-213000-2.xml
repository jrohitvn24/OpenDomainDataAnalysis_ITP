		<title>02SELE FARM ESTATE-2</title>
		<content>  Nearly all the gardens on the estate 
 are kept beautifully &amp; so are the     
 allotments.                           
   For entertainment on the estate the 
 Golden Griffin public house is used by
 the people living nearby &amp; by people  
 living elsewhere in the Hertford.     
 Nearly every house has a television   
 aerial which suggests that a lot of   
 people watch television for           
 entertainment.  There are play areas  
 for the children but many of the older
 ones attend the youth clubs which are 
 held in the Sele School Youth Wing.   
 Adults &amp; families use the Community   
 Centre.  Schooling is well catered for
 on the estate.  There is a junior     
 school, St.Andrews, and a secondary   
 school, Sele School.                  
    The people in the old folks' home  
 are well looked after.  The Sele Farm 
 Estate is a caring community.         </content>
