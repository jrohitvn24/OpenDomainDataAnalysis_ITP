		<title>02Mixed Farming, N.Alcester</title>
		<content>      Among the 10 farms in this area  
 there is considerable variety, so that
 farming can truly be regarded as      
 'mixed'.                              
      On the farms among the Alne Hills
 crop cultivation is the most important
 activity, with winter wheat and barley
 predominating. Here animals are kept  
 only in small numbers, although Dingle
 Farm has a flock of 120 sheep and 100 
 poultry.                              
      Further south and west land is   
 lower and nearer to the rivers Alne   
 and Arrow. The presence of heavy clay 
 has necessitated drainage work. Here  
 the land is more suitable for cattle  
 rearing. Two farms of several hundred 
 acres have beef and dairy herds. Grass
 and barley are grown for fodder and   
 there is a substantial amount of      
 pasture. One other farm is entirely   
 dairy and another has cows and sheep. </content>
