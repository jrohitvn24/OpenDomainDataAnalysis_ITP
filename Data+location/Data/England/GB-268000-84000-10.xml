		<title>10FARMING (i)</title>
		<content> Farming is the main industry of the   
 area. Shapley has 1,200 acres if      
 moorland grazing is included;but most 
 farms are less than 100 acres and run 
 on a family basis. Mixed farming is   
 the general rule;beef cattle, sheep,  
 poultry, hay and silage and root crops
 for winter feed. There is little dairy
 farming.One newcomer at Buda is now   
 farming sheep and beef,having been put
 out of business as a milk farmer by   
 the EEC quota system.Breeding for     
 beef,aiming for size and quality, uses
 chiefly Charolais or Limousin crossed 
 Hereford .The calves run with the     
 mothers for 8 months,then are         
 weaned.Cows calve again within 4      
 months. Bullocks may be sold at       
 Chagford autumn cattle markets (Aug.  
 and Nov.) or wintered indoors to fetch
 higher prices in spring,to be balanced
 against the cost of feeding.          </content>
