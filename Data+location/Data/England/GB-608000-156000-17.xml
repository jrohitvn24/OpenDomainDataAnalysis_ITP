		<title>17 Micro Cars</title>
		<content>A sign of the recent concern over the  
rising cost of petrol and private cars 
is the recent development of a small   
factory in Dunkirk making a            
micro-vehicle.The building used to be a
filling station but the new by-pass    
took trade away.The small vehicles are 
easy to drive,economic to run and can  
be driven by 16 year olds and over.The 
Company was named the 'Moped Cursor    
Cars Company'.The cars would sell at   
about 1700 pounds.Mind you, the cars   
have no roof,no doors,a windscreen,a   
window at the back and only three      
wheels - 2 at the front and 1 at the   
back.They do not have a reverse gear,so
the owner has to push his vehicle back-
wards if necessary!A motor bike engiine
is fitted.The Sinclair C5,the world's  
first mass produced battery powered    
car,has been a recent commercial       
failure.But 1 has been seen hereabouts.</content>
