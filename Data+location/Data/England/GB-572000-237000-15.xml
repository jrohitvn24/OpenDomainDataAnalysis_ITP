		<content> Parents of children attending Toppes- 
 field School and living within the    
 block were questioned about transport 
 and employment.Few local employment   
 opportunities exist and,as public     
 transport facilities are extremely    
 sparse,a high degree of personal mob- 
 ility is required.Most families which 
 responded comprised 2 adults, plus    
 children.All had at least one car and 
 40% had 2 vehicles.Five of the 30     
 working adults travelled over 50 miles
 to work and 3 had mobile jobs.A furth-
 er 11 people worked from home or with-
 in walking distance. The survey method
 inevitably reflects the life style of 
 younger families; many retired people 
 have no personal transport whatsoever.
 51% of adults questioned were in      
 whole-time employment, 22% had part-  
 time work and the remainder, mainly   
 mothers,had no paid jobs.             </content>
