		<title>07Oldham Batteries.</title>
		<content>   Oldham Batteries is an established  
 Denton company having originally set  
 up a factory here in 1865.Initially it
 produced machinary for the hatting    
 industry.The company was family run   
 until the early 1970's when it was    
 taken over the by Hawker Siddeley     
 group.                                
   Presently it produces not only car  
 batteries but also batteries used by  
 the Ministry of Defence.These must be 
 rugged,have a long shelf life,be ready
 for instant action and be reliable as 
 they are used for activating missiles.
 A recent development for the mining   
 industry are methalarm lamps these    
 flash automatically when unacceptable 
 levels of methane are present.        
   There are Oldham's depots nationwide
 and it is not unusual to see their    
 name in many countries as 25% of their
 product is exported.                  </content>
