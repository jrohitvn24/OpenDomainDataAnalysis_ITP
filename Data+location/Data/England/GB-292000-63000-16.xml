		<title>16A child's Sunday.</title>
		<content>      I start the day with a sluggish  
 run of about two and a half miles     
 followed by a light breakfast.I then  
 walk to my friend's house for a lift  
 to Church.I am a Pentecostal.This     
 means that you believe in gifts of the
 Spirit and I go to an Assemblies of   
 God church.The morning meeting usually
 begins with much singing,dancing and  
 clapping.There are maybe two hymns,   
 Communion and a time of open prayer,  
 praise and worship.During this time   
 people wait on their gifts and give   
 messages in tongues.These are then    
 interpreted by others.After dinner at 
 my friend's house we listen to records
 or take a short walk.In the evening   
 the little church is usually full half
 an hour before the meeting starts.Then
 everyone goes crazy.There's more time 
 for praise.It's great.I arrive home,  
 thoroughly exhausted at 9 o'clock.    </content>
