  Our block is an attractive part of   
 the Cotswolds. The Northern half is a 
 tree covered valley while the Southern
 part is composed of well cultivated   
 fields. We have two and a half        
 villages on our block. one is         
 Sapperton, the other is Frampton      
 Mansell and we cover half of Oakridge.
 The main road from Stroud to          
 Cirencester covers the Southern part  
 of our block, running through some of 
 the cultivated fields. Some of the    
 fields have cattle or sheep in them.  
 The villages of Sapperton and Frampton
 Mansell are older than our half of    
 Oakridge. They are both mentioned in  
 the Domesday Book of 1086. The whole  
 area is popular with visitors who seek
 out its quiet rural beauty.
