		<content> Alexandra Palace "the palace of the   
 people "was originally built in 1875, 
 6 weeks later the palace burnt down.  
 It was rebuilt and became a place     
 where people went to exhibitions and  
 leisure events.                       
 In 1980 fire struck again and         
 destroyed much of the main palace .   
 In order to provide a site for        
 exhibitions the present pavillion was 
 erected.The pavillion has the capacity
 for 4,000 people. It has a usuable    
 area of 3,620 sq metres with a height 
 of 14 metres. It cost 5,000 a day to  
 hire and provides a place suitable    
 for many different types of events    
 and functions. Medium sized           
 exhibition both trade public meetings 
 and conferences. Also it is an        
 excellent setting for sports such as  
 gymnastics, boxing, wrestling and
