		<content> We had been told that Henry Ford said 
 you can any colour car you like       
 provided its black.As it was a nice   
 day we went to the fly over road on   
 the A1.We did the survey from 1115 to 
 1135 BST.Different groups looked at   
 the Southbond and Northbound traffic. 
 We were able to note car registrations
 and using an old Automobile           
 ,Association Handbook (1959-60), find 
 out where cars and trucks were        
 registered.                           
   The four most popular colours were:-
