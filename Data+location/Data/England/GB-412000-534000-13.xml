		<title>13Roddymoor &amp; surrounding area</title>
		<content> Roddymoor was built so that the men   
 who worked on the railway line and    
 down the mines in the area had        
 somewhere to live, near to their place
 of work. When the mines and the       
 railway that served it closed down the
 area was used as a site for a chemical
 works.However this to closed down and 
 the Open Cast moved in.               
 The area around Roddymoor was one of  
 the first to be mined and has now     
 being restored and put back to        
 grass.There are few trees in the      
 region because they were pulled out   
 when the land was opencasted.         
 There is a playing field near the     
 houses which are mainly terraced with 
 a General Store and Post Office       
 combined.                             
 The farms in the area are mainly Dairy
 with herds of Jersey cows while the   
 sheep were Scottish black face breed. </content>
