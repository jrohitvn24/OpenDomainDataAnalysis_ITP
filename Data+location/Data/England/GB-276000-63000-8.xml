		<content> We visited this wood to look at the   
 many varieties of conifers that have  
 been planted here,including some giant
 redwoods over 40m high .However we    
 found the iron age earthworks, which  
 was excavated by archeologists in 1965
 .They found 3 enclosures inside which 
 were the wooden huts of a village.The 
 ditches and banks are still easily    
 seen.The construction was made by     
 Britons about 200 to 400AD and the    
 fertile soil would have yielded good  
 crops .With no trees then they would  
 have had a splendid view down the     
 River Dart for greater security.This  
 site was lived in both before and     
 after the Roman invasion and this     
 makes it a most unusual monument.
