 In Marston there is a village shop and
 post office, however there are no     
 other shopping facilities in either   
 village.                              
 90% of the people living in the area  
 use both the village shop and the     
 larger shops in Grantham and Newark.  
 5% of the people never use the village
 shop and about 5% use solely the      
 village shop.  These are mostly the   
 housebound and elderly.  A lot of     
 people use the village shop whilst    
 collecting their pensions and family  
 allowances.  Children help the        
 business because there is a good sweet
 counter.                              
 Many people shop by mail order        
 catalogue.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
