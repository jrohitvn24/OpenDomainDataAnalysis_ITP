 Centre in 1978 and a group of people  
 from Sawston bought some very old

     Mrs Catterick thought to her self 
 she would like to play{handbells.

 to do was to get a group and raise    
 some money,to order some{handbells.

     The very first time the{Fenbells  
{performed in public}was here at the   
{Fenstanton School Fete on the 6th of  
{June 1980.

 her set of Fenbells and now she has   
 got{25 handbells.}The smallest bells  
 cost about{Â£90}and the biggest bell   
 cost about{Â£200.
