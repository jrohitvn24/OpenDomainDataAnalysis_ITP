		<content> Sheep are also raised in Golden       
Cross. They are kept in a grazing      
field near to the church in small      
quantities and are also sold in        
Hailsham and Lewes. There are other    
profitable sidelines in the area. Many 
farms keep a few chickens in a small   
field and sell the eggs produced as    
Â£free range eggs' and can sell them at 
a higher price. There is itensive      
animal farming in the area and the     
animals are well treated. The soil in  
the area is very good for farming.     
It is not very rocky and is flat so    
machines can be used easily. It is     
very rich in vital nutrients and very  
little fertilizer has to be used       
which lowers the cost per acre. Overall
the farming is arable and the site is  
very good for farming.
