		<title>01Redditch New Town.</title>
		<content>{Redditch}was designated a{New Town}in 
{1964}and was planned as a series of   
 selfcontained "neighbourhoods".{Church
{Hill}and{Winyates}are within our area.
 Houses and factories have been built  
 to follow the lines of the landscape. 
 Redditch has a road system built to   
 link the estates with the town centre 
 and beyond to{Birmingham}and the{M5   
 motorway at{Bromsgrove.}Redditch has  
 the covered{Kingfisher Shopping Centre
 and a pedestrianized area, with access
 for the disabled around the dominant  
{St. Stephen's Church.}Each estate has 
 an industrial area, a local shopping  
 centre and schools. Over 700 acres    
 have been set aside for the{Arrow     
{Valley Park}and a conservation area at
{Ipsley Alders Marsh.}As much of the   
 natural landscape has been preserved  
 as possible and over 3 million new    
 trees planted.                        </content>
