		<content> Mr.Bryce the church warden told us    
 about the Church.The church was built 
 in 1862-63 in an early English style  
 dedicated to St.Paul.The Bishop of    
 Durham &amp; the Crown are the patrons of 
 the church.The 1st vicar of St.Pauls  
 Church was Charles Edward Palmer.On   
 the 29th of December 1907 there was a 
 fire at the church which almost       
 desroyed it.It was rebuilt and        
 reopened on the 23rd of March 1909.A  
 feature of the church is its          
 peculiarly shaped roof.It is shaped   
 like the bottom of a boat and lined   
 with wood.The stained glass windows at
 the front of the church show pictures 
 of Jesus sowing seeds,knocking at a   
 door and guarding sheep.The organ     
 which is in the church was built by   
 Brindly and Foster of Sheffield.It was
 originally put into St.Peebles church 
 in Scotland and then sold to St.Pauls.</content>
