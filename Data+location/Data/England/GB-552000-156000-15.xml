		<title>15The Vestry Estate</title>
		<content>The estate was established to provide  
work and generate wealth following the 
decline of the railways, brickworks and
agriculture after the Second World War.
It is administered by a private company
based in Sidcup and was part of a plan 
covering many similar parts of the     
country.  The estate can be said to be 
successful in that it provides premises
for over 40 industrial units, including
Telecommunications, data processing,   
printing, motor factors, machine tool  
manufacturers, plastics and tile makers
and storage and distribution depots,   
all of which provide for unskilled and 
skilled workers, both manual and white 
collar.  Many users of the estate      
complain that they cannot attract      
skilled workers because of the high    
cost of housing.  Others hope that the 
new M25 will solve some of the         
distribution problems encountered.     </content>
