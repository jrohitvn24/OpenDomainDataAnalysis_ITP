		<title>04Housing in Kirk Sandall</title>
		<content> The houses in this part of Kirk       
 Sandall are known locally as "Pilk's  
 houses".This is because they were     
 built by{Pilkington brothers},glass   
 manufacturers,to house the workers    
 from their new factory which came to  
 Kirk Sandall in 1920.Over 2,000 houses
 were planned for the new{"Garden      
{Village"}along with many other        
 amenities.However by 1923 the plant at
 the new works had become obsolete and 
 the driving force behind the village  
 had been lost and Pilkington's began  
 to sell the houses. Some 500 houses   
 were built and of the amenities which 
 were provided the{bowling greens and  
{pensioner's club}are still enjoyed    
 today. Kirk Sandall is no longer a    
 company village but a commuter suburb 
 for Doncaster.
