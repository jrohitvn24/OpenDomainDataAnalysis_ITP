		<content>    Built in 1938 the school, a        
 comprehensive taking over 600 pupils  
 of all abilities aged 11-16, has a    
 large catchment area. Pupils come from
 primary schools at Benwick, Manea,    
 Doddington, Wimblington and the King  
 Edward School in Chatteris. A large   
 number of pupils have to be taken to  
 and from the school by buses. The     
 school previously operated a transfer 
 system at 13 to the Neale Wade School 
 in March. Since September, 1983 the   
 system has been reorganised and the   
 transfer no longer takes place.       
    Pupils can work towards a full     
 range of CSE and GCE subjects in their
 final year. For further qualifications
 they must travel to March or Wisbech. 
    The facilities for craft and       
 science have been extended and there  
 is a new sports hall which is also    
 used by the public.                   </content>
