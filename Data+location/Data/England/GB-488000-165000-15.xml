		<content>   There are a number of{problems}that 
 the foresters have to face.  These    
 include{vandalism}to the buildings and
 trees, and also the risk of{fire.}    
 Each year approximately ten acres of  
 trees are lost, and in 1976 50 acres  
 were destroyed by fire. {Insect pests}
 include the Pine Shoot beetle and the 
 Great Spruce Bark beetle.  In the     
 fight against these pests, the manager
 uses as few{chemicals}as possible     
 because of the risks to wildlife and  
 to the urban population, and the      
 possibility  of polluting local       
 streams.                              
                                       
   The forestry{industry}is a          
 profitable one and the Sawmill is due 
 to expand in the next ten years with  
 the addition of another Windsor Estate
 Sawmill.  It is also to have a timber 
 treatment plant within the period.    </content>
