		<title>09Conservation in Ringland</title>
		<content>      The owner of{Taverham Hall Farm  
 has kept most of the field boundaries 
 and has repaired farm buildings rather
 than replace them. They have entered a
 competition for conservation and have 
 high hopes of winning both locally and
 nationally. Half the estate is farmed,
 the rest is woodland &amp; marsh. If trees
 die they are replaced. When crops need
 spraying he uses special sprays. A bee
 keeper has to remove his bees from the
 oil seed rape before it is sprayed.   
     This is a relatively unspoilt area
 The river and disused gravel pits home
 many water birds. Flocks of geese eat 
 on water meadows. In woods shy birds  
 like the hawfinch live.The nightingale
 returns in far less numbers than once.
 One old local remembers when they were
 shot because of their 'infernal din.' 
 Roe deer and foxes have been sighted. 
 Otter have been hunted in the past.   </content>
