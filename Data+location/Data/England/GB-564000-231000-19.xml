		<title>19MOBILE SERVICES</title>
		<content> Although the nearby villages have     
 modest shopping facilities,the people 
 in the survey area are very grateful  
 for the few mobile shops that serve   
 them.From Steeple Bumpstead,about     
 twelve kilometres from the centre of  
 the area,a baker's van calls,not only 
 supplying bread,but a good selection  
 of groceries too.The driver is a      
 cheerful young man who must brighten  
 up the day for the housebound.Once a  
 week a greengrocer calls.His base is  
 in Saffron Walden,fifteen kilometres  
 away.With a toot from his horn,his    
 customers come out to his van.There is
 a first class selection of vegetables,
 and fruit to choose from,eggs too.He  
 also has a display of fresh fish,many 
 kinds. These are all important ingre- 
 dients for a healthy diet, especially 
 for people in areas where the opport- 
 unities for shopping are limited.     </content>
