		<title>08THROWLEY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Throwley Church was built in the 13th 
 century. It has been extended many    
 times since then. It is the largest   
 parish in the area.                   
   The church is a meeting place for   
 Christian people. There are actually  
 23 on the electoral role. Some of     
 these serve on the Parochial Church   
 Council to organise the work of the   
 church. The main officers are the     
 chairman (Rev Russell), secretary,    
 treasurer and two church wardens.     
   There is a service every Sunday at  
 varying times, and there are also     
 baptisms, weddings and funerals from  
 time to time.                         
   Efforts are made to raise money for 
 essential repairs to the building. The
 parish also supports the work of the  
 church throughout the world.          
   The vicar is also in charge of three
 other rural parishes.                 </content>
