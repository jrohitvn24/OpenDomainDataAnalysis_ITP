		<title>07Employment in Herm</title>
		<content> For thirty-six years the island has   
 been run and administered by one      
 family, the Woods. All employment in  
 Herm is involved in the running of the
 island and its upkeep, tourism or     
 farming.                              
 Although small, the population covers 
 the whole range of employment and     
 essential services. The resident      
 population of about forty is          
 supplemented in the summer months by  
 about sixty extra staff who take care 
 of the 100,000 people who visit the   
 island every year.There is usually no 
 problem obtaining staff either        
 permanent or seasonal, and many       
 seasonal workers return year after    
 year.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
