		<title>12CHARLTON THEATRE</title>
		<content> In 1979 several of us decided to stage
 a pantomime centred on the destruction
 by speculators and planning           
 departments of North Dorset County    
 Council of the historic site at       
 Clayesmore,in conjunction with the    
 projected development of the village. 
 Although a total failure in stopping  
 villagers acceding to the North Dorset
 Plan"Snow White" managed to blend a   
 group of over 5OO children and adults.
 These have developed the theme from   
 past village life to the suburban     
 nonentity of the village now,with its 
 commuter population and dormitory     
 wealth.Productions include Bartholomew
 Fayre;Beauty&amp;the Beast;Noah;Moby Dick;
 Birdbrain;A Change of Life;Punch&amp;Judy 
 (according to Cruickshank).The Theatre
 raises money from local sponsorship   
 and insists on professional production
 if amateur acting.                    </content>
