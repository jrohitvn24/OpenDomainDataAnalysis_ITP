		<title>13Housing in Felixstowe</title>
		<content>    The new houses in Felixstowe are   
 mainly built with red bricks.Nowadays 
 the windows are smaller because it was
 found that the houses with large      
 windows lost a lot of heat in the     
 winter.New private housing estates are
 being built on the outskirts of       
 Felixstowe and Trimley St.Mary.       
    The houses,bungalows have 2,3 or 4 
 bedrooms cost between Â£30,000 and     
 Â£60,000.Council housing is increasing 
 due to expanding population with the  
 dock.Most houses nowadays have central
 heating fuelled by gas,oil or         
 electricity.To reduce heat loss some  
 windows are either double glazed or   
 secondary glazed.
