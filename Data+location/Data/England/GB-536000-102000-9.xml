 Our area which takes in Rottingdean,  
 East Ovingdean, Saltdean and the      
 southern tip of Woodingdean is        
 dominated by the Downs. The           
 residential areas had their beginnings
 in the valley where Rottingdean is    
 situated, the only natural valley     
 between Brighton and Newhaven. Large  
 areas are farmland. From the Beacon   
 Hill windmill one can see how the     
 residential areas have spread. North  
 of Rottingdean and Saltdean the Downs 
 are also untouched.  The housing in   
 this area is varied in style, dating  
 from the 16th century in Rottingdean  
 to the newer bungalows on the hills at
 Woodingdean and Saltdean.
