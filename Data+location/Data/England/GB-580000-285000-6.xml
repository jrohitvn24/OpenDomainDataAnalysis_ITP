		<title>06WORKING IN SANTON DOWNHAM</title>
		<content> The only employment locally is with   
 the F.C. or the three tenanted farms  
 in the area. The farms are basically  
 arable and grow mostly carrots and    
 sugar beet; a small number of cattle  
 are grazed on a few acres by the      
 river. Other jobs are in Brandon,     
 Thetford or other local towns.        
 Until about 10 years ago, flint was   
 still being worked for gun flints.    
 Although the knapping was done in     
 Brandon, the flint was quarried in an 
 area near Lingheath and traces of pits
 can still be found in the S.W. corner 
 of the block.
