		<title>13A SATURDAY IN CHURCHDOWN</title>
		<content>  On Saturday 15th June 1985 I got up  
 early unlike most Saturdays.I had     
 toast and honey and a glass of milk   
 for breakfast.Next I called for my    
 friend and we came home and washed my 
 dad's car. We washed it with soap then
 we hosed it down.Then my friend went  
 home and my dad took us to Grandma's  
 who lives near us in Churchdown.We    
 stayed there for lunch and then helped
 Granma in her garden.                 
  At 3:30 we went home and I practised 
 my piano and clarinet ready for my    
 lesson.Then I had tea:beans on toast  
 and ice-cream.After tea I watched T.V.
 and then I fed the goldfish.Then I    
 brushed my teeth and put on my pyjamas
 and at 7:30 I went to bed.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
