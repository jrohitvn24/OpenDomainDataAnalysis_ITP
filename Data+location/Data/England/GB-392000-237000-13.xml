		<content> Once a year,early in July,we hold our{
{School Sports Day.}We all go over to  
 the Playing Fields to race.Our        
 families are usually there waiting to 
 watch us and cheer us on.We sit down  
 on mats waiting to begin.We are       
 divided into groups of 5 to 7 for the 
 events.We have a Slow Cycle Race,High 
 Jump,Running Races,Skipping Races,    
 Parents'and Toddlers'Races,Obstacle   
 Races,Egg and Spoon Races and Sack    
 Race.If we come 1st,2nd or 3rd we get 
 a rosette.At the end of the afternoon 
 we all gather together around a table 
 and the person who has done best is   
 awarded a cup.Other cups are awarded  
 for various other things.We then take 
 all the mats and equipment back to    
 school.We have ice-cream and other    
 refreshments on the lawn to cool us   
 down.
