		<title>05Shopping Centres, SE Derby</title>
		<content> The Allenton shopping centre is one of
 the largest suburban shopping centres 
 in Derby with over sixty shops. It is 
 built on a linear pattern with shops  
 facing the Osmaston road. Most of the 
 premises are converted houses although
 the supermarkets, hardware and some   
 smaller shops have newly built        
 premises.                             
   Food shops dominate the centre with 
 Fine Fare and the Co-op taking up     
 strong corner positions. A particular 
 feature of this centre is the good    
 selection of non-food shops including 
 furniture, hardware,ladies clothes,   
 optician and pet store.               
   In recent years the character of the
 centre has changed with the increase  
 in hot food take-away shops and the   
 incursion of businesses such as       
 solicitors, estate agents, insurance  
 offices and building societies.       </content>
