		<title>07JOBS IN WOODSPRING VILLAGES</title>
		<content> At one time practically all the       
 working population of villages such as
 Wick St. Lawrence or Kingston Seymour 
 were employed within the village      
 either on the farms or in businesses  
 connected with agriculture. Since the 
 Second World War farms have become    
 more mechanised and fewer men are     
 needed to work on them. Often only the
 occupier and family are needed. This  
 means that most people find jobs out- 
 side the villages in every walk of    
 life. The motor car has made this     
 possible. It has also meant that non- 
 villagers have been able to make their
 homes in the country to everyone's    
 mutual advantage. Moves to bring      
 employment to rural areas are resisted
 because the building of workshops     
 alters the character of a rural       
 community and puts a strain on roads  
 not designed for heavy traffic.       </content>
