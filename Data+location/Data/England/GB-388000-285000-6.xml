		<title>06THE AMBLECOTE AREA, CHANGES</title>
		<content>   {Amblecote}grew from a scattering of
 hamlets into a small industrial       
 township during the 19th century, this
 being the result of the industrial    
 revolution and the expansion and      
 development of its coal and clay      
 mining, its glass refactories and iron
 work industries.                      
    The present day{Peter's Hill}school
 is sited on the ground once occupied  
 by the{John Hall Works,}well known for
 the production of first class fire    
 bricks. From time to time they also   
 opened up pits which produced some    
 very good coal seams and good quality 
 house coal. Today all of this has     
 gone, to be replaced by large         
 modern, private housing estates,      
 altering the character of the area    
 considerably.
