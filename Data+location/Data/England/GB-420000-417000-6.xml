		<content> Whitley Lower C &amp; E (A) F &amp; M School  
 was built more than a hundred years   
 ago for the education of children from
 Whitley and Briestfield.  Over the    
 years its roll has fallen until today 
 only twenty children attend the       
 school.  This will fall even further  
 in September l985 when eight children 
 move to the local High School.  As    
 only two children are due to join the 
 school in the foreseeable future, one 
 in January l986 and one in September  
 l988, the educational viability of the
 school is called into question.  Is it
 possible for a two teacher school to  
 cover the whole curriculum between the
 ages of five and twelve ?  The        
 arguments will continue, but closure  
 seems inevitable.  If closure happens 
 then Whitley children will attend     
 Thornhill First School while          
 Briestfield will attend Upper Whitley </content>
