{   }Traditionally this part of the    
 country has never had hedge rows and  
 field boundaries as in other parts of 
 the countryside. This is because the  
 land is relatively "new", having been 
 reclaimed from the sea in relatively  
 recent times. However the farmers in  
 the area do plant trees  and hedges to
 provide a windbreak so that the       
 topsoil is not blown away. In this    
 area farmers are not going to take out
 any more hedges to make their fields  
 larger.
