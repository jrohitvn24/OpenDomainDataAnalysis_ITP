{School Clubs}                         
 After school on a Tuesday afternoon we
 have a Country Dancing Club. Our      
 teachers for the Country Dancing Club 
 are Mrs.Palfrey and Mr.and Mrs.Turner.
 Recently we went to Wells for a       
 country dancing festival. It was the  
 tenth year the festival had taken     
 place, but unfortunately we could not 
 dance because of the heavy rain. We   
 also have Netball, Football, Cricket  
 and Guitar Clubs.
