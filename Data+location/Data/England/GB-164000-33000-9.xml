		<title>09A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> I laid the table and my dad put       
 the porridge out. After breakfast     
 we got in the car. My mum drove it.   
 My dad stayed at home to keep the     
 dog and cat in and feed them. We      
 dropped Stephen, Derek and Esther     
 off at the bus stop. My mum then      
 took Debbie and I to school. While    
 we waited for the rest of the         
 children to come, we had a little     
 play. Soon we went in to work. Later  
 we went out to play again. My         
 friends and I played a{game of        
{spying.}We had a lot of fun playing   
 that. The bell went so we all had to  
 line up. Debbie was playing with      
 someone else. At home my mum was      
 probably{making bread}or doing the    
 ironing. My dad was at work. We went  
 in and did more school work until it  
 was dinner time.
