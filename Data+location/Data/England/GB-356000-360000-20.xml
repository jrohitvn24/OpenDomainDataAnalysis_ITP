		<content>   I get up at 7.45 am.when I am going 
 to school.Before I have my breakfast I
 watch either TVam.or a video film.Then
 I get washed and dressed.If I have the
 time I play some records before going 
 out to catch the school mini-bus,which
 I wait for by Tiverton Hall Farm.     
   When I get to{school}I play in the  
 yard with my friends until the whistle
 goes.We collect our hymn books,then go
 into the hall for{assembly.}After this
 we do{Maths}or{English}until playtime.
 Then we do more work until dinner time

 art,craft,games or write about one of 
 the television programmes we have     
 watched.                              
   School finishes at 3.40pm. and when 
 I get home I play with my friend John 
 until tea-time.After tea I sometimes  
 play again or I watch the television  
 until it is time for bed.             </content>
