		<content>   There are not enough children to    
 field a football side, but everyone is
 very good at joining in whatever games
 we play, and the older children don't 
 throw their weight about with the     
 little ones.                          
   The Headmaster has taught six boys  
 to dance the Morris, and they combine 
 with boys from Hermitage and Falkland 
 School in Newbury to make the Downs   
 Morris.  This year they performed at  
 four fetes.                           
   The school is surrounded by open    
 fields so we all know quite a lot     
 about birds and animals. On one       
 afternoon this term we counted up all 
 these on our playing field: 4 baby    
 rabbits, 2 baby owls, 2 squirrels, 8  
 jackdaws and 6 wood pigeons.  We      
 could'nt actually see the moles but we
 could see where they were digging.
