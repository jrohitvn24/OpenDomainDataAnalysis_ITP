		<title>19TVEI - WORK EXPERIENCE</title>
		<content>    My school, Tong Upper is one of the
 few schools which is pioneering the   
 Technical and Vocational Education    
 Initiative scheme.  Places are only   
 available for l50 pupils in any one   
 school year and are limited to the    
 fourth and fifth forms.               
   In the fourth year we spend two     
 separate weeks in the Work Experience 
 Unit. My form spent its first week    
 there after Christmas.We were divided 
 into five groups and we changed jobs  
 each day.  One day we worked in the   
 canteen and made morning coffee and   
 baked the biscuits which we sold to   
 pupils and staff.  We also prepared   
 the lunch for the whole form and some 
 staff.In the afternoon after washing  
 up we made some sweets. I spent a day 
 in the stores checking stock, another 
 day in reception and a day in         
 reprographics. I enjoyed all the work.</content>
