		<title>02Traveller's Guide to Bexhill</title>
		<content> Bexhill's{beaches}are very stoney and 
 there is very little sand. You can go 
 for very nice walks on Galley Hill on 
 the cliffs. On the{seafront}there is  
 the De La Warr Pavilion, the Bexhill  
 sailing club and angling club. The De 
 La Warr Pavilion was designed by the  
 Bauhaus architects Mendelsohn and     
 Chermayeff and opened in 1935. In it  
 there is a theatre which seats 1200   
 people, a ballroom, banqueting suite, 
 restaurant and sun terace. The sailing
 club is a new building on the beach   
 and has sailing races at the weekend  
 during the summer. There is a large   
 park called{Egerton Park}where you    
 can hire a boat and row on the pond.  
 The{shops}are mainly small and you    
 have to go to Eastbourne or Hastings  
 for the large stores.
