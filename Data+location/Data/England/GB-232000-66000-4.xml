		<content>      This striking hill of resistant  
 chert is the site of an{Iron Age hill 
{fort,}set up by peoples from Europe   
 in the 3rd and 4th centuries B.C.     
      The steep sides of up to 30      
 degrees and flat top made an ideal    
 site for{defence}in troubled times.   
 However, it is thought that there was 
 no permanent settlement on the hill   
 top: the people lived close to the R. 
 Lynher for{water supply,}and moved up 
 to Cadson Bury when danger threatened.
      The hill fort is classed as a    
{Defensive Earthworks with Single      
{Banks,}and the remains of the         
 earthworks can still be clearly seen  
 on the summit.  Most obvious is the   
{ditch}of up to 4m depth which rings   
 the hill for over 500m.               
      Cadson Bury, being of historical 
 interest, is now{National Trust       
 property.                             </content>
