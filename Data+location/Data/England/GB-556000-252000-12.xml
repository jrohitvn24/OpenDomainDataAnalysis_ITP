		<title>12West Wratting: Hedgerows</title>
		<content> Many hedgerows have been removed in   
 recent years which makes the landscape
 look rather stark but has improved the
 long distance views. Ely Cathedral,   
 which is twenty-five kilometres to the
 north, can be clearly seen silhouetted
 on the skyline from many points in the
 area. The rate of hedgerow removal is 
 slowing but is still continuing. The  
 reasons given by the farmers for the  
 practice of grubbing of hedgerows:-   
 a) removing rabbit cover              
 b) increasing light to field edges    
 c) less maintenance now little        
    livestock is kept.                 
 d) ease of handling large machines.   
 e) increased growing area.
