		<title>01ST MARYS TRAINING COLLEGE</title>
		<content> St Marys Roman Catholic College in    
 STRAWBERRY HILL near Twickenham was   
 founded in Hammersmith in 1850. It was
 moved to its present site in 1925. The
 former owner was a descendant of      
 Horace Walpole whose keen interest in 
 medieval architecture is prominent    
 throughout the house. The most recent 
 building project was completed in 1962
 and consisted of three new halls. The 
 college motto is MONSTRATE ESSE MATREM
 meaning BE A MOTHER TO US. At present 
 there is a staff of 120 and 1300      
 students, 400 of whom live on the     
 campus. The college offers a wide     
 range of courses in science, arts and 
 humanities right up to degree level   
 and beyond. Sports played by students 
 include karate, rugby, hockey,        
 cricket, netball, tennis, surfing and 
 football.
