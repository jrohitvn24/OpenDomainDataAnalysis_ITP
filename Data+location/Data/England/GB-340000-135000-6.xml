		<content> Colonel Tingey kindly explained to us 
 how local{government}works.The County 
 Council is based at{Taunton.}It has to
 take care of the Libraries, Museums,  
 Fire Services, Education, Police and  
 Schools.The District{Council}of which 
 Col. Tingey is a member, looks after  
 Housing, Planning, Leisure and        
 Recreation and Enviromental           
 Health.Parish Councils just raise     
 money for local causes.               
 Colonel Tingey has been on the Parish 
 Council for 15 years and on the       
 District Council for 12 years. He     
 belongs to the East Polden District   
 Council which takes care of Shapwick, 
 Ashcott, Moorlynch and Greinton. Now  
 that Col. Tingey is retired, a lot of 
 his time is spent as a councillor. He 
 prefers to work with{people}though,   
 rather than attending council         
 meetings.                             </content>
