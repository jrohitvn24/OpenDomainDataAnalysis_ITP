		<title>07DAY IN THE LIFE OF ALEX BELL</title>
		<content>My real name is Alexandra but I like to
be called Alex for short. I am a nine  
year old school girl and I have an     
older brother called Justin. I go to   
Geddington School. When I get up in the
morning I go downstairs and my mum     
makes the breakfast while I am watching
Popeye on television. Then I go back   
upstairs to get washed and dressed. I  
wear my school uniform. When I am      
finished I walk to school with my      
friend.                                
My teacher is Mrs Spooner who is very  
nice. We have 3 playtimes.             
After school I go home and watch the   
television. When I've eaten I get      
changed and call for Lucy. We usually  
go for a bike ride or go down to the   
brook. Then I go home, have my supper  
and watch television. Then I go to bed 
at 8.30pm.
