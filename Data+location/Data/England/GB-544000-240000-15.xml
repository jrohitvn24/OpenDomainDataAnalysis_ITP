		<content> There is concern about the expansion  
 of Stansted Airport, attracting       
 development and destroying peace and  
 quiet.  The village may have to expand
 due to the demand for more housing.   
 There is a general worry about the    
 economic state of the country.  The   
 disappearance of some hedges and trees
 concerns the conservationists         
 especially since the impact of Dutch  
 Elm disease.  Farmers are concerned   
 about future production - cereal crops
 are being overproduced.  They are     
 trying to diversify.  There is anxiety
 about children going out alone in     
 rural areas.  Lowering of the water-  
 table is of concern to people who rely
 on boreholes for their water supply.
