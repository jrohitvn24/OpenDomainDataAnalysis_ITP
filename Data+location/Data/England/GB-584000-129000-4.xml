		<title>04Houses in Rolvenden</title>
		<content>   There are about 600 dwellings in the
 parish of{Rolvenden.}About one third  
 of these were built by Tenterden Rural
 District Council and are now owned by 
 Ashford Borough Council. The remainder
 are privately owned.                  
   Most of the old houses were built in
 the 18th &amp; early 19th centuries. This 
 is because almost all of the houses in
 the village were burned down about 300
 years ago, following the Great Plague.
 The inhabitants moved to Lain Green,  
 which became{Rolvenden Layne.    }    
   Houses in the area are expensive to 
 buy. A 2-bedroomed cottage in a       
 terrace costs between Â£35,000 and     
 Â£50,000, while a 4-bedroomed detached 
 house costs between Â£65,000 &amp; Â£95,000.
   In the 1960's there was a special   
 housing development at Monypenny with 
 sheltered housing for old people. More
 old people live here than 10 years ago</content>
