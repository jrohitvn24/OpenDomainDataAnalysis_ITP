 The land falls from a sandstone ridge 
 in the west to an undulating area in  
 the east.  The farming landscape is   
 broken up by woods and coppices.  From
 Heath Hill are extensive views        
 westwards to Wales across Shropshire, 
 and to Cannock Chase in the east.     
                                       
 A large lake - the White Sytch, lies  
 in the SE.  It is surrounded by       
 private woodland where pheasants      
 breed.  The A41 bisects the block.    
 The land to the west is sloping       
 pasture land, while to the east is    
 mixed farmland crossed by high-hedged 
 lanes.  Sugar beet, Kale and cereals  
 are grown here.  Part of the village  
 of Sheriffhales lies in the SW corner,
 and other areas of housing are found  
 at Heath Hill and Great Chatwell.     
 Farms and cottages are scattered over </content>
