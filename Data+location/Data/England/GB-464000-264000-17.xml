		<title>17A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</title>
		<content>   Sir Patrick Mayhew lives at Twysden 
House. He is the Member of Parliament  
for the Tunbridge Wells Constituency.  
He is also the Solicitor General.      
Twysden House was built in 1485, the   
same year that Parliament was formed.  
   A General Election is held every    
five years unless the government lose  
support, when it will be sooner.       
People over 18 vote for new Members of 
Parliament. The main party in          
Parliament govern the Country.         
   There are two houses of             
parliament, the House of Commons and   
the House of Lords. The House of       
Commons is where the M.P.s meet. The   
House of Lords is where the Lords go.  
   Sir Patrick Mayhew's job is to tell 
the Government what the law is, so that
they do not break the law. As Member of
Parliament he helps people from the    
Constituency.                          </content>
