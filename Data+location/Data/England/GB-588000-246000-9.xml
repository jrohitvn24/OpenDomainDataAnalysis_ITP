use on some farms, no serious pollution
is said to occur. Anglia Water         
Authority states supplies in the area  
are not affected so far.               
                                       
The landowner with the largest agri-   
cultural holding burns all his straw.  
The second largest owner is involved in
animal husbandry as well as agriculture
and finds a use for most of his straw  
on his farms.

from crop spraying.
