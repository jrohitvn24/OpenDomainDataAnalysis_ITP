		<content> Pleasure{boating}is more important    
 than commercial transport on          
 Brentford's waterways. The{swimming   
 baths were opened in 1896. The baths  
 are not used much because there are no
 diving boards or infant facilities.   
 Brentford{Football}Club was founded in
 1889 by the Thames Rowing Club who    
 wanted another activity in the winter.
 They moved onto the present site in   
 1904. The ground was leased from      
 Fuller's Brewery. Brentford is now in 
 the 3rd Division but was in the 1st   
 Division from 1928 to 1936. Their best
 season was in 1936 when they came     
 fifth in the League, and in 1985 they 
 got to Wembley in the final of the    
 Freight Rover Trophy for 3rd and 4th  
 Division Clubs.The Club has a variety 
 of teams: First team, reserve team,   
 two youth teams, under 18, under 17   
 and a schoolboys' team.               </content>
