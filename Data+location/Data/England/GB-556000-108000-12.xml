		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SIMON</title>
		<content>   I'm  always the first to get up in  
 the morning. I get washed and dressed 
 and go downstairs to breakfast. I have
 'Start'the rest have 'Readibreak'then 
 I go to school. First we have Maths   
 then Assembly followed by play time.  
 After play its English and French.    
 After lunch play  we have Reading     
 then Games; some play cricket and     
 some play rounders. After last play we
 have Drama or Art, if we have finished
 our English!                          
   At 3.45 we go home. When I get home 
 I watch telly. My best programme is   
 Dallas but it is not on until 8       
 O'clock.Before that I watch Children's
 I.T.V. then go to Gregory's. We       
 sometimes go to play on the rope      
 swings in the wood. I come in at 7    
 O'clock and its only an hour to       
 Dallas. Then I go to bed.
