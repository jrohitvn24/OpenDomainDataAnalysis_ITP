		<title>01CRESWELL COLLIERY</title>
		<content> Creswell is the main settlement in our
 area. It was developed at the         
 beginning of this century when the    
 Bolsover Colliery Company established 
 a coal mine here. The sinking of the  
 first shaft started in 1894 and       
 Creswell Colliery started producing   
 coal in 1897.                         
 There are two shafts at the colliery. 
 No.1 shaft goes down to a depth of 300
 metres and is used for winding the    
 coal. No.2 shaft goes down to a depth 
 of 800 metres and is used for         
 manriding and materials only.         
 All current production is from the    
 Threequarter Seam and present output  
 is about 3,000 tonnes per day. The    
 average annual output is 700,000      
 tonnes of coal. Over 1,000 men are    
 employed at Creswell Colliery.
