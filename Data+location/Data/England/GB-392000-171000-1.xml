		<title>01GENERAL INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> This farming area of Wiltshire is     
 dominated by the eastern side of the  
 market town of{Chippenham}(population 
 just over 20,000).The area includes   
 the oldest part of the town around    
 the High Street and the Causeway just 
 east of where the main A4 London to   
 Bath road crosses the{River Avon.     
 The town has a railway station on the 
 London to Bristol line.Here is the    
 large factory of Westinghouse Brake   
 and Signal Company.                   
 There are several new housing         
 developments on the outskirts of the  
 town,but most of the area is given    
 over to medium sized{dairy farms.     
 The town has a large cattle market.   
 There is little woodland and the land 
 is generally flat at about 150 feet   
 above sea level.
