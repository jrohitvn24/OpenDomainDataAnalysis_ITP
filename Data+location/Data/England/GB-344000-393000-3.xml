		<content> Part of {PRESCOT }lies in our block.  
 The former boys'and girls' grammar    
 schools have combined to form a       
 comprehensive school called {PRESCOT  
{HIGH.}The {GAS WORKS }with its gas    
 holder also can be found just inside  
 the boundary.{PRESCOT }itself has a   
 long history.It has a church          
 supposedly haunted by a ghost;it is   
 famous for its watch and clock        
 industry which has now gone but there 
 is a fine museum;in the last century  
 a cable and wire manufacturing        
 industry has been established called {
{BRITISH INSULATED CALLENDER'S CABLES  
  or BICC for short;and a firm called  
{TINNLING'S }used to publish books     
 here.{PRESCOT }is part of the {       
{METRO.COUNTY of MERSEYSIDE }and as you
 would expect in these time there is a 
 great deal of unemployment.
