		<content>    The Royal Charter written by Henry 
 VIII has a seal on the bottom         
 depicting Henry VIII on both sides.   
 One side shows Henry on his horse.    
    The Priory has seven bedrooms, a   
 dining room, a sitting room, a        
 tapestry room and a drawing room, plus
 a large kitchen.                      
    Mrs Wagstaff is hoping to find the 
 remains of old graves where the nuns  
 were buried somewhere in the grounds. 
 The Wagstaffs own 130 acres of land   
 where they keep cows, sheep and crops.
    The Priory has three lakes.  In one
 of them lies the body of Margaret     
 Cheslyn who drowned.  The commonest   
 trees around the grounds are Beech,   
 Chesnut and Cedars and the owners have
 seen a badger, foxes, Stoats and      
 Weasels.
