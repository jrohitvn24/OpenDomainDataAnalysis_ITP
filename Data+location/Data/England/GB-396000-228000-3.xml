		<title>03Housing in Gotherington</title>
		<content> There are many different types of     
 houses in Gotherington.They have to be
 built in special Cotswold brick.The   
 oldest house is opposite Moat Farm.It 
 dates back to Elizabethan times.There 
 are also old houses which were part of
 the Gotherington Estate.Over the last 
 hundred years the village has         
 quadrupled in the number of houses it 
 contains.Most of the new houses have  
 been built between existing houses on 
 small plots of land.The most recent   
 building has been completed opposite  
 Moat Farm and by Ryman's shop.        
 You can buy a normal house for        
 Â£72000.A new bungalow would cost      
 about Â£80000.There are also some new  
 houses near the post office and the   
 butcher's shop. The old school is     
 being converted into two houses after 
 being sold for Â£50000 in February     
 1985.                                 </content>
