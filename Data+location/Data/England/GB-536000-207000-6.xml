		<title>06BROXBOURNE STATION</title>
		<content> Broxbourne Station is our local       
 railway station. It is on one of the  
 main lines into London. Local trains  
 travel between Bishop's Stortford and 
 Hertford East. Express trains travel  
 between London, Cambridge and Kings   
 Lynne. The new station was opened in  
 1960. The old station is about 100    
 metres away. 20 people work there;    
 three signalmen, five junior          
 railmen, two shunters, three senior   
 railmen, one station manager and two  
 others. The busiest times of the day  
 are between 7am and 9am, 4.45pm and   
 6.30pm. 180 trains call at the station
 daily. Trains are usually on time or  
 are delayed for a simple reason.      
 There are 10 level crossings on this  
 line. The station is open all year    
 except for Christmas day and Boxing   
 day.
