		<content>The 'Whitfield' family generally rise  
at 0730 and then half an hour later    
they have their breakfast of cereal and
toast. When the 2 children have been   
taken to school in the car, both       
parents then go off to work. At 1300   
hours, they have their lunch which is  
usually a main meal. The 'Whitfield'   
family have 2 pets. When the 2 children
get home from school, if it is Friday, 
the weekly shopping will probably be   
done. Before tea the children might go 
to the Village hall for some kind of   
club but are definitely back by 1800   
for their tea which is usually a snack.
After this they might play on the      
computer or watch the video. Before    
they goto bed at 2045 the children, if 
it is a Friday will be given their #1  
pocket money. They will soon be        
followed by the adults who usually go  
to bed at 2230.                        </content>
