		<content>{St.Mary's Church. Great Baddow.       
 St.Mary's Church is the oldest        
 building in Great Baddow.It is about  
{1,000 years}old.When the Domesday book
 was written in 1086 there was already 
 some kind of church there. Originally 
 the church was quite small.You can    
 still see where the church was first  
 built by the stone arches around the  
 centre part. There are commemorative  
 plaques to the dead of the First and  
 Second World Wars. We found the name  
 Matthams which belongs to two boys in 
 our school.There is an eagle lectern. 
 It is a stand from which people read  
 the Bible.On the walls of the church  
 there are memorial plaques on which   
 people's names are engraved.They are  
 people who worshipped in the church.
