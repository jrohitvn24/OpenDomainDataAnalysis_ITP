		<content>{A tenant farmer - Mr. Cooper}         
 Mr. Cooper has a mixed farm which     
 means that he has cereals and animals.
 The farm is called Court Farm because 
 the judicial court used to sit there. 
 He has about 416 acres and employs one
 man plus a student at harvest. He     
 likes farming and thinks it is a      
 worthwhile job. The farm is about 500 
 years old. He has lived there for 22. 
 Mr. Cooper and his employee work about
 ten hours a day. They have tractors,  
 combine harvesters, cultivating       
 machines and spraying equipment to    
 help them. The busiest times of the   
 year are autumn and spring; the rest  
 of the time it is quiet. The stock on 
 the farm is  mainly beef cattle and   
 Mr. Cooper breeds shire horses as a   
 hobby.
