		<title>09Taylor Industrial Estate</title>
		<content> Taylor Industrial Estate is on the    
 A574 Culcheth to Warrington road,     
 opposite the Glaziers Lane junction.  
    The Estate covers 22 acres. It was 
 opened in 1959 on land once owned by  
 the Admiralty. At present there are 40
 firms which together employ about 400 
 people. The firms are housed in units.
 The largest single unit has an area of
 56,000 square feet.                   
    We visited the site office and     
 spoke to Mr.Brian Taylor, whose family
 owns the Estate. His office has a     
 computer that stores information about
 the units, their owners and the rents.
    Most firms provide services like   
 meat packing, vehicle repair and book 
 storage. A few firms make products    
 like terrariums and metal castings.   
 Every company we asked about had      
 chosen the Estate because the M6 and  
 M62 motorways are nearby.             </content>
