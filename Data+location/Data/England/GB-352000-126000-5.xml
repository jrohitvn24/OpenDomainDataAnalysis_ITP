		<content>  The churches in the villages are     
 complementary to each other.CHARLTON  
 ADAM church is a small but beautiful  
 building,big enough for the ordinary  
 weekly services.It is enhanced by     
 paintings given to the church by the  
 late Mrs.Claude Neville.              
   CHARLTON MACKRELL church is a larger
 building,needed for the more important
 occasions.The building was drastically
 altered in Victorian times,gaining    
 wooden angels and losing its original 
 pulpit.In recent years much has been  
 done to improve the church,most       
 recently the reflooring of the Lyte's 
 Chapel.Due to the droughts of 1979 and
 1984,and to the presence of several   
 large lime trees in the churchyard,one
 wall is subsiding.A rescue effort is  
 under way,involving the raising of at 
 least Â£35,000.
