		<title>02Bredwardine; River Wye.</title>
		<content> The River Wye, here about 50 m. wide, 
 flows diagonally through the area from
 north-west to south-east. A feature is
 the large meander surrounding Brobury 
 on three sides; the river has eaten   
 away a deep cleft known as Brobury    
 Scar on the east side of the area.    
 This part of the river bank is heavily
 wooded, giving place to cultivated    
 fields in the central area and low    
 water-meadows to the west. The river  
 is subject to flooding, particularly  
 on the Bredwardine side. The Welsh    
 Water Authority, who administer the   
 area, have instituted a warning system
 which enables farmers to move their   
 livestock when danger threatens. The  
 river effectively separates           
 Bredwardine and Brobury, there being  
 only one crossing, at Bredwardine     
 Bridge.
