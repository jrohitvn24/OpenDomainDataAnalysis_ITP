		<title>05Ravensworth Castle</title>
		<content>   The ruins of the castle stand at the
 south end of the village, very near to
 the school. It is built on a small    
 mound surrounded by a marsh, which was
 originally a lake. The remains consist
 of one tower and a{14th cent.}gateway 
 and a few other fragments of building.
 It was demolished in the late{16th /  
 early{17th cent.}and has looked as it 
 does today since the late{18th        
{century.}                             
    The local villagers used the stones
 for building. The{Fitzhugh}family     
 owned it until the{16th cent.}One of  
 the family,{Akar,}founded{Jervaulx    
{Abbey}.In{1512}the family line came to
 an end and a cousin,{Lord Parr of     
{Kendal}inherited it. In{1571}it passed
 to the{Crown.}After that it had       
 numerous owners, until recently the   
{Craddocks,}the{ Jaffreys} and  now    
{Mr. Forest}of{Whorlton Hall.          </content>
