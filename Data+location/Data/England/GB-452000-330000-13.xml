		<title>13FARMING-FAIRHOLME FARM</title>
		<content>   On Thursday 20th of June,two boys   
 from Gotham School went to interview a
 farmer about his work.Fairholme Farm  
 is an arable farm of 420 acres and has
 been owned by the Howick family since 
 1947.Mr Howick has worked there for   
 the past 25 years,since leaving school
 at 15.They employ three full-time     
 workers and two more at harvest       
 time.They grow mainly barley and      
 wheat,but also some potatoes and peas.
 The farm has just acquired two new    
 large combine harvesters and they are 
 trying to sell their two smaller ones.
 They also use five tractors and       
 various attachments.                  
    In contrast,Gerald Taylor uses old 
 farming methods to work his 12 acres  
 of land.He uses 3 horses for ploughing
 and cultivating.He has built a gypsy  
 caravan,the interior of which is      
 beautifully hand-carved and decorated.</content>
