		<content>     There are 8 main farms in the     
 survey area and of these Weston Woods 
 is owned by Lord Vestey and run as    
 part of a business empire and Park    
 Farm is the home farm of West Wratting
 Park. Three farms within the area and 
 one on its southern border are moated 
 farms one of which dates back to Saxon
 times. The moats survive as tree-     
 filled depressions.                   
     The main crops are oilseed rape,  
 winter wheat, spring barley, beans    
 (for animals) and sugar beet. Very few
 animals are kept and most of the farms
 have an industrial appearance with    
 storage for large scale machinery and 
 crops.Farming is highly mechanised and
 the scale of combine harvesters and   
 other machinery favours large fields. 
 Many show signs of old field boundar- 
 ies where hedges and trees have been  
 removed.Most farms have some woodland.</content>
