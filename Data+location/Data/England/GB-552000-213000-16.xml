		<title>16A Typical Day in My Life</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up at 7.00 a.m.  
 and wash and dress before going down  
 for breakfast.  I normally have       
 cereal, toast and coffee.  After this 
 I clean my teeth and feed my rabbit   
 and guinea pig.  If there is time, I  
 do some piano practice.  I leave for  
 school at 8.20 because we go via      
 Bishops Stortford to take my brother  
 to school.  I live in Harlow but go to
 school in Hatfield Heath, which starts
 at 9.15.  After school, I sometimes   
 stay to one of the clubs like netball 
 or Cycle Proficiency and then my mum  
 picks me up.  When I get home, I      
 either watch television or go for a   
 bicycle ride with my older sister.  We
 have tea about 5.30 p.m. and          
 afterwards I read, play and do some   
 flute practice.  I go to bed on a     
 schoolday at about 8.30 p.m.          
                                       </content>
