		<title>01Introduction to the area</title>
		<content> The block is bounded to the west by a 
 well-used road and the edge of the    
 R.A.C. Tank Training area. To the east
 lies Wareham Forest with Forestry     
 Commission conifer plantations. Mostly
 low-lying between streams, it is rural
 in character. The lanes are narrow and
 the population sparse and scattered   
 among farms and small dwellings with a
 few larger houses and new bungalows.  
 Grassland supports dairy farmers, with
 some cereal and fruit growing. Some   
 small businesses, a gravel extraction 
 firm and a market garden are the only 
 industries. A golf-club, a priately   
 owned Youth Activity centre offer     
 leisure pursuits. There is an animal  
 sanctuary, a nature reserve and a site
 of special scientific interest.       
 Natural growth includes heathland,    
 bog, meadows, scrub and woodland.     
 There is a small Methodist Chapel.    </content>
