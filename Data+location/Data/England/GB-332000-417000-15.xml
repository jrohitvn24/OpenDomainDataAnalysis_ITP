		<content> Victoria was a girl of seven who lived
 in victorian times. Her father came   
 home drunk, decapitated her and her   
 mother, chopped them up and buried    
 them in the garden. When Littlewoods  
 was built on the site of the          
 graveyard, Victoria had no living     
 descendents to move her remains, so   
 she was left. She haunts the lift and 
 makes it stop for hours. There are    
 minor floods when the taps have to be 
 turned off with a monkey wrench, and  
 the children's shoes are taken out of 
 the stock bins every night. One size  
 only is taken out of the shoe boxes.  
 Another story from this area is about 
 the ghost of White Nancy which haunts 
 Meols Hall.She lived in the 18th      
 century and after being shipwrecked   
 was murdered by the Linaker family.   
 The only people to see her are        
 Linakers or those touched by them.    </content>
