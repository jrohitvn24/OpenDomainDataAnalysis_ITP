		<title>20THE FIRE STATION CLUB</title>
		<content>The Oxfordshire Fire Service is in two 
divisions A &amp; B. Didcot is in B        
Division, whose Headquarters are in    
Kidlington.  Didcot is not one of the  
3 fully-manned Fire Stations.  It is a 
3-day manned one.  There are three     
fire engines, including one for        
training. Over the years, firemens'    
work is more  complicated eg. a child  
may have something stuck on his or her 
finger, a head between bars, a foot    
behind a radiator or someone may be    
locked out.                            
The actual firemen are entitled        
members of the Fire Station Club, but  
other men and women pay 50p to obtain  
 embership.  Members are allowed to    
take their children.  In 1983, when    
 he Fire Station moved to its present  
 site on Broadway, it won the  Â£Best   
  Dressed Building' award - the        
Coronation cup.                        </content>
