		<title>13THE ARTS IN WHALTON</title>
		<content> The arts are well represented in this 
 rural area and the parish magazine,   
 representing five local churches, has 
 a cover designed by local artists. One
 of them is also a musician, Joy Scott,
 who has written several ballads about 
 her life as a farmer's wife at        
 Riplington.                           
 A retired painter, George Thompson, is
 a master of local dialect and his     
 neighbour was the author/naturalist,  
 Henry Tegner, who published more than 
 twenty_five books and, of course,     
 wrote much about this particular      
 district. His daughter, Veronica      
 Heath, carries on the tradition, has  
 several books published and is Country
 Diarist for Northumberland county in  
 The Guardian.
