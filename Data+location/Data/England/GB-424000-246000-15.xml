		<title>15ETTINGTON MEETING HOUSE</title>
		<content> The Society of Friends,or Quakers,have
 worshipped in Ettington throughout    
 their entire history and have suffered
 persecution and harassment at various 
 times in the past.Their meeting house 
 is one of the oldest buildings in     
 Ettington dating from 1681,and is now 
 a listed building.                    
 At present the rush wall covering is  
 being renewed.This is an ancient form 
 of insulation which though once common
 may now be unique.Also there are plans
 to extend the present single room     
 accommodation by adding toilet        
 facilities,a kitchen and children's   
 room.                                 
 Meetings are held on the first and    
 third Sunday of every month at        
 11.00 a.m.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
