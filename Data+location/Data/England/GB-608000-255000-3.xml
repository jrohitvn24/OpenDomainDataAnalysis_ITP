		<title>03A Child's Day in Creeting</title>
		<content>  I am a girl of seven years old and   
live on a fruit and vegetable farm.    
  I wake up at 7 o'clock, brush my     
hair, go downstairs and have           
breakfast. I usually have cornflakes   
or cocopops. Afterwards I brush my     
teeth and go to school by car.         
  When I get there I play in the play- 
ground until the bell goes. Then we do 
writing and Maths. Maths is measuring  
and adding and taking away.            
  Lunchtime is at 12 o'clock. We       
sometimes have potatoes and meat and   
vegetables.                            
  We play games after lunch and then do
more work, like Topic and Craft.       
  When it is time to go home we play on
the farm and then we go to get my      
sister from playgroup.                 
  Later on we have tea,brush our teeth 
and have a story. At bedtime I read,   
then count sheep before I sleep.       </content>
