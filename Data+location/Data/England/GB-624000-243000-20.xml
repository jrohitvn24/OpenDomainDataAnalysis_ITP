		<title>20SILVER-STUDDED BUTTERFLY.</title>
		<content>Martlesham Heath is one of the last    
strongholds in Suffolk of the rapidly  
declining silver-studded blue butterfly
In July 1985 Suffolk Coastal Council   
planning committee gave permission for 
a further 122 homes to be built on     
heathland adjoining the present        
Martlesham New Village by the Bradford 
Property Trust. Outline approval had   
been granted before the significance of
the site was realised. Conservationists
opposed to the development have warned 
of the potential destruction of half   
the colony of the butterflies.         
Efforts are to be made by the Suffolk  
Trust for Nature Conservation to save  
the remaining habitat.                 
The developers have agreed to fence off
the building area from adjacent        
heathland and to phase the construction
of houses to allow further study of the
butterflies this year and next year.   </content>
