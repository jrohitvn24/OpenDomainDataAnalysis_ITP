		<content>On the 19/6/85 we went to the offices  
of the two newspapers above to gather  
local news.**There is to be a cycle    
race in the town centre tonight        
organized by the Michelin Tyre Company 
and Anglia Television.It is the most   
hazardous of the four town centre races
to be run by them.**The town's Southern
District is to benefit from the plans  
of the superstore giants Tesco to build
  Â£7.5m shopping complex there.It will 
 reate more than 400 jobs.**Demolition 
men have levelled the South Midlands Co
op abattoir and warehouses to make way 
for their new superstore.This marks the
end of 3 years of struggle with the    
local residents-original plans to build
a transport depot met a wall of protest
because of the danger of an holocaust  
with so much fuel being stored.**There 
is a campaign to build a Mereway Sports
Complex of stadium and swimming pool.  </content>
