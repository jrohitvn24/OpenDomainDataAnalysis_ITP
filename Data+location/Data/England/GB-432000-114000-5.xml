		<content> Tatchbury Mount Hospital is a home    
 for mentally handicapped people.  It  
 was a private residence until 1933    
 when it was sold to Hampshire Area    
 Mental Welfare Authority.{ It is on an
{isolated 5 acre site which was        
{originally an Iron Age fort.          
{     }It houses 260 residents.The use 
 of Tatchbury is going to change in the
 near future.There is at present a     
 social revolution in the way that we  
 deal with mentally handicapped people.
 The move is to house patients in small
 community units. The hospital will    
 still care for the more seriously ill.
  There is a rumour that the Goverment 
 intends to sell about half of the site
 for residential building in the near  
 future.
