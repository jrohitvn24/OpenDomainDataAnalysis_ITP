		<content> From our questionnaire it appears that
 many more people have non-sporting    
 hobbies as opposed to sporting        
 hobbies. This is probably because     
 there are more old people living in   
 the area than young people.           
 There were 17 different sporting      
 hobbies mentioned, the most popular   
 being swimming followed by cricket and
 tennis.                               
 There were 75 non-sporting hobbies    
 listed of which gardening was the most
 popular, followed by walking. We were 
 surprised that very few people listed 
 watching television as a hobby.
