		<title>17B.M.X.RACING BY JOHNATHON</title>
		<content>  My favourite hobby is B.M.X.ing.     
 What is B.M.X.? Well it stands for    
 Bicycle Motor Cross.In order to do    
 BMXing you need a special bike with   
 re-inforced tubing to make it extra   
 strong to withstand all the bumps.    
 There are two types of BMX competition
         1.{FREESTYLE}                 
         2.{RACING}                    
 Freestyle is when you have to do      
 different tricks with your bike like  
 hops,framewhips,boomerang,endos and   
 wheelies.These are just a few.        
 Many children,like myself enjoy doing 
 these stunts anywhere we can.         
 Racing is when you have to go on a    
 special track with big bumps and very 
 sharp turns and other obstacles and   
 you compete against other riders.     
 B.M.X. is an ace sport !!!!!
