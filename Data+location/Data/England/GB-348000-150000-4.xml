		<title>04A MENDIP ARABLE FARM 1</title>
		<content> Priddy Hill Farm is in the north_east 
 corner of the survey block. The farm  
 covers an area of 450 acres,of which  
 400 acres are used for growing wheat, 
 barley,rape,peas and oats. The        
 remaining 50 acres are woodland,      
 scrubland and a few acres of grass    
 keep which are let. Arable farming is 
 favoured by gently{undulating ground} 
 and large fields; one field is in     
 excess of 50 acres. The straw         
 resulting from harvesting is auctioned
 off before harvesting actually occurs 
 and the farmer only burns the stubble 
 if weather conditions are favourable. 
 Some of the grain is transported to   
 Avonmouth and Southampton but the     
 farmer has recently built his own     
 storage facilities at the farm;peas   
 are sold for the production of cattle 
 food at Yeovel.
