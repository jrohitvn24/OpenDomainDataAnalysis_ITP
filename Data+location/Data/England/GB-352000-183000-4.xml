		<content> There is a variety of housing styles  
 in this area, some{detatched}and some 
{semi-detatched houses and bungalows}  
 built in the last thirty years. Heidi 
 Ward lives in a very old, stone       
 cottage called Marsh Cottage which is 
 by the railway bridge in Pilning. It  
 is a listed building and has          
 interesting features.                 
 There are some large old{farmhouses}  
 built of limestone scattered          
 throughout the area, most{cottages}   
 have been renovated and modernised for
 commuters.                            
 In Severn Beach there are some popular
 old people's{flats,}looked after by a 
 resident warden. 20% of the population
 live in{caravans}on permanent sites.  
 Few new houses have been built in     
 recent years. Three children in our   
 school live in{Public Houses}and four 
 live on farms.         Deborah Hunt.  </content>
