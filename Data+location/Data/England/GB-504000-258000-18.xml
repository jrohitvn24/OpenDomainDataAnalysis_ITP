		<content> St. Peters Church, Thurleigh, forms   
 the focal point of the village        
 buildings. The central tower was built
 in early 12th century. The southern   
 doorway has a tympanum depicting Eve  
 tempting Adam. In 1970, as a necessary
 repair, the aisle battlements and     
 clerestory were removed, a new nave   
 roof has been constructed, altering   
 the external proportions of the church
 from it's Mediaeval appearance.       
 The Bolnhurst village church of St.   
 Dunstan stands in an isolated         
 position. The village that was around 
 the church depopulated at the time of 
 the Black Death in 14th century and   
 was never reinhabited. The church is  
 100yds. back from the road surrounded 
 by trees, on the edge of the valley   
 overlooking the brook, By the south   
 entrance the stump of the church cross
 stands. Inside is simple and lovely.  </content>
