		<content> The village of Compton Dundon is      
 split up into two main sections: that 
 of Compton, and that of Dundon. The   
 village hall and the public house are 
 situated in Compton,and the school and
 church are in Dundon. In the{village  
{hall}many activities take place: for  
 example, during the day there are     
 upholstery classes and at night it is 
 occasionally used as a discotheque.The
 hall is run by a committee of which   
 the chairman, Major Strange, also owns
 the{shop/Post Office.}The shop is like
 any other village store and is the    
 centre of the community. Next door    
 there is a{filling station}and a      
 repair shop which is owned by a young 
 couple who employ at least one pump   
 attendant and a mechanic. Near by     
 there is a heavy goods vehicle garage.
 Castlebrook, the{public house}belongs 
 to Courage Brewery.                   </content>
