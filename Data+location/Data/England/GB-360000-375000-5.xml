 FARMING 4.CROPS - Potatoes.Farms grow,
 in addition to grass for silage,      
 potatoes and corn.Six of the eight    
 farms surveyed grow early and main    
 crop potatoes.Acreage varies from 44  
 down to just 5.Successful attempts are
 made to grow early potatoes to exploit
 the retail demand for "new potatoes". 
 Cereals:only 3 of the farms visited   
 grow any cereals and these grow wheat,
 barley and some oats, which are mainly
 used for winter cattle feed.Brook Farm
 (Ref.03600375C) grows 65 acres per    
 season, and being the largest producer
 of cereals in the area, has its own   
 combine harvester.The combine is hired
 out to other farmers under contract   
 during harvest time.
