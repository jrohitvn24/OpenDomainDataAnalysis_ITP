		<title>09RELIGION IN SUTTON ST JAMES</title>
		<content> Once there was a Methodist chapel in  
 the village, but that has been        
 demolished. However, there is the     
 church  of St James (Church of        
 England), and a Baptist Chapel, built 
 in 1797. At present there is no       
 Baptist minister so the Manse stands  
 empty. The vicar is also retiring very
 shortly and it may be some time       
 before a new one is found.            
 There is no Sunday school at the      
 church, so several children who go to 
 church have joined the Baptist Sunday 
 school, which has about fifteen       
 members.                              
 There is good co-operation between the
 churches and at some functions both   
 help each other to raise money for    
 their church.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
