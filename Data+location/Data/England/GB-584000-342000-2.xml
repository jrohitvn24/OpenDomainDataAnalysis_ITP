		<title>02OVERY HARBOUR</title>
		<content> In the harbour boats of all kinds     
 achor in the boat yard: fishing boats,
 ferries, speed boats and others.      
 Under the harbour are a few ship      
 wrecks.  In winter all the boats are  
 pulled into harbour in case strong    
 winds and ice smash the boats         
 together.  At high tide fishermen go  
 fishing far out in the sea to catch a 
 lot of fish.  Some dangers are at the 
 bank of the harbour.  People will fall
 in.  There are ship wrecks and when   
 the tide is in people can't walk      
 across the harbour because the current
 will pull them under and they will    
 drown.  At low tide people can walk   
 across the creek because the water is 
 only ankle deep.  The creek is very   
 dangerous and Mr. Peter Back the Coast
 Guard is always on the look out.
