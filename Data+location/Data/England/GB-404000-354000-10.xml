		<title>10Tourism- Butterton &amp; Onecote</title>
		<content>     Tourists come to Butterton from   
various parts ot the country.  They    
make the local business boom in lots of
ways.  They buy food and drink from    
the   local pub - The Black Lion.      
When tourists come they stay either at 
The Black Lion or camp on farmland.    
The comments made about the village    
are very favourable.                   
     There are a few Guesthouses and   
some self-catering accommodation in    
Onecote.  Each place can cater for     
between 4 and 6 people.                
     Most of the tourists who stay in  
Oncote come from the south of the      
country.  Very few people come to stay 
from the north of England or Scotland. 
     Most of the tourist accommodation 
opens from March to October but the    
self-catering places allow long-staying
guests during the winter months.  The  
busiest months are July to September.  </content>
