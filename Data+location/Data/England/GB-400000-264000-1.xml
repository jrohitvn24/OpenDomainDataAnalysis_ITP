		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> This area is a rural area consisting  
 of rough pastureland left fallow or   
 used for the grazing of sheep. There  
 are some feed crops grown for the farm
 animals. The farmers are usually      
 owners and not tenants who farm on a  
 small scale. The rest of the area is  
 residential. It started with small    
 isolated villages which have spread   
 until each has mingled with the       
 other.House building on quite a large 
 scale has taken place over the last 8 
 years, vastly increasing the          
 population.The houses are mainly owner
 ocupied but council owned properties  
 are interspersed successfully on a    
 small scale. Education is provided by 
 6 schools,1 High school 14-18, 1      
 Middle school 10-14 years and 4 First 
 schools 4+-9.
