{textile and footwear}industries. The{ 
{textile}industry does not employ as   
 many people as previously as many     
 mills have closed down. About{12%}of  
 the working population are now        
 unemployed.{Carrs Industrial Estate}is
 an Enterprise Zone, opened in 1983.   
 Grants have been given by the{E.E.C.} 
 to encourage people to open factories 
 there. The local by-pass which joins  
 the M66 has resulted in better        
 communications to the area. Goods can 
 be brought in and taken out quickly.

 in manufacturing industries and{47%}in
 service areas.{6%}are house-wives. The
