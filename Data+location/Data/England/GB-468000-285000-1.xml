		<title>01EVERY DAY THINGS IN LUBENHAM</title>
		<content>     Each day the children under 11 go 
 to Lubenham school, at 9.10 AM they   
 go into school and they finish at 3.30
 PM .Each summer the school has a      
 school sports day.                    
     Each month there is bingo in the  
 village hall.                         
     Then in summer a lot of children  
 go down to the river Welland they take
 tyre inner tubes which they use as a  
 boat.At the village park there is a   
 slide, some swings,a roundabout and a 
 chinese swing.                        
     We have a village fete on the     
 green and some of the cub scouts help 
 on some of the stalls.All this happens
 in the summer holidays.               
     Then it is back to school where   
 they have recently started a running  
 and a science club, for the 1st 2nd   
 3rd and the 4th years.                
     There are jumble sales all through</content>
