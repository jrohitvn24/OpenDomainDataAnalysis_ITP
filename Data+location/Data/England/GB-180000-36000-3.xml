		<content>   Mr and Mrs Prout live in Mylor.     
 They have lived in the village        
 for many years and have noticed quite 
 a few changes.Mrs Prout was a district
 nurse during the war and Mr Prout     
 owned the hardware store next         
 door.Mylor was bombed during the war, 
 a whole row of 5 cottages was         
 destroyed in one raid alone.These     
 cottages were situated in the Lemon   
 Arms carpark.                         
   There were three water pumps in the 
 village,the main one being in the     
 centre.When the water mains were      
 brought into the village none of the  
 villagers were allowed to drink from  
 the pumps and they were closed down.He
 also said that gas had never been     
 brought into the village.Proper sewage
 amenities were put in after the war.  
 Mrs Prout prefers living in an old    
 cottage rather than a modern house.   </content>
