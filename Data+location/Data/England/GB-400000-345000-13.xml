  In 1950 the Caldon Canal was still   
used for pleasure boating, until a     
lock gate broke and the boat trips     
came to an abrupt halt. The Cauldon    
Canal society was formed in the 1960s. 
Soon plans were made to rebuild the    
locks and clear the canal. Then in     
1974 the Caldon Canal was marvelously  
restored.                              
  In 1978 Bill and Jackie Young came   
to Froghall Wharf, which had been      
made into a picnic area, to start a    
business with a horse-drawn trip       
boat called Birdswood. In 1981 the     
Youngs converted the old warehouse into
a coffee shop. Bill and Jackie run     
boat trips along the Caldon Canal      
for over 10,000 tourists every year.   
Within 200 years Froghall Wharf has    
changed from a hive of industry to a   
popular tourist attraction.            </content>
