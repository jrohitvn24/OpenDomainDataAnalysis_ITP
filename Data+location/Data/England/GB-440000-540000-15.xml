 The{Peterlee Carnival}comes to Helford
 Road every September. When we go to   
 the Carnival we have lots of fun. In  
 the Peterlee Carnival the{Peterlee    
{Half Marathon}takes place. The        
 Carnival itself takes place on the    
 cricket pitch.                        
 The three wheeler motorbikes are 50p a
 ride. The slot machines are 2p or 1p a
 go. Sometimes you can win lots of     
 money. At the Carnival there are also 
 computers at 5p a go. "The Eggs" is a 
 big wheel which goes very fast. The   
 Army also has a display at the        
 carnival. In the big tents you can buy
 almost anything.                      
 The game with floating plastic ducks  
 is called "Hook The Duck". It is a    
 game where you catch a duck with a    
 hook. At the end you can win a prize  
 if you are lucky!                     </content>
