		<content>   After the pit filling process has   
 been completed, then effort is made to
 landscape the area.   Later, various  
 forms of plant life - trees, grasses  
 and cereal crops are encouraged       
 successfully to grow.  Cattle have    
 used the area for grazing and some    
 cereals have been cropped.  The whole 
 area is a haven for wild life and     
 every effort has been made to enable  
 swans, geese, ducks and small mammals 
 to inhabit the area.                  
   Certain pits have test buildings    
 plced upon them to give guidelines as 
 to the future possibilities of house  
 building on the reclaimed pits.       
 Already the southern section of the   
 Peterborough ring road has been       
 constructed for some 2 km across      
 reclaimed pits.
