		<title>14ROWLANDS CASTLE ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content>    The object of the Association is to
 conserve the character of Rowlands    
 Castle, to provide a channel of       
 communication on matters of local     
 interest, and to enhance the life of  
 the village by fostering participation
 in village activities.                
    They concern themselves with such  
 items as the 40% increase in the      
 housing in the parish proposed in     
 the Horndean Area Local Plan, and     
 their representations (through        
 the Parish Council) were instrumental 
 in persuading the Department of the   
 Environment Inspector to reduce the   
 building proposed on the triangle site
 to 10%. The Nature Conservancy is also
 interested in this site.              
    A proposal had been put forward for
 a BMX cycle track for children at the 
 Recreation ground.
