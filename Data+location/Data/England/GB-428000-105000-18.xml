		<title>18The People of Lyndhurst</title>
		<content> During our survey many inhabitants    
 were interviewed giving us an insight 
 into the history of the area, and the 
 news and views of the people there    
 today.                                
 Most people like living in the area   
 because it is peaceful and close to   
 the New Forest.                       
 One lady who lives in the cottage by  
 Parkhill Hotel keeps cows, horses and 
 chickens and grows her own vegetables.
   She has a car but rides her horse   
 nearly everwhere; and like many other 
 inhabitants, would like to see the    
 area remain much the same as it is    
 today.                                
 In the 15th century travellers used to
 stop at the Crown and Stirrup Public  
 House for refreshments on their       
 journeys. Tourists travel through     
 Lyndhurst today and the summer traffic
 is of much concern there.             </content>
