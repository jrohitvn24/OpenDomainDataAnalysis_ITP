		<title>16Upper Bush-Barrowhill House</title>
		<content> Upper Bush is a peacful cul-de-sac    
 surrounded by fields and woodland.    
 Once it was a hamlet of over 20 houses
 but now only 6 remain, 4 of these     
 being over 300 years old.  The oldest,
 Barrowhill House, a yeoman farmer's   
 house built in 1390, is owned by Mr &amp; 
 Mrs Knott.  When they bought the      
 property, 21 years ago, it had been   
 turned into 3 farm workers' cottages  
 which had become derelict and had been
 condemned by Rochester Council.       
 Realising the age of the property Mr  
 Knott, a member of the legal          
 profession, bought &amp; restored it, and 
 today this lovely, oak beamed house   
 has every modern comfort as well as   
 old world charm.  Mr Knott enjoys     
 living in this quiet spot and would   
 not like to see it change in any way. 
 They &amp; others of the hamlet have      
 successfully fought building plans.   </content>
