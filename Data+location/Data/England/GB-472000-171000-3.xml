		<title>03LEAVING ALFRED SUTTON BOYS</title>
		<content>   A lot of people like Alfred Sutton  
 Boys School and don't want to leave. I
 am mainly one of those boys.  I am    
 going to Prospect school(a combination
 of Westwood Girls and Stoneham Boys   
 schools). I do not like the idea of   
 the school closing. I have to buy a   
 new uniform which will cost a lot of  
 money and I have to make new friends. 
   Prospect school is mixed. I like the
 idea of mixed schools because we can  
 share the classroom with girls.       
 Prospect will be a lot different      
 because it will have a lot more pupils
 and I wont have so many friends.  I   
 will have to catch two buses to go to 
 my new school.  It will cost a lot of 
 money but it is the nearest to my     
 house.
