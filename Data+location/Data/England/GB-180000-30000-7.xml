		<content> We carried out a survey to find       
 out                                   
 what some children do in their spare  
 time.We found that their answers      
 varied according to the season,weather
 etc.In the summer months many         
 children enjoyed playing outdoors     
 doing such things as riding           
 bycicles,going swimming,playing on the
 beach,jogging,keeping fit and         
 fishing.In the winter months,many     
 children spent time watching          
 television.Some said this was because 
 they enjoyed it others said they like 
 the veriaty of programmes.Reading     
 books was another favourite for       
 relaxation.
