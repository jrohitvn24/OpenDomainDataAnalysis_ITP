		<title>04ROAD SCHEME.</title>
		<content>  In the 1930's the outer ring road was
 proposed to skirt the city of         
 Leicester.The urban area has grown and
 the Southern District Distributor road
 now under construction aims to improve
 access to industrial development and  
 major motorways in Leicestershire. The
 first sign of the road development was
 the felling of some twenty mature lime
 trees on the A50 which were about     
 forty years old.Local people were very
 apprehensive about the development    
 scheme.Individual protests grew into  
 group action. They used local radio   
 and papers,lobbied councillors and    
 expressed local opinion.In the end    
 they managed to change the plan from a
 dual carriageway to a single one.     
 Landscaping will compensate for the   
 disturbance to the environment.
