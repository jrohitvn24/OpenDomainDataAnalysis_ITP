 There are no really large shops in    
 Saffron Walden. Apart from shops like 
 newsagents and tobacconists nearly all
 the shops are in the town centre to   
 thesouth of the market place. The     
 largest shops are International,      
 Budgens, Co-op and Woolworths. None of
 these are as large as their           
 counterparts in other towns such as   
 Cambridge. There are a large number of
 small shops selling specialised foods,
 clothes, antiques or luxury goods.    
 This is still in spite of the         
 recession a fairly wealthy area. The  
 prices are above what we would pay for
 the same goods in Harlow which is     
 where there are large department      
 stores.
