		<content> At home I went into the kitchen and   
 got a packet of crisps.I went up      
 stairs and opened the window and      
 looked out.I saw my brother playing   
 football with my dog.I watched for a  
 little while and then played with my  
 Barbie(a doll). I played with it until
 tea time.For tea I had a salad with   
 chicken, tomato,cucumber and other    
 things.I was watching Rolf Harris     
 cartoon time while eating my tea.After
 tea I went outside to play tennis.I   
 played that for a while.Then my       
 brother and dad came out and we played
 catch with three balls.We all had to  
 throw at the same time.We played other
 games as well.I did handstands and    
 cartwheels.Then I went to bed &amp; read.
