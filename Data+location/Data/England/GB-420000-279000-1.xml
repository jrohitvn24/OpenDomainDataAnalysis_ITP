		<title>01Our Domesday Block</title>
		<content>      Our block is situated in the     
 Metropolitan Borough of{Solihull}     
 within the County of the West         
 Midlands. It is not densely populated,
 most of the people living in the      
 village of{Hampton-In-Arden}in the    
 North West of the block. Apart from   
 this village, most of the rest of the 
 land is used for farming which is of a
 mixed nature, fairly evenly divided   
 between arable crops and intensively  
 managed grassland. In the North East  
 there is a large area of quarrying for
 sand and gravel. The land is gently   
 undulating, with high land to East and
 West with the valley of the{River}    
{Blythe}between. Roughly parallel to   
 the river is the busy Kenilworth Road 
 which divides the block in two. The   
 main London to Birmingham{railway}line
 further divides the block from South  
 East to North West.                   </content>
