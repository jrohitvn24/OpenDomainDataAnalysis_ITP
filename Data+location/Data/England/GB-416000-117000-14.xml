		<title>14THE PEST CONTROL OFFICER</title>
		<content>  A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE PEST CONTROL  
 OFFICER (WHO IS EMPLOYED BY THE NEW   
 FOREST DISTRICT COUNCIL) CAME TO      
 SCHOOL TO TELL US ABOUT HIS JOB.      
  RATS AND MICE ARE HIS MAIN CONCERN   
 BUT HE ALSO CONTROLS WASPS,ANTS,      
 BEETLES,FLIES,COCKROACHES AND MOLES.  
  HIS FIRST JOB EVERY DAY IS TO MIX THE
 VARIOUS POISONS. WHILE HE IS DOING HIS
 JOB HE ALWAYS WEARS OVERALLS, MASK AND
 GLOVES, AND FOR WASPS AND HORNETS HE  
 WEARS A SPECIAL HAT WITH WHITE NET ON 
 ONE SIDE, FOR LOOKING THROUGH WHEN HE 
 IS OUTSIDE, AND BLACK NET ON THE OTHER
 SIDE FOR LOOKING THROUGH INSIDE.      
  THE RAT PELLETS WORK BY STOPPING THE 
 RATS' BLOOD FROM CLOTTING SO THAT THEY
 BLEED INTERNALLY TO DEATH.            
  SMOKE CAPSULES ARE USED TO KILL      
 INSECTS IN BUILDINGS BUT OUTSIDE      
 POWDER IS SPRAYED ON THE NESTS WITH   
 BELLOWS.                              </content>
