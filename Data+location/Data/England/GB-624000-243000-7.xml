		<content>Sand and gravel has been excavated from
a site at Sheep Drift Farm for the last
25 years. The site covers over 90 acres
and lies a half mile to the North of   
Ipswich to Waldringfield Road and just 
east of the Martlesham Industrial      
Estate. At present the main workings   
extend over 45 acres and a further 48  
acres of the site have yet to be       
quarried.                              
Modern plant wash, grade and load the  
material on site and a fleet of 21     
lorries belonging to the firm of       
Wilding &amp; Smith distribute the product 
to builders and other customers in the 
area. Fifty one people are employed in 
the business.                          
A large lake extends over former       
workings up to 33 feet deep and this is
well stocked with fish.Part of the site
has been reclaimed and will revert to  
farmland later in l985.                </content>
