		<content>  Ickwell is a small village about 3   
 miles west of Biggleswade,often       
 described as looking like the ideal   
 village.It has a wide green with a    
 cricket pitch in the middle and an old
 oak tree with a wooden seat under     
 it.There is a maypole on the green    
 where annual May Day celebrations,    
 dating from the 16th century take     
 place.                                
  Cottages and other residences circle 
 the green.Some of them have thatched  
 roofs and nearly all have neat gates  
 and well kept gardens.A speciality of 
 these buildings is "Ickwell peach",the
 colour that they are painted.It is a  
 mixture of orange and yellow but not  
 all cottages are the exact shade.Many 
 of the cottages have in the past had  
 to do without plumbing and lavatories.
