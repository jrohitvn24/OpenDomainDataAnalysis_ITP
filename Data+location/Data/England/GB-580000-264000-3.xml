		<content>RISBY. One corner of the surveyed area 
includes a part of the village of RISBY
which is a traditional Suffolk village 
in close proximity to a growing town.  
The village has grown in recent years  
with the addition of modern private    
housing in some cases forming small    
estates. The nucleus of the traditional
village remains intact centring on the 
village green. The church, on the other
hand, is towards the eastern edge of   
the village indicating a shift of      
population at some time in the         
development of the village. Some       
village residents living in older      
properties make considerable efforts to
maintain the traditional character of  
their properties. These properties are 
houses of the timber-frame (or         
half-timbered) type dating back to the 
15th and 16th centuries.
