		<title>08Birdham, The Old School</title>
		<content> The old school building is situated on
 the corner of Birdham Straight, A286, 
 and Crooked Lane. It was built in     
 1817. The original list of subscribers
 is still displayed in the present     
 school. The school was originally     
 called "The Manhood National School"  
 and served W.Itchenor,E. &amp; W.         
 Wittering, Earnley, Sidlesham, and    
 Birdham. The school was added to in   
 1874 and again in 1875 when the       
 Infants were given their own building.
  The school was for 5 to 14 year olds 
 and had about 120 pupils. The School  
 moved to its present site in 1964.    
 Until 1984 the old building was used  
 as a small assembly business and is   
 currently being converted into        
 residential units. The playground has 
 5 new houses in a close named Old     
 School Close.
