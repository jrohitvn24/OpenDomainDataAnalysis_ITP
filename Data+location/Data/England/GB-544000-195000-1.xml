		<content> The area which this block covers is in
 the main farmland.   It is of mixed   
 usage, with cattle, grassland and hay,
 small farms are not so common today,  
 they have been swollowed up into      
 larger esates.   A small area within  
 the block is residential, with housing
 and industry combined.   The Bank Of  
 England have premises where coins are 
 minted, copy printing paper is also   
 manufactured, there is also light     
 engineering.   The mill motorway also 
 runs through this area a feature of   
 this is an interchance where traffic  
 can only exit and enter to and from   
 London.   The village of Abridge has  
 not changed much over the years, no   
 major development has taken place, and
 new building has been kept in line    
 with existing old buildings.
