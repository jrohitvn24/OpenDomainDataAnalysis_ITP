		<title>19CHOIR AND CHURCH (CONT)</title>
		<content> the organ starts playing and we walk  
 to the aisle and bowto the altar.     
  While we are having a church service 
 others are learning about God at      
{Sunday School,}many children from our 
 school belong to it.                  
   In{Sunday School}you can make lots  
 of things. We read out of the bible to
 improve our kmowledge of the bible.   
  If it is matins at church we stay the
 whole hour at{Sunday School}but if it 
 is communion we stay about thirty five
 minutes because we go up to be        
 blessed.
