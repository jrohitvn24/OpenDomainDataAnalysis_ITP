		<title>13FARMING</title>
		<content> Over 80% of the Survey Area is farm   
 land in the Green Belt.The North      
 East is Grade 2 land but much of the  
 area has poor soils.There are patches 
 of damaged farmland used for refuse   
 disposal,of threatened landscape with 
 caravan parks,stables and piggeries,  
 and of other farmland near Pilgrims   
 Hatch which has been abandoned perhaps
 for planning gain.The main crop is    
 barley with a great increase in the   
 area under rape.Market gardening and  
 garden centres are expanding.Sheep,   
 beef cattle and dairy cattle are kept.
 Canterbury Tye farm has been split by 
 the Brentwood by_pass.South East of   
 the by_pass,the farmland is owned by  
 Courage Brewery while the other part  
 is owned by a Mountnessing farmer.The 
 farm house and barns dated 1650 are   
 occupied by a shopowner who does not  
 farm the few fields he owns.          </content>
