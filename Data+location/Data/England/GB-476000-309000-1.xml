Somerby  situated on a ironstone ridge 
600ft above sealevel in the east of    
Leicestershire. Built in linear form   
with no actual centre it is rather an  
ugly village from the road but it has  
beautiful countryside all round.       
The school built for 120 pupils now    
has only 37.Housing is mostly converted
farm workers cottages.There is a small 
council estate of 20 houses.Shopping in
the village is very expensive and      
limited so most families make a weekly 
trip to Melton Mowbray or Oakham both  
journeys of six miles.The recreational 
facilities for children are reasonable 
but for young adults there is nothing  
which causes drift to the towns.
