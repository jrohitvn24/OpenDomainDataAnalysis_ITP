		<title>16The Family</title>
		<content> 30% of our children came from a       
"two-child" family. 30% also came from 
a "three-child" family. 10% were       
"only" children. 10% had four children 
and 10% had five children in their     
families.                              
 Most families had three bedroom houses
whatever size the family but about 30% 
had four-bedroom houses.               
 Between 25% and 30% of families were  
divorced and mostly remarried which    
might account for the large families.  
 Almost all the fathers worked within  
20 miles of Witney with a couple       
commuting to London and quite a number 
travelling to Oxford but most fathers  
worked within a few miles of home.     
About 60% of mothers worked, either    
part time or full time. They mostly    
worked very close to home.             
 Only a couple of families had a       
grandparent living with them.          </content>
