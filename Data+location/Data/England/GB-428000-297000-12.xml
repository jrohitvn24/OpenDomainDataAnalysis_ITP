		<title>12VISIT TO LOCAL FIRE STATION</title>
		<content>On Wed.11thJune a group of children    
went to the fire station.When we       
arrived we went upstairs to an office, 
where the station officer,Mr Valentine 
told us some general things about the  
station and its firemen.We were shown  
the electronic printer and we were all 
amazed at the speed of the machine on  
the touch of a button.There were two   
fire engines.First we were shown the   
drivers seat.All engines have to have a
radio system.The maximum people the    
engines could hold was 6 and the       
minimum 4.Also we were shown the hose  
pipes,there were two sorts.One was long
and very tough and the other was       
smaller and not so hard.The tough one  
was used for high water pressure in big
fires.At the back of the engines was a 
tank to store the water for the        
hosepipes.   HELEN COOKE AGED 10
