 I am 11 years old and I live in a four
 hundred year old cottage in           
 Porthoustock.  I was one when I moved 
 here from Redruth.  My family chose   
 Porthoustock because it was peaceful, 
 quiet countryside by the sea.  I love 
 walking in the valley and along the   
 cliffs. I make dens all over the      
 place. I go swimming from the beach in
 the Summer.  The east wind is a       
 disadvantage and the visitors who     
 leave litter which I don't like.      
 Being away from the village means I   
 have to have a bike or walk.  My      
 parents don't like the isolation.  Dad
 leaves early to go to work as a       
 carpenter.  Mummy works for the 'nurse
 bank'.  I go fishing with my friend   
 who has a holiday cottage.  I like    
 living here because there is always   
 something to do.                      </content>
