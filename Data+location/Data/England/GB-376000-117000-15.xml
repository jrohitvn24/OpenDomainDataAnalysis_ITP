		<content>  MARNHULL CHRISTIAN CARE is a         
 community effort to offer help and    
 assistance to anyone in need in the   
 parish.A committee comprises members  
 of the 3 village churches.In each road
 a contact person acts as a link,      
 visiting newcomers and being available
 either to help in person in case of   
 emergency,or by relaying news to      
 others who can help.                  
  A comprehensive list of essential    
 services is given to all residents and
 help is available in many practical   
 ways,particularly for elderly and     
 disabled people.                      
  The MARNHULL MESSENGER comes out six 
 times a year and is disributed free to
 880 homes.The churches,clubs and      
 societies send contributions to the   
 editor who designed the cover and does
 any drawings inside.It costs Â£490 to  
 print,covered mainly by advertising.  </content>
