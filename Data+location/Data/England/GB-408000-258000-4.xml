		<content>      Most of the area's 10 farms have 
 dairy herds. This is how it is done on
 one of them. A young cow only starts  
 to give milk after her first calf is  
 born, then the calf is taken from its 
 mother and fed by the farmer. Cows are
 milked twice a day. They walk one by  
 one into the milking parlour, and     
 stand facing outwards in a herring    
 bone pattern. During milking, food is 
 automatically put into their troughs, 
 the udders and teats are washed, then 
 the metal cups of the machine are put 
 on. The milk is sucked by vacuum into 
 glass jars, through pipes, to a large 
 cooled tank. Each cow gives about 4   
 gallons a day and a tanker takes the  
 milk to the dairy. It is tested every 
 day to make sure it is safe for people
 to drink. Milk from a cow given       
 medicine cannot be used.
