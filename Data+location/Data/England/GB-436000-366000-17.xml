 There are no state nurseries in our   
 area, but many children go to private 
{play schools}or{play groups}before    
 they are 4.                           
   There is a board of{governers}in    
 charge of each school.  They consist  
 of 1 parent, 1 teacher, 6 Education   
 Committe and 4 Parish Council members.
 It is their job, with the headmaster, 
 to plan the organisation and the      
 curriculum of the school.             
   In the schools in our area the      
 average class size for infants is 28, 
 and juniors 33.                       
   Each school has 12 weeks holiday a  
 year.
