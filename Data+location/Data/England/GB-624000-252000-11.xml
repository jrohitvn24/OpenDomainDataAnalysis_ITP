		<title>11Dairy Farming in Bredfield</title>
		<content>     Cows have to be milked before the 
tanker comes in the morning, which can 
be as early as five o'clock. The second
milking must not be more than fourteen 
hours later. A cow can be milked for   
three hundred days after she has had a 
calf, and then rests for sixty five    
days. At first she gives twenty two    
litres of milk a day, but it gradually 
gets less. A cow needs one hundred and 
ten litres of water a day at its best  
milking time. A cowman can look after a
hundred cows, but it is hard physical  
work keeping everywhere clean as there 
is no machinery to do it. In summer    
outside cows eat grass and weeds, but  
in winter inside they eat hay, silage  
or cattlecake.                         
     The dairy farmers keep their      
hedges as windbreaks, and those in     
Bredfield also want to keep them and   
their meadows to conserve wildlife.    </content>
