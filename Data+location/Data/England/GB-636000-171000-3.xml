		<title>03    The Promenade</title>
		<content>     The cliff-top walks from Botany   
 Bay to Foreness Bay (The Gallops)     
 provide the area with wild flowers and
 birds, and a small golf course near   
 which is the coast guard.             
     The area of green and promenade   
 towards Palm Bay is recreational, with
 the start of the Spring Thanet        
 Marathon and Summer Margate Carnival. 
 Tennis courts are available, and the  
 Ship's Cannons are pleasure spots for 
 walkers. The St.Georges Bowling Green 
 and Cafe are found opposite Butlins,  
 St.Georges Hotel. The Meteorological  
 station is found here too.            
     There is a bandstand, The Oval,   
 open in summer, near which a Thursday 
 market is held. The Crazy Golf course 
 is found opposite the Ten Pin Bowling 
 Alley. At the Lido, tourists listen to
 the organist, play Bingo or gamble in 
 the Arcades.                          </content>
