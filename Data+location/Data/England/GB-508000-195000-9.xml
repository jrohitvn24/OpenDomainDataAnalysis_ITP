		<content> A typical day would go like this:     
                                       
 A child would get up at about 7.00 to 
 get ready for school. School starts   
 at 9.00 and finishes usually about    
 3.30 or 4.00. At school you either    
 take a packed lunch, a school         
 dinner or go home for dinner. At home 
 you have a snack and a drink and then 
 you do homework. After dinner you     
 usually go out and play with friends. 
                                       
 Meanwhile parents would be sitting    
 reading the newspaper or watching     
 television. Most parents go to work in
 the day for more money. Men used to   
 work in the{printing}or{brewery}      
 business.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
