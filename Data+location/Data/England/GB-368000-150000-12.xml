		<title>12TRANSPORT - KILMERSDON AREA</title>
		<content> Public transport is very inadequate,  
 as the schedule indicates. Thursday - 
 round trip to Radstock and Midsomer   
 Norton, allowing one and a half hours 
 shopping time. Saturday - ditto for   
 Bath, allowing 2 hours. Last Friday in
 month - round trip to Frome (minibus).
 Charlton and Newbury have nothing.    
 The busy B3l39 road is a major feature
 running through Charlton &amp; Kilmersdon 
 and the car is a necessity for most   
 families. The older indigenous        
 population is hardest hit, but many   
 families are inter-related and a      
 relation can often supply the need.   
 There is a Kilmersdon taximan, and the
 N H S provides a runabout ambulance to
 take outpatients to hospital          
 appointments. The "good neighbour     
 spirit" takes a friend to the nearest 
 bus station or do shopping. Some      
 younger ones have motor bikes.        </content>
