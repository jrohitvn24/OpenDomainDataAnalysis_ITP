		<title>14GOAT-KEEPING DRINKSTONE</title>
		<content> We keep goats. We have two British    
 Alpines named Rosie and Kitty. They   
 are black and white. Every year they  
 have kids. The father is Anglo-Nubian.
 He is brown with a black stripe. This 
 year we had four kids. Two had colours
 like the father, and two like the     
 mothers. There is an electric fence   
 around the goats' grazing area. It    
 works by a big battery which costs    
 Â£12. The goats eat grass, oats, maize,
 dried peas, sugar-beet and hay. My Mum
 milks them in the morning and I help  
 her. We strain the milk, then cool it.
 We have some for breakfast, and sell  
 some. We have goats because my brother
 is allergic to cows' milk. It gives   
 him eczema.  The kids are used for    
 meat. We put them in the freezer.
