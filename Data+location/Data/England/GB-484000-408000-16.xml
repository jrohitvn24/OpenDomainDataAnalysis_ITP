		<content> There is a large superstore complex on
 the edge of our block. We had a look  
 around. Apart from the supermarket    
 there are some smaller shops:- a      
 pharmacy, furniture shop and a shoe   
 shop. There is a tyre fitting bay and 
 petrol station too.                   
 Behind the superstore is a residential
 caravan site with 106 caravans, 36    
 chalets and 25 huts. On the other side
 of the road is a modern pub called The
 Mallard. Beyond that is Scunthorpe    
 Golf Course. Over the road from that  
 is a new, private housing development 
 where there are some very expensive   
 houses and bungalows, most with double
 garages and beautiful, well-kept      
 gardens. Some of the trees were not   
 cut down so the houses are well       
 shaded. Nearby there is Silica Lodge  
 Lake which is quite deep. It is split 
 almost into two by an island.         </content>
