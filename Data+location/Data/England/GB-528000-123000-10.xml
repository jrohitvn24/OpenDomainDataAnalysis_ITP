		<title>10CHILDRENS VIEWS OF CUCKFIELD</title>
		<content>  Children of Cuckfield County Primary 
 School aged 7-10 like living in       
 Cuckfield because it has the friendly 
 atmosphere of a small country village.
  Clubs and social groups are an       
 integral part of their everyday life. 
 Brownies, cubs, dancing, church       
 choir, cricket and football clubs are 
 most popular.                         
  10-11 year olds think that a cinema, 
 swimming pool and a BMX track would   
 improve Cuckfield. 7-8 year olds      
 prefer Cuckfield as it is.            
  The majority of families in Cuckfield
 shop in the larger surrounding towns  
 e.g. Burgess Hill. Children use the   
 Cuckfield shops to buy sweets, toys,  
 etc. Most children prefer Cuckfield in
 the summer as they can then enjoy     
 their favourite aspects of Cuckfield: 
 The park and sporting clubs. Most feel
 Cuckfield has something to offer all. </content>
