		<content> Discipline was strict in some         
 families. Nobody was allowed to get   
 down from the table before the others 
 had finished eating. Talking by       
 children at the table was not allowed 
 unless they were asked to. Many       
 families said  grace at mealtimes.    
    At school talking was forbidden &amp;  
 everyday  there was an assembly.      
    Outside discipline was also        
 strict. Girls were not allowed to walk
 along the seafront in their bathing   
 costumes. If they did a policeman     
 would ask them to put on their        
 coats. No-one went into a shop        
 bare-footed.                          
    There was no grafitti to be seen   
 anywhere.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
