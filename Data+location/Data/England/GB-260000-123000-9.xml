		<content> THE LOCAL CHURCH-Umberleigh Christian 
 Fellowship was first built in 1920.   
 The walls of the church are made of   
 stone and the roof is black tiles     
 which are made from bricks. There are 
 about 200 hymn books. The seats are   
 comfortable. The church has a family  
 service every month. The caretaker    
 lives next to the church at           
 Hazelcroft. The service times on      
 Sunday are 11am and 6.30pm Mid week   
 there are prayer or group meetings and
 Sunday School is held during Sunday   
 morning service. There are clubs for  
 young boys,girls and teenagers. There 
 is also a Church of England church    
 which is looked after by the vicar    
 from South Molton now that the vicar  
 from Chittlehampton has recently died.
 It is a small quaint building built of
 wood.
