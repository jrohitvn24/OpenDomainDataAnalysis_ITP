		<title>11The River Severn</title>
		<content> Our area is dominated by the river.It 
 exerts its powerful and pervasive     
 presence even though it is not always 
 easily seen as it flows between muddy 
 banks which are flanked by            
 levees:man-made almost continuous     
 mounds set a few metres back from the 
 edges of the river,parallel to them,  
 intended to prevent flooding of the   
 low-lying land and,incidentally,      
 giving the walker a good raised path  
 from which to observe its life.The    
 river is tidal here and its brown-grey
 water swirls restlessly up and down   
 stream with occasional debris such as 
 a tree-trunk or fuel-drum.In its      
 waters swim eels and salmon,both      
 important to the people of the        
 area.Its propensity for flooding      
 dictates the use of the land round    
 it:low-intensity farming,houses and   
 barns carefully sited,summer crops.   </content>
