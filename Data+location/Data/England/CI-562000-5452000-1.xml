		<content>      This block lying in the centre of
 Jersey contains the Centre Stone. For 
 the most part the land, level and     
 relatively high, is interspersed by   
 valleys containing some of the main   
 reservoirs one of them being Handois. 
 Naturally the main industry is        
 agricultural, with strong             
 horticultural overtones. The tourist  
 industry does not seem to be well     
 represented in this area, as its      
 central position is fairly remote     
 from the beaches. Only one large store
 located in the N.E of the block is to 
 be found, that of D.I.Y. and Garden   
 Centre.                               
      In the rural areas most of the   
 farm buildings are of considerable age
 and well maintained, which could be   
 evidence of the prosperity of the     
 farming industry.
