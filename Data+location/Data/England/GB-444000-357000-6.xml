		<content> When I get up in the morning I go to  
 the bathroom and do the normal things 
 you do in a bathroom like brushing    
 your teeth, washing your hands and    
 face and brushing my hair. Then I walk
 back to my bedroom. By this time my   
 mum and dad are getting up. I get     
 dressed and go down stairs to have my 
 breakfast. I get my bag ready for     
 school and go. When I get to school we
 go into the yard. At 9 o'clock we go  
 into school and get on with our work. 
 At 10.40 we go out to play, coming in 
 at 10.55 and get on with even more    
 work! That is except for Tuesdays when
 we have P.E. Lunch is at 12 noon. We  
 start back work at 13.15. At 15.30 we 
 go home!! I have my tea then I watch  
 T.V. I have a shower, watch more T.V. 
 then go to bed and do some reading    
 before going to sleep.
