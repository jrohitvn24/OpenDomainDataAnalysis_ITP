 the north east such as Chester-le-    
 street Durham and Redcar.We usually   
 leave early in a coach.There are about
 25{Legionaires.}The youngest are 6 and
 the oldest is 18. We all march and    
 some play instruments such as {kazoo  
{ glockenspiel}and {drums.}We are      
 judged for our playing and marching   
 and win trophies and medals.I've won  
 99 medals.On the first Sunday in      
 August we have a carnival in Kirkby   
 Stephen when we march through the town
 from the Croglin Hotel to the Grammar 
 School.But this year we are going to  
 march back along Faraday Rd.and up    
 Westgarth Rd.ending at the Rugby Club.</content>
