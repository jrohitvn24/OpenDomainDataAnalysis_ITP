 When Pollard awoke, he was dismayed to
 find the boar's head missing, until he
 remembered the tongue in his pocket   
 and he went straight to the Bishop's  
 Palace.                               
 He was not too soon, for the Bishop   
 was just thanking the stranger for his
 bravery. Pollard cried out,"It was I  
 who killed the boar!", but the Bishop 
 showed him the boar's head the        
 stranger had brought and asked for    
 Pollard's proof. Pollard showed him   
 the tongue and the Bishop saw that he 
 had truly killed the beast and offered
 him as reward as much land as Pollard 
 could ride round while the Bishop     
 dined.                                
 After the Bishop had dined, Pollard   
 said,"I have ridden no farther than   
 round your own castle!"
