		<content>   The youth club is run by two adults,
Chris and Gaz.We have our meetings on  
Mondays and Thursdays from 6 30pm to   
10 30pm in a wooden building by Hill   
Top school.To join you have to be ten  
years old and you have to leave when   
you are about twenty.The club closes   
during the school holidays.As I am     
only eleven I usually leave at about   
nine o'clock and walk home with my     
friends.At the youth club there is     
music,either tapes or records, and some
people take their own.There is a       
snooker table and a pool table to play 
on, and there are two table tennis     
tables.Some people sit and play cards  
with their friends.Chris sells crisps, 
sweets,pop,coffee and tea at a counter.
Sometimes there are special trips by   
coach to places like Alton Towers or   
Blackpool.It costs 20p to join and 10p 
for each meeting.                      </content>
