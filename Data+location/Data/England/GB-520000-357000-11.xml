		<title>11TATTERSHALL CASTLE</title>
		<content> The original Tattershall Castle was   
 built in{1231}by Robert de Tateshale. 
 That's how the castle and the village 
 got its name. The castle was extended 
 by{Ralph Lord Cromwell}in{1440.}In    
 1573_1693 the Earls of Lincoln lived  
 in the castle.                        
  It was opened to the public in{1914  
 on{ 8th August}when owned by Lord     
 Cromwell.He replaced the fireplaces   
 for which it was famous. Lord Cromwell
 restored the castle and put in        
 concrete floors and roof.             
 In 1925 it was bequeathed to the      
 National Trust.                       
{In 1984 they had 27,779 visitors.}In  
 1984_1985 they took the concrete roof 
 off because it was too heavy which    
 made the beams sag so they put a      
 timber roof on covered with asphalt.
