		<title>02Housing, Uppingham, Rutland</title>
		<content> It is proposed to build 44 houses on  
 the Old Mill Site,Ayston Road,        
 Uppingham, just within the            
 southern boundary of the project      
 area.It is thought that this site had 
 previously been bought for Â£190,000   
 which was about Â£80,000 per acre _a   
 local record.The Rutland and Stamford 
 Mercury of 26 April 1985 reported a   
 special planning committee meeting    
 about the site under the heading {    
{Building Density is too high.}Concern 
 was reported about the density of     
 houses , the filling in of the        
 adjacent brook,the future maintainance
 of the area, and other environmental  
 factors.                              
 Building of 42 houses was finally     
 agreed in July 1985, as reported in   
 the Rutland and Stamford Mercury of   
 12 July 1985.
