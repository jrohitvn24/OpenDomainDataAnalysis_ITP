		<title>10Sennen Easter Fair</title>
		<content>  On April 6 we had an Easter Fair . In
 the morning the boys took part in a   
 football competition. First I went on 
 an inflatable bouncer brought by      
 Breadline. I had five or six ice      
 creams. About 12 o clock we had a hat 
 and egg competition. Claire Preston   
 and Beverley Lawson won the hat       
 competition. I have forgotten who won 
 the egg competition. I entered for the
 hat and egg competition but I did not 
 win anything. Next I went in and      
 watched Punch and Judy which was very 
 good. There were many Brownie games   
 there and my  friend was lucky on all 
 of them. The prizes were lollies. We  
 had computers in Mrs Taylors classroom
 and lots of people enjoyed playing on 
 them. At the end of the Easter Fair we
 had enough money to buy a video       
 recorder for our school.
