		<title>15Windmill Hill</title>
		<content> Windmill Hill was already so named in 
 the eighteenth century.  It was       
 probably the site of a timber post    
 mill.  This, in turn, may have been   
 erected on an ancient burial mound    
 similar to the "Toot" in West         
 Bradley.                              
 The name "Baltonsborough" probably    
 refers to such a "barrow" and Wind-   
 mill Hill, the highest point in the   
 parish, is a likely location for such 
 a barrow.                             
 Remains of a supposedly medieval      
 tunnel, 4' wide and 6' high, with a   
 barrel roof and partially paved floor 
 have been found on the west side.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
