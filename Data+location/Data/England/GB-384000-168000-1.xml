		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION,CORSHAM</title>
		<content>   The D-block area includes most of   
 the town of Corsham as well as the    
 villages of Rudloe and Neston.        
   Rudloe is largely residential with  
 few facilities. Most of the people who
 live there work in the Forces or the  
 Civil Service. Neston is also largely 
 residential but has more of a village 
 atmosphere.                           
   Corsham itself has a population of  
 some 12,000. The oldest parts of the  
 town have many beautiful and historic 
 buildings. The town grew rapidly      
 during the Second World War and still 
 has army, navy and airforce bases     
 nearby. Over the last ten years the   
 town has grown rapidly again with the 
 building of new housing estates and a 
 light industrial trading estate. There
 is a pedestrian precinct for everyday 
 shopping and an increasing number of  
 specialist shops in the High Street.  </content>
