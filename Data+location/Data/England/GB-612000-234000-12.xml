		<title>12150 Years of Stutton School</title>
		<content> For a week in July, Stutton School    
 turned the clock back to 1835 to      
 celebrate its 150th Anniversary. We   
 dressed in Victorian clothes and      
 followed the curriculum of that time. 
 We had drill, copywriting, reciting of
 tables, arithmetic, religious         
 instruction and maypole dancing. On   
 the Tuesday, television and press     
 cameras were buzzing around us. We    
 walked from school to the church where
 we met the Bishop who led a service of
 thanksgiving for the school. The      
 dinners at school were nice. We had   
 gruel, ham, pickled cabbage, bread and
 cheese. The tables were set in lines. 
 We were not supposed to talk. There   
 was an exhibition in the school hall  
 with lots of photographs, pictures,   
 clothes and other items from the last 
 150 years. This was a very exciting   
 week.                                 </content>
