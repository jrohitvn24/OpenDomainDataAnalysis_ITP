		<title>16EAST OGWELL CHURCH</title>
		<content>   Kelly's Directory of Devon for 1926 
 says:{"The church of St.Bartholemew is
{a building of mixed styles and various
{dates,consisting of Chancel, Nave,    
{Aisles, South Porch and an embattled  
{western Tower containing five bells." 
 The church is peaceful and very pretty
 inside.It is usually decorated        
 with flowers.The only sound is the    
 birds outside, except when the Rector,
 Rev.Geoffry Watts is taking a service.
    I am a member of the church choir. 
 There are twelve of us, both boys and 
 girls, and we sing at the morning     
 service every Sunday. We have Choir   
 Practice on Friday evenings. We       
 usually sing hymns and psalms but     
 sometimes we learn special anthems.
