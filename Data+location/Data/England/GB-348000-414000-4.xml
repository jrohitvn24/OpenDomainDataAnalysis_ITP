		<title>04Young mother, Mawdesley</title>
		<content>    We interviewed a mother who had    
recently moved into the village, to    
find out how she liked living here.    
    She has lived here for eight       
months. She lives in a detached house, 
with her husband and two children, aged
ten and nine, who attend the village   
school. Although she likes living in   
Mawdesley, she does not take part in   
village activities but takes a keen    
interest in parents' activities at     
school.                                
    The family used to live in a town, 
and now enjoy the peaceful atmosphere  
of the village. The biggest            
disadvantage of living here is the     
lack of public transport. Most things  
are available at the local shops, but  
when "big" shopping is necessary, the  
family go by car to Southport.
