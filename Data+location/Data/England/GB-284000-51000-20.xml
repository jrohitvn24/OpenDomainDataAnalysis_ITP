   The owner of Capton farm is also a  
 local councillor and vice chairman of 
 the{Dartmouth Enterprise Group.}The   
 group is presently organising a       
{community bus service}which will serve
 the local{hinterland}of Dartmouth.    
   Initially one 17 seater bus will be 
 put into service on the 17th          
 August, opened by the Minister of     
 Transport. Several drivers are being  
 trained and licenced to P.S.V.        
 standards and will operate the buses  
 voluntarily.                          
   The bus will deliver farmers and    
 villagers to their doors, following   
 a route through Dartmouth, Blackawton 
 and Dittisham.  Fares are expected to 
 be half the normal service rates.
