 Dunster lies on the edge of Exmoor,   
 encircled on three sides by steep     
 wooded hills, the fourth side  forms  
 part of a flat coastal strip, across  
 which the river Avill flows into the  
 Bistol Channel.                       
 Four factors contribute to a          
 settlement being built up at Dunster: 
 the local geography, the river Avill, 
 the castle and to some extent the     
 Priory.                               
 Dunster is one of the villages which  
 are typical of England as it used to  
 be, for it is one of the finest       
 examples of a medieval village or     
 small town left in the West Country.  
 Many tourists visit it every year yet 
 it has still managed to remain        
 virtually unspoilt.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
