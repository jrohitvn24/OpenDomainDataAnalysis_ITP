		<content> We asked some children to think of    
 places you could go to visit in just  
 an afternoon from Woore.              
 The nearest place was the{Bridgemere  
{Wildlife Park,}where you could see    
 lots of birds and animals and have a  
 picnic.                               
 In Stoke there are places like the    
{Gladstone Pottery,}or{Chatterley      
{Winfield Mine.} Or you could go to    
{Trentham Gardens.                     
 If you just wanted to look at an old  
 historic town, you could go to{Chester
 or{Nantwich}or{Shrewsbury.            
 If you are interested in Space, you   
 could go to{Jodrell Bank Observatory. 
 If you want to see a film, the best   
 place to go is{Hanley.                
 The place that most children would    
 like to go to is{Alton Towers. }It is 
 not very far, but you would need to   
 spend all day there to enjoy it all.  </content>
