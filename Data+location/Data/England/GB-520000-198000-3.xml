		<title>03MOTORWAY CARAVAN SITE</title>
		<content> I LIVE ON BALFOUR BEATTY SITE.        
 THE SITE IS FOR THE FAMILES WORKING ON
 THE MOTORWAY CONSTRUCTION.THE SITE HAS
 ROUGH GROUNDS AND BEHIND MOST OF THE  
 CARAVANS THERE IS GRASS.IT IS SMALL   
 AND STONEY.LIVING IN A CARAVAN IS     
 RATHER GOOD THEY ARE TIDY JUST LIKE A 
 HOUSE.MOST CARAVANS HAVE GAS AND      
 ELECTRICITY WHICH LETS YOU COOK.THE   
 ONLY THING WRONG WITH LIVING IN A     
 CARAVAN IS YOU CAN ONLY TAKE HOME MORE
 THAN TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THERE
 IS NOT VERY MUCH SPACE.THE CARAVANS   
 ARE NICE INSIDE THEY HAVE A KITCHEN,  
 DINNING ROOM,BEDROOM AND A TOILET.I AM
 ON THE SITE BECAUSE MY STEPDAD IS     
 WORKING ON THE SITE AND IF HE DID NOT 
 TAKE THE JOB HERE IN SOUTH MIMMS HE   
 WOULD NOT HAVE A JOB AT ALL.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
