		<content>  On the better drained lands around   
Frieth most of the land is arable. The 
predominant crop is barley though some 
wheat is being grown. Other fields are 
used for hay or silage. Down in the    
valley and on the lower slopes much of 
the land is pasture land, mainly grazed
by dairy cattle. In the higher part of 
the valley around Turville, arable land
is more prominent, including a large   
acreage of rape.                       
  Below Frieth a small herd of Highland
cattle was grazing rough pasture.      
Started as a hobby, and to help keep   
the grass down, the herd has grown     
because the cattle bred so well.       
Economically not profitable, although  
producing good beef, butchers are      
loathe to handle them, and so offer low
prices.                                
  Farming is highly mechanised and so  
the labour force is small.             </content>
