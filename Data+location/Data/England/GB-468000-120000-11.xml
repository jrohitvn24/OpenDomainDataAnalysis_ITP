		<title>11A FARMER'S DAUGHTER'S DAY</title>
		<content> On a week day I have to be up at 7.00 
 to be ready for the school  bus at    
 8.30.I feed my pets before dressing in
 school uniform.After breakfast my     
 brother and I walk down the road to   
 wait for the bus.School starts at 9.05
 with registration;lessons stop at     
 12.10 for lunch then continues at     
 12.55 until 3.20 when school closes.  
   We arrive home a little after 4.00.I
 usually have about 1.5 hours homework 
 each night.Afterwards I watch         
 television or listen to records (Iron 
 Maiden are my favourite).As I live 5  
 miles out of Petersfield it's not easy
 to see my friends.I read and watch T.V
 a lot.Although I live on a farm it    
 doesn't interest me very much  though 
 I do talk to the cows when I walk over
 Park Hill to East Meon.On Saturdays I 
 have riding lessons.
