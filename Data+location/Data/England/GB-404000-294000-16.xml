		<content> There are several blocks of sheltered 
 flats in our area. Some of them are   
 owned by the private Servite Houses   
 Ltd, an independent registered charity
 started in 1944, so called because the
 first block built was on land owned by
 the Servites. Residents have to be of 
 retirement age and reasonably         
 able-bodied. The cost per week is     
 about Â£30 for a single flat, Â£32 for a
 double, including rent, general rate, 
 water rate, service charge, all       
 heating and domestic hot water, use of
 common room and laundry. Special      
 facilities provided include alarm     
 cords in every room and poles by      
 toilets and baths for extra support.  
 Near the common room there is a       
 warden's flat in which alarms ring so 
 help is available day or night. Some  
 flats have separate entrances while   
 others are entirely under one roof.   </content>
