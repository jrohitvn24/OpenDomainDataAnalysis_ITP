		<content> Formed in 1886,Belford F.C. will hold 
 various social functions in the coming
 centenary year.The 1st team play in   
 the Northern Amateur League,which     
 involves a lot of travelling in the   
 Newcastle district.The 2nd team play  
 in the North Northumberland League.   
 Various fund_raising efforts help to  
 maintain the 2 teams and pay for a new
 pavilion and changing facilities.The  
 Club has had a lot of success over the
 years,reflected by the large number of
 trophies won by the players.          
 Belford Cricket Club was formed at the
 end of the last century,and,after     
 promotion last season,is now playing  
 in the Northumberland B1 League       
 despite problems in finding enough    
 players,due to the fact that farm     
 workers have difficulty in getting    
 time off.The players themselves carry 
 out any necessary pavilion repairs.   </content>
