		<title>09PLAY PLACES AND GAMES</title>
		<content>   In Borough Green we are very lucky  
because we have many {places to play}. 
We have two {recreation} grounds. Then 
there is Tollgate Green, and some of   
the {estates} have large carparks where
we can play on our bikes. There are    
also woods and wasteland where we play 
hide- and-seek and make camps.         
   Many of us play {games} which       
involve bikes, roller-boots and        
skateboards. We play these on the      
pavements. Some boys play B.M.X.       
biking.    We like to make up {games}  
like shops, ghosts, banks, schools,    
doctors, nurses and hospitals, and     
detectives which we play in the camps  
we make.    It is mostly boys who play 
in the woods and on wasteland.         
Sometimes they play in new houses that 
are being built on two new {estates}.
