		<content> A small school with just two classes  
 having approximately 20 children in   
 each class. The new entrants stay in  
 the first class from reception to top 
 infants, ages 5,6,7.The second class  
 is for the junior ages that is 8,9,10.
  Most of the children live in the     
 village and walk to school but a few  
 living at Halton West or outlying     
 farms are brought to school by        
 minibus.                              
  The two classroom areas are seperated
 by a large school hall and each has   
 its own cloakroom and toilet          
 facilities.There is an additional room
 which serves as a library,T.V.room,   
 junior art room and provides a quiet  
 space for individual or group         
 activities.                           
  At the age of 11 the children        
 transfer to Settle Middle School.
