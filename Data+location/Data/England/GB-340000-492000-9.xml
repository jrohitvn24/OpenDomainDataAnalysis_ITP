		<content> Several houses have been made by      
 converting barns, some very neat to   
 keep the traditional exterior. One is 
 Spigot House, an old homestead with   
 barns on either side converted in to a
 whole very pleasant to look at and    
 live in. The house at Knipe Tarn is a 
 good example; traditional on the      
 outside, modern and well appointed in 
 the new shell, and done by a person   
 who has used the old house as a       
 holiday home for some time, and now   
 will retire there to lovely and       
 peaceful surroundings, and will no    
 doubt integrate in the local community
 in time to come. There are known to be
 23 cottages and flats to let in the   
 village, and many more on the         
 outskirts , in the disused farms. This
 is a good use for old deserted farms
