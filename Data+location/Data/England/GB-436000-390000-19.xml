		<title>19M1 Tinsley Viaduct Sheffield</title>
		<content>  In Feb. 1965 the Transport Ministry  
 announced the design for the two level
 elevated structure which carries the  
 M1 Motorway on the upper level and an 
 all purpose Trunk Road on the lower.  
 The viaduct spans the Don Valley at   
 Sheffield crossing the Sheffield  -   
 Keadby Canal, the Don and a network of
 railways.                             
  The 3388ft. long viaduct is divided  
 into 20 spans supporting two levels by
 a box girder construction. Subsequent 
 investigation found this type of      
 structure to be defective,            
 consequently the viaduct was partially
 closed upon its completion in 1969.   
  Strengthening tests resulted in      
 inverted triangular trusses supporting
 the upper deck. Although the cost has 
 risen from an estimated Â£4m. to over  
 Â£10m. the viaduct is still not fully  
 operational.                          </content>
