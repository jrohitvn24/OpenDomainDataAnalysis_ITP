		<title>05WATER SUPPLY HORNBY</title>
		<content> Hornby Castle has its own water       
 supply.The supply feeds the castle,   
 the gas works and many of the houses  
 in Hornby village.The water comes from
 a spring in the field opposite Park   
 Chase.The spring has never dried up   
 even in draught years.The water is    
 very clear and very hard.It is piped  
 across the field to the pump house.   
 A small pipe from here used to feed   
 a stand pipe in Hornby village.The    
 two hydrams pump the water to the     
 reservoir which is several fields away
 on higher ground.The reservoir holds  
 8,000 gallons of water and is 8 feet  
 deep.The water falls by gravity to the
 Castle and other houses.Recently The  
 nitrate content of the water has risen
 as a result of the nitrate fertilizers
 put on the farmland being absorbed by 
 the rain water.
