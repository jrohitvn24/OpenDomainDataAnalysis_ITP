		<title>04       Minor Roads.</title>
		<content> Although much work and money has been 
 spent in widening and straightening   
 the busier main roads, the minor      
 country roads which serve the{villages
 in this area are typical.  Junctions  
 and dangerous corners are marked with 
 signs and white paint, but there are  
 no rows of{"cats'-eyes"}to show the   
 middle of the road width.  These      
 reflect the lights of cars at night   
 like the eyes of a cat that glow.     
                                       
 There are many places where it is     
 difficult for two cars to pass each   
 other and entrances to{houses}and     
{factories}are often extra wide to make
 it less dangerous to pull in or out of
 the driveways.                        
                                       
 There is less{street lighting}except  
 where there are villages and grass at 
 roadsides is not cut as on main roads.</content>
