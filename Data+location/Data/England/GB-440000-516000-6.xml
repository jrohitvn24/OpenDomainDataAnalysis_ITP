		<title>06The Castle Eden Walkway</title>
		<content>    The Castle Eden Walkway follows the
 path of what was originally the Castle
 Eden Railway line.   It has been      
 developed as a public footpath and    
 cycleway.                             
    The walkway provides the people of 
 Stockton with a pleasant "country"    
 walk through a fairly densely         
 populated part of the town.   The     
 hedges at either side of the walkway  
 hide the houses from the view of the  
 stroller, or cyclist, and thus give   
 the illusion of being in the          
 countryside.   The Castle Eden Walkway
 also provides a habitat for a large   
 variety of plants and animals which   
 would not otherwise be found in this  
 urban environment.
