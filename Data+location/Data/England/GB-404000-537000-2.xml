		<title>02Housing in Wolsingham</title>
		<content> There are three main types of{housing 
 in Wolsingham.The oldest houses are   
 stone built with slates or pantiles.  
 Some of these buildings are listed:   
{Demesne Hall,}the old rectory, stands 
 in its own grounds,while{Bombay House 
 is on the main road.                  
{  Lynndale}and{Ferndale}are Council   
 estates,built in modern materials.    
{Lea Green}and{Riverdale}are two of the
 new private developments.At{Gateways, 
 people have built their own homes.    
   Wolsingham is a blend of old and new
 and has increased in size in recent   
 years but without reaching the peak of
 population attained last century when 
{lead mining}was a major Weardale      
 industry.                             
 Some older properties are neglected   
 and are subject to{vandalism.
