		<content> In the area, sport and recreational   
 facilities are based around a leisure 
 centre. Bramcote squash and swimming  
 complex cost Â£240,000 to build in     
 1965.                                 
 In 1973 it opened a health suite which
 includes sauna, squash courts and a   
 swimming pool. A spa pool was added   
 and a synthetic five a side football  
 pitch was built costing Â£20,000. Also 
 in 1984 an aquaslide was assembled.   
 Approximately six to seven thousand   
 people visit the leisure centre each  
 week. The sauna is used mainly by     
 adults in their thirties and there    
 twice as many children as adults who  
 use the pool. Since expansion of the  
 facilities, several new jobs have been
 created.
