		<content> We went to visit Mr Arthur Reeder. He 
 lives on Chilwell High Road and       
 collects old traction engines. He also
 had a cart and a 1932 lorry called Big
 John. He used to have a steam-roller  
 called Katie.                         
 We went inside a big organ he owns. He
 showed us how the organ worked and a  
 brown car which was made in 1928.     
 He takes the organ in the back of a   
 'Plessey' van and takes it to shows.  
 He had to sell his steam roller       
 because he had asthma and the steam   
 upset him.                            
 He was a very interesting man to talk 
 to.                                   
                                       
                 Meadow Lane School.
