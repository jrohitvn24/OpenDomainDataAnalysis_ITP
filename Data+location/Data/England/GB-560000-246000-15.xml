		<title>15THE VILLAGE POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> P.C.99 has been a policeman for nearly
 25 years. He lives in a police_house  
 in the centre of the village of       
 Horseheath, although he is based at   
 Linton Station.He works 8 hour shifts,
 and averages a 40 hour week. He says  
 the 'pros' of being a police officer  
 are"The money is quite good, it is    
 pensionable after 25 years , and the  
 accommodation is free. The            
 disadvantages are basically the       
 unsociable working hours."P.C.99      
 reports that Horseheath is a very     
 pleasant village to live in, and      
 people treat him as a friend and      
 neighbour. His two teenage daughters  
 however, find it boring, with not     
 enough to do in the area.He has only  
 chased anyone as a traffic officer,   
 has used his handcuffs very seldom,   
 but has made several arrests during   
 his career.                           </content>
