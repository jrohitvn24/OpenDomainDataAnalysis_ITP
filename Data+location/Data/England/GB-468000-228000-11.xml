		<title>11EMPLOYMENT IN PADBURY</title>
		<content> There have been vast changes in       
 employment patterns in villages such  
 as Hillesden and Padbury during the   
 last 50 years.Before the Second World 
 War there was a railway station in    
 Padbury,five or six pubs,two          
 bakeries,two general stores,a         
 blacksmith,cobbler,carter,            
 undertaker and joiner and numerous    
 farms requiring much labour.There is  
 now very little employment to be found
 within the village.Opportunities      
 consist of two shops,a small          
 workshop,a builders yard and some     
 domestic employment for local         
 women.There are some jobs on local    
 farms .In Hillesden the pattern is    
 very similar but the results are more 
 severe.There is now no school,no      
 shop,no pub and only one bus a week.  
 There are very few jobs locally and   
 virtually everybody works elsewhere.  </content>
