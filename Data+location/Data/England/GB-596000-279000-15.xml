		<title>15HOBBIES IN HOPTON</title>
		<content> The people of Hopton like to have a   
 hobby to occupy some of their spare   
 time.  The most popular hobbies for   
 ladies are knitting jumpers, scarves, 
 socks and baby clothes; walking or    
 horse riding in the countryside;      
 reading magazines and books; watching 
 television; doing jigsaw puzzles;     
 sewing clothes and tapestries; drawing
 and going to play Bingo in nearby     
 villages.  Some people try to spend   
 time each day on their hobbies while  
 others have to wait for "a rainy day".
 Others prefer to collect stamps or    
 shells or wild flowers for pressing.  
 Men often have less time to pursue    
 hobbies, but their interests lie in   
 visiting local pubs, watching sport   
 on television or gardening especially 
 vegetables for their own families.    
 Some find time to play cricket in the 
 summertime at the local village club. </content>
