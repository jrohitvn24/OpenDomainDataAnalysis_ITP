		<content> The village of Teignwick became       
{Highweek}and remained a small viilage 
 community until about 25 years ago    
 when it was absorbed by the rapidly   
 spreading Newton Abbot. The fields to 
 the south west were sold as building  
 land and the newest part of Newton,   
{Bradley Barton.}Newton Abbot itself is
 two medieval market villages,{Newton  
{Abbot and Newton Bushell.}The land    
 mark that is Newton's symbol is{      
{St.Leonard's Tower.}It was once a     
 church but unfortunately in 1835 the  
 nave was demolished to give traffic   
 better access. In{1688}when King      
 JamesII was forced to flee the country
 the new monarchs,{William and Mary}   
 landed at Brixham and travelled to    
 Newton, proclaiming their rule at the 
 tower. The Tower remains, now part of 
 a one-way system, complete with litter
 bins, plaque, and seat!               </content>
