		<content> At the far side of the school playing 
 field we have an adventure playground.
 It was built by fathers of children   
 who came to Bunny school in 1980.The  
 parish council look after it. In our  
 adventure playground there are six    
{beams}joined together in a cross shape
 and you balance on them. We enjoy     
 walking up the{spiral stairs}they look
 like a rocket. There are wooden{poles 
 to walk up like a flight of 4 steps.  
 There are also two{steel poles}hanging
 in a tall frame, they are used for    
 climbing up.A large{net}is stretched  
 across a frame, it is very strong.We  
 have two{swings}and a climbing pole   
 with feet grips each side. There are  
 some{metal bars}to swing on and lastly
 there are some old{logs}on which the  
 infants play. At the side of the      
 playground is a long jump{sandpit}and 
 sometimes the children play there.    </content>
