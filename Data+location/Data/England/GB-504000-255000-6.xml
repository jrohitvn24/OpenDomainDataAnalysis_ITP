		<content> Some scientists reckon that adding    
 fluoride to the water supply can be   
 harmful to elderly people's bones and 
 organs.Other people think that it is  
 the best way to strengthen children's 
 teeth. In places where fluoride is    
 added to the water supply children's  
 teeth are much healthier. In          
 Birmingham where it has been put in   
 the water for the last 20-25 years,   
 the local dental hospital has to find 
 its patients from outside the area,   
 because so few children in Birmingham 
 have dental disease. Another problem  
 for the water authority is caused by  
 farmers who spray their crops with    
 chemicals which soak into the ground  
 when it rains. They eventually end up 
 in our water supply and may affect our
 health. Big filter machines could be  
 built to remove the impurities, but   
 they would be expensive to install.   </content>
