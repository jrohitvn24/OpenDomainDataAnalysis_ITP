		<title>04River Medway  Part 1</title>
		<content>  The river{Medway}is a major influence
 on the lives of the surrounding       
 villages. To regulate the flow of the 
 river the{Leigh Flood Barrier}was     
 built. The flood barrier was built    
 to stop floods in Tonbridge because   
 they were very drastic. In 1968 there 
 was a terrible flood when water came  
 up to the first windows and up to the 
 engines of the buses. The barrier took
 a long time to build because they had 
 to ask Lord de L'Isle for his         
 permission to flood the land. It was  
 opened in 1981, and it has been used  
 seven times since then. When they     
 close the barrier to stop Tonbridge   
 getting flooded, Penshurst gets       
 flooded instead. It does not matter   
 too much for our village because we   
 have countryside, but Tonbridge is a  
 big town with shops.
