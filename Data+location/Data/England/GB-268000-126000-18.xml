		<title>18How We Did It!</title>
		<content>  Our teacher put us into groups of    
 about three or four people. Then we   
 thought of subjects and put them on   
 the board. Like, for instance, pets   
 and each group chose which subject    
 they would like to do about. Our group
 did about food. For about three times 
 a week each group tried to produce    
 something about their subject. But    
 first we could write questions for    
 other people in the school to answer  
 if we wanted. We put down questions   
 about what our group was doing and    
 then the rest of the school answered  
 them on a questionnaire. Then we did  
 writing about that and fed it into the
 computer. We went on some walks, one  
 to the Industral Estate and another   
 near the Chipboard Factory. We also   
 had to count all the amenities in our 
 area like hospitals, and this was     
 shared out between our groups.        </content>
