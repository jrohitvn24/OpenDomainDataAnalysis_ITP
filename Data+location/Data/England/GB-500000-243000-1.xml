 Introduction to the area              
                                       
 The D block is mostly covered with    
 fields.The crop that mostly grows in  
 the fields is corn.In the north west  
 corner of our D block is{Wootton}     
 village which covers approximately one
 square kilometre.Most of the eastern  
 part of our D block is covered by     
 disused clay pits.At{Kempston         
{Hardwick}there are brickworks and the 
 seven tall chimneys can be seen for   
 miles around.There are two railway    
 tracks running from the north to the  
 south through our D block.There are   
 two main roads running through our D  
 block from north to south.They are    
 the A421 and the A418.
