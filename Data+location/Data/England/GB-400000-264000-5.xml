 The children stand in a circle around 
 the swinger who holds a rope. The     
 swinger swings the rope around at     
 ground level while the others have to 
 jump over the rope. If the rope hits  
 someones legs they become the new     
 swinger.

 Find a partner and face each other.   
 Clap your own hands together, then    
 clap your partners. Clap together     
 again then clap opposite hands.       
 The first one to go wrong is the

 spaceships. Then we have battles with 
 the figures and spaceships. We put

 the string and have battles there.    </content>
