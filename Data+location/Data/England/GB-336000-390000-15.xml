		<content>  Most trade is carried out through    
 retail outlets run by one man located 
 along main roads. The majority sell   
 food. Non_food shops supply all the   
 area requires to maintain it's life   
 style, including equipment needed for 
 leisure pursuits.Each shopping area   
 has at least one shop that provides   
 ready_to_eat food. Where there has    
 been rebuilding during the last       
 fifteen years, supermarkets and       
 precincts cater for local population. 
 It's still possible to find small     
 groups of stalls set up in the open   
 air. The wholesale fruit, veg. and    
 flower market supplies retailers from 
 all over Merseyside and North Wales.  
 The Stanley Abattoir, a wholesale meat
 market, supplies butchers. Cash and   
 Carry wholesalers supply retailers    
 with preserved and frozen food and    
 some non-food items.                  </content>
