		<content> North Bedfordshire now has a three    
 tier system of Lower, Middle and Upper
 schools.                              
 The Yelden village school is no longer
 in existence. The children are bused  
 out of the village to Riseley Lower   
 School.(which is a church school of   
 about 120 children) or they may attend
 Eileen Wade School at Upper Dean      
 (which has about 20 children)         
 At the age of 9 they transfer to      
 Margaret Beaufort at Riseley and at 13
 they attend Sharnbrook Upper School.  
 If parents do not want to use the     
 State system and are prepared to pay  
 and to transport their own children   
 there are a number of private schools 
 to choose from in Bedford,Kimbolton   
 and Wellingborough.                   
 There is a Playgroup at Pertenhall    
 which runs twice a week and a mums and
 tots morning for under 3's.           </content>
