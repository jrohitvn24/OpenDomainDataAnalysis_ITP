		<title>15Ravenstock Farm  (II)</title>
		<content>    In their spare time they like to   
 play sports of various kinds like     
 tennis, golf, swimming and            
 windsurfing.                          
    They have quite a few machines,    
 such as a combine harvester, a drill  
 and a grain spreader. The combine     
 harvester is used for cutting the corn
 and it has a spout on the side through
 which the grain is loaded into the    
 lorry that comes by the side of the   
 machine. The combine harvester that   
 belongs to that farm is the latest    
 kind and has a very complicated       
 dashboard. The drill is used for      
 keeping the seeds in rows when they   
 are being sown.                       
    A harvest can fill a barn up to    
 twelve feet deep and a person can walk
 along the top and tell by the feel of 
 the grain underfoot how dry it is. But
 that isn't a very safe thing to do.   </content>
