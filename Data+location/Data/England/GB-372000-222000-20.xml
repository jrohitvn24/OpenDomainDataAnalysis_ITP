 These are based around the community  
 buildings, the church rooms, the      
 school, both of which are in Tibberton
 and the village hall. These activities
 include the Womens Institute, a       
 Keep-Fit club, Cubs, Brownies, Scouts,
 a Play Group, Sunday School which is  
 held every other Sunday morning and   
 there is a local Football Pitch and a 
 Tennis Club which can be used by the  
 community.                            
 Anybody needing a Doctor or Dentist   
 has to travel to either Newent of
