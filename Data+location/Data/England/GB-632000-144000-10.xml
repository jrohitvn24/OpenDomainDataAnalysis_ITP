		<title>10WEST CLIFFE HAMLET</title>
		<content> West Cliffe is a fine example of a    
 settlement little changed by time.    
 Originally an 8th century name,the    
 hamlet appears in the 1086 Survey as  
 Westclive. At this time the land was  
 worked by "17 villeins" and oddly     
 there are exactly that number of      
 people living there today. There is a 
 small church (St.Peters)which holds 2 
 services a month. 2 centuries ago the 
 services were only held monthly. As   
 regards other buildings there is still
 1 farm. A second,Walletts Court,closed
 10 years ago and recently reopened as 
 a smart family guest house and        
 restaurant with 7 bedrooms. There are 
 3 other houses,8 barns,6 sheds and 1  
 garage. On the Survey day there were  
 7 cars in the village. These enable   
 the villagers to get to Dover to shop.
 Few villagers ever use buses. The     
 quiet is valued by the residents.     </content>
