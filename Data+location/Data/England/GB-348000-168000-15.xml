		<title>15BACKWELL GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> In the past, Backwell had many mine_  
 shafts, as coal reserves were large.  
 There were a lot of miners' cottages, 
 all together in terraces. Coal was    
 soon exhausted though, and the mine_  
 shafts fell derelict. Backwell had    
 many orchards and some survive today. 
 A few old wells can still be seen.    
  Backwell is quite large now. There   
 are lots of footpaths and the fields  
 are arable or pasture. A railway line 
 runs through the countryside. There is
 a lake and along the lanes there are  
 hedges and trees. Altogether          
 Backwell's countryside is peaceful.   
  Backwell could become smaller soon,  
 because houses in nearby Nailsea are  
 being built and spreading towards     
 Backwell. More people will enter the  
 area bringing children. A new school  
 will have to be built and a new name  
 needed.Backwell's future is uncertain.</content>
