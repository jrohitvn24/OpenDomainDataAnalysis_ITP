		<content> The development of Wareham today has  
 spread well outside the old walls.  If
 the area of Northport is included,    
 half the town buildings are now       
 outside it's ancient walls.  During   
 the l920's and 30's there was a lot of
 infilling.  Within the walls, over{   
{seventy percent of the buildings are  
{listed as being of special            
{architectural and historical interest.
 There is little industry within the   
 town which is given mainly over to    
 tourism.  At Northport a small        
 industrial estate has begun to        
 flourish bringing in smaller          
 businesses.  The main offices of {East
{China Clay}are situated in Wareham and
 are involved in the extraction of     
 large quantities of clay. {Gravel     
{extraction}is also a major industry.  
 Most of the local firms are involved  
 in service industries.                </content>
