		<title>04Health Care in Southam</title>
		<content>  In 1985 Southam residents are well   
 looked after health-wise. Babies are  
 taken to a local clinic where they are
 regularly weighed and checked.        
  Children are checked at school and   
 see a school dentist as well. There is
 a dentist in the town and also a      
 modern doctor's surgery. Anything     
 serious is referred to the hospitals  
 in Warwick and Leamington.            
  Older people can be cared for at home
 or in a residential home. At home a   
 nurse will visit an old or ill person.
 A home help will do the shopping and  
 the housework and hot lunches can be  
 delivered four days a week.           
  There are two homes providing        
 sheltered accomodation for elderly    
 people in Southam. The residents have 
 a comfortable flat each.              
  A blood doning unit visits the town  
 four times a year.                    </content>
