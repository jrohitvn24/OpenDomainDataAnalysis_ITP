		<title>03BRISTOL HORFIELD PRISON</title>
		<content> Horfield prison was opened in 1883.In 
 1967 and 1976 they added wings to the 
 prison to make  572 cells. Now the    
 prison can hold 669 prisoners         
 including long term prisoners. These  
 are the sort of jobs they do in       
 prison, they have work from, post     
 offices, hospitals, playgroups,       
 Ministry of defence, private firms and
 manufacture clothing and equipment for
 prisoners. The majority of prisoners  
 are employed on piece work, a few are 
 paid on  flat rate (they get paid on a
 weekly or monthly basis.) In prison   
 you can take your O and A levels, so  
 when you leave you have a better      
 chance of a job. Now the Horfield     
 prison is badly over_crowded and they 
 are taking over some more premises in 
 the area.The planned prisoner's hostel
 is causing concern among the          
 residents.                            </content>
