		<title>12BOVINGDON BAPTIST</title>
		<content>      Mr. Webster is the lay pastor of 
 Bovingdon Baptist church. The Websters
 have been at Bovingdon Baptist for 18 
 months. When they came, the church was
 just about to close. It only had three
 members who could not keep the church 
 going. Mr. Webster originally came    
 from Bushey but took early retirement 
 and joined the preaching team in      
 Bovingdon. On October 18th 1983 Mr.   
 Webster was baptised.                 
      About 35 people go to a normal   
 meeting on Sunday morning. There are  
 ten juniors. There are 50 people in   
 all that come. But there are only 7   
 committed members. When Mr. and Mrs.  
 Webster first came there were only    
 3 members in the church all in their  
 70's and one was born on Christmas    
 Day. The people who go to the church  
 are mainly from Bovingdon.
