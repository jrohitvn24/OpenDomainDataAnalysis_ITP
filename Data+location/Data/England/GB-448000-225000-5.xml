		<content> There are two main concentrations of  
 housing in the area. In the south east
 there is a large amount of military   
 housing built along one side of the   
 Upper Heyford air base. Mainly this   
 consists of bungalows.The housing is  
 modern having nearly all been built   
 within the last ten years.            
 These houses are exclusively for the  
 use of United States airmen and their 
 families.                             
                                       
 To the west of this on the side of the
 Oxford Canal is the smaller village of
 Upper Heyford.                        
                                       
 The remainder of the area is          
 uninhabited apart from a few scattered
 farmhouses.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
