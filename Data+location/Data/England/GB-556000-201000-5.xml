		<content>   Braces has been the site of a wood  
 yard since 1926.It changed very little
 until 1960 when the erection of a new 
 building began on the lower half of   
 the site.The firm deals in British and
 foreign timber,hardwood and softwood. 
 The home produced hardwoods are mainly
 Oak,Elm,Ash,Sycamore and pine.Fir and 
 Scotspine being the softwood.The      
 largest imports are Lroko from west   
 Africa,Mahogany from Brazil and teak  
 from Burma.They also have wood from   
 U.S.S.R,Scandinavia and North America.
 There are two types of kilns used for 
 drying timber.A dehumidification type 
 and a vaccume type{(one of the latest 
{and up to date methods).}The wood can 
 stay in a kiln from 7 days to 3 months
 to dry properly.A joinery shop on the 
 site now produces windows and doors.  
 The saw mills are to be replaced in   
 the next year or two.                 </content>
