		<title>09SALLINS FARM-PICKLESCOTT</title>
		<content>   One of the nicest farms our school  
 visited whilst staying at{Lower       
{Darnford}farm house was{Sallins Farm},
{Picklescott.}                         
   It was owned by Mr and Mrs Morris   
 and had an area of 156 acres.It is one
 of the highest farms in Shropshire,at 
 1150 feet.                            
   The farm is fairly typical of most  
 farms in the area,catering for mainly 
 dairy and 72 beef cattle.What made the
 farm different from the others that we
 visited was that it had a{computer }  
 which kept records of how much milk   
 each cow produced,when they calved,   
 when they were ill and how            
 much food the cows ate each day.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
