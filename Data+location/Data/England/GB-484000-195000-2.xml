		<content>    Although the Ordnance Survey lists 
14 farms in this area only 4 remain as 
working farms,ranging from Downley     
Farm of 173 acres,worked by the 3      
Hounslow brothers as tenant farmers    
for 46 years,to the Dashwood-Kent      
partnership,formed in 1981,of 1800     
acres centred on Cookshall Farm but    
including much land in surrounding     
"D" blocks.                            
    The D-K farms have 1100 breeding   
ewes with 40 Suffolk rams from which   
they obtain 2000 lambs for fat lamb    
production while Downley Farm's 22     
ewes produce lambs for the meat market 
with the help of a hired ram!The       
fleeces from both farms are taken to   
the Wool Staplers (Pearce) in Thame,   
the centre for the collection of       
fleeces for the whole of southern and  
south-western England.Here they are    
graded and sold to woollen factories.  </content>
