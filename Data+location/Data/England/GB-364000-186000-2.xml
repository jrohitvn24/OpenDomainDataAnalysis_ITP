		<title>02INTRODUCTION TO TYTHERINGTON</title>
		<content> The small village of{Tytherington}is  
 situated to the{south-east}of{        
{Thornbury}at a place where 5 roads    
 meet. This has led to an unusual      
 settlement pattern.                   
{Tytherington}is a quiet village.      
 There is a lovely assortment of       
 charming detached cottages made of    
 a warm brown stone. Behind the        
 houses are ornate gardens. To the     
 north -west the buildings rise up     
 in a slope named{Tytherington Hill}.  
 There is a sharp contrast between the 
 quietness of village life and the busy
 activity of the nearby working{quarry.
 People love living in{Tytherington    
 because there is hardly any trouble   
 and it is a pleasant and friendly     
 atmosphere, set in an attractive      
 landscape, despite the{M5 motorway}   
 running close to the village.
