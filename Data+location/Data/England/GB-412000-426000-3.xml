		<title>03THE PEOPLE OF WYKE</title>
		<content>   The majority of people living in the
 area are of European origin, but being
 part of Bradford with its multi-ethnic
 background most races are represented.
 Most of the coloured people in Wyke   
 own shops, the Pakistanis and Indians 
 owning newsagents and grocery shops,  
 whilst the Chinese run hot food       
 take-aways.  A large number of Asian  
 children are bussed into the area to  
 attend Wyke Manor Upper School.       
   Although Wyke and its surrounding   
 area is now a satellite of the ever   
 growing city of Bradford, it still    
 retains something of a village        
 identity and most people are very     
 satisfied with the services and       
 amenities provided locally and close  
 to in the City Centre.
