		<title>18CROPS IN L. STAUGHTON</title>
		<content> Some winter monoculture is practised, 
 but a large proportion of the area    
 includes a break crop in              
 rotation,especially winter oilseed    
 rape, obvious in the early summer     
 months due to its bright yellow       
 flower,with some winter and spring    
 field beans and harvest dried peas.   
 There is little permanent or temporary
{grassland.}There are virtually no     
{sheep}and very few beef cattle. There 
 are at least two small{dairy herds,   
 predominantly Friesian. There is      
 little evidence of intensive{pig}or   
{chicken farming}in the area. .        
 Other farming activities include some 
 relatively small scale{vegetable      
 growing, particularly brussels sprouts
 and potatoes. There is a{goat farm    
 situated in Little Staughton, famous  
 for its pedigree milking herd.
