		<title>09Housing in Sampford Courtney</title>
		<content> As Sampford Courtney is designated a  
 Conservation area,there is relatively 
 little new housing.A few newer houses 
 are found at Sampford Chapple.The main
 village,mostly cob and thatch,is as it
 was when built in the Middle Ages.    
 A few of the farms in the centre of   
 the village are now just houses and   
 their outbuildings have been converted
 into dwellings and sold.              
  Cob,the main building material,      
 consists of well sieved mud           
 mixed with straw and small stones.It  
 was built up in sections 12-18 inches 
 high.It was better preserved when     
 whitewashed as in the old days than   
 the modern cement rendering which     
 cracks and lets in water. New owners  
 have re-thatched old thatch,or        
 corrugated iron which had replaced    
 it.Council grants are now available   
 for this, which must be a great help. </content>
