		<content>  The area on the side of the main     
 railway line from Leeds to York is    
 where industry is to be found.It is   
 called Hornbeam Park.There are many   
 firms on the site which was once      
 occupied solely by ICI fibres.We went 
 to ICI fibres.Once they had 2 500     
 working there but because of recession
 the work force was reduced to 400     
 people only.They made sure that people
 who were sacked got another job or    
 retired.The site is very pleasant &amp;   
 quiet.We visited Stanleys Toffee.     
 Stanleys Toffee employs 22 staff.They 
 make rock &amp; smarties and other sweets 
 for other firms. The manager says it  
 is a good site because it looks over  
 green fields.They have their own      
 pottery. They have orders every week  
 from places like Lightwater Valley &amp;  
 Harewood House.In one day Stanleys    
 Toffee makes 112lb of boiled sweets.  </content>
