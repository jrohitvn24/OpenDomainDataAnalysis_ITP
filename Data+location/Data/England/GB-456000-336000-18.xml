		<content>    After school, many of us go to     
 clubs or organisations on certain     
 nights of the week. Several boys go to
 Cubs. They wear special green jerseys 
 and green caps. They play games and   
 learn First Aid and do work to get    
 proficiency badges. Just recently some
 of the Cubs went to camp and had to   
 cook their own food!                  
    Many girls are Brownies. They wear 
 a brown dress with a yellow tie and a 
 brown hat. They also work for badges  
 and play games. Every year they have a
 pack holiday.                         
    Some of the girls go to dancing    
 lessons. They learn tap, modern and   
 ballet dancing. They wear a leotard   
 and tights. They work for special     
 exams and each year they put on a show
 for parents and friends.Other children
 go to swimming clubs, ice-skating or  
 to learn to play musical instruments. </content>
