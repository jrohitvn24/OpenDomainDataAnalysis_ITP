		<title>02Nether Stowey:Castle Mount</title>
		<content> The dominant hill rising on the south 
 west edge of Nether Stowey and called 
 the Castle Mount is the remaining site
 of a 'motte and bailey' castle. It can
 be approached by Castle Hill on one   
 side and from Mill Lane on the other. 
 It was built for a Norman baron and   
 later belonged to the family of Lord  
 Audley, who was executed by Henry VII.
 It was finally destroyed in about 1497
 and the stones were used to build a   
 new home at Stowey Court for the      
 Audley family. There are enough       
 foundations of the castle left to see 
 where the ground floor rooms were     
 situated. At the foot of the hill     
 is the mill stream, near to Audley    
 Close. From the top of the Mount are  
 fine panoramic views of the Bristol   
 Channel, the Mendip Hills and         
 Glastonbury Tor. The Mount, now owned 
 by Mr Dinham, is used for grazing.    </content>
