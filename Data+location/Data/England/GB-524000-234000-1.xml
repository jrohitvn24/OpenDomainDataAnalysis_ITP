		<title>01Rural Area N.E. of Baldock</title>
		<content>  This block has about 0.5 sq.km. of   
 N.E. Baldock in the S.W. corner, which
 is mainly residential, but with some  
 commercial and industrial functions.  
                                       
  The remainder of the block is        
 undulating chalk country, overlain    
 by clays, and intensively farmed for  
 arable crops.                         
                                       
  Many people living in the block do   
 not work there, but commute to nearby 
 larger towns such as Stevenage or even
 to London.                            
                                       
  This rural area is poorly served by  
 bus services and there are few        
 amenities of any sort, even in Baldock
 itself, the main part of which is just
 S.W. of the block.
