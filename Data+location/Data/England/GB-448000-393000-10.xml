		<title>10Ravenfield Village</title>
		<content> The old village is a{quiet place}which
 has changed a little bit but not much.
 On the main road it hasn't changed but
 on some backroads there are lots of   
 new houses.Down the road there is{St. 
{James church.}Some people call it the 
{'Bull and Bush',}because the man who  
 owned it had a pub called the Bull and
 Bush in London.The church has{ogee    
{shaped windows}and a{steeple.}It was  
 built in{1756.}The{clock}has{one hand.
 There are some{fish ponds}near the    
 village and you need a special permit 
 to fish there.{Ravenfield Common}has a
{tennis court,a garage,a post office   
 and{a public house.}I like the village
 and I would very much like to live    
 there when I am older. I enjoy fishing
 so I could walk down the road to the  
 fish ponds. I think I would need some 
 form of transport because the nearest 
 shops are at Ravenfield Common.       </content>
