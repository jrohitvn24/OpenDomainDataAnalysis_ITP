		<content>       The area consists of gently     
 undulating chalkland with small       
 scattered streams. As there is little 
 in the way of housing, industries and 
 roads, the landscape consists of mixed
 woods, grassland and arable farmland. 
                                       
       The area has just two villages -
 Chawton and Farringdon. In both       
 villages the housing styles vary from 
 thatched dwellings several hundred    
 years old upto modern homes. Modern   
 development is extremely limited as   
 both villages are in designated       
 conservation areas where strict       
 planning laws apply.
