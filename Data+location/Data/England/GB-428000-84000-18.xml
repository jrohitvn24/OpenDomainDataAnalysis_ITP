		<title>18ALUM BAY SANDS / NEEDLES</title>
		<content>  The Alum Bay sands were formed by the
 stones and shells from millions of    
 years ago and by the tide they got    
 washed into the shore.Because the     
 cliff was there they could not push   
 into it, so they built their way up   
 and made coloured sands from the      
 different minerals.                   
          THE NEEDLES                  
  Once there was a fourth rock at the  
 Needles,but the tide crumbled it      
 away.Now it is under the sea.The      
 Needles used to have a lighthouse on  
 the cliffs at Scratchells Bay but it  
 got knocked down.It was wooden.At the 
 wooden lighthouse,the keeper got      
 thrown over the cliffs by smugglers.  
 The new lighthouse is based on        
 granite,the granite is too hard to be 
 washed away.
