		<content>{ Rochester}probably derives its name  
 from the presence of the{Roman station
 of Bremenium,the remains of which lie 
 half a mile North of the village. Its 
 military associations remain as the   
 Ministry of Defence has built         
 Redesdale Army camp just West of the  
 village.                              
{Rochester is situated 37 miles from   
{Newcastle upon Tyne and 10 miles from 
{the Border on the busy A68}trunk      
 road.This is one of the main routes   
 into Scotland and a large volume of   
 traffic passes through, including     
 tourist cars,long_distance buses,     
 transport vehicles and a number of    
 army vehicles en route to the camp and
 firing range. The whole of the area   
 lies within the{National Park}and is  
 one of rugged natural beauty preserved
 by the farming community.Tourists     
 passing through often stop again.     </content>
