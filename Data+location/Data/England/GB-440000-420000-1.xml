		<title>01Review of Featherstone</title>
		<content> Featherstone is a mining town in west 
 Yorkshire,west of Pontefract and built
 as a linear settlement along the      
 B6421.In 1971 it had a population of  
 15242.There have been 2 coal mines in 
 the town,Featherstone main colliery   
 which was closed after the 1926 strike
 and the Ackton Hall colliery closed   
 July 4th.1985 following the recent pit
 strike.Coal is still being produced   
 from an opencast site.                
 Featherstone is famous for the Rovers 
 Rugby League team which is manned by  
 local lads many of them mine workers. 
 There have been urban renewal and     
 housing improvement schemes,but there 
 have been few  miners coming into the 
 town from outside areas.              
 North Featherstone and Ackton are     
 villages which have grown with estates
 being built there.
