		<content> As you approach the sandstone church  
 you will see a tree lined track       
 leading up to the lych gate which is  
 made completely out of wood.On your   
 right will be a yew tree which        
 incidentally is about 350 years old.If
 you go down the track you will see the
 clock tower.The bottom half of the    
 tower is 800 years old and the belfry 
 is 600 years old.If you turn right you
 come to a porch  and then through a   
 12th century doorway into the nave.In 
 the North aisle is a lady chapel and a
 great organ.The Church held a flower  
 festival in June but it may become an 
 annual event.Various parts of the     
 church were beautifully decorated by  
 local organisations,the Scouts, the   
 school,the W.I. etc..Lots of visitors 
 came to the church during the flower  
 festival and some came from the other 
 side of the world.                    </content>
