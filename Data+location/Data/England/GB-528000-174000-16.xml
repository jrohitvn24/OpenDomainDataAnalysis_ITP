In our survey of parents at our school 
we found that most shopped twice or    
three times a week in the large        
supermarkets and added to this with    
items from the local small shops. There
are many eating places for meals out-  
Chinese Restaurants,Curry centres,Fish 
and Chips shops,Steak Houses,Cafe's for
quick Burgher and Chips meals and fresh
cut sandwich bars. There are also      
several take-away shops; Chinese and   
Indian where you can order a meal for  
any number and collect it all ready for
serving - hot and in silver foil.
