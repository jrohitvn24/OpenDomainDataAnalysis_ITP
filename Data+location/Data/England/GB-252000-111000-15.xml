		<content>     Many British families enjoy the   
 company of a pet or pets and the      
 people of{Merton}are no exception.

 called Lucky.He is a black and white  
 cat.My mum feeds him twice a day."    
                                       
     Some families have space for even 
 larger pets.                          
     Jamie Standen writes---"Our horse 
 is mostly kept outside but at night   
 he comes in his shed and has his      
 barley."                              
                                       
     Other families who live on farms  
 have the opportunity to keep more     
 unusual pets.

 got a pet duck called Donald.It sits  
 on my knee and I give it 1 or 2 slices
 of bread and some pigmeal."
