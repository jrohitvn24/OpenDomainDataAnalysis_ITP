		<title>11The River Stour, Bryanston</title>
		<content>{  The Stour}was widened and moved from
 its course through Bryanston; the old 
 course can be seen near St Martin's.  
 From above the Boathouse to the weir  
 is a km stretch used regularly by the 
 School Boat Club, training in eights, 
 fours &amp; sculls. Canoeists from the    
 School &amp; Blandford also use the river.
 Bathing used to happen regularly.     
   The river is fished for eels,roach, 
 pike,dace &amp; less common fish - tench, 
 trout,bream &amp; carp. Salmon have again 
 been seen leaping the weir, suggesting
 the river is now less polluted than it
 was. Mink are common along the banks. 
   Anglers &amp; boat users conflict on    
 occasion, but the Stour's main problem
 is the{Blandford Biting Fly,}unique to
 the area.The fly breeds in the river &amp;
 delivers a bite which can be painful &amp;
 temporarily disabling. 1985 was a bad 
 year.Eradication attempts have failed.</content>
