		<content>   Although there have been claims that
 an Abbot built a church on this site  
 around 900 A.D. most of the present   
 church of Saint John the Evangelist   
 was built between 1215 and 1300. Later
 additions include a spire, a new roof 
 and the clerestory.                   
   Among the interesting architectural 
 features are a sixteenth century      
 sundial, two corbells showing         
 Elizabeth 1st and a famous Abbot. The 
 nave is one of the most beautiful in  
 the country.                          
   There are sixteen excellent corbells
 on the south aisle dating from 1450,  
 beside this is a thirteenth century   
 piscina.                              
   A handsome spire was added to the   
 church in 1664, also there is a very  
 beautiful window covering the east    
 wall.                                 
                                       </content>
