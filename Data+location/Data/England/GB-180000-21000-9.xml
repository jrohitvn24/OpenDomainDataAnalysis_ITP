		<content>{        THE PARISH HALL}              
 This hall which was recently built now
 provides a focus for much of the      
 village life and serves as a centre   
 for local entertainment and           
 organistion.                          
    The Parish Hall has a management   
 committee with a chairman and 8       
 elected members, a booking secretary  
 and a caretaker.  It is used for      
 wedding receptions, parties, whist    
 drives, council meetings, badminton,  
 auctions, indoor markets, concerts and
 St.Keverne Young Peoples' Club (SKYP).
 This is held every Thursday except in 
 school holidays.  The younger members 
 use the hall first followed by the    
 teenagers.  An annual pantomime is    
 held here performed by the St. Keverne
 Kaudlers. Discos are supervised by 1  
 or 2 of the management committee. The 
 Church Synod also meet here annually. </content>
