		<title>19Religion in Dean</title>
		<content> The focal point of Upper Dean is the  
 church.                               
 It is now in group of 6 churches - the
 Stodden churches comprising, Dean,    
 Melchbourne, Pertenhall, Shelton,     
 Swineshead and Yelden - with 1 vicar  
 who is resident in Dean.              
 There is a family service with        
 Communion at 10am on Sunday at each   
 church in turn. At this service there 
 is usually a "Sunday Club" and creche 
 for the younger members of the        
 congregation. A choir has now been    
 established to perform on several     
 occasions throughout the year. There  
 is also an early service and evensong 
 so that in most instances every       
 village has a service of some kind    
 each Sunday.                          
 There is also a Chapel in Dean that   
 holds services in the Old Schoolroom  
 fortnightly.                          </content>
