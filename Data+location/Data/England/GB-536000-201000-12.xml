		<content>  Police have to wear certain uniforms.
In summer they wear a short sleeved    
white shirt,black shoes or boots.They  
wear either a tall hat for walking and 
riding, but if they are driving they   
would wear a black flat hat with black 
and white checks.The women wear a flat 
white hat with black and white checks, 
a skirt and a shirt.                   
 When police work they usually have    
certain times, either night shift or   
if on a home beat they would work about
eight hours.When Police have a home    
beat it means they have a certain area 
in which to patrol including their home
which is usually about two miles by one
mile.Most police if on a home beat     
would walk or cycle but otherwise they 
would be in a Panda car or even a      
Police van.
