		<title>15St. Mary's Church, Ince.</title>
		<content>Close to Ince Cemetery is the Anglican 
Church of St.Mary. The original church,
dedicated in 1887, was erected at the  
corner of Warrington Road and Clarendon
Street about 100 metres to the south of
the present church. Over the years the 
ravages of mining subsidence, which    
affects large areas of Ince and Wigan, 
substantially damaged the once splendid
red brick building. This eventually    
proved so devastating that in 1978     
the church had to be abandoned and     
demolished. The congregation moved into
temporary accommodation in the nearby  
St. Mary's Primary School. This Victor-
ian building also needed extensive     
repairs and the children and staff had 
already moved into other more modern   
premises. Part of the building was     
later converted into the present church
not as grand as the old St. Mary's per-
haps, but certainly just as attractive.</content>
