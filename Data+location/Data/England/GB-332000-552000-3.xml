		<content> There are 10, two and three bed-      
 roomed houses on the Custy Steps      
 estate. The remaining 6 homes are     
 bungalows built especially for        
 pensioners. In 1981, the Impact       
 Housing Association, built 7, two     
 bedroomed bungalows for pensioners.   
 This estate was named Moor Close in   
 recognition of the work of one of the 
 Parish Councillors and school         
 governers. Many of the remaining      
 houses date back to the early 1800's  
 or even earlier, but there are several
 modern bungalows which have been built
 during the last 20 years, often by    
 their owners. Four new houses are in  
 the process of erection and when      
 completed, will be known as Mid-Town.
