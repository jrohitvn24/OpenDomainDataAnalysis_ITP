		<title>12Great Coxwell Church</title>
		<content> The 12th century stone built church of
 St.Giles stands on high ground near   
 the centre of the village.The church  
 has an early 16th century brass to the
 Morys family.The churchyard is closed 
 and burials take place in an adjacent 
 piece of land.Heating was installed in
 1979 and restoration work was carried 
 out in 1982,mainly to a crack in the  
 tower.At this time the exterior rend- 
 ering was removed.There is a ring of 5
 bells,regularly rung by the village   
 bellringers.Rev.Robert Swanborough,   
 vicar since 1980,also preaches at     
 Coleshill,Buscot &amp; Eaton Hastings.With
 diminishing congregations,he may not  
 be replaced upon his retirement.
