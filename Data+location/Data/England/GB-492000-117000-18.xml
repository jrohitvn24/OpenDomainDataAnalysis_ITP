		<title>18POLO HORSES IN GRAFFHAM</title>
		<content> There are 20 polo ponies cared for by 
 6 grooms and a manager. The best polo 
 mares are put to thoroughbred         
 stallions &amp; the young ones are broken 
 in at 3 years &amp; play in matches at 5  
 or 6. Their manes are clipped off once
 they have proven themselves on the    
 polo ground. Their teeth are checked  
 twice yearly, wormed every 6 weeks, &amp; 
 vaccinated for tetanus every year, &amp;  
 shod every 6 weeks when working. Studs
 are put in the hind shoes to prevent  
 slipping. In September they are turned
 out for the winter &amp; brought back in  
 February. The manager plays polo &amp;    
 prepares the youngsters for practice  
 chukkas in the spring. When choosing a
 pony he looks for the right           
 temperament, athletic ability &amp; size, 
 which is very important. They must be 
 about 15 hands high. He plays at      
 Cowdray Park.                         </content>
