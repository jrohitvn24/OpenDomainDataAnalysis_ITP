		<content> The Mexborough Community Policeman.   
 There are lots of jobs in the police  
 force and one of them is the job of   
 the community policeman. We talked to 
 our community policeman and asked him 
 questions about his work. He explained
 about his experience at his job, and  
 we learned how he mingles with people 
 in the town and gets to know them     
 well. He can arrive at the scene of   
 any trouble before it develops any    
 further or before it even starts. He  
 knows many individuals personally and 
 many people know him by sight and by  
 name. They also know where to find him
 at home.                              
 In Mexborough library there are       
 posters that say "This is your        
 community policeman" with a photo     
 underneath and his name and address.
