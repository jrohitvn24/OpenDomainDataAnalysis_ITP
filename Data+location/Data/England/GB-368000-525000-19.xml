		<title>19PENSIONER 80+ OF KNOCK</title>
		<content> She feels proud &amp; priviledged to live 
 in the village where the people are   
 genuine &amp; helpful &amp; united in their   
 continual battle against the elements;
 winter snows &amp; the Helm wind.         
 She feels that having no bus service  
 has brought the community closer      
 together by encouraging them to share 
 lifts into the town.She finds the     
 local paper invaluable for keeping up 
 with the "goings-on" round about.She  
 is never at a loss for things to do &amp; 
 thinks that time seems longer without 
 the distractions one meets in a town. 
 Keeping her house &amp; garden neat &amp; tidy
 is a pleasure to her.                 
 She thinks that the holiday makers    
 have brought a variety of different   
 people into Knock &amp; enjoys talking to 
 them.
