		<title>20Holiday cottages in Blockley</title>
		<content>     Mr Greenstock has lived in        
 Blockley for twelve  years. He chose  
 Blockley to buy a hotel and now owns  
 six holiday cottages which he has won 
 awards for.All his cottages are       
 self-catering.He has one cottage that 
 holds two people, two cottages that   
 hold four people,two cottages that    
 hold fivepeople and a large cottage   
 that holds six people.                
       The cottages are open for the   
 whole year but the main season is from
 Easter to October when they are very  
 busy. During the winter they are still
 very busy but people come for shorter 
 stays.Four weeks is the most you can  
 rent a cottage for.                   
       It is cheaper in the Winter.It  
 is about 50 pounds for a weekend. In  
 the Summer for the same cottage  it is
 about Â£250 pounds for a week.
