		<title>15TIME CAPSULES IN HOOK</title>
		<content> A time capsule is a strong waterproof 
 box containing items of interest about
 things at a particular time which is  
 then buried for say 5 years.In my     
 plastic bag,inside an ice cream box,I 
 put a tape of my voice and one of this
 week's Top Twenty,some writing about  
 myself,such as height,measurements,   
 hand and foot prints.I wrote about my 
 main hobbies and interests and about  
 all the changes taking place in{Hook. 
 I put in other things such as copies  
 of the Gazette and Hart Observer,     
 a list of my best friends and a map of
 present day{Hook.}Lots of people have 
 done the same as me so there are bound
 to be boxes buried all over the place 
 which some will forget for ever.Where 
 I buried my box is my secret otherwise
 it wont be there in 1990 when I will  
 open it.I hope some new houses or a   
 road are not built on my treasures.   </content>
