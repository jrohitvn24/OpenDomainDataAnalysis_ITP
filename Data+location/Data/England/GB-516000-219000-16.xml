  Sometimes I go for another bike ride 
 before lunch.I have my lunch over my  
 Grandad's as well.When my cousin is   
 here we often go for a walk down to   
 the river Mimram or we go to the Bury 
 with Ferny,my cousin's dog.With my    
 cousin sometimes I go down a pathway  
 that has got lots of trees in and we  
 feed some goats that are there.       
  When we get back home we sometimes   
 play outside or sometimes we watch    
 television.I also have my tea at my   
 Grandad's then I go home have my hair 
 washed then I watch television for a  
 while then I go to bed.
