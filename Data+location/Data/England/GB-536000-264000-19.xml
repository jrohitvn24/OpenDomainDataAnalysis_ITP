		<title>19LONGSTANTON FEAST</title>
		<content>    A long-standing village tradition  
 is Feast Week, held, since Victorian  
 times at least, during the third week 
 in June. The custom died out for a    
 time but was revived six years ago;   
 since then Feast Week has been        
 organised by the Sports and Social    
 Club.                                 
    Preparations begin six months      
 ahead and fifteen or twenty people are
 involved. Events include various      
 sporting activities and competitions, 
 and a fete on the Saturday afternoon. 
   Profits are shared equally between  
 the Sports and Social Club and the    
 groups promoting individual events.   
 The Sports and Social Club currently  
 uses this income to pay off the loan  
 raised for their Pavilion. The        
 maximum profit in the last six years  
 has been Â£900; this year the profit   
 was Â£600.                             </content>
