		<title>10ROYAL ASCOT LADIES DAY</title>
		<content> On Thursday of Royal Ascot Week it is 
 Ladies Day.On this day all the ladies 
 dress up in fancy hats and dresses and
 the men wear top hats and tails.The   
 Queen also comes on this day along    
 with many of the Royal Family.Many    
 famous people like Terry Wogan,Bruce  
 Forsyth and Matthew Kelly come along  
 too.That week there were a lot of     
 helicopters taking people to and from 
 the Races.Most people come to the     
 races for enjoyment.It turns out that 
 almost everyone comes by car,but a few
 came by train.We found out that a     
 majority of people have been coming   
 for more than 10 years.Most people    
 spend up to Â£50 on their day at       
 Ascot.Quite a few people bet on the   
 horses but not many spend over        
 Â£50.Peolpe had come from all over the 
 world to the races.
