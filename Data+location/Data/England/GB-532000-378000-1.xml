		<title>01LAND SURVEY</title>
		<content>      Although the land survey suggests
 that the area is covered by large     
 arable fields, there is quite a       
 variety of land cover, some covering  
 areas of significant size but         
 occupying sections of more than one   
 block.  They include a large area of  
 old pasture land, fields which are    
 rotated from arable to grassland for  
 sheep, several small areas of woodland
 and one large steep-sided valley which
 is quite uncultivated called Deepdale 
 Firs.                                 
      Set in the Lincolnshire Wolds, an
 area of hilly chalkland, it is a very 
 undulating area with a high point of  
 117metres and a low point of 50metres,
 quite belying the common misconception
 that Lincolnshire is a flat county.   
      When the fields are ploughed the 
 various colours of chalk can be seen  
 on the hillsides.                     </content>
