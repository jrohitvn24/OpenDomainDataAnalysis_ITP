 the{Mid Devon Star.}The Star is free

 the columns on{births, coming of age, 
{congratulations, marriages and deaths

 what has happened to people they      
 know.The local newspapers are very    
 important for{advertising}and many    
 firms advertise their goods and       
 services. Ordinary people can         
 advertise in the{under Â£25}bargain

 column is very popular. The papers    
 also tell us what is on at the{local
