		<title>20WOODLESFORD STATION</title>
		<content> The station was opened about 1900 by  
 the L.M.S. Co. with 18 regular staff. 
 It had a private siding to Bentley's  
 Brewery. During the 2nd World War the 
 staff was increased to 26 as all wines
 &amp; spirits came into brewery and most  
 beer went out by rail. Extra lorries  
 and horses were stabled at Woodlesford
 to deal with this traffic. There was  
 also a private line to the Water Haigh
 Colliery and Armitage's Brickworks,   
 thousands of tons of coal, etc. left  
 each week. A considerable amount of   
 specialised oil for aircraft engines  
 left Ragosine Oil Co. by rail every   
 day during the war. The introduction  
 of diesel passenger units with guards 
 taking fares caused the station to    
 become unmanned in 1968. The station  
 is now mainly used by commuters to    
 Leeds, approx. 120 per day, the peak  
 hours being 07.00/0900 and 1600/1800. </content>
