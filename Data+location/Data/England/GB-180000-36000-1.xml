		<content>    The area we are surveying for the  
 1985 Domesday Project,includes the    
 villages of Mylor and Feock,          
 Restronguet Creek and a large part of 
 Carrick Roads,(the estuary of the     
 River Fal). The area contains mostly  
 agricultural land with some wooded    
 areas and small village comunities.   
                                       
    We chose to concentrate on the     
 Mylor area because it was within the  
 catchment area of our school and the  
 children of the village attend the    
 comprehensive school in Penryn.       
                                       
    Mylor has increased dramatically   
 since World War 2.13 housing estate 4 
 shops and 2 council estates have been 
 built.Also roads and the bridge have  
 widened.There has been a major boom in
 Mylor in recent years as an area for  
 the elderly.                          </content>
