		<title>04THE RED LION PONTESBURY</title>
		<content> The Red Lion is a public house in     
 Pontesbury.  The Landlord works from  
 8.00am until 3.30pm and again from    
 6.00pm until 12.00 midnight, clearing 
 up and leaving things ready for       
 opening time.  Opening times are      
 ll.30am to 3.00pm and 6.30pm to       
 ll.00pm, when drinks and hot or cold  
 meals are served. Any extension of    
 these hours has to be applied for at  
 the court in Shrewsbury. There is one 
 other person to help prepare the food 
 and then wash up.                     
 Over recent years there has been a    
 drop in trade due more to people      
 drinking at home, than the drink/drive
 laws.                                 
 The Landlord is connected with the    
 Shrewsbury and Wem breweries and so he
 buys all his stock from them.         
                                       
                                       </content>
