		<content> The soil structure of the area is of a
 strong silt, grade 2 as defined by the
 Min. of Ag. The crops grown are wheat,
 barley, oats,sugarbeet, rape and peas 
 (for drying)the sugarbeet is          
 contracted out but all the other crops
 are harvested by the farmers.The farm 
 has 100 cows 'calves which  are sent  
 for fattening up for beef.The farmers 
  keep a hundred cattle on the farm,   
 which is  1100 acres.                 
      The farmers drain their fields to
 keep them dry.Every year the drains   
 are checked and new drains are put in 
 where they are needed. Hedges have    
 gone because they spoil the drainage  
 though around the large grass fields  
 some are kept.Some trees have been    
 planted in the spinney.               
      Fertilizers and weedkillers are  
 used and the farmers think them safe  
 if they are used well and not by air. </content>
