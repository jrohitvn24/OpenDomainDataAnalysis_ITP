		<title>18ELDERLY PEOPLE IN BOGNOR</title>
		<content> There are many elderly people living  
 in the area.  They come{to retire}in  
 Bognor, because of the sea and        
 peaceful atmosphere. Some come to live
 or stay in{rest, convalescent and     
{nursing homes.} Some come to be near  
 their families in their retirement.   
                                       
 Doctors and clergymen spend much of   
 their time caring for elderly people. 
 One advantage of living in the area is
 that it is very flat and easy to get  
 around.  Shops are close by and there 
 are activities for older people.      
                                       
 There are many small houses and       
 bungalows, suitable for retired       
 people.  Kings Haven, a home for      
 elderly, mentally handicapped people, 
 has been built on land originally     
 intended for an infants school.
