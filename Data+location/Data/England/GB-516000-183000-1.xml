		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF WEMBLEY</title>
		<content>   Most of our block is in the{London  
{Borough of Brent,}with a small area in
 the south-west corner,in L.B.Ealing.  
                                       
   The area is predominantly           
 residential with most of the houses   
 being built in the 1930's of two-     
 storey,terraced or semi-detached      
 construction.There are also a few     
 light-industrial estates producing    
 mainly small components.              
                                       
   The world famous {Wembley Stadium}is
 also within our area, along with the  
 Wembley Arena and Conference Centre.  
                                       
   Passing through we have sections of 
 the {Grand Union Canal,}the main {    
{London-Euston Railway}line to         
 Scotland,the{A40}( London to Fishguard
 via Oxford ) and the {North Circular  
 roads.                                </content>
