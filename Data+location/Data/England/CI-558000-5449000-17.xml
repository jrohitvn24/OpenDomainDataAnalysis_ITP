		<title>17BROWNIES AND GUIDES</title>
		<content> One hobby in our area is Brownies and 
 Girl Guides.  You start Brownies at   
 the age of 7 and leave to go to Guides
 at 10.  The leader of the Brownies is 
 called Brown Owl and the helpers are  
 named after animals.  When you have   
 just joined Brownies you are known as 
 "Tweenies" until you are enrolled by  
 giving this promise:{I promise that I 
{will do my best, To do my duty to God,
{To serve the Queen and help other     
{people and to keep the (Brownie) Guide
{law.}You leave Guides at 15 and then  
 you can go to Young Leaders or        
 Rangers.  Our leader at Guides is     
 known as Captain.  As a Guide you can 
 go camping, go on cook-outs and hikes.
 A cook-out is when you are outside and
 you cook on an open fire, and of      
 course you can do interest badges at  
 Brownies and Guides.
