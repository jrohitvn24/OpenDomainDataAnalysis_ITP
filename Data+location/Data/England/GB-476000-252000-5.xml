		<content> The house built 1791 replaced the     
 former Elizabethian House demolished  
 in 1793. Humphrey Repton designed the 
 new parkland and Samuel Saxon was     
 engaged as architect. The House, a    
 three storey cube built of local      
 limestone with greyer Weldon Stone for
 the base is a good example of Regency 
 architecture. The internal friezes and
 plasterwork are particularly fine.    
 Usage of rooms remains the same       
 although several small rooms on the   
 ground floor have been modernised ie. 
 kitchen, study. The outbuildings,     
 originally kitchens &amp; servants        
 quarters have been converted to       
 garages, offices &amp; utility rooms. The 
 Palladian Stables built 1760 have been
 converted into a family house.
