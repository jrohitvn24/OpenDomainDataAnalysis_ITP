		<title>09THE GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content> Just off the main A.120 Dovercourt    
 by-pass lies the only{golf course}in  
 the area which is a popular form of   
{recreation}for visitors as well as    
 locals.It has an{interesting past     
 having been originally built for      
 Officers stationed in the area during 
 the First World War.After the war was 
 over it was made into a proper golf   
 club, and at the moment of writing has
 a total of{276 members}including one  
 member who comes from Belgium, and the
 sister of the present Prime Minister  
 Mrs. Thatcher.                        
  The secretary told us that the{9 hole
 course measures 2929 yards, and covers
 an area of 34 acres. We think it would
 be a good place to play for children. 
 There are{junior members,}who enjoy   
 playing.
