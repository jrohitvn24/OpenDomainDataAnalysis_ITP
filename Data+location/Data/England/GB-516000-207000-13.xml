		<title>13LOCAL INDUSTRY:ST.ALBANS</title>
		<content> Just off Hatfield Rd. on the outskirts
 of St. Albans are three small         
 industrial estates. These are Acrewood
 Way, Lyon Way and Alban Park. We      
 visited some of the many different    
 companies such as Case, who deal with 
 banks and department stores, Lacre,   
 who manufacture commercial vehicles,  
 and Trumpf, who make machine tools.   
 Some more companies are Kelter Plant, 
 who hire out big machines and tools   
 and Kas Graphics who make and sell    
 printers. There are also a number of  
 other industries at the opposite end  
 of Hatfield Road,near Fleetville.     
 Marconi Instruments make electronic   
 test equipment for communications and 
 for circuit board production. Next to 
 them is Laver's timber yard which has 
 been on that site for 100 years. It is
 a family business stretching back for 
 six generations.                      </content>
