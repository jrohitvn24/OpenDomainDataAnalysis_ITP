		<title>01MY DAY - SATURDAY 29TH JUNE</title>
		<content> I woke up at 8.25 a.m.  I had a wash  
 and got dressed.  I had a breakfast of
 Bran Flakes and toast.  I went round  
 Christopher's and we went for a bike  
 ride around the green.  When we got   
 back I had to serve petrol for a      
 little while (because I live in a     
 garage).  After that we started to    
 make a go-kart.  We looked around for 
 some wood and after a while we found  
 some and made a go-kart, all except   
 for the wheels because we did not have
 any.  We have put a card in the shop  
 window.  After that we rode around on 
 our bikes thinking of something else  
 to do.  Then we rode home because we  
 had to have tea.  I had sausages,     
 chips and peas.  After that we went   
 into Attleborough to change some      
 videos.  When we got back it was about
 7.10 p.m.  I watched Cannonball Run 2 
 and went to bed at 9.45 p.m.          </content>
