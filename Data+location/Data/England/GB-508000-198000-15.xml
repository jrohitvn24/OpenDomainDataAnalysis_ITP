		<title>15A Watford Dad's day at work.</title>
		<content>Dad is a printer and he works at       
Croxley Mill just outside Watford.     
Watford has been famous for printing   
but ODHAMS has closed and part of SUN  
printers may close soon and they were  
the two main companies.  Dad does      
shift work. When he does a day shift   
he works from 5.00am until 6.30pm      
while night shifts are 5.30pm until    
5.30am.  His job at the mill is to cut 
the paper.  He lifts and feeds the     
paper into the cutting machine and it  
comes out the right sizes at the other 
end ready to be stacked.  The          
machinery is electric and can be       
dangerous.  Once a man went through    
the machine and was killed.            
Many of the paper mills owned by DRG   
have closed in the last 5 years.  Many 
of them used to get all their raw      
material by canal and send away their  
finished product in the same way.      </content>
