 We sent a questionnaire to all the    
 people living in our D-block, using   
{electoral rolls}for three{parishes.   
 We had a 45% return.There were 135    
 people in our survey.Most of them are 
 in the 31-60 age group.The rest       
 are spread over the remaining age     
 groups.Most people and their parents  
 were born outside Cornwall.The        
 majority of people have lived in our  
 D-block for less than five years.Most 
 people travel eleven miles to shops   
 and banks.Two thirds of our sample go 
 to the{cinema}and{theatre             
 occasionally.One half of the families 
 surveyed use a{library}eleven miles   
 away.Most people either work on farms 
 or are retired.
