		<title>09THE RIVER TRENT</title>
		<content> The{River Trent}flows through the     
 section diagonally from SW to NE with 
 a lock beside{Nabbs Island}near{      
{Hazelford Ferry.}It is a fast-flowing 
 river with a small wooded escarpment  
 on the SE bank.  Where the river winds
 away from the escarpment, it leaves a 
 considerable area subject to flooding.
 The river bed is regularly dredged to 
 a depth of at least 8 feet, and down  
 to 17 feet in places.  The dredged    
 material is taken by barge to         
{Gunthorpe,}washed, graded and sold as 
 aggregate which is used for making    
 roads. The{Trent}was once a very busy 
 commercial waterway, but this traffic 
 has virtually ceased.  It is now used 
 by pleasure craft particularly in the 
 summer months when up to 300 craft per
 week pass through the lock.
