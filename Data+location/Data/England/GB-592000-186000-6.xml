		<content> THE TYPE OF FARMING THAT TAKES PLACE  
 IN OUR AREA IS TYPICAL OF THAT OF     
 SOUTH EAST ENGLAND.   THE FARMERS     
 EITHER GROW CEREAL CROPS OR VEGATABLES
 IN SOME SORT OF ROTATION.   THE REASON
 FOR THIS IS THAT THE CLIMATE AND SOIL 
 IS SUITABLE FOR CEREAL CROPS AND THERE
 IS A LARGE RESIDENTIAL AREA NEARBY SO 
 THERE IS A SUITABLE MARKET FOR THE    
 VEGETABLE PRODUCE.   THERE USED TO BE 
 A LOT OF SHEEP FARMING AND DAIRY      
 FARMING BUT BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT     
 POLICIES AND THE COMMON MARKET IT IS  
 MORE PROFITABLE FOR FARMERS TO GROW   
 CEREAL CROPS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.      
 THEREFORE A LOT OF GRAZING LAND HAS   
 RECENTLY BEEN PLOUGHED UP.   THERE IS 
 ALSO A LOT OF PLOUGHING UP OF THE     
 HEDGEROWS TAKING PLACE TO MAKE LARGER 
 FIELDS AND ALSO A LOT OF ARTIFICIAL   
 FERTILISERS USED WHICH IS AFFECTING   
 THE WILDLIFE IN THIS AREA.            </content>
