		<title>18RELIGION - NAPTON</title>
		<content> There was an old legend about the     
 church first being built on the       
 village green. When the bricks were   
 taken ready for building they were    
 taken to the top of Butt Hill. People 
 said that is where God wanted it to be
 built. When a baby was christened,    
 people used to believe that the vicar 
 was sending away the devil. There is a
 door by the font with a grille. This  
 may have been put there so the devil  
 could fly away. It is called the      
 devil's door. There were a lot of     
 graves in the churchyard. Some of the 
 old graves were crumbling away and you
 could not read the dates. Most of the 
 old graves were made in the 1600's,   
 that is nearly 400 years ago.Sometimes
 people used to steal bodies out of    
 graves to sell to doctors to do       
 experiments on them, so they put      
 railings round the graves.            </content>
