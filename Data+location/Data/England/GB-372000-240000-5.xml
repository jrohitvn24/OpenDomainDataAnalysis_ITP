		<content> Brockbury Hall, now a prosperous dairy
 farm, was once owned by Humphrey      
 Walwyn. He became a member of the     
 Worshipful Company of Grocers, and in 
 his will of 1612 he entrusted the     
 Company to carry out a generous       
 bequest. This involved the building   
 in 1622 of a Free School in Colwall;  
 later split into The Elms - a fee     
 paying Prep School - and a public     
 Elementary School. The Elms, still in 
 existence, is the oldest Prep School  
 in the country. Inside the school,    
 remains of the 17th century school are
 still to be seen, as well as a number 
 of cannonballs fired in the Civil War.
 Today the charitable aims of Humphrey 
 are continued by The Walwyn           
 Foundation, which funds students and  
 apprentices with books and tools. It  
 has also funded the library. The old  
 Elementary School was sold recently.  </content>
