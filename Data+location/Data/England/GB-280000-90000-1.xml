		<title>01North of Dunsford, Devon</title>
		<content> The 4x3km area lying between Dunsford 
 and Tedburn St Mary is predominately a
 farming one.  Four narrow tarmaced    
 lanes bisect the block.  These are    
 typical of Devon's winding lanes with 
 high hedgerows creating a sunken lane 
 effect.  To the eastern side is part  
 of the parish of Holcombe Burnell and 
 there are two brooks or streams,      
 tributaries of the River Teign which  
 flow south.  A small part of the area 
 is within the bounds of the Dartmoor  
 National Park.  Numerous small woods  
 and coppices abound within the whole  
 area.  As is general now with these   
 types of farms mostly on hilly ground 
 in Devon the main agriculture is dairy
 and sheep production.
