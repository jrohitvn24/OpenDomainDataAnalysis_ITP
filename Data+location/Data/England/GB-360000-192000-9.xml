		<content>{MARBLES.}We play marbles in school.   
 There are several sizes of marbles.   
 First we tap marbles, you tap a       
 different amount of times according to
 the size of the marbles.  This means  
 the game is for keeps.  Then you roll 
 your marble on the ground and your    
 opponent tries to hit it. You can do  
 different things with your marble like
 a rolling throw or bombing.  When you 
 hit your opponents marble you win it. 
{CONKERS.}We play conkers in the autumn
 because the conkers fall then.  If you
 bake them they go hard, so it is      
 easier to smash the opponents conker. 
 You push a hole through the conker and
 thread some string through the conker.
 You hold the conker up in the air and 
 above your waist. The other person    
 tries to hit it.  You take turns      
 alternatively until the conker breaks.
