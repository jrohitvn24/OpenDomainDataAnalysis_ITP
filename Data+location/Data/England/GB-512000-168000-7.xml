		<title>07EAST MOLESEY</title>
		<content>  {East Molesey}is a small town just   
{south of the River Thames by Hampton  
{Court Bridge.} Although the           
 residential part of East Molesey      
 stretches far the shopping area       
 remains in the tight nucleus of the   
 original village.{ Many of the local  
{residents still view East Molesey as a
{village}and unlike other nearby areas 
 it certainly does have the "feel" of a
 close-knit community.                 
   Being so{close to the busy tourist  
{attraction of Hampton Court}has       
 visibly affected E.Molesey.  Although 
 there are about 30 shop units in the  
 immediate area{only one}of these is a 
{general food store.} There are{several
{art galleries and antique shops}the   
 proprietors of which readily          
 acknowledge the value of a site so    
 close to a large source of overseas   
 visitors.                             </content>
