		<content> Most people in Pinvin shop weekly at  
 Gateway in Pershore, about a mile     
 away. The least popular supermarket in
 the area seems to be the Pershore     
 Co-op.                                
    Apart from the small, and          
 therefore expensive,{village stores}in
 Peopleton and Pinvin there are no     
 other places to shop for food. It is  
 therefore essential to have a car as  
 bus services are either very          
 infrequent or non-existent. Old people
 have to either take a taxi into       
 Pershore, a train into Worcester or   
 put up with the limited range and high
 prices of the village store.          
    Some people prefer to shop monthly 
 and usually go to one of the big      
{supermarkets}in Worcester with lots of
 variety, and lower prices.
