 breakfast and do the children's school
 lunches.My husband usually takes the  
 children to the bus stop,but if he has
 to leave early for work I take them.I 
 then sit down and have my own         
 breakfast and read the newspaper.After
 which I'll wash up the breakfast      
 dishes and tidy up.Then I finish any  
 washing left over.When that is done I 
 start getting ready for work.At 11:30 
 I start my job in the local pub.I     
 finish about 3:30pm.I then wait at the
 bus stop for my youngest child.If it's
 raining I go to pick my eldest up     
 from the bus stop.I then go home,sit  
 down for a quarter of an hour and have
 a cup of coffee.I then prepare the tea

 then sit and watch{I.T.V.}I go to bed 
 round about midnight.                 </content>
