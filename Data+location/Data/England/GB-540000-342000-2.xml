		<title>02SEA BANK</title>
		<content> The bank has to be high enough to keep
 out the tide which can be as high as  
 8.5 meters. Sometimes when the        
 bank is being built it is not high    
 enough to stop the tide getting       
 through and this bank is lost and work
 must start again. The bank they are   
 working on now should be high enough  
 to prevent any flooding behind it.This
 bank is over 1 mile long.             
      In the first year after the sea  
 wall is completed the rain washes the 
 salt from the top inch of the soil and
 the salt level is reduced by          
 approximatly 1"each year. In 7 years  
 the soil is salt free.                
      After all the creeks have been   
 filled in the reclaimed land is grazed
 by sheep and cattle which helps to    
 fertilize it:It is then ploughed and  
 cultivated and put down to crops such 
 as potatoes ,wheat or corn.           </content>
