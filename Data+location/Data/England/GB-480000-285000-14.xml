   Stoke Wood covers 26 acres and is at
least 400 years old. It is part of the 
ancient Rockingham Forest and it is    
managed as a coppiced woodland. It was 
coppiced in medieval times. The stakes 
are used for fencing and the hazel     
binders are used in hedge laying. Clear
felling is carried on. Oak trees are   
cut down when they are 40 to 150 years 
old. Ash, Silver Birch and Field Maple 
are cut down when they are 25 to 40    
years old. There is a lot of grass in  
the wood which is evidence that in the 
past it was used for common grazing.   
The wood has an Oak, Ash, Silver Birch 
and Field Maple canopy with Hazel      
shrubs underneath. On the ground there 
are a lot of rare plants and so open   
rides have to be cut to let light in.
