		<content>  Stetchworth is mainly residential now
 although there used to be quite a lot 
 of industry connected with farming and
 horse breeding. All that is left apart
 from farms and studs is the woodyard  
 at the top of Teakettle Lane.This used
 to supply all the wood used for farm  
 buildings but nowadays it only sells  
 firewood to local residents.          
  In February 1985, a farrier  set     
 up business in the closed down Co-op  
 shop in the High Street.He serves the 
 local studs.                          
  Over half the parents of children at 
 Stetchworth School travel outside the 
 area to work. The rest either work at 
 home or are unemployed.We think that, 
 apart from the old aged pensioners,   
 this is true of most of the people who
 live in the area.
