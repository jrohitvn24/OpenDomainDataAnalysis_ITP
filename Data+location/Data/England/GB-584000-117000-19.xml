		<title>19HOUSING</title>
		<content> Housing consists primarily of older   
 houses like cottages and farmhouses   
 dating back about 300 years.  Due to  
 planning restrictions few new houses  
 have been built in recent             
 years.Several derelict oast_houses    
 have lately been converted into modern
 dwelling.  Due to the spreading nature
 of the village, many houses are rather
 isolated.  Most cottages and houses   
 are privately owned, although some    
 rents are paid.  .the exception is    
 Lower Cross Cottages, which is a small
 estate of l2 houses owned by Rother   
 District Council.  These can now be   
 purchased by the tenants if desired. A
 few houses are still 'tied cottages', 
 let to farm_workers for as long as    
 they work on the connected farm.  No  
 new housing development is planned or 
 likely. See Rape of Hastings Archi_   
 tectural Survey about old houses.     </content>
