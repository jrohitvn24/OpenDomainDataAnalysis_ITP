		<title>02AN ORDINARY DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> At the beginning of a day I get up and
 open my curtains and go downstairs. I 
 read the paper and then have my       
 breakfast of cornflakes milk and      
 sugar. Then I feed my cat and fish.   
 Then I get dressed and put my shoes   
 on, clean my teeth and comb my hair.  
 Then I look at the post. Usually I go 
 for my friend and play on his Spectrum
 computer or play on his skateboard or 
 I do some gardening in my garden. At  
 about 12.30 if I am at my friend's I  
 come home and have my dinner of       
 sometimes spaghetti or pizza. Then I  
 have a drink and play out again.      
 Sometimes I play snooker where you    
 knock balls into a pocket. On a green 
 table with pockets. Then I have my tea
 and play games until 9.00 - bedtime.  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
