		<content>      La Rocque grower Mr Claud Bertram
 says, "My main crop is potatoes now   
 that I have given up growing          
 tomatoes."  The light soil of this    
 low-lying area suited the growing of  
 outdoor tomatoes for export to the    
 mainland, a trade which flourished for
 nearly a century.  But Britain's entry
 into the Common Market brought        
 continental competition and forced    
 growers in the area into a mixed      
 'market-garden' type of horticulture. 
 Mr Bertram has some large glasshouses.
  "In them I grow spray carnations and 
 iris for export," he says.  He also   
 grows specialist crops such as        
 calabrese and asparagus.  Mr Bertram  
 sells his asparagus to local          
 restaurants.  He keeps no cows but a  
 few farmers in La Rocque do have small
 herds of Jerseys to supplement their  
 incomes as growers.                   </content>
