		<content> A totally rural area. No industry or  
 employment apart from agriculture.    
 Tunstall is contracting: loss of      
 church, shop, school.                 
 Halvergate is expanding slowly and has
 maintained its services. Expansion is 
 due to commuterisation.               
 Both villages are marsh edge          
 settlements, with distinctive line    
 between marsh and upland. Wooded area 
 in N.W. of region consist of Willow   
 and Alder carrs. Marshland is treeless
 and hedgeless. Grazing marshland is   
 divided up by drainage dykes          
 controlled by engine driven pumps. The
 western half is mainly arable         
 and consists of wheat and sugar beat  
 crops. Eastern half is totally        
 marshland grazing for cattle          
 and sheep with small areas being      
 cultivated after drainage.
