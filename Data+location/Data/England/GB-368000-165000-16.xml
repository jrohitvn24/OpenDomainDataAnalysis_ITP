		<title>16WORK SALTFORD WEST OF BATH</title>
		<content> Saltford was once a farming community 
 with small industries.Allfarming land 
 is now worked by contract farmers,no  
 farmers live in the area any          
 more.Very few parents work in the     
 village.{Fathers where they work}     
 Bristol 60% Bath 5% Local 10%         
 Travel 15%{Fathers type of work       
 Manual 20% Office 65% Travel 15%      
{Mothers who work} Full time 10%       
 Part time 55% Housewife 15%           
 Many children don't see their fathers 
 before 7 o'clock each evening.Many    
 families live on an above average     
 income and the cost of housing in the 
 area is high.The future prospects on  
 local employment is unlikely to       
 change.A strong "green-belt"policy    
 will keep Saltford about its present  
 size for the next decade until housing
 needs change.
