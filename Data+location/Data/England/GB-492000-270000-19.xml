		<title>19The Pantomime Cinderella'</title>
		<content>   I took part in the pantomime last   
year. I was in the childrens chorus.   
It all started in September when I     
went for an audition. I had to sing a  
song on the stage in front of several  
people. Then I had to go off stage and 
wait while other people did their      
auditions. I passed the audition and   
then I had to start going to weekly    
rehearsals. The rehearsals at the      
beginning are just once a week, as the 
actual performance gets closer they    
are three times a week for the children
and every night for the adults. The    
pantomime is performed for 6 nights    
and one matinee. One of the last       
performances is videoed and later in   
the year, about March, all the cast    
have a fish and chip supper and watch  
the video. It is all great fun.
