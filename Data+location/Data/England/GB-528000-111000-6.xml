		<content> The Rector is a busy man. Besides     
 taking services at 4 separate churches
 he spends much time visiting local    
 villagers. He also writes hymns and   
 publishes books including the story of
 a monk in cartoons.                   
 There is a ladies social committee    
 which raises money for the church.    
 Sales are held which can raise up to  
 Â£4OO. Fairs are held outside the      
 village because there is not a hall   
 big enough at Pyecombe. There are no  
 activities for young people except a  
 Sunday School run by the lady living  
 in the cottage opposite the church but
 only 2 or 3 children go to this. A    
 group of 18 ladies take turns to share
 the flower arranging each month.      
 Special meetings are held at Christmas
 to make arrangements for the festival.
 Other social events include occasional
 music concerts and local barn dances. </content>
