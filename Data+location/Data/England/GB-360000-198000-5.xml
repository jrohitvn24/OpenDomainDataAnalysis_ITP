		<title>05A QUIET LIFE...</title>
		<content> Home life and living in a rural area  
 such as Alvington is very relaxed and 
 easy going.  Life is very simple.  The
 dialect is west country.  Most        
 households have pets, mainly cats and 
 dogs, some chickens, a few goats and  
 the odd pony.  In this area all houses
 have gardens which are large enough to
 grow their own produce.  Fresh        
 vegetables help greatly with the      
 family budget.  Households fortunate  
 enough to have a home freezer freeze  
 excess fruit and vegetables.          
 The total population of Alvington in  
 1984 was 612.  This consists of 498   
 adults and 114 children under the age 
 of 16.                                
 Because of government policy of       
 centralisation and economy the one and
 only school in Alvington has been     
 closed and converted into two houses.
