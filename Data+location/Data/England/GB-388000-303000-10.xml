The contract states that the land on   
which the factory is sited costs one   
pound  per acre for ninety nine        
years.Dowty do not use the Shropshire  
Union canal anymore,it is actually an  
inconvenience.In a school survey we    
found that only three children have    
parents working at Dowty Boulton       
Paul.Dowty do not have many competitors
but those they do have are very        
large.During the war Dowty Boulton Paul
bred their own pigs,to be used for food
in the canteen.They also built parts   
for the Defiant.Recently Dowty's have  
had three separate redundances.        
Everything is made by machine in the   
factory.Dowty Boulton Paul is important
to the community because of the        
employment it offers to the residents  
of Bilbrook.
