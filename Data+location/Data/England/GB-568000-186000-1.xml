		<content> Basildon New Town was conceived as an 
 over-spill development for London. The
 town was started about 25 years ago.  
 The houses and factories were to be   
 kept apart, and if you worked in      
 Basildon, the you lived in Basildon.  
 Therefore there was no railway station
 in the beginning. Today, many people  
 work in London and live in Basildon,  
 and many of the people that work in   
 the factories do not live in Basildon.
                                       
 Surrounding Basildon is much open     
 space, but the town is expanding all  
 the time. The old villages of Vange,  
 Pitsea,and Laindon have been swallowed
 up by the expansion of the New Town.
