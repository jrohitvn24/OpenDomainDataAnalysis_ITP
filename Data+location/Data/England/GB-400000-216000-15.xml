		<title>15Gloucester Flying Machine</title>
		<content>     Of all the coaches the Gloucester 
 Flying machine was the most famous. It
 was the first coach to be fitted with 
 steel springs on the London-Gloucester
 road. The journey took two days. The  
 Gloucester Flying machine made its    
 first run in April 1756, leaving the  
 yard of the Kings Head in Westgate    
 Street, Gloucester at three o'clock in
 the morning and picking up passengers 
 at the coach office in Northgate      
 Street whuch was opened by John Turner
 in November 1755. The first stop was  
 the Frogmill. There passengers from   
 Cheltenham joined the coach and after 
 a change of horses the journey was    
 continued through Burford and Witney  
 to Oxford. At the New Inn in St.      
 Aldates, Oxford, the flying machine   
 was laid up for the night. At five    
 o'clock the next morning the coach    
 left Oxford by Magdalen Bridge.       </content>
