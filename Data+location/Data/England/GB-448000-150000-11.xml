		<content>{The Newcomer to the Village}          
 I moved to Overton in August 1984 from
 Birmingham. This pattern of movement  
 is unusual since house prices are 30% 
 higher here. We moved because of my   
 husband's job which is teaching. In   
 theory employment is plentiful here   
 but I have had some difficulty        
 finding a teaching post for myself. We
 selected Overton because it possessed 
 a Primary  School, was close to a     
 large centre (Basingstoke) but did    
 have some shops of its own and was    
 reputed to be friendly with plenty    
 happening. Best described as a        
 working class village, it is dominated
 by Portal's Mill. We have not found it
 to be as friendly as reputed and we   
 have found a greater awareness of     
 social class differences here than in 
 our previous community.
