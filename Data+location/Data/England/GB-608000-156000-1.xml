		<title>01 Chaucer's England.</title>
		<content>The ancient Pilgrims Way track         
meanders through Chartham Hatch towards
Canterbury.If Chaucer were to retrace  
his journey today,much would have      
changed,but he would still recognise   
something of its essential             
spirit.Strange would be the cars,the   
televisions,telephones and suchlike,but
the woodcutters cutting the coppice    
nearby,and the farm workers,the hearts 
of these folk would be the same as the 
hearts of Chaucer's characters.Men and 
women whose lives are merged with the  
nature and the place of their          
work.Today,farming and carefully       
managed woodland dominate the          
area.Orchards abound.A major road,the  
new A2,scars the countryside along the 
route of the old Roman Road to         
London,but the rest of the few roads   
are narrow country roads.It is ideal   
countryside for the rambler.           </content>
