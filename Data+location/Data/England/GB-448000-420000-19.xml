		<title>19J.A.M.CLUB</title>
		<content> Every Thursday we go to J.A.M. club.  
 One of our teachers at school,Mr.     
 Taylor,helps to run the club. J.A.M.  
 stands for"Jesus and me".             
 When we arrive we get our membership  
 card which has our name,address and   
 telephone number on so that we can be 
 contacted if for any reason the       
 meeting for that week has to be       
 cancelled.                            
 We learn about Jesus and the Disciples
 from the Bible and how he affects our 
 life today.We sing songs,pray,play    
 games and have stories about Jesus.We 
 also have a quiz and can earn points  
 for correct answers.At the end of term
 we can change our points for prizes   
 and stickers.We have a prayer drill   
 which Mr.Taylor does with us.         
 We have been going to J.A.M. club for 
 a few years now and we really enjoy   
 it.                                   </content>
