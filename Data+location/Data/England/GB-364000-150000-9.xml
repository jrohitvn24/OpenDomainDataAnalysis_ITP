		<title>09Old Red House Farm (cont)</title>
		<content> At Red House Farm,{silage}is made in  
 two ways.Firstly,{contractors}come to 
 the Farm with an enormous machine and 
 make{grass "clamps"}which are put in  
 between the Farm walls.The rest is    
 made into big round bales and stored  
 in large plastic bags.To do this work 
 our own{baler}is used.It is also used 
 to help other farmers in the area to  
 bale their silage or straw.On the Farm
 we also keep about five or six young  
 calves,which we buy and suckle on four
 nurse cows.These are then sold again  
 when they are bigger.There are twelve 
{hens}in the yard which are kept for   
 eggs. There are usually enough for the
 family and for friends. Two people run
 the farm,working as partners. The     
 farmhouse buildings are estimated to  
 be some{250 years old}and the Farm    
 itself was part of the{Ammerdown      
{Estate}until 1905.                    </content>
