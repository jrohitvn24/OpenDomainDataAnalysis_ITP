		<title>07Housing in Harold Hill</title>
		<content> The majority of the houses we found   
 were terraced;they contained two or   
 three bedrooms,a bathroom,a kitchen   
 and one living-room.They were built in
 the early 70's:Most of these houses   
 are owned by the G.L.C.,but some of   
 them are privately owned.On first     
 appearance the houses looked pleasant 
 and well built.However during our     
 survey we discovered that these houses
 have serious problems with damp.The   
 G.L.C. were improvin them with thermal
 cladding insulation,they were also    
 replacing the old windows with double 
  glazing.                             
 We also discovered an old folks       
 residential hall/flats.They were built
 in 1983 on the grounds of a school    
 which was closed fue to falling       
 rolls.They are self contained one     
 bedroom flats with a warden and a     
 general common room.                  </content>
