My activities during the day are as    
follows...my alarm clock goes off at   
7.00. I turn it off and go back to     
sleep. At 7.30 mu Mum brings me a cup  
of tea to wake me up. I then go        
downstairs and eat my breakfast. When I
have eaten I get my schhol clothes     
ready and go and wash. Soon my friends 
call for me and together we go to      
school. We leave our  house at about   
8.30. Firstly I take my younger Sister 
to the First School. Then my friends   
and I take their sisters to the other  
First School. After this we head       
towards or school-The Middle School.   
After a day at school I play with a few
of my friends. At 20.00 I would have   
my tea after which I would play till   
21.00. After a cup of coffee I would   
wash and go to bed. That is what       
happens nearly every school day.       </content>
