		<title>09Scotton/Northorpe: Transport</title>
		<content> The majority of families own a car    
 (a lot are 2-car families), as there  
 is very little public transport left. 
 Scotton is on the Gainsborough-       
 Scunthorpe bus route, with 6 buses in 
 each direction on weekdays; there is  
 no Sunday service. The timing of the  
 buses is not always convenient (no bus
 from Gainsborough between 10.35 am and
 4.10 pm, last through bus leaves      
 Gainsborough at 6.45 pm, Scunthorpe   
 5.40 pm). There is no public transport
 to or from Northorpe, the County      
 Council provide school buses for      
 children going to Scotter, Gains-     
 borough and Kirton Lindsey. Northorpe 
 was on the main railway route from    
 Grimsby to Manchester, with Northorpe 
 station (now closed) particularly busy
 for goods.  A victim of the Beeching  
 cuts in the mid 1950s the line is now 
 reduced to a single track (goods only)</content>
