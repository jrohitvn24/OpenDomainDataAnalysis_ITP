		<title>16CONTROVERSY - SULLINGTON</title>
		<content> The main cause of controversy in      
 Sullington in the past few years has  
 been the intensive calf rearing       
 carried on at Gerston Farm, which is  
 owned by the Norbertine Canons.  There
 has been a number of demonstrations by
 the Animal Rights Campaigners,        
 culminating in a court action where   
 the farm manager was acquitted of the 
 charge of cruelty to animals.  It has 
 now been announced that the farm is   
 for sale as it has become an          
 uneconomic proposition.
