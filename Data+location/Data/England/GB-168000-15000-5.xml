		<title>05St.Ruan</title>
		<content> The name Ruan comes from St.Rumon.His 
 name is associated with Ruan          
 Minor and Ruan Major which are in the 
 area and Ruan Lanihorne which is on   
 the River Fal.He was an Irishman and  
 in the sixth century set up the       
 monastery bishopric Treguier in       
 Brittany.Before this in the fifth     
 century he left Ireland and came into 
 Cornwall to begin his work in the     
 rough area of the Lizard peninsula.   
 Near Ruan Minor there is a little     
 valley which is called St.Ruan        
 and a cottage there named St.Rumon.It 
 seems as though St.Rumon lived        
 somewhere around here.St.Ruan is quite
 different from the rest of the area   
 because it is peaceful and sheltered  
 and has lots of trees.
