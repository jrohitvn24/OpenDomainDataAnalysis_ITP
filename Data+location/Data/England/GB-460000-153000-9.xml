		<content> The area is farmed from eight farms,  
 seven of which have their main        
 buildings within the grid.  The area  
 once supported many more smaller      
 farms, the names of which remain as   
 house names or names of areas. West   
 Lane Farm, Wellfield Farm and         
 Greatfield Farm are owned by the      
 Basingstoke and Deane District Council
 and are farmed by tenant farmers.     
 Manor Farm is part of a major         
 consortium, the rest are independants.
 The farming is a mixture of arable and
 dairy husbandry. There are fields for 
 grazing and fields of sown grass for  
 silage and hay.  The dairy herds are  
 generally Fresian. The farms grow     
 winter and spring barley for malting  
 and cattle food.  Wheat is grown for  
 bread, biscuits and cattle food.      
 There are also vegetable crops such as
 peas and broad beans grown.           </content>
