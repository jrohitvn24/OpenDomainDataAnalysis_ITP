		<content> An area of Northamptonshire Uplands,  
 with pleasant rolling countryside,    
 large farms and small villages. The   
 area is disected by the A361 road,    
 recently upgraded to form a through   
 route between the Midlands and the    
 south west. Scars still show where the
 former Great Central Railway passed   
 through this area and Catesby Tunnel  
 is a prominant landmark. The only     
 village in this area is Charwetton.   
 Nearby the RiverCharwell begins its   
 long journey to eventually join the   
 Thames. The village has declined in   
 importance over the years although    
 recently a small estate of executive  
 homes has been built. Nearby lies     
 Church Charwetton with its deserted   
 village. Surrounding the settlement is
 land used for sheep grazing, although 
 increasingly pasture is being ploughed
 for wheat, barley and oilseed rape.   </content>
