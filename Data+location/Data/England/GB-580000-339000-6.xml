		<content>    Seen from the top of Beacon Hill   
 (184 feet above sea level) our        
 landscape is primarily one of rural   
 agriculture with the sea in the       
 background. The fields of crops       
 are large, with hedges and ditches    
 marking their boundaries. The north-  
 eastern sector of this area contains  
 many houses and much new building     
 work. The cottages at the foot of     
 Beacon Hill Road are good examples of 
 local domestic architecture of the    
 last century: traditional local       
 buildings such as these have walls of 
 flint and very steep roofs covered    
 with Norfolk pantiles. Bricks came    
 from the brickworks at Peterstone     
 Farm, Holkham. Modern builders are    
 encouraged to use these traditional   
 materials wherever possible and some  
 of the new buildings blend in very    
 successfully with the old.            </content>
