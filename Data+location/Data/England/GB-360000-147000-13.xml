		<content> Entertainment in the two villages is  
 created by the villagers. In Binegar  
 and Gurney Slade a lot of             
 entertainment centres around the two  
 public houses and The George, in      
 particular, has its own skittles and  
 darts team and will raise a team for  
 most sports if the challenge is there.
 Clubs in the village include Brownies 
 and Cubs for young people, the Womens 
 Institute and a Welcome Club for the  
 elderly. In Oakhill there is a cricket
 and football team, Cubs, Guides and   
 Brownies. The Royal British Legion has
 both men and womens branches and there
 is a Good Companions Club for the     
 elderly. There is also a youth club,  
 an Oakhill branch of the Womens       
 Institute, an Oakhill band and a well 
 respected Choral Society. There is a  
 parish council for both Ashwick and   
 Binegar.                              </content>
