		<content> Another disaster has happened in      
 Bacup. A local factory has been burnt 
 to ashes. Its name is Cee Jays a shoe 
 factory on Albert Street. About       
 one hundred people are now out        
 of work for ten weeks or more until   
 new premises can be found. They       
 are getting paid a percentage of their
 usual wage.                           
                                       
 A certain well known sportsman has    
 given Bacup a good name. That person  
 is Brian Roche. He has won yet another
 victory in boxing after recently      
 becoming a professional. This time he 
 was fighting Lez Walsh who was a      
 champion of his amateur class of      
 boxing.
