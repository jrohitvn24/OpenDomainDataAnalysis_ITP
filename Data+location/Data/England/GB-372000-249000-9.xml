{      A VICTORIAN COUNTRY HOUSE       
                                       
      Birchwood Hall is a large,       
 imposing edifice occupying a site with
 splendid views of the north and west. 
 It was built for the Mayor of         
 Worcester in 1850 and has 27 rooms. It
 now houses a commune of eleven adults 
 and four children in the main house   
 and in the converted outbuildings.    
 The occupants are professional people 
 who have chosen to live in this style 
 because of their wish to lead a       
 co-operative life in a country        
 setting.  Each family has private     
 accommodation, with shared rooms for  
 leisure activities.  There is a rota  
 system for housework and cooking in   
 which all share.
