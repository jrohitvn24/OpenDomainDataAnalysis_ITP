		<content>{Longwood Farm }has been worked by Mr.D
  Stevenson for the last 10 years.He   
 does not use chemical pesticides or   
 fertilisers and grazes sheep and fat  
 cattle on the steep upland pastures.  
   The 195 acre farm has 125 acres of  
 grassland and the rest is woodland,   
 some so ancient that it has been there
 since the last Ice Age.               
   The soil in the area is always      
 creeping down the sides of Nottingham 
 Hill and it has caused the demolition 
 of at least 4 houses in the recent    
 past.                                 
   Mr. Stevenson is very interested in 
 nature conservancy and has planted    
 various types of native trees in spare
 sections of his land.In the Summer he 
 has to seek and destroy the poisonous 
 ragwort which may be growing in his   
 fields.
