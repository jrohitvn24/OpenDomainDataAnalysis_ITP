		<title>04LACROSSE IN STOCKPORT AREA</title>
		<content>   Lacrosse is a strenuous game for 11 
 players which originates from the     
 Iroquois tribe of Indians in          
 N.America. A small ball is passed     
 between players using a special stick 
 with a net or "crosse" on the end in  
 which to carry the ball,until a goal  
 is scored. Protective equipment is    
 required. A helmet and gloves are     
 compulsory but players also wear arm  
 and shoulder pads. The game has been  
 played in Stockport (the major        
 Lacrosse area in the North of England)
 since before 1940, but today only     
 about 1000 men play in N.England and  
 most top level players are over 30    
 years old. The game is in danger of   
 dying out although there are 11 mens  
 teams throughout Stockport and        
 Cheadle. There is also a game called  
 Womens' Lacrosse in which there are   
 more rules but no equipment.          </content>
