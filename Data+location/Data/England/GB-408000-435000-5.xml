		<title>05THE AIRE VALLEY TRUNK ROAD</title>
		<content>  Over the last few years the A650 from
{Bradford}to{Keighley}has been crowded 
 by cars. Due to the congestion and the
 many accidents, people living between{
{Bradford}and{Keighley,}like those in  
{Cottingley }and {Bingley,}have been   
 told a new Trunk Road may be built. We
 interviewed two people to find out    
 their views on the Trunk Road.        
  We interviewed the owner of a garage 
 in Cottingley. He said, "The business 
 will not prosper, but it will not be  
 any worse." He also said, "I think it 
 will go ahead."                       
  Then we interviewed someone whose    
 house is in direct line of the        
 expected route. He thinks it will not 
 ease any problems because the proposed
 Trunk Road will stop before the{      
{SALTAIRE ROUNDABOUT,}which leads to   
 one of the main roads going into      
 BRADFORD.                             </content>
