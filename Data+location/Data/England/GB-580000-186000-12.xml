		<title>12Brief Historical Outline.</title>
		<content>  There have been settlements in the   
 area since before history was written.
 Excavations at Hadleigh, south of the 
 Church found evidence of human        
 habitation during the Iron Age. The   
 name Hadleigh is of Saxon derivation  
 meaning:"the clearing near the heath".
 Today much of the original woodland   
 and farmland has given way to housing 
 and the areas are known as{Hadleigh,  
{Leigh-on-Sea}or{Eastwood.}Only street 
 and pub. names remind us of historicl 
 associations: Daws Heath named after  
 Philip Dawe or "The Waggon and Horses"
 or Softwater Lane. The area names may 
 be dropped as people become accustomed
 to using the{post-codes}devised by the
 Post Office to simplify the sorting of
 mail.e.g.Hadleigh Jun.Sch.is{SS7 2DQ.}
  The A13 follows the routes that have 
 been tramped since early times.Today  
 it is a very busy road.               </content>
