		<title>01 The Village of St. Cleer.</title>
		<content>    St. Cleer is a village of about    
 3,000 inhabitants in East Cornwall,   
 three miles north of Liskeard. It is  
 on the edge of Bodmin Moor, 700 feet  
 above sea level.                      
    In the centre of the village the   
 houses are old, because it is in the  
 middle of an old tin and copper mining
 area, but there are many new estates  
 with people who commute to Liskeard or
 Plymouth,  which is 17 miles away.    
    The church stands at the highest   
 part of the village. There are three  
 shops, a post office, two inns, a     
 garage and a new school.              
    To the east of St. Cleer is the    
 village of Tremar, divided into Higher
 Tremar, Tremarcoombe and Lower Tremar.
 Tremar has a chapel and a village     
 shop.                                 
    The rest of our area is mainly farm
 land, with scattered groups of houses.</content>
