		<title>14On Saturdays (2) by Alan</title>
		<content> We play football all over the County. 
 My team has been in the finals twice. 
 We won once and lost once.            
 When I arrive back at home I have a   
 bath and then have my tea. I watch the
 football results on the television and
 then go out to play football again. We
 have a good game of football or rugby 
 and sometimes hide and seek.          
 If it is hot we go up to the beck     
 (stream) and paddle.                  
 When I come in I have a cool drink and
 sometimes an ice-pop out of the       
 refrigerator.  I settle down to watch 
 "Match of the Day" on the television. 
 Then I get washed and go to bed.      
 That's what I do on a Saturday.
