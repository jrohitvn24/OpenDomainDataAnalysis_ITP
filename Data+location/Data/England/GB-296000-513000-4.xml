		<title>04HIGH LOW FARM</title>
		<content> High Low Farm is typical of the farms 
 in the area.Currently the farmer has  
 75 Fresian milk cows,12 cows in       
 calf,14 Heifer calves,60 stirks and 1 
 Hereford bull.Also on the farm are    
 70 sheep,35 having lambed this        
 year,and 3 sheepdogs.To complete the  
 farm there were 12 hens,12 guinea fowl
 and three ducks.The farm is mainly    
 concerned with milk production and the
 land round about is given over to     
 pasture,hay making or silage with only
 narrow strips given over to barley and
 oat production.The farm itself has 5  
 byres and numerous sheds and barns    
 with a large farmhouse that has had a 
 modern kitchen built on.The yard is   
 cobbled.Near the farm on our map was  
 meadow cottage,but we could only find 
 a path and pieces of stone to show    
 where it had stood.
