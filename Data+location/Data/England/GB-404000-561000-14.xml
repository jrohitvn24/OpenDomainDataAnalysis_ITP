		<title>14THE POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> My Mum is the postmistress of a small 
 village post office near Mickley.     
 We have got to know many people. They 
 come to pay their telephone bills,TV  
 license, buy stamps and postal orders 
 and collect their Family Allowance    
 money and pensions. My Mum helps when 
 they want to know about special forms.
 The mail is collected twice a day.    
 We sell sweets, crisps and pop.

 I have come to live in Mickley from   
 South Africa where my Daddy was a post
 office superintendent. His post office
 was very different from the one in    
 Mickley. There were guards at the     
 entrance and he had a special code    
 number to get into his office. He     
 hopes to be a postmaster in England.
