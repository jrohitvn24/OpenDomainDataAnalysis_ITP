		<title>14ROADS IN WITHYHAM/ST.JOHN</title>
		<content> There are two{roads}starting from Lye 
 Green; one goes in a southerly        
 direction then goes southwest. The    
 first road goes to St. John's. The old
{Roman}road goes very near the         
 s-westerly road. Names like Faggot    
 Stack Corner indicate that the wooded 
 areas were known for iron smelting in 
 the past. The shape of the road often 
 follows early farm{tracks,}being      
 metalled and turned into tarmac. ome  
 straightening out due to modern raod  
 traffic is to be found but not much.  
 Road traffic signs, cats eyes in the  
 cenrre of the road and painted white  
 lines help to keep traffic moving     
 safely.
