		<content>    This block is divided into two     
areas.One of these areas is mainly farm
land where the population is not very  
high.The other area has a growing      
population.The evidence of this is the 
new estates appearing around Manchester
Road.The kind of people who live on    
these estates are Y.M.C.(young married 
couples).Not many old people live on   
these estates.The houses are to big and
have stairs which old people can't     
manage.But now smaller houses and      
bungalows are being built for the older
generation and people who cannot manage
stairs or live alone.                  
     Over to the west of Manchester    
Road there are many old terranced      
houses,semi detatched houses,and a     
couple of ageing estates.Near the      
copice there are also two new estates  
being built.The new estates house about
four people per house comfortably.     </content>
