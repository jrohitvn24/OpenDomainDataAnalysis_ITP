		<content>   Tibbs Court Farm has 116 acres of   
{orchards}(110 of apples,6 of pears)and
 80 acres of{hops.}It employs 10 full  
 time men, 12 full time local "casual" 
 women and students for apple packing &amp;
 about 50 extra people for hop-picking.
   The orchards are tended throughout  
 the year.During the winter trees are  
 pruned and sprayed to kill wintering  
 parasites.In the spring further sprays
 are used including one to prevent too 
 many apples from setting so that the  
 fruit produced will be a good size.   
   Fruit picking begins in July and    
 continues into November according to  
 the variety.Apples and pears are      
 handled carefully to avoid bruising,  
 they are picked into specially        
 designed bags or bins and then emptied
 into large bulk containers to be taken
 by tractor or fork-lift truck to the  
 packhouse or cold store.              </content>
