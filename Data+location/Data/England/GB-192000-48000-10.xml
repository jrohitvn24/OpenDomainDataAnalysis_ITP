		<title>10Grampound Playgroup</title>
		<content>  The playgroup is run in the village  
 hall and it is for children under 4   
 and a half.There are about 15 children
 who go to it at the moment.It starts  
 at 9.30 and finishes at 12.00.When the
 children arrive they play games and   
 play with toys like tractors and      
 plastic trailers.After that they make 
 pictures and models.The mums cut the  
 things out and the children stick them
 on.If the children do paintings they  
 do it all themselves.After they have  
 finished that they go out into the    
 recreation field to play with balls   
 and running around catching each      
 other.While the children  and some    
 adults are in the recreation field    
 some other mums clean up all the      
 paints and all the mess the children  
 have made.When the children come in   
 again they sit down on the floor and  
 have some milk and then go home.      </content>
