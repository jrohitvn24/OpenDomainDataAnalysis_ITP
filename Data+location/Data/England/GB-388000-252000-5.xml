 the{Spetchley Estate.}The             
 immediate estate of Spetchley Park

 wrought iron gates can be made. 2 men

 in the area, although recently a

 Bredicot village with the support of  
 local people. The fruit farms of      
 Sneachill also offer opportunities for

 employment opportunites for the young 
 are fewer owing to mechanisation.     </content>
