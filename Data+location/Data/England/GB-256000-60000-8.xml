		<content> Where china clay has been extracted,  
 there have been two new forms of      
 landscape produced.One type is the    
 creation of large holes over a hundred
 metres deep.The other type is produced
 from what comes out of these large    
 holes-waste.The material which makes  
 up these waste tips is mainly sand.   
 These large waste tips are arranged in
 layers of about twenty-five metres,   
 producing a terraced effect.The most  
 prominent of the tips is the Cholwich 
 Town tip,which is situated below Penn 
 Beacon.This tip is to be extended     
 eastwards but not to cover Cholwich   
 Town farmhouse,which is of historical 
 interest.At present parts of the tips 
 are being sprayed with a mixture of   
 fertilizer,seed and cellulose in an   
 attempt to establish vegetation.In    
 time it is hoped that trees will be   
 planted on the lower slopes.          </content>
