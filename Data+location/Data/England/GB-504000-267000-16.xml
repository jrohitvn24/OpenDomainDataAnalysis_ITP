		<title>16Information in Dean</title>
		<content> The main source of information is the 
 "Honeycombe".This is primarily the    
 magazine of the 6 Stodden Churches -  
 Dean, Melchbourne, Pertenhall,        
 Shelton, Swineshead and Yelden - but  
 is used as a calender of events and   
 supplier of news around the villages. 
 The Vicar is the Editor whilst a team 
 of voluntary helpers aid him in       
 typing, duplicating, collating and    
 distributing this monthly magazine.   
 There are several Notice Boards in the
 villages which are usually            
 well-covered with posters of          
 forthcoming events.                   
 The Post Office and Spar Shop are also
 always willing to stick up similar    
 posters.                              
 Most news and details of events       
 travels very quickly by word of mouth!
