		<content> The Friesian Holstein is the best cow 
 for milking in this area. It can be   
 red and white as well as the better   
 known black and white. The Friesian   
 was brought from Holland in the 18th  
 Century because of a cattle plague in 
 Britain.                              
 These days the cows are milked twice a
 day. A tanker comes in the morning,   
 but not in the evening. Most of the   
 milk is taken to Hawes Dairy (four    
 miles away) where it is made into     
 butter and cheese, but some is        
 distributed locally. No milking is    
 done by hand unless a cow's tit is    
 bad. The cattle are wintered in the   
 byres and put out to the pastures in  
 mid-Spring according to the weather.  
 Hay and silage are made locally, but  
 much has to be brought in. The 1984   
 EEC milk quota has resulted in smaller
 herds and more meat production.       </content>
