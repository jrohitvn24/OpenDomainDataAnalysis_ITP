		<title>03THE RIVER DOVE</title>
		<content>    The River Dove follows a meandering
 path towards Uttoxeter and the South. 
 At some points the river is as wide as
 20 feet and probably as deep as 15    
 feet. The river doesn't flow very fast
 but after severe rain it has been     
 known to burst its banks and flood    
 considerable areas, despite some      
 steeply banked parts.Two large iron   
 bridges are in use for crossing the   
 river.The Dove also provides good     
 canoeing and fishing especially perch 
 and salmon.A permit must be obtained  
 before fishing can take place,either  
 from Uttoxeter County Council or      
 J.C.Bamfords.                         
 On either side of the river the land  
 is used for farming, mainly beef or   
 milking cattle. A wide variety of     
 wildlife and flowers are also hosted  
 by the river, along with the Churnet, 
 one of the Doves small tributaries.   </content>
