		<content>{The Axe Valley.                       
         The Axe valley runs north     
 south through the most eastern part of
 county Devon. The valley is typically 
 broad with a very clear flood plain.  
 The river floods this area each year  
 around spring. As a result the valley 
 floor is dominated by pastrol farming.
 Most fo the farmsteads and the roads  
 in the valley avoid flooding by being 
 located on the valley sides.          
        The sides of the valley are    
 flanked by Greensand hills which rise 
 to nearly 500 metres at Trinity hill. 
        The sandstone ridge to the east
 is capped by clay with flints and this
 supports a Heath like vegetation,or   
                                       
 planted conifers. The valley sides are
 devoted to high quality pasture and   
 ley grass.Asimular pattern exists to  
 the west of the valley                </content>
