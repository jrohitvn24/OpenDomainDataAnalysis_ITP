		<content> Whitburn Church dates back to the     
 thirteenth century.It has a square    
 tower with a stunted spire,which is   
 visible as a landmark for passing     
 ships.                                
  A weeping chancel leads the eye      
 towards the drooping head of Christ on
 the cross,depicted in the east window.
  Outside,there are many things of     
 interest,a Lych Gate,an Early Norman  
 Font and a stone coffin with the shape
 of scissors etched into the lid.      
  The Methodist Chapel is also well    
 established.Its roof is supposed to   
 resemble an upturned fishing boat.    
  The Catholic Church has only been    
 established in Whitburn for a         
 relatively short time and a temporary 
 building has recently been replaced by
 a permanent structure.
