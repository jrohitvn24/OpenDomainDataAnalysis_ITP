 The Norfolk Bridge that crosses the   
 River Adur is today having a lot of   
 work done as it is too narrow for big 
 lorries. It is only 18 feet wide and  
 two lorries find it hard to pass each 
 other;this causes long traffic        
 jams. The bridge is 61O feet long. The
 arches were built in 1923,now they are
 pulling them down. It will cost       
 Â£2,5OO,OOO to build a steel frame     
 underneath a concrete deck and widen  
 it to 24 feet. The bridge will have   
 safety railings along each side. The  
 bridge used to be a toll bridge; one  
 of the old toll houses is still there 
 as a private home. In 1927 the toll   
 was stopped. The pub near the bridge, 
 the King's Head,is being pulled down  
 to make the road wider and allow for  
 redevelopment.
