		<title>12EMPLOYMENT IN SALTBURN</title>
		<content> Saltburn is a dormitory town and many 
 people have to travel to work finding 
 employment in large industries located
 in Redcar and Middlesbrough. ICI and  
 British Steel are major employers of  
 the local communities. Very few jobs  
 are available in Saltburn. Most are   
 part time jobs in small offices and   
 shops. Seasonal work is limited to the
 holdiay period and found mainly along 
 the seafront. Saltburn,like many towns
 in Cleveland has many unemployed with 
 the youngest being hit the hardest.   
 This is because they lack the skills  
 and experience needed to work in these
 industries.The long term outlook is   
 poor. Cleveland has suffered from the 
 current decline in industry and towns 
 like Saltburn have been affected. In  
 January 1985 unemployment totalled 621
 (22.1% of the workforce). At the same 
 time 2798 were in employment.         </content>
