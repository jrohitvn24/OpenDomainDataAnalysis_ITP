		<content> Procter and Gamble is a company which 
 produces detergent, soap and personal 
 care products.                        
                                       
 There are some Procter and Gamble     
 offices in Gosforth. They are set in  
 8 acres of land. There are 450 people 
 working in these offices.             
                                       
 The offices opened in 1953. They are  
 used for a number of things. They     
 organise their advertising here. There
 is also a public relations department.
 This is where complaints are dealt    
 with.                                 
                                       
 Procter and Gamble have two royal     
 warrants which means that they can    
 supply their products to the Royal    
 Family.
