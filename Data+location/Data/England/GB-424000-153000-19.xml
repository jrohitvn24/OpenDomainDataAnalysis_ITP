 On October 20th. our village had a fun
 run to raise money to pay for the     
 showers at the new village hall. It   
 was a hot afternoon. All the runners  
 met at the recreation ground at       
 2.30p.m.. There were 86 of us         
 altogether.We had to run along Cadley 
 to the Shears Inn,then up the hill to 
 Herridge Farm and Tinkerbarn. From    
 there it was downhill through Brunton 
 and Collingbourne Kingston and along  
 the main road to the Recreation groumd
 again. The course was five and a half 
 miles long.The start was made by Mr.  
 Gordon firing a shot gun and then we  
 all charged out of the field and down 
 Chick's Lane. It took me 45 minutes   
 and I broke my record of last year of 
 46 minutes.My mum got in 10 minutes   
 after me.We all had medals for        
 finishing.A big crowd was there.      </content>
