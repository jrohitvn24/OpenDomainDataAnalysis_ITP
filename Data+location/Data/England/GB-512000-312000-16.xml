		<title>16HOUSES IN LANGTOFT</title>
		<content> We thought it might be interesting    
 to see how many houses are in the     
 village, what sort and also what      
 they are made of.Langtoft is a small  
 village on a crossroads of the fen    
 road and the A15.Most of Langtoft is  
 quite new but some of the houses in   
 the middle of the village are very    
 old.                                  
      The village has got two shops,a  
 post office,a pub called the Waggon   
 and Horses,a garage,a butchers and a  
 hairdressers.The village has existed  
 for well over a thousand years.The    
 village has got one church,St Micheal 
 and All Angels which is made of stone 
 and has cementry round it,there is a  
 new cemetry along side the A15 at the 
 South End of the village.We are doing 
 a house survey to see how many        
 houses,cottages etc, there are.The    
 village contains 397 houses.          </content>
