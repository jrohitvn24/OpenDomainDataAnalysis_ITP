		<title>01THE AREA WEST OF STROUD</title>
		<content>      The River Frome runs through a   
 valley in the south of the area.To the
 north the land rises gradually towards
 Randwick and to the south it rises    
 steeply towards Selsley Hill and      
 Common. These beautiful hills mark the
 edge of the Cotswolds and overlook the
 wide Severn Vale. There are a large   
 number of houses especially at Ebley  
 and Stonehouse in the valley; Randwick
 is a small hill village of Cotswold   
 stone houses, while Stonehouse is a   
 growing town.  In the Frome Valley the
 A419 runs parallel to the main-line   
 railway passing through Stroud and    
 Stonehouse.There is also the derelict 
 Stroudwater Canal. A cycle track has  
 recently been made on the old railway 
 line which was used by the Dudbridge  
 Donkey. At some places along the river
 there are mills which once produced   
 cloth.                                </content>
