		<content> The Tannery is useful to the area     
 because it is one of Downton's main   
 employers.                            
{The Parish Church of St. Laurence.    
 St. Laurence church dates back to     
 1150 but the original Norman building 
 has been enlarged. Two bays have been 
 added to make a cross shape. In 1791, 
 the church tower was extended by 30   
 feet so that Lord Radnor could see it 
 from his estate. In 1860, it was      
 lowered to its original height for    
 safety reasons. Inside the chapel arch
 there is s hole called the 'priest's  
 squint:' this allowed the priest at   
 the altar in the side chapel to see   
 what the priest at the high altar was 
 doing. The church tower has eight     
 bells the oldest of which is dated    
 1604. The oldest of the log books     
 dates back to 1599. We spoke to Canon 
 D. Letcher, Vicar of St. Laurence's.  </content>
