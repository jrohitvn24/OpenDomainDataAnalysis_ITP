		<content> The population of Braceby and         
 Sapperton was 64 persons at the time  
 of the{1981 census,}comprised of 35   
 males and 29 females. The population  
 was made up of 18 children aged less  
 than 16 years, 33 adults aged 16 to 64
 years, and 13 persons over the        
 retirement age of 65 years. Declining 
 employment in agriculture and the     
 improvement and modernisation of many 
 houses have been factors in bringing  
 about significant change in the social
 structure of the community. In 1981   
 only two households in the two        
 villages were without a car, and more 
 than half of all households had two or
 more cars. The present total of 21    
 households in the two villages        
 compares with a figure of 35 families 
 at the time of Domesday 1085.
