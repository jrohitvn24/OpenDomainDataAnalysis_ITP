		<content>     Theed Estates have drawn up a 40  
 year plan for the development of the  
 area.   Having bought the estate in   
 1964 the first job was to launch a    
 restoration plan.    During the period
 l970-80 the{replanting of the derelict
{woodlands}took top priority.   But    
 work on the house was also put in     
 hand, the slate roof was repaired and 
 the drainage overhauled.   By using an
 old print from 1783 it was possible to
 make a good job of restoring the Gate 
 house entrance tower.   There is still
 work that is going to be done on the  
 rest of the Gate house.               
     The old Cornmill which has now    
 been reroofed and repaired externally 
 will become the centre for an         
{important education programme}once it 
 has been improved inside.
