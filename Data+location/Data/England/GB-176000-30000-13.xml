		<title>13THE CHURCH OF ST. BUDOC</title>
		<content> Our Church dates from the thirteenth  
 century and is of great historical    
 interest.                             
 The legend of St. Budoc tells of an   
 unusual journey before the foundation 
 of a settlement here:                 
 'Azenor was the only daughter of the  
 widowed King of Brest.Having no male  
 heir, the king married again.His new  
 wife was jealous of her step-daughter.
 When Azenor married the Count of      
 Goello and became pregnant the step-  
 mother arranged to have her convicted 
 of adultery.Azenor was cast into the  
 sea in a barrel which washed up on the
 coast of Ireland where monks carefully
 opened it to reveal Azenor and her    
 baby, born during the journey.The     
 Abbot promised mother and baby        
 shelter.The boy became a monk and     
 later an Abbot.He founded a settlement
 here.'                                </content>
