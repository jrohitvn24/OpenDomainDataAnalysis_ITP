		<content>      Mr. Berry got up at 7 o' clock,  
 dressed and had a drink at 7.30. At   
 about 7.50 he put his overalls and    
 boots on and went to feed the cows,   
 which took about 45 minutes.Then he   
 took the snow plough off the Uni-mog  
 and altered it. At 10 o' clock he had 
 his coffee break.                     
      At 12.30 he had his dinner break,
 which lasted until 1.30. When he went 
 back to work he did an alteration on  
 the crop spray. At 3 o' clock Mr.     
 Berry made a new belt for the drill,  
 took the tractor away and put the snow
 plough frame with the snow plough.    
      At 5 o' clock he went home.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
