{________________________________}     
 My name is{Christopher Baker,}I am 11 
 years old. This morning I got up at   
 07.00.  I washed and had egg and      
 sausage for breakfast. After breakfast
 I walked to school. The bell rang at  
 8.45. We said morning prayers and then
 did some maths. I have been doing     
 capacity (volume) and fractions. At   
 10.30 we had playtime, I played       
 football.Afterwards I did some English
 until lunchtime.    Most children have
 school lunch, they cost 67 pence      
 each.I bring sandwiches. In the       
 afternoon we did creative activities. 
 I am making a net. some children are  
 spinning and weaving. At 15.00 we went
 home and I had baked beans on toast   
 for tea. In the evening I helped my   
 dad to build some shooting butts . At 
 21.00 I went to bed.                  </content>
