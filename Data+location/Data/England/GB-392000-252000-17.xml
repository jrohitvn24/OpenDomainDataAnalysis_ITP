		<title>17Education; Upton Snodsbury</title>
		<content> The only school is a Church of England
 'first school' at Upton Snodsbury. It 
 takes children up to 9 years of age.  
 There are 38 pupils. Pupils over 9    
 years old go on to comprehensive      
 schools in Worcester or Pershore.     
 Upton Snodsbury School has a staff of 
 two, the headmistress and one other   
 trained teacher. The school would be  
 closed if numbers drop below 25. The  
 school building is part Victorian and 
 part modern, and is well equipped.    
 It has a very happy atmosphere and    
 when visited children were playing    
 outside in the lunch hour while others
 were enjoying a recorder lesson.      
                                       
 Some children go to private schools   
 out of the area.
