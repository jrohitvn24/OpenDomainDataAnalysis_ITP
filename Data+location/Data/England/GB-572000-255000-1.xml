		<content>Wickhambrook and Lidgate are S.E.of    
Newmarket on the B1063.Both villages   
are in a rich agricultural area where  
cereals are the principal crops.       
However farming is no longer the major 
occupation and the work force of both  
villages is largely employed in nearby 
towns. Modern housing has blended with 
the older but modernized cottages. The 
social life however,has largely stayed 
in the villages so they both have a    
strong community spirit and co-ordinate
events.There is an evident change in   
shopping habits, matching patterns of  
employment.Most local industry has gone
replaced by modern enterprises.A wide  
range of services are provided from    
outside.Increased family mobility is   
responsible which is reflected in the  
fall in demand for public transport.
