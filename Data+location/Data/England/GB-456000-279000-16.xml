		<title>16EVENTS IN THE VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The{Village Hall}was built in 1911 for
 the Oddfellows Society and purchased  
 by the village in 1956 with funds     
 raised by villagers. Today it is      
 self-supporting with trustees and a   
 Committee of Management.{Revenues}come
 from hiring, fund raising, socials and
 public grants enabling recent         
 improvements to be made including a   
 new toilet extension and conversion of
 the adjoining old carpenter's shop    
 into a smaller meeting room. The Hall 
 is used regularly for badminton, the  
 Women's Institute, an over sixties    
 club, amateur dramatics, Sunday       
 school, Parish and Parochial Church   
 Council meetings and public and       
 private village functions. The        
 Village Hall is an important centre of
 Swinford village life.
