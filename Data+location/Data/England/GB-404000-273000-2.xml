		<title>02RAISING MONEY FOR CHARITY</title>
		<content>   There was a sponsored walk along a  
 half mile stretch of the unopened     
 M42.There was a fair so you could have
 a break from walking.At each end of   
 the walk there were people who gave   
 you a sticker every time you completed
 half a mile.They were given out so    
 that nobody cheated. Some of the      
 participants were dressed up.There    
 were clowns and convicts.There were   
 about 2000 people there while I was   
 walking.The money raised went to the  
 Oesophageal Cancer Reserch appeal at  
 East Birmingham  Hospital.{M.Green    
 In Christian Aid Week Silvermead third
 year organized a fund raising         
 scheme.We baked cakes,brought toys and
 comics to sell.We also had some       
 raffles .Altogether we raised Â£35.{
