		<content>    Lowther Gardens provides well laid 
 out gardens,tennis courts,bowling     
 greens,putting and crazy golf.There is
 also a modern theatre where a         
 performance is generally showing,and a
 cafe where you can obtain refreshments
 and snacks.                           
   The present windmill was built in   
 1805 and it's original sails were     
 45ft. long and covered in canvas.     
 Lytham windmill is about 50ft. high   
 and 50ft. wide.The windmill has not   
 ground grain since 1919 when it was   
 gutted by fire.The windmill is an     
 attractive landmark for tourists,but  
 still there have not been enough      
 efforts made to restore it.It always  
 seems to look in need of a coat of    
 paint and the idea of transforming the
 inside into a museum has not yet been 
 carried out.                          
                                       </content>
