 girls of{Havergal College,Toronto,   }
 Canada whose choir visited Aberford in
 March 1984.                           
 Dear Mrs. Tait,                       
               Thanks very much for    
 organizing Havergal's stay in Aberford
 and I speak for all of us when I say  
 that the Aberford visit was the most  
 enjoyable part of our British tour. We
 shall all remember the hospitality and
 kindness that was shown to us.        
                          Yours truly  
                         Suzann Gordon
