		<content>  Public transport on the roads        
 throughout the study area is very     
 limited.The{A27}to the South has      
 three main services.A South Coast     
 service runs between{Portsmouth}and   
{Brighton}whilst two local buses       
 connect{Emsworth with Chichester}and  
{Selsey}and{Bosham}with{Chichester. }  
  The village of{West Ashling}has only 
 two buses a week, travelling to       
 Chichester.To the North of the area   
 regular services connect Chichester   
 with outlying villages and Chichester 
 with Westbourne.                      
  The{British Rail}stations at{Bosham} 
 and{Fishbourne}lie just North of the  
{A27}road.Regular services run between 
 Portsmouth and London and link the    
 South Coast towns e.g. Brighton,      
 Southampton.The line is electrified.  
  Ownership of a  car-especially in the
 isolated areas would appear essential.</content>
