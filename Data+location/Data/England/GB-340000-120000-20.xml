		<title>20Village Changes,Kingsbury.</title>
		<content> Living in the village 40 years ago one
 knew all the villagers personally,    
 whereas in recent years so many people
 ,with jobs outside the area,have      
 settled here that the community as a  
 whole is not so close knit.The        
 appearance of the village has improved
 ;there are few derelict cottages as   
 these are often attractively          
 renovated.

 The children of Kingsbury Episcopi    
 Primary School,Class 3,compiled these 
 pages from information collected by   
 interview,and by talks given to them  
 by local people,in their working      
 surroundings.The children would like  
 to thank all the parents and other    
 villagers for their kind help.        </content>
