		<title>02AROUND AND ABOUT LALEHAM</title>
		<content>  We live on the borders of{Staines and
 Laleham.It is really quite peaceful   
 here.London Airport is very near but  
 the planes don't go over very much so 
 it is quite quiet.                    
  There are a few busy roads like the  
 Kingston Road but most of the roads   
 are full of houses for people to live 
 in.                                   
  There are a few shops in our area but
 they are not very big.They are        
 collected up in two places called     
{Edinburgh Drive and the Broadway}and  
 there are some odd ones by            
 themselves.There is not a bank here   
 but there are 2 post offices.There are
 a few schools and places for children 
 to go like                            
 Cubs,Brownies,swimming,dancing and    
 gymnastics.There are 2 or 3 parks to  
 play in It is really a nice place to  
 live.                                 </content>
