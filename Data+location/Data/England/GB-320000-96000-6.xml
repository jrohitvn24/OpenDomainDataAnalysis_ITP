		<content> Umborne is the only hamlet of any     
 size within the area &amp; has no acknowl-
 edged centre. There is no shop, PO or 
 public house.It really consists of Big
 Umborne, Little Umborne, Pottlelake   
 and Chandlers Hall. The village hall  
 is a converted World War 2 nissen hut 
 (see photo). There is a Victorian     
 pillar box, sited under the railway   
 bridge &amp; an area of grass known the   
 'green'. No classified roads pass     
 through the village or buses &amp;        
 private transport is essential.It is  
 purely a farming/residential/retire-  
 ment backwater set in very attractive 
 countryside well away from most of the
 trappings of modern life. In the      
 1930's mains water arrived and mains  
 drainage does not yet exist. The      
 average age of the population is      
 high,few children,no school or play-
