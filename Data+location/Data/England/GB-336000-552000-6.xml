		<content> The Pirelli tyre factory is a very big
 factory near to our school.Many of the
 people who work there live in the     
 houses around our school.The factory  
 was opened in 1969 and employs 680 men
 and 10 women.When Pirelli decided to  
 build another factory they looked at  
 sites in a number of towns.They       
 decided on Carlisle because the area  
 has the right kind of water needed to 
 make tyres and they were able to drill
 a bore hole on the site.There is a    
 good labour force in the city and     
 there are good road and rail          
 communications with the rest of       
 Britian.The firm pays Â£254,000 to the 
 council in rent and rates every year  
 for the site.The factory is open      
 twenty-four hours a day seven days a  
 week with three shifts of workers     
 operating the plant each day.
