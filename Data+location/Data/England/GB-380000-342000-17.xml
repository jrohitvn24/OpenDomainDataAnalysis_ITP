		<title>17LANDSCAPE:NEWCASTLES HOUSING</title>
		<content> Our survey block holds two of         
Newcastle's most expensive housing     
estates. They are Seabridge and the    
Westlands. They both consist mainly of 
large detached owner-occupied houses   
and even some flats.                   
 As we work out toward the M6 the      
houses become isolated farmhouses.     
There are some people living in Keele  
University. The housing there is-      
hotel style, single, double and triple 
rooms for the students.                
 Past the M6 are small villages like   
Butterton. The houses here are large,  
old, pretty and very expensive.        
 To summarise all of this, the houses  
in our survey are mainly large,        
expensive and owner-occupied. Some are 
part of estates, some part of tiny     
villages and some completely isolated.
