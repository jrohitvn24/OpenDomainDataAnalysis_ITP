		<title>05SENIOR CITIZENS LUNCHES.</title>
		<content>   Every week senior citizens come to  
 school for lunch.We are lucky,we have 
 our own cook and the lunches are very 
 tasty.                                
   The old people are so interesting   
 and we learn to understand each       
 other.We like to think that they know 
 we care about them.Some of us         
 entertain and others serve them.      
   When they have finished their       
 lunch,they have a cup of tea and a    
 chat.Then we show them our work and   
 then wave them good bye.              
   We think it is lovely having old    
 people in to school because they are  
 so nice and we like to help.          
   It is really good because they do   
 not have to make their own dinner or  
 wash their own dishes.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
