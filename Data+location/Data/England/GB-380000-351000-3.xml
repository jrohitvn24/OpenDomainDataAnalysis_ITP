		<title>03Great Oak Farm near Talke</title>
		<content> On 14th May 1985 Jane,Karen,Mandy,    
Vanessa and Elizabeth went to          
visit Great Oak Farm,owned by Mr       
D.R.Cole.He  appeared with his dogs    
Caesar and Holly and walked to a       
garden gate by the farm track to       
answer questions.He had 76 cattle and  
14 fields.He told us about some pigs   
which dug up coins,every Sunday,but he 
has'nt any pigs now.We saw some        
Charolais calves about  5 weeks old.He 
told us about the nail makers who      
lived at the farmhouse.At the milking  
parlour he showed us a spiked piece of 
metal which he fixed to a cow's nose   
to prevent it from sucking other cow's 
udders.We also saw a breeding board    
like a circular calendar with markers  
to show each cow's calving time.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
