		<title>16AN EVENING ACTIVITY.</title>
		<content>   It is very tiring getting home from 
 school,doing my homework, having my   
 tea and going to Cadets, but I enjoy  
 it. Before leaving I polish my boots, 
 put on my uniform and pack my knife   
 and gaters. At around 6.10p.m. I leave
 home and cycle the three miles to the 
 local Sea Cadets, and usually meet my 
 friends there. The night seems to go  
 very quickly as we march and drill,   
 learn about different aspects of      
 sailing and life in the Royal Navy. We
 usually have a break in the middle of 
 each session and I normally take some 
 money with me to buy a drink and some 
 sweets.                               
   Once inside the Cadets Centre we use
 all the same terms as the Navy and,   
 although we sometimes forget, it makes
 the evening very different.
