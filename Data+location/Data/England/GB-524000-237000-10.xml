		<title>10PUBLIC TRANSPORT</title>
		<content> You really need a car if you live in  
 Ashwell or Newnham.                   
 There is a{railway station}on the line
 between Hitchin and Cambridge and     
 there are frequent electric trains to 
 Kings Cross, London. But the station  
 is about 2 Km. from Ashwell and you   
 need a bike or car to get there.      
 There is still a{bus service}through  
 Ashwell and Newnham which lie on the  
 journey between Royston and Baldock.  
 The bus is very infrequent.           
 People who can't afford cars have to  
 walk or get around by bike.This really
 means that they have to stay in the   
 village for most of the time. Many    
 people complained about the{poor bus  
{service.}They said it used to be much 
 better. People said that lack of good 
 public transport was one of the worst 
 things about living in Ashwell.       
                                       </content>
