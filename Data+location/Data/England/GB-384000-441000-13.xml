		<title>13BLACKO TOWER</title>
		<content> From{BLACKO TOWER}you can see all our 
 Domesday block. The tower was built by
{Johnathan Stansfield}in 1890 and      
 restored in 1950, helped by           
 contributions from the villagers of   
 Blacko. You can see into the Yorkshire
 Dales, Nelson and Burnley from the top
 of the tower. All the people in our   
 school went up there in June 1985.    
 Johnathan built the tower to see over 
 into Ribblesdale but he could not     
 because of the bigger hills in front  
 of him. When people asked him why he  
 built the tower he said, "I've never  
 drunk or smoked in my life so I'm     
 making this my hobby". He died in 1894
 aged 71 and the tower still stands    
 there on the top of the hill. Each    
 year, on{BLACKO SPORTS DAY,}the       
 children of Blacko race to the Tower  
 and back.
