		<content> From our questionnaire we found that  
 as expected dogs and cats were the    
 most popular pets in our area. Other  
 pets owned by people in our district  
 were rabbits, hamsters, tortoises,    
 birds- includes canaries, budgerigars,
 doves, and a finch- guinea pigs, mice,
 gerbils.                              
  The number of goldfish kept          
 was the most but 56 of the goldfish   
 out of 65 were owned by just two      
 people. A tradition of this area is   
 the racing of pigeons. Two people out 
 of over one hundred said they had     
 racing pigeons.Recently many people   
 have started to keep more exotic pets 
 but from our survey we found only     
 two.Both spiders one was a red knee   
 and the other a tarantula!
