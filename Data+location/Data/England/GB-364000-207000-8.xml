		<title>08DRUMMER BOY STONE</title>
		<content>   A few hundred metres to the north of
 Blackpool Bridge can be found a large 
 stone near the roadside with two      
 hollows on its upper side, one        
 containing 'iron'. Many theories exist
 to explain its position : it held     
 sacrificial blood, it was a mould to  
 hold molten iron or it marks the grave
 of a Drummer Boy. The second is       
 thought to be the most reliable.      
   The fused metallic substance in the 
 hollow is not iron but slag produced  
 by iron-ore working or 'smithing'. It 
 is probable that the stone formed the 
 base of a small hearth made of clay   
 and stones and blown with a bellows.  
 This early period of iron working is  
 known as the Bloomery period and the  
 method was very wasteful. It was not  
 until the 17th Century that blast     
 furnaces were introduced.
