		<title>12PARKS NEAR CHILDS HILL</title>
		<content> There are three main parks near Childs
 Hill school. {Basing Hill Park} opens 
 at 7.00am. It has a slide, a swing,   
 see-saws and tennis courts. There are 
 only a few flowers but many trees like
 silver birch, oaks etc. Many people go
 there to jog as there is a lot of     
 space. the grass is short and we have 
 our school sports day there. {Childs  
{Hill Park}is similar but it is bigger 
 and has a bowling green where mostly  
 old people play. There are football   
 goals as well. Rounders, netball and  
 cricket are also played there. We can 
 ride our bikes too. There is a lot to 
 see in{Golders Hill Park.}There are   
 animals like llamas, deer and goats.  
 there is a lot of woodland where      
 squirrels and rabbits can be seen.    
 there are two little bridges over a   
 pond where swans, ducks and flamingoes
 live. There's a bandstand and cafe too</content>
