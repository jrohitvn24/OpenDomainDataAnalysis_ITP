		<content>  The Yelverton Golf Club was          
 established in 1904 when there were   
 only nine holes and a wooden hut. By  
 1911 there were eighteen holes, and by
 1925 the present club house had been  
 built. Today there are some 500       
 members. Non members are charged a fee
 of Â£9.50 per round and the use of     
 changing facilities.                  
  Horse riding over Roborough Down is  
 much enjoyed.                         
  Many people come to sit, picnic, or  
 walk on the down and enjoy the        
 moorland scenery and the sight of the 
 ponies and sheep grazing.             
  Litter from these visitors can be    
 a problem to the animals and sometimes
 causes fires. Each summer term        
 children from th Tavistock            
 Comprehensive School work with a      
 ranger to clear some of the rubbish.
