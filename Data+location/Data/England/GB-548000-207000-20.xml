		<title>20MASHAM'S COTTAGE-TILEGATE</title>
		<content> S.W. corner:{510090}The hamlet of     
 TILEGATE GREEN straddles the by-road  
 running east towards HIGH LAVER. The  
 huge grainfields characteristic of    
 arable farming in the mid 1980's      
 stretch far on either side. Many of   
 the farms &amp; houses here date back over
 centuries &amp; are much cared for by the 
 owners. One such is Mr. Shuttleworth  
 the owner of MASHAMS a delightful     
 thatched wattle &amp; daub cottage        
 possibly once belonging to a yeoman   
 farmer. Long-term subsidence is posing
 some threat as the adjacent pond,     
 possibly either the remains of a moat 
 or merely the hole left after removal 
 of clay for building. The cottage was 
 bought in 1925 for Â£360 and now some  
 60 years later could well bring       
 Â£90,000 plus. Mr. Shuttleworth is     
 hoping that MASHAMS will possibly     
 become a museum eventually.           </content>
