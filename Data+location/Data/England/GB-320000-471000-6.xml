 which uses the rock to make           
 bricks,concrete and tarmac.There are  
 19 workers and it is a very dangerous 
 place beacause of the large machinery 
 used and the explosions for blasting  
 the rock away from the hillside.In    
 order to extract the rock from the    
 hillside several holes are drilled in 
 the rock.The holes are filled with    
 blasting jelly and diesel fuel.A cable
 connects each hole to a plunge
