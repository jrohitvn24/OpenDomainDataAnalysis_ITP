		<content>    About 1310 the south aisle was     
 enlarged to it's present width and the
 windows at the west end are Decorated 
 in style. Towards the end of Edward   
 III's reign the north aisle was       
 enlarged in Perpendicular style as the
 windows show. About 1450 the south    
 porch was built. Above it is a small  
 room once used as a school room. Most 
 of the stained glass was put in at the
 beginning of the 20th century but     
 there are still some examples of      
 medieval glass especially the         
 so-called 'John of Gaunt' panel in the
 south aisle.
