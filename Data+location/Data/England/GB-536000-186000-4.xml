		<title>04LEYTONSTONE LIFESTYLES.</title>
		<content>{Leytonstone }has lots of              
 shops,especially food shops. There is 
 a new "Texas-Homecare" Superstore     
 being built to sell hardware,furniture
 and many things to repair your house  
 with. It is also good for other things
 like providing employment.            
    People in Leytonstone can enjoy    
 themselves in their spare time because
 there's a Recreation Centre here. My  
 Mum plays Squash there sometimes and I
 go swimming. That's one thing that I  
 like about Leytonstone.               
   I'm not so keen on Leytonstone      
 because it's too messy;it's covered   
 with rubbish and nobody seems to pick 
 it up. Leytonstone should have a      
 Cinema because otherwise you have to  
 go right up to London to see a film.  
 Leytonstone has a lot of corner shops 
 which means that shopping can be quick
 and easy.                             </content>
