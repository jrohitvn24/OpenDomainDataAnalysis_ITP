		<title>01NEW ALRESFORD HAMPSHIRE</title>
		<content>    {New Alresford}(population 4219 for
 the 1982 Census) a rural town packed  
 with antique, book and art shops. The 
 name means 'ford by the alders' and is
 pronounced 'Allsford'; New isn't used,
 although the ajoining village is 'Old 
 Alresford'.                           
     The town is situated between      
 Winchester and Farnham on the busy A31
 road.A bypass has just been started   
 after many years of waiting.          
     Alresford is a smart residential  
 area and was already a busy corn,     
 woollen, farming and sheep-market town
 when William the Conqueror settled in 
 Winchester. Now it is associated with 
 agriculture and is the centre of a    
 thriving watercress industry. Hence,  
 also, the so called Watercress Railway
 Line.
