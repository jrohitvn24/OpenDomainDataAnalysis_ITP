		<content> do maths until 10.40am when we go out 
 to play. In the summer we play in the 
 large field behind the school. In     
 winter we play in the play-ground. we 
 have hop-scotch grids printed out on  
 the tarmac and a net-ball pitch. After
 play at 11.00am we go back into class 
 for English until dinner-time which is
 12.00noon.                            
 I go home for dinner those staying    
 usually have a hot meal and a sweet.  
 At 1.00pm school starts and lessons   
 last until play-time at 2.30pm.We can 
 buy crisps at 5p for a small packet.At
 2.50pm the bell goes and we go back in
 side.We sometimes do P.E.using the    
 equipment in the hall and do          
 exercises.                            
 At 3.00pm its hometime. We have clubs 
 after school but I normally go        
 straight home to play on my computer  
 or watch TV.                          </content>
