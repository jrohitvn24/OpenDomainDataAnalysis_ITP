		<content>{Catterick Village}lies to the south of
 the River Swale,and to the east of the
 main A1 road.{The Great North Road    
 once went through Catterick           
 Village, and since the Catterick      
 Bypass was built heavy traffic is kept
 well clear of the village.In 1984 the 
 roundabouts on the A1 were removed and
 replaced by slip roads and            
 flyovers,this has helped to ease      
 traffic flow problems.                
 The area has Roman connections and is 
 a rich source of local history.       
 There are old stone cottages bordering
 Low Green and on the Low Green are    
 some of the oldest trees in Catterick.
 According to the{1981 Census,}the     
 population of Catterick was{2,709.    
 In the village there is a selection   
 of amenities including shops,hotels   
 and cafes, a health centre,a garage   
 and a primary school.                 </content>
