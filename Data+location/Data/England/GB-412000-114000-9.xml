		<title>09The Community Centre.</title>
		<content>   {The Community Centre,}originally   
 a{National School,}was built in       
 1835. The school had served all age   
 groups. In 1946 it became a{County    
{School.}It finally closed when the    
 new{County Junior and Infant Schools  
 in Pennys Lane were opened in 1974.   
    It had long been hoped to have a   
{Community Association}in the town, so 
 a steering committee was formed and   
{Avonway}came into being. In time it   
 became the home of many of the town's 
 established clubs such as the Camera  
 Club, Women's Institute etc. In time, 
 many new clubs were formed such as    
 Keep Fit, Yoga, Bridge and Skittles.  
 Avonway also houses a play-group for  
 the under-fives and adult education   
 classes.{The Avonford Youth Club}is   
 run by voluntary staff for children   
 from 7 to 14 years of age.{The County 
 runs a{Youth Club}for those over 14.  </content>
