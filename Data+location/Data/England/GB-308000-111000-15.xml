            Although school was not his
 favourite place Mr. Coombes always    
 tried hard to do his work perfectly   
 because he knew what would happen if  
 he made any mistakes!To prepare for   
 this the boys would hammer a nail into
 the cane so  any extra hard hit would 
 cause it to shatter.As well as        
 attending school by the age of ten Mr.
 Combes was working for the local      
 doctors.Before school he would do     
 anything they required and in the     
 evening he would return to heat the   
 water for the doctor's bath.Light     
 would come from oil lamps and candles 
 while cooking was done over a wood    
 burning stove.A good joint of meat    
 could be had for 6 pence and a pair of
 pig's skin boots which would cost Â£30 
 these days would cost a few shillings.
