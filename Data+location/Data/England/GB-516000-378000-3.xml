		<title>03COMMUNICATIONS IN PANTON</title>
		<content>{PANTON}has one daily postal delivery  
 brought by a red Royal Mail van.There 
 are three regular deliverers:one      
 woman and two men.They work on a rota 
 system.Because there is no post box or
 post office nearby,any out going mail 
 can be given to them to post. The     
 majority of the dwellings have a tele-
 phone connected to the Wragby exchange
 which is automatic.At Sotby House,the 
 farmer who also farms outside our area
 has a large private radio mast so that
 he has radio contact with his staff.  
  On average,once a year the residents 
 expect to be isolated by the snow.    
  This has happened for the past two   
 years and unless a farmer comes out   
 with a snow plough to clear the roads 
 then the lanes are impassable. The    
 Highways department also come         
 eventually to clear the roads.
