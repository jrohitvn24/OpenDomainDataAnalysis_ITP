		<content> Many Dorset dialect words are still in
 use, especially among those who have  
 always worked on the land. Cows still 
 BLEARE (low) and they shelter in the  
 LEW. A rogue beast is called a RAFTY  
 ONE and this may also be applied to   
 humans. Cattle are driven through     
 DRONGWAYS or DRONGS (narrow lanes or  
 passages). Bundles of sticks from     
 hedge trimming are NITCHES and smaller
 kindling NICKIES. A tree stump with   
 new growth is a MOCK, ants are EMMUTS 
 and anthills EMMUT BUTS. Midmorning   
 snack is a NAMMUT, a short length of  
 drain is a BUNNY. A notch is a SNOTCH,
 smoke or dust is a SMUCK, a muddle is 
 a HARDLE, apple or potato pulped is   
 PUMMIED. NESH is soft and tender,     
 SUANT is supple, workable. If you feel
 weak you are LEARY, something PLIMMED 
 is swollen, and VLANKERS still fly    
 from our bonfires.                    </content>
