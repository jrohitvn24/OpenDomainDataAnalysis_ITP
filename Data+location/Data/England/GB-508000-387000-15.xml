		<title>15MARKET RASEN-FEAST WEEK</title>
		<content> The traditional 'Feast-Week' was held 
 in May and October. There were        
 opportunities for trading in livestock
 as well as other business and         
 entertainments. The Market Place was  
 thronged with cattle and sheep, and   
 horses lined the length of Queen      
 Street. Gradually the week starting on
 the Monday, became a time for         
 enjoyment, so that by Saturday and    
 Sunday trains brought people for round
 about. By 1858 it was reported that   
 there were more visitors than before  
 with the greasy pole being            
 popular.After the Great War, the      
 custom faded out. In the late 1960's, 
 efforts were made by local business   
 men to revive the October Feast-Week. 
 This time the emphasis was on a trade 
 fair with carnival processions,       
 concerts and dances.
