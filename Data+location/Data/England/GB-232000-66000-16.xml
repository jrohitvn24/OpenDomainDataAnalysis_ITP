		<content>      This white{Victorian manor house 
 stands majestically at the top of     
 Newbridge Hill between Pencrebar Farm 
 and the A390. It is square in shape   
 and hidden by the trees and ornamental
 shrubs forming the 34 acre gardens.   
      Pencrebar was built in{1848}by

 occupants were the{Foot family. Isaac 
{Foot,}methodist, historian, Liberal   
 politician and one time mayor of      
 Plymouth bought the house in{1927.}It 
 was the venue for important Liberal   
 garden parties and Methodist          
 gatherings until his death in{1960}_  
 and also the home of his 52,000 books 
 (now at the University of California) 
     {Michael Foot}(Labour party       
 leader),{Sir Dingle Foot}Q.C. and{Lord

 their roots at Pencrebar.
