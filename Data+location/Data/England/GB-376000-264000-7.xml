		<content> In{1920,}following the death of Lady  
 Rachel Foley, Witley Court was sold to
{Sir Herbert Smith Bart.}who lived     
 there with his family. On the 7th     
 September{1937}in the owner's absence,
 a fire broke out near a kitchen       
 chimney and the centre of the building
 and the east wing were greatly damaged
 In{1938}after unsuccessful attempts to
 sell the estate, the contents of the  
 house were sold and also many fixtures
 and fittings. During the war years the
 house was in the hands of demolition  
 contractors and fell into a ruinous   
 condition. Parts of the estate were   
 sold in{1946}and{1950.}In{1954}the    
 ruins and adjoining gardens were      
 bought by{Mr. Wiginton}of Stratford.  
 At the present day the court is in the
 guardianship of the{Historic Buildings
{and Monuments Commission.
