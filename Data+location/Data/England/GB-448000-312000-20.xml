		<content> The Structure Plan quotes"Renowned for
 its crags and rugged beauty a major   
 recreation source for local           
 population". The pattern of undulating
 roads allows car riders to enjoy the  
 area.A birds eye view from a microlite
 shows people walking,rambling,jogging,
 rock climbing,cycling,kite and model  
 aircraft flying,picnickers at         
 Broombriggs Farm and the Beacon,      
 naturalists in the reserves. There are
 those enjoying horse riding or fox    
 hunting with the Quorn Hunt on a      
 Tuesday. Seasonal weather always      
 brings a crop of winter sports.
