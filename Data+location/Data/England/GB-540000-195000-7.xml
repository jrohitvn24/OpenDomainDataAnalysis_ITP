		<content>   The first people to settle locally  
 lived in the Mesolithic period        
 (c.8,000 B.C.). Of the Ancient British
 tribes the Catuvellauni settled here. 
 There are two camps in Epping Forest, 
 at Loughton Camp and at Ambresbury    
 Banks, from where legend has it that  
{Queen Boudicea}raised an army against 
 the Romans.                           
  {Dick Turpin,}the famous highwayman, 
 was resident in the area for many     
 years. He once roasted a woman in     
 Traps Hill over an open fire until she
 handed over her valuables. Whilst     
 hiding from the law in the forest he  
 shot and killed a keeper. He then fled
 the area and rode to York.            
   In 1882{Queen Victoria}dedicated    
 Epping Forest to the recreation of    
 Londoners for all time. She spoke to  
 500,000 people gathered at High Beach.
