		<title>18ECOLOGY IN SANDBACH</title>
		<content>{ECOLOGY}IN SANDBACH HAS BEEN CHANGED  
 BY THE NEW ROAD.{NATURE}HAS BEEN UPSET
 BY THE NEW ROAD WHICH HAS GONE THROUGH
{FARM-LAND}AND NATURE AREAS,ALSO IT HAS
 UPSET THE WILDLIFE IN THE AREA. IN THE
 NATURE AREAS SUCH  AS WOODS AND       
 FARM-LAND MANY FOOTPATHS HAVE BEEN    
 MADE.THE WEATHER IS UNPREDICTABLE,IT  
 NEVER KNOWS WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO    
 NEXT. IN SANDBACH THERE IS NOT A LOT  
 OF {POLLUTION}AS AROUND US THERE ISN'T
 ANY FACTORIES,BUT THERE IS            
 POLLUTION IN WATER AS PEOPLE EMPTY    
 PETROL INTO THE WATER. MANY ANIMALS   
 ARE RUN OVER BY CARELESS DRIVERS. IN  
 DINGLE LAKE SOME FISH DIE BECAUSE OF  
 THE LEAD IN THE WEIGHTS ALSO THE GEESE
 AND THE SWANS DIE OF THE SAME CAUSE.  
 RECENTLY THE AREA AROUND THE SAND     
 QUARRY HAS BEEN LAND-SCAPED AND IS    
 MUCH MORE PLEASING TO THE EYE.
