		<title>09FELMINGHAM VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The{Village Hall}was built in 1974,   
 replacing an old war-time Nissen Hut, 
 on land owned by the village at a cost
 of Â£12,000. Of this Â£8,000 was grants 
 from the Council. The adjoining       
 playing field is land leased from the 
 Church Commissioners.                 
 The Hall is the hub of Village life,  
 and money for its upkeep is raised by 
 an{Annual Fete,Flower &amp; Vegetable Show
 held on the first Saturday in August. 
 All the clubs using the Hall take     
 part.                                 
 Dances, Social Evenings and Concerts  
 are regularly held, and September l985
 sees the process of installing a      
 licensed bar well under way, to       
 further improve the social life in the
 Village.                              
 Most of the{Village Clubs}hold their  
 meetings in the Hall.
