		<title>15Children's game - Two ball</title>
		<content>   Two ball is a very good game.  You  
 sing a rhyme as you throw two balls   
 against a wall.  Here is a rhyme:     
  {Please miss, mother miss,           
{  Come to tell you this miss,         
{  I miss, won't miss,                 
{  Be at school tomorrow miss.         
 The rules are that you are throwing   
 the balls in a sort of juggling way   
 and if you drop one, then you are out 
 till it is your go again.  You can    
 have any number of people playing but 
 it is wise to have 3 as a maximum.    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
