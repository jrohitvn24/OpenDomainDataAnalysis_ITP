		<title>07ENGLEFIELD PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> A school was built in Englefield in   
 1865 to educate the Estate children.  
 It is still a Church of England       
 Primary School but most pupils travel 
 in from outside the estate. The main  
 building is the original school and an
 additional one was constructed in 1977
 to house an extra classroom and school
 kitchen. One boy described his day.   
 "After registration we do maths or    
 spelling and English work. Assembly   
 with the whole school is at 10:15.    
 Then it is break. We play bulldog. We 
 have swimming next because we can use 
 the Benyon's pool on the Estate. 12:00
 Dinner: fish and chips is my          
 favourite. In the afternoon we do     
 project work, and at break we play    
 rounders. After clearing up we have a 
 story together as a class. Then there 
 are prayers and home on the coach".
