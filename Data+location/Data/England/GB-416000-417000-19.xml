		<title>19A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE'S DAY</title>
		<content> At 5.OOam the alarm reminded me of the
 early start necessary to catch a plane
 from{Manchester}to{Gothenburg}in{     
{Sweden.}In{Britain}we import many     
 things like food and electonics goods 
 and so we must sell our products      
 abroad to earn money. As a small part 
 of this, I visit two{Swedish}Companies
 who buy parts of their trucks and cars
 from{England.}The flight to{Gothenburg
 took us over the {North Sea}where we  
 could see ships and oil rigs below us.
 On arrival in{Sweden}a car took us to 
 a large factory where the {buyers and 
{engineers}were waiting to meet us. The
 discussions with them were long and it
 was agreed we would start to sell to  
 them in 3 to 4 months. We visited     
 their works where we saw both{men and 
{robots}assembling huge trucks. At     
 about 7.OOpm we travelled to{Skovde}  
 where we spent the night.             </content>
