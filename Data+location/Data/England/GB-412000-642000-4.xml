		<title>04POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> In the village there is a small Post  
 Office.When the tide is out people    
 get their mail early in the morning,  
 but when the tide is  in the mail is  
 late.The Sub-Post Office has a Sub-   
 Postmaster. His name  is Ian.         
 Every morning the Post goes on to the 
 Mainland.Sometimes it has to go a bit 
 early in the morning,but sometimes it 
 has to go a bit later because the     
 Postman is waiting for the tide to    
 get off the road.It usually goes about
 11.30a.m.The Postman is               
 Mr.R.Patterson.                       
 Newspapers are brought at the same    
 time as the mail.
