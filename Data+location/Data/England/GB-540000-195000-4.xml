		<content>   At{St. John Fisher School}we do much
 the same as in an ordinary school. The
 difference is that every day there is 
 some religious activity. Sometimes a  
 hymn or a prayer is said at the       
 beginning of the day or there is an   
 assembly in which there are prayers.  
 There is grace before meals and we end
 the day with prayers. In R.E.         
 (Religious Education) children get to 
 know more about Jesus and about all   
 the parables he told. Sometimes on    
 special occassions the whole school   
 has a Mass. Either we walk to the     
 nearest church or a priest comes to   
 the school and says Mass there. We are
 taught to model ourselves on the life 
 of Jesus. Because we are a Catholic   
 school not all the children are local 
 but many come on coaches from places  
 like Epping, Ongar and Waltham Abbey.
