		<title>07ASHDOWN FOREST FIRE HAZARDS</title>
		<content> Spring and summer bring danger of fire
 to the Forest with loss of trees,     
 vegetation and wild-life. Fires are   
 often caused by the carelessness of   
 visitors who come to enjoy the        
 amenities which they also destroy -   
 not with intent but by a moment's     
 thoughtlessness. A cigarette end will 
 smoulder in the undergrowth and flare 
 into an inferno with terrifying speed.
 Burning bracken for agricultural      
 purposes can lead to disaster if not  
 carefully supervised. To combat these 
 fires the old remedy is still the most
 effective, beaters placed             
 strategically throughout the Forest.  
 Land Rovers with hoses are used and a 
 22,000 litre water tanker is held in  
 reserve. Fire stations on a wide      
 radius are on permanent standby. As a 
 desperate measure Army helicopters can
 be brought to the area.               </content>
