		<title>14My mum when she was my age.</title>
		<content> My mum's name is Sandra.She used to   
 live in Curlender Close up our street.
 When she was naughty, she was locked  
 in the front room and it was usually  
 very dark.She went to{Laird Street    
{School}which is now called{Portland   
{School}.My mum used to wear a green   
 uniform every day.My mum was born in  
 her house.My mum had a pet called     
 Rusty.Rusty died because he got       
 trapped under the sideboard and       
 somebody had to come and pull him out.
 He couldn't move his legs,so he was   
 put down.My mum has no brothers or    
 sisters.The meals at home were not    
 very nice but you would have to eat   
 them or else go to bed!New Year,Easter
 and Christmas were good but you didn't
 get many presents.My mum played out   
 with a boy who kept throwing snails at
 her;she didn't like it!
