		<title>13THE LIME KILN.</title>
		<content> There is a di sused lime kiln just    
 south east of Town Foot Farm near     
 Shilbottle, in square nine.It is six  
 metres across and built mainly from   
 sandstone,but partly brick at the     
 back.The kiln has been converted into 
 a cattle byre.                        
 On the roof there is a large hole     
 which was used for putting in the     
 twigs and branches which they were    
 going to burn.                        
 The lime was heated and when it cooled
 it was spread on the fields to help   
 the crops grow and stop the grass and 
 moss growing.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
