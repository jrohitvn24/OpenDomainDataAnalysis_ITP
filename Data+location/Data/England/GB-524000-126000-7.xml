 Warninglid School was built around    
 1885.The building looks like it was   
 once a chapel with its bell tower.The 
 school consists of 73 children, 4     
 teachers, 1 cleaner and 2 cooks. Most 
 of the pupils live outside Warninglid,
 so travel to school by either         
 car or bike;some walk.The school      
 has its own swimming pool, sandpit and
 climbing frame.The field on the side  
 of the school was bought from a       
 farmer.                               
  Most children from this area go on to
 Warden Park Comprehensive in Cuckfield
{STAPLEFIELD PLACE SCHOOL              
 In 1950 Staplefield Place School was  
 opened for handicapped children       
 age 5-17.In this school the children  
 have the same modern equipment as any 
 other school.
