{THE HIGH STREET:}Now a conservation   
 area,remains of cobbled street;many   
 timber framed houses c.1450 which are 
 now brick or plaster fronted.         
 Langtry's the Butchers is old enough  
 to have no original chimney.Shutters  
 suggest it was a shop in Tudor times. 
{ MANOR FARM:}c.1200,with a solar and a
 medieval roof and hall.The south wall 
 has three filled in arches which were 
 once doorways leading possibly to     
 sleeping quarters and courtyard.It is 
 possible that the kitchen was outside 
 to avoid cooking smells in living     
 quarters.Also the river which once ran
 down East and West Streets skirted the
 Manor on the south.Timber framed      
 buildings were added on the north side
 1550-1700.These have been brick faced 
 and a porch added to the front.
