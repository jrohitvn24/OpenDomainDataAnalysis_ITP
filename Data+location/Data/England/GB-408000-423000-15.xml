		<content>{THE CALDERDALE WAY}was established in 
 1974 to link public footpaths and     
 walks to make a long hike all the way 
 around the Calderdale border,passing  
 through places such as Ripponden,     
 Todmorden,Greetland and Brighouse.The 
 Calderdale Way is 55 miles long.Since 
 it was officially opened many         
 organisations have benefited from the 
 wildlife and plantlife which is varied
 in this area.Many tourists walk part  
 of the Way but only experienced hikers
 do the whole walk.                    
{THE SHAY}has three main facilites,a   
 football team,a speedway team and a   
 club where anyone can go and play     
 football with the team.The star of the
 speedway team is Kenny Carter,one of  
 the best riders in the world.The club 
 also runs a bar with a disco and a    
 restaurant.
