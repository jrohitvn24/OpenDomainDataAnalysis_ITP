		<content> Topographically the region can be     
 divided into 3 areas that run n-s: to 
 the east is an area of Rhaetic/Lwr.   
 Lias rocks at a height of 160 m. To   
 the west is a lowland of Keuper Marl. 
 A scarp face marks the junction of the
 two. Pastoral agriculture dominates   
 the landscape. Where the contours     
 allow this is intensively managed.    
 In the south-west corner of the area  
 are the two small villages of West and
 East Harptree, and the hamlet of      
 Hinton Blewitt is in the south-east   
 corner. Children from Hinton go to    
 school in Temple Cloud, by School     
 Transport, while there is a school in 
 East Harptree just south of the survey
 area.To the north-west is the Chew    
 Valley Lake, an important reservoir   
 and centre for water sports and       
 wildfowl.
