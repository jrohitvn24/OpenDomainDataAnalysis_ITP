 party. I wrapped his present then went
 to his house.I got him a trickshifter 
 and he got numbers up from Martin and 
 from Paul he got a bar of chocolate   
 and a photo album.When everyone was   
 ready we went to the Wimpy.Martin,    
 Andrew and I had a cheese burger and  
 chips and a coke.After we had a       
 knicker bocker glory we all went back 
 to Andrews house.We went up stairs to 
 play.After a while we went to         
 Chatsworth park to play football we   
 had a brillant time the score was 5   
 all.After all the games we had the    
 cake it had a football pitch on it    
 then we had a mars bar each and a     
 balloon to take home.
