		<content> My name is Julia McGough.I am eleven  
 years old and I go to Explorers every 
 Monday night from 06:30 to 07:30.     
 Explorers is a church youth club .It  
 is run by St John's Church,the vicar  
 is Rev. Kelly.Mrs Hewer run the club. 
 You go to Explorers from seven years  
 old until you are eleven then you go  
 to Path Finders. In Explorers you     
 learn about the Bible. There are work 
 sheets to do each night which you     
 complete at home. You learn memory    
 verses and play team games.When you   
 have been for six weeks you get a     
 badge.If you go to Church for twenty  
 weeks you get a Bible.I like Explorers
 because it takes up your Monday night 
 and it is quite good fun.
