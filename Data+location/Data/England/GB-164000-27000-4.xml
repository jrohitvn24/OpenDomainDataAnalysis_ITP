 One of the largest churches in Helston
 is St Michael's. The church has been  
 changed twice since it was built.     
 Inside the church there are forty-two 
 rows of pews made from pitch pine. It 
 has many plaques made of marble on the
 inside walls which commemorate some of
 the special people who are buried in  
 the church.                           
     The church tower is about 150 feet
 high and contains six bells. From the 
 top of the tower one may obtain a     
 spectacular view of the town of       
 Helston, Loe Pool, Loe Bar and Mounts 
 Bay. The tower bells can be heard all 
 over the town of Helston              
     The church has a massive organ and
 on the East wall is a large stained   
 glass window.
