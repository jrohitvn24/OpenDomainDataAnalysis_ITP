		<content> The survey concentrated upon the      
 shopping habits of the mothers of the 
 children in 'survey' schools.It was   
 found that Thursday was the most      
 popular day for shopping-this is also 
 market day in Stanley.At weekends many
 families went to larger towns to do   
 the bulk of their shopping.Newcastle  
 and Washington were the most          
 frequently visited towns.             
  Within the close proximity of the    
 area the large supermarkets were found
 to be much more popular than the      
 local 'corner shop'.Food and clothing 
 were the most common items purchased  
 in both the supermarket and local     
 shop.
