		<title>08NEWLAND PARK, 2.</title>
		<content> In another garden there was a yacht.  
 The gardens are so big that some of   
 the occupants have sold the side part 
 of their garden so that another house 
 could be built in the space. Even     
 these new houses are big and have     
 large gardens.                        
   The people who live in{Newland Park}
 are very rich. Just about down every  
 drive there are at least two cars.    
 They are professional people like     
 doctors and solicitors. In one of the 
 houses there is a nursery for lots of 
 young children. The houses are        
 privately owned. We think that the    
 people who live in these houses are   
 very lucky.
