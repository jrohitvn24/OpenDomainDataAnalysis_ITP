		<title>09GREYWELL AND THE CASTLE</title>
		<content> Greywell Village is situated west of  
 North Warnborough Village. The area is
 mainly rough grazing land with some   
 cultivated crops.There is a small area
 of wet and boggy land. Hockley's Farm 
 and Adam's Farm are situated on the   
 road into North Warnborough. The Alder
 Valley bus service, 201, passes       
 through this area to Basingstoke. A   
 single track lane, suitable for light 
 vehicles, leads to the Basingstoke    
 Canal, where there is a ford and a    
 swing bridge. A network of designated 
 foot-paths and tow-paths cover the    
 area. There are 84 houses in the area.
 A large, open space is used as a      
 public playing field. Odiham Castle,  
 locally called, "King John's Castle"  
 is an ancient monument, by the side   
 of the canal. The canal crosses the   
 River Whitewater using an aqueduct    
 nearby.                               </content>
