		<title>05INDUSTRY AT EASTFIELD</title>
		<content> To the south of the residential       
 housing area of Eastfield is an area  
 of light industrial development. This 
 area has grown since the 1960's and is
 still being extended. At present it   
 contains a variety of developments.   
 These include three small storage /   
 factory areas linked to the supply of 
 electrical components. One of these,  
 Faraday House, is a small factory     
 linked to Dale Electric. Dale sell    
 electrical generators throughout the  
 world. A large steel storage area     
 makes up part of the estate. Other    
 developments include a large          
 commercial vehicle testing station, a 
 large storage / service area for      
 lorries and a cash and carry. Much of 
 the activity here is linked to        
 McCain's frozen food factory. However 
 the major development on the site is  
 Plaxton's coach building firm.        </content>
