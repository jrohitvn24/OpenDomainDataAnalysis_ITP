		<title>03Farming:hops at Cradley Hall</title>
		<content>   Cradley Hall farm is run by Mr.Price
 who also manages other farms.  He     
 grows hops as his main crop and keeps 
 150 beef cattle that are bought in    
 makets in Dorset.  Mr. Price owns     
 most of his machinary including       
 specialized hop equipment.            
   The income from the hops is very    
 variable; he is already negotiating a 
 price for the 1988 crop. Mr Price has 
 a problem with the unsteady prices of 
 hops.  Last year he did not sell some 
 hops because the price was low (Â£100).
 This was due to competition from other
 countries.  He hopes to change a yard 
 of Goldings, used for lager, to       
 Challenger, used for beer.  Most of   
 his hops are taditional english       
 Fuggles.  It costs about Â£5000 per    
 hectare to replant or reestablish a   
 hop yard  and then one must wait 3    
 years for the first harvest.          </content>
