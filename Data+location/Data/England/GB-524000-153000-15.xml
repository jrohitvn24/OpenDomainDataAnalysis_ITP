		<title>15The A217 through Kingswood</title>
		<content>    The A217 forms the back-bone of    
 Kingswood and is a main, dual carriage
 way, trunk road - running from London 
 to Brighton. It was first developed   
 during Georgian times when it was used
 by up to 50 coaches per day. The      
 volume of traffic using this road now 
 is a far cry from 50 coaches per day, 
 and is something of a problem.        
    Although the speed limit through   
 the village is 40 m.p.h., it is rarely
 observed and accidents occur only too 
 often. A traffic survey, on Thursday  
 11th July 1985 between 11.50 am       
 and 12.10 pm illustrates the problem. 
  { Traffic traveling to London:       
{Cars:396 Vans:35 Lorries:80 Coaches:7.
{   Traffic traveling to Brighton:     
{Cars:393 Vans:55 Lorries:28 Coaches:10
    The hope of the locals is that when
 more of the M25 is opened (later this 
 year) the problem will ease.          </content>
