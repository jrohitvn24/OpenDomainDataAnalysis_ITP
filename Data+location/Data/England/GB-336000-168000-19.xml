		<content>   Fashion these days consists of      
 mostly bright eye-catching colours or 
 pastel shades.                        
 Boys wear tight jeans or              
 "baggies"-which are often grey and    
 faded,loose around the legs and tight 
 at the ankles. Flared trousers are not
 in fashion.Nike shoes and windcheaters
 are popular in bright colours.        
 Girls often wear pastel colours in    
 dresses,trousers and shorts.The mini  
 skirt seems to be making a come back. 
 Make up and jewelry are available in  
 all fashion colours.                  
 Shoes have gone from the pixie boot   
 style to canvas shoes in all bright   
 and pastel colours.                   
 Hair which is quite short down the    
 back but adventurous on top is        
 popular.Hair gel and coloured sprays  
 are used to get distinctive designs   
 though the "tail" seems to be fading. </content>
