		<content>  There are 2{Roman camps}on a site in 
{Metchley Park,Selly Oak.}The larger   
 fort,covering 12 acres,is thought to  
 date back to A.D.40-50.The inner fort,
 which covers 6 acres,dates back to    
 A.D.90.                               
  Excavation of the forts began in 1954
{Pottery, buckles,}and some{weapons    
 used by soldiers during Roman         
 occupation were unearthed.A metal gate
 2.3 inches thick was also found.30ft  
 to the west of the fort there is      
 evidence of a road leading to it.     
  The fort probably protected a small  
 area of{Harborne},and was occupied for
 about 100 years.All that remains today
 are a few small wooden posts joined   
 together with planks on a grass verge.
 Along the base of the verge is a      
 shallow ditch.
