		<content> Here rural chalk downland slopes north
 to the Icknield Way &amp; includes part of
 5 parishes. To the south the land     
 rises to 500ft giving way to heavy    
 clay.Here are some Therfield's houses,
 around the green,church,chapel,school,
 shop,hall &amp; pub.More people lived here
 in 1851.We have no estate building/   
 commercialism.We remain quite         
 remote.Therfield Heath is an SSI.Land 
 is carefully farmed,but useage has    
 changed.Chalklands no longer support  
 only sheep.Various cereal crops are   
 grown but now no milking cows.Few     
 trees have ever stood here.Winters are
 often harsh.Our rural community is    
 quite close_knit,sharing societies &amp;  
 clubs with Kelshall.Most residents    
 commute to work.Some old houses have  
 been well restored.Property expensive;
 new houses rarely built.It's a        
 conservation area.                    </content>
