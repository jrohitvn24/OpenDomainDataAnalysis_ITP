		<content>     The year is 1985 , my name is     
Claire Cassidy. There are a lot of     
thing to do in your spare time in      
Milton Keynes which is a good thing.You
 can go and see some pop concerts up at
the Milton Keynes Bowl.They do not have
that many groups in the Bowl but on the
last Saturday night there was a concert
held there, the main group was U2.     
     You can also go up to Willen Lake.
It is abig lake for water sports.This  
month ,July, a big new hotel has just  
been opened.Ther are also a lot of     
parks up that way.                     
     There are 3 leisure centres in    
Milton Keynes at the moment.The one    
nearest to where I live is the one at  
Bletchley.We have alovely shopping     
centre up near Central Milton Keynes.
