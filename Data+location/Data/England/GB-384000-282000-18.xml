		<title>18A Day in my life in Kinver</title>
		<content>     When I get up at 7.30 I walk over 
to the window, half asleep, half awake,
but as soon as I smell the really fresh
air I feel alive. The thing that       
catches  my attention the most is the  
birds singing and the horses eating.   
At about 8.30 I walk to school with my 
sister. As I walk past the old shops   
and houses I realise what a pretty     
village Kinver is.                     
     At last I get to school. My       
lessons seem to drag a bit but at 3.30 
I walk home with my sister. We always  
go in a really old shop and buy some   
sweets or an ice-cream. Just before we 
get home we always walk up this alley  
where there's a very old house with    
beams on it. Beside the house are rocks
with really big trees and pretty       
flowers.
