		<title>09JANE ROSSINGTON - TV STAR</title>
		<content>  I live with my husband David and my  
two children Sorrel and Harry at Wall  
Hall. We have lived here very happily  
for eight years and feel that we have  
returned to our roots, as my husband   
was born in Lichfield and I was brought
up nearby. I travel to Birmingham every
day, initially to take my children to  
school and to go on to work at Central 
TV Studios where I act in a soap opera 
"Crossroads". It is with a great sense 
of relief that I drive home in the     
evening away from the city and back to 
our small community.                   
  I can see the church clock from our  
house in the centre of the village     
and enjoy hearing its chime and our    
view the other way is over open farm   
land. The children feel safe to play   
all around the village and meet their  
friends. I feel very happy and content 
living here.                           </content>
