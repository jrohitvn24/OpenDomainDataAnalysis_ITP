		<content> The land around Roos and within our   
 block is predominantly agricultural.  
 The farming is mainly arable but some 
 farmers keep livestock,such as pigs,  
 cattle,sheep and dairy cows.The       
 farmland is dotted with small copses  
 of woodland kept by the farmers for   
 cover of wildlife,such as pheasants   
 and partridge.On the other hand many  
 hedges have been grubbed up so as to  
 increase the size of fields to        
 accomodate large machinery,such as    
 combined harvesters.                  
 The main settlement of people is in   
 the villages of{ROOS}(850 persons) and
{TUNSTALL}(less than 100 persons).Roos 
 is a typical ribbon development along 
 the main road to Hull and Withernsea. 
 Tunstall is a small group of dwellings
 (mainly farms) close to the cliff top 
 and the North Sea.
