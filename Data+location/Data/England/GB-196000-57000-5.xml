		<title>05THE CHINA CLAY INDUSTRY PT4</title>
		<content> The mining of China Clay leaves       
{large scars}on the{environment.}As an 
 open-cast operation it is visible for 
 all to see. There is a vast amount of 
 waste. For every tonne of kaolin,     
 there are 6 tonnes of quartz sand, 1  
 tonne of overburden and 1 tonne of    
 mica.                                 
 Years ago at the turn of the century, 
 men cared little about the effect of  
 the waste on the environment, and     
 waste material was dumped on tips that
 became conical in shape.Slowly        
 vegetation such as heather,ling and   
 gorse became established; old pits    
 filled with water and were dangers to 
 the local population.                 
 Today, tips are built differently. The
 law demands that overburden should be 
 separated from other waste and sand is
 dumped in stable platforms, forming   
 flat-topped hills.                    </content>
