		<content> This school is a Primary School and   
 takes children from 4 to 11. Lessons  
 are mainly Maths, English, Art, Music 
 and P.E. We have a choice of packed   
 lunch, school dinners or going home.  
 There are 3 dinner ladies and a few   
 cooks. Children do duties such as ring
 the bell and give out registers. In   
 Assembly, Tuesdays and Wednesdays we  
 have a story, hymn, prayer and        
 announcements. Thursday is a radio    
 service and Friday a Hymn practice. We
 have 2 playgrounds, 6 classrooms, a   
 staffroom, offices and teachers keep  
 exercise books in one of 3 stock      
 cupboards. School starts at 5 to 9 and
 finishes at half past 3 with 15       
 minutes playtime morning and          
 afternoon. The nurse visits our school
 checking our hair, hearing and        
 eyesight. She enjoys her work and     
 visits three schools each day.        </content>
