		<content>  As this is a rural area about half   
 the population are farmers or in some 
 way connected with agriculture. These 
 are mainly 'local' families often     
 interrelated. Some  of the rest have  
 employment in towns up to 30 mls away 
 but a large proportion have 'retired' 
 from many walks of life and so provide
 a good balance of interests and       
 skills.  This all blends together very
 well to give a very self supportive   
 community.                            
   As the Village School closed years  
 ago the younger school age children   
 are catered for in schools at Wigmore 
 (4mls) and Leominster. College        
 education is provided at Ludlow and   
 Hereford.                             
   During the Summer months the        
 population is increased by visitors   
 renting the holiday cottages some who 
 return year after year.               </content>
