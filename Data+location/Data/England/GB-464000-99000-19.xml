		<title>19A day in my life</title>
		<content>   I get up at 7:20am, wash, dress, and
 have my breakfast. Then I watch TVAM  
 (breakfast time television programme) 
 until 8:30am when I set off for       
 school.                               
   School starts at 8:50am with        
 assembly. Then we have lessons until  
 mid-day with a 15 minute break at     
 10:45am. I go home for lunch. Lessons 
 begin again at 1:15pm. We have a small
 break at 2:20pm. At 3:35pm I go home  
 and have my tea.                      
   Afterwards I play my records (I like
 Wham and Shakin' Stevens) and read my 
 pop magazines.                        
   At 7:00pm I go down and watch the   
 television or read. Then I have a     
 drink and go to bed at about 9:00pm.  
   I read in bed for about half an hour
 and then go to sleep.
