		<title>04THE CHEMICAL WORKS TODAY</title>
		<content>                                       
    Today, British Chrome and Chemicals
 is one of the World's major           
 manufacturers of a range of{chromium  
{chemicals}and is the only such plant  
 in the UK.These chemicals are used in 
 various industries eg construction,   
 plastics and rust proofing both at    
 home and overseas.                    
                                       
    The plant is in a very unusual and 
{isolated}situation away from the major
 industrial areas of Teesside. The     
 local{railway line}was one of the main
 reasons for remaining in this location
 but since British Rail changed its    
 type of wagons,{road transport}has    
 become cheaper. The local road network
 has been very much improved over      
 recent years, with the new A66 dual   
 carriageway which links to the major  
 North-South motorway, the A1(M).      </content>
