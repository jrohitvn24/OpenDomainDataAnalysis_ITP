		<content> The life style of the younger gener-  
 ation varies acccording to the circum-
 stances that surround them.  Those in 
 full-time employment tend to be more  
 orthodox, not being confronted with so
 many way-out styles.  Seasonal workers
 usually prefer evening work, leaving  
 their days free to go on the beach.   
 The "Beach Boys" dream is to ride a   
 Malibou board - and it would appear   
 that sun, sea, surf and sand are daily
 necessities.                          
 Many teenagers tend to indulge in     
 drug-taking - this is fast becoming a 
 problem in the area.  Punk dress seems
 to be the present trend; and with this
 is seen pierced ears (and noses) and  
 multi-cloured hair.                   
 Discos are popular with young people. 
 Two local groups, "Secret Agent" and  
 "Poetic Injustice", have a large      
 following at local gigs.              </content>
