		<title>19CHIEF TECH. R.A.F.WADDINGTON</title>
		<content>   The Chief Technician has worked all 
 his life in the R.A.F. but is having  
 to leave since there are too many     
 chief technicians and the R.A.F are   
 looking for younger men. He hopes to  
 get a job with the U.S. Forces in     
 Germany, though his family will remain
 at home in Waddington.                
   The Chief Technician rises at       
 6.30am, has breakfast and a cup of    
 tea, leaves at 7.00am and gets to work
 at 7.30am.                            
   He is in charge of the 5 men who    
 look after the Vulcans. During the day
 they will wash and service the two    
 planes, taking lunch between 1.00pm   
 and 1.30pm and finishing at 4.00pm.   
 Then the Chief Technician has half an 
 hour break, then locks up and returns 
 home for tea.                         
   In the evening he might read the    
 paper and then go out.                </content>
