		<content> The simulators take the form of the   
 cockpit of an aircraft and are used to
 train pilots.The visual system of the 
 simulators are now all computorised   
 ,where as they used to be done with   
 models.The visual system of a         
 simulator is all computorised.When the
 simulator moves at exactly the same   
 time.The computer is able to project  
 an image of day or night. The         
 simulator moves on six different legs 
 which are connected to three pistons  
 which moves the simulator on six axis 
 (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT and two           
 diagonals.)At Link Miles they actually
 produce classroom simulators,which are
 simulators that are literally cut in  
 half.The simulators are placed in     
 front of them so that the pupils have 
 a full view inside the cockpit.
