		<title>16Richard's Saturday</title>
		<content> On Saturday morning at 11.00 I got out
 of bed and looked out of the window.  
 It was nice so I ran down the stairs  
 and made my breakfast. After breakfast
 I got dressed and went out to play.   
 Two hours later it was dinner time. We
 had scrambled egg on toast and for    
 pudding we had cheesecake. After      
 dinner I went back outside to play on 
 my go-cart. Later, all the family went
 for a walk in the wood.We took an hour
 over the walk. When we came back it   
 was tea-time.We had sandwich spread on
 toast. After tea I went outside for   
 half an hour. I came in for a bath,and
 after my bath I watched television. At
 8pm. it was my bedtime. I read for a  
 short while before going to sleep.Then
 my big sister came to bed and woke me 
 up.                                   
                                       
                                       </content>
