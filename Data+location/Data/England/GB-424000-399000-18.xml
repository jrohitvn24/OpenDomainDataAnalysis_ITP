		<content>{A DAY IN MY LIFE}by Robert Hinchliffe 
 I woke up this morning at 7.30am and  
 got up shortly afterwards and went    
 dowmstairs to get breakfast. I had    
 cerial, toast, and orange juice. Then 
 I got ready for school, packed my     
 lunch and books in my bag. I called   
 for my friend Christopher. We arrived 
 at school just before 9am when school 
 starts. The morning work included     
 English&lt; maths and a reading session. 
 The reading session is my favourite   
 because I like books so much. Then we 
 have a school assembly where we all   
 join together and sing Hymns. We had a
 break for milk and play, followed by  
 Art/Craft till lunch time. I had a jam
 sandwich and a friut drink, then we   
 went outside to play. We have a long  
 break at lunch time, I played games   
 like hide and seek with my brother and
 my friend Gregory.    (cont)          </content>
