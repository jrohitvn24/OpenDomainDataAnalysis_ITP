		<title>15INTERVIEW WITH FISHERMAN</title>
		<content>We interviewed a retired fisherman-Mr. 
Oliver,to ask him about Cullercoats and
his lifestyle as a fisherman.Here is a 
summary of the interview.              
The working day of a fisherman varies  
depending on the aim of the catch.To   
haul crab pots you need to be up       
between 3:30 and 4:00 am and you finish
at about 12:00 pm but in summer when   
the salmon season begins he could be   
out until as late as 7:00 pm.When not  
actually fishing his time is spent     
mending nets etc.                      
When catching salmon a five inch mesh  
is used.The net is forty mesh deep     
and is drifted from East to West,and   
from North to South on a flood tide.   
The fish caught include white          
fish,lemon sole and salmon.Crabs are   
also caught.Today things that were once
done by hand are now done by mechanical
equipment.                             </content>
