		<title>15HOUSING IN THE EGMERE AREA</title>
		<content> There are few dwellings in this area. 
 There are four{tenanted farmhouses,   
{twelve tenanted houses}and{twelve tied
{cottages.}Only one dwelling has been  
 in the family more than one gener-    
 ation. The average occupation of a    
 property is 14 years. There has been  
 no recent development. The dwellings  
 are in three clusters - at Quarles, at
 Waterden and, the largest, at Egmere. 
 The cottages at Bunker's Hill are     
 notable as they were among the first  
{prefabricated buildings.}Erected for  
 servicemen at the wartime base, they  
 are single storey buildings. After the
 war, about 30{squatters}moved into the
 Nissen huts, no other housing being   
 available. Later, the huts were       
 modernised by the Council and a rent  
 of 7/6 per week charged. Most stayed  
 for six to seven years until          
 conditions became too poor.           </content>
