		<title>04A farm worker's day.</title>
		<content>   In an interview with my uncle who   
 works on a nearby farm I learned the  
 following information.                
  {Q.1. What animals do you have on the
{farm?                                 
   A.1. We have cows that are used for 
 milking purposes, pigs and sheep, that
 are used for meat and fat and hens    
 kept for their eggs.                  
  {Q.2. What are the main crops grown  
{on the farm?                          
   A.2. The main crops are barley,     
 wheat, potatoes, turnips and grass    
 (winter fodder and silage)            
{  Q.3. What is involved in your       
{typical day?                          
   A.3. Around 5 a.m. I round up the   
 cattle for milking. after the cows    
 have been milked the milking parlour  
 must be well cleaned out.             
                                       
                                       </content>
