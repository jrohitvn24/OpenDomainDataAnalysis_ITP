		<title>10**    HELEN'S BIRTHDAY    **</title>
		<content> I had a wash and as I got to the      
 bottom of the stairs I saw that the   
 postman had been. He had delivered    
 eight cards. One was from my          
 grandmother Tingle and another from my
 Grandma and Grandad Dunderdale with   
 two pounds in. The others were from my
 Aunty Janeen who is 17, Uncle Stephen 
 aged 21, Aunty Ivy sent me three      
 pounds, Uncle Len, Aunty Margaret and 
 cousin Toni, my Aunty Janeen and Uncle
 Sam and my two cousins Samantha and   
 Simon. My Grandma Tingle came at night
 and we had a barbecue tea before I    
 went to Youth Club. She gave me five  
 pounds and a box of chocolates. The   
 next Saturday I went to town and with 
 my money I bought another jumper. This
 one was cream with blue, red and green
 stripes. I had a lovely day and some  
 money left over. I didn't have a party
