		<title>17Residents Working in Whitley</title>
		<content> In the{1981}Census there were {249}   
 people of Whitley in employment of all
 kinds and in different places. In{1985
 we have found that at least forty     
 residents are still employed inWhitley
 in all kinds of jobs ranging from     
 farming to the Church; 23 of which are
 self-employed in such work as business
 consultant or casual farm worker.  We 
 have residents who work for themselves
 in garages, farms and small holdings, 
 builders, carpenters, play-school,    
 various small businesses and crafts,  
 agricultural contractors, hairdressing
 and public houses. Those who work for 
 others in the village include care-   
 takers, teachers, farm workers, paper 
 and other deliveries, gardeners and   
 glaziers.There are no longer any shops
 in the village, but as most people    
 have cars this is less of a handicap  
 than it would have been years ago.    </content>
