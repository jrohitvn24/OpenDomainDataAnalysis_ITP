		<content>  Most people go on holidays about once
 a year.  Farm workers can't go on     
 holiday at all sometimes because of   
 the milking and the farming.  Some    
 people go on holiday twice a year if  
 they're lucky.  We go on holiday once 
 a year.  We usually go on holiday in  
 Britain.  I have only been abroad once
 for a holiday.                        
   We found out where families of      
 children in this school went for their
 holidays last year.   Out of 56       
 families,  43 had a holiday.  Thirteen
 families spent their holiday abroad   
 and thirty families spent their       
 holidays in Britain.                  
   Some people like to go to the       
 seaside for their holidays.  Whilst   
 others like to go on walking holidays.
   Some children go on adventure       
 holidays without their parents and do 
 cricket, football, climbing and golf. </content>
