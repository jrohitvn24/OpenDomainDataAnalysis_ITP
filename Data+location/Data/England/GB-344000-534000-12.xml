		<title>12HUTTON ESTATE-HOUSE OPENING</title>
		<content>   Hutton-in-the-Forest, Lord          
 Inglewood's historic home, is open to 
 the public in a low-key manner from   
 May - September every Thursday, Friday
 and Sunday; parties can come any day  
 by prior arrangement, and the grounds 
 may be visited any daytime.  The      
 business is under the day to day      
 control of Mrs. R. Blake.             
   Nine rooms inside are open, which   
 contain a wide range of furnishings   
 well looked after by Mrs. J. Grant. On
 most days there are guided tours      
 every 20 minutes, and on Bank Holidays
 each each room has an attendant.      
   There is a tea room in the Cloisters
 under the Gallery.                    
   A number of local events are        
 presented at the House.  It is planned
 to increase visitor numbers from 5000 
 in 1984 towards 15000, without        
 changing the place's atmosphere.      </content>
