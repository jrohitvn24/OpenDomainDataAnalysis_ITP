		<title>05THE VILLAGE:EATON UPON TERN</title>
		<content>   Most of the people who live in the  
 village who we asked why it was called
 Eaton Upon Tern, had no idea.  Heavy  
 goods vehicals are not suposed to go  
 through the village, but when they do 
 they disturb the peace, they go       
 through by mistake mainly because they
 lose their way along the lanes and end
 up getting to the airfield through the
 village.  During the war the airfield 
 was used for all the services, now it 
 is a small part of the industry of    
 agriculture around the area, planes   
 are kept there for crop spraying.     
   Mainly retired people live in that  
 area and there is not any sociel life 
 at all.  You have to have a car really
 if you live in that area, only two    
 households have not got a car,        
 Uperton is where the nearest shop is. 
   Women who live there do not go to   
 work, instead they stay at home.      </content>
