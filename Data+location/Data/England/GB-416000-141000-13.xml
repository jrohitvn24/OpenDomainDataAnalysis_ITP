		<title>13The View from Beacon Hill</title>
		<content>   If you stand at the top of Beacon   
 Hill which is 204 metres high and look
 in a general Westerly direction you   
 can see Bulford Camp, Bulford,        
 Amesbury and Boscombe Down.           
   To the North West in the distance   
 can be seen the Seven Sisters group of
 trees.. In the Foreground is Bulford  
 Camp Sports field and a Firing Range. 
   Looking South West the Naafi        
 Warehouse can be seen and slightly to 
 the South, Boscombe Down A&amp;AEE.A      
 variety of fixed wing aircraft and    
 helicopters fly overhead, some showing
 R.A.F. roundels and colours and others
 Army.                                 
   The ground about us is covered in   
 rough grass and thistles with chalk   
 and flints showing through. There are 
 small blackthorn and gorse bushes, and
 the ground is deeply rutted where     
 heavy Army vehicles have crossed.     </content>
