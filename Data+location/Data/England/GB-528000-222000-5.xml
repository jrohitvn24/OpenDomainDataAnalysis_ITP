The TOWER is attributed to Petronilla  
(Moyne) but may date from 1235 or earl-
ier. In the Tower is housed the Ring of
Eight Bells considered by many to be   
the finest of that weight in the count-
ry. The oldest is dated 1626.They prac-
tise on Mondays and are rung regularly 
on Sundays. During the restoration of  
the Tower in 1907, several carved heads
were revealed. One of these is known as
Â£Stalin's Head',but is really a like-  
ness of a contemporary sexton.         
The history of the building stands pre-
sent for all to see and draw upon for  
their sense of belonging to time past  
as well as time present.
