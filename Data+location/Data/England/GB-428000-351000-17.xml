		<content> MOST PEOPLE TRAVEL AROUND THE AREA IN 
 PRIVATE CARS. THE ONLY WAY TO REACH   
 MANY PARTS OF THE AREA AS THE ONLY    
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT, THE BUS SERVICE FROM
 DERBY TO MATLOCK, KEEPS TO THE MAIN   
 B5023, THE OTHER ROADS BEING TOO STEEP
 OR NARROW.                            
 THE MINERAL RAILWAY IS USED LESS AND  
 LESS.                                 
 THE GPO HAVE NO RIDE WITH THE MAIL    
 FACILITY IN THIS AREA.                
 MANY LORRIES USE THE ROADS TO         
 TRANSPORT LIMESTONE. THIS IS A MAJOR  
 ISSUE IN THE AREA AS THEY CAUSE NOISE 
 AND DUST AND YET ARE MANY FAMILIES    
 SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT.
