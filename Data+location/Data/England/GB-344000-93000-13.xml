		<title>13OUR COMMUNITY POLICEMAN</title>
		<content> We interviewed our{Community Police   
{man,}P.C Wedge. We found out that he  
 gets two to three calls a day and has 
 worked as a policeman for seven       
 years.                                
                                       
{The Police Station in Bridport}is     
 forty-four years old. There are       
 twenty eight police men working at the
 Police Station. Quite recently P.C    
 Wedge has dealt with a{burglary}of    
 Â£2,600 worth of silver.               
                                       
 There are no dogs at the Bridport     
 Station, but there are five dogs in   
 the Western County. The funniest case 
 he has dealt with is when he caught a 
 missing dog and put it in the car.    
 Before he had time to take the dog to 
 the station,it jumped out of the      
 window!!
