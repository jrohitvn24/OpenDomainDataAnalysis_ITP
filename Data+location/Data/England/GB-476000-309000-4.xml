    The church is called All Saints.   
It is on the main street of Somerby.   
There is one vicar for three churches  
one at Pickwell,Burrough and Somerby,  
all the churches are about the same    
size.                                  
    There is a lay precher who comes   
around to teach us about Jews and God! 
    The Vicar does a junior church on  
a Tuesday night at five o'clock.       
    We have an organ player who is my  
nana.                                  
    We don't use the big altar we use  
use a little altar.                    
    We have had a new heater at the    
bottom of the seats.
