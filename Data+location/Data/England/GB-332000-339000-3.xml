		<content> A 67 year old pensioner, an ex-Ifton  
 coal miner, lives in a large caravan  
 called "The Mobile Home".It is        
 situated in a large garden.           
 A typical day in his life is as       
 follows: get up about 5 o'clock, drink
 a cup of tea, wash, make the bed then 
 breakfast.He then either goes to town 
 or works in the garden.               
 Gardening is his main hobby.He is a   
 very good gardener and grows flowers  
 and vegetables.He has previously been 
 on BBC Anglesey with his record crops 
 of peas, which were 10 ft 8 1/2" and  
 10 ft 4 1/2".They were so high he had 
 to extend his wooden fence for them to
 grow on.He needed a step ladder to get
 to the top of them and they grew      
 higher than his caravan.He has lots of
 old paper cuttings and photographs of 
 them.
