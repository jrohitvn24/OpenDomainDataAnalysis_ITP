		<content> Turning back to the village, the      
 opposite side is dominated by the Stag
 Public House and Restaurant, which    
 predates the mansion, below which are 
 two outlying cottages, the white one  
 being the former estate dairy and the 
 red brick one the former Home Farm,   
 now unoccupied. Up a grassy lane are  
 the remains of extensive glasshouses, 
 once some of the finest in Europe,    
 built about 1883, and also the old    
 village Septic Tank. A rambling pre-  
 estate cottage stands at the corner of
 the Green, with the small Village Hall
 opposite, built as a reading room for 
 men only, now renovated and open for  
 hire. After 2 estate cottages comes   
 Lark Rise House, once the estate      
 carpenter's shop, but built to        
 resemble a house, this is now a most  
 comfortable and attractive residence.
