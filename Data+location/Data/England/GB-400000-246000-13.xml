		<content>   This section of the river is        
 relatively unpolluted,being one of the
 prize rivers for coarse fishing:Chubb,
 Roach,Perch,Dace and Pike being among 
 fish caught.The waters are so highly  
 valued that nationwide competitions   
 are regularly held on it's banks.     
   The rivers present day usage is     
 confined to pleasure craft,with       
 marinas at both Evesham and           
 Tewkesbury.A lock at Chadbury has     
 recently been repaired by the Lower   
 Navigation Trust.                     
   The Fladbury canoe club regularly   
 uses this stretch of river for        
 training;some of it's members gaining 
 international recognition,and         
 representing Britain in the Olympics.
