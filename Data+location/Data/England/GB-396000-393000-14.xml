		<title>14MOTTRAM - Ecology</title>
		<content>     In the past the creation of       
woodland and its maintenance, the      
planting of hedges and hedgerow trees, 
was mainly in the hands of local       
landowners or enlightened farmers.     
However, since the changes in land     
ownership and the desire for high      
returns on  expensive land such        
improvements have been in the hands of 
County Councils, Local Authorities or  
Societies.                             
     In Mottram activity of this kind  
has been taken on by the local amenity 
society, who, under the supervision of 
its countryside officer were           
instrumental in creating, with the help
of some local residents and school     
children , a number of small woods and 
plantations, the largest one being     
Jubilee Wood.
