		<title>18BRANDON HALL</title>
		<content>{Brandon Hall}was originally a rectory.
 There wasn't a school so the Rector, {
{Revd. Teitelbaum}made the upstairs    
 into a school; that was over 100 years
 ago.  A few years ago{Brandon Hall}was
 abandoned; then about four years ago  
 it was bought and restored, as well as
 building another house in the front   
 grounds.  The back garden has about an
 acre of land, including a large tennis
 court.{Brandon Hall}is just up the    
 road from the school.  In {1938}a new 
 teacher from the new school visited{  
{Brandon Hall.}This is how she         
 described it:- the house had tall iron
 gates and a drive covered with moss.  
 The door was open, revealing  a       
 spotless stone floor. It had oil lamps
 and a bookcase down one side.The brass
 brightly shone in the sun. There was a
 large{Victorian Dining-room}which had 
 a table big enough for twelve people. </content>
