		<title>09]The village stocks</title>
		<content>Standing almost hidden between two huge
copper beech trees on the village green
are the old stocks.                    
These were made in the time of         
Elizabeth 1 and were designed so that  
two malefactors could be seated in them
side by side,while a further couple of 
miscreants could be held by the wrists 
in the iron clasps on the top of the   
oak upright.                           
The stocks stood for nearly 300 years  
to the south of the churchyard and in  
front of the smithy and were preserved 
in 1850 by a village carpenter and     
wheelwright.They were bought and       
re-erected as a gift from Colonel      
Lester Reid of Thorpe Mandeville,a     
member of the Sulgrave Manor Board in  
1933.
