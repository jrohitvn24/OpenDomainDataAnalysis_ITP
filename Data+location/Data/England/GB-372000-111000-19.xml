		<content>   It would appear that there has been 
 little new building in the village for
 some 20 years.                        
                                       
   There are 2 small groups of council 
 houses,{Platts Close}and{Orchard Close
 consisting of 10 and 12 houses        
 respectively.A resident said she      
 thought that about half of them were  
 now privately owned.                  
                                       
   Up the lane towards the church there
 are to fairly new bungalows and two   
 converted barns otherwise these       
 buildings have changed little since   
 the 2nd War.                          
                                       
   According to the Electoral register 
 there are some 300 adults living in   
 the area we have covered.             
                                       
                                       </content>
