		<content> My name is Ivan,&amp; my family originally
 came from{Goa.}We are{Catholics}&amp; go  
 to Sacred Heart Church. I like playing
 football,I also enjoy swimming at     
 Spence St.Baths. At home I live       
 comfortably with my mum,dad &amp; elder   
 brother Fabian. We are a very lucky   
 family. We've all been mentioned in   
 the local newspaper &amp; my brother has  
 been on television. We eat English,   
 Italian,Indian &amp; Chinese food. I don't
 like going to bed because it is boring
 upstairs. In the morning I find it    
 hard to get up so my mum has to wake  
 me. I dress,have my breakfast of      
 cornflakes &amp; toast,clean my teeth &amp;   
 leave for school at 8:30 a.m. I live  
 about one mile from school. My dad    
 works at a bank &amp; my mum works at     
 Midland Engineering.
