		<title>10A FARMER'S LIFE IN TOTLAND</title>
		<content>   Farmers wake up early in the morning
 to milk the cows.It takes about half  
 an hour to one hour to milk 12 cows.  
 After they've milked the cows they    
 have their breakfast.It's usually     
 7:15am when they have finished milking
 the cows,then they feed the hens.The  
 animals they keep are:_pigs;cows;hens;
 sheep and a sheep dog.Farmers grow    
 potatoes,wheat,sugar beet and corn.   
 Sometimes sheep catch sheepscab,that  
 is a disease caused by very tiny      
 insects.The sheep have to be put      
 through a special kind of bath every  
 now and again.The farmer is a nice    
 person who knows his work very well.  
 There are a few farms in our area.One 
 of them is Sheepwash Farm and the     
 other is Warren Farm.
