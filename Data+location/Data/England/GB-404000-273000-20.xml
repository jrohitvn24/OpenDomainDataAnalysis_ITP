		<title>20SAVING OUR COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content>  Last December,1984, we planted 60    
 trees at Beaudesert Nature Reserve    
 and two sacks of acorns!This summer we
 planted 40 native trees in our school 
 field. We made a nature reserve with  
 bog garden which has a plastic lining,
 and many  rare wild flowers.We also   
 have adopted a special area in Gorsey 
 Lane to look after. We hope people in 
 100 years time will like them{M.Green}
 We are trying to provide a wide range 
 of habitats for wild plants and       
 animals within a small area of the    
 school field,to promote the wellbeing 
 of local wild species.We have a       
 hedgerow,a ditch and we have planted  
 young trees.We have also put up two   
 bird boxes to encourage Blue Tits     
 nesting.The area will be a place where
 plant ande animal life can be studied 
 in its natural enviroment.{Silvermead}
