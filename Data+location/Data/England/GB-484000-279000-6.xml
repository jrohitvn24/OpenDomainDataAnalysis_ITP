		<title>06Memories of Kettering</title>
		<content>I interviewed Mrs Denney and these are 
some of her replies.She remembered     
England winning the World Cup in       
1966.Mini skirts were the fashion in   
the 1960's.Early in the 1960's men wore
Teddy Boy suits.Her favourite holiday  
resort is Madeira.Her best singing star
was Cliff Richard.She used to watch    
"What's My Line",but she doesn't watch 
it anymore.In the 1960's she became a  
member of the Council and in 1968 she  
became the Mayoress of Kettering.      
Twenty years ago houses were being     
built in Lynwood Close and along       
Pennine.                               
She had a car in the 1960's and used it
a lot but she also used the buses.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
