		<title>07Interview with a Resident</title>
		<content>   Mr Waldock was born in 1904.He went 
 to school on his third birthday.He    
 thinks schools gave children a better 
 education then.If children did some-  
 thing wrong they were caned on the    
 hand.                                 
   In 1917,when he was 13,Mr Waldock   
 left school.He still has his labour   
 certificate, which he was given then. 
   At that time Royston was much       
 smaller with no housing estates and   
 more fields. Mr Waldock went to work  
 for a farmer. He started work at      
 5am and finished at 6pm.He worked     
 every day of the year and earned two  
 shillings a week wages.               
   During the second World War he was  
 a Home Guard. He has never owned a    
 car,but he rode a bike and a motorbike
 His best memory is of Royston Fair,   
 his worst when he was run over in the 
 High Street and his thumb was squashed</content>
