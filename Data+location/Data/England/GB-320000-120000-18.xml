		<content> The West country activity of{Skittling
 is also a popular local custom.This is
 quite different to the game played in 
 Skittle Alleys called "Ten Pin        
 Bowling".Skittling is played at a     
 local Public House in a long alley    
 with wooden almost spherical          
 balls..unless the alley is an old one 
 in which case the balls become almost 
 cylindrical..which are rolloed against
 wooden skittles.These,on being knocked
 down are set up again by a            
{"sticker-up"}.who will be paid in cash
 or drinks at the end of the evening!  
 The evening also usually involves a   
 meal which can vary from a simple     
 buffet to an elaborate two or three   
 course meal.The game is enjoyed by a  
 variety of ages and by both sexes.    
{Wassailing}..the annual blessing of   
 cider trees is also a local custom    
 indulged by some(Taunton Cider workers</content>
