		<title>14GASTHORPE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Gasthorpe is a very small village.  At
 the centre is a telephone box and a   
 small post office.  This is surrounded
 by about twenty cottages dating from  
 c.1500 to the present day.  The older 
 cottages are mostly clay with thatched
 roofs and the newer cottages are      
 brick.  The village is extremely quiet
 and isolated.  There are no shops,    
 pubs or services.  There is a cricket 
 club on the south side of the village 
 and the clubhouse is used as a social 
 club fortnightly.  Weekly events are  
 bus services to Thetford and Bury St. 
 Edmunds, a mobile fish and chip van   
 and a mobile fruit and vegetable van. 
 A mobile library visits monthly.  Most
 residents own cars through necessity. 
 Local shops in neighbouring villages  
 are only patronised in emergencies as 
 people prefer to go to Diss or Thet-  
 ford.  Only the people change here.   </content>
