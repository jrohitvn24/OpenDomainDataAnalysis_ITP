 foundation of{Coopers' Company's      
{school}in 1536.                       
 There were originally two separate    
 schools:the Coborn school for girls   
 and the Coopers' Company's school for 
 boys.The former was founded by Prisca 
 Coborn and the latter by Nicholas     
 Gibson.                               
   The two schools amalgamated in 1974 
 when they moved from Bow to its       
 present surroundings in Upminster.The 
 new school enjoys quiet surroundings  
 on the edge of London's Green Belt.The
 school has a 20 acre sports field with
 excellent facilities for sport which  
 include a swimming pool,tennis courts,
 a gymn and a large and well appointed 
 Sports Hall.
