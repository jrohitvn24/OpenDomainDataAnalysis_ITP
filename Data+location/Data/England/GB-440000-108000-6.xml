		<title>06Land Drainage-Marchwood.</title>
		<content>   Our grid square was South of the    
 city of Southampton on the West Bank  
 of the River Test. Most of the land   
 was{reclaimed land,}but part was      
 farming land.The path we followed cut 
 across the grid square we surveyed.   
   There were no buildings at all.     
 There were quite a few pylons around  
 and towards the end of the path in the
 South West corner of our grid square  
 there were{drainage ditches}which     
 collected the water from the fields.  
 We saw a rusted old plough that was   
 probably used for farming the land    
 years ago. There must have been       
{shooting}recently because we found    
 some spent cartridges lying           
 around.They were the type that would  
 have been used with a shotgun.
