		<content> Both Walesby and Kirton are close to  
 the A1, within 10 minutes,            
 consequently a proportion of the      
 people living in the area use this    
 fact to their advantage for work      
 purposes. This also means that both   
 villages have a number of large       
 lorries running through them, this    
 affects Kirton more than Walesby as   
 the main road runs through the centre 
 of the former whereas the B6387 runs  
 to the west of Walesby. Both villages 
 have just one bus service running     
 through them, linking them both to    
 Ollerton and the nearest town with a  
 railway station, Retford.
