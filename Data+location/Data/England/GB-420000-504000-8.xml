		<content> We did a survey to find out just how  
 adults and children liked to spend    
 their spare time.                     
 Out of all the adults that we         
 interviewed, a large number said they 
 enjoyed gardening as a hobby both from
 the point of view of getting exercise 
 whilst at the same time receiving the 
 benefits of producing their own fresh 
 vegetables.                           
 A large proportion of the adults do   
 take part in various sports activities
 which improves their fitness from the 
 exercise they get and from the social 
 life these activities provide through 
 meeting and joining in with other     
 people  at  the  clubs  or  pubs      
 afterwards.                           
 A good number of adults enjoy D I Y   
 hobbies and about half enjoyed music  
 and walking but only a few admitted   
 spending much time watching television</content>
