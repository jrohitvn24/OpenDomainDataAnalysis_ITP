		<title>09PADBURY SICK BENEFIT SOCIETY</title>
		<content> Padbury Sick Benefit Society claims to
 be one of the oldest still existing. A
 rule book of 1836 has been found when 
 it was called the Padbury and         
 Hilllesden Friendly Society. Some     
 aspects of the rules were found       
 difficult to adhere to and in 1856 the
 Padbury Sick Benefit Society was      
 founded whose aims were easier to     
 achieve. The members, of whom there   
 were 90 in 1881, paid a quarterly sum 
 of 3 shillings. Money was paid out in 
 the event of illness or lameness. When
 a member died his wife or next of kin 
 was given 3 for funeral expenses. The
 society's meeting place was the "White
 Horse", now a private house. It now   
 meets at the "Blackbird". Their Feast 
 Day is on Spring Bank Holiday weekend.
 The festivities include a dinner,     
 dance, church service and a procession
 through the village.                  </content>
