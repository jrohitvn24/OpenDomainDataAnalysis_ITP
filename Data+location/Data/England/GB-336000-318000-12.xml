		<title>12DAY IN BOY'S LIFE,NESSCLIFFE</title>
		<content> I woke up and had Cornflakes for      
 breakfast.  I got dressed and went out
 to play on my bike. I went to school  
 by car.   I read and then I go into   
 the hall for hymns. Then we do work . 
 At half past ten we go out to play,   
 some of us play football.  We come    
 back to do more work.  At l2.OO we    
 have dinner in the hall.  Some people 
 have sandwiches.  Then we play outside
 again. We start afternoon school at   
 lpm and go home at 3.15pm.  When I get
 home I play with my brother.  I had my
 tea at 6 o'clock.  Then I went outside
 and played.  I watched TV and went to 
 bed at 9pm.
