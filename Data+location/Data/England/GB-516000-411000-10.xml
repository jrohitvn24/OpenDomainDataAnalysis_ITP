		<title>10The Guides</title>
		<content> Stallingborough Guides meet every     
 Tuesday at 7:15 to 8:30 in the village
 hall.There are two patrols,Swallow and
 Chaffinch.There are ten guides        
 altogether and we have one leader.At  
 guides we go for walks,play games and 
 once we did country dancing.Last week 
 we went on a five mile walk.We do a   
 lot of tracking.That is where one     
 patrol goes ahead leaving signs for   
 the other patrol to follow. One week  
 we had a tuck shop for the other      
 patrol to raise funds for our patrol. 
 Also we invite people to come and give
 us talks.We invited a blind man with  
 his guide dog to talk to us the other 
 week.Besides doing activities like    
 that we can also work for badges like 
 sewing and cooking.Some of us are     
 going to guide camp this year.I don't 
 know what it's like as I've not been.
