   Morthen is a tiny hamlet situated to
 the east of Whiston.It takes its name 
 from one of the Viking units of       
 administration,"the moorland district 
 with a common assembly".Five farms are
 closely grouped around the main       
 road,these are mixed farms;arable and 
 milk production.A tiny chapel can be  
 found here.This is dedicated to       
 St.James and is under the control of  
 the Rector of Whiston.Communion is    
 held on the first Sunday of each month
 and Evensong on every third Sunday of 
 the month.Nearby is the remains of a  
 medievil cross.Morthen Hall is a      
 beautiful example of a typical        
 Georgian style house.It was recently  
 sold for Â£80,000 and as a listed      
 building is protected for the         
 future.Many of the old outhouses have 
 been converted to private houses.     </content>
