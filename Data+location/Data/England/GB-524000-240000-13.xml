		<title>13RESIDENTIAL USE OF FARMHOUSE</title>
		<content> Pope's Farm is the name of the        
 farmhouse built by Jacob Pope in      
 1844.At that time it was 47 acres and 
 it was until recently a dairy farm.The
 farm and buildings are too small to be
 economical. It is now part of         
 Bluegates Farm. A local Doctor and his
 family live there now. Like many      
 Victorian houses they had their own   
 well.Water is pumped from a bore      
 hole.The old pump looked like a       
 converted hand pump. It is a patent   
 self oiling pump by H.L.Godwin of     
 Quenington,Glos. In emergencies water 
 can be obtained from a new pump house 
 built for irrigating pasture and beet 
 by Bluegates. It is sound insulated to
 stop the noise upsetting the          
 villagers. Before permission for an   
 old barn to be rebuilt could be       
 granted they had to promise to replace
 an old Ordnance Survey Benchmark.     </content>
