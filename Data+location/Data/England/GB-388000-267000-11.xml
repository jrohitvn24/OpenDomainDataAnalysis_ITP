		<content> Adults outnumber children by four to  
 one. This could be because most of    
 this property is to expensive for the 
 average young family. Sixteen children
 are at Independent Schools, and only  
 eleven in the state system. Most of   
 the over fives being privately        
 educated are at boarding school. Part 
 or full time further education is well
 supported. This ranges from day       
 release through universities and      
 polytechnics to local authority       
 recreational and vocational classes.  
 Thirteen people are at college,       
 polytechnic or university, and ten at 
 recreational or vocational classes.   
 The area includes one full time       
 teacher who also teaches at evening   
 classes and another who teaches       
 vocational subjects. Education appears
 important to this community, who spend
 both time and money on many aspects.  </content>
