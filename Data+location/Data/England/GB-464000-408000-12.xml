		<title>12CHILDRENS GAMES IN DUNSCROFT</title>
		<content> Apart from small versions of major    
 sports-soccer &amp; rounders, the most    
 popular games involved a ball and some
 kind of chase or hide and seek. The   
 most popular ones are 'Two baller' a  
 pure ballgame , 'Block' a pure chasing
 game, &amp; 'Sticks' which is both a ball 
 and chasing game.                     
 In sticks you need three sticks a ball
 and the minimum of two players. One   
 player has the ball and the others    
 stand out of the way. The person with 
 the ball tries to hit the sticks with 
 it,and when he does he throws the ball
 . He then has to set up the sticks    
 before another player comes with the  
 ball. If it is set up again before    
 they come back then you are on and the
 game starts all over again.
