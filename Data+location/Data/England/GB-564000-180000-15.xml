		<title>15HOUSING SOUTH OF HORNDON .</title>
		<content> The housing in the area consisted     
 mainly of detached and semi-detached  
 bungalows.The bungalows were built    
 during the inter war years.The        
 majority of the bungalows were brick  
 built with stucco (often painted)     
 covering the upper half of the        
 walls.Many bungalows were double      
 fronted and often had wooden porches  
 attached to the front door.Very few   
 bungalows appeared to have been double
 glazed.The majority of the plots were 
 rectangular with the shortest length  
 facing the road.The narrow width of   
 the frontages prevents the building of
 garages .We also noted a few large    
 houses,they were mainly brick built   
 and some had plaster covering the     
 upper half of the walls.These houses  
 often had square plots in excess of   
 half an acre.
