		<content> The people of the village depend on   
 private cars for personal transport.  
 The nearest railway station is 25     
 miles away.  There is one bus weekly  
 to Fakenham and one to Kings Lynn.    
 The latter, and Norwich, are out of   
 reach of those who do not have a car. 
 There is a taxi service, based on     
 Fakenham for those who can afford it. 
 The elderly with no car, are least    
 able to meet this cost.  They rely on 
 the goodwill of neighbours for visits 
 to Burnham Market Surgery, and        
 shopping in County towns.  A Community
 bus service, manned by volunteers, has
 started to operate in the             
 Wells-Walsingham-Fakenham area.  Each 
 amateur driver has passed a driving   
 test for a Public Service Vehicle.  It
 remains to be seen if this service    
 will be successful.
