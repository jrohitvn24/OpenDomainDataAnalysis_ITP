 estates both extend into the{S.E.}of  
 the block. Both are{conservation areas
 , Moorpool(1970) and Calthorpe(1976), 
 and consist of narrow, tree lined     
 roads{not designed for motor cars     
 (Moorpool Est. was built between      
 1908-12 without garages).             
  Most houses are{detached or          
{semi-detached},owner-occupied with    
 large gardens. They have{changed      
{little}because of the hard work of    
 trusts set up to run the estates, and 
 the residents society (Calthorpe).    
{ Shops are small}eg.Post office/grocer
 and newsagent. On the Moorpool est.   
 there is a tennis and snooker club and
 a Ladies circle and annual social     
 events are held (Garden show).{Trees  
 are being added to help add to a      
 village or garden look .All changes   
 require permission.                   </content>
