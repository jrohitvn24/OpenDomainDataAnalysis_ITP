		<title>19HIGH HILL FARM,HAYFIELD.</title>
		<content> On our farm we have mainly sheep and  
 beef cattle.We have 65 ewes for       
 breeding.We have three different      
 breeds,Welsh half-breds,Gritstones    
 and Swales.We have 98 lambs which are 
 Teeswater and Suffolks.The ewes are   
 between 2 and 5 years old and would   
 cost about Â£45 each.The lambs would   
 cost about Â£35 each.We have six       
 heifers which fatten up over Summer.We
 have forty nine and a half acres of   
 grassland which we graze.The farm     
 house was built at the turn of the    
 century and is on Hayfield Road.When  
 we go on holiday we have to get       
 someone to look after everything for  
 us.The day begins at about six-thirty 
 a.m.and ends about seven o'clock      
 p.m.although this can be earlier or   
 later at lambing time.The busiest     
 time of the year is between April and 
 June.                                 </content>
