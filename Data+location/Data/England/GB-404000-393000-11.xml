		<title>11Dairy Farming Old Glossop</title>
		<content>       {Hall Fold Farm}is situated in{ 
{Old Glossop.}The farmer owns the farm 
 and has lived there since{1947.}He has
 been a farmer all of his life.{Five}  
 people work on the farm,{three}full   
 time and{two}part-time.               
        The farm is a{hundred acres}in 
 size, and is a dairy farm. The farm   
 has{60}milk cattle,{20}young stock and
{1}bull. Equipment consists of{3}      
 tractors plus milking equipment. The  
 farmer has a dog called Bob, a cross  
 between a collie and an alsatian which
 helps round up the cattle.            
        Some fodder has to be fed to   
 the cattle since the farm has not     
 enough grazing land. Much of the land 
 to the north is rough moorland        
 grazing, and urban areas surround the 
 rest preventing expansion. For more   
 details see also the next page.
