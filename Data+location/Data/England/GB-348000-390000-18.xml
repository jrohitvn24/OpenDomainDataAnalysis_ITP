		<content> between the ages where boys and girls 
 begin to use 'extras' such as         
 deoderant sprays and talcs to improve 
 their appearances. Twelve year old    
 girls were aware of therange of sprays
 available and were quick to experiment
 with them: bos were totally           
 unconcerned at the same age, regarding
 these 'extras' as a waste of money and
 as a failure on the part of the girls!
 It is suggested that girls are exposed
 to a great deal of advertising through
 the magazines they read which         
 encourages them to buy such cosmetics.
 Boys regard it as 'wet' or effeminate 
 to use these materials-something which
 lasts into adulthood in some areas,   
 where the use of deoderants, etc, is  
 still regarded as unmanly!
