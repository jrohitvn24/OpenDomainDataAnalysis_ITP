		<content>In 1984 there were 73 baptisms, 34     
marriages and 27 funerals. There are   
three Sunday Services: Holy Communion  
at 8.30. (average attendance 30) Family
Communion at 10.30. (average attendance
120 - 200) and Evensong at 6.30.       
(average attendance 40). Parish        
activities include: Sunday School, A   
Pathfinders Group for 11 to 13 year    
olds, Scouts and Guides, A Bible Study 
and Prayer Group, Mothers' Union and a 
Young Wives Group. Other groups such as
Playgroup, Mothers and Toddlers and    
Keep Fit also use the Church Centre.   
  It costs about 33000 pounds p.a. to  
run the church. Almost half of this is 
paid to the Lichfield Diocese and about
one third is given to charities.       
Separate from the church, on the other 
side of the main road (A 34) is the    
Sutherland Mausoleum and the           
Churchyard.                            </content>
