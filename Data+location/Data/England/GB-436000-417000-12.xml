		<title>12A Rugby League Star.</title>
		<content> My dad is a car salesman. He is also a
 pofessional rugby league player. He   
 plays centre for Carlisle. The        
 greatest moment of his career was when
 he won the BBC 2 Floodlit Final for   
 Hull against Widnes in 1979. His worst
 moment was when he had a severe leg   
 injury 48 hours before the Rugby      
 League Cup Final at Wembley in 1982,  
 resulting in him being unable to play 
 and being unable to fulfil his        
 lifetimes ambition. As a youngster he 
 played for Normanton and represented  
 Yorkshire. He became a proffessional  
 at 17 for Huddersfield. To keep fit he
 has to train hard by sprinting, road  
 running and circuit training. He hopes
 to keep playing for as long as the    
 game gives him enjoyment.
