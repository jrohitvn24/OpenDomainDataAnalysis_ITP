{LAW AND ORDER                         
 There have not been a lot of big      
 offences in our area. There have been 
 some burglaries and stealing but no   
 more than petty stealing.There are    
 only passing policemen that go through
 the village, there are no policemen   
 that do daily beat duty. The village  
 policeman comes from Ringmer so he is 
 not often in Firle.
