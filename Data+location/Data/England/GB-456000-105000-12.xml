		<content>          The town is situated on the  
 old coaching route between two        
 neighbouring cities.The Red Lion was  
 famous as a coaching inn and the old  
 stables have been converted into a    
 restuarant.                           
          One of the earliest railways 
 went through the town,long before     
 Portsmouth had a railway.This was to  
 enable Queen Victoria to travel from  
 London to Gosport where she embarked  
 on a boat to the Isle of Wight and her
 beloved Osborne.Nowadays the ferries  
 run from Portsmouth to the Isle of    
 Wight for both foot passengers and    
 seperate car ferries.                 
          It takes one hour and forty  
 minutes from Fareham to Waterloo by   
 British Rail.
