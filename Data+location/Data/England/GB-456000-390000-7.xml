		<title>07Botany of Tickhill Castle</title>
		<content> Tickhill Castle is going through some 
 archaeological and historical research
 and to everyone's surprise there are a
 lot of plants that were from the      
 medieval period.A lady did quite a lot
 of research telling us how useful each
 plant could be,for example{Aarons Rod}
 has leaves which are made up of tiny  
 branched hair.This was made into wicks
 for candles.Roots of{Arum}have starch 
 inside.This was used for starching    
 ruffs which were fashionable in those 
 days.From the continent comes{Feverfew
 and it is said to cure headaches.There
 were at least 8 more plant types.These
 were used for their herbal qualities  
 before 20th.century medicines.The area
 at the top of the motte,where the     
 stone tower was,is divided off into 2m
 square sections.All the findings will 
 go onto graph paper as a recording of 
 how the plants spread.                </content>
