		<content> Yateley is fortunate to have a large  
 village green surviving from the      
 Middle Ages which is used extensively 
 for sports and the annual village May 
 Fayre. At this Fayre Maypole dancing  
 takes place. May Day garlands of      
 crossed flowerbedecked hoops hung with
 a doll representing the Virgin Mary   
 have been carried in procession, a    
 tradition dating back to the Middle   
 Ages and unique to Yateley. Other     
 customs include Beating the Bounds by 
 the Parish Clerk and there is a       
 'Tithing stone're-set in the Choir    
 Vestry of St. Peters Church. Yateley  
 has its own Mummers play mentioned in 
 the Hampshire Federation of Womens    
 Insitutes' book. Yateley has its own  
 Morris dancers.
