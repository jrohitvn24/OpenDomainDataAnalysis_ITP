		<title>14Farming in Newton and Linton</title>
		<content> Farming is the chief industry in the  
 area with twelve farms,one part of the
 Huntley and Palmer estate and one     
 owned by University College,Oxford.   
   A common pattern of farming exists. 
 The land is mainly arable,the crops   
 being barley,wheat,oil seed rape,     
 potatoes,peas and sugar beet. Grass   
 land produces crops of silage and hay.
 Calves are bought in and fed,mainly on
 an intensive system,to produce beef.  
 One farmer prefers to fatten          
 Continental breeds,as these produce   
 leaner meat.Several farmers buy in    
 ewes from Scotland and sell out part  
 of their flock with lambs,retaining   
 some.Ewes lamb indoors in February and
 March.                                
   The farms are run as family         
 businesses with a small amount of     
 employed labour.One farmer,an         
 agricultural contractor employs 5 men.</content>
