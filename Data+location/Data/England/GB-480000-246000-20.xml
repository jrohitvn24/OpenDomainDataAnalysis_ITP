		<title>20STOKE GOLDINGTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content>The school in Stoke Goldington was     
built in 1837,it is a small well built 
little building.The main part of the   
building is a long and wide hall,later 
on,other parts of the building were    
built.Twenty four children attend the  
school,the ages range from five to     
eight,from the outside looking onto the
building it looks like an old victorian
house,from the inside it looks quite   
modern.Hardly any walls can be seen    
because of all the interesting work the
children were doing.In one room there  
is a computer,television set and piano,
the playground outside is relatively   
small for twenty four children,at one  
time there were forty four children at 
school.All of the children live in the 
picturesque village of Stoke Goldington
apart from one boy who comes from the  
nearby village of Gayhurst.
