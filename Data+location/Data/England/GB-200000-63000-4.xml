		<content> A long time ago there was a high wall 
 to separate the girls and infants from
 the boys. Today the wall has gone and 
 the children play together in one     
 large playground.                     
 Last year we had some alterations. We 
 now have a good library and an office.
 Some of our new equipment was bought  
 by the{P.T.A.}We have just done a     
 Cowboy Concert for the parents. It was
 a lot of fun! We had a Cowboy Supper  
 afterwards and put straw on the floor.
 We ate sausages, potatoes and beans,  
 biscuits and coffee.                  
 Outside we have a{Rural Studies       
{Garden.}We all plant things.The       
 infants have grown sweetpeas. Class 3 
 has taken cuttings and grown trees    
 from seeds.The false acacia trees grew
 the best.Class 2 did tests to see what
 helps seeds and plants to grow.
