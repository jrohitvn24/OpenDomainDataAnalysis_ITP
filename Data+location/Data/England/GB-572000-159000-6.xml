		<content> Tourist attractions include the       
 Neolithic long barrow known as Kits   
 Coty House,one of the best known      
 Neolilthic monuments in the U.K.The   
 structure consists of four sarsens,   
 three are upright, supporting a large 
 flat capstore.Legend informs us that  
 is was formerly the home of a shepherd
 named Christopher who lived in        
 whichever side was sheltered from     
 inclement weather - a possible orgin  
 for the name.Little Kits Coty, or The 
 Countless Stones was similar to Kits  
 Coty House but is completely          
 ruined.This stone age burial chamber  
 is visited by many who try to count   
 the jumbled stones.Cage Hill,Aylesford
 was the site of a cavity in the wall  
 covered by an iron grill in which     
 offenders were held overnight.The cage
 no longer exsists but the site is     
 marked by a plaque.                   </content>
