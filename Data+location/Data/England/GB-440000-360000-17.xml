		<title>17CYCLE TRAINING IN TIBSHELF</title>
		<content> I enjoy cycling in my leisure time. My
 bike is a Grifter XL and it has got   
 three gears. I have been riding a bike
 for four years and I have just passed 
 my cycling proficiency test at school.
 When I went in for it I thought that  
 it was going to be harder than it was.
 Twelve of us from school took the     
 test. We had about 6 or 8 lessons.    
 Our bikes had to be in good condition 
 and the right size for us. We had to  
 know how to start off properly and how
 to stop safely. We had to know how to 
 turn right at a stop sign and how to  
 turn left at a halt sign. We had to   
 answer 20 questions on the Highway    
 Code and know the meaning of road     
 signs. All of us passed the test. We  
 each got a badge, a certificate and a 
 sticker for our bike to show that we  
 had passed.
