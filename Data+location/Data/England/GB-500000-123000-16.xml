		<title>16INDUSTRY - PETWORTH RURAL NE</title>
		<content> Apart from farming there are few      
 industries in this area, but as a     
 reaction against the standardisation  
 of the age there is considerable      
 nostalgia for the past, and old       
 timber-framed buildings have become a 
 commercial proposition. These are     
 bought elsewhere, and brought to this 
 district for repair, using green oak  
 from the woodland of N.E. Petworth.   
 The infill is knocked out, the frame  
 repaired, reconstructed, and each part
 numbered. Sections are re-erected on  
 the new site. A cider mill, sixty feet
 by twenty feet, was despatched by this
 firm, 'English Heritage Oak', to      
 Kansas City, America, for #40,000.    
 Next was a cottage, re-erected in     
 Horsham. In September 1985 the        
 enterprise is moving to a quarry on   
 Bognor Common, two miles south.
