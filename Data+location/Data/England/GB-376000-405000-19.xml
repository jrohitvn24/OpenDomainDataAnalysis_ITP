		<content> TAKING MY PENFRIEND FOR A TOUR OF THE 
 TOWN I WOULD FIRSTLY GO TO THE{TYTHE  
{BARN}- IT WAS USED TO STORE CROPS.LAND
 OWNERS GAVE 1/10th OF THEIR CROPS TO  
 THE CHURCH.                           
 NEXT I WOULD GO TO MY SCHOOL,CONEY    
 GREEN, A NEW SCHOOL BUILT ON THE      
 REMAINS OF A RAILWAY STATION YARD -   
 TRAIN TRACKS CAN STILL BE SEEN.       
 ANOTHER PLACE OF INTEREST IS THE 12th 
 CENTURY TOWER WHERE THE LORD LIVED    
 WELL BUT THE POOR BEGGED FOR FOOD AND 
 WORE RAGS.                            
 OTHER PLACES TO VISIT ARE THE NEW     
 BATHS AND THE MODERN SHOPPING PRECINCT
 - BUT SHOPPING IS BETTER IN           
 BURY,BOLTON AND MANCHESTER.
