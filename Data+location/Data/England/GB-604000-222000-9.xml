		<content> for 'Gulpman' and 'Jumping Jacks',    
 having nearly finished them and Chris 
 holds them for 'Daley Thompson's      
 Decathlon' and 'Breakout'. The others?
 They change so frequently - Chris     
 getting a new record and me beating it
 and vice versa - that no one really   
 knows. If I'm exhausted or cross and I
 need something fun, calming and       
 energetic, I bag the family tape      
 recorder, collect my favourite tapes  
 and take them upstairs, generally with
 a slice of cake on top. Now the roses 
 are out I'm going to candy some petals
 and put them on the next cake with    
 some sugared violets, shut my door,   
 plug it in and go crazy for about half
 an hour, finally returning downstairs 
 ready for anything, even going out    
 whule the rain pours down to bring in 
 the Basil in case lightning strikes.
