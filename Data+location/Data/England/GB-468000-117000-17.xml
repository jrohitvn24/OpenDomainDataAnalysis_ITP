		<content> The only inn in the area, the Hog's   
 Lodge has been a hostelry for         
 centuries,although the original       
 building was destroyed by fire and the
 present structure, erected on an      
 adjacent site, dates from only 1927.It
 caters for a wide range of customers  
 including businessmen during the week 
 and families especially at weekends.  
 There  is a well equipped playground  
 for children. Locally brewed ales are 
 a speciality and a varied menu is     
 offered for lunch_time and evening    
 meals,served at the bar or in the     
 spacious dining room.The recently     
 improved A3 trunk road now by_passes  
 the inn but in spite of this the trade
 has increased.It has gained the       
 reputation of being a quiet country   
 pub with an historic background.
