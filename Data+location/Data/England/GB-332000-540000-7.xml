		<title>07The history of Sebergham</title>
		<content>    It is not known for certain what   
 was the origin of the word Sebergham. 
 It seems to have been originally      
 Seavyburg, Sievyburg or Sievyhill.    
 The lack of natural drainage favoured 
 the growth of rushes or sieves and    
 perhaps hence the name.  Alternatively
 it is thought it might be a shieling  
 or shepherds summer pasture in a      
 clearing of the forest of Inglewood.  
    The forest of Inglewood was at one 
 time a royal hunting forest.  Thus    
 there are few villages within the     
 forest that stretches from Penrith to 
 Carlisle and West to Wigton.          
 Consequently farms and houses tend to 
 be scattered and isolated.            
    Sebergham, formerly known as       
 Sebergham Bridge, is one of relatively
 few villages within the confines of   
 the forest.
