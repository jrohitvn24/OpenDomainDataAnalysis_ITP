		<content> This area includes the eastern edge   
 of{Brentwood}as well as large parts of
{Shenfield}and{Hutton.}In the south is 
 part of the village of{Ingrave .      
  About a third of the total area is   
 residential. This is characterised by 
 expensive low-density housing. There  
 are 2 council estates. The main       
 commercial and shopping area is close 
 to Shenfield Station. Many people work
 in London and commute from here.      
  There are a considerable number of   
 recreational facilities, private and  
 public, as well as several patches of 
 woodland (some like Hart's wood and   
 Shenfield Common for public           
 enjoyment). Just under half the area  
 is farmland, the vast majority being  
 arable, growing cereals.
