		<content> THE LOCAL D.H.S.S. OFFICE             
 The Department of Health and Social   
 Security Benefit Office, opposite     
 Christ The King school, deals with    
 unemployment benefit. The office opens
 for the public from Monday to Friday  
 at 9.00 am till 3.30 pm. Twenty six   
 people work here. They have to sort   
 out how much money to give people who 
 are unemployed. This office deals with
 2800 claims every two weeks. The      
 number of claims at this office has   
 doubled since 1981 because there are  
 so many more people out of work now.  
 The building is only like a wooden hut
 with an extra mobile unit at the side.
 It was built in 1930 and was a "soup  
 kitchen". This office covers the whole
 of the Walkden area. The unemployed do
 not usually collect their benefit from
 this office unless there is a postal  
 strike.                               </content>
