		<content> bag.Having said goodbye to my parents 
 I set off on my bike for school.I     
 arrive at school at about 8.55 for    
 five minutes play before the bell     
 rings.After the first{lesson}we go out
 to play for fifteen minutes during    
 which time I eat my candy sticks.After
 playtime we have a story and then do a
 bit of science until{dinner}time.After
 lunch we do our Domesday project.We   
 have an afternoon break after which we
 listen to a story such as The Silver  
 Sword.At{hometime}I sometimes go to my
 friend Becky's house and walk back to 
 my house across the fields with her   
 after she has got changed.We go down  
 to the playing fields until 5.30 when 
 I go home for my tea and watch        
 television until 9.30 when I have to  
 go to{bed.
