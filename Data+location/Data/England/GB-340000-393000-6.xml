		<content>    Until 1972 Croxteth Hall and       
 Country Park belonged to the Earl of  
 Sefton.   The last Earl died in 1972, 
 and left no-one to inherit it.   535  
 acres of his estate became Croxteth   
 Country Park and the remainder was    
 sold for housing development.         
    One small section was taken over by
 a TV company to make the regular      
 series called 'Brookside', shown twice
 a week on Channel 4.                  
    Croxteth Hall, Walled Gardens, and 
 Rare Breeds Farm are open to the      
 public all year round, as well as the 
 200 acres of woodland, 300 acres of   
 grassland, and 40 acres of gardens    
 that altogether make up Croxteth      
 Country Park.                         
    Altogether they make a superb place
 to enjoy a day out, with plenty of    
 things to do for parents and children.
