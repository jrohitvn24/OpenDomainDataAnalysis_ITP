		<title>06FAIR OAK SCHOOL COMPLEX</title>
		<content>    Fair Oak must be rather unique as  
 far as the organisation of it's       
 schools is concerned for on the one   
 campus we have the facility for       
 children to attend a pre-school play  
 group, an infant school from 5-7, a   
 junior school from 7-11 and a         
 secondary school from 11-16.          
    In all there are nearly 2000       
 children pursuing their various       
 educational needs on this very busy   
 school site.                          
    Children over the age of 16 who    
 wish to continue their full-time      
 education go into Eastleigh to attend 
 the Barton Peveril College of Further 
 Education.                            
    In addition to catering for the    
 needs of Fair Oak children, children  
 from Horton Heath and some from       
 Bishopstoke attend the Infant and     
 Junior schools.                       </content>
