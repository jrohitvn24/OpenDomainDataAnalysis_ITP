		<title>04The Local Shop</title>
		<content> sells{convenience foods}such as tinned
 beans, tinned soups,fish-fingers etc. 
 They also sell{frozen foods}like chips
 and peas, which are in a big freezer  
 by the window. The man who owns and   
 runs the shop wanted to work there    
 because he was tired of working for a 
 large firm.{The people of Kirkby buy  
{more food to prepare than they buy    
{convenience foods.}Sometimes people   
 ask the shopkeeper for things he does 
 not stock, like some vegetables, such 
 as cauliflowers, because they go bad  
 too easily. The shop sells farm       
 produce; from local farmers he gets   
 potatoes.                             
          The shopkeeper himself buys  
 his food partly from his own shop and 
 partly from Barrow and Ulverston.{The 
{shop is very popular because it is the
{only shop in Kirkby.                  
                                       </content>
