		<content> IN THE LESSONS;SOMETIMES WE DRAW AND  
 SOMETIMES WE WRITE.AFTER THAT COMES   
 FRENCH:OCCASIONALLY WE HAVE VOCAB.    
 TESTS,OR WE MIGHT BE READING OUR      
 BONJOUR MAGAZINES.I'M OFTEN BORED WHEN
 MR. GUEST TALKS ABOUT 'ER' VERBS.     
 BREAK FOLLOWS AND WE'RE OFF TO THE    
 PORCH FOR MILK AND BISCUITS.IN THE    
 SUMMER WE PRACTISE ROUNDERS AT        
 BREAK IN THE WINTER NETBALL OR HOCKEY.
 THE WHISTLE REMINDS ME IT'S           
 ENGLISH.SPELLING LISTS ARE TESTED ON  
 SATURDAYS:THEN MRS. ASTRIDGE READS TO 
 US.SCIENCE FOLLOWS-MANY EXPERIMENTS   
 THAT ARE AWFULLY GOOD FUN.LUNCH       
 FOLLOWS,AND SOMETIMES IT TASTES       
 HORRIBLE!THE TIME GOES SO QUICKLY,    
 THOUGH,THAT IT SEEMS LIKE TEN MINUTES 
 LATER IT IS REST.                     
 AFTER READING OUR BOOKS WE COME TO    
 GAMES.GAMES TIMES ARE GOOD FUN BECAUSE
 WE PLAY ROUNDERS OR DO ATHLETICS.     </content>
