		<content>We couldn't let the opportunity pass   
without telling you something about our
recreational activities. There is quite
a lot you can do in the countryside    
that you can't do in built up areas. We
conducted a survey of all the pupils at
our school to discover children's      
favourite activities. We stressed the  
word ACTIVITY and we did not allow     
responses such as watching TV, playing 
video games etc.                       
Many pastimes are outdoor activities.  
Quite a lot of us have different       
favourite sporting activities; we have 
grouped all these under one heading of 
"Sport". The results are as follows:-  
Swimming 24%  Sport 22%  Cycling 20%   
Walking 16%  Fishing 11% Ornithology 7%
 One reason that swimming is so popular
is because the school PTA have two     
swimming sessions per week at the local
secondary school pool. Many of us go!  </content>
