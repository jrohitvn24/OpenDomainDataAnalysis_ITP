		<content>    The grassland is not highly        
 productive and the family earn their  
 living from the arable land.The       
 farmer tries to keep it as near to    
 nature as possible.                   
   A brook was dammed in 1964 to form a
 small lake.The lake is kept at a      
 certain level to give the land a      
 chance to drain.The steep banks are   
 terraced to prevent the banks         
 crumbling. The water level falls in a 
 dry season.In the valley there is a   
 Hydraulic Ram by which water is sent  
 via the pump-house to the farmhouse.  
   The farmer hopes that the farm will 
 remain as non-intensively farmed as   
 possible.He enjoys walking by the lake
 and admiring the bluebells on a       
 Saturday evening.                     
   The hills are used for tobogganing  
 in the Winter.
