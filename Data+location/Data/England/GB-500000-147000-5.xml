		<title>05Tillingbourne Trout Farm p1</title>
		<content> The trout farm in Chilworth is a      
 thriving business with three full time
 workers.                              
                                       
 The day at the trout farm begins with 
 "letting the tanks down". This process
 reduces the amount of water in each   
 tank so the fish are more easily      
 caught. The shop is then opened.      
 Customers range from local people     
 buying small quantities to hotels and 
 large caterers.                       
                                       
 Once a day the fish are fed with food 
 bought from the mill next door. The   
 food is in pellet form and contains   
 all the necessary nutrients needed by 
 the fish, especially protein. The     
 fully-grown fish are soaked in brine  
 overnight and then put in the electric
 smoker.                               
                                       </content>
