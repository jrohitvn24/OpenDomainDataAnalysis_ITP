		<title>12SOUTH OTTERINGTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> South Otterington originally grew     
 around the road from Northallerton to 
 Ripon.It is called ribbon Development.
 A few years ago a modern estate was   
 built to one side of the village.     
  In the village is a garage that sells
 petrol,cars and does car maintenance. 
 The manager is Mr. Raine,and the      
 garage is always very busy.The most   
 important car they have had in was a  
 Bentley.The most expensive car was    
 Â£14,000 and the fastest car went 145  
 miles to the hour.In one year the     
 garage sold 75,000 gallons of petrol. 
 There is one bus in the morning and   
 bus at the end of the working day.    
 There is no shop,no post_office but   
 there is a public house and a rather  
 beautiful old church.A few years ago  
 there was a post_office and a house is
 still called after it.
