		<title>04CASTLE AS TOURIST ATTRACTION</title>
		<content> Of those visiting the castle, we found
 that about 47% knew about the castle  
 for themselves, and that about 39% had
 found out from a relative or friend.  
 The remaining 14% found out about it  
 through other means eg from local     
 guide books or by having seen the     
 castle from a distance and then       
 wishing to visit it one day.          
 Everybody we interviewed who were     
 visiting the castle said they were    
 impressed with it.  A large number of 
 them found it very interesting and    
 others thought it was a marvellous    
 place.  Quite a few thought it was    
 picturesque.  All of them said that   
 they would recommend others to go     
 there.
