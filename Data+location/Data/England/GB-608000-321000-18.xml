		<content> There are lots of places where people 
 can play games in Reepham.The most    
 popular organised games are Football, 
 Cricket,and Hockey. Nearly all the    
 people we asked needed special        
 equipment. It is provided mostly by   
 the school and family.Boys and girls  
 in our class like to play running     
 games like Dot to Dot and Double      
 Tag.Groups of about twenty to thirty  
 people play these games.Not many      
 people play by themselves.On certain  
 nights if you go to the High School   
 there are organised games.You can play
 Squash at the Brewery House.In the    
 holidays people sometimes play        
 computer games.If its snowy they play 
 snowball fights and play on thier     
 sledges,going down slopes.My favourite
 games are Football,Cricket,and Hockey.
 I play them about once a week.
