		<content> Disappointing though it was, apparent-
 ly the area contains very few{ghosts, 
 and the ones which do exist seem to be
 friendly.There is only one ghost story
 we have been told,and the ghost was   
 seen at{Brogyntyn Hall.}A man was     
 walking through a nearby tunnel and he
 just happened to look behind him,     
 where he saw a{grey lady}beckoning to 
 him.He then carried on walking and    
 later looked back to see the woman    
 still following. He later heard that  
 it was probably the ghost of a woman  
 who drowned several years before      
 nearby. Brogyntyn is just the place   
 for a ghost!                          
    Our work is now complete! Victoria,
 Ruth, Bella, Amber, Caroline, Hannah, 
 Kate and Helen are back{Moreton Hall. 
{It may}have been a wet Summer but     
 those days up in the border hills will
 be unforgettable!                     </content>
