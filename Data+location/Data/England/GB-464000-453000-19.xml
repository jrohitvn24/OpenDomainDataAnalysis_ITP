		<title>19CHURCHES AND RELIGION</title>
		<content>         Religion has always played an 
 important part in the lives of the    
 villagers of Stockton on Forest,      
 Warthill and Holtby.                  
       In the Domesday Book of 1086    
 Count Alan held three caractures of   
 waste land in Stochetun whilst three  
 more caractures belonged to the Canons
 of St.Peter(The church on the site of 
 present day York Minster).            
       In the reign of King Henry ll   
 the Manor of Holtby had to pay an     
 annual pension of 25 shillings to the 
 Prior of Durham.                      
       Each of these three villages has
 had churches or chapels since those   
 days,but all the existing buildings   
 are relatively recent.                
      Holy Trinity at Stockton dates   
 only from 1895.St. Mary's, Warthill   
 dates from 1873 and Holtby church was 
 rebuilt in 1881.                      </content>
