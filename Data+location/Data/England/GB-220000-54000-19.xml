  On Saturday Daniel called for me at  
 10a.m and we watched 'Dracula' which I
 had videoed the previous              
 night.Christopher Lee played Dracula  
 as usual and he was very good.When it 
 was over we went to the field where   
 there were a lot of 'emmets'so we     
 didn't stay long.                     
  In the afternoon there was little to 
 do and I was bored,but in the evening 
 we went sea fishing at Talland.I      
 didn't catch anything but I had a bite
 or two.In the struggle after a bite,I 
 lost my float which made me very      
 cross.We were using frozen sand eels  
 for bait which quickly defrost in the 
 sun.                                  
  By the time we got home it was 10    
 o'clock.I watched another T.V         
 programme- 'Give us a Break'-before   
 going to bed.I had had a good day.    </content>
