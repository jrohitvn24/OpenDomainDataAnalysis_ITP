		<title>16  CRAFTS IN STUBHAMPTON AREA</title>
		<content> Hurdle making is one of the main      
 crafts,now drastically reduced        
 today as sheep are no longer          
 folded.Hurdles are made from Hazel    
 coppice cut every 8-10 years,which    
 being long grained is easily split and
 twisted.Hurdles are sold for fencing  
 to garden centres. Hazle wood is also 
 used for pea sticking,bean sticks and 
 spars for thatching.  Strings for bows
 are made using original spinner and   
 machinery. The strings are in demand  
 throughout the year and are made of   
 Dacron or Kevlam,the latter being     
 stronger will not stretch.   There is 
 a cabinet maker who acquires old      
 unwanted furniture and uses it to     
 reproduce period pieces of chippendale
 and also restore antique furniture.   
 Restoration of china and glass and    
 Gesso work is also carried out.
