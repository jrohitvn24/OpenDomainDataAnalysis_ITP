		<content>1.Lace making.                         
   One of our dinner ladies teaches us 
lace making.It is hard at first.Boys   
and girls should make lace because it  
is not babyish for boys to do it.It is 
hard work to do lace.We should continue
old crafts because if we did not they  
would come to an end.That would be sad 
because they have been going for       
hundreds of years.My friends agree with
me.                                    
2.Gloving.                             
   Gloving is a craft to make gloves.  
In Leafield there are 18 people who    
make gloves.Our dinner lady said that  
she earns 1 pound for making a pair of 
lambs wool gloves and 85p for a making 
a pair of leather gloves. She has been 
making gloves for 28 years . It is     
important that we learn about glove    
making because in a few years time it  
might be forgotten.                    </content>
