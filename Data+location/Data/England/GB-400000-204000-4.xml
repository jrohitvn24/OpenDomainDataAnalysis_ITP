		<title>04THE A435 CHELTENHAM ROAD.</title>
		<content> The A435 Cheltenham road has 2 lanes  
 and a speed limit of 60mph. There are 
 a lot of corners so there is not much 
 room for over taking. There are no    
 traffic lights or pedestrian crossings
 because few people live in the area   
 and there are no major junctions. The 
 A435 is a busy road as it is the main 
 link between Cheltenham and           
 Cirencester. There are 2 petrol       
 stations along the route,both sell    
 used cars.  The road is fairly flat   
 but the surface is rather rough. There
 are no street lamps,but many trees    
 over hang the road and are brushed by 
 large vehicles.
