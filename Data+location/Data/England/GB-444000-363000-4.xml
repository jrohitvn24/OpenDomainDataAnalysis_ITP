		<title>04FARMING IN HARDWICK</title>
		<content>  Farming is obviously a dominant      
 feature of this area, as indicated by 
 the vast amount of{grassland}and      
{crops.}Many of the farms are{family   
{concerns}but are now{larger}in size   
 than in the past, as dictated by the  
 need to be efficient. The increase in 
 the amount of land per farm obviously 
 means that some farmhouses are made   
 "redundant". In the village of        
{Hardstoft}part of one such house had  
 been converted into a{lighting        
{equipment firm.                       
  The techniques used are obviously    
 modern and it was interesting to note 
 that several families, although from  
 farming stock, had chosen to spend    
 time training at{agricultural college.
  The main produce was{cereal crops}and
 many farms had{cattle}for{dairy       
 produce and{beef. Sheep}were also a   
 common asset.                         </content>
