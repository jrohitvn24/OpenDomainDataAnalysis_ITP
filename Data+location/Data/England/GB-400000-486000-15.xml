		<title>15AN ELDERLY PERSON, THORALBY</title>
		<content> Mary is a pensioner who has lived in  
 Bishopdale almost all her life. She   
 was married to a farmer in 1933 and   
 went to live in a remote farmhouse,   
 Gayle Ing, outside Thoralby. She moved
 into her present home in 1955 and has 
 lived there alone since her husband   
 died in 1969.  Mary has two daughters 
 and four grandchildren who all live in
 the village. She lives next door to   
 one daughter and her family. Mary     
 cannot drive and she walks everywhere 
 if possible. There is no bus service  
 so that she has to depend on lifts    
 from her family to go any distance.   
 She can get most things and her       
 pension from the local Post Office.   
 She says it would be worrying for     
 elderly people if the Post Office     
 were to close.
