		<content>     Elderly people living between     
 Ashford Hill and Kingsclere have seen 
 many changes but comment that the     
 scenery has not altered noticably in  
 their lifetimes. Horses which once    
 worked the farms disappeared but have 
 come back in large numbers to cater   
 for riding. Old cottages have been    
 demolished in Union Lane and not      
 replaced but new bungalows have been  
 built.A small light industrial site is
 planned at the Kingsclere end near a  
 roundabout constructed where the      
 by-pass begins. The by-pass has       
 relieved Kingsclere Village of heavy  
 traffic but spoilt the peace and quiet
 for others living nearby.
