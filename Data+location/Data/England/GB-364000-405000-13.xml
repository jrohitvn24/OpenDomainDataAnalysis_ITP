		<title>13THE WORK OF A COALMAN</title>
		<content>                                       
 The{coalman}delivers coal on a        
 lorry.The tools of his trade are      
 shovels and bricks,which are used to  
 weight the sacks down to prevent them 
 blowing off the lorry.                
    The main{advantages}of the job are 
 that the work is{outdoors}and the{    
{wages}are good.                       
    The{disadvantages}are that the     
 coalman very often suffers from{      
{back-trouble}due to the stooping,and  
 the carrying of {heavy  weights}.It   
 can also be very unpleasant in bad    
 weather.                              
    As the coalman is{self-employed},he
 sometimes has bad debts,which means   
 that the customer cannot afford to pay
 for the coal,and therefore the coalman
 has less wages.                       
                                       
                                       </content>
