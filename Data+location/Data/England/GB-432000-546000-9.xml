		<content>      This is a busy place. During our 
 visit four men, eleven women, four    
 children and twenty four{old-age      
{pensioners}were served. This office   
 was opened in 1926 and there have been
{four postmasters.}The postmaster now  
 is Mr.Bailey, he used to work in the  
 shipyards. He is helped in the shop by
 his wife and one part-time assistant. 
      Stamps are the best-selling item.
 Over{two hundred pensioners}a week use
 the post-office and also buy their    
 food there.
