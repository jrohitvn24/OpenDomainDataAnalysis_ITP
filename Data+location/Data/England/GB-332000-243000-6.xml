		<content> About half the population in the area 
 is engaged in farming and there is    
 very little employment other than     
 this. Other people have employment or 
 business in Hereford, Hay-on-Wye, or  
 in neighbouring villages, but there   
 are no job prospects for young people 
 in the area unless they belong to     
 farming families. There is also a high
 proportion of retired people in the   
 area, some of whom formerly worked in 
 the area, but many who have come here 
 from the cities. The latter have very 
 varied backgrounds, which include such
 fields as business, education,        
 medicine, and science. Some have had  
 periods of residence abroad. There are
 also a few self-employed craftsmen,   
 chiefly connected with the building   
 trade.                                
                                       
                                       </content>
