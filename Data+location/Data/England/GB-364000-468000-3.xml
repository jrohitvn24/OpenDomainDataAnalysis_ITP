		<title>03A SCHOOL YEAR IN BENTHAM</title>
		<content> This is an account of my school year  
 and what I do. January and February   
 are quiet months at school. In March  
 the teachers interview our parents    
 about our work. April is the month for
 the Easter holidays. During May it is 
 Open Night when our parents come to   
 see our work. In June, on Tuesdays, we
 go swimming to Ingleton pool. Two     
 major things happen in July, there is 
 Sports Day and we visit Ingleton      
 Middle School. In September we go to  
 our new classes and during October we 
 have our photographs taken and have a 
 Harvest Festival. We rehearse for our 
 Christmas concert in November and     
 December. Late in the term there are  
 Christmas parties and a dinner.       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
