		<title>17RELIGION IN TIDWORTH</title>
		<content>  The majority of people in the area   
 are Church of England (CofE),but only 
 a small percentage attend church regu-
 larly. The remainder are a mixture of 
 various denominations including Roman 
 Catholics (RC) most of whom practise  
 their faith. There are four churches  
 in Tidworth, St. Michael's Garrison   
 Church (CofE), St. Patrick's and St.  
 George's Garrison Church (RC), St.    
 Andrew's and St. Mark's Garrison      
 Church (Church of Scotland,Methodist  
 and Free Churches) and Holy Trinity   
 (CofE). There is also St. Mary's,South
 Tidworth,built in l879,which although 
 consecrated is only used for special  
 occasions and is maintained by the    
 Redundant Churches Fund. A Mortuary   
 Chapel,built l870,although still con- 
 secrated is not now used,the adjoining
 graveyard is still used. There are no 
 Oriental or Jewish places of worship. </content>
