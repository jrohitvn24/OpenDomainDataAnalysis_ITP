		<title>06Shopping in Tetsworth</title>
		<content>Once there were many different shops   
and five public houses in Tetsworth.   
Gradually they closed until there      
were only 2 shops and 2 pubs left. The 
butcher's shop closed down in 1983 and 
last shop closed this year when the    
shopkeeper retired. We found out that  
many villagers are affected by the     
closing of the shop. Our parents have  
transport and shop elsewhere so are    
only affected a little. We can get     
sweets and drinks from the Post        
Office.For the people who do not have  
their own transport there are buses    
running to the nearest towns. Every    
Wednesday a lorry comes at which       
people can shop because it's a         
grocer's shop on wheels. We think the  
village should have a shop for the     
people without transport and for the   
old people who use it as a meeting     
place and somewhere to have a chat.    </content>
