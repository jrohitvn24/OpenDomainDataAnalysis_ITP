		<content>  During the 1930's many people were   
 unemployed so {Pawn shops}were used a 
 lot. The grandfather of 'John Kenyons'
 the gents outfitters had a pawn shop  
 on John St.                           
                                       
 Up Bell Lane was the{Star picture     
{house}near St.Paul's Bell School.     
 Pearl White was a star attraction     
 along with Mary Pickford. Cigarettes  
 were 2d(1p) for 5 Woodbines. Chips    
 were 1d(0.4p) and fish at 2d(1p).     
                                       
 We used to travel on steam trains and 
 often used the trams which used to run
 up Walmersley Rd.                     
                                       
 A neighbour, Mrs Holt, aged 93        
 (b.1892) could remember the days when 
 folk used to get on their hands and   
 knees and scrub the streets and       
 tramlines.                            </content>
