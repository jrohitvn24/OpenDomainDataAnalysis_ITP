 pictures of the characters of the     
 programme.                            
 Next we went to the graveyard,which is
 near the institute and the pub,up the 
 path next to the church.there were    
 about 80 graves.The newest was 1984   
 and the oldest 1901,where the man     
 concerned had died at sea.The church  
 was founded in 1776.It was built of   
 stone with stained glass windows.The  
 stone was beautifully carved.The      
 grounds of the church were overgrown  
 but some of the graves were well kept 
 by their families.Most of the graves  
 were from the turn of the century     
 around 1905 but some were more recent.
 Some graves could hardly be seen      
 because the grass was so high.Most of 
 the stones were eroded,making it      
 difficult to read them.The ages at    
 death varied from 96 to a few months. </content>
