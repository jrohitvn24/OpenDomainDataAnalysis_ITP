		<content> There are several clubs and societies 
 in the area some of which are well    
 established and very important to the 
 social life of the village.           
 The working men's club occupies what  
 was the Reading Room erected in 1892  
 to replace an inadequate room in a    
 cottage on Blacksmith's Hill.It was   
 used by the sporting clubs for meeting
 and changing until the whole village  
 combined to raise money for a pavilion
 on the existing playing field. This is
 run by the Westbury Sports &amp; Social   
 Committee which incorporates the      
 Cricket and Soccer Clubs.They organise
 not only their own sports but many    
 other events and entertainments.      
 The P.T.A.of the first school also run
 events.There is a W.I.,an Evergreen   
 Club and an Arts &amp; Craft Club.Darts   
 are played at the Pavilion and the    
 Reindeer Inn each week in winter.     </content>
