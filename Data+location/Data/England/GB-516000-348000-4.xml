		<content>  Dutch Elm disease killed many trees. 
 Our wood is being replenished, and    
 local farmers have planted 6000 trees.
 Daffodil bulbs have also been planted 
 on the river bank, below the footpath.
  Climate is influenced by The Wash and
 flatness of the land. We get cold east
 winds, sea mists and moderate snow,   
 usually at the end of January. In 1985
 spring was cold, summer dull &amp; very   
 wet, October warm, sunny &amp; very dry.  
  Rabbits are few due to myxamatosis,  
 but hares thrive. Pheasants are reared
 on farms, for the shooting season.    
  There are some grey squirrels. Birds 
 of prey are increasing:- Tawny, Barn &amp;
 Little Owls, Kestrels, Marsh Harriers,
 and this year a Hobby was seen.       
  The diminishing hedgerows and dykes, 
 and the use of chemicals on the       
 land, are causing concern with regard 
 to the effect upon wildlife.          </content>
