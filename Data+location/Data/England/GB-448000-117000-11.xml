		<title>11THE ORIGIN OF FAIR OAK</title>
		<content>    The village stands at the junction 
 of roads from Eastleigh, Botley and   
 Winchester. At this road junction was 
 an old oak tree and it was around this
 tree that a village fair used to be   
 held. That is how the place got it's  
 name.                                 
    It was once the custom for the     
 first stall-holder to erect his stall 
 to call at The Old George Inn. He had 
 to knock at the side door and ask the 
 landlord, Mr. White for the key of the
 fair. Then all the stall-holders would
 take the key to the front door and    
 exchange it for a gallon of ale.      
    The key, The Old George and an oak 
 tree are still in existence but the   
 fair is no longer held. The present   
 tree is about 90 years old and        
 replaces a tree thought to have been  
 pushed down on July 27th 1842 when it 
 was about 150 years old.              </content>
