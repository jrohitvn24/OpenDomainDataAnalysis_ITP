		<content>    The children in this remote area   
 use the same school system as other   
 children. The journey to school,      
 though, takes various forms. The only 
 child attending school from this area 
 is transported to the Primary School  
 by taxi. The cost is borne by the     
 Education Authority. If possible,     
 though, children generally use the    
 School Coach which picks them up at a 
 convenient point and returns at the   
 end of the school day.Alternatively, a
 parent transports children in their   
 own private cars. Having attended     
 the Village Primary/Junior School     
 until the age of 11 years they then go
 to the Comprehensive School in the    
 local town. Some wealthier parents    
 choose private education for their    
 children and in these instances they  
 stay at a boarding school.
