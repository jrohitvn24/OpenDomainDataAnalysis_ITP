		<title>05Education within Wareham</title>
		<content> The{County of Dorset}organises a three
 tier education system.  Children begin
 school at four and a half and stay in 
 a First School until they are nine.  {
{Lady St. Mary is our School.} We share
 a site with the Wareham Middle School.
 This school accepts children from the 
 age of 9+ until l3.  Because of the   
 nature of the area several first      
 schools feed Wareham M.S.  All        
 children from Middle Schools locally  
 go on to the Purbeck Upper School.    
 This school has in the region of 1,600
 children as opposed to Lady St. Mary  
 which has{200.}  Once the children    
 leave their First School,most of them 
 have to{catch a bus}each day.         
 The Purbeck Upper School has to serve 
 an area of approx. 400 sq. kilometres.
 This makes the laying on of transport 
 and the cost important factors in the 
 local authorities education planning. </content>
