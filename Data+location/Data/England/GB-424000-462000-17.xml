		<content> In 1977 to celebrate the Royal Jubilee
 it was decided to hold a teaparty and 
 sports day for all the Parish.  Money 
 raising schemes were organised to pay 
 for the food and prizes.  This was a  
 great success and as there was some   
 money left over the villages repeated 
 the event in the following year. One  
 of the Church Holy days is on the     
 Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul on    
 29th June and traditionally it had    
 been called "Thornton Feast". It was  
 decided to hold the Sports on the     
 nearest Saturday to this date every   
 year. Everybody has a great time      
 running races and taking part in all  
 the events such as Lucky Dip,         
 Treasure Hunt, Tug-of-war, Slippery   
 Pole, Trampoline, Decorated Bicycle,  
 B.M.X. bicycle course and Pram Race.  
 The ladies provide home-made          
 sandwiches and cakes for all.         </content>
