 Helmdon. The corner of Sulgrave       
 contains the Washingtons' manor-house 
 and a loop of scattered houses.       
 Helmdon slants across its valley, a   
 mixture of its own fine grey          
 limestone, imported and manufactured  
 stone and brick. Only a few of its    
 700-odd prople work here, in farming, 
 trade, small industries and building. 
 Pasture overlies quarries and two     
 railway lines which cross at a        
 viaduct.The tove rises just to the    
 north-west and is jointed by Helmdon's
 brook just to the east. Their valleys 
 lie 360 to 550 feet above sea level.  
 The soil is heavy and fertile, over

 growing barley, wheat, rape and grass,
 and feeding dairy and beef cattle and 
 sheep. Though some fields have been   
 jointed, the landscape remains        </content>
