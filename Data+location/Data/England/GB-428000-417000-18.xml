		<content> JUNK FOOD:Junk food originated in     
 America but is becoming popular in    
 Britain.It is considered unhealthy    
 because of it's high fat and/or sugar 
 content.Junk food includes hamburgers 
 and hot dogs.A hamburger is a round   
 minced meat pattie in a round bun.A   
 hot dog is a meat sausage in a long   
 bread bun.Both the meat pattie and    
 the sausage have cereal added because 
 this is cheaper than meat.            
 SUNDAY LUNCH:Sunday lunch is the main 
 family meal of the week.We have       
 Yorkshire puddings;roast potatoes;new 
 potatoes;peas;carrots;and roast beef  
 or lamb.Sometimes my Mum makes an     
 apple pie,which we have with custard. 
 TAKE-AWAYS:Two of my favourite meals  
 are fish and chips,bought ready cooked
 from Mick's fish shop in Queen Street 
 and Chinese food,bought from the Lucky
 Flower take-away in the High Street.  </content>
