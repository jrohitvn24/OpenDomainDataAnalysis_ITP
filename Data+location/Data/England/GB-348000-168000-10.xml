		<title>10FLAX BOURTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Flax Bourton is a small rural village 
 close to the city of Bristol.Only a   
 handful of its inhabitants work within
 the village itself the remainder use  
 the busy A 370 road to reach their    
 place of employment mainly in Bristol.
 Its surroundings of fertile farmland  
 and unspoilt countryside make it a    
 popular place to live.Many of its     
 older buildings have recently been    
 modernised yet have still kept their  
 external features.The church although 
 small has a beautiful norman arch and 
 font.The church at Barrow Gurney      
 although not as old has some fine     
 examples of Kemp stained glass        
 windows.                              
 Farleigh Hospital which was originally
 built as a poor house is a good       
 example of Victorian building.
