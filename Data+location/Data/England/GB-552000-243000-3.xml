		<content> About two dozen ladies in Hadstock    
 meet once a month in the village      
 hall for a meeting, which usually     
 centres around a talk or demonstration
 by an invited speaker. Some of the    
 members are quite young, and others   
 have been members for many years.     
    Most of the WI members are also    
 involved in other village activities, 
 so that when an event like the village
 fete draws near, everybody is involved
 in preparing things to be sold on     
 the stalls. But one particular way in 
 which the WI has helped other people  
 is by knitting squares to be sewn     
 together to make blankets.            
    The WI sends delegates to larger   
 gatherings of ladies, but because they
 are a small meeting, they may get the 
 opportunity to be represented only in 
 alternate years.                      
                                       </content>
