		<content>   Berkhamsted's scientific and        
 technological links owe a lot to sheep
 for it was in this town that William  
 Cooper invented his famous sheep dip  
 for the control of parasites.His small
 company grew into a worldwide business
 concened with animal health products. 
 In 1959 the company was taken over by 
 "Welcome", a well known pharmaceutical
 company.In turn the Welcome Foundation
 merged with the animal health division
 of ICI in 1984 to form "Coopers Animal
 Health" with its international        
 headquaters in Berkhamsted.           
   Berkhamsted is also increasingly    
 being used as a base for many young   
 computer firms. The earliest thought  
 to be based here was F.International  
 and these companies are concerned with
 writing programs and marketing both   
 software and hardware.
