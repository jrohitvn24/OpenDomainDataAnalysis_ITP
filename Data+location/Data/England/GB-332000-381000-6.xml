 have to travel widely for their job,  
 and few work shifts. Working abroad is
 uncommon. Of those employed, about 50%
 need to use computer technology as    
 part of their jobs. 80% of working    
 people belong to Trades Unions.       
 Employment in families is centred on  
 the man, with few married women in    
 employment.80% of families have at    
 least one member receiving            
 unemployment benefit. The prime       
 industry is manufacturing.            </content>
