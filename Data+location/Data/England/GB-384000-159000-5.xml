		<title>05FLOODING AT STAVERTON</title>
		<content>   Often when there has been heavy rain
 for several days, the River Avon      
 floods in the valley at Staverton. The
 water gushes down by the bridge and   
 lots of broken trees and grass are    
 carried with it.                      
   The road floods and often vehicles  
 get stranded with water coming inside 
 and the drivers having to wade up the 
 road.                                 
   When the fields are all flooded,    
 there is a man with a sailing boat who
 sails round the fields.               
   If you stand in the churchyard,     
 there is a lovely view of the floods  
 and people come from all the villages 
 around to have a look and to laugh at 
 those who get stuck!                  
   One year, the floods came during the
 winter and some of the fields where   
 the flood was not too deep froze and  
 everyone had fun sliding on the ice.  </content>
