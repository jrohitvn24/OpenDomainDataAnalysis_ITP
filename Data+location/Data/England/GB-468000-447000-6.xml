		<content> There are lots of games children play 
 after school.Most children like to    
 play on their bikes in the streets and
 lanes of the village.Some people have 
 a home computer and play Donkey Kong, 
 Hopper, Boxer and other games.        
     Children also play outside.They   
 play games such as Football, Tennis   
 and "Horses." Horses is played like   
 this.One person is an owner , another 
 a horse.They act as if they own a real
 horse and have paddocks and sometimes 
 use people to act as thieves.A popular
 game is "Blockie" where one child is  
 "it" and the rest run off and hide.   
 The first child  looks around and     
 tries to find them.When he sees one he
 runs to the "blockie" post and says   
 "Blockie 1,2,3.-you're out".When      
 everyone is"blocked" the first to be  
 caught is "it" and the game continues.
