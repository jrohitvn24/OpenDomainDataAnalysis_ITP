		<title>10WATER POWER</title>
		<content>   In the original Domesday Book,we    
 find that a mill was recorded in      
{Hartlebury.}We went to see the mill.  
 There was a very large wheel no longer
 in the water but standing on the      
 grass.Scattered around were it's many 
 parts.The{mills grinding}wheels were  
 now used as steps,still showing the   
 patterns and power.The water routes   
 were still visable and the{pounds}were
 so clear that fish and eals were      
 easily seen.{Wilden}too had its own   
 mill,certain of the old villagers     
 still talk about it but we can only   
 see where it used to be.It is         
 remembered for it's noise and size.It 
 was stopped at night by diverting the 
 water.Mutton fat was used to lubricate
 the wheel.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
