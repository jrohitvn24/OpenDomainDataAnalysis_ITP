 This is an area of chalk downland     
 and is within an region designated an 
 Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.   
  Once wholly forested,it has during   
 the last 50 years been brought almost 
 entirely into arable farmland.The     
 remaining woodland is a mixture of    
 broad leaf trees and conifers.        
 There are six separate farms but no   
 village community.                    
 The area is divided by two through    
 roads and a few lanes.                
 A local beauty spot known as Little   
 Switzerland is a north/south running  
 punch bowl valley.
