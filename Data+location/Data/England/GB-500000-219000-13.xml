		<content> The Saint Mary The Virgin Church is a 
 Norman Church built between 1080 and  
 1100 A.D. The next renovation was in  
 the 14th century when a new lead roof 
 was put on.                           
   During national and local fights the
 villagers would flee to the church for
 sanctuary.                            
   The vicar of Kensworth, Whipsnade   
 and Studham is Rev. Father John       
 Sheperd and he has been in residence  
 since 1983.                           
   The main festivals are Christingle, 
 Carol Service,  Rogation , Mournday,  
 Good Friday and Harvest.
