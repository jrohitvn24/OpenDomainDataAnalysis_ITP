		<title>14Well Vale House</title>
		<content> The building of the present house at  
 Well Vale started in 1721 and was     
 completed in 1733.The owner at this   
 time was James Bateman, who became a  
 governor of Alford Grammar School in  
 1725. The estate dates back to the    
 Norman Conquest and was also mentioned
 in the last Domesday Book. The estate 
 contains 17O acres.                   
   In 1725 two urns were found in Well,
 containing several Roman coins. These 
 are being preserved and one day will  
 be on show in a museum.               
   From the classical revival church   
 which stands north_west from where the
 present house is built there is a     
 pleasant view of the house.           
   The house is at present unoccupied, 
 being last lived in 3 years ago until 
 the death of the last owner. It was   
 used as a film location for BBC's     
{Pride and Prejudice}shown this year.  </content>
