		<content> This low lying area of Holderness has 
 some land below sea level.The coast at
 Tunstall is subject to erosion.The    
 land is used for farming and such     
 crops as barley,wheat, and rape seed  
 are grown.Some farmers have cows,pigs,
 sheep,hens,cattle and horses.Around   
 Roos there are mixed deciduos woods.  
 Fields are separated by hedges and    
 dikes.There are quite a lot of wild   
 animals like moles,rabbits,badgers,   
 stoats and weasels plus a variety of  
 wild birds,like pheasants,partridges  
 and pigeons.                          
 The roads are very twisty and follow  
 the shape of the fields and dikes.The 
 nearest shopping centre is Withernsea 
 but many people go to Hull for their  
 main items of clothing and furniture. 
 Withernsea is 5 miles away and Hull is
 15miles away.
