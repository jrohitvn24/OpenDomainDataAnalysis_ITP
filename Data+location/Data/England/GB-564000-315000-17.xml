		<title>17Impressions of North Runcton</title>
		<content>  We asked some of our pupils who live 
 on a housing estate in Kings Lynn     
 whether they would like to live in    
 North Runcton. They mostly agreed that
 they liked the peace and quiet there  
 and one girl said that the village    
 green was very pretty.                
  But all thought that there was too   
 little to do there and they did not   
 like the idea of not being within     
 reach of shops. One pupil was put off 
 by the fact that there were no street 
 lights. They said that without a bus  
 service they would not be able to go  
 anywhere. Many also disliked the fact 
 that the busy main road was close.    
  When we asked the same about         
 Middleton our pupils disliked the     
 noise from the main road and most did 
 not want to go to so small a school.  
  One boy said he liked North Runcton  
 because there was no schoolthere!     </content>
