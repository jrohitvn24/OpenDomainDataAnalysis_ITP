		<title>19Truro - Cornwall's Centre 1</title>
		<content> Truro is the only City in Cornwall. It
 is not the County town, Bodmin is,    
 though the County Courts are moving to
 Truro soon. It is not the largest     
 urban area, St Austell is,but recently
 Truro has become the fastest growing  
 and most prosperous town in Cornwall. 
 Truro is a centre of Cornish life in  
 many ways. It has good communications,
 several main roads converge here, it  
 has a main line station and a bus     
 depot. County Hall, the Headquarters  
 of the County Council, is on the      
 outskirts of the City, providing      
 employment and activity. Cornwall's   
 two main hospitals are here, Treliske 
 just outside our area, and the City   
 Hospital, providing Casualty and      
 Ambulance service for most of the     
 County. The Cathedral and Bishop of   
 Truro are the focus of Church of      
 England activities in the County.     </content>
