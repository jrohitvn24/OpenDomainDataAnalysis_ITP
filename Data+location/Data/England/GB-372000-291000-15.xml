		<title>15Severn Park</title>
		<content> Severn Park is a large area of land   
 which runs alongside the river        
 Severn in Bridgnorth. Once an area of 
 common land, it is now laid out so    
 that visitors and townspeople alike   
 can enjoy a large park like area in   
 which to play games, have a picnic    
 or sit and look at the scenic         
 countryside. It is planned that in the
 future the river will be made         
 navigable and there will be a number  
 of pleasure craft on the water.The    
 other side of the park is formed by   
 the natural barrier of the High Rock  
 and the continuation of the wooded    
 slopes of the Hermitage Coppice.      
 A favourite place for fishermen and   
 photographers alike, this area        
 attracts people from many miles away.
