		<title>01Kippax Area</title>
		<content> This block is                         
 predominantly a farming area          
 containing several small farms which  
 are mainly concentrating on cereals.  
 There are also a couple of soft fruit 
 growers and a pig farm. The land is   
 boulder clay through which runs a band
 of magnesium limestone. In ancient    
 times this band of hard rock, which   
 runs north/south, acted as a natural  
 roadway for early man. The villages in
 this area owe their original          
 settlement to the proximity of this   
 natural roadway. The main village is  
 kippax which stands on an elevated    
 situation and in the time of the      
 Saxons there was a raised mount as    
 well for the purpose of defence. This 
 was called the keep near which stood a
 memorable Ash tree -  hence the name  
 Keep-Ash (Kippax).
