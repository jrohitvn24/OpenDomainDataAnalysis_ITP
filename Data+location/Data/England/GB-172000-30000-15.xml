		<title>15BUILDINGS IN TREVERVA</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The buildings around Treverva are made
 mostly out of granite rocks and slate 
 for the roofs.The slate is supported  
 by a wooden frame.Most of the houses  
 are old but have been modernised,you  
 can still tell the old design.In one  
 of our three grid squares that we     
 looked at there were seven residential
 houses and a couple of farms,there was
 also a caravan and campsite.          
   The farmhouses were large and like  
 the residential houses they were made 
 out of granite and slate.We did not   
 see any derelict houses in the whole  
 of the area.We saw 3 terraced houses  
 of the same shape,size and design.One 
 of the owners had lived in the house  
 for 8 years and never had any problems
 with it.
