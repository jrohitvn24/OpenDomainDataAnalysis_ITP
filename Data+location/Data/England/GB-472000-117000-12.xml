		<content> the Cave family consisted of 2 parents
 and 5 children, who were supported by 
 14 indoor servants and 14 outdoor     
 workers. For a 'Coming Out Ball' a    
 special train ran from London to      
 Ditcham. It stopped at Woodford, where
 the carriages met the guests. At 1am  
 the driver whistled indicating he was 
 departing. When a famous Polish       
 pianist gave a recital aparticular    
 make of piano was sent from London and
 hauoed up the steep hill from         
 Petersfield. At Christmas Mrs Cave    
 went to London to buy presents for the
 100 children of the estate. the Caves 
 left Ditcham in 1921 for Stones Hill. 
 Then the house was used for Douai RC  
 as a boys' preparatory school for 27  
 years. It was bought by a Bagshot     
 based property dealer and it became   
 the present school.
