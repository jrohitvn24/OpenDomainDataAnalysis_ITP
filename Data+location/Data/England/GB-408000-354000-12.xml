		<content>     Parish councillors deal with small
problems such as holes in the roads,   
lighting, traffic problems and visit   
places if something is wrong.  They    
meet every six weeks when they discuss 
planning applications and also         
recommend what should be done.         
     There is a lot of committee work  
at Leek District Council level - Health
Committee, Planning Committee (home    
extensions, new housing, conversions), 
Amenities Committee (swimming-bath,    
playground, sports centre), Policy and 
Resource (decide how money is spent).  
     The Staffordshire County Council  
deal with the whole of the county      
including our area.  They deal with    
education, libraries and the           
fire-service which is all run from     
Stafford.  Our County Councillor is Mrs
Eileen Critchlow.                      
     Our M.P. is David Knox.           </content>
