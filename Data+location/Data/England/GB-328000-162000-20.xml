		<content>   Methodism started in Weston in 1791.
 By 1847 a methodist church was        
 opened.However this place was not     
 large enough and so in 1879 the       
 foundations were laid for a new church
 in church road.In 1883 a sunday school
  was opened and continued to meet for 
 a number of years.in 1886 a special   
 purpose built school room was opened. 
 the sunday school was so popular that 
  it needed more room. During 1940 the 
 school room was used as a canteen for 
 soldiers billeted in the area.        
   In the past the church was kept     
 open for people to use but now it is  
 mainly locked.The reverend J.M.Bailey 
 B.D is now running it.
