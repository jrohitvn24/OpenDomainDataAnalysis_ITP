		<content>{My name is Emma Law and I go to       
{Wallace Fields First School.          
 I get up at 7:00 AM and have my       
 breakfast. After that I do my hair. At
 8:40 we walk or drive to school. It   
 takes a quarter of an hour to get to  
 school if we walk. Sometimes I walk on
 my own. I play in the playground until
 the whistle blows and then I go into  
 school and do my work. I have a packed
 lunch of sandwiches, biscuits, crisps 
 and an apple. After lunch I go out to 
 play. I pretend to run an exercise    
 club. In the afternoon we make cakes, 
 use clay or do origami. On Wednesdays 
 we have a cake sale. Each cake costs  
 5p and you can only buy one. Miss     
 Woodall reads us a story before we go 
 home.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
