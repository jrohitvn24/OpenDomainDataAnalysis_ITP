		<title>12Services in Dean</title>
		<content> The villages of Upper and Lower Dean  
 come under North Bedfordshire Council,
 whereas Tilbrook is in Cambridgeshire,
 so although few miles separate the    
 two, there is little link between them
 . For example the Bedfordshire Mobile 
 Library visits Dean fortnightly, with 
 3 different stops, whereas Tilbrook is
 served by Cambridgeshire Library.     
 The villages are also served by       
 newspaper deliveries, postal services 
 twice daily, a mobile shop from the   
 local shop in Upper Dean, fish and    
 chips and greengrocery shops call in  
 the village also.                     
 The Bedfordshire Rural Community      
 Council's mobile information van known
 as BRIAN also calls fortnightly. This 
 holds information on jobs available in
 the area and other useful information.
 The van is manned by an unemployed    
 volunteer.                            </content>
