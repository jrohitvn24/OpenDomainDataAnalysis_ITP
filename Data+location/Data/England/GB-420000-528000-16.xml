		<content> This{home for the mentally handicapped
 is one of{five in County Durham}and   
 is situated in the centre of the      
 Woodhouse Close Council Estate. It    
 caters for{mentally handicapped ladies
 from{South-West Durham.}Opened in     
 1965, it has accommodation for        
 twenty-seven in twenty-three single   
 and two double rooms. It is staffed by
 eleven people:- Matron, deputy, house 
 parents and domestics and at present  
 has twenty-five residents, ranging in 
 age from twenty-two to fifty-eight.   
 During the day, all the ladies work at
 a nearby{Training Centre}and in their 
 spare time they usually knit or sew,  
 but every Monday evening they hold a  
 "disco". The ladies get very few      
 visitors but but all go away for at   
 least a week in every year. They often
 go to the{Leisure Centre}and all seem 
 to enjoy living in the home.          </content>
