		<title>10FREEMANTLE PARK FARM</title>
		<content>  Freemantle Park Farm covers 142.4    
 hectares or 351.88 acres. The soil is 
 chalk in some places, and in other    
 places clay with flints over the      
 chalk. The crop-growing land is 65.8  
 hectares, and grazing for cattle      
 covers 56.5 hectares. There are 4.9   
 hectares of woodland, and buildings   
 and roads cover 7.5 hectares.         
  The crops grown are wheat, barley,   
 grass and kale. There are70 Friesian  
 cows, and a further 70 heifers or     
 young stock. The average milk yield of
 the cows is 5900 litres. There are    
 three men working on the farm. There  
 are four tractors, and a contractor is
 employed for big jobs. Fertilizers are
 used for growing the wheat and barley,
 and also on the grass for the cows.   
 Trees are replacing hedges as they    
 make better windbreaks.
