		<title>10Law and Order in Cowlinge</title>
		<content>                                       
The nearset police station to Cowlinge 
is in the town of haverhill, but the   
village does have a 'Village Policeman'
who looks after the needs of four      
villages in the area. He tours around  
these villages constantly by car, and  
has made it his duty to visit every    
family as a friend, to call on in a    
time of need.There is very little      
trouble in the village and the         
occasional 'break-in' is always        
attributed to someone outside the      
village, possibly from a nearby town.
