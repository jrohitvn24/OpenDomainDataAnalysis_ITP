		<content>{Corn for Animal Feed                  
 In November and December the ground is
 ploughed.In March and April the soil  
 is harrowed to make a seed bed.After  
 that, a combine drill drills the      
 manure and corn.Then the ground is    
 rolled to make it firm. After the crop
 has grown its third leaf,it is sprayed
 for weeds and disease and it is left  
 to ripen.It is harvested by a combine 
 harvester in July and August.The      
 combine threshes the corn and cleans  
 it and the straw is left for the      
 baler.The corn is then sent through   
 the drier where it is dried until the 
 moisture is about 12-15%,and then it  
 is stored.In November it is milled    
 through a crusher,protein is mixed    
 with it and it is used to feed the    
 livestock.The straw is used for       
 bedding.Most of the corn grown is     
 barley or wheat.(cont. on P.6)        </content>
