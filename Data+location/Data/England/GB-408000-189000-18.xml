   54  people  are living on farms in  
 this area.                            
 Nicholas Harding lived in 1279 and

 Hardings'.                            
   John de la Welle lived on Wells Farm

   Names of people who supported  the  
  Quakers and Methodists( e.g. Thomas  
 and Carter) still survive today .     
  We have discovered that Mr.E.Clark   
 bought The Reading Room(1973)         
 from Miss Warrender of Purton Stoke   
 House. Now 4 Clarkes' live at the same
 residence.                            
   Harding is an early 12th century    
 name coming from an old word meaning  
 'hard'.It had Fitz in front of it eg  
 Fitz Harding .                        
   Clerk was a scholar from Henry 1.   </content>
