 ONE ADVANTAGE OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY
 IS WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND       
 HEARING ALL THE BIRDS SINGING-THIS IS 
 VERY PLEASANT INDEED.ALSO WHEN YOU GO 
 FOR WALKS,YOU CAN SEE SO MANY ANIMALS.
   ONE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO
 TRAVEL INTO COLCHESTER IF YOU WANT TO 
 BUY ANYTHING OTHER THAN GROCERIES.IF  
 YOU DO NOT GET A LIFT INTO TOWN BY CAR
 IT TAKES SO LONG BY BUS.THERE ARE NOT 
 THAT MANY PLACES FOR US TO PLAY,SINCE 
 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED IN TO MOST OF THE  
 FIELDS.ONE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE,IS THAT  
 PEOPLES GARDENS ARE BIGGER THAN IN THE
 TOWN,SO WE USUALLY CAN PLAY MUCH      
 BETTER GAMES IN THEM.I LIKE LIVING IN 
 THE COUNTRY,BUT I WOULD LIE TO LIVE IN
 THE TOWN,JUST TO SEE WHAT THE         
 DIFFERENCE WAS LIKE.
