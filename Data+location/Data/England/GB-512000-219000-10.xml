		<title>10Paul's School Day</title>
		<content> My name is Paul Abrahams. Iam nearly  
 9 and I have two brothers ,Ian and    
 John and one sister Kathryn. I am the 
 oldest and I help my mum and dad . I  
 go to school with my two brothers. I  
 go to Breachwood Green School. On     
 Monday July 1st 1985 I was the last to
 line up. After the whistle I put my   
 lunch box in the basket and then I    
 changed my shoes.I sat on the carpet  
 and Mrs Thurlby called the register.  
 Then we had news and then I went into 
 Assembly. I sang a hymn. When we went 
 back into the classroom I did my      
 spellings.I did my maths.Soon it was  
 playtime and I played football. Next I
 wrote a story.Then it was lunchtime.  
 After lunch I played football again.  
 In the afternoon I practised for      
 sports day. I went home at 3.15p.m.
