		<title>13Fishing on the Eyebrook.</title>
		<content> This reservoir is popular as a trout  
 fishery.Only fly-fishing is permitted 
 but over 20,000 trout are caught each 
 season.Fishing,by permit only ,costs  
 Â£150 per season.Day and evening       
 permits are available and boats hired 
 daily cost Â£6.00 for fishing or bird  
 watching.The perimeter road is        
 restricted in the east to permit      
 holders,as it is considered the       
 environment might suffer if access    
 were uncontrolled.At the fish farm in 
 the S.E.corner are 8 fishponds where  
 trout fry grow before being released  
 into the reservoir.Ponds are protected
 as herons prey on the fry.Large fish  
 lorries have difficulty in crossing a 
 small bridge over the Eyebrook south  
 of the dam,so are rerouted through    
 Stoke Dry.
