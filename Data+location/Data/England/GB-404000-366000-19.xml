		<title>19Hang Gliding</title>
		<content>Hang Gliding started in the ninteen    
fifties, scientists were experimenting 
with parachutes to bring satellites    
back to earth from moon shots,they     
developed a triangular paracute.       
Someone had the idea of using   it     
to glide.The wing span is about 32     
feet and it weighs 75 1bs.The cost of a
hang Glider is about 1200 pounds.The   
altimeter is to tell the pilot how high
he is,a variometer tells the pilot     
whether he is going up or down,the     
compass is for direction.To fly a      
hang Glider the weather has got to be  
favourable.The material is terylene    
which is yellow and mylon which is     
white with aluminion poles.
