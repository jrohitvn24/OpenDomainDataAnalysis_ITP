		<title>06A STREET IN S.E.LUTON</title>
		<content> I don't quite like Stanley Street now.
 At one end of it there was a fish and 
 chip shop. One day a demolition gang  
 came and knocked it down with         
 bulldozers and a crane with an iron   
 ball on a chain. Then the site was    
 surveyed. After that the builders     
 came and built rows of houses. Now,   
 behind my house,they are building     
 more houses and when we are playing   
 in the garden,sawdust blows into our  
 eyes.                                 
 There are not very many parks near us.
 The nearest is in Dallow Road and     
 Stockwood Park is quite a long way    
 away from me. When we move to Hitchin 
 Road there will be factories which    
 will give off fumes but that's not    
 all, because Hitchin Road is a very   
 busy road and cars, vans and lorries  
 roar past all day and all night long.
