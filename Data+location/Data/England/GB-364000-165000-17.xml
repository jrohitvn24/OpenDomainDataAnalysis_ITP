		<content> Our route took us along the northern  
 boundary of the school playing field, 
 which is marked by a chain-link fence.
 We noticed that this extended all     
 round the field although it was rein- 
 forced by a hedge along its southern  
 side beside the B3116.                
  The path we took was overgrown with  
 grass and stinging nettles.We soon    
 reached a stream where the bushes grew
 thickly.We crossed the stream by means
 of a wooden plank bridge.We saw water-
 cress growing.This stream started at a
 spring in the fields to the north and 
 ran southwards to join the River Avon.
 To the south were the farm buildings  
 of Withies Farm,still surrounded by   
 the remains of the withies which gave 
 it its name.The surrounding fields had
 been cut for hay,others had cows graz 
 -ing in them.Beyond the Burnett Ridge 
 the fields are used for cereal crops. </content>
