		<title>14THORNBURY CHURCH</title>
		<content> Thornbury Church is a pretty small    
 place. It was founded round about the 
 year 1100 to 1200. It has a Norman    
 doorway. It also has a pound where    
 animals were put if they were found   
 wandering about. If they wanted them  
 back they had to pay a fine. There is 
 the tomb of Sir John and Lady Specott 
 who left a large sum of money for the 
 church and village. They have four    
 children, one at each corner of the   
 tomb. Two of them are holding a skull 
 which means that they died young. The 
 other two are carrying Bibles. There  
 are 5 bells which are in the tower. It
 also has a small organ which is not   
 powered by electricity. It is air     
 pumped.
