		<title>14Sports day</title>
		<content> Sports day is very popular at Brinsley
 school.Every year the children look   
 forward to it because they don't have 
 to do any work at all! They are all   
 different kinds of races,from serious 
 running races to lots of fun          
 events,involving dressing up and      
 clowning around.All our mums and      
 dads come to watch.The school         
 children are divided into four        
 teams;red,yellow,green and blue.This  
 year the main event was the fourth    
 year sprint because two of our fastest
 runners were racing against each      
 other.The atmosphere was              
 electric!Everyone really enjoys sports
 day :the fun,the exitement and        
 especially the afternoon off school!
