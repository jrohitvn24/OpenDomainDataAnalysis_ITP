		<title>06SHOPPING IN RIPLEY</title>
		<content> Ripley is a small town with many      
 shops.There are shops that have been  
 in Ripley for generations like Bowlers
 and Leary's butchers,and Palfree's the
 fish shop.There are new shops like    
 Chinese take-aways,a kebab house and  
 an Indian restaurant.There is a large 
 Pricefighter Superstore,built just a  
 few years ago.Then Kwiksave was built 
 last year.Pricefighter is probably the
 most promising though as there is a   
 car park handy for the shoppers.Wheras
 at Kwiksave there are no places for   
 cars to go.Oxford Street is a very    
 busy street.On Saturdays there are    
 cars and people everywhere.75% of     
 people we asked said that they would  
 like it to be used by pedestrians     
 only.Ripley Market is the main        
 attraction on Friday and Saturday     
 selling a large range of goods.
