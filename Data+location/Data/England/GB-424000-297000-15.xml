		<title>15FAMILY LIFE:-3. by Jenny.</title>
		<content> I live on the A5 (Watling Street).It  
 is a very busy and noisy road.In my   
 family there are four people.         
 My dad works as a salesman for a      
 company called Deltech.My mum used to 
 be an auxillary nurse until she had my
 brother.Now my mum stays at home and  
 is just a housewife.                  
 My brother,David,is fourteen and is at
 Atherstone School.I am twelve and go  
 to Baddesley Ensor Middle School.     
 My house is detatched,with four floors
 It has a little garden at the front   
 and an even smaller one at the back.We
 have six cats and ten goldfish.       
 I go to Girl Guides on a Monday       
 evening,Theatre Workshop in Atherstone
 on a Wednesday,and Youth Club on      
 Thursday.                             
 When I leave school I would like to be
 a vet or,at least,work with animals.
