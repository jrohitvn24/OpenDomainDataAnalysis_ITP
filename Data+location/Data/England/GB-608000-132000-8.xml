		<title>08A Housewife's Life Burmarsh</title>
		<content>   Mrs X is a young housewife who lives
 with her farmer husband and two young 
 children in their three bedroomed     
 house - a barn, converted into a      
 comfortable home seven years ago.     
   Mrs X looks after her family and    
 owns a Tea Room which is particularly 
 busy from Easter to October. She is   
 also responsible for the farm         
 accounts.                             
   All the shopping and cooking for the
 Tea Room is done by Mrs X with some   
 help over the preparation of food from
 her husband and occasional extra help.
 Supplies are bought once a month at   
 the nearest supermarkets in Folkestone
 to which Mrs X drives in the family   
 car. The freezer plays an important   
 part in the planning of meals.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
