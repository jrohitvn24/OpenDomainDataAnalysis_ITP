		<title>06"Metheringham Police"</title>
		<content> Metheringham is not a very big place  
 but we still have a policeman.        
 He helps the Youth Club               
 Committee and goes around the village 
 making sure that there is no mischief 
 being caused by the teenagers.In the  
 Autumn term the 4th. year Primary     
 School children receive visits from a 
 beat policeman, a police dog handler, 
 the underwater search unit and the    
 C.I.D. The children visit  Lincoln    
 Police Station to see the control     
 room, the police vehicles and the     
 cells. In the Summer the police       
 organise a safe cycling course for 11 
 year olds.You have to learn riding    
 skills, hand signals, traffic signs   
 and the Highway Code.A certificate and
 a badge are awarded to children who   
 pass a test at the end of the course.
