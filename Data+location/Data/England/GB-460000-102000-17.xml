		<content> The two thousand men on board were too
 expensive to employ and from 1945     
 onwards there was a gradual decrease  
 in the number of ships in the British 
 Navy, and those in it were much       
 smaller in size.  The Dockyard today  
 is used for ship maintenance, instead 
 of shipbuilding as in 1937.  It is    
 also used as a berth for the Royal    
 Navy ships, but there are a lot fewer 
 ships in the Royal Navy, and          
 Portsmouth Dockyard is much less      
 used as it was in the pre-war days.   
 Its most recent occupant was the new  
 flagship of the Royal Navy the        
 aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.       
 Portchester has recently developed as 
 an overflow from Portsmouth of        
 citizens connected to the Royal Navy. 
 Portsmouth now recruits even more     
 Naval personel than ever before.
