		<title>16WARRENDER SCHOOL RUISLIP</title>
		<content> In Warrender Primary School there are 
 290 pupils from 3-11.At a time of     
 falling rolls the school has 35 to a  
 class and 52 applications for 10      
 nursery places.There are 8 class      
 teachers and 3 part timers as the     
 ratio is 1 teacher to 26.5 pupils.    
 Council spending cuts have meant the  
 loss of French and fewer Music        
 lessons.The Parent Teacher Association
 is very active and increasingly raises
 money for basic items like books.     
 In the nursery the children learn     
 through play in the infants they start
 to learn to read and write. By the    
 juniors most of the learning through  
 play stops and there is more bookwork.
 School dinners have changed a lot.    
 There used to be a set hot meal. Now  
 we have Cafeteria meals. At 11 years  
 pupils leave to go to a local         
 Secondary School like Bishop Ramsey.  </content>
