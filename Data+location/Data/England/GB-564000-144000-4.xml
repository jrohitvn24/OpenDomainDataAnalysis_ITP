		<title>04Shopping in Five Oak Green</title>
		<content>In our village centre there are two    
general grocery shops,"The Supply      
Stores and Post Office"and "The Village
Store". Mr.and Mrs.Pearce,who run this,
say that their best selling item is    
sweets.Other goods they sell are       
groceries,homecare products,fruit and  
tinned pet food.                       
There used to be a bakery,which is now 
Capel Canoes,a butcher and a green     
grocers. Now vans deliver fresh fish,  
green groceries,fish and chips and     
videos.People once did most of their   
shopping in the village.Now they go to 
supermarkets in Tunbridge Wells,       
Tonbridge and Paddock Wood.We use      
Tonbridge and Paddock Wood shops,but   
buy our papers, bread and milk locally 
if we run out.                         
Most people have their milk and papers 
delivered and a few years ago bread was
also delivered.                        </content>
