		<title>12DARTMOUTH'S NEW EMBANKMENT</title>
		<content>   Much of central Dartmouth was once  
 under water and has been{reclaimed    
 over the centuries.{The New Embankment
{Scheme}continues this process by      
 extending much of the {Embankment     
 out another{6}metres into the{River.  
   The Project was begun in December   
 1984 and should be completed in April 
 1986, at a cost of{Â£2 1/4 million.}It 
 will have used over 99O girders       
 weighing a total of 1,5OO tonnes, and 
 employed{3O}men from Tilbury, plus    
{5}supervisors and{5}consultants.      
   When the scheme is complete, all    
{sewers}will have one outfall in the   
 middle of the River. The raised level 
 of the Embankment should prevent any  
{flooding}during extremely high tides. 
   The river entrance to the{Boat Float
 is being fitted with flood gates      
 operated automatically by a mercury   
 switch, before{tides}become too high. </content>
