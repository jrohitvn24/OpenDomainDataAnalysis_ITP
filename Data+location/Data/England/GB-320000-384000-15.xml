		<title>15A TYPICAL SATURDAY. ANDREW.</title>
		<content>   On a Saturday I usually get up at   
 about 7.30am to take our dog for a    
 walk.I normally take the dog down onto
 the beach which is nearby and we      
 usually stay for about half an hour.  
   When I get back my mum is up and I  
 have my breakfast.After that I go out 
 on my bike with some friends until    
 about 11.00am.Then we go shopping.We  
 go either to Chester,Birkenhead or    
 Liverpool.We have lunch out and do    
 more shopping in the afternoon and    
 arrive home at 2.30pm.Then I go and   
 watch the sport on the television     
 until we have our tea at 4.30pm.I     
 usually go out to play with my friends
 until 8,00pm come back,watch the      
 television until 9.00pm go to bed and 
 read for about half an hour and then  
 go to sleep.That is a typical Saturday
 for our family.
