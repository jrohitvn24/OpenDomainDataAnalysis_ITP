		<content>    The twelve squares assigned to us  
 for the survey lie to the North-East  
 of the market town of Spalding.       
                                       
    The land is used largely for       
 agricultural purposes. The land is    
 intesively farmed being that it is    
 very fertile land.                    
                                       
    Lieing along the Southern part of  
 the block is the Industrial Area of   
 Spalding. The now established food    
 processing companies such as Smedley's
 and British Sugar were built here over
 50 years ago. New small factories have
 been encouraged into the area.        
                                       
    There is limited residential       
 property in the area most of it lieing
 along the A16 which runs through the  
 block.                                
                                       </content>
