{RED ROVER.}Red rover needs a team of  
 boys and a team of girls.set the teams
 out parallel and then one person from 
 one of the teams .The named person    
 tries to break through the other teams
 barrier(the barrier was either made by
 holding hands or either linking arms).
 This must be done in ten seconds or   
 less. If they did not manage to do    
 this they had to join the other team. 
 The object of the game was for all the
 people playing to make one big team.  
 However if the person did manage to   
 break through, they went back to the  
 team they were in and the team called 
 a person from the opposite team.      </content>
