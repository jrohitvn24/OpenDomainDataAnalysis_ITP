		<title>14Housing in Upper Strensham</title>
		<content> Among the houses in Upper Strensham   
 only one farmhouse is of any          
 antiquity. The C18 almshouses, facing 
 a trim village green and War Memorial,
 are derelect. Three old peoples       
 bungalows are council owned, but some 
 of the six council houses are being   
 purchased by their occupants.         
   Several buildings have been         
 converted: the school is now two      
 dwellings, the post office is now a   
 private house and two former          
 almshouses have been sold and made    
 into one house. Recently four new     
 houses have been built. Many of the 15
 executive style houses change hands   
 frequently, four are for sale now.    
 There is no main sewer, and the only  
 street lighting is in Court Rd. The   
 village Hall, an 1918 army hut, has no
 sanitation and needs repair. The      
 public house re-opened in Aug 85.     </content>
