		<content>{PRIVATE FISHING RIGHTS IN BETTYHILL } 
 Most of the River Naver is completely 
 controlled by the River Naver Fishery 
 Board, which lets beats to wealthy    
 people for large sums of money. One   
 regular fisher on the Naver is Prince 
 Charles. This brings in a lot of money
 to the proprietors but does not give  
 much work to the locals as most of the
 water bailiffs and river watchers are 
 brought in from other areas.          
{CLUB WATERS AND FREE FISHERIES }The   
 tidal part of the River Naver is      
 divided in two by the bridge. Above   
 the bridge the water is controlled by 
 the Bettyhill Angling Club and        
 visitors can buy day permits for this 
 piece of water. Below the bridge the  
 fishing is free and excellent seatrout
 runs are encountered.
