		<content> North Bransholme was a very nice place
 about nine years ago. It was very     
 quiet, but now there are gangs going  
 around every night and I don't think  
 that it is safe to go out.            
                                       
 The shops used to be very neat and    
 tidy but now there is litter          
 everywhere. The 'Scout Patrol' (a     
 Hull based security firm) have to lock
 up and put alarms on everywhere.      
                                       
 There is a community centre but it    
 only seems to run Bingo for the old   
 aged pensioners.                      
                                       
 I go to the Rugby club for training   
 and also to the club for ten to       
 thirteen year olds on Mondays. There  
 is also a club for older children on  
 Fridays.                              
                                       </content>
