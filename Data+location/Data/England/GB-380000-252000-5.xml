		<content> We are nationally aware of the growing
 elderly population.In that part of St 
 Johns &amp; Lower Wick within our survey  
 block 13% of all adults are retired.  
 The problems of old age are now       
 recognised and practical help         
 given.There are 2 modern council      
 purpose built flat complexes for the  
 elderly;1 housing association flat    
 complex and 3 private nursing homes.  
 The policy of helping the elderly to  
 retain their independence in their own
 homes is organised by the Gereatirc   
 Department of the local Health        
 Centre.Here,health visitors,home helps
 &amp; meals on wheels are organised.A     
 booklet 'Services for the elderly in  
 the City of Worcester' is available in
 which are listed problems likely to be
 experienced,along with services       
 provided to solve them.Bus passes,at a
 low cost are available for pensioners.</content>
