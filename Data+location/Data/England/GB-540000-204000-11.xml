		<content> EACH POND NEXT TO THE FOREST WAY FOOT 
 PATH WAS MAPPED BY A 10m*10m PLAN AND 
 A SURVEY DONE OF THE LAND AROUND      
 IT.THE WATER WAS TESTED WITH UNIVERSAL
 INDICATOR PAPER AND TURMERIC PAPER.ALL
 THE PONDS WERE NEUTRAL AND SHOWED NO  
 AMMONIA OR SULPHIDE POLLUTION.WE      
 DETECTED NO FOAM OR OTHER SIGNS OF    
 POLLUTION.LICHEN SURVEYS SHOWED NO    
 POLLUTION AND STICKLE BACKS,FROGS,AND 
 A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER ANIMAL LIFE   
 WAS FOUND.WATER AND LAND PLANTS GREW  
 VIGOROUSLY AROUND THE PONDS.THE       
 CULTIVATED FIELDS WERE RELATIVELY     
 SMALL, AND LARGE BANDS OF HEDGEROW    
 WERE LEFT AROUND THE EDGES WHICH GAVE 
 GOOD SHELTER FOR WILDLIFE.THERE WAS   
 EVIDENCE OF CROP ROTATION WITH        
 GRASSLAND AND CEREAL FIELDS.
