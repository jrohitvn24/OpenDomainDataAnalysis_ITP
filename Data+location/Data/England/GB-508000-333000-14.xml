		<content> The villages provide quite a wide     
 variety of services between them.     
 Billingborough provides the Fire      
 Service, the Community Policeman,two  
 banks and a mobile bank,a vet who     
 comes to the village hall once a week 
 and a building society. Horbling has a
 solicitor and a building society. The 
 Fire Brigade is a retained volunteer  
 unit who are called out for the local 
 fires and provide backup for the other
 Brigades in the event of a large fire.
  There is no Police station as such in
 the villages but there is an office   
 attached to the Police house.         
  The mobile library comes to the      
 villages once a week.                 
  The ambulance service has to come    
 from Sleaford 10 miles away to take   
 people who do not have their own      
 transport to their hospital           
 appointments.                         </content>
