		<content> Then  my  sponsor,  my  uncle, came up
 from  Batley. He was  doing the Sunday
 People crossword.                     
 We  arrived  at  church  at 10.35 a.m.
 There  were lots  of  girls  and  boys
 looking  very  smart in  their dresses
 and suits.   {RICHARD KOSMALI aged 10.

 May the 20th. MY NEWS.                
 On   Sunday  I  made  my  first   Holy
 Communion and not only that but I read
 a bidding  prayer also.  We  did  some
 singing  and  said  our prayers.  When
 Mass  had  finished we had photographs
 taken  by  the  photographer  then  my
 daddy  and grandad  took a photo of me
 by myself.  Then we went into the hall
 and  had  our breakfast.  I went to my
 nanna  and she gave me a bracelet then
 we went home.  {SARAH BIRDSALL aged 7.
