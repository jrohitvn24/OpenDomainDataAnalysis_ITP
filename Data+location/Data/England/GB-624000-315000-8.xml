		<title>08HOUSES OF SPIXWORTH</title>
		<content>   When we did a random survey in      
 Spixworth we went to Church Lane and  
 Buxton Road.The ages of the houses    
 varied from about six to one thousand 
 years.Some of the houses had one,two, 
 three or even four storeys .          
   One house with four floors was the  
 oldest,some parts were about one      
 thousand years old.                   
   We found that most of the new houses
 were{bungalows.                       
   All of the houses ,except the one   
 which was a thousand years old, were  
 made of{brick};the oldest was made of 
{clay lump}and{flint}.This house was   
 very large and had about sixty windows
 and twenty rooms.                     
   Most houses had a living room,      
 kitchen, and two or three bedrooms;   
 they also had open fires as well as   
{central heating}.The very new houses  
 do not have open fires.               </content>
