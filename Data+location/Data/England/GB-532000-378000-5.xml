		<content>      There are two former schools in  
 the area, Maidenwell and Burwell.     
      In 1973 Maidenwell school was    
 turned in to an outdoor pursuits      
 centre, still in the care of          
 Lincolnshire Education Authority.  It 
 was just one big room, but two        
 sleeping galleries and modern kitchen 
 facilities have been added.  At one   
 time water was taken from a water     
 butt.  Now drinking water has to be   
 taken in containers.  It is run by a  
 special school in Louth, but is open  
 for bookings by special schools       
 throughout the country.               
      Burwell school closed around the 
 same time and became part of a        
 garage/filling station which has also 
 closed recently.                      
      Children in the area now travel  
 to Louth to school.
