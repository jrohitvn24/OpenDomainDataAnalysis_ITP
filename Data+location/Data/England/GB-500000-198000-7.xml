		<content>{ MILL FARM:}Mill farm was built in    
 1847,as a dairy farm.This is its main 
 product today.They do also sell       
 ice-cream,yoghurt,eggs and potatoes.  
 They milk the cows at 5.30a.m it takes
 them ninety minutes to milk 50 cows.  
 They are Guernsey cows. The farmer    
 buys some of the animal feed such as  
 concentrated pellets, but grows  his  
 own straw and hay.                    
 The farm has been in the family for 51
 years,all four people who work on the 
 farm are in the Fitch family,who      
 bought Mill Farm when the Chenies     
 Manor Estate was sold by the Duke of  
 Bedford in 1954.The farm is average in
 size for this area,and is 80 acres.   
     Milk is collected by bulk tanker  
 and cows are bought and sold in Tring 
 or Slough market.Mr.Fitch has a lovely
 house and garden.He says farming is   
 his life, and does not want to retire.</content>
