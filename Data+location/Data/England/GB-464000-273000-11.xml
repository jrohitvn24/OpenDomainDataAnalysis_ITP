		<content>This school was founded in 1609 as a   
Free Writing School,it was re-built in 
1867-this part is now the infant recep-
tion classroom.New classrooms were     
added 1907,during the 1920's,1950's and
1970's.It is a Church of England Aided 
School,the Rev.W.Gibbs being the chair-
man of the Governors.There are now 67  
infants and 96 juniors in the school.  
As schools in the surrounding villages 
of Ravensthorpe,Cold Ashby,Thornby,    
Hollowell and Cottesbrooke have closed 
due to falling rolls the children      
remaining have been bused to Guils-    
borough.This is particularly easy as   
transport is already laid on for the   
secondary pupils to the Guilsborough   
Comprehensive School.The present       
headteacher is Mr.A.P.Jones,there are  
five other full time teaching staff and
eight support staff.
