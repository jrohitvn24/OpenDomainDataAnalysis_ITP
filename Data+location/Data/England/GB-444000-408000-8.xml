		<content>{ Mr.Aaron Wilkinson}is a well known   
 character and author of the book{The  
{History of South Kirkby.}Born in 1907 
 he has seen many changes.The main area
 for living and shopping was Carr Lane 
 where pit houses had been built to    
 accomodate the miners at the new      
 pit.There were also seventeen shops   
 The rest of Kirkby remained mainly    
 rural until 1945.Mr.Wilkinson told of 
 door to door salesmen such as the     
 yeast man,the parafin man,the muffin  
 man and the pot man.He said today was 
 an easier time.The cane was used      
 greatly in school for very minor      
 misdemeanors.Today it is banned.      
{ Mrs.Defty}was born in 1900 and lived 
 in Kirkby nearly all her life.She was 
 one of eight children and so had no   
 money to train as a nurse.No one      
 stayed to school dinners whereas today
 children have a hot meal at school.   </content>
