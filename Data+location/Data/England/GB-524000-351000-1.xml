		<content> Stand at any point within this area   
 and one has an uninterupted view of a 
 flat landscape, dotted here and there 
 with houses and crossed at frequent   
 intervals by ditches and dykes,       
 connecting with larger drains.   Land 
 drainage is of vital importance as    
 some areas are no more than one metre 
 above sea level.   Maintenance of the 
 drains, for which landowners and      
 householders pay an annual rate, is   
 carried out by a Drainage Board.      
 Agriculture is predominant here.      
 Apart from one dairy farm of 240      
 acres, the heavy soil type lends      
 itself best to growing winter sown    
 cereals, with sugar beet, oil seed    
 rape and a small acreage of potatoes  
 and other brassicas grown as break    
 crops.  There is a hamlet at Bunkers  
 Hill, otherwise the population of 170 
 scattered, most having some connection</content>
