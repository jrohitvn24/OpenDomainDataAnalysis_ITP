		<content> One Way. This game can only be played 
 if there is a netball court marked out
 on the playground. There are two      
 homes, either side of the court. About
 six people play, one of whom is the   
 catcher. The catcher runs one way     
 round the lines of the netball court. 
 Anybody coming on a line towards the  
 catcher is caught.                    
 Kickball. This game is very like      
 Rounders, except that whoever is in   
 kicks the ball before attempting to   
 run round the playground. The fielders
 try to stump a skittle to prevent any 
 score.                                
 Other games played are Football,      
 Skipping and Hopscotch. Chase is also 
 called It and Tag. Some children      
 prefer to be quiet at playtimes: they 
 can sit on the benches if they want   
 to.
