		<title>07THE JUBILEE HALL</title>
		<content>   The{Jubilee Hall}in Little Shore    
 Lane was completed in 1980 after years
 of discussion. It is the largest and  
 most used{community hall}in the town. 
 It is hired out for both recreational 
 and social events and is used by a    
 cross-section of the community. For   
 example the elderly go there and many 
 are driven there in the{local minibus 
 to the luncheon club or the{Pop-in    
{Club.                                 
  The{local theatre group}also takes   
 advantage of the stage and lighting.  
{Public meetings}are held there too,and
 it is also frequently hired out for   
 parties,discos and wedding receptions.
