Draycott's local "corner shop" is known
as Percy's. There has been a shop there
for about 60 years, with the present   
owner being in residence for the last  
23 years. It was at one time a fish and
chip shop. Currently he sells          
groceries, green groceries, wines and  
spirits, meat, and confectionary. Most 
of his customers come from Draycott,   
Cresswell, Saverly Green, Forsbrook,   
Fulford , Cheadle and Meir. There is   
some passing trade. The shop opens in  
the morning at 8-30 then closes for    
lunch from 1-00 to 3-00. It closes at  
6-00 and reopens at 7-30 until 9-30.   
Deliveries are made from the shop. The 
shop itself is only about 12 feet wide 
by 30 feet deep. The owner lives at the
 back and over the shop
