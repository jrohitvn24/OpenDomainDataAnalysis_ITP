		<content> There is very little cereal growing in
 this area.Wheat and oats are the main 
 crops with barley coming a poor third 
 (for feed).Oil-seed rape,beans and    
 potatoes can all be found but in small
 acreage.The largest proportion of     
 grass is down to permanent pasture    
 used for grazing hay and silage - the 
 latter being the most popular due to  
 its nutritional value as winter       
 feed.Hedges are well maintained and   
 edge most fields.The craft of hedge   
 -laying has been passed down through  
 generations and is still widely       
 used.The land,especially in Ashburnham
 was once a completely supporting      
 estate.Now it has been sold to        
 individual farmers as small holdings  
 stud or mixed farms.In recent years   
 the sale of tennanted land has altered
 the whole village community.
