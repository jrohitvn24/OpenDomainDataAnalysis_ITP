		<content> In the last ten years two nearby      
 primary schools have closed and the   
 children now travel by bus to         
 Brockhampton school on Bromyard Downs 
 or go to Suckley school. Some         
 secondary schoolchildren go to Malvern
 but most go by bus to  Queen Elizabeth
 school in Bromyard until the age of   
 sixteen.  From sixteen to eighteen    
 they can go to the Sixth Form College 
 in Hereford, or they may choose the   
 technical or art colleges in Hereford 
 or Worcester, or the agricultural     
 college at Holme Lacy.  Holme Lacy    
 involves a complicated daily bus trip 
 of about sixty miles.  There are play 
 schools for the very young at Linley  
 Green, Bishops Frome, and Bromyard. A 
 few parents prefer to send their      
 children to private day or boarding   
 schools.  Adult education classes are 
 held in Bromyard and nearby villages. </content>
