		<content> Not very many people in Porthleven    
 speak the Cornish language but we     
 still use some of the dialect words   
 like{grammersow}for a{woodlouse.}When 
 you meet someone you would say{"All   
{right my cocker?",}if it was a boy and
{"All right maid?",}if it was a girl.  
 If you wanted to go for a walk you    
 would go for a{turn up along or down  
{along,}up a hill or down a hill. If   
 you wanted something to eat say a     
 pasty you would say, Can I have an    
{oggy me'andsome?}Then suddenly if you 
 get into a temper people would say{   
{mazed}and if you were stamping when   
 you were in a temper you would be{    
{stanking.}If you were really happy and
 started to giggle you would be{       
{grizzling}or{grinning.
