		<content>  We interviewed some of the older     
 inhabitants of the village who have   
 lived in the area an average of some  
 50 years.                             
        In the last 50-60 years the    
 village has changed very much.The old 
 mill for instance has been disused for
 some years.The public house and       
 several cottages behind the shop in   
 the square have long since been       
 knocked down.The village seems to have
 changed more on the outskirts than the
 centre.                               
       Wages have changed a great      
 deal.In the 1910's pay was 32         
 shillings a week,but farm labour was  
 10 to 15 shillings.The farm labourers 
 also received wood,coal and numerous  
 other things free.In about 1910,the   
 pension was 7 shillings a week.It     
 later rose to 10 shillings.People     
 began work at 14 years of age.        </content>
