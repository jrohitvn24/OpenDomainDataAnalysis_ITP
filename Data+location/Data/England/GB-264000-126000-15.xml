		<title>15Filleigh farms survey</title>
		<content> We made  a survey of the farms in the 
 Filleigh area. The  majority of the   
 farms keep cows, and many keep  sheep,
 or both sheep and cows.               
 130 cows is the most kept on a single 
 farm in the Filleigh area. 1 cow is   
 the  least in the Filleigh area.      
 The rest vary between 120 and 35. Most
 people keep black and white cows,     
 Friesians, on their farms and some    
 people keep Guernseys for their       
 richer milk to make cream with. In the
 morning people milk their cows between
 the time of 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. and in  
 the evening people milk their cows    
 between the time of 3 p.m. and 5.30   
 p.m..  Some people with just one or   
 two cows who keep them to provide milk
 for themselves can milk them whenever 
 they want.  The people with herds of  
 cows send their milk to Torrington    
 milk centre.                          </content>
