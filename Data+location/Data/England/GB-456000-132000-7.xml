		<title>07ALRESFORD INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>    Alresford is far from being        
 industrialised, being largely a       
 'dormitory' town with the majority of 
 the population travelling to the      
 larger towns such as Basingstoke and  
 Winchester, with a sizeable number    
 commuting to London.                  
    There are, however,two 'industrial'
 areas. The Dean houses a dozen or so  
 small factories , mainly concerned    
 with light engineering such as        
 agricultural and garden machinery, but
 there is also a branch of a cosmetics 
 manufacturing group.                  
    The other zone is New Farm road    
 with again light engineering but also 
 a timber-working concern with large   
 timber yard.                          
    Service industries provide a       
 substantial employment and there is   
 also a toy firm; Alresford Crafts.
