{education}for children between the    
 ages of 5 and 9. The children can then
 move on to one of four Middle Schools 
 on the Island.                        
     Its catchment area includes the   
{village}itself, surrounding farms,    
 Warden, Warden Bay, Leysdown and parts
 of Minster. Most of the children are  
 bussed from these villages.           
     The school is an old building with
 a modern extension which includes     
 classrooms,a playroom, a music room, a
 hall, and a canteen.                  
     There are two infant classes, one 
 class of mixed age range and two      
 classes of older children.            
     Outside is a large field as well  
 as playground facilities. There is a  
 pond and a vegetable patch which the  
{children}tend.
