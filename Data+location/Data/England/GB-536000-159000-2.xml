		<title>02Crewes House, Farleigh</title>
		<content>A stoney, bumpy lane bordered by fields
in which horses graze.Rounding the bend
you see Crewe's House, dating from the 
Domesday Survey. Mary Flint, the lady  
of the house, related its history.     
Fifty years ago it was a children's    
home.It was requisitioned during World 
War II as a home for Canadian soldiers.
The present house dates from 1800,     
containing 16th century rafters,beams  
and the original fireplace and baker's 
oven. The house has been divided into  
three separate houses,two large houses,
a bungalow which was the servants'     
quarters. In the early morning,Mary    
feeds her thirteen cats,three dogs,    
three horses. Housework takes the      
remainder of the morning.Next she      
cooks lunch and dinner.The afternoon   
involves exercising the dogs and       
horses.By evening everyone is tired,   
looking forward to relaxing and T.V.   </content>
