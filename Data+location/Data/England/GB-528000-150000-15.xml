		<title>15A DAY AT St. BEDES SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I walk to the{FRENCHES ROAD ANNEXE}   
 with a friend and we arrive at about  
 8-40 a.m.  The Annexe is part of{St.  
{BEDES SCHOOL}and is used to house the 
 Second Year.  It is made up of two    
 Victorian buildings with a playground 
 between.                              
                                       
 The first thing we do when we arrive  
 at the school is give in our homework,
 then we walk around until the bell.   
 After registration we have an assembly
 in the hall or in our classroom.  The 
 classroom assemblies are better       
 because we do them ourselves.         
                                       
 There are eight lessons each day.  Our
 classes are made up of thirty to      
 thirty-five pupils.  We do most of our
 work in class but each evening we have
 homework which takes about one and a  
 half hours to complete.               </content>
