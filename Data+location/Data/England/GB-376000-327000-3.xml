		<content>{Adbaston}  Mean areas (ha) of crops on
mixed and arable farms are:- Wheat 21, 
Barley 17,Sugar Beet 2.5,Oilseed rape 5
The remaining mixed farm area was grass
divided equally between intensive and  
pasture. An average of 6 ha of feed    
barley was grown on 'livestock only'   
farms, the rest being grassland, evenly
divided as before. On most farms, the  
farmer, plus part-time assistance from 
wife or son was the labour.  Most farms
are owner occupied and well mechanised.
Dairy farmers are disappointed at E.E.C
quota limitations on milk production.  
Beef and cereal producers worry that   
their products are in surplus. However 
a 12.1 ha block sold at 5928.00 pounds 
per ha and farmers living standards do 
not appear to have suffered yet. The   
harvest was late due to high rainfall, 
most cereal crops were badly lodged.
