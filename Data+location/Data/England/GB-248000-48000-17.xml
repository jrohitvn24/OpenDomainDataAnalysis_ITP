		<title>17FOOTPATHS</title>
		<content> The footpaths in Wembury are very     
{steep}in parts especially around HMS  
 Cambridge. Our teacher took us for    
 a walk  around the{coastal footpath}by
{Heybrook Bay}and{HMS Cambridge.}We had
 walked from the school across to Bovi-
 sand Lane along footpath no. 1.{When  
{we walked by HMS Cambridge we saw a  }
{piece of metal jutting out in the mid-
{dle of the path.}So{Simon Merrill}wro-
 te to the Clerk to the{Parish Council 
 to tell her about it. Mrs. Williams   
 sent Simon's letter to the{South Devon
{Heritage Coast Service}because the{   
{Parish Council }are not responsible   
 for the{coastal paths,only the inland 
{paths. The SDHSC}have now informed    
 their Warden of the problem. In the   
 grid area are these footpaths: 1-20,  
 22,30,and 31. The{Wembury Illustrated 
{Footpath Guidebook (published by the  
{Parish Council) gives full details.   </content>
