		<title>13My Holiday.</title>
		<content> In 1984 I went on holiday to the South
 of France. We stayed in a mobile home 
 on a camp site. There was an outdoor  
 swimming pool. I went to it nearly    
 every day with my brother. I learned  
 to dive there. When Mum and Dad came  
 to watch me they sat at the bar. A bar
 is a place where you can buy drinks.  
 There is a fence around the pool to   
 separate the bar from the pool. There 
 were two pools, a little one for the  
 babies and non-swimmers. David and me 
 went in the big one. There was a dance
 floor near the bar and every night I  
 went to a disco there. One day David  
 and me hired BMX bikes. Some days the 
 family went to the beach.
