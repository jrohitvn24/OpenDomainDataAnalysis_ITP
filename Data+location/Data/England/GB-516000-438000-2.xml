   The largest village in our area is  
 Withernwick, but that is still quite a
 small village. It has fields all      
 around it. About 430 people live in   
 the parish of Withernwick.            
   If you come to Withernwick you will 
 find a post office, a pub called the  
 Falcon, a Methodist chapel and a      
 butchers's shop all on Main Street.   
 St. Alban's Church is at the corner of
 Church Lane and West Lambwath Road.   
 (Lambwath is the name of a near by    
 stream.) The school with 45 pupils you
 will find on Aldbrough Road on the    
 outskirts of the village. There is    
 W.I. Hall on Aldbrough Road too.
