		<content> breakfast. My dad gets up at about    
 10.45 a.m. and has his breakfast.     
   At noon, my brother, Steve and I,   
 take our dog, Gilbert, to Steve's     
 girlfriends. She lives in Monton.     
   We get the bus there and call for   
 Alina, and take our dog and her dog   
 for a run.                            
   At 3.00 p.m. we get the bus back    
 home. We arrive home at 3.15 p.m., and
 my mam, dad and gran arrive home from 
 the pub.                              
   We have our Sunday dinner then which
 is always a joint.                    
   After dinner my gran goes home and I
 do my homework. I watch television    
 until 7.00 p.m., give the dog his     
 dinner and take him for a walk. Whilst
 I am out, my mam makes me a snack.    
   I play records until about 10.30    
 p.m.,and I go to bed at 11.00 p.m.
