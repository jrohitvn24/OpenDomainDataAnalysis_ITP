		<title>11The canal at Bolton-le-Sands</title>
		<content>                                       
 The canal at Bolton-le-Sands is part  
 of the Lancaster canal which connects 
 Preston with Kendal.  It runs in a    
 north/south direction.  The engineer  
 who built the canal was called John   
 Rennie.  The purpose of the canal was 
 to provide cheap{transport}for the    
 movement of coal, limestone, timber   
 and other commodities. Today, two main
 types of boats use the canal: pleasure
 boats and narrow boats.  The canal is 
 also used for other activities        
 including fishing and cruising. You   
 can hire a boat and  it will take  you
 past reed covered banking which is    
 gradually crumbling away because of   
 erosion.  Today, the maintenance of   
 the canal is the responsibility of the
 British Waterways Board.
