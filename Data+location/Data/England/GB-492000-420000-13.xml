		<title>13WINTERINGHAM PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> All Saints Church  stands  at the west
 end of the village.   The large, stone
 built church  with  a  20  metre  high
{tower }is  surrounded  by   a   burial
 ground. 900 years  ago  Domesday  Book
 said  "Winteringham has a Church and a
 priest".  Parts  of  that  Church  are
 still standing.  Some  of  the  stones
 used  in  building  the  tower in 1450
 were taken from the  Roman  settlement
 of  Ad  Abum.  There  are{ arches }and
{aisles} on  each side of the{nave.}The
 pointed arches to the north were built
 earlier than  the  rounded ones to the
 south. The long{chancel }was  built in
 about 1200. The five{bells,}the oldest
 one dated 1705, now stand on the floor
 of the tower.  The {burial  ground }is
 still used and {headstones }date  from
 1720.
