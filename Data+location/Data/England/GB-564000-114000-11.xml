		<title>11FARMING - LIVESTOCK</title>
		<content> Within thhe last two decades, the     
 farming of dairy cows has changed     
 considerably.Where there was once     
 numerous milking herds in the area    
 there are now only three. Two pedigree
 fresians and one channel island. The  
 majority of farms have cross-bred beef
 herds of varying size, 70% of which   
 are sold at the local markets of      
 Heathfield and Hailsham. There are    
 several large flocks of sheep in the  
 area, mostly Kent or Kent cross.There 
 was a piggery but no-one now has pigs 
 on a commercial scale. Pheasant       
 rearing was a very prevalent industry 
 in the past and supplied birds on many
 large estates. Today there are no     
 hatcheries - the birds are brought in 
 as chicks by individual farmers for   
 their own syndicates and this is one  
 possible reason why the pheasant      
 population is diminishing.            </content>
