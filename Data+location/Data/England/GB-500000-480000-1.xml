		<content>  A fertile and intensively farmed area
 along the flat valley bottoms of the  
 Rivers Derwent and Hertford. Large    
 fields and mainly arable farming      
 utilise the fertile soils. No villages
 are situated in the block and most    
 residents live inthe scattering of    
 farms. The main York to Scarborough   
 railway and the very busy A64 road    
 pass through the block.  In the south 
 there is a caravan site which is a    
 convenient place for tourist with     
 transport to say for access to coastal
 and moorland locations. The block     
 itself is not particulry attractive   
 for tourists. There are a few         
 plantations, mainly deciduous.
