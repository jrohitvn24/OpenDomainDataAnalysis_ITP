		<content> We had many walks along country lanes,
 bridleways and footpaths.The{lanes    
 were very quiet and did not have      
 pavements,but there were grass verges 
 which we had to use if any traffic    
 came along.The{bridleways}are wide    
 enough for a farmer's tractor.Horses  
 also use them so they were often very 
 uneven where the hooves had pressed   
 into the ground.This made it difficult
 for us because when it was dry the    
 ruts and hollows hurt our feet,but    
 when it was wet we had to make our way
 through lots of puddles, some of which
 were very deep.The{footpaths}were much
 narrower and often went across fields 
 so we had to take care that we did not
 damage the crops. Sometimes we had to 
 climb over stiles which the Ramblers' 
 Association put up.
