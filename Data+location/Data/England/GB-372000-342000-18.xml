		<title>18THE CHURCH AND THE CHAPEL</title>
		<content>{St. Leonard's Church,}built in 1832,  
 had its tower added later.   It is in 
 the diocese of{Lichfield. }           
 When we asked the children we found   
 that, out of 26, 10 families attend   
 Sunday School, that 7 attend church   
 every week and that 6 do not attend   
 church at all.                        
 Because the{Roman Catholics}do not    
 have a church in Woore, they have used
 St. Leonard's for their services.     
 There used to be 2{Methodist}chapels  
 in Woore, but one closed down and was 
 made into Chapel Bakery.              
 The other chapel, at the crossroads,  
 was in danger of falling down, so it  
 was all taken down except for the     
 little schoolroom at the back.        
 The{vicarage}is opposite the church,  
 and, last year, the vicar of Woore had
 to become the vicar for St. Chad's at 
 Norton-in-hales as well.              </content>
