		<content>The fairly level land is mainly a well 
drained quite fertile loam and gives   
rise to much arable farming, the main  
crops being wheat, barley and potatoes.
Market Gardening for the Birmingham    
Conurbation is also important,         
cauliflowers, cabbages, peas and beans.
Pick your own rasberries and           
strawberries is a recent development.  
There are a few dairy farms,a little   
cattle fattening.  Temporary grass is  
used for silage. Several grass areas   
are used to graze horses kept for      
riding by local residents.             
At least three bee-keepers have hives, 
some are on farms to aid the           
fertilisation of fruit and a relatively
new crop, oil seedrape.
