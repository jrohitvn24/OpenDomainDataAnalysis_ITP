		<content> The{High Street}was the{main road     
 between{London and Oxford}but it is   
 not so now. High Wycombe became an    
 important{coaching stage,}being one   
 day's journey from both{London and    
{Oxford. Inns}sprang up along the High 
 Street where travellers and horses    
 could rest. Only{Falcon Inn}at the    
 Western end of High Street remains.   
 The{Red Lion Hotel}has been demolished
 to make way for the{Woolworth Store,  
{The Three Tuns}public house remains   
 but recently, the{Co-op}store has     
 become a{McDonalds Take-away.}There   
 are four{banks,}numerous{Building     
{Soicieties, travel agents}and a few   
 small shops. Western end of the High  
 Street is the{Parish Church of All    
{Saints.}On Fridays and Saturdays a    
 street{market}is held in the High     
 Street, which dates from very ancient 
 times.                                </content>
