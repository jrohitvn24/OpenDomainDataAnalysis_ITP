		<title>05THE CAMPSITE NEAR ANDOVER</title>
		<content>     As well as running a small farm   
 rearing beef livestock, the Read      
 family have, since the early 1950's,  
 managed a{seven acre campsite}just    
 outside{Picket Piece.}On the day of   
 our visit it was very hot and life    
 seemed relaxed, but we were soon      
 reminded just how demanding the work  
 is. With only the family to run both  
 the farm and the site life is always  
 busy. The camping area, with its{many 
{facilities,}can cater for over a      
 hundred campers, is open{all the year 
{round,}and attracts{visitors from all 
{over the world.}This means that       
 getting away for even a short break   
 can prove almost impossible.          
     Nevertheless, even though they    
 hardly ever manage a holiday, the     
 Reads don't begrudge the rest of us   
 our increased leisure time. After all,
 it's good for business !              </content>
