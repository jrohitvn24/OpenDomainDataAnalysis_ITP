		<content> The Lanes Redevelopment{(see pp4-5)   
 retained two existing buildings on the
 Lowther Street frontage, the Appletree
 Inn and the Howard Arms. Both were    
 once{State Management Scheme}pubs de- 
 nationalised in 1971.The Appletree was
 designed by the noted architect{Harry 
{Redfern,}but the interior has been re-
 modelled and the name updated to      
 "Pippins".Other Redfern exteriors can 
 still be seen at the Malt Shovel in   
 Rickergate and the Moorish style Cres-
 cent ("Carousel") in Warwick Road,    
 next to the Head Post Office{( p14 )  
 The first SMS "food tavern" was also  
 in Lowther Street, a Redfern convers- 
 ion of the old Post Office into the   
 Gretna Tavern (now the "Shambles".)   
 Original coloured ceramic tiles on the
 front of the Howard Arms have been    
 restored by the present owners.
