 Wakefield Court, Leftwich, is a state 
 controlled residence for 30 elderly   
 women. There are 2 matrons and        
 cleaners. It consists of separate     
 flats and communal areas.             
 One resident, Adena Griffiths, used to
 live in a bungalow on her own. She    
 remembers the estate being built and  
 the High School opening in 1957.      
 Amy Potter has been here for some     
 time. She is 82 years old and has     
 worked for 50 years before retiring at
 65. Another resident remembers playing
 games such as "skipping", "hop-skotch"
 and "tip-stone".                      
 Although the residents say they were  
 well looked after they sometimes felt 
 lonely and missed their old friends   
 and neighbours. They were not allowed 
 to keep pet animals in their flats.   </content>
