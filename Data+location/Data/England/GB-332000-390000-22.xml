<title>22The Food we eat</title>
<content>There is a lot more variety in available food which can be attributed to the ethnic diversity within the city. Fast food is still very popular which has a seen a rise in obesity levels, but now much more diverse and available. People are looking towards fresh, organic and locally sourced food. People are very health conscious and initiatives have been introduced at an early age within schools and nurseries to improve the standard of school dinners and lifestyle. The coffee generation is very present on the high street with shops like Starbucks and Sayers. These shops, which appear on most high street have led to the term 'Sanitised high street' which means that most high streets have the same shops. Most people shop at supermarkets where most things are available under one roof. Independent traders are becoming few and far between.&lt;br />
