		<content>    A village school was founded in    
 1654 and existed until 1968 when the  
 Severn Stoke Church of England Primary
 School was built.What was the old     
 village school is now the Country     
 Club, and rumour has it that broken   
 canes, stolen by the pupils, are piled
 beneath the floorboards.              
    The{Primary School}draws its pupils
 from within a six kilometre radius    
 from Severn Stoke, though many of the 
 children now go to Kempsey Primary and
 the school at Severn Stoke is         
 threatened with closure.
