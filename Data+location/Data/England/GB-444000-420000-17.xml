		<content>  Scarecrow Tigs.                      
 Scarecrow tigs is a game for six or   
 more people .The object of the game is
 to run away from the person who is    
 "on".If you are tigged you stand like 
 a scarecrow.If another player goes    
 under your arms and legs then you are 
 free.When the person who is"on"has    
 got everybody standing like a scarcrow
 the game has finished.The first person
 who was caught is now "on".           
  Bulldog.                             
 Bulldog: a game for any number of     
 people.The person"on"stands in a line 
 along one side.The person "on" says   
 somebody's name.They have to run past 
 the person who is "on".If the player  
 gets past the person "on" all the     
 other people have to try to get past. 
 This goes on until only one player is 
 left.  by Nicola Thorpe &amp; Sam Hodgson.
