		<title>14Holiday Makers</title>
		<content> Sutton is a popular village for       
 holiday makers with its sandy beaches 
 and pleasant amusements.Most holiday  
 makers,especially the older generation
 come for the peace and quiet and don't
 want Sutton to be changed while the   
 younger ones would like Sutton to have
 more entertainment such as a swimming 
 pool and more to do at night. most    
 holiday makers come for 1to 2 weeks   
 and are mainly from Leicester and     
 Nottingham as these are dirty cities. 
 So the fresh air and sandy beaches are
 a nice change.Many holiday makers stay
 at Breakwater Bungalows and other     
 places such as Trusville caravan site,
 Sutton Springs and many stay with     
 relations.Some only visit for 1 day as
 they are staying somewhere else.
