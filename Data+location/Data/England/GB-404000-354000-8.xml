		<title>08Mobile shops - Onecote</title>
		<content>     Onecote has no shops but several  
mobile shops visit the village.        
     Every Friday the butcher's van    
comes to Onecote from Butterton.  It   
arrives at about 4 o'clock and delivers
to most houses and farms in turn.  It  
sells all kinds of meat and poultry and
also sells cans of pop.                
     The grocer's van visits Onecote on
a Tuesday afternoon at about 4.30p.m.  
It goes to each house or farm in turn  
and sells fresh fruit and vegetables,  
as well as canned food and drinks.     
     The milkman delivers milk to      
Onecote every day at about 7.30a.m.  He
calls at most houses selling milk,     
cheese, yoghurt, eggs and cream.       
     The library van from Cheadle      
visits Onecote every other Monday at   
about 4.30p.m.  It stays for half an   
hour on the car park by the Jervis     
Arms.                                  </content>
