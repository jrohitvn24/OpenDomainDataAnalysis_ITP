		<content> In our D block there is 56% Rural and 
 44% Residential. We visited a         
 hairdressing shop and interviewed the 
 manager. On Fridays about 25          
 people come to the shop,roughly 15    
 women and 10 men. At the beginning of 
 the week they get about 5 or 10.      
 Between the age of 20 and 30 the most 
 popular hairstyle is long and casual. 
 Between the age of 30 and 50 the most 
 popular hairstyle is short and curly. 
 The most popular hairstyle over 50 is 
 a curly perm. Perms are ranged from   
 Â£15.50-Â£22.00, because they are       
 charged by the curlers.It is not      
 busier in the holidays because of     
 holiday makers because it is an all   
 round working position. In our area we
 have got approximately 25 hairdressing
 shops, 20 hotels and 15 restaurants.
