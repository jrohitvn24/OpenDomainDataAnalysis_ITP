		<title>01General View Of The Area.</title>
		<content>    This remote rural area is about    
{700 feet above sea level}and the      
 weather can be harsh in the winter. It
 consists of{farmland and forestry,    
 a significant feature being the{      
{Slaley Hall Eastate.}The area is      
 unspoiled and the special feature is  
 the countryside itself, plus the{wild 
{life} it hosts.                       
    To the north, the village of Slaley
 is a typical{"long village",}         
 consisting of one row of houses on    
 either side of the road, nearly a mile
 in length. Building is not permitted  
 outside the line of existing houses   
 and recent years have seen            
 considerable filling of the gaps.     
 Modern houses outnumber the           
{traditional farmhouses}and{cottages.  
 House names such as High Clear and    
 Curlew Cottage indicate distictive    
 features of the area.                 </content>
