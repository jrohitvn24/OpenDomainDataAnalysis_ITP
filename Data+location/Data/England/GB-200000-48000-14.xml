		<title>14Towan Farm Well</title>
		<content> Towan Farm Well is situated about half
 a mile past the farmhouse and is very 
 hard to find.It is like a very small  
 stone house with an archway.The inside
 drops about three feet down to the    
 bottom which is now just mud.It is    
 made out of Pentewan Stone,easily     
 recognisable by the holes in the      
 stone.At the back is a small carved   
 shelf, possibly for throwing money and
 making wishes.Towan may have been     
 inhabited as early as the Celtic      
 period.There used to be a chapel there
 but the remains were taken down in    
 1777.The Holy Well still stands a     
 little way away.It was restored by the
 St.Austell Old Cornwall Society and   
 re-dedicated by Joseph Wellington     
 Hunkin,who was Bishop of Truro, on the
 10th June 1937,
