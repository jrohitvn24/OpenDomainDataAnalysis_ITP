		<content> The village is about 2 miles from next
 village of Benson where there are more
 shops. Some people cycle to Benson, a 
 few walk but most drive tehre in a    
 car. There is a bus service which     
 makes four journies to Wallingford    
 each day except Sunday. On Sunday     
 there are no buses out of the village.
 A mobile library visits the village   
 fortnightly to supply books to those  
 who cannot reach libraries in Benson  
 and Wallingford. A mobile fish shop   
 also visits the village on Fridays. To
 visit a doctor it is necesary to go to
 Benson, Watlington or Wallingford. A  
 volunteer force of drivers takes      
 people by car to visit the doctor at  
 Benson if necessary                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
