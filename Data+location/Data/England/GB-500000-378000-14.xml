		<title>14LOCAL HISTORY : WELTON. 1.</title>
		<content> ROMAN AND SAXON BURIALS AT WELTON.    
 In 1963 when building behind the      
 Council houses in Norbeck Lane took   
 place 13 skeletons wer uncovered. They
 were believed to be Roman.            
 Later in 1971 13 Saxon graves were    
 disturbed when the foundations were   
 dug for the new Community Home - this 
 was then called Saxon House.  Nearby  
 medieval crofts were found.  This land
 had been used for settlement until the
 14C. and then was used for pasture    
 land until the discovery.             
                                       
 THE CARRIER'S DOG.                    
                                       
 Mr. Baldwin's grandfather operated the
 Carrier Service from Welton to Lincoln
 and the surrounding villages. Mr.     
 Baldwin still has the stuffed terrior 
 dog that used to accompany his        
 grandfather on the cart.              </content>
