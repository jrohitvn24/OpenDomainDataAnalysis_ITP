		<title>03HISTORY OF BALDERTON (ctd.)</title>
		<content> coaching station for travellers going 
 North or South. Early in the 19th.    
 century the manor of Newark and its   
 possessions, including Balderton, were
 sold by the Crown to the Duke of      
 Newcastle. In 1840 a New Hall was     
 built which exactly one century later 
 was converted into a mental hospital. 
 The parish of Balderton now consists  
 of 3,700 acres and is a popular       
 residential area, having grown through
 the development of both private and   
 council estates during the last few   
 years. The population has risen from  
 some 4,000 in the 1940's to its       
 present figure in excess of 8,000.
