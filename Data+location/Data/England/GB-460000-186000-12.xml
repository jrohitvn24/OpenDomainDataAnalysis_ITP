Jewish law,customs and history.        
Interested pupils can progress through 
o-level and talmudic studuies to a     
specially designed A-level syllabus    
modern hebrew is offered as an option, 
although this is treated as a language 
seperate from the Jewish Studies       
dpartment.                             
In the grounds there is a modenistic   
{synagogue}which contains interesting  
stained glass.Helped by pupils,the     
Israeli artist Azaz designed this so   
that shards of coloured glass are      
pressed between plate glass.
