		<title>14C,W. SCHOOL IN THE 1930'S</title>
		<content>Early in the 1930's the school still   
belonged to the Church of England, and 
so each morning the rector came in for 
assembly. The school was opposite the  
church, next to the rectory. The       
register was marked morning and        
afternoo, 9a.m.and 1.30 p.m. All pupils
went home for dinner at midday. Anyone 
arriving late for school had a black   
mark. Lessons were very basic; reading,
writing, arithmetic etc. An inspector  
came periodically to  inspect our work 
and check our progress. We sat an exam 
called 11 plus to decide which school  
we moved to, either Banbury Grammar or 
Byfield Elementary. The school had two 
classrooms and two teachers with an    
average of 20 pupils to each. There    
were two playgrounds, one for the boys 
and one for the girls. There were also 
separate cloakrooms. Toilets were out  
buildings at the end of each playground</content>
