		<title>03Public House Litlington</title>
		<content> The Plough and Harrow public house in 
 the village of Litlington has been    
 selling beer since the year 1700. Much
 of today's trade includes the sale of 
 hot and cold meals,both at mid-day and
 each evening.An old tradition has been
 revived because the present landlord  
 serves real ale as in olden times     
 using hand pumps.He serves 5000 meals 
 each month and on occasions even more.
 Once a year a marathon race in aid of 
 charity is run from Eastbourne.This   
 involves about 3000 people and many   
 stop at Litlington's pub for their    
 refreshment - a chaotic but memorable 
 day for the publican.He has made a    
 dining car as on a railway train and  
 people visit the pub to share this    
 railway interest.There is a darts team
 which provides lighthearted fun for   
 local people and visiting competitors.
 A jolly,well patronised place.        </content>
