		<content> Most of the houses in the villages are
 traditional, there are few modern     
 houses. The High Street, Meonstoke is 
 a conservation area and includes only 
 3 modern houses.New properties are    
 usually only permitted when in-filling
 or replacing derelict properties. This
 conservation area is about to be      
 extended. Most of the old houses in   
 Meonstoke High Street post date 1719  
 when much of the village was destroyed
 by fire.Exton has its own conservation
 area.There are four groups of council 
 housing. St.Andrews Green and Niton   
 Cottages, Meonstoke, were built in    
 1947.16 bungalows for the elderly and 
 9 houses were built in Pound Lane     
 between 1960 and 1975. Exton has 4    
 council houses. Niton Cottages and    
 several others are now privatly owned.
