		<title>05A school day in N.Wingfield</title>
		<content> Wednesday is a typical school day.My  
 dad is always the first to get up .He 
 makes a drink for me and my mum.My    
 alarm usually goes off at 7.00.My mum 
 gets up at 7.30 but she does not get  
 dressed until I go to school.At 8.00  
 my dad goes to work and I wash the    
 pots.I walk to school,to arrive before
 school starts at 8.50.On Wednesdays,  
 4th years don't go into Assembly      
 because we go swimming.We come back   
 from swimming after playtime.We have a
 break and then we do maths.At         
 dinnertime I go to recorder           
 practice.After dinner we do maths or  
 English.Sometimes if we have been good
 we have a story.At home time,if my mum
 is on "afters",I go to my grandma's   
 and my dinner is waiting on the       
 table.At 6.00 my dad fetches me and I 
 play out.At 9.00 I go to bed and my   
 mum comes home. Amanda Wallis aged 11 </content>
