		<title>12SCHOOL TRIPS THIS YEAR 1985</title>
		<content>   This year we had two trips away from
 school.In April we went to            
{Charterhouse Outdoor Activity Centre  
 which is run by Somerset L.E.A. We    
 spent 4 days at the centre and went   
{horse riding,caving,swimming,and alot 
{of walking!!! We also had to eat food 
{cooked by Mr Narraway which was not   
{too bad(!)                            
   In June the 4th years went to the   
{Forest of Dean.}We spent 6 Days       
 there.We stayed in large 6 person     
 tents.The only day in really rained   
 was the day we happened to get a      
 little lost so we all got rather wet  
 as you can imagine.We visited many    
 places along the river Wye including  
{Tintern abbey and Monmouth.}Richard   
 kept eating the whole of the time we  
 were away,and Tim,well,he just could  
 not stay on his feet. A great time was
 had by all who went.                  </content>
