 The Stagecoach is a bus run by the    
 Cambridgeshire County Council. The    
 firm has 10 buses covering 11 villages
 . It was set-up because the United    
 Counties bus service moved to another 
 place so the Stagecoach took over.The 
 name Stagecoach was a public decision.
 It picks up children from primary and 
 secondary schools. The prices vary.   
 The drivers favourite day is Wednesday
 which is also the busiest because of  
 the shopping trips which are arranged 
 on that day. People can book the      
 Stagecoach but it doesn't get booked  
 much. It has the very important job of
 taking prescriptions and blood        
 specimens from a local surgery. It    
 also picks up parcels. It cost        
 approximately Â£80 a day to run it. The
 bus runs once a day taking and        
 returning.                            </content>
