		<content> Situated along the A39 the main road  
 used to pass through the village. This
 was the old toll road, properly paved 
 in the 19th century. The old toll     
 house still stands in St. Mary's St., 
 and just along the road are the two   
 coaching inns - The George and The    
 Rose and Crown.                       
 A new Nether Stowey by-pass was opened
 in 1970. The main form of transport in
 this country area is the private car. 
 There are bus services run by the     
 Southern National Bus Company. Buses  
 run on the Bridgwater - Nether Stowey 
 route at about two-hourly intervals on
 weekdays, the last bus leaving        
 Bridgwater at 5.40pm. One bus calls on
 Sunday. The return adult fare is      
 Â£1.80. Coaches provide a service for  
 the schools. From this area there are 
 well surfaced roads to Taunton,       
 Bridgwater, and Minehead.             </content>
