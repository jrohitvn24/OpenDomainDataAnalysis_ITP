 I used to live in Thetford,Norfolk.My 
 dad works for the R.A.F.He flies a    
 plane. He got a posting to Amesbury in
 Wiltshire so we moved to Urchfont.I   
 like it here best. My dad is the      
 Navigator of the  plane. He drops the 
 bombs,and plans the route that the    
 aircraft will take. He goes to        
 Larkhill Bombing Range (On Salisbury  
 Plain) every Sunday,to have a look    
 where the bombs have dropped. These   
 bombs where dropped during the week,  
 while he has been practicing.At the   
 moment he is on a training course     
 learning how to fight and shoot down  
 enemy aircraft.On this                </content>
