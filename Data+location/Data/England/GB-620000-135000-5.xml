		<title>05 SANDGATE CASTLE, FOLKESTONE</title>
		<content>   Sandgate Castle is one of a series  
of castles built by Henry VIII. It is  
important because we know more about   
this one than any other he built.      
The castle, now being restored by the  
present owners with the help of govern-
ment money, is open to the public by   
arrangement. Much archaeological       
excavation has taken place over the    
past ten years to reveal a number of   
interesting features, including Tudor  
cannon and gun ports, Napoleonic candle
and magazine rooms, latrines and a     
well. The excavation has been restrict-
ed to one side of the circular fortress
to enable visitors to see both the     
Tudor features and the Napoleonic      
alterations. When restoration is com-  
pleted in about two years' time,the    
castle will form a tourist attraction  
and a major historical site as well as 
a pleasant venue for private bookings. </content>
