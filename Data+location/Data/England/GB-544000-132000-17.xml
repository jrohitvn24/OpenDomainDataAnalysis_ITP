		<title>17UPPER HARTFIELD WOODS</title>
		<content>   The Paternoster Wood in Upper       
 Hartfield was originally scrub land   
 and was sold with the possibility of  
 it becoming an agricultural holding.  
 The owner hoped to obtain permission  
 for a caravan on the site and         
 eventually a house. In clearing the   
 land,trees were felled illegally,     
 locals became angry as the countryside
 changed without planning permission.  
   The owner started tipping on the    
 land which caused more friction. The  
 Sussex County Council and the Wealdon 
 Council were inefficient in dealing   
 with the legality of this problem.    
 Neighbours and local planners became  
  upset when shelter belt trees were   
 felled (30 feet deep woodland along   
 roadside). It transpires that the land
 is being sold again and assurances    
 that felling &amp; tipping will stop and  
 replantation occur have been given.   </content>
