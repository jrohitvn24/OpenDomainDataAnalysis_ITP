		<title>17Clifton Airfield : Housing</title>
		<content> The second world war airfield at      
 Clifton is being greatly changed as   
 new houses and an industrial estate   
 are being developed on it. Before any 
 buildings could be put up developers  
 had to solve the problem of drainage  
 and this was done by creating a large 
 man-made lake on the east side of the 
 new development This is now almost    
 complete and the first phase of the   
 housing development is well underway  
 some people have already moved in.    
 This area borders on to Green Lane to 
 the south of the lake.There are 200   
 2,3 and 4 Bedroomed semi and detached 
 houses and bungalows being built,costs
 ranging from Â£25000 to Â£48000. Phase 2
 is to begin when the Ring Road is     
 built. It is possible that 1000 house 
 could be built altogether with a      
 district centre and a school.
