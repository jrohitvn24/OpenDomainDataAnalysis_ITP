		<title>09RYDE MARINE TREATMENT SCHEME</title>
		<content>  Ryde and Seaview are both{seaside    
{resorts}with sandy beaches. They have 
 a problem with{polluted bathing water 
 because of the old sewage system. The 
 bathing area does not comply with     
 E.E.C. standards. The Southern Water  
 Authority is starting a{new marine    
{treatment scheme}that will safely     
 dispose of sewage from the Binstead,  
 Ryde and Seaview areas. They are      
 building a{headworks in Appley Park   
 with a{3 km pipe}to take the sewage to
 the middle of the Solent. The pipe is 
 being laid in a trench 20m below the  
 surface. The scheme will cost over    
 Â£6 m and will be completed during     
 1987.                                 
  Because Appley Park is an amenity    
 area, care is being taken to make the 
 site as pleasant as possible. Most of 
 the site will be underground and      
 surface buildings will be landscaped. </content>
