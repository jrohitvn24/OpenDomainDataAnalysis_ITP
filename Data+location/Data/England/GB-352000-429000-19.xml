		<title>19RED ROSE RADIO, PRESTON</title>
		<content>     Red Rose Radio station is in a    
 central position in Preston, that is  
 why the site was purchased. It cost   
 Â£35,000 to buy a church which had been
 derelict for 15 years. In 1981 they   
 decided to use this church and it cost
 Â£780,000 to change it into a radio    
 station. It took 4 months to convert  
 it into the Red Rose studio. The first
 words spoken were by the chairman.    
     The station has many people       
 working there. There are at least 12  
 D.J's employed. The station has 4     
 studios. Studio 1 is the main studio, 
 Studio 2 is the recording studio,     
 Studio 3 is the news studio and Studio
 4 is for recording advertisements. Red
 Rose gets all of its money from these 
 adverts, and is the only commercial   
 radio station in the area.
