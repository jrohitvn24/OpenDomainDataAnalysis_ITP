		<content> BIRCH ROAD RECREATION CENTRE          
 The Birch Road Recreation Centre was  
 opened in 1981.It has lots of sports  
 available like boxing,ju-jitsu,keep   
 fit,five-a-side football and          
 karate.The centre is open to the      
 public from 3.30pm till about         
 11.00pm.There is no membership needed 
 to use the centre.The local schools   
 use the centre during the day.The main
 hall has netball,volleyball,basketball
 and badminton courts.There are also   
 squash courts and a weight training   
 room.From a survey we did of fifty    
 people,forty two didn't know it was   
 there and only five used it.Forty six 
 people thought a full time leisure    
 centre would be a good idea then more 
 people would know about it and it     
 would be useful to those who are      
 unemployed.
