		<content> In North Hykeham there were two       
 manors.Serfs and villains worked for  
 the Lord, and they could do nothing   
 else.Each manor had its own mill.In   
 the 12th century one manor was given  
 to the King of France and the other to
 Christ College Cambridge.Later        
 Geoffrey of Hykeham sold part to the  
 cathedral and some to the Priory of   
 St.Katherine.South Hykeham used to be 
 called Church Hykeham and North       
 Hykeham,Chapel Hykeham.North Hykeham  
 has 19 councillors.                   
 INSIGNIA- At the top is an eagle.The  
 white band down the middle is the     
 Roman Road.The oak leaves and acorns  
 means rural Lincolnshire.At the top   
 right hand corner there is the        
 Katherine wheel.The oak tree stands   
 for the Kesteven Forest.The two       
 windmills stand for the two manors.The
