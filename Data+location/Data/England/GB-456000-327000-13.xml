		<title>13BUNNY VILLAGE GREEN SAVED!</title>
		<content> In June 1984 the{Nottinghamshire      
{County Council}decided to sell off the
{land}in front of{Bunny School.}The{PTA
 and the people of Bunny and Bradmore  
 were angry that their village open    
 space would disappear. A petition was 
 signed by the parents and teachers.   
{Parents and children}went to County   
 Hall with a protest banner when the   
 final decision to sell the land was to
 be made. A photograph and an article  
 appeared in the{Nottingham Evening    
{Post.}The{headteacher}wrote to Kenneth
 Clarke the{M.P. for Rushcliffe}and    
 many other important people. The Bunny
 school{governors}and the Bunny Parish 
 Council tried to stop the sale.       
 Finally the Council agreed to sell the
 land to{Bunny Parish Council}for Â£3000
 so that it would not be built upon.   
 Now Bunny has its own village green   
 which is safe for all time.           </content>
