		<title>09LEISURE AROUND ROMSEY</title>
		<content> One of Romsey's best hobbies is to go 
 fishing.  It is very good for salmon  
 and trout.  All the lakes and rivers  
 around Romsey are well stocked with   
 fish all the year round.  In Romsey   
 altogether there are nine lakes       
 well stocked with roach, trout and    
 many other types of fish.  In Romsey  
 all the fish are in good condition in 
 rivers. If fish are caught and not    
 being put back the owners of the      
 rivers stock their fish in the rivers 
 at least twice every year.  Another   
 hobby in Romsey is bmxing and nearly  
 all the kids in Romsey have a bmx for 
 their own.  There also is a track for 
 them to go on in Viney Avenue.  It is 
 good because it keeps them off the    
 roads and it keeps them out of        
 trouble.
