		<content> NEAR WHERE WE LIVE THERE IS A GATE    
 CALLED STAG GATE THAT IS ON THE A31   
 WHICH RUNS FROM WIMBORNE TO DORCHESTER
 .THESE DAYS OUR SORTS OF TRANSPORT ARE
 CARS,LORRIES,BUSES AND VANS.MOST      
 FAMILYS HAVE CARS AND IT IS SOMETIMES 
 DIFFICULT TO GET TO SCHOOL AT 3.15PM  
 BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY CARS PARKED 
 OUTSIDE.WE HAVE A CAR WHICH WE CALL   
 VIOLET.WE ALSO HAVE A VAN IT USED TO  
 BE A POSTAL VAN BUT MY FRIEND BOUGHT  
 IT AND HE GAVE IT TO MY DAD.SOME ROADS
 HAVE THINGS WHICH ARE PLACED IN THE   
 MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AT NIGHT WHEN      
 LIGHTS SHINE ON THEM THE LIGHT IS     
 REFLECTED SO THEY LOOK BRIGHTER AND   
 THEY HELP YOU TO FIND YOUR WAY.
