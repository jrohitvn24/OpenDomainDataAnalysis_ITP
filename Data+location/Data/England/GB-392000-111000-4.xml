		<content> The population of this area (some 300 
 households) forms a rich variety.Being
 such a pleasant, rural area many of   
 the houses are bought as retirement   
 homes or by people from the           
 professional classes which gives a    
 fairly high average age and something 
 of an imbalance.                      
 These are the folks who can afford to 
 maintain thatched roofs etc and give  
 the properties that 'well heeled'     
 appearance which then puts them out of
 th reach of the pocket of most young  
 families of lesser means.             
 Many people commute daily to          
 Bournemouth, Poole, Salisbury and     
 Wimborne or are employed in farm or   
 estate work.                          
 There is a small car repair workshop  
 at Marlborough Farm, an agricultural  
 engineer and small garage at Tarrant  
 Hinton.                               </content>
