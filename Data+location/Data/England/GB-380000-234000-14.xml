		<content>  This  was  held on Sept. 7th. and was
 organised for  the first time  by  the
 village hall management committee. The
{standard}of the entries was  generally
{good, }but the  number of{ flowers and
{vegetables} reflected the {poor summer
 of 1985.  Contributors  had  made more
 cakes and pies, as if to compensate.  
  Classes included  packed lunch-boxes,
 plants, flower arrangements, craftwork
 and  winemaking.   There  was  also  a
 childrens section.                    
{ Cups and trophies}were awarded:   The
{Parish Cup}for the{overall winner;}the
{Runners - up  Cup,} donated  by  local
 families;  the {Hillworth Cup}for best
{vegetable; }the{Cottagers Cup}for best
{produce;    The  Flower  Bowl;    the 
{Applewick Trophy} for {children's work
 and the{Quincey Trophy }for {craftwork
 and{photography.
