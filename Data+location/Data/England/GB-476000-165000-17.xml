		<content>  We did a survey into a typical day in
 the life of a child in the Barkham    
 area.The results were as follows.The  
 typical weekday consists of           
 having breakfast and then preparing   
 for school.School takes up most of the
 day and when the children arrive home 
 they go out to play with their        
 friends.After arriving home and having
 tea/dinner,they usually watch a good  
 deal of television before bed.At the  
 weekend children usually watch        
 television for a while and after      
 changing they go to town shopping     
 which is usually unpopular.When they  
 come home they often go out to play   
 then come home they often go out to   
 play then they have tea and watch     
 television before bed.
