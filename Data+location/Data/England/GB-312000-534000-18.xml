		<title>18TRANSPORT in Blindcrake</title>
		<content>   Blindcrake is situated on a cut-off 
 oxbow on the main ex Roman road from  
 Carlisle to Papcastle (near Cocker-   
 mouth). Transport of one kind or      
 another is almost essential if other  
 areas are to be visited as earlier in 
 the year the four times a day, six    
 days a week bus service was cut to two
 a day on Mondays and Fridays only     
 (Cockermouth market day is Monday).   
   Most villagers own a car, others use
 bicycles, mopeds, motorbikes, vans and
 tractors to get to work.              
   Apart from the main Carlisle-       
 Cockermouth road all other roads are  
 minor, usually only 10 feet wide. Most
 traffic is local and is often held up 
 by animals being transferred from one 
 field to another or to the farm to be 
 milked.
