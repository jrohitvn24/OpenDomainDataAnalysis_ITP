		<content> There are many different means of     
 travel in our area.The main transport 
 we use are cars.We see lorries, vans  
 and motor bikes in this neighbourhood.
 City Transport buses travel to and    
 from Southampton and around the       
 outskirts of the city.In Woolston     
 there is a small train station at     
 which some trains travelling between  
 Portsmouth and Southampton. Outside   
 our area is Southampton (Eastleigh)   
 airport.We sometimes see planes flying
 overhead between the city airport and 
 the Channel Islands or the continent. 
 We did a survey to discover how people
 in our class travel to school-:
