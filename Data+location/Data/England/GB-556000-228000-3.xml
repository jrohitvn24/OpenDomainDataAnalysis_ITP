		<content> This is mainly undulating farmland    
 with small woods and streams. The     
 source of the River Chelmar, close to 
 that of the Cam, can be traced, also a
 tributary, the Starr Brook. There are 
 several ponds, fed by springs, 2      
 moated houses and reservoirs excavated
 probably since the drought of 1976.   
 ChickneySt Mary's Church contains     
 traces of pre-conquest work. One of   
 the ancient windows is in the north   
 wall of the nave. The church was      
 extended in the 13th, 14th &amp; 15th     
 centuries. It was struck by lightening
 in 1902 and restored. The churchyard  
 is listed as a site of special        
 scientific interest on account of its 
 rare wild flowers. Horham Hall built  
 1502-60 incorperating part of a half  
 timbered house dating from 1476, it   
 was restored 1840-50 &amp; in 1976. Queen 
 Elizabeth 1 stayed here in 1571 &amp; 1578</content>
