		<title>15Trowell-Festival village</title>
		<content> Trowell is an old settlement dating   
 back to the 10th Century so that by   
 1066 it was a well developed parish.By
 the beginning of the 13th Century coal
 was being worked in Trowell Moor to be
 sent to Nottingham and stone was also 
 extracted as building material,some of
 which was used in Nottingham Castle.  
 Nottingham Canal was cut in the 18th  
 Century.The railway was laid in 1845, 
 the link to Radford which cuts across 
 the bottom third of the D'Block was   
 laid in 1878.The M1 motorway which    
 bisects the village north to south was
 laid in 1966 and contains the Granada 
 Service Station.In 1951 Trowell was   
 Britains Festival Village,chosen as a 
 typical English rural community.      
 Trowell is essentially a rural        
 area,most of the land being devoted to
 agriculture.The focal point of the    
 village is where 3 main roads join.   </content>
