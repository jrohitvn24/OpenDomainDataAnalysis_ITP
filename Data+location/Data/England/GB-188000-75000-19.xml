		<title>19PADSTOW REGATTA</title>
		<content> Padstow has had a Regatta for many    
 years and many of the events are long 
 standing.Various races are organised  
 including sailing,single-oar sculling,
 board-sailing and the fishing boat    
 race.There are also{fun events}like a 
 greasy pole competition to see who can
 stay on the longest, the best-dressed 
 fishing boat and a raft race.No one   
 sticks to the rules in the{raft race  
 and most competitors end up covered in
 flour,desperately clinging to their   
 raft which everyone else appears to be
 trying to overturn.There are          
 competitions for children to draw     
 chalk pictures on slate and catch     
 crabs.Displays are mounted by the     
 local Sea Cadets and Canoe Club, and  
 the highlight of the day is a         
{simulated rescue}involving  Padstow   
 lifeboat,a R.A.F.Nimrod and a R.A.F.  
 helicopter.                           </content>
