		<title>07The Village Hall</title>
		<content> Every Monday afternoon a room in the  
 hall is opened which holds a library  
 for the locals.When asked the         
 villagers were all pleased with the   
 library facilities and preferred it to
 a van.Once a month a doctor attends   
 for a baby clinic. Without this the   
 nearest is 5 miles away, and with no  
 regular bus service this would mean   
 hardship for some. The hall makes a   
 lovely monthly meeting place for the  
 Senior Residents. Regular evening     
 bookings are bingo, youth club, Scots 
 Club,Women's Institute and BeeKeepers.
     August Bank Holiday sees the      
 Hanley Castle &amp; Hanley Swan 33rd      
 Annual Flower Show, which is the main 
 fund raising activity for the village 
 hall. A popular event which brings the
 villagers together and a chance for   
 them to show their skills. This year  
 the money is for painting the hall.   </content>
