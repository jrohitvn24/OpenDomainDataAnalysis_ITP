		<title>11The Hayle By_Pass</title>
		<content> Since the by_pass has been built Hayle
 has become a better place because it  
 is not so busy with traffic.The roads 
 are a lot safer to cross and the      
 noise level is down.One of the things 
 that the by_pass has improved is      
 speed of communications.Another thing 
 is that since a lot of the cars are   
 going on  the by_pass, there has not  
 been so much dust and dirt in the air.
    The people that own shops,public   
 houses and cafes are effected by the  
 by_pass because it means that they are
 losing customers.People who do bed    
 and breakfast are also losing trade,  
 people who are tired and want to stay 
 the night now drive passed on the     
 by_pass.                              
   Wild flowers have already           
 established themselves on the verges  
 and look lovely.
