		<title>03Employment in Chilton area.</title>
		<content>   Spennymoor, four miles to the north 
 east of Chilton, with factories making
 houeshold electrical appliances, such 
 as washers, cookers, freezers, micro- 
 wave ovens and power tools also has a 
 lot of Chilton people working there.  
   Other places further afield that    
 employ people from Chilton include    
 Bishop Auckland, Darlington and Durham
 City.                                 
   Our own industrial estate at Chilton
 has specially built factory units that
 house a wide range of interests       
 including light engineering, window   
 making, chemical cleaner manufacture  
 and pet food manufacture. Some        
 factories are still being built on    
 this estate and it is hoped that they 
 will bring more employment to the     
 area.                                 
   Most of the area is farmland but    
 only few people work on the land.     </content>
