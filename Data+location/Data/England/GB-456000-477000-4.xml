		<content>    Today the Coxwold-Gilling Gap still
 remains very beautiful, untouched by  
 industry, towns, cities, modern       
 housing and technology. If we could   
 take an aerial view of it, it would   
 stand out as a patchwork of fields,   
 green for the lush meadows, and golden
 yellow for the ripened corn ready to  
 be harvested. Also we could see the   
 old farms and barns situated in the   
 middle of their lands. As well as that
 the large oak trees and deciduous     
 woods would stand out as patches of   
 thick green foliage.                  
    It is important that we preserve   
 this area and save it for as long as  
 we can from the steel jaws of industry
 or we will forget what the countryside
 is. It is for this reason that the    
{Howardian Hills}are to be declared an 
 area of outstanding beauty.
