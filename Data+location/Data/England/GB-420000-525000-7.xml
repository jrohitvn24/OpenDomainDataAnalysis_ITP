 bars and lounges.My Dad is the        
 entertainment organiser who books all 
 of the acts and looks after them when 
 they arrive. On Saturdays the organist
 comes to play for the ballroom        
 dancers. During the week you can play 
 bingo and have a drink with your      
 friends.The lounge is only opened on  
 Saturday nights and Sunday mornings   
 and evenings. There is a juke box in  
 the lounge so you can play pop music  
 or old-time music,but most people who 
 go to the Club prefer pop music.The   
 Club has a lot of members, they prefer
 to go there rather than to the pubs   
 because it is{convenient and the }
