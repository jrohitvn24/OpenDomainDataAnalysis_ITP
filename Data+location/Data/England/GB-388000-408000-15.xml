      The railway line from Manchester 
 to Leeds passes through Castleton.    
      It was opened in 1839, and the   
 entance to the station was opposite   
 the Director's Inn in the village     
 centre. The Inn took its name from the
 fact that the directors of the railway
 used to hold meetings and dinners     
 there.                                
      At first, passengers going       
 westwards to Heywood and Bury had to  
 travel by canal barge but later a     
 railway line was built and the barge  
 was converted into a public house in  
 another part of Rochdale called       
 Belfield.                             
      The name of the station was      
 changed to Castleton in 1875 and the  
 present station was opened in 1877.
