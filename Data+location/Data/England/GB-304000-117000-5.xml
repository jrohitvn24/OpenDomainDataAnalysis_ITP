		<content> All of the children that I know have  
 bicycles .We ride over to see our     
 friends at evenings and weekends.Some 
 of the pupils at our school come by   
 mnibus if they live out in the        
 country.Mr.Kerslake owns and drives   
 this.He lives in Holcombe.All of our  
 families own cars.I think that most   
 families that I know have 2 cars.There
 is a bus which goes to Tiverton twice 
 a day from Westleigh,Burlescombe and  
 Holcombe Rogus.This is run by         
 Kingdom's.A bus goes to Taunton twice 
 a week.A bus run by Blue Venture takes
 the children to Uffculme School.The   
 Grand Western Canal is about a mile   
 from our school.The main railway line 
 to London goes through one corner of  
 our area.We can see the trains coming 
 out of White Ball tunnel from one of  
 our classroom windows.
