		<content>      To the east is the River         
 Parrett and the Bridgwater to Taunton 
 canal- they both flow through farmland
 and the town of Bridgwater.           
     The canal is no longer used       
 commercially because it is too slow a 
 method of transportation, Motorways   
 and the railway network are a more    
 speedy and economic way of delivering 
 goods.  Because it has fallen into    
 disuse, wild life abounds along its   
 banks. The River Parrett is also not  
 used commerically in this area.       
    A new pumping station built in l979
 on the edge of the river comes into   
 action when Stock Moor Rhyne becomes  
 too full pumping water into the River 
 Parrett.                              
   This is a new industrial estate     
 which is still developing.
