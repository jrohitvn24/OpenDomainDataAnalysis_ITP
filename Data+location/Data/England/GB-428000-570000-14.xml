		<title>14   TRANSPORT.</title>
		<content>In this area there are 3 main types of 
transport.There are cars,buses and the 
Metro.                                 
BUSES.:The buses in this area are      
yellow and white in colour.Most of the 
buses are single deckers,although a few
are double deckers.The majority of     
buses are "Pay as you enter".          
METRO.:This is a modern system of      
transport for the area.It links with   
buses from North and South of the River
Tyne in order to transport people in   
and out of Newcastle.The "trains" run  
regulary(every ten minutes)and use     
electricity to power them.Because of   
this they can be said to be "Pollution 
Free".                                 
CARS.:Most people have cars to travel  
to and from their work,however the     
public transport system is regular and 
very reliable.
