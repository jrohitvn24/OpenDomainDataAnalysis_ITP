		<title>14Silver Jubilee in Highworth.</title>
		<content> Many people remember the Queens'      
 Silver Jubilee on the 7th of June     
 1977. In Highworth there were stalls  
 selling souviners and all the children
 under 12 got Jubilee mugs at half     
 price. In the afternoon there were    
 some games for the children like      
 football,running and fancy dress      
 competitions. They also had tea and   
 cakes. In the evening the old people  
 danced to the music of the Highworth  
 Silver Band.There was a parade of     
 floats going round Highworth. Each    
 float represented a year of the Queens
 reign. There were decorations all     
 round Highworth,there were street     
 parties everywhere.It was a thoroughly
 memorable day.Because of it the High  
 Street was closed down and the traffic
 came to a standstill for a time.
