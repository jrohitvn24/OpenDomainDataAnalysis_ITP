		<content> I began my questionaire in Chestnut   
 Way where they considered the postal  
 service to be fair to good. The       
 people did not mind about this but    
 they said that the postal service was 
 not as good as it was 50 years ago.   
 The next morning the telephone        
 service was considered. People thought
 that it was generally good but some   
 thought that there was some inertia   
 about changes. The nearest telephone  
 kiosks were at the 'Cross' and were   
 thought to be temperemental or        
 probably vandalised.                  
 We then considered Television. About  
 half of those questioned liked video  
 recorders, videos and television      
 although Repton seemed more interested
 in these things than Newton Solney.   
 Cable television was considered to be 
 'American' and not necessary. Most    
 said there were too many commercials. </content>
