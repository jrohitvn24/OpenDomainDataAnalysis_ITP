		<title>04Kirtlington Park</title>
		<content>Kirtlington Park is surrounded by trees
and the remains of a wall. There is a  
big house in the park and it was built 
in 1741/48. At the moment Mr. Buxton   
owns it and lives in part of it. The   
rest is rented to other people. There  
is also a polo ground which has games  
most Sundays between May and September.
Most years Prince Charles comes to     
play. Every year there are several fox 
hunts. On the edge of the park is a    
lake about 2.5 acres in size. The park 
covers 274 acres of landscape. It is   
not open  to the public. The first     
people to live in Kirtlington Park were
Sir James and Lady Dashwood and their  
family. Sir James must have been very  
rich because his house was one of the  
finest in the county. At the entrance  
to the park are two stylish green      
gates. The park is mainly grazing land 
for cattle and horses.                 </content>
