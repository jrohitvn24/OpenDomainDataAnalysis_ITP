		<title>19A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> My name is Clair Louise Booth and I   
 am 8 years old and I start my day by  
 being woken by my mum at 7:30.I always
 stay in bed for another quarter of an 
 hour because I am lazy.When I get up I
 put on my school uniform:-a blue skirt
 ,a blue and white T-shirt anda grey   
 cardigan and then I have my breakfast.
 After breakfast I go outside to feed  
 my pet guinea-pig Annabell then I come
 inside and brush my hair,clean my     
 teeth and walk to school.The teacher  
 takes the register which is a long    
 list of all the people in the class.  
 After register we line up to go into  
 assembly.Assembly ends at 9:20 and we 
 go back to our classroom. At 12:00 we 
 have lunch.After lunch we read until  
 1:30.Then group 1 for swimming get    
 changed and vice versa we go home at  
 3:30.                                 
                                       </content>
