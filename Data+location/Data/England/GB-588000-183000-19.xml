		<title>19Southend:Bank Holidays</title>
		<content>   {Southend's Bank Holiday Mondays    
 have a reputation throughout the      
 country and often make front page news
 in the Natonal Press the following    
 day.                                  
    On the Bank holiday all the groups 
 such as the Mods,Casuals,Skinheads and
 Rockers descend on Southend,in        
 particular onto the Seafront,and have 
 large riots or fights,often with the  
 police.                               
    The children interviewed some of   
 these groups.The casuals said that    
 they often spent Â£30 on shoes,and over
 Â£150 on complete outfits.They         
 especially wear clothes with expensive
 brand names.                          
    The Town is often vandalised by    
 these groups on Bank Holiday Mondays  
 and British Rail lay on special trains
 for the groups to travel into         
 Southend.                             </content>
