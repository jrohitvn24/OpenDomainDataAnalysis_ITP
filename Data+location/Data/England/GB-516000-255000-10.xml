		<title>10PEOPLE OF LITTLE BARFORD.</title>
		<content>  Then Mrs Morris told us about        
 Nicholas Rowe.He was the poet Laureate
 for Queen Anne from 1715 until he died
 in 1718 he had been born in Little    
 Barford and the cottage in which he   
 had lived was taken down a few years  
 ago and rebuilt in{Glatton}near{      
{Peterborough.}It was bought by a Mr   
 West who happened to be passing when  
 the workman started to take it        
 down.After talking to Mrs Morris we   
 made our way to Mr Smith's            
 cottage.There we met Mrs Smith and    
 made arrangements to see Mr Smith at a
 later date.We then walked along a     
 private road on the{Alington Estate}  
 which took us under a railway bridge. 
 After several minutes of walking and  
 looking at the crops we turned round  
 and went back to the car, and then    
 back to school.
