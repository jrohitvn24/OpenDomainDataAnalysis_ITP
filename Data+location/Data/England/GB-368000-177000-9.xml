		<title>09THE NEW INN,WESTERLEIGH</title>
		<content>   We are fascinated to see that       
 Westerleigh has a{"New Inn" and "Ye   
{Olde Inne"}.The landlord,only there   
 for 18 months so far,does not know how
 old the building is but{it does not   
{look very new to us!}He really enjoys 
 his work and sees it more as a        
 relaxing social life.                 
  {Mondays and Saturdays are the       
{busiest times}and the landlord spends 
 a lot of time preparing food for{bar  
{snacks}and the{restaurant}.In winter  
 he finds that most of the customers   
 are local people but in the summer    
 more people visit from elsewhere .He  
 says that the more people drink the   
 funnier they act and he sometimes has 
 to ask them to leave early.           
   When we visited the pub the record  
 player was on very loud and{people    
{seemed to be enjoying themselves.
