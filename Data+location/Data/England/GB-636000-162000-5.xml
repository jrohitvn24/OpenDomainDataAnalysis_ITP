		<content>Locally the education system is still  
based on selection at 11 for grammar or
secondary school.In our area,Chilton is
mixed junior &amp; infants,Priory Road is  
an infant school &amp; Christ Church is a  
junior school.When the children reach  
the age of 11,they take a test &amp; the   
results,when taken with other criteria,
decide the 25% who shall go to grammar 
schools.In this area is Clarendon House
Girls Grammar School.Other Grammar     
schools are Chatham House Boys &amp; Dane  
Court.   Generally children start      
school at the age of 5 and leave at 16.
The basic subjects are Mathematics and 
English,but increasing emphasis is now 
being put on science,environmental     
studies and computers.Most primary     
schools have at least one computer and 
eventually there will be one in every  
classroom.Costs are rather high at the 
moment but parents help financially.   </content>
