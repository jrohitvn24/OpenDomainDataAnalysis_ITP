		<title>18PLAYGROUND GAME</title>
		<content> 'ONE HAD,ALL HAD'                     
 You can play this game nearly         
 anywhere.You need two places for      
 'homes' and about 6 people.Then you   
 decide who will be 'on it'(they       
 catch people).Then all the people who 
 are not 'on it' go to a 'home'.Next   
 everyone else tries to go back and    
 forth.When you get 'had'(caught),you  
 have to help the person who has caught
 you.When everyone has been 'had',the  
 process begins again with the 'had'   
 person,who was first 'on it'.There are
 different rules;you can make chains by
 holding hands and stretching from     
 'home'.You can have countdowns;when   
 you are in the 'home' for a long time,
 the person 'on it' counts down from 1O
 to O and if you are not out before    
 O,you help catch others.
