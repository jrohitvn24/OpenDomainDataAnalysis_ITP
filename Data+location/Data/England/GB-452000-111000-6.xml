		<title>06The Local Vicar.</title>
		<content>  The vicar of Shedfield, Mr.G.Morrell,
 is also Rural Dean of Shedfield and   
 Curdridge. He has been a vicar for 15 
 years and trained at London University
 where he studied Theology for 3 years.
 He trained for the priesthood at St.  
 Boniface College, Warminster. His     
 training continued for the first 3    
 years of being a vicar.               
   The 39 yr. Mr. Morrell has been     
 married for 15 yrs. &amp; has 3 children. 
 Before he became vicar of Shedfield he
 spent a year in Kenya and 7 years in  
 Havant. He thinks that God doesn't    
 work like a telephone but he senses   
 that God has a part in his life, like 
 guiding him in his mind to make the   
 right decisions. He finds his work    
 hard to cope with at times because he 
 has to use a kidney machine twice     
 weekly.
