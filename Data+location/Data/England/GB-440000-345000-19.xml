		<title>19THE OPENCAST SITE (TWO)</title>
		<content> He moved from Barnsley to get the job.
 After the opencast site is finished   
 they will regrass the area and return 
 it to farmland,though it will be a    
 number of years before it can be used 
 for arable crops. The limited time    
 that they can work is from seven in   
 the morning to seven  at night.       
 People have complained and protested  
 about the noise, pollution, and the   
 ugly scenery of the opencast.The large
 waste tips dominate the landscape     
 of the area.To overcome complaints    
 assurances were given that everything 
 was being done to cut down on the     
 noise and dust. People have also      
 protested about the opencast site not 
 being put back to its natural beauty  
 but it is promised that when mining is
 completed people will not be able to  
 tell that the opencast had been there.
 This is not true for other areas.     </content>
