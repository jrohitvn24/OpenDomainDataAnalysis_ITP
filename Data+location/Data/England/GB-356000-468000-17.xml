		<content>The small village of Gressingham is    
situated on the West bank of the River 
Lune some 2 km from Hornby. The two    
villages are connected by a road which 
spans the river at the Loyne Bridge, a 
single track width:-proceed with       
caution!                               
Gressingham's inhabitants are clustered
together around the church and the     
whole village appears to cling to the  
hillside on which it is situated. There
are no amenities in the village; the   
residents have to travel to shop,      
attend school, collect pensions, etc.  
There is a small unlicensed restaurant 
which is well known locally for its    
roast duckling!                        
Gressingham's 150 inhabitants are      
suitably proud of their village because
in July 1985 they won the small        
villages section of Lancashire's Best  
Kept Village competition.              </content>
