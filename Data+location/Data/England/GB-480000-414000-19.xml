		<title>19Religion in Luddington</title>
		<content> Services are not generally well       
 attended with as few as 3,but usually 
 15 to 20 regular attenders.The major  
 festivals are all fairly well attended
 with approx.60 to 70 attending        
 Easter,Harvest Festival and Christmas 
 Services.                             
  Recently the church building has been
 improved with electricity replacing   
 oil lamps five years ago and complete 
 redecoration  by a Manpower services  
 group last year.                      
  Unfortunately expenses are no longer 
 met by the weekly collections and     
 outside events  have to be held to    
 raise funds.The major one in          
 Luddington is the "Rose Queen Fete"   
 which is held in June.However,the     
 church has received many gifts in the 
 form of altar linen,brasses and       
 tapestry hassocks recently.
