		<title>04    THE LOCAL PUB</title>
		<content>                                       
     The only pub in the village of    
Yelvertoft is about 200 years old. The 
new owner has only been in residence   
since January 1985. The pub is at its  
busiest from 1.00 o'clock in the       
afternoon and  from 8.00 o'clock in    
the evening. The landlord would like   
to see more entertainment like discos  
and dances, he has found that          
Yelvertoft is busier than he thought   
it was going to be.
