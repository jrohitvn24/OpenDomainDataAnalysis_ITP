		<content> In Joel street there's a place called 
 Flag cottage.It's name comes from the 
 flag it used to fly during World War1.
 It was first called Spring cottage    
 when it was a private school in the   
 years before 1914.It dates back to    
 the 18th century.In the 19th century  
 many Eastcote houses were farmland.now
 a lot of the old houses don't have    
 farmland.Now the farmland is a number 
 of roads or council estates.Farms     
 which are now old buildings are:Fore  
 Street Farm, Fore St,Park farm and    
 Field End Farm ,Field End Rd and      
 Cuckoo Farm,Cuckoo Hill Rd.Haydon     
 Hall Farm in Joel St.,now called      
 Farmlands,is now a council estate.    
 Cheney St. Farm in Cheney St. is now  
 an estate of bungalows.Even though    
 many farms have sold their land Joel  
 St. Farm, Joel St. has retained its   
 land and is a working farm.           </content>
