		<title>01The Village in the Valley</title>
		<content> Bures sits astride the Suffolk Stour  
 in a valley where road and rail run by
 the river, in an arable landscape     
 dotted with deciduous trees and water 
 meadows.  As road meets river are     
 church, post office, inns and doctors 
 surgery, primary school, antique shops
 and baptist chapel, food shops and    
 newsagents.  Of the 1400 population,  
 many commute to London and East       
 Anglian towns - others work in our    
 cheese factory and agricultural seeds 
 business.  Very few work on farms.    
 Silk weaving and light industry employ
 many.  nearby is "Chapel Barn", 13th  
 century private chapel of the De      
 Tanis-now re-consecrated and dedicated
 to St Stephen, after secular use.  It 
 is the legendary site of the          
 coronation of St Edmund, patron saint 
 of England.
