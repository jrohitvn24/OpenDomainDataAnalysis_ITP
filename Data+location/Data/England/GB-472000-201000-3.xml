		<content> Feelings about growth and 'belonging'.
   A survey was made was made by two   
  Mill Lane Primary School classes.    
 Most children and parents would not   
 like to see Chinnor expand further;   
 many people felt that the village had 
 grown too quickly and was too large.  
   Although the greater part of Chinnor
 was built during the last twenty      
 years, bringing with it an influx of  
 newcomers, there seems little         
 resentment from the long-standing     
 villagers. In fact, a very strong     
 community feeling has developed and   
 the social life illustrates this.     
   In the two smaller villages of      
 Sydenham and Emmington there is a     
 strong feeling of 'belonging' both    
 among newcomers and native residents. 
 Some of the latter appear             
 hardly affected by changes taking     
 place in more urban areas.            </content>
