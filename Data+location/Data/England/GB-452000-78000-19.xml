		<title>19Childrens' views of Wroxall.</title>
		<content>  I like Wroxall because the pub has   
 got swings and a slide and a frame.My 
 Dad goes in the garden and lets me    
 drink his beer.                       
         *******************           
  I have just come back to Wroxall from
 Newcastle and I like it better.A lot  
 of things have changed.For instance   
 next door's garden has changed because
 she had nettles but now they're all   
 getting chopped down.I'm sad because I
 used to play in them.                 
         *******************           
  I like our secret camp.We only have  
 to cross our part of the stream and   
 walk through the bushes.Sometimes we  
 make camp fires to warm outselves.    
         *******************           
   I take my dog for walks.He pulls and
 he chases rabbits and pheasants.      
          ******************           
  I do not like towns-they're not nice.</content>
