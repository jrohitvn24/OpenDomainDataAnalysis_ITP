		<title>10NIGHT LIFE IN LUTTERWORTH</title>
		<content>      I am Kate Johnson.  I live in    
 Lutterworth and I am a 13 year old    
 girl.  There is not much to do in     
 Lutterworth that doesn't cost a lot of
 money.  Normally I get home from      
 school at about 4 p.m.  On Mondays I  
 stay in and do my{homework}or listen  
 to music.  Tuesdays I go to{Guides}and
 I have to wear a blue uniform.  We do 
 lots of activities.  On Wednesdays I  
 go to{Youth Wing,}where we can        
 dance or play table tennis.           
      I am Karina Ward and I am 13     
 years old.  I live in Ullesthorpe, a  
 small village 3 miles from            
 Lutterworth.  There are no clubs      
 worthwhile in my village for a        
 teenager so I visit Lutterworth a lot.
  I play badminton on a Friday night.  
 Visits to Lutterworth are fewer in    
 winter due to bad weather and darker  
 nights.                               </content>
