		<title>03AFFORESTATION AT ABLINGTON</title>
		<content> When the airfield used during World   
 War 2 was handed back to private      
 ownership it presented a problem for  
 the farmer, as it was impossible to   
 remove the large volume of concrete.  
 It was solved by breaking up the      
 concrete at planned intervals and     
 planting larch, spruce and beech. The 
 fast growing conifers are gradually   
 being thinned out, leaving the beech. 
 The newly created woods are called    
 "Foxcovert" and "Cinema Piece" where  
 the old Forces' cinema stood, and     
 together with older woodland called   
 "Dead Man's Acre" and "Spring Covert" 
 are now used for the breeding of game,
 mostly pheasants. Three of the old    
 hangars are still used for the storage
 of straw and hay.
