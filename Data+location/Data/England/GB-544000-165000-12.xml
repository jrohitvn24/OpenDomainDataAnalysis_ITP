		<title>12BLENHEIM SCHOOL, ORPINGTON</title>
		<content>{Blenheim Junior school} was opened in 
1967.                                  
Our pool was opened in 1969 and was    
covered in 1971. Altogether it cost    
over five and a half thousand pounds.  
We share it with {Goddington School}   
because they helped us to raise some of
the money.                             
When the oldest children in the school 
frst started going to Snowdon they paid
thirty-five pounds. Blenheim started   
going to Snowdon in 1973,for a week in 
every summer. In 1981 the new library  
was opened in a spare classroom. In    
1982 we started using computers. We    
have always had a sports day and Green 
team have won it most times.           
Blenheim's best football season was    
in 1975 to 1976.                       
Our headmaster designed our school     
badge and uniform.
