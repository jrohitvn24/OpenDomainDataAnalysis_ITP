		<title>07Melchbourne Village Hall</title>
		<content> The village hall plays an important   
 role in the life of Melchbourne, being
 the only public meeting place apart   
 from the church.                      
 The original hall was a wooden        
 building that burnt down in 1960.     
 During the 2nd War it was used as the 
 mess for Americans billeted at        
 Melchbourne Park. There still remains 
 the concrete path, that was           
 constructed so that the men did not   
 get muddy feet.                       
 The present hall was built with       
 remaining Amenities Money from the 1st
 War and was designed by an architect  
 who used to live in the village.      
 The hall is used for many functions;  
 parish council meetings, the harvest  
 supper, parties, rummage sales and for
 half an hour each week as the village 
 post office.                          
 Villagers run the hall.               </content>
