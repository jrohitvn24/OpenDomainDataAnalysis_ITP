		<content> Mr. John Smith farms 480 acres at Ninn
 Lodge Farm.His herd of 110 cows is the
 main enterprise but he also grows     
 cereals.His land coverage is 240 acres
 of cereals,30 acres of oil seed       
 rape,25 acres of potatoes and 185     
 acres for his cattle.His is an        
 extensive farm with only three        
 employees and much machinery,although 
 he hires an extra worker at harvest   
 time and several women to hand pick   
 the potatoes.                         
 His cows eat grass in summer and      
 silage in winter and one cow can eat  
 10 tonnes of silage in one winter.When
 the calves are born,three quarters are
 sold with the remaining quarter kept  
 to replace the herd.                  
 The recent urban development has      
 reduced the size of his farm and made 
 it necessary for him to pull up hedges
 to make efficient use of his land.    </content>
