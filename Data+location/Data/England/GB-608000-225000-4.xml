		<content>   The{Winter}of 1984/85 was           
 particularly severe, with many weeks  
 of{frost &amp;snow.}Several farmers in our
 survey had to carry water by hand to  
 their livestock.                      
  {June}has been the{wettest since     
{1887.120.7mm.of rain fell.}The average
 for this month is 40mm.The cereal     
 yield could be halved due to{mildew &amp; 
{fungus.}The hay has rotted &amp; some     
 fields of potatoes have been ploughed 
 back into the soil as it was too wet  
 to lift them.In early June a freak    
{hailstorm}flattened cereals in places.
   Farmers are worried that the present
 artificially high prices for cereal   
 prices will drop.At present the Common
 Agricultural Policy of The European   
 Economic Community ensures that       
 farmers recieve payment for their     
 surpluses.There is now a European wide
{glut of cereal crops.                 </content>
