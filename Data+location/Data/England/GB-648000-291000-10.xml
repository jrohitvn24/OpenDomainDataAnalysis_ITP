		<title>10JOBS IN OULTON BROAD.</title>
		<content>In Oulton Broad most people are        
retired  but some people have jobs.    
They are lucky, but the jobs do not    
make very good money.                  
Some people have good jobs, for example
you can get very good money by working 
on the oil rigs.                       
Some people have jobs which are not    
worth doing, for example you don't get 
paid much for making calculators.      
Some people are to young to go to work 
but most are too old to work.There are 
not really many jobs left for the      
younger generation.                    
The few jobs that are left are not     
paying out much.Many more people will  
be out of work because people are being
replaced by machines to do jobs for    
them. Some people will have jobs       
fixing the machines.                   
                                       
                                       </content>
