		<title>16GIRL GUIDES</title>
		<content>  Every Monday the Guides meet at      
 Headlands School from 7.30 to 9pm.    
 The uniform is a dark blue skirt and a
 blue blouse and gold tie.Yesterday we 
 did tin can cooking.We needed a       
 candle, a tin, some bacon and lard,   
 then we cooked the bacon.             
  We have to do at least two badges a  
 year.I am doing two now.              
 I am in Snowdrop patrol with five     
 other girls.                          
  Next week we are going to have a     
 party,I am going to bake some         
 biscuits.                             
  I like guides because of all the     
 trips we go on.In September some of   
 the Guides are going to a fun day at  
 Harrogate Showground.
