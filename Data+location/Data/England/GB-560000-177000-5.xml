		<content> THE ROLE OF A COMMUNITY POLICE OFFICER
 This role is taken by both men and    
 women.It is primarily to talk to the  
 general public,including school       
 children,in order to build up good    
 police/public relations.The officers  
 concerned get to know as many people  
 as possible in a friendly way.They    
 still make use of police vehicles and 
 radios,but prefer to travel on foot or
 by bicycle.Every school has its own   
 officer who can be contacted when     
 necessary,and will visit to talk to   
 the children about road safety and    
 personal safety.They generally work   
 early shift and late shift but not    
 night shift.These police officers     
 carry radios,truncheons,warrant       
 cards,handcuffs and pocket book,but   
 are never armed.They are in constant  
 contact with their local station and  
 central control unit.                 </content>
