		<title>15Droitwich - Farming</title>
		<content> The land in the Droitwich area        
 consists of heavy clay, except for a  
 band of light soil running east/west  
 one mile south of Droitwich. On       
 average there is 25 ins of rainfall a 
 year, which is just above the national
 average.                              
 Most of the farming in this area is   
 mixed. A typical farm has much of the 
 land turned over to grass.  The       
 animals are kept fed on this.         
 Sometimes, the grass runs out so rape 
 is grown. A small amount of land has  
 wheat and barley growing on it. Cattle
 pigs and sheep are also kept on such a
 farm. Most of the lambs are           
 slaughtered but about 4 are kept for  
 breeding. The Freisan cows give milk, 
 which is collected twice a day by     
 tankers from the Milk Marketing Board.
 The pigs are sold as pork.
