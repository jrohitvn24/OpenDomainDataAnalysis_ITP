		<title>04GIRLS' DAY, RIDDLESWORTH</title>
		<content> We are twelve year old girls at a     
 boarding school. At 7.l5 we get up and
 ready for breakfast at 8.00, then     
 tidying up the dormitories.  Lessons  
 start at 9.00 after prayers in the    
 main school hall. There are nine 40   
 minute lessons every day with a half  
 hour break in the morning and one and 
 a half hours for lunch.  At break we  
 go to Pets Corner to feed our animals 
 such as hamsters, guinea pigs,        
 rabbits, rats and mice. Lessons end at
 4.25 and we have free time where we   
 play on the Adventure Playground, play
 tennis, read or talk with our friends.
 At 5.15 a bell goes for prep followed 
 by tea and vespers and then we can    
 play again until bedtime at 8.35pm.   
 We can see the school nurse at the    
 surgery where we take our vitamins or 
 medicines.  Then we go to bed in a    
 dormitory with about three other girls</content>
