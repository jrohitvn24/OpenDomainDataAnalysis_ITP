 The Market Deeping police station is a
 modern building adjacent to the       
 Health Centre and library.There are 17
 policemen in the Deepings area from   
 Deeping St.Nicholas to the A.1.near   
 Stamford.In the station are the       
 sergeant's office, enquiry office and 
 lots of other rooms. Most of the time 
 is spent doing paper work and not much
 time outside.Most of the crime in     
 Deeping involves drunkenness and      
 damage to property.About 50% of crime 
 is caused by young school leavers.The 
 police officer that works in Deeping  
 St.James hardly ever works after      
 1.00 a.m.The police often visit local 
 schools to talk about road safety and 
 cycling proficiency.The transport that
 is provided is one police car that    
 covers all of Deeping .The rest ofthe 
 policemen go on foot.                 </content>
