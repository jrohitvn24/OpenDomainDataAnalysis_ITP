		<title>08HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  The school was founded in 1645, when 
Sir John Offley left provision for two 
stone school houses. One was for boys, 
for the learning of Latin, English and 
Accounting; the other for girls, for   
the learning of English and Needlework.
The building cost was 100 pounds.Annual
salaries were paid of 30, 20, and 10   
pounds respectively to a schoolmaster, 
an usher, and a schoolmistress.        
  Little is known of the development of
the school in the 18th Century, as no  
records were kept, but in 1804 Samuel  
Stretch left money in his will for "A  
Pretty Scholar Bell."                  
  The school was rebuilt in 1876,      
shortly after the 1870 Act made educ-  
ation compulsory. A series of alterat- 
ions and additions have been made since
that time, and although a state school,
the school has retained its individual-
ity and its links with the Church.     </content>
