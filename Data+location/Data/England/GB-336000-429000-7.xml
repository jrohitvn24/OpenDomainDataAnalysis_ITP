     The Church in Wrea Green is called
St., Nicholas;  it is about 100 years  
old.   It has a small linked church at 
Ballam.   The present Vicar has been   
taking services here for 16 years.   He
has between 20 and 24 people in the    
choir.   Some of these choristers have 
sung in cathedrals all over the country
as they have a very high reputation.   
      In the church is an interesting  
reredos behind the altar which was     
brought back from Italy by one of the  
local landowning families.             
      Part of the Vicar's work is to   
visit the Hospital at Moss Side which  
is 3Km away.   This hospital is only   
small and is used for patients         
recovering from operations and long    
illnesses.   Two other ministers from  
local churches also visit the hospital.
