		<content>{Miss W.Holmes}has lived in Alsager all
 her life. In 1918, aged 5yrs. she went
 to the infants school on Bank Corner, 
 transferring to Christchurch School at
 8 years. Everyone walked to school.   
 The school bell could be heard for    
 miles. Boys wore celluloid collars,   
 the girls pinafores, black woollen    
 stocking for winter warmth and farm   
 boys wore clogs. Playing marbles, whip
 and top and skipping in the road was  
 usual as traffic was rare. Boys were  
 absent in October potato-picking.{Miss
{Holmes}went to Grammar School at 11   
 years. and later trained as a teacher.
 Returning to Christchurch in 1939, she
 found little change. Liverpool        
 evacuees joined the school in 1940.   
 Often alarmed at the sight of cows,   
 they disliked the rural life.{Miss    
{Holmes,}now retired, continues to lead
 a busy life.                          </content>
