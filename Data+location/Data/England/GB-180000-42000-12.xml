		<content> Truro is mentioned in the original    
 1086 Domesday Book, as Great Truro and
 Little Truro. The Norman Earls of     
 Cornwall built a castle, but it was   
 probably only a wooden structure and  
 did not last long. The site is still  
 called Castle Hill. In the Civil War  
 the town was a Royalist stronghold    
 until forced to surrender to Fairfax  
 in 1646. Truro's heyday was in the    
 18th Century, when it was a centre of 
 mining in the County. It had the      
 Stannary Court and Parliament, the    
 miners' regulatory bodies. There is a 
 fine legacy of Georgian architecture  
 from this period; Lemon Street is the 
 finest West of Bath. Richard Lander,  
 the famous explorer of the River Niger
 was born here. Local newspapers like  
 the West Briton, dating from the 18th 
 Century may be read in the Museum. The
 County Record Office is also in Truro.</content>
