		<content> THE EMPHASIS OVER THE YEARS BY VARIOUS
 GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN TO ENCOURAGE AN  
 INCREASE IN PRODUCTION AND THIS HAS   
 BEEN ACHIEVED WITH THE USE OF         
 CHEMICALS, FERTILIZERS, MODERN        
 MACHINERY AND TECHNIQUES. THE YIELDS  
 OF WHEAT HAVE INCREASED FROM AN       
 AVERAGE OF 2 TONS PER ACRE TO ALMOST 4
 TONS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE      
 SELLING PRICE BEING ABOUT Â£100 PER    
 TON. HORMONES AND STEROIDS ARE OFTEN  
 USED TO MAXIMISE EFFICIENCY IN BEEF   
 PRODUCTION; AN AVERAGE 500 KILO STEER 
 WOULD REALISE Â£500.  IT IS BECOMING   
 APPARENT THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES      
 WITHIN THE EEC WERE OVER PRODUCING AND
 THERE ARE MASSIVE STOCKS OF{CEREALS,} 
{DAIRY PRODUCE}AND{MEAT.} IT APPEARS   
 THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS FARMING  
 WILL HAVE TO CHANGE TO A LOWER INPUT  
 AND PERHAPS LESS EFFICIENT SYSTEMS TO 
 REDUCE PRODUCTION AND REMAIN VIABLE.  </content>
