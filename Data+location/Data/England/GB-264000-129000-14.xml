		<title>14A Loyal School Servant</title>
		<content> Gerald,as everyone knows him,is the   
 head waiter at West Buckland School.He
 has been employed by the school for 36
 years.The whole school would come to a
  halt without Gerald because there    
 would be no one to organise our meals 
 and we would all starve.              
 He has lived in his cottage for 27    
 years.He walks to work at six o' clock
 in the morning and gets home at about 
 seven-thirty in the evening.He does   
 this job because he enjoys being with 
 his friends at school.                
 In his spare time he likes to help on 
 the farm next door to his house or to 
 work in his garden,particularly       
 growing vegatables.He is very         
 interested in sport and listens to it 
 on the radio all day while at work.   
 His cottage has a thatched roof which 
 he finds very warm.The cottage needs  
 to be rethatched every 15 years.      </content>
