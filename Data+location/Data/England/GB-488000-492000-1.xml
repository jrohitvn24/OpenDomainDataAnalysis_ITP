		<title>01Southern Langdale Forest</title>
		<content>  The area is nearly all moorlnd in    
 North York Moors National Park that   
 has been planted with conifers so     
 mostly covered by Langdale forest. The
 block is relatively flat but          
 overlooked by Cross Cliff Brow to the 
 south which is the north extreme of   
 Dalby Forest. The southern part has a 
 few forms along crosscliff Beek valley
 devoted mainly to grazing sheep and to
 the west of these some moorland has   
 been maintained. The area has one     
 small road in the south serving the   
 few farms so access to tourists is    
 very restricted although the scenery  
 make it a popular area, especially to 
 walkers. Blakey Topping, a nearby     
 viewpoint can be reached on foot from 
 this block.
