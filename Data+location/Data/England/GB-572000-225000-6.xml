		<content>      On the 6th June a small group of 
 children went to visit Panfield       
 Church, which lies at one end of the  
 village, near{Panfield Hall.}The      
 vicar,{Rev Ronald Oswald}showed us    
 around.                               
      The church was built in{1277}on  
 the site of another church. It        
 contains several graves of the{Cotton 
 and{Langham}families who lived at     
{Panfield Hall}in the 16th century. The
 east window replaces one blown out by 
 a land-mine in the 2nd World War when 
 most of the glass in the church was   
 destroyed. The organ-chamber and      
 vestry were added in the 19th century.
     {Sunday school}meets 3 weeks a    
 month at 10a.m.,{Holy Communion}at 8  
 or 11a.m. and{Morning Prayer,}once a  
 month at 11a.m.                       
      Each year a{Parish Fete}is held  
 in the grounds of{Panfield Hall.      </content>
