		<content> Many acres of level farmland lie      
 between the Kent estuary and the peat 
 mosses and conifer plantations of     
 Meathop and Foulshaw. Much of this    
 area was cleared and stripped of      
 surface peat over 200 years ago, and  
 Meathop Marsh was later formed by the 
 drainage of estuary silt after the    
{Furness Railway}opened in 1857.       
 Towards the north-west, Ulpha Fell, a 
 rocky outcrop of Silurian mudstone,   
 rises to 147'.                        
 The farms are chiefly devoted to dairy
 produce. Many large, enclosed fields  
 are grazed by milk cattle - mainly    
 Friesians. Abundant fodder is         
 produced. The fields are frequently   
 fertilized or re-sown. Sheep graze,   
 particularly on parts of Ulpha Fell,  
 and damson trees round the farmhouses 
 provided a small seasonal cash crop.
