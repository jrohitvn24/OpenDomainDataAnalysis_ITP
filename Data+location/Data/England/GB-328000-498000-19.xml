		<content>    The Northern Parishes Water Supply 
 Scheme, opened in 1973, is centred on 
{Levers Water}and{Coppermines Valley.  
 Water is treated and stored at the    
 Paddy End works, at the rate of 13630 
 cubic metres per day, to supply       
 villages from Wray in the north-east  
 to Broughton Beck in the south-west.  
    The high mineral content of the    
 water is reduced by adding soda ash;  
 filtration and chlorination then      
 permit the water to be distributed.   
    In no way has the scheme adversely 
 affected the landscape, and an        
 important water-gathering function    
 has been given to the fells in        
 addition to their traditional uses.   
 During the drought of 1984 this area, 
 unlike most of the region, had no     
 restrictions imposed on water usage - 
 mainly due to the large catchment area
 serving a relatively small population.</content>
