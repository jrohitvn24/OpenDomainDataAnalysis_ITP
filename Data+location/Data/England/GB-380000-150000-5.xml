		<content>  'Last  Saturday  ( May  14 )  it  was
 village day... at the  Village Hall. I
 went in fancy  dress. I dressed  up as
 Barbara Woodhouse.My sister was in the
 maypole  dancing. The P.T.A.  were  in
 charge  of the  school  sweet stall-it
 was  yellow  with a  big blue umbrella
 over  it. The  majorettes  came  in  a
 coach. They had two dogs which sat and
 watched...There was also a fire engine
 which you could go  on and the fireman
 kept putting on the radio.'           
                                       
  'Most years we  have a talent contest
 in the Village Hall. The children sing
 and  dance  or  do other things to see
 who is the best. I  won  a  pound  for
 singing  'Doh a Deer'  our school sang
 and won a prize.                      
  I was also in  'The Snow Queen' I was
 an Elf and a snowflake'
