		<title>12Bus Services</title>
		<content> As part of our project we looked at   
 some of the{transport}that was        
 available in our grid.We decided that 
 it would be sensible to ring{Eastern  
{National}to find out exactly which    
 services were available.              
 These were 120---Harwich Town service 
        103,104---Colchester           
        106,126---Clacton              
             80---Small town,Colchester
 When we asked people if there were    
 enough services they said no,but we   
 thought that the buses were not often 
 very full,so it would cost too much to
 lay on extra ones.                    
 It seemed to us when we surveyed,that 
 except for the rush-hour,the people   
 who made most use of the buses,were   
 the young and the elderly.            
 We also thought that there should be  
 more garages,or at least one that     
 stayed open past 8-o-clock.           </content>
