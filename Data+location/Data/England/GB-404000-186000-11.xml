		<content> This section is largely a mixture of  
 open farmland and woodland with a     
 small lake and a small area of housing
 development. This provides a diversity
 of wildlife habitats - badgers, foxes,
 deer, rabbits, hares and a variety of 
 small mammals, birds and reptiles live
 here. The badger is under threat as it
 is thought to be the cause of bovine  
 tuberculosis in cattle and its numbers
 are dwindling. The foxes are hunted by
 hounds and the hares by beagles but   
 neither are in immediate danger. There
 is also duck shooting on the lake.    
 There are Roe and Muntjac deer to be  
 found in some of the woodland, these  
 have escaped from nearby parks and    
 have wandered into the area. The      
 woodland here is the remnant          
 of a much larger forest which         
 once stretched from Cricklade         
 to Malmsbury.                         </content>
