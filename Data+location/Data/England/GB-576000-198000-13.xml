		<content> My schooldays were nice and very      
 similar to what it is now. I worked in
 a leather factory. People were very   
 poor. People were very trusting when I
 was young and we never locked our     
 doors. They are buildinga a lot now   
 and taking up much of the countryside.
 I watch televison buty I belong to a  
 religion which says I must not watch  
 war films, crime or any violence. I am
 a Jehova Witness. I like plain        
 everyday food and do not drink        
 anything alcoholic. Eastham old folks 
 home was originally a rectory but     
 during the second world war children  
 were brought from East Ham in London  
 for holidays. After the war it became 
 an old folks home. It has about 30    
 residents living in extreme comfort   
 and with complete freedom to movement.
 Their every need is catered for with  
 ample staff to look after them.       </content>
