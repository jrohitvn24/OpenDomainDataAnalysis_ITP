		<content> Peaslake Stores has always been a     
 shop. It is open from 8.30_5.l5 p.m.  
 Monday to Friday and on Saturday      
 8.30_l p.m. One full time person helps
 and four part-time people. The Post   
 Office is separate from the shop but  
 Mr. Street serves both. Most people   
 who use the Post Office also buy from 
 the shop.  Mr.Street sells more       
 food than anything else, next papers, 
 then bread, then vegetables, then     
 sweets, then household items, then    
 fruit, then stationery.  Bread, papers
 and dairy produce are delivered.Other 
 groceries and goods have to be        
 collected. The shop sells many unusual
 local goods like pork sausages, smoked
 turkey, mustard and honey. The busiest
 day is Saturday. There are about 700  
 customers a week, mostly from         
 Peaslake. Orders are delivered to two 
 old people only each week.            </content>
