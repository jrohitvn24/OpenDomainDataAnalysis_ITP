		<title>17BOLD HEATH.</title>
		<content> The area that our particular group    
 surveyed was Bold Heath. It is a      
 distinct little settlement containing 
 a few houses a public house and a     
 disused school. It has an area of     
 about 0.1 km squared and is bounded by
 a triangle of roads. The settlement is
 divided by a fast main road which,    
 whilst being a main arterial, carries 
 a sufficiently low volume of traffic  
 as to be no real barrier to           
 pedestrians crossing. During our      
 survey we  did a litter count and     
 discovered that there was very little.
 Buildings within the area include an  
 ex-Shell garage now  operating as a   
 restaurant, a garden centre, a post   
 office built in 1717, a public house, 
 a disused school and about 25 houses  
 of an upper-middle class appearance.  
 The area is regarded as desirable by  
 the locals,the only drawback,the road.</content>
