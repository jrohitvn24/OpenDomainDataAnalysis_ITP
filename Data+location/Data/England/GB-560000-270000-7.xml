   In Fordham we have got a post       
 office. It is run by Mr. and Mrs.     
 Baker and they work with Mrs. Smith.  
 They sort birthday cards, post cards  
 and Christmas cards and put them in   
 little boxes for people to buy and    
 post. There are leaflets and details  
 that you can take away and keep and   
 read at home when you want to. There  
 are other things like pens you can buy
 from the post office.
