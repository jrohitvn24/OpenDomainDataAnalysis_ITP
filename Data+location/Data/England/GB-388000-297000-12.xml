		<title>12By the Canal,Wolverhampton</title>
		<content>I used to play by the canal and        
occasionally helped with the locks;but 
I never crossed over by the locks,I    
crossed over by the bridges. The canal 
is about six feet wide and very deep so
I had to be careful. Sometimes I sat   
down in the plants and watched the     
narrow boats go by and waved to the    
people on them. Some people say the    
canal is polluted and that no fish live
in it;but although it is murky,I've    
seen little sticklebacks and newts. It 
is a nice place to walk along;there are
attractive plants and lots of different
kinds of wildlife. Along the banks are 
buildings which are used for different 
things. There is a Sea Scout base,a    
caravan and boat dealer,a coal merchant
and in one place,a few feet away from  
the canal,is a school. I stopped       
playing there because the plants grew  
over the path and it became dangerous. </content>
