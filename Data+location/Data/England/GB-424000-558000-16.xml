		<title>16WILD AND CULTIVATED PLANTS</title>
		<content> We chose a square which showed a range
 of land cover and made a survey of    
 roadside wildlife and crops in nearby 
 fields. The land was varied, ranging  
 from cultivated fields to Council     
 owned grass areas near to housing.    
 There was a wide variety of wild      
 plants and flowers, many of them in   
 bloom. They included,{Cow Parsley,    
{Thistles,Bogweed,Goose Grass,Ivy and  
{Blackberries.}There were also a number
 of road side trees including          
{Oak,Sweetchestnut,Elderberry,Holly,Ash
{and Birch.}Much of the farm land was  
 rough pasture and so had{marshy grass,
{Clover and Buttercups}whereas the     
 ploughed fields were growing{Wheat,   
{Barley and Oil Seed Rape}(this is a   
 new crop which has only been grown    
 locally in the past few years. Heavy  
 through traffic has resulted in       
 roadside pollution and debris.        </content>
