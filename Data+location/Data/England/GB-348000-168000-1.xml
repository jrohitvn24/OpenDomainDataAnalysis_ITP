		<title>01BACKWELL AND FLAX BOURTON</title>
		<content> The area in question consists of the  
 villages of Backwell and Flax         
 Bourton.It is bisected by the A370    
 road which links Bristol to the       
 motorway network and the main Bristol 
 to Exeter railway line.Both are       
 dormitory villages for the city of    
 Bristol since there is only a small   
 amount of light industry and the local
 shops to provide employment.          
 The surrounding countryside is fertile
 farmland. During the last twenty years
 there has been a great deal of        
 expansion but now land for building is
 at a premium and further expansion in 
 both villages is the subject of       
 forceful debate.                      
 The links between the villages are    
 strengthened by the children from Flax
 Bourton going to Backwell for their   
 secondary education.
