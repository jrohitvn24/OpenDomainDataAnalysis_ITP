		<content>      A 100 years ago people were born 
 and lived in the same area. Today the 
 new housing in the W. part of the area
 has led to an increase in the         
 population. Some of these people have 
 moved locally whilst others have come 
 from different parts of the country or
 even a different land. A survey was   
 carried out in one class at Bentley   
 Heath School to see where the children
 were born. Of 22 children, 10 were    
 born in Soilhull, 6 in Birmingham, 1  
 in Nottingham, 1 in Chelmsford, 1 in  
 Reading, 1 in Warwick, 1 in Leicester 
 and 1 in Bridgewater. Some children   
 in the school were born in Sweden,    
 Zambia, S. Africa, America and        
 Pakistan.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
