		<title>12PEAR TREE COTTAGE</title>
		<content> On Wrenthorpe Lane there is a         
 cottage called Pear  Tree  Cottage.It 
 is a big cottage,with  two little     
 cottages joined on. The big  cottage  
 is two hundred years old and the small
 cottages are one hundred years old.The
 cottages got their name because of a  
 pear tree that was attached to the    
 front of the big cottage.The lady who 
  used to live in the cottages  before 
 I moved in,in January was called Mrs  
  Keys.When she died the tree died.We  
 have chopped the tree down now,but    
 before that lots of people picked the 
 pears off the tree.When my mum (Mrs   
 Jessop) was little she went see Mrs   
 Keys when they were just going        
 home.Mrs Keys' daughter went and got  
 some pears. Also my mum,(Mrs Dowson)  
 used to go and pick pears off the     
 tree when she went to work.
