		<title>12Religion in Crowthorne.</title>
		<content>   In 1866{"Cottage Lectures"}were held
 in the first Anglican place of worship
 in the village which was a{hay loft   
 above a bakery.Two years later a      
{Temporary Church}was "opened"in the   
 High Street.It was never consecrated, 
 which was just as well, because when  
 it was no longer needed it was wheeled
 across the road and became a shop.    
   To-day Crowthorne is served by      
{Anglican, Roman Catholic, Baptist and 
{Methodist churches and the Broadmoor  
{Hospital Anglican Chapel}- all except 
 the first two are in this sector.     
   We found that church{attendances    
 are rising, except at the Hospital    
 because there are fewer patients      
 now.The churches combine for services 
 in{Christian Aid Week, Week of Prayer 
{for Christian Unity, and the annual   
{United Service at the Hospital.       
                                       </content>
