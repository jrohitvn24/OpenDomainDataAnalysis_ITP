 and was built in the 1980s,on the     
 Burton Fields Estate.It is semi-      
 detached,has a kitchen,living room,two
 bedrooms and a bathroom.Other houses  
 on the estate have upstairs and       
 downstairs but mine is a bungalow.    
 Other street names are:Battleflats    
 Way,because it is the site of the     
 battle of{1066}and Ox Close,because   
 oxen used to be kept there.           
 My house is in Fossway and was built  
 in 1968.It has an extension built on  
 the roof.It is semi-detached,has up   
 and down stairs and has 8 rooms.Some  
 houses on the estate are detached.The 
 street names remind us that there was 
 once a{Roman }settlement here.eg.Foss 
 Way and Roman Avenue South.
