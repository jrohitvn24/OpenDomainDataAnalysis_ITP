		<title>05The Taxi &amp; the Ice Cream Man</title>
		<content>   My Dad is a taxi driver and soon he 
 is going to take someone to a wedding.
 Sometimes he goes to Southwold and he 
 has been to London over 10 times since
 he has had his business and he has    
 been to Heathrow Airport over five    
 times. He has got one car and four    
 people can fit in it.

 My Dad works as an ice-cream man. The 
 depot is at Pakefield near Lowestoft. 
 He sells Walls' Ice-cream. He goes    
 around Wrentham, Southwold, Reydon,   
 Kessingland and LOwestoft. On Sundays 
 he goes round the country. My Dad     
 knows some more ice-cream men.
