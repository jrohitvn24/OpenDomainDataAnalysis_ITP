		<content> Since 1960, new shops providing basic 
 daily provisions have been built both 
 in the village centre and in the new  
 housing estates.  Car parking next to 
 these shops is available. The         
 villagers depend very heavily on the  
 bigger centres in Gravesend and the   
 Medway Towns for the purchase of      
 higher order goods with access to them
 by bus or private car.  Large         
 supermarkets in Strood and the        
{hypermarket}at Hempstead Valley near  
 the M2 are very popular providing     
 excellent parking facilities.{Farm    
{shops}selling fresh produce have      
 become popular in recent years and    
{garages}provide an increasingly wide  
 range of goods.  Car ownership and the
 growing mobility of the population is 
 considerably affecting{shopping}      
 patterns.
