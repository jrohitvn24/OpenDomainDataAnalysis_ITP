		<content> One of Wolvey's older residents showed
 us a photograph of Wolvey's last      
 windmill being pulled down.           
 "Of course," he said,"there used to be
 plenty of{WINDMILLS}in Wolvey at one  
  time but there's not one standing    
 now.Just the name of Mill Lane        
 remains."                             
 Twelves years ago the{LANDSCAPE}was   
 changed when a row of elm trees was   
 cut down stretching from the new      
 school down to the River Anker in     
 Bulkington Road.They all had{DUTCH ELM
{DISEASE.}                             
 When the{M69 MOTORWAY}opened between  
 Ansty and Hinckley about 9 years ago  
 it made a great change in the village.
 What had been the busy A46 trunk road 
 had now been relieved of its heavy    
 lorries and traffic going between     
 Coventry and Leicester.
