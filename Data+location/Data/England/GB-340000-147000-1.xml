		<title>01REVIEW OF WEDMORE AREA</title>
		<content>   The D-block is situated on an island
 of land rising 100ft from the peat    
 levels bounded to the north by Mendip,
 limestone hills rising to 1000ft.     
   Settled since prehistory, a royal   
 area for hunting in Alfred the Great's
 time and Wedmore the centre for the   
 peace treaty with the Danes, first    
 drained by Glastonbury monks, the rich
 dairy land is dotted with villages and
 farms.                                
   Local stone builds solid houses     
 and square-towered churches enriched  
 by the wool trade, witnessed on the   
 inn sign of the Sexey's Arms. Sir Hugh
 Sexey, an Elizabethan millionaire,    
 owned an estate continuing in the     
 school's name today.                  
   Commuters using the nearby M5 have  
 swelled the rural community still     
 following country traditions and      
 customs.                              </content>
