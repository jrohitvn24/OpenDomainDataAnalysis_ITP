		<content> Monday.                               
 Back to school at 9.00a.m.            
 The bus people are always late.       
 It's Maths and English,what hard work.
 For 3.30p.m.I just can't wait.        
 I get home from school at 3.35,       
 I really am hungry,I need something to
 eat.                                  
 I go out to play until 7.00p.m.       
 Because then on T.V. it's Coronation  
 Street.                               
 Tuesday.                              
 On Tuesday at school we have singing. 
 Mrs Salt says "I will play for all of 
 you".                                 
 We all try to sing in our best voices.
 Mr Marshall our teacher loves to sing 
 too.                                  
 Home from school,feed the rabbit.     
 Play on the swing until teatime.      
 For tea it's egg sandwiches,          
 A biscuit and a drink of lime.        </content>
