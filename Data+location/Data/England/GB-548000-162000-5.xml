		<content> Marbles is a game the children play in
the spring and summertime in dry       
weather.Marbles are glass or china     
round balls that can be quite small or 
quite big.You can buy different sorts  
of marbles and they all have funny     
names.                                 
 The smallest marble you can get is a  
{Littlie Clear},it is a small glass    
marble with a colour inside.Another    
small marble is a {Littlie},this is    
made from glass with different colours 
inside.A bigger marble is a {Biggie},  
this is like a {Littlie}butis larger.  
A lovely marble is a {Biggie Clear},   
they come in many colours made from    
glass or china.An {Aggie}is a larger   
version of a {Biggie}.Last of all is   
my favourite marble called an {Aggie   
Clear},this is like a {Biggie Clear}   
but much larger.We play marbles in     
the playground at break and lunchtime. </content>
