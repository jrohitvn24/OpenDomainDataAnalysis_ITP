{Mrs Smith Head of Humanities.         
{Mr Skeet, whose literary skills were  
{invaluable in stimulating the         
{imagination of his pupils.            
{Mr Balukewicz  whose photographic     
{skills and willingness to overcome any
{obstacles in his desire to obtain the

{accurately portrayed our area on film.
{Mr Underwood, our Project Leader who  
{delegated tasks and compiled the      
{finished results.                     
{Miss Maddock, our Headmistress, in
