		<title>18Didcot Power Station.</title>
		<content>    Didcot Power Station is a large    
 coal power station. Each of the six   
 cooling towers are larger than St.    
 Pauls Cathedral and the big chimney is
 larger than the Telecom Tower.        
    Being part of the National Grid the
 station supplies electricity to the   
 south-western region and the rest of  
 the country. 16-20 train loads of coal
 arrive at Didcot each day. The coal is
 burnt to heat water to steam which    
 drives the 4 large turbines which     
 generate the electricity. The steam is
 then condensed in the cooling towers. 
 Thousands of gallons of water from the
 River Thames are used every day. The  
 water is put back in the Thames       
 slightly warmer which the fish prefer 
 so this pleases the anglers.          
    The site was landscaped to make it 
 look more acceptable. Some think that 
 the cooling tower shape is pleasing.  </content>
