		<title>16A DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> My name is Richard Dyer and I am 13   
 years old. I have one brother who is  
 15 years old. I live just outside the 
 centre of{Newcastle.}                 
 I start my{school day}at 7.00 a.m. I  
 get up, get washed and then set out   
 for my{paper round.}This normaly takes
 me until about 7.30am. Then I have my 
 breakfast and leave for school. I get 
 into town and then change buses to    
 meet my friends.                      
 I get to school and talk to my friends
 about the night before. At lunch time 
 I go out to the field and do athletics
 training as I run for the school.I am 
 a Second Year{prefect}which involves  
 looking after the sweet and drinks    
 machines.After school I do my home    
 work and the go out to play football.I
 then come in and watch television and 
 go to bed at about 11.00p.m.
