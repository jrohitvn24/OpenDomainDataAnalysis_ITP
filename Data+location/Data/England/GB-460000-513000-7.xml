		<title>07Employment in Guisborough</title>
		<content> Employment in our area has dropped    
 considerably in the last 20 years. At 
 present Cleveland has over 20% unempl.
 (2nd only to Northern Ireland in the  
 UK),&amp; Langbaurgh (our District) is    
 above the Cleveland average.          
 Unemployment for school leavers is    
 much higher than the average for      
 adults. The main local employers      
 are Blackett Hutton, a small steel    
 works in Guisborough; a clothing      
 factory owned by Burtons; and the     
 Guisborough shops.Within a 12 mile    
 radius there are the major employers  
 on Teesside, especially ICI and       
 British Steel. School leavers can join
 a 1-year YTS scheme, &amp; there are      
 several 100 16-to-18-year-olds from   
 our area on schemes ranging from hair-
 dressing to fishing to local govern-  
 ment. But many middle-aged men made   
 redundant have no such scheme.        </content>
