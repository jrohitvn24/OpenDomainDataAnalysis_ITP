but the original school was built in   
1840.It is a stone building situated on
the edge of the village.               
  The school is set on a large plot of 
land. To the front and sides of the    
building is a large tarmac playground  
which can be entered from the road by  
either a wooden gate or through a set  
of wrought iron gates.To the rear is a 
playing field with enough space for a  
large football pitch.Next to the school
is a small adventure playground with a 
two storey wooden fort.                
  Inside the school are two classrooms 
and a small assembly hall set off a    
long corridor.On the other side are    
toilets, cloakrooms and offices.Outside
in the playing field is a single mobile
classroom.
