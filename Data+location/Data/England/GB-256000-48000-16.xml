		<title>16HOUSING IN THE SOUTH HAMS</title>
		<content> These houses were built in the 1950's.
 The only new houses being built in the
 area at present are at a luxury       
 development at Membland where a few   
 very expensive (around Â£95,000),      
 detatched architect designed houses   
 are now on the market.This is  very   
 unusual in this area because the land 
 here is for prime agricultural use and
 permission for building is not granted
 very often.                           
     Although house prices are         
 generally high in the south west,in   
 the South Hams they are particularly  
 expensive.This is because more and    
 more people are moving here and       
 commuting to work,or buying houses as 
 holiday homes.There is very little    
 rented accommodation,though some      
 winter lets are available.
