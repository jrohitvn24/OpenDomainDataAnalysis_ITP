 There is very little industry in      
 Wooler.Most factories are small and   
 employ few people.Veevers are agric-  
 ultural engineers and joiners.They    
 have a workshop on Brewery Lane.Red-  
 paths specialise in transporting      
 livestock.They have a large fleet of  
 wagons and lorries and employ 43 peop-
 le.Both these are family run busine-  
 sses.                                 
   Maxway employ mostly women to pluck,
 wash,prepare,cook and pack chickens.A 
 few men are employed as managers and  
 supervisors.                          
   There is a small industrial estate  
 on the site of the old station yard.  
 Here people have set up small busine- 
 sses making furniture,dealing in waste
 paper etc. but employ few people.
