		<title>08Emmington Farming Methods</title>
		<content>   Our block contains 12 farms. They   
 employ very few people. Sheep are not 
 common, most farms being mixed-cereal 
 and dairy produce.                    
   Village Farm in Emmington produces 1
 million litres of milk per year from  
 175 cows. The milk is transported to  
 London to be made into yoghourt or for
 bottling. There are 120 acres of      
 wheat, 16 of barley. The farmer relies
 heavily on computers and modern       
 methods and produces more milk        
 now than the total previous production
 of 14 farms in the Chinnor area. Four 
 people are employed.                  
   Manor Farm in Emmington is a cereal 
 farm, having only 12 head of cattle.  
 The farmer has no sheep; he just      
 doesn't like them! Cattle are kept for
 beef. There are 50 acres of barley and
 the same of wheat. He employs 3       
 workers.                              </content>
