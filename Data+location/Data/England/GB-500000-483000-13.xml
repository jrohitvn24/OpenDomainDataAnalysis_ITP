 Farm where these two crops are grown  
 as well as grass for silage.This farm 
 also keeps 200 bullocks.This farm is  
 very well equipped as it needs to be  
 to cover its 340 acres of land.All the
 farms in this area are intensively    
 farmed as there are about 6 farms in a
 small area.All the farms have many    
 tractors,trailors,ploughs and a couple

 other being dairy.Low Eastfield Farm  
 also has a small registered caravan   
 site to help to bring in some extra   
 money.This area is extremely efficient
