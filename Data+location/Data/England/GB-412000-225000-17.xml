		<content> In this area houses are isolated but  
 the occupants said that they enjoyed  
 the peace of the countryside, their   
 main concern being the distances from 
 shops and other amenities. Transport, 
 which is seen as a necessity, is      
 expensive. The likelihood of becoming 
 snowbound in the Winter is also a     
 worry. Everyone is interested in      
 conservation. All those interviewed   
 disliked the use of metric measures in
 this country, preferring to use the   
 old English ones.
