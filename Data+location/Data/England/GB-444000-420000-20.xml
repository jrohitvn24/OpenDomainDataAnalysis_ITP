		<title>20A day in Pontefract.</title>
		<content>   This day in the life of Pontefract  
 is a market day,where food and a      
 variety of items are bought and       
 sold.It is a busy town with people    
 bustling everywhere.In the middle of  
 the market place there is a           
 Buttercross which Elizabeth Dupier had
 built in memory of her husband in     
 1734.There has been a market in       
 Pontefract for many hundreds of years 
 it was made better by making market   
 place a pedestrian precinct in 1980.  
   The names of the streets near the   
 market Beastfair,Cornmarket,          
 Shoemarket,and Ropergate tell us what 
 was sold or what was made             
 there.Northgate and Southgate were    
 entrances to the Castle.Our colourful 
 stretches to the Town Hall and        
 St.Giles Church which has been the    
 Parish Church since 1789.
