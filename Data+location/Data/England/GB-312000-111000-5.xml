		<content> There are no major roads in the area  
 of this survey. The roads are all     
 unclassified and serve the village of 
 Hemyock. There are four routes in and 
 out of the village. The most used     
 route leads west from the village,    
 following the valley of the River Culm
 to Culmstock. This route leads to     
 Exeter and Tiverton. In the other     
 direction the road leaves the village 
 to the north leading to Wellington and
 Taunton and is called Station Road.   
 There are three other routes out of   
 the village. Two of these head south  
 from the village, joining about a mile
 from the village and leading to       
 Honiton. Culmbridge Road leads to     
 Clayhidon, Churchinford, Bishops Wood 
 and eventually to Illminster. Between 
 these roads there are many minor      
 roads, some single track, connecting  
 settlements within the area.          </content>
