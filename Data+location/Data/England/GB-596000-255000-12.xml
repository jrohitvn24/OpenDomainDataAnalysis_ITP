		<title>12Buxhall - Historic Buildings</title>
		<content> 50% of dwellings (68) in the area     
 predate 1914 and the majority of these
 date from the 17th century. 27 are    
 large farmhouse type, of which 13 are 
 on working farms. Despite the number  
 of historic houses only 8 are listed  
 as{Grade II buildings}and thus have   
 some protection from changes which    
 could affect their character. The list
 of historic buildings is now under    
 revision and additions are expected.  
                                       
 Many other potentially interesting    
 buildings have suffered as a result of
{unsympathetic modernisation}eg        
 reroofing with unsuitable tiles,      
 extensions not in scale or character  
 with the original buldings.           
 There are 12 thatched houses in the   
 area, a further 5 thatches have been  
 replaced by tiles since 1950.
