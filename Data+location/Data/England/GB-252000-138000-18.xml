		<title>18MARWOOD N. LEISURE</title>
		<content>    People in this area tend to either 
 work for themselves on the land or    
 elsewhere and have large gardens, so  
 much of their time is spent in this   
 way.                                  
    Apart from the Working Men's Club  
 at Milltown which is not used at the  
 moment because it needs a lot of      
 repairs and alterations done to it,   
 and the small Plymouth Brethren Chapel
 at Middle Marwood there are no other  
 public buildings for leisure.         
    People enjoy gardening, TV and     
 following hobbies in their own homes. 
    If they want to play badminton or  
 go for a swim they have to go out of  
 the area. Children like to ride their 
 ponies and bikes. Some people like to 
 go hunting while others prefer to go  
 for a walk, camping or on the beach.  
    Adventurers and Teenagers the      
 church youth group meet here sometimes</content>
