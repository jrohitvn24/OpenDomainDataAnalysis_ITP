		<content> My name is Samantha and I am a pupil  
 at Newton Poppleford County Primary   
 School.Our school was built in 1876   
 and then it was called Harpford       
 School.There are three teachers       
 (Mr.Bolsover,Miss Baker and           
 Mrs.Griffith) and the Headmaster whose
 name is Mr.S.Kerrigan.                
 The school has 87 children(47 boys    
 and 40 girls)There are three classes  
 as the Headmaster doesn't have one.The
 children at our school are aged from 5
 to 11 and when we finish most of us go
 to Sidmouth College.                  
 The school has quite a few sports     
 facilities a playing field,football   
 pitch,a swimming pool and a hall with 
 P.E equipment.
