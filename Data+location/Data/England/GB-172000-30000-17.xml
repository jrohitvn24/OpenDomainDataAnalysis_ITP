 A local resident lives in an old      
 vicarage not far from the church.The  
 house is very large and is in need of 
 repairs.She shares the house with her 
 sister who is often abroad.Her husband
 is often abroad because of work.The   
 grounds around the house come to about
 an acre and a half.The grounds support
 a wide range of trees and undergrowth.
 The owner is called Mrs. Popple and   
 she has been living there for 18      
 months.The thing she likes most about 
 the area is that it is peaceful and   
 the countryside .There is nothing that
 she really dislikes except that it is 
 miles from shops etc.Her typical day  
 involves taking her son to school and 
 sometimes she works as a freelance    
 secretary.
