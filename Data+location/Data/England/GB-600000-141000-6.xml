		<content>After their fifth birthday the local   
children attend the Infants School     
situated in Church Road. There they    
begin to learn about letters and       
numbers and their uses. After they are 
seven they will move onto the Junior   
School. At present this has two sites, 
one in Highfield Road and the other in 
Lees Road. The school contains about   
500 children. By the age of 11 they    
should be able to read, calculate and  
communicate fluently. Most children    
then go to the Ashford Boys or the     
Ashford Girls Secondary Schools. At    
13 it can be possible, through testing 
to transfer to a higher ability school.
Children can leave at 16 to find a job 
or stay to complete their studies by   
the age of 18. Some would then move    
onto  college or university.
