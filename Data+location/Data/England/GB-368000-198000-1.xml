		<title>01THE BERKELEY AREA</title>
		<content>  The Berkeley area lies in the Severn 
 Vale between the escarpment of the    
 western Cotswold Hills and the River  
 Severn. The land is flat, river valley
 land mostly used for dairy farming.   
 None of the land is more than 30      
 metres above sea level. The main A38  
 Gloucester to Bristol road runs       
 through the eastern part of our block,
 as does the main Gloucester-Bristol   
 railway. There is a branch line which 
 runs across the north of our block    
 towards Sharpness Docks on the Severn,
 but that is for goods trains only.    
 Most of the people live in the small  
 town of Berkeley but there are small  
 villages at Ham and Berkeley Heath.   
 Two features which lie outside our    
 block but which have an important     
 influence on it are the M5 motorway to
 the east and Berkeley Nuclear Power   
 Station to the west.                  </content>
