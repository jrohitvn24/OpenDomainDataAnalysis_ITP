		<title>12TWO POST HOUSES, SHERBORNE</title>
		<content>{HISTORY:}In 17th century the Old Post 
 House was built for stages to change  
 horses and to let the passengers rest.
 The Post House was on two main roads  
 Bath to Dorchester and Exeter to      
 London. The railway superseded the    
 stage so the Post House closed down.

 to a modern design. It was completed  
 on the 20th Feb 1969. The hotel was   
 built with the best materials of the  
 time. It employs 36 staff. The sort of
 people who stay at the hotel are old  
 people, businessmen and tourists. The 
 average cost to stay a night at the   
 POST HOUSE is Â£39.00, and the average 
 cost of a meal is Â£8.95 .
