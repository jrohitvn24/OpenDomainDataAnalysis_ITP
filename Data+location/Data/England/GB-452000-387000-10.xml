 4. More girls than boys enjoy riding. 
 They also enjoy looking after the     
 animals.                              
 5. There are lots of problems in our  
 area for both riders and owners of    
 riding stables.                       
 (a) motor traffic is often            
 inconsiderate.                        
 (b) bridle paths do not always        
 interlink.                            
 (c) farmers generally find horse      
 riders a nuisance.                    
 (d) riding establishments are not     
 classed as agricultural by the        
 Government, which means they do not   
 get the same financial help as        
 farmers.                              
 (e) there is a shortage of hay because
 farmers are growing more profitable   
 crops. This pushes up the price of    
 horse feed.                           </content>
