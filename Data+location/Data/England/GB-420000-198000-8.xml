		<content> The C15th.{Parish Church}of St.       
 Lawrence stands in the centre of the  
 town and its spire dominates the      
 skyline. It is a busy church with     
 Sunday and mid-week services plus     
 youth groups, house meetings and      
 outings. In the summer we have God's  
 Workshop activity week for the        
 children and cottage teas are sold    
 each Sunday afternoon.                
   The{Methodist Church}is almost a    
 hundred years old. About twenty people
 attend Sunday services and jumble     
 sales help raise money for the Church.
 A{Sunday School}has re-opened and     
 hopes to attract more young people.   
   The{Chapel}of the Annunciation at   
 the Convent is a modern building and  
 has daily services. The Chaplain,     
 Father Bacon, is a Jesuit Priest.     
   The Memorial Hall is also used as an
 American{Baptist Church.              </content>
