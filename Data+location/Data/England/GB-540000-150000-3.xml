		<title>03CHANGES IN LIFE, LIMPSFIELD</title>
		<content>  A lady aged 79 is the third          
 generation of her family to have lived
 in{Limpsfield.}                       
  Over the years the shops have changed
 and can no longer supply everything.  
 Therefore people shop in{Oxted.}They  
 also have to go there for medical aid.
  Only one of the three original pubs  
 remain but there are sports and       
 ex_service clubs. The organisation{   
{"LINK"}helps the elderly and disabled.
  The inhabitants were farmers and     
 farmhands until the railway provided  
 transport for commuters. It is still a
 close-knit community - it accepts the 
 retired and newcomers warmly.         
  Crime has increased sharply. The     
 houses have been adapted to meet      
 modern requirements, but the external 
 characteristics have been kept. The   
 motorway has reduced heavy traffic    
 through {Limpsfield village.}         </content>
