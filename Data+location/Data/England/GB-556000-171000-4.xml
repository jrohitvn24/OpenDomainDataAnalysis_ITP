		<title>04A Typical Day at School</title>
		<content>   When I get to school I go straight  
 into the playground.  At 8.55 a.m. the
 whistle blows.  We all go into our    
 classrooms.  First of all we have     
 register.  Then we go to the hall for 
 assembly where we sing hymns, hear    
 stories and pray to God.  We go back  
 into the classroom again to do maths, 
 English, project and reading.  We have
 three playtimes during the day.       
 Morning play lasts 15 minutes, lunch  
 play is an hour and afternoon play is 
 10 minutes.  On Mondays and Wednesdays
 we have Physical Education and in the 
 summer term we have swimming in the   
 school swimming pool on Thursdays.    
 When we finish school, we tidy up and 
 put our chairs on our desks.  School  
 finishes at 3.20 p.m.  There are lots 
 of after school clubs that we can go  
 to.
