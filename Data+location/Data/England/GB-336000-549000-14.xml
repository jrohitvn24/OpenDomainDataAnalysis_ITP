		<title>14Dalston Hall</title>
		<content> On friday 20th June Craig Smith and   
 Keith Dickinson took the opportunity  
 of sleeping at Dalston Hall.This      
 is what happened.When we went in Mr   
 Bishop took us straight to the        
 library.Our mums and dads took our    
 things up to our room which was number
 10.We had a chat and a drink of       
 coke.Later that evening Mr Bishop took
 us into the restaurant to have        
 chips,beans and sausages.After that we
 went up to our room.We watched TV     
 until midnight when Mr Bishop came for
 us to go ghost hunting.There are two  
 ghosts there.We had no luck.In the    
 morning we did some work until 10:30am
 when we went home.Part of the ground  
 is a camping park but it is owned by  
 different people.The hall is now used 
 as a commercial hotel.
