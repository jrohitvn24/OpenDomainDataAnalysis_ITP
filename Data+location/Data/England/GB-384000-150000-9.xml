		<title>09W.WILTS SAILING ASSOCIATION</title>
		<content>   A popular leisure facility in       
 Westbury in 1985 is a young persons'  
 Sailing Association which sails on a  
 lake near the railway station and     
 trains children between ages of 6 and 
 16 to sail safely.  There are 16      
 boats in use, mostly Topper dinghies  
 and a rescue boat with an outboard    
 motor which has a speed of over 30    
 knots. In June 1985 the membership    
 was 14 students and 5 instructors,    
 the subscription was Â£3.50 per year   
 plus 35p per session for use of boat, 
 life jacket and personal insurance.   
 Sailing is on Thursdays &amp; Fridays from
 6pm to dusk. On Sundays the club races
 are held; all sailing members have to 
 rig and de-rig their own boats and    
 there is compulsory practice in 'Man  
 overboard' and 'capsize' emergency    
 drills. The lake is an old ironstone  
 minehole between 1 and 2 metres deep. </content>
