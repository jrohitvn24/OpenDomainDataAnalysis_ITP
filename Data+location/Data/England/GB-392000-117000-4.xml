		<content> In the year{1985},lambing on the      
{Rushmore}Estate took place in{late    
{April}and{early May}.We interviewed   
{Mr.Conio}and his assistant who were   
 reaching the end of the lambing       
 period.A caravan was parked by the    
 lambing pens so that they could sleep 
 when possible.                        
  On the estate there are{1500 ewes}and
 about{300 rams}are brought down from  
{Scotland}.The breed of sheep is{Mules}
 and they expect{2500 lambs.}The reason
 why lambing is so late is that the    
 grass is in short supply.             
  About {2%}of the lambs do not survive
 ,this is considered a{high}percentage 
 when the lambs reach a good weight    
 they are sent off to the {slaughter   
{house}.                               
  Being a shepherd is a tough job      
 because the hours are long.
