		<title>08Legends of Bomere Pool.</title>
		<content>   There are two legends about Bomere  
 Pool. One says that it contains a     
 monster fish which carries Wild       
 Edric's sword at its side.No one will 
 be able to catch this fish until      
 Edric's descendants return to         
 Condover Hall.Wild Edric was a local  
 'Hereward the Wake'who resisted the   
 Normans at the time of the conquest   
 and is believed to have been born in a
 house on the site of Condover Hall.   
   Another tale states that a village  
 once on the site of Bomere Pool was   
 drowned when a dam burst.This was     
 punishment for the wickedness of the  
 villagers who mocked and threw mud at 
 their priest.If you row on the pool   
 at midnight on Christmas Eve you are  
 supposed to be able to hear the       
 sanctuary bell ringing faintly under  
 the water.                            
                                       </content>
