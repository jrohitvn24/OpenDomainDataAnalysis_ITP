		<content> As there is no regular bus serving    
 Ravenglass there is a community car   
 scheme financed by Cumbria County     
 Council and administered by the WRVS  
 using volunteer drivers who receive   
 17p/ml,(10p/ml paid by the user and   
 7p/ml paid by the WRVS).It costs Â£1.50
 to visit the surgery and considerably 
 more to visit council offices,clinics,
 relatives in hospital,etc.            
 However for people referred by doctors
 there is,in addition to the normal    
 ambulances,a well-developed hospital  
 car service using volunteer           
 car-owners.                           
 From Easter to October the 'Mountain  
 Goat'minibus service calls into       
 Ravenglass as part of day trips from  
 Windermere and Keswick.               
 There is a regular bus service along  
 the main A595 road provided by BNFL   
 for its shift workers.                </content>
