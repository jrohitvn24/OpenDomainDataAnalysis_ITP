		<title>05MOSS VALLEY, ITS USE BY MAN</title>
		<content>      The Moss Valley runs from Coal   
 Aston to Eckington where it joins the 
 Rother. It is an outstanding example  
 of a valley largely unaffectedd by    
 20th Century development. It does     
 however have a long history of use by 
 man. Once the valley was mainly wooded
 but by the 17th Century, clearances   
 had created the mosaic we see today.  
      At first the land was farmed but 
 the discovery of iron in the 13th     
 Century created an iron industry.     
 Later on coal was found and this      
 replaced wood for smalting, to produce
 high quality agricultural tools like  
 sickles. These industries have now    
 gone from the valley but they have    
 left their mark with the remains of   
 drift mines into the hillside and     
 trackways used for transporting       
 materials. Farming now dominates once 
 more.                                 </content>
