		<content> The framer has no son to hand over to.
 In the past 6 or 7 men would have been
 employed. The farm labourer came from 
 Scotland and was himself a farmers    
 son. He works 7 days a week starting  
 at 8 am and finishing at 10 pm in the 
 summer. He has one hour dinner break  
 and \ hour tea-break. He lives in a   
 caravan. There are no tied cottages.  
 For his basic 40 hours a week he      
 receives Â£88, the rest is overtime at 
 1\ times the basic rate.  The farmer  
 has 2 silage trailors, 4 tractors/    
 ploughs, cultivators/harrows,         
 milking machines and 2 bulk storage   
 tanks. Today some of the work is      
 contracted out on the farm, mainly    
 lime spreading and occasionally stone 
 picking. Mr Austin the farmer buys in 
 hay.
