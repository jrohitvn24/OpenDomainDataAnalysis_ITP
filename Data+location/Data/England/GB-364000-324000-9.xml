 Ercall but we do have some old war    
 hangers which are used for storage .  
  They store{wood shavings}which are   
 used for animal bedding and sawdust   
 which is also used for animal bedding 
 .They store milk powder and milk      
 products,{packing cases, machinery,   
 rubber and empty tins and jars.       
 Another hanger is used by a local     
 farmer for potatoes untill they are   
 needed at the shops.On another site   
 there are 3 hangers one of which is   
 used by a potatoes merchant for the   
 storage, sorting and bagging of       
 potatoes for the wholesale market.
