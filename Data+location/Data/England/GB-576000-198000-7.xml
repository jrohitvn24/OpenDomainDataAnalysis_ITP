		<content> Snooker is popular with all ages at   
 home and in the Village Hall. Also a  
 very popular TV sport. Football is    
 mainly enjoyed by the young and is    
 less popular recently as a spectator  
 sport because of the increase in      
 hooliganism. Jogging and marathons are
 enjoyed by spectators and all ages in 
 'fun runs'. Denser house building has 
 resulted in smaller gardens but off   
 estates gardens are larger.           
 Greenhouses provide tomatoes and      
 cucumbers. Children enjoy small plots 
 of their own. Houseplants can be found
 in every home. Common vegetables      
 grown; runner beans, lettuces,        
 carrots, radishes, brussel sprouts,   
 cauliflowers, potatoes, onions and    
 cabbages. Traditional games such as   
 chess, draughts, ludon and Monopoly   
 still seem more popular than the newer
 computer games.                       </content>
