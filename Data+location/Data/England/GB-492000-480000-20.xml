		<content>  Snainton is not a very large village 
 but it is nice for me to live in.The  
 thing I like about it is the playing  
 field. There are swings for the older 
 people and 2 baby swings as well as   
 climbing frame and a slide.There is a 
 see-saw and at one time it snapped in 
 two.Down at the bottom of the field is
 a bowling green.There is a fish &amp; chip
 shop owned by by a friendly chap      
 called Norman Hartley.My mum works    
 there.There is a milk round service.Mr
 Nicholson owns it and he has an       
 electric float.There is a fire station
 and a Policeman.He is Mr.Kay and his  
 daughter goes to our school.The thing 
 I would really like to have in        
 Snainton is a Sports Centre with every
 sport there is.If I had to move I     
 would not like to leave Snainton but  
 move to another house in the village.
