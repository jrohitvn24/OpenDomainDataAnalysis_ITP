 in Upper Framilode,Lower Framilode and
 Rodley.In Rodley there is a mixture of
{Farms} and{Cottages}all of which are  
 owner occupied.All of the houses are  
 on either side of the road in Linear  
 development.There are no{shops}or     
{public houses}but there is a small    
{Village Hall}and{Church.              
  On the opposite side of the river are
 the small communities of Framilode and
 Upper Framilode.There are again no{   
{shops} but there are two{Public Houses
  called the{Dorell Arms}and the{Ship  
{Inn.}There is a{Church}called{St.     
{Peter's}.There were more {terraced    
{cottages}built alongside the disused  
 canal but the houses on the whole were
 more modern.Some had been built quite 
 recently.
