		<content>   Only a few people thought the area  
 was so bad it spoilt their stay. At   
 least 95% of the people travelled down
 by car, and the rest came by train.   
   A few people were staying in a      
 hotel, but the majority were staying  
 in caravans or chalets which were     
 generally clean and big enough. Only  
 the Holimarine chalets were heavily   
 critisied. In the nights just about   
 all the people stayed in the camp or  
 gone to the beach, a few people had   
 gone to Gt.Yarmouth and generally     
 thought it was good.                  
   It seems as if Hopton is a family   
 resort and the holiday camps cater for
 this.Although 50% of the people hadn't
 met locals, those who had, generally  
 thought they were friendly.
