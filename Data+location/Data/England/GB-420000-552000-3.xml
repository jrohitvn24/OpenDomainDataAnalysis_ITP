		<title>03Employment</title>
		<content> In our survey we found the most common
 type of employment was factory        
 work(out of the area),cleaning,driving
 and working on the ship yards.The     
 varied list of employment also        
 contained salesmen,civil servants,shop
 assistants,brewery workers,mechanics  
 and builders.                         
  Of the people surveyed we found the  
 incidence of 'working mothers' to be  
 quiet low.Those who did work were     
 employed as night-time bar staff or   
 worked in the local schools as        
 'nannies' or kitchen staff.           
  Unemployment is quite a problem      
 within the area,particularly for the  
 young.The unemployment rate is        
 currently standing at between 17% and 
 19%.Youth training schemes are hard   
 tofind.
