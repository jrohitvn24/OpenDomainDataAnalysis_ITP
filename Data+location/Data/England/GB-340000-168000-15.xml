		<content>  Along the main{Clevedon Road}to{     
{Yatton}can be found the quiet and     
 interesting village of{Kenn.}Most of  
 its population of{280}however live in 
 largely detatched, stone houses along{
{Kenn Street.}Here too is the church of
{St.John}- open daily from{9 a.m.}to   
{6 p.m.}The village is proud of its    
 lack of vandalism. The tiny church,   
 with Norman origins, is carpeted      
 throughout and beautifully lit by     
 stained glass windows. The oldest     
 grave found was dated {1711}and the   
 most recent,{1984.                    
  Alongside is the old school. Built in
{1851}and once attended by village     
 children, it was later sold by the    
 church and used for various businesses
 and is now being renovated as a 3     
 bedroomed bungalow offered at{Â£54,000.
 An old chapel has also been converted 
 and is opposite the old school house. </content>
