		<title>10A Comprehensive School,Corby</title>
		<content>A comprehensive school is a state run  
school teaching children of all        
abilities from 11 to 18 years and there
are five in Corby. The schools no      
longer have corporal punishment, but   
you can be placed in detention after   
school and made to copy up your work.  
The majority of the teachers are easy- 
going but in some lessons are very     
strict and you are not allowed to speak
at all. At the moment the teachers are 
on strike over their pay and we have   
missed several days of school. The main
teaching union is the National Union of
Teachers.                              
Many of the school desks are defaced   
and squeak and the chairs are often    
bent or broken. There is little money  
for repairs or replacement. We have no 
compulsory uniform and can wear any    
clothes. At lunch the cafeteria serves 
food on a first come first served basis</content>
