		<content> The postal service is efficient. Van  
 deliveries from the local sorting     
 offices at Carnforth and Milnthorpe   
 cover the area.                       
 A free local newspaper is delivered.  
 Local Council meetings are reported on
 notice boards. Church organisations   
 produce their own Parish megazines.   
 Coming Events are announced by posters
 on trees, gates, fences and poles.    
       In this area of small, friendly 
 villages, much information is         
 transmitted by word of mouth,         
 frequently by casually meeting people 
 whilst shopping.                      
 In such a rural area telephones are   
 invaluable both in emergencies and for
 social contacts.                      
 The authorities endeavour to provide  
 services as unobtrusively as possible 
 in this area of high quality          
 landscape.                            </content>
