   The recently improved Village Hall  
 is the venue for Ballroom Dancing,    
 Whist Drives and the Gardening Club   
 during weekday evenings. The Forget-me
 -Not Club meets one afternoon a week. 
 A playgroup meets there most mornings 
 and the W.I. meets there every month  
 as does the Parish Council. The School
 is used as well for Keep Fit.         
   There is also a Football Club and   
 Cricket Club on the Meadow View       
 Playing Field.                        
   The Public Houses have darts teams  
 and the Cock Inn has got a 'Pool' Team
 as well.                              
   This year will see the start of the 
 Sports Hall to be built on Meadow View
 Playing Field by the Sports and Social
 Club. There are already Changing Rooms
 and showers built.
