		<content> Excessive numbers of stock are allowed
 to graze on the moor,consequently     
 too many animals are in poor condition
 or actually starving.                 
 Foxes,moles and rabbits are considered
 a nuisance and there are too many     
 magpies.On the whole there is         
 tolerence of all wildlife.There is    
 hostility to Government policy of     
 gassing badgers;only a few people     
 think they should be destroyed.       
 Holiday cottages are generally not    
 liked, though tolerated if they are   
 well used. They are considered to     
 force prices up artificially making it
 difficult for young people  to afford 
 a house or find anywhere to live, and 
 difficult for farmers to house        
 agricultural workers.
