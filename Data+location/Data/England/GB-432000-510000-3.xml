		<content>  The Parish Church of Dinsdale-St.    
 John's in the diocese of Durham is in 
 plurality with All Saints, Hurworth,  
 and Sockburn Churches since 1962. One 
 service each Sunday is celebrated and 
 other services for special occasions  
 such as Harvest, Carol, Wedding and   
 Funeral Services.                     
  The number on the electoral roll in  
 1985 is 33, and the approximate number
 attending regular worship is 14.      
  In the church porch the horizontal   
 grave stone of Goseylynus Surtees,    
 early owner of the Manor House, can be
 seen. The graveyard surrounding the   
 church is still in use and has fine   
 examples of Hog Back Gravestones which
 are Danish in Origin                  
  The Old Rectory is now a private     
 house and the old village hall now    
 forms part of the outbuildings of this
 house. The Rector lives in Hurworth.  </content>
