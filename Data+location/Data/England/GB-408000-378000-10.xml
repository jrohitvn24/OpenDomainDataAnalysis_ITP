		<content>  Much of the community life in the    
 area is centred around two{village    
{halls,}one in Sparrowpit and one in   
 Peak Forest, around the{churches}in   
 both villages and around the{primary  
{school.                               
  Both village halls have{committees   
 who arrange dances, jumble sales,     
 whist drives, functions for the       
 elderly etc. and both are meeting     
 places for other social groups.       
  The churches arrange functions       
 primarily to raise money for their    
 upkeep and there is an annual church  
{bazaar}in Peak Forest and similar     
 events in Sparrowpit.                 
  The Primary School has an active     
{Parent Teacher's Association}which    
 organises events of a social and fund
