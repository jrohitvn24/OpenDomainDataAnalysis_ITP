		<title>19LOCAL HISTORY, EGERTON</title>
		<content>  The village originally centred on the
 Dimple area to the north of the       
 present village, with a church,       
 chapel, and church school opened in   
 1790 through public subscription. The 
 landlord resided at Dimple Hall, built
 in 1688 in course rubble masonry for a
 barrister Sergeant Welch.The old      
 Turnpike Road connecting Bolton and   
 Blackburn ran westerly at Dimple, and 
 the Globe Cottages, dated 1423 mark   
 its route. A new toll road was built  
 in the 1830's, coinciding with the    
 development of mills to the south, and
 workers residences. A dispute between 
 the mill owners, residing at Egerton  
 Hall, Dunscar House,Egerton House and 
 the Holmses, the latter two of which  
 remain, causedthe rebuilding of the   
 Church and school in 1839 in the south
 of the village.Local inns served as   
 coaching stations.                    </content>
