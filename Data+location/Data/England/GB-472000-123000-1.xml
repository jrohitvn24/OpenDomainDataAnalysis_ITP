		<title>01SUMMARY OF THE BLOCK</title>
		<content> This block consists of the town of {  
{Petersfield}with the villages of {    
{Sheet, Steep}and part of{Stroud. }The 
 surrounding area is mainly farmland   
 with a belt of woodland in the North- 
 West corner.                          
 Petersfield is a market town of almost
 11 000 people on the main A3 road     
 between London and Portsmouth. It is  
 54 miles to London.  The cities of    
 Portsmouth, Winchester, Chichester and
 Guildford are all about 20 miles away.
 The railway station is quite busy, as 
 many people work in London or         
 Portsmouth. The journey to Waterloo   
 station takes a little over an hour.  
 Market days are on Wednesday and      
 Saturday.
