		<title>10HEPWORTH FEAST</title>
		<content>   Hepworth Feast started after the    
 Great Plague ended. Held on a Monday  
 on or after the 24th of June, the     
 village school closes and there is a  
 parade with a band which plays in the 
 afternoon and evening. At the 1985    
 parade there were 15 bandsmen playing 
 in the Hepworth Silver Band. Formerly 
 there was a fair and a village cricket
 match with races in the evening, now  
 there are only races. There are races 
 for girls and boys, sprint races and  
 sack races and a relay race for local 
 schools. In 1985 Scholes Junior school
 won the relay. About 120 people walked
 on the parade, which left the school, 
 went up through the village down to   
 Dean Bridge up to Scholes, through    
 Jackson Bridge and back up to         
 Hepworth. The band played near the    
 Butchers Arms and the school in       
 Scholes.                              </content>
