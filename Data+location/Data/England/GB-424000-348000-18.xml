		<content>{Employment.}Traditionally an area     
 where many people prefer to be        
 self-employed if possible and any new 
 small businesses should be encouraged.
 There are very few labouring type of  
 men left in the village. Something is 
 needed to provide work for females.   
 Recently many farms have gone out of  
 milk production.                      
{Carsington Reservoir.}This should be  
 completed, made safe and seen to be   
 safe to reassure local residents. Also
 this provides much needed employment. 
 The Derbys. County Council and West   
 Derbys. District Council see this     
 project attracting tourism to offset  
 the decline in quarry and agriculture 
 industries in this district.          
{Sewage Works. }Modern, in good order  
 and capable of taking more effluent.  
{Footpaths.}There are 30 in the        
 Parish, 27 of which are clear.        </content>
