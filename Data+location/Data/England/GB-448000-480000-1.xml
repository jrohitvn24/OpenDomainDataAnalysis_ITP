		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> The area is situated in North         
 Yorkshire to the west of the Hambleton
 Hills.Most of the land is used for    
 farming and forestry. Nearly half     
 of the area is enclosed by the North  
 Yorkshire Moors National Park.        
 The village of Sutton under           
 Whitestonecliffe occupies the north   
 west corner. Most of the inhabitants  
 of the village commute to their       
 employment. In the remainder of the   
 area most own or are employed on the  
 local farms.                          
 The small market town of Thirsk lies  
 three miles west of the village and   
 provides amenities such as            
 supermarkets, banks,public baths and  
 comprehensive school.The only public  
 transport from the village is a bus to
 the market in Thirsk once a week.
