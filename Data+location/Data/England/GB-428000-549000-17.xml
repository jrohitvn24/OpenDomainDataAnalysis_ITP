      This was opened in 1971. A Sports
 Hall  was added  later,  paid  for  by
 fund-raising  activities and  a  grant
 from the Sports Council. The  big hall
 has a stage for  dance bands, concerts
 etc.There is a canteen,an office and a
 number of smaller rooms. The Centre is
 run  by  a   Management  Committee  of
 volunteers.    Two  part-time  Wardens
 co-ordinate the many activities, which
 include Radio Clubs,  Youth Clubs, the
 Friday Club  for the  elderly  and the
 disabled,  table  tennis,  five-a-side
 football,  bowls,  badminton,  weight-
 lifting and aerobics. A Play Group and
 a Mother and Toddler Group  are run by
 volunteers.  Old  Age  Pensioners, the
 Women's Institute  and  British Legion
 meet, and  the  County Library holds a
 weekly session here.    {  G.Gettings.</content>
