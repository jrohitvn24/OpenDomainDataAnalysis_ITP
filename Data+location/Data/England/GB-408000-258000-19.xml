		<title>19Three Schools, Alcester</title>
		<content>      Two schools take children up to  
 the age of eleven. One is an R.C.     
 primary school called Our Lady's,     
 which has 94 children in 3 classes.   
 The other, Kinwarton House, is a small
 private school with 28 children in 4  
 classes. The youngest are 3 years old.
 We think people pay for their children
 to go there because it is a lovely,   
 200-year old building with attractive 
 grounds. The children have pleasant   
 surroundings in which to play, and,   
 because classes are small, they get a 
 lot of attention from adults and a    
 good chance to use things like the    
 computer.                             
      The third school, the Greville   
 High School, is a secondary modern    
 school for 344 children between 11 and
 16. In September 1985 it will join    
 with Bidford High School and will be  
 known as Alcester High School.        </content>
