		<title>07Book Binding in Wootton</title>
		<content>Two people called Sarah and Chris work 
in Wootton,they do Book Binding.They   
got into doing Book Binding by watching
some-one else doing it.Both of them    
enjoy doing it a lot.They were trained 
at Guilford in Surrey.They work from   
Monday to Friday and usually on        
Saturday morning.They have been doing  
it for 3 years,but they trained for 2  
years.Mostly old people come to get    
their family Bibles bound.The hardest  
book they had ever done was one which  
was not yet completed,it was a Bible.  
Sarah and Chris said it was satisfying 
and relaxing work.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
