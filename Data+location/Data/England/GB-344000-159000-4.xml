		<content> Housing is well maintained and gardens
 are neat and tidy. There are very few 
 local authority built houses _ the    
 largest estate being Stock Mead-.     
   Farms in the district are not large 
 and do not provide employment for many
 people.Farm machinery is cheaper than 
 labour.Sources of employment in the   
 district include the Mushroom  Farm,  
 which  employs many partime people,   
 the Veterinary College, a branch of   
 Bristol University and Meat Research  
 Institute, and a small industrial     
 estate at Langford.                   
  In Churchill there seem to be more   
 elderly people than young families and
 teenagers. Most people tend to be very
 friendly and helpful, always ready to 
 contribute to the events in and around
 Churchill.
