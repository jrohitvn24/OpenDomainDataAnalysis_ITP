		<title>12BROWNIES OF WESTWOODSIDE</title>
		<content>   {Brownies}meet at Haxey school at   
 6.15_7.30pm on Mondays and Thursdays. 
 There are 36{Brownies}in our group all
 aged between 7 and 10. At meetings    
 they play games, sing, do handicrafts,
 have sports evenings and parties.     
   Sometimes Brown Owl organises trips.
 Not long ago they went to York to the 
 Viking Centre. They have also been to 
 Brownie Revels, Pack Holidays and     
 Fun days.                             
   They have been collecting 1p for the
 people in Lebanon and milk bottle     
 tops and silver foil for OXFAM.       
    This year is the 75th birthday of  
{Brownies}and each girl has been given 
 a badge. There are also birthday      
 badges, venture badges and interest   
 badges.                               
   The most important reason to become 
 a{Brownie}is to learn how to be a     
 better citizen.                       </content>
