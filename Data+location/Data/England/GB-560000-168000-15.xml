		<title>15A Saturday Morning</title>
		<content>     I am thirteen years old and live  
 in Northdown Road.I usualy get up at  
 around ten 'o'clock and go downstairs 
 in my pyjamas and dressing gown.      
 Breakfast is a cup of coffee and      
 Weetabix with sugar and milk.I eat    
 this while watching television-either 
 Saturday Super Store or cartoons. I   
 get washed and dressed when something 
 boring comes on . When I am dressed I 
 either continue watching TV or go down
 Longfield Ave. where people keep their
                                       
 horses and help or watch . You can    
 keep your horse there and pay full    
 livery which is Â£18.00 per week or you
 can go D.I.Y. at Â£12.50 per week and  
 do your own mucking out. At about     
 12.30 I go back home for lunch with   
 my mum,dad and sister,and this might  
 be toasted sandwiches or fish and     
 chips.                                </content>
