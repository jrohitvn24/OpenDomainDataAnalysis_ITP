		<content>  None of the dwellings in the area are
 connected to the main drainage system.
 They are either connected to a septic 
 tank or a cess pit.                   
  Likewise none of the dwellings are   
 connected to the main gas supply.     
 Where gas is required, for cooking or 
 heating, it is either in the form of  
 bottled gas or is delivered in liquid 
 form to tanks.                        
  Electricity is available to all      
 dwellings, but because the supply is  
 by way of overhead cables it is       
 subject to disruption from high winds 
 and snow.                             
  Most dwellings are connected to the  
 main water system, although one or two
 retain their own water supply.
