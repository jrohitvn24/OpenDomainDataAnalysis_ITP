		<content> Godshill Landscape and Ecology.       
 This is a rural area, devoted to      
 farming - crop, animal and market     
 gardening.  The soil is deep and      
 fertile and the climate mild.  The    
 area is cut by four valleys running   
 roughly North/South, cut by           
 tributaries of the eastern River      
 Yar,which flows into the Solent at    
 Bembridge.  These valleys are marshy  
 and not suitable for ploughing and    
 show up clearly in the pattern of     
 fields.  The picturesque village of   
 Godshill in the south-west corner of  
 the area was originally a small       
 cluster of cottages around the foot of
 a hill on which stands the 14C        
 Church.It is now a dormitory area, its
 own industry being tourism as is      
 evident from the large car parks, tea 
 gardens, gift shops and resort        
 attractions.                          </content>
