 Porthallow is the other village in    
 this block.  It was once heavily      
 involved in the Pilchard industry.    
 The pub is called the Five Pilchards  
 and has a lovely display of           
 photographs and items retrieved from  
 wrecks.  The pub is right by the beach
 which is completely covered in smooth 
 stones. When the tide is out a large  
 edifice called Channel Rock can be    
 reached.  This village is very        
 popular in the summer and             
 accommodation is provided for tourists
 in bed and breakfast  and holiday     
 apartments. There is a post office    
 which sells gifts and food.  The old  
 school is now an adventure centre run 
 by the County's Youth Service. There  
 are two tea rooms, one with a garden  
 and the other is a converted fishing  
 loft.                                 </content>
