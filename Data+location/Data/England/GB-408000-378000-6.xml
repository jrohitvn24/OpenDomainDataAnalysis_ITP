		<content> Cattle graze in the fields in summer  
 but sheep are often out all the year  
 round.Winter feed is either{hay or    
{silage}but in recent years more people
 have started to turn to silage in     
 round bales and stored the bales in   
 plastic bags.Silage is not so         
 dependent on dry weather,It makes     
 storage easier and the silage is      
 better for milk cows.Perhaps in a few 
 years time{hay making will}be a thing 
 of the past.                          
 Fields are often re-sown and          
 fertilised both by muckspreading  and 
 chemical fertilisers.This means that  
{wild flowers are not so common}in the 
 meadows.                              
 Hay and bagged feed are often bought  
 in from local suppliers and{straw}is  
 always bought in as no grain is grown 
 locally.                              
                                       </content>
