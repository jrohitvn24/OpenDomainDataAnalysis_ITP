		<title>11Longage Farm; lambing</title>
		<content> Lambing starts at the beginning of    
 March and the lambing average this    
 year was 170%. The lambs are taken to 
 Canterbury Market where they are sold.
 They usually weigh 16 kilograms. Sheep
 are dipped twice a year in autumn and 
 in summer to prevent scab, tics and   
 lice. The sheep are dipped on the     
 premises and must stay under water in 
 the dip for one minute. At the        
 beginning of June the sheep shearing  
 starts. Contract shearers shear the   
 sheep and Kent lambs. There is still a
 demand for lambs' wool. The shearing  
 takes one day. Each fleece weighs     
 about nine pounds. The sheep have     
 their feet trimmed twice a year       
 because of foot rot. Mr Ridley-Day    
 does all the work on his farm with the
 help of a shepherd and a sheepdog.
