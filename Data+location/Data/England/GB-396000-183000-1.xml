		<title>01INTRODUCTION, SOMERFORD AREA</title>
		<content>   We are class 3 of the Walter Powell 
 Primary School,Great Somerford,Wilts. 
 Our area of study covers Little       
 Somerford village, Cleverton hamlet   
 and part of Great Somerford.The       
 nearest towns are Malmesbury,Wootton  
 Bassett and Chippenham.The area       
 population is approx.600, mostly      
 living in Little Somerford.           
   This is flat open grassland used for
 dairyfarming,its highest point being  
 91m.A.S.L. The soil is limestone and  
 the water is "very hard". The area is 
 crossed by the River Avon,the B4042   
 road and several minor roads, one     
 leading to the M4. The main London to 
 Bristol railway line bisects the area 
 south of Little Somerford.            
   We shall be looking at population   
 and social features,a local farm,some 
 significant buildings,and some local  
 flora and fauna.                      </content>
