 WE SHARE OUR RECTOR WITH FOUR OTHER   
 PARISHES.   THERE ARE TWO CHURCHES,   
 SAINT MARYS AT LITTLE FRANSHAM, WHICH 
 IS NOW THE PARISH CHURCH, AND ALL     
 SAINTS AT GREAT FRANSHAM WHICH IS NOW 
 THE CHAPEL OF EASE.                   
                                       
 THERE IS A PAROCHIAL CHURCH COUNCIL OF
 14 WHO ARE LONG STANDING MEMBERS OF   
 THE CHURCH AND WORK TO RAISE MONEY TO 
 CARRY OUT REPAIRS TO BOTH CHURCHES.   
 THEY HOLD AN ANNUAL LUNCH AND IN THE  
 AUTUMN ARE HOLDING A FLOWER           
 DEMONSTRATION IN SWAFFHAM.            
                                       
 THE CONGREGATION IS VERY SMALL EXCEPT 
 AT HARVEST FESTIVAL AND CHRISTMAS WHEN
 THE CHURCH IS FULL.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
