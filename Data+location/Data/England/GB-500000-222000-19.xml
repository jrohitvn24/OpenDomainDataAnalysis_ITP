  Education also takes place outside   
 and beyond the school buildings and   
 grounds. As part of their studies     
 pupils regulary visit and work at     
 places with geographical, historical, 
 scientific, comercial, sociological   
 and natural interest. Some of these   
 are nearby and can be visited in a    
 morning or afternoon.                 
                                       
   For other field work or residential 
 courses pupils stay at palces further 
 afield e.g. the Peak district, North  
 Wales,  and Nether Swell which is     
 in Gloucestershire etc. These are a   
 regular feature of school life.
