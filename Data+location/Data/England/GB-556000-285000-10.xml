		<title>10LITTLEPORT BOAT HAVEN</title>
		<content> The{marina}at Littleport was          
 originally a short canal built from   
 the River Ouse to the railway station,
 where barges containing carrots,      
 potatoes etc. could be off-loaded.    
                                       
 Commercial trade on the river has     
 ceased and boat owners use the River  
 Ouse and its tributaries, the Cam,    
 Lark, Wissey and Little Ouse, for     
 recreation.Now 47 boats are           
 permanently moored there, both        
 privately owned and for hire. Most are
{narrow boats}(Polly-Ann is 17 metres  
 long) or cruisers, but 2 are{sailing  
{boats}(one called "Graculus" the      
 bird from the story of Noggin the Nog)
                                       
 There are chandlery and petrol/water  
 pumps to service the up to 20 tourist 
 and hire cruisers that call in daily.
