		<title>08Going Shopping.</title>
		<content> Our area has two{grocery shops}which  
 are also off-licences and newsagents. 
 These shops also have cooked meat and 
 delicatessen counters, and one has a  
 pet and garden centre as part of it.  
 The{post office}also sells food. There
 are{two butchers}and a{bakery}which   
 open most days of the week. Some      
 people like to shop in the larger     
{supermarkets and cash and carries}in  
 Liskeard, Launceston and Plymouth,    
 where prices are often lower. Clothes,
 furniture and other large goods are   
 often bought at Trago Mills (a        
 shopping centre near Liskeard) or     
 Plymouth. Many people also shop by    
{mail order,}looking at things in      
 catalogues and buying by post. Very   
 often the goods are paid for by       
 instalments over a period of several  
 months.       {Simon James Fitton.
