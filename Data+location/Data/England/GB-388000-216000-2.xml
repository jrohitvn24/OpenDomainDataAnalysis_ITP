		<title>02FARMING IN THE AREA</title>
		<content>{The farming is mainly mixed}and caters
 for the surrounding urban areas.      
   At the turn of the century most of  
 the land was in small holdings of     
 approx.20 acres.These small units have
 now been absorbed into 200-400 acre   
 farms although a few are about 100    
 acres still.                          
  {Grain is the main crop}now e.g.wheat
 and barley for livestock and some     
 milling wheat for biscuit making.     
   {Sheep farming}is now more in       
 evidence as there is less demand      
 nationally for milk.Dairy herds are   
 only one tenth the size they were 10  
 years ago.                            
   {The main types of machinery}used   
 are:2 &amp;4 wheel drive tractors,chain   
 harrows,heavy rollers,power-driven    
 fertiliser spreaders,hay turners,     
 combined harvesters,ploughs,grain     
 planting machines,crop spreaders,etc. </content>
