		<content> I counted up how many houses there    
 were in the area and there were twenty
 nine.Nine of them are holiday cottages
 and the others are occupied all the   
 time.There is a Post Office in Ulpha  
 near the church.Near the Post Office  
 there are some Alms Houses.There are  
 some foresters in the area and they   
 have four special houses for them.Nine
 of them are farms.There are no doctors
 but there is a vet.Miss Craig lives in
 the School House and she is the the   
 headmistress at Ulpha School.
