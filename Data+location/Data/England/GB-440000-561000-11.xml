		<content>    Whitburn, being a large village,   
 has several amenities. These fall into
 two broad categories - standard       
 amenities and social amenities.       
    The social amenities cater for all 
 age-groups and attract visitors as    
 well as residents to participate.     
    The Community Association, based on
 the campus of Whitburn Comprehensive  
 School, offers an increasing number of
 sporting activities, such as yoga,    
 dancing, keep fit, swimming,          
 gymnastics, squash etc. There are also
 vocational classes - craft, computer  
 studies, etc., as well as a coffee    
 bar, where people can socialise.      
    The Barnes Institute, dating back  
 to 1904, is similar to a village hall,
 in that it is a centre for choirs,    
  dances, and sales, and a local senior
 citizens' club.
