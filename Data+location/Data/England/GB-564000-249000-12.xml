		<content> Pollution presents no problem here,   
 even the black smuts caused by stubble
 burning are kept to the minimum by the
 landowner's policy of ploughing in,   
 despite the extra time and expense    
 involved. Ditches and hedgerows are   
 protected, wild flowers being allowed 
 to bloom and seed before the verges   
 are cut or sprayed, indeed the owner  
 personally keeps and eye on           
 particularly rare plants. A walk along
 the narrow winding lanes reveals the  
 rewards of this husbandry; daredevil  
 pheasants dart across the road, a shy 
 rabbit hops into a wheat field,       
 butterflies hover among the tansy and 
 hedgeroses, and spring reveals        
 cowslips, oxslips and the occasional  
 bold hare surveying the empty         
 landscape. Roadside avenues of trees  
 have been planted, &amp; the Anglian Water
 Authority breeds coarse fish here.    </content>
