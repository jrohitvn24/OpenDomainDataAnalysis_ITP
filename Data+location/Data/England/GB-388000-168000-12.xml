		<title>12Lacock Spring Fair cont.</title>
		<content> Mr. Sparkes and his dog were at the   
{Spring Fair}because you had to guess  
 how much Mr. Sparkes' dog weighed.    
 There was a{raffle}and a game of{darts
 that Mr. Gould organised.  There was a
{fancy dress parade}for the children.  
 Some of the children in our school    
 went to it.  They dressed up in       
 costumes from different countries.    
 Linda and I did not dress up to be in 
 the parade.  The best bit of the      
{Spring Fair}that I liked was the{fancy
{dress parade}because everyone dressd  
 up very nice, especially my friends   
 like Paula, Deborah and Anthea.  This 
 year the{Spring Fair}raised Â£301.  The
 top class did some{maypole dancing}too
 and that was very nice.
