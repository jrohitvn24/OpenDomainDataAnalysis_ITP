		<title>18CHISLET  MY DAY</title>
		<content> I usually get up about 6 o'clock am.  
 My dad goes to work about 7.OO am he  
 sometimes gets my cereal in the       
 morning. I live in Marshside - we have
 a field of about 2 acres and we keep  
 my pony in the field.  We used to keep
 sheep, ducks, chickens, dogs, cats,   
 rabbits, fish and two guinea pigs, but
 now we only have a dog, 2 cats and a  
 horse but we are going to get them all
 back.  I go to Chislet School it is a 
 small village school and we only have 
 52 children.  Our head teacher is a   
 man.  I have quite a lot of friends   
 one of them lives in Marshside.  There
 are loads of people who have horses, I
 belong to a riding club and we do a   
 lot of events on our horses.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
