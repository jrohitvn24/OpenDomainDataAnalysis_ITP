		<content>    There are lots of different people 
 who live in Croxteth.   My Mum and Dad
 have no jobs so my Dad sits and reads 
 his paper and my Mum does the         
 housework.   There are some people who
 work, and there are people looking for
 jobs.   In Croxteth there are many    
 people on the dole, and there are     
 people who work.   There are the      
 doctors, postmen, policemen,          
 caretakers, teachers, and lots more.  
 There is the bus-driver who takes     
 people to Liverpool and then back to  
 Croxteth.  Some taxis just stay around
 Croxteth to take people to Broadway   
 and to town.   In Croxteth there are  
 woods, and Croxteth Country Park. They
 have built a new Sports Centre, but it
 isn't open yet. They have knocked a   
 lot of the flats down to make         
 bungalows.
