		<title>05BROADWAY ALMS HOUSES</title>
		<content> The Alms Houses were built in 1588,by 
 J.V.Baker and sons.The descendants of 
 those Bakers are still builders in    
 Broadway today.                       
    Some of the walls upstairs are of  
 the original wattle and daub.Upstairs 
 and downstairs there are still the    
 original oak beams.The windows have   
 got hamstone frames,the glass is      
 slightly coloured.Wooden pegs are used
 to hold the beams together instead of 
 nails.                                
    There were originally seven houses 
 but now there are only four.Today they
 are used for old people to live       
 in,they have central heating fitted in
 every room.The people don't have  to  
 pay rent because there is a trustee   
 scheme.
