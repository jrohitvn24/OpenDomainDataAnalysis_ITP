		<title>03 Working in Irthlingborough.</title>
		<content>    One of these local industries was  
iron ore mining.The land in east       
Northamptonshire is rich in ironstone  
hence the steel works at Corby .The    
ore mined in our area fed these steel  
works.Around Irthlingborough the ore   
was tunnel mined and the resulting     
tunnels have caused many problems.The  
danger of subsidence makes much of the 
land unsafe for building. The mines    
were worked for about one hundred      
years and finally closed in the mid    
60's.The other main source of          
employment was the shoe and leather    
industries.At one time we had 9 shoe   
and leather producing factories, but   
now there are only 2 or 3 closing      
rooms and 3 or 4 leather makers.The    
main employer  now is Whitworths       
who have a large dry goods packaging   
plant here. Now, Irthlingborough is    
mostly a dormitory town.               </content>
