		<content> Lancashire has a strong dialect which 
 dates back to man's first utterings.  
 Hyndburn also has a variation on the  
 Lancashire dialect all to itself.  In 
 Hyndburn  most of the people speak    
 English.  There are other languages   
 which are spoken, Urdu, Punjabi and   
 Bengoli.  Most of the Muslims in      
 Hyndburn speak Punjabi.  Muslims write
 right to left.  Most of the English   
 people think the Muslims are writing  
 wrong but they are not because they   
 have their own rules.  Most local     
 Muslims speak Punjabi though with a   
 western dialect.  Many Muslim children
 are speaking English with a Lancashire
 dialect and using the old Lancashire  
 sayings.  Here are some:  "E's popped 
 his clogs" means "He has died".       
 "There's nowt queerer than folk" means
 "Everybody's different".
