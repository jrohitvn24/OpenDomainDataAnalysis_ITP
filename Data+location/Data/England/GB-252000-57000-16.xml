		<content>   Our school looks quite new.It is a  
 one story building with flat roofs.We 
 have three mobile classrooms and a    
 swimming pool.The hall is the biggest 
 room in the school where we have P.E. 
 and assemblies.There are infants and  
 juniors in our school.Altogether the  
 school has eleven classes.Our class   
 has twenty one second years and       
 sixteen third years.                  
   When we come into the classroom we  
 read and then do our work.During the  
 day we do maths and english from the  
 blackboard or a text book then we do  
 spelling.Some times we do exercises   
 from a dictionary.Sometimes we have to
 write a story in our English book.    
 Sometimes we do some work on the      
 computer.In summer we have swimming   
 four times a week.We do P.E.and music 
 and movement.On Wednesday we have     
 games.                                </content>
