		<title>16Bridport Arts Centre.</title>
		<content>      Bridport Arts Society was        
 formed in 1968 to bring theatre to    
 Bridport. The Arts Centre is in a     
 former Methodist Chapel bought in     
 1972. It is gradually being converted 
 from a mass of buildings into a single
 complex.                              
      First to be completed was the    
 main hall with a stage and dressing   
 room where visiting theatre companies 
 as well as enthusiastic amateur groups
 perform plays. Bridport Film Society  
 also meets here. Concerts, talks and  
 craft markets occur regularly.        
      There is now a new Clubroom      
 where members can meet for coffee and 
 which other groups can hire for       
 various functions. The Allsop Room    
 (named after the first president,     
 Kenneth Allsop) is a large bright     
 Exhibition room.
