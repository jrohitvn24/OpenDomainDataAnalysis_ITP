		<content> The{Blackbird Inn}which is opposite to
 the{Church}used to be a{Pele Tower}but
 is now a pub. When the Scottish       
 Raiders came down to raid Newcastle   
 they passed through Ponteland and     
 raided it. There was a{tunnel}under-  
 ground to the Church because they     
 thought it was holy ground and that   
 God would protect them. The tunnel is 
 supposed to still be there,but has not
 be found. If you go inside you will   
 see battering marks on the door where 
 the Scots tried to get in to the Pele 
 Tower. There is also supposed to be a 
 ghost of a{Victorian}boy in the pub.  
 In remembrance of a drought many years
 ago a wheelbarrow race is held on New 
 Years Day,starting at the Blackbird   
 and following a circular route. The   
 person in the barrow symbolising the  
 food and water brought back during the
 drought.                              </content>
