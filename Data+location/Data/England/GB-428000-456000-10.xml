		<title>10KILLINGHALL VILLAGE</title>
		<content>   Originally{Killinghall}was a rural  
 farming area with almost everyone     
 working on or in support of the farms 
 - milling, blacksmiths, etc. At this  
 time there were few houses, a church, 
 a pub and two shops.                  
   As better transport opened up the   
 village it developed to its' present  
 size and now only eigth farms own all 
 the agricultural land in the area.    
   It has changed to a dormitory       
 village for commuters very few        
 residents working here.  They are     
 either retired or travel to Leeds,    
 Harrogate, or Ripon.                  
   Five small housing estates have     
 increased the size of the village and 
 altered its' character. A community   
 centre has been built as well as a    
 nursing home and two sports fields,   
 three shops and a public house.
