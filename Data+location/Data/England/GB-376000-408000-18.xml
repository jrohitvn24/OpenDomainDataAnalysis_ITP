		<content> At school we sometimes play{'tig ball'
 One person has the ball and lets the  
 other people run off.Then they have to
 throw the ball at those who are       
 running about.If they are hit they are
 'on'.Another game we play is 'polo'.  
 First one person is 'on'.He or she    
 picks a subject such as 'cars',then   
 they have to turn round.The other     
 group of people pick names connected  
 with the subject such as 'Mini'.Then  
 the first person turns round and says 
 one of the names that has just been   
 picked.If they pick the name you have 
 just chosen you have to run to the    
 place where they were standing while  
 they run to  your place and then both 
 run back.{'Polo'}is shouted when the  
 run is completed.The first person to  
 shout is on.                          
{ }
