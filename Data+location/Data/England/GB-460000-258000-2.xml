		<title>02 TRANSPORT IN WEEDON</title>
		<content>  We discovered that most people in    
Weedon use a motor-car as their means  
of transport.People without cars use   
the bus service.Among the younger      
people motor-cycles are the most       
popular.                               
  The buses that call at Weedon run to 
Daventry and Northampton.Sometimes they
run to Milton Keynes.                  
  There is no coach station in the     
village,the only coaches that come     
regularly are school coaches.The school
coaches take us swimming in Daventry,or
on visits to museums or other          
interesting places.                    
  When I asked my dad he said he wanted
a Porsche.The newest car of 1985 is the
Sinclair C5 which runs on electricity. 
  Britain's first motorway,the M1,runs 
close to the village.
