		<title>16Bromham Hospital</title>
		<content> Set in 200 acres of parkland,once the 
 home of the Allen family,a residential
 hospital for 330 mentally handicapped 
 people since 1949.Here the more       
 disabled are encouraged in basic      
 feeding and dressing skills whilst    
 more able patients are trained to     
 prepare them for life in the community
 such as use of the telephone,shopping,
 getting on a bus.Over the next 10     
 years more patients will be able to   
 live within the community and numbers 
 at the hospital will fall to 200. From
 January 1986 a new project here will  
 house 16 severely disturbed patients  
 in a "home-like" environment converted
 from 3 former staff houses.Some 500   
 full-time and part-time staff work    
 here helped by the Parents and Friends
 of Bromham Hospital Association who   
 fund-raise and whose volunteers are   
 vital visitors and friends to patients</content>
