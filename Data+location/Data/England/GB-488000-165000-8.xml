		<content>   The residents of{Harmans Water}like 
 it's open spaces and plentiful play   
 areas.  There is a sadness surrounding
 the{development}of adjacent Crown     
 Estate Land for more housing and busy 
 roads.                                
   This neighbourhood is not one of    
 small children.  Many are teenagers   
 and young adults living with parents. 
  {Spare time pursuits}tend to be of   
 the homely kind, such as gardening and
 home improvement.                     
   The nearby{shops}are used only for  
 occasional purchases, being 'more     
 expensive' than the supermarkets where
 a weekly shop is the rule.  People    
 tend to travel to{Reading}to buy      
 clothes or other large items.         
   Most locals see themselves living   
 elsewhere later in life, in a coastal 
 or country environment.
