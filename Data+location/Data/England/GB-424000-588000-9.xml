		<title>09GRID SQUARE NINE</title>
		<content> There is not really much in this grid 
 other than fields and woods but there 
 is a 4.3 metres metalled road and a   
 survey of the traffic which past on a 
 1 hour survey is as follows _ 2_12    
 year old cars, 2_11 year old cars,    
 2_10 year old cars,3_9 year old cars, 
 1_8 year old car, 5_7 year old        
 cars,5_6 year old cars, 5_5 year old  
 cars, 2_4 year old cars, 5_3 year old 
 cars and 2 were 2 year old cars.      
 In the fields nearby the crops are 28%
 cereal, 40% grazing, 10% are root     
 crops and 22% is woodland. Overall    
 this is a very desolate grid square.
