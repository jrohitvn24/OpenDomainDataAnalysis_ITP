		<title>12CHANGING TIMES IN BARSBY</title>
		<content>  Many of the old residents in Barsby  
 have lived there most of thier lives. 
 they have witnessed many changes in   
 Barsby of which some they  much       
 regret. Mrs King allowed us to        
 interview her about life in Barsby.   
 Mrs King has lived in Barsby for 43   
 years and at 71 she is one of the     
 residents. Mrs King remembers the time
 before electricity and water were in  
 Barsby , when people had oil lamps and
 fetched water from a pump. Even today 
 there is no gas in Barsby. Many of the
 houses were built small and as large  
 famillies were common when Mrs King   
 first moved to Barsby, famillies had  
 to live a cramped lifestyle. There    
 used to be a bakers  and a butcher,   
 and a public house. now only the      
 public house remains. Most people     
 worked on the farms, while at the same
 time  kept pigs and hens at home.     </content>
