		<title>10Hartfield Church</title>
		<content>   Hartfield C.E. church is over 700   
 years old,but a wooden building is    
 believed to have been here for 200    
 years before this. The church has a   
 square tower with a spire added in the
 15th Century.The spire has wooden     
 tiles.We measured it to be 127'high.  
 Inside the tower are six bells which  
 were cast in 1782. The church has a   
 nave,chancel,organ,vestry,side chapel 
 south aisle and font. There is also a 
 choir and belfry.A large porch is     
 attached to the north door.Above the  
 west door is a large clock which      
 strikes the quarter hours.There is a  
 nice weather vane on top of the spire.
   The church is surrounded by a grave-
 yard which is well kept.              
   Three buildings are near by:-The    
 Rectory,which is Queen Anne,the schol 
 which is Victorian, and Lych-Gate     
 Cottage which is largely Tudor.       </content>
