		<content>    Livestock farming has decreased.   
 Farmers today tend to specialise so   
 there are fewer mixed farms. Given    
 such fertile soil and a low level of  
 rainfall, most of the grassland has   
 been ploughed up and used for crops.  
    More{chemicals}are used to kill    
 weeds and to control pests and        
 diseases. The wheat crop, for example,
 is sprayed five times annually with a 
 mixture of chemicals. Money paid on   
 chemicals for one farm alone in 1985  
 amounted to{Â£64,000.}The use of       
 chemicals has meant that better plant 
 varieties can be developed and grown. 
    More{machinery}is used on the farms
 now. In one instance the number of men
 has fallen from{30}to now only{6.}The 
 work of men and horses has been taken 
 over by machines such as combine      
 harvesters, beet harvesters and       
 tractors. Horses were used up to 1960.</content>
