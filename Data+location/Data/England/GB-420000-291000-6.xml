		<content>    The Gate Inn was established over  
 250 years ago. It serves not only as a
 public house but also as a base for   
 the local Riding Club.                
    The Dog Inn dates from 1520.It     
 retains much of the old-world charm   
 with beams and a low ceiling.         
    The Railway Public House was       
 formerly known as the Railway Hotel.  
 It has a functions room at the rear &amp; 
 an adjoining field. Across the road   
 was a Railway Station which was       
 eventually demolished and replaced by 
 a station near the waterworks. This   
 station was demolished in the late    
 sixties.                              
    The Swan was originally a coaching 
 inn. Earlier in the century a fair was
 held annually on the paddock next to  
 the Swan.
