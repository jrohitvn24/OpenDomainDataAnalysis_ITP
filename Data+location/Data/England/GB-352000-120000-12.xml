		<content>   We have a{Cub meeting}one evening a 
 week.My pack has{16 boys.}We call our 
 leaders Arkala, Barloo and Sherkhan   
 from the "Jungle book" stories.       
{  Inspection}comes first, when our    
 uniforms are checked and our hands(to 
 see that they are clean).Each sixer   
 (group of 6 cubs)tries to be the best.
 Then we play some group{games}for a   
 little while.                         
{  Badge work}comes next.We discuss the
 badges we are trying for and what we  
 have to do.I liked the mapreading one.
   In summer we often meet outside to  
 play games like{cricket;}or have a    
{camp fire}and cook our own supper. And
 we have a{cub camp}that lasts for     
 several days. I like sleeping in a    
 tent with my friends!                 
   At the end of the meeting we join in
 a circle to{sing}some cub songs before
 we are dismissed by Arkala.           </content>
