		<title>04Fire Station, Whitfield</title>
		<content>The fire station was opened by Right   
Honorable Countess of Guilford on May  
18th 1960 and stands on the Sandwich   
Road, between the library and          
Beauxfield.                            
The 'Dennis' fire engine and 16 firemen
cover the area of West Langdon,        
Coldred, Sibertswold, Denton, Ewell    
Minnis, Aylesham, River and Temple     
Ewell. They have a telex machine in the
office and each man has a pocket       
bleeper. It is an unmanned station.    
One of the firemen's full-time         
occupation is as a train driver and has
been a fireman for 17 years. The       
funniest call-out was about 16 years   
ago at Adisham where a house and garden
were under 2 feet of water. The owner  
of the land came towards the firemen   
whilst holding a sieve and bucket in   
his hand and asked, "Do you think you  
could help me rescue my goldfish?"     </content>
