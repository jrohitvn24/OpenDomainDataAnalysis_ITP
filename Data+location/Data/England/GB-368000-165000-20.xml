 popular.There are many kinds of music 
 "pop""robotics", "body-popping"and    
 "break-dancing", each type of music   
 has its own kind of dancing."Pop" is  
 mostly swaying the body and a bit of  
 footwork."Robotics" is jerky music    
 where you have to act like a          
 robot."Body-popping" is really pop but
 you dance around more. "Break-dance"  
 is mostly a floor dance,the moves are 
 to make you think the dancers are     
 crazy because they spin on their heads
 and somersault. Most of the musical   
 instruments are electric and some of  
 the key-board instruments can be made 
 to sound like any other instrument.   
 About a quarter of 11 year olds       
 regularly buy pop records.

 which are popular with different age  
 groups-classical,folk,jazz,chamber etc</content>
