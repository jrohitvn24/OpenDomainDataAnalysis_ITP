		<title>03Planning the proposed M40</title>
		<content>  Planning for the M40 started in 1969 
 and by 1985 the final route had been  
 settled upon.                         
  Construction will commence in 1987   
 and it will be opened in 1991.        
  The traffic that will use it is      
 expected to be travelling from        
 Birmingham to London and from the N.W.
 to Southampton and vice versa. This   
 motor way will effect the current     
 traffic flows on the M1,M6, and A41.  
  The motorway will be 57 miles long   
 and will cost Â£220 000 000. It will   
 take up 520 hectares of land but only 
 3 properties will be destroyed.       
  There will be a service station every
 30 Miles, so one will be between      
 Gaydon and Birmingham. Instead of     
 building service stations on the      
 motorway, it is planned to construct  
 them where the motorway crosses a     
 trunk road.                           </content>
