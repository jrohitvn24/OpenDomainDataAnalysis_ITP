		<title>05    YOUTH PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> In the Kingstanding area of the block,
 one of the main social concerns is the
 number of teenage{gangs}operating.They
 have special names and meeting places.
{75% of arrests}made are of young      
 people{under seventeen}for fighting,  
 shoplifting, damage and burglary. The 
 number of police officers on beat duty
 used to be four but now it is sixteen.
 One boy of twelve, who was caught     
 stealing two bicycles, admitted to    
 fifty-three shed burglaries of goods  
 worth over Â£2,500.                    
   When the gangs were asked why they  
 did such things they said it was      
 because they had nothing else to do.  
 Now, the local police, with social    
 workers, probation officers and people
 from welfare and education are trying 
 to raise money to start{youth clubs}  
 and for{a gym and sports hall}to help 
 solve the problem.                    </content>
