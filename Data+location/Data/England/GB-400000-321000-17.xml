Colwich School was founded in 1827 by  
Charlotte Sparrow, at that time for    
boys only. It admitted girls in 1860.  
It was church endowed until 1935 when  
they found that running costs could not
be met, and so it became County        
property. Originally an all age school,
children from Gt.Haywood transferred   
there at the age of 11. With the       
opening of the new Secondary School at 
nearby Hixon, it formally became a     
Primary School in 1958. In 1975 the    
buildings were extended to accomodate  
the growing school population which    
would arise from the housing           
development that was beginning in      
Lt.Haywood. This included a large hall,
3 classrooms, a kitchen and offices.   
In 1985 the school has 220 children on 
roll and 9 full time teaching staff.
