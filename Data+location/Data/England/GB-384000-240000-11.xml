		<title>11Early Travel in Upton.</title>
		<content>{River crossing}was by{ferry,}later a  
 wooden bridge.  A stone bridge of six 
 arches came later in the 17th cent.   
 Upton grew and prospered in the mid   
 16th cent. building timber framed     
 houses with profits from fishing and  
 farming.  The quay was used to load   
 and unload goods and produce from     
 surrounding areas and tea from China  
 for{Upton Tea Exchange.}The Severn    
 Trow was used.  A swing bridge was    
 built in 1854 after the collapse of   
 the stone one damaged in the Civil    
 War.  With no roads existing for many 
 centuries overland transport was by   
 pack horse. {Roman}roads existed from 
 AD43. By the 18th cent. roads were    
 made encouraging stage coach travel   
 with posting inns, the Star and the   
 White Lion. Railways replaced horse   
 transport and the coming of motors    
 closed the railways.                  </content>
