		<title>08Houses in Easton</title>
		<content> Easton consists of{both old and new   
 houses. The old houses have been there
 since{1934,}many of which have        
 been pulled down. The council houses  
 along the Dereham road were{rebuilt in
{1934}and since then have been         
 renovated on the outside. The church  
 is one of the oldest buildings, being 
 built around the{14th century.        
                                       
  Many old{coach houses, stable blocks 
{and barns}have been converted into    
 modern country residences.
