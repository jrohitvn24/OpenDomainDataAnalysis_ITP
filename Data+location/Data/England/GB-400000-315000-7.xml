		<title>07Dangers on Cannock Chase</title>
		<content>  Most of the{dangers to animals,}on   
Cannock Chase, are caused by men.      
  Poachers hunt the deer. Nearby       
farmers may use harmful sprays on      
their crops. The roads on Cannock      
Chase are dangerous for wild animals.  
Cars sometimes go so fast that they    
cannot stop if a deer runs out.        
  As Cannock Chase is a                
{natural beauty spot} it is visited by 
many people especially in summer.      
Litter can cause problems. Crisp       
bags and polythene wrappers may seem   
like food to animals and they may eat  
them and suffocate or choke.           
  Broken glass may cause injuries or   
start fires, and carelessness with     
matches and cigarettes can also cause  
fires especially in Spring and         
Summer, when the Chase is dry.
