 There are many facilities in Upminster
 for both investing and borrowing      
 money. Perhaps this is a reflection of
 our middle class catchment area. Most 
 people are paid either by cheque or   
 directly into their bank account.     
                                       
 All the major banks are represented   
 together with all the leading building
 societies. Within our local shopping  
 area there are 5 banks{_National      
{Westminster,Lloyds,Barclays,Midland   
 and the{Trustee Savings Bank.}There   
 are 16 building societies, some of    
 which are counter services within     
 estate agents.                        
                                       
 Most people buying their homes are    
 doing so with a building society      
 mortgage.
