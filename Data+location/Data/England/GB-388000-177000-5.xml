		<content>     There are five more modern housing
 estates (approx.15 years old) in the  
 village.Four of these are cul-de-sacs,
 and are called The Ridings,The        
 Close,The Ham and The Orchard.The     
 fifth is Town Close,which is a group  
 of council houses.                    
     Most of the buildings in the      
 village are made of either natural or 
 imitation stone.                      
     At the south-east end of the      
 village is Stubbs Lane.On the corner  
 of this lane are the Village Hall,The 
 Old School,and the Post Office.Here   
 also are the Church, the Manor,and a  
 little further down the lane,the      
 Rectory.                              
     In the main street are also a pub,
 The Jolly Huntsman,a Working Mens Club
 and some very old (1675) almshouses.  
     The village now has a population  
 of about 700 people.                  </content>
