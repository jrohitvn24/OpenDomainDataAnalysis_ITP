		<content> The School and School house were built
 in 1839.Classes before then were held 
 in the Church tower.Pupils have always
 travelled in from nearby towns.Owing  
 to changing methods in farming and the
 reduction of the school leaving age in
 Primary schools to 11 the roll has    
 steadily decreased.In 1880 there were 
 4 teachers and 150 pupils aged up to  
 14.Now there are 2.2 teachers and 21  
 pupils.There is 1 part time care taker
 ,1 mid-day assistant,1 canteen super- 
 visor and 1 part time secretary.There 
 is oil fired central heating and elec-
 tric lighting.Toilet facilities are   
 still primitive.The meals are brought 
 in from Crewe.School opens at 9.0am   
 but as 70% travel in ,school seldom   
 starts on time.There is a mid morning 
 and a mid afternoon break and lunch is
 taken at 12.Most children bring sand- 
 wiches.School ends atb 3.30 pm.       </content>
