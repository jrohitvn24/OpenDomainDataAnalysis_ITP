		<title>05Worsley Hall Farm</title>
		<content> Worsley Hall Farm is near to the Old  
 Hall. It was originally used as a stud
 farm for the Old Hall. The farm covers
 240 acres. It has 200 cows which are  
 fattened up and slaughtered. 400 sheep
 are also kept. The lambs are          
 slaughtered when they are a few weeks 
 old. Mr Fitton owns 10 horses of his  
 own and has stables which he hires    
 out. Barley and hay are grown to feed 
 the animals. Mr Fitton runs the farm, 
 Bridgewater Estates owns it. In July  
 Mr Fitton buys turkeys to be fatteden 
 up for Christmas. He kills them and   
 plucks them himself. Cattle are fed   
 cattlenuts as well as barley and hay. 
 The farm will be smaller in the future
 as houses are to be built on the other
 side of the East Lancs Road.
