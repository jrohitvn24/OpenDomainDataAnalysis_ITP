		<title>20CHILD'S POEM  I AM</title>
		<content> I am the slowest one in our family.   
 My dad is the fastest                 
 But I am the slowest one in the family
 I am the slowest at eating my dinner. 
 My brother is the fastest in the      
 school but I am slowest at everything.
 Mum is the one who never runs very    
 fast                                  
 But even she is faster than me.       
 You see I will never become the       
 fastest in our family.                
 Why don't I practice then I may become
 The fastest in our family.
