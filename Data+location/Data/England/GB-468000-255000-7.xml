		<content> This farm in Rothersthore belongs to  
Mr Dickens. It was built approximately 
in the 17 hundreds.                    
 Mr Dickens gets up at about 6.30am to 
start his daily work and his day is    
completed when he goes to bed at       
approximately 11pm.                    
 Mr Dickens has 148 animals on the     
farm, 22 cattle.                       
 He has only 3 helpers on the farm and 
these are part-time.
