		<content>{Chicken Farm:}A large battery type    
 chicken farm is built at Weston Lane  
 between the A3 and the railway.  Large
 notices at gates forbid entrance due  
 to risk of disease. {Causeway Farm:   
 This has recently become a riding     
 stable, and its farmland sold off to  
 other farmers. {Fairfield Farm:}This  
 is now the Broadway Park Homes estate.
 175 compact homes, each with their own
 plot of land form the park.  Each plot
 is rented from the estate but the     
 occupier owns the home.  Most of the  
 occupiers are retired people since one
 of the conditions of the park does not
 allow children or dogs.  3 large      
 fields surrounding the homes are used 
 to produce grass for outside          
 contractors.  Some sheep are brought  
 in at the end of the season.{         
{Horticulture:}A nursery is expanding  
 at North Lane, Buriton.               </content>
