		<title>01BURGHFIELD COMMON-INTRO.</title>
		<content> This grid lies in the heart of rural  
 Berkshire.The main settlement is      
 Burghfield Common,which is part of the
 Newbury District Council area,and lies
 on the main road between Reading and  
 Aldermaston, where there is a research
 centre.The village,which is located on
 a ridge about eight miles from Reading
 ,once consisted of only a few large   
 houses,but was rapidly expanded in the
 1950s,partly by the Ministry of       
 Defence to house employees of the     
 Royal Ordnance Factory at Burghfield. 
 Further development has increased the 
 village's importance.                 
  The grid also contains many small    
 hamlets,such as Sulhamstead Abbots and
 Wokefield.Whilst Burghfield Common    
 lies in wild heath and woodland,these 
 hamlets are located in the nearby rich
 pastoral and arable farmland.
