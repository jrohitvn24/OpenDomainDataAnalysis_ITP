		<title>09FORTON VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The village hall in Forton was        
 formerly the old school building but  
 in 1965 when the third and final phase
 of the new school was completed it was
 taken over for village activities. The
 original old school was constructed in
 1878 and consisted of 2 classrooms,   
 which could be separated by a         
 partition or opened out as a full     
 hall,and the headmaster's house. Since
 1965 it has been used for all sorts of
 village functions:_dances and discos, 
 concerts,meetings of the Parish       
 Council,Mothers' Union,Over 60's etc, 
 as well as being used for refreshments
 on Forton Field Day. In May 1985 work 
 was commenced to extend the hall as it
 was no longer big enough . The front  
 facade of the hall will remain but the
 interior will be completely gutted to 
 provide larger and more modern        
 accommodation, including a stage.     </content>
