 LOCAL HISTORY;  FROG HALL.            
 So called because of the hemp pits    
 which are here, the hemp pits were the
 breeding place for frogs  and toads.  
 When the garden was devolped it       
 incorporated a  fairly large rockery  
 pond which has since been adopted by  
 the frogs and toads as their breeding 
 place.                                
 Each year they return in there        
 hundreds to perform their short       
 courtship and mating rituals,         
 departing afterwards as swiftly as    
 they come.                            
 The area which accommodated the       
 original hemps has been turned into   
 padocks.
