		<content> The village is a mixture of{old}and   
{new.}The{old}village-stone built      
 cottages,workshops,shops,courtyards   
 and pub are based around the Parish   
 Church towards the south of the       
 village.The{new}housing,council       
 hpuses,modern shops and schools have  
 been built on previously good farmland
 to the north of the main road through 
 the village.Most of the houses,gardens
 and streets are kept tidy and         
 attractive and the older part of      
{Kirkheaton}still keeps a touch of     
 "olde worlde" character.Talking to an 
 elderly lady she said"I have lived in 
{Kirkheaton}all my life and remember it
 as lots of green fields,farms and     
 everyone knowing everyone else.The new
 houses have spoiled it and there is   
 too much vandalism although we now    
 have lots of different shops and there
 is no need to trail into{Huddersfield"</content>
