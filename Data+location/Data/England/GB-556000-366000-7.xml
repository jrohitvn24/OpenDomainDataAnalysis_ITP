		<title>07Beach Survey</title>
		<content> Sixtythree families were interviewed  
 and we found most of them came from   
 the East Midlands,but some came from  
 as far away as Scotland.All except 2  
 were on holiday for at least a week,  
 mainly staying in a holiday camp or   
 caravans.The majority had been at     
 least twice before saying that as they
 had come with children,they valued the
 amenities available for them,and the  
 fact they obtained value for money.   
 Most of them were on the beach because
 the children liked digging and        
 building in the sand, or paddling and 
 swimming in the sea.The adults found  
 it good to relax and sun bathe.Forty  
 two of the 63 families cooked their   
 own meals but at times bought take    
 away food or had meals out.The        
 favourite evening pastimes seemed to  
 be visiting a show or a public house  
 after having enjoyed a walk by the sea</content>
