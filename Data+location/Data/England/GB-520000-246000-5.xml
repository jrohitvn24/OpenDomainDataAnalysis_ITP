		<title>05A DAY AT SUTTON SCHOOL</title>
		<content> I live in Sutton and go to the village
 school.In the morning I get up,get    
 dressed and have my breakfast.Then I  
 get ready for school.I go to school in
 my mummy's car.When I get there,I play
 in the playground until 9 o'clock when
 we go in and have assembly.After that 
 we do some lessons like mathematics   
 and English.At 10-45am we have        
 playtime.I like to play with my       
 friends or go on the climbing         
 frame.After play,we do some more work 
 until 12 o'clock when we have         
 lunch.Most children bring a packed    
 lunch but some have a school meal     
 which is brought from Southlands      
 School in Biggleswade.We play until   
 1-15pm and then have afternoon school.
 In the afternoon we often do painting,
 craft or needlework.At 3 o'clock we   
 have a story and go home at 3-30pm.
