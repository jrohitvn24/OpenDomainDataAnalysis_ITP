		<title>11THE SEVERN STOKE LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>    The villages of Severn Stoke and   
 Kinnersley are sited in a gently      
 undulating{agricultural landscape}of  
 crop land and cultivated grass. The   
 tree cover is sporadic, concentrated  
 for the most part in Cliffey Wood and 
 Croome Park. The River Severn winds   
 its way through the south_west corner 
 of the area.                          
    The local{architecture}is a mixture
 of styles and ages, from the many     
 black and white Elizabethan timbered  
 farm houses to the modern rectangular 
 brick buildings of the new housing    
 estates and bungalows. The church of  
 St. Denys is typical of the Saxon     
 period.                               
    Two notable buildings are the old  
 sadle house on the A38 south of Severn
 Stoke and the Panorama on Knights     
 hill, both built by the Earl of       
 Coventry in the last century.         </content>
