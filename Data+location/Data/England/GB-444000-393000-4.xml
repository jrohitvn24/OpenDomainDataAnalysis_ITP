		<content>{Silverwood Colliery}has{two shafts}to 
 go underground. These two shafts were 
 dug in{1900}and the{first coal}to come
 out of the pit was in{1905.}There have
 been two{Royal Visits}to Silverwood.  
 The first one was in{1912}when{King   
{George V}visited it and the second    
 was in{1975}when{Queen Elizabeth II, }
 our present Queen went there. The     
{largest area}of coal was the{Barnsley 
 seam, which gave coal for over{fifty  
{years.}They now work at the{Swallow   
{Wood}seam, which is two metres  deep. 
 Each week it produces{seven thousand  
 tons. There are more than{thirty      
{million tons left}to keep them going. 
 The coal from Silverwood goes to      
 various places. Three quarters of it  
 goes to{British Steel}and the         
 remainder goes to power stations and  
 houses and homes to provide heating   
 and hot water.                        </content>
