		<title>13STREET NAMES, HOCKLIFFE</title>
		<content> Many road names are informative       
 telling us to which{village}or{town}  
 they are leading, e.g.{Woburn}Road,   
{Tebworth}Road,{Leighton}Road and      
{Hockliffe}Road.                       
  Others have interesting origins.     
{Manor Close}gets its name from the old
 manor which once stood there. The     
 most recent street,{Hockley Court,}was
 given its name because the old name   
 for Hockliffe was{Hockley in the Hole.
{Goose Green Lane}leads up to the green
 and was so called because geese used  
 to be kept there.{Whitehorse Close}is 
 named after the{Old White Horse Inn   
 that still stands and now sells old   
 timbers and antique fireplaces. The   
{A5,}also known as{Watling Street,}is  
 an old{Roman Road}and runs through    
 Hockliffe. It is sometimes called     
{Chester Road,}since it runs from      
{London (Londinium)}to{Chester (Deva). </content>
