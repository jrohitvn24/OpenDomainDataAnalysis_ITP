		<content> Doddinghurst provides a variety of    
 housing ranging from a one-bedroom    
 cottage, which pre-war, was the main  
 housing in Doddinghurst, to a recently
 renovated 16th Century Grade 2 farm-  
 house in Outings Lane, which is now   
 on the market for Â£240,000.           
   In our survey we found that{92% of  
{the houses were privately owned,}there
 are two small council estates but many
 of these houses have been bought by   
 the tenants.                          
  Twice as many houses in the area are 
 detached as semi-detached. Only the   
 council houses are terraced.{All have 
{a garden.}Some roads are not supplied 
 with gas.                             
  The majority of people have moved    
 here from the London Boroughs, and    
 once here, prefer to move within the  
 village or extend their house, rather 
 than move away.                       </content>
