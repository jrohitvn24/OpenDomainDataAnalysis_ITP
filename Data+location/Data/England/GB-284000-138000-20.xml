		<title>20St. Mary Magdelene, Exford.</title>
		<content>  The church is at the top of the hill.
 It has a grave yard in which stands   
 the remains of an old stone cross     
 where people used to meet.The church  
 is built of local stone.It has a tower
 with a spiral stair case which is     
 probably the oldest part of the       
 building (500 yrs old).On the tower is
 a clock,and inside are 6 bells.About  
 200 people could fit in the pews.There
 are hymn books for singing with the   
 organ.The screen came from St Audries 
 and was found in a barn.After         
 restoration,cleaning and measurement  
 Exford was the only church it         
 fitted.In winter the church is heated 
 and electric lights are used in the   
 evenings.Our Rector has 4 churches in 
 his care,so there is only 1 service a 
 week on Sundays.There are also        
 marriages, baptisms and burials       
 conducted at church.                  </content>
