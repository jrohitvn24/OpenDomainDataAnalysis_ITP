		<title>10HAVERGAL FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>    Many visitors come from all over   
 the world to see her grave and each   
 year, on the Sunday nearest the       
 anniversary of her death, a service is
 held at which her hymns are sung.{On  
{the centenary of her death, 3rd June  
{1879, a special Festival was held in  
{her memory.}Twenty-five related       
 Havergals were at the service and     
 later that month the{Choir of HAVERGAL
{COLLEGE, TORONTO, CANADA,}sang in the 
 church. The College was founded by men
 who admired her principles.           
                                       
    Part of the money raised by the    
 Festival was used to{re-gild}the two  
 faces of{the church clock}which had   
 been erected in January 1836 by her   
 father.
