		<title>04THE RIVER STOUR</title>
		<content>{ The River Stour}flows north through  
 our area to join the River Avon at    
 Stratford. Some parts of Shipston-on  
 Stour are flooded when there is a lot 
 of rain.                              
  We asked some members of the Angling 
 Society about the river.              
  These{fish}are caught in the Stour:  
 Dace,Trout,Pike,Roach,Minnow,Tench,   
 Eel,Perch,Chub,Stickleback,Roach,     
 Bull-head,Daddy-Ruff and Gudgeon.There
 are more fish in the river now than   
 in the past.Tench and Roach are quite 
 new to the river.The water is too     
 shallow for Bream or Barbel.          
   There are not many{Herons}by the    
 river,but there are{Kingfishers}by The
 Mill.There are Moorhens and several   
 types of duck,such as Mallard.        
{ Otters}died out in the 1950s because 
 they were hunted by otter hounds.
