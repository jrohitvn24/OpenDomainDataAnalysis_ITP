		<title>01Head of Cerne River Valley</title>
		<content> This grid is set on part of the       
 escarpment of the North Dorset Downs, 
 which rises to a height at the Little 
 Minterne Hill of 261mtrs.The area has 
 a chalk geology and consequently has  
 little surface drainage. The only     
 example of flurial processes atwork is
 the River Cerne which has eroded its  
 base in its upper stages, to leave    
 upstanding escapments on either side f
 the valley. This has meant that in the
 valley arable farming takes place,    
 while the escarpments only allow rough
 grazing for sheep and cattle. The     
 arable fields are enclosed by hedges, 
 while the escarpments need less       
 enclosure. The farms in this area are 
 of commercial nature, they are highly 
 mechanised and hence do not need many 
 hands. Hence this area employs a small
 agricultural workforce and has a low  
 population density.                   </content>
