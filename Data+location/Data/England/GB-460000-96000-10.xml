		<content>      My visit to the Children's Ward  
 was arranged by Mrs Deacon,our        
 headteacher's wife  who works as a    
 home tutor to the sick children. We   
 visited the 'galley' where meals were 
 served and met some of the children in
 their 'cabins'(or wards).             
      The most common injuries were    
 those sustained to the head. The      
 children have lots of toys and a      
 special playroom as well as their own 
 T.V.  They have a routine and their   
 day starts at around 6am. The children
 can choose what they would like to eat
 from a wide menu.Bedtime is around    
 7pm. I thought the caps that the      
 nurses wore very strange - they have 7
 pleats for the 7 seas!                
      We were lucky to visit the       
 hospital's museum and library and saw 
 some amazing exhibits.
