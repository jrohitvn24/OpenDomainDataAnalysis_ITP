		<title>12LOCAL HISTORY GREAT DUNMOW</title>
		<content> The village gets it's name from the   
 Saxon days when it was 'Dunemowe'which
 meant hill meadow.There was a Roman   
 road through the village and Roman    
 remains have been found under our     
 school field,it has always been an    
 agricultural area.At the time of the  
 Domesday Book,Dunmow had 7 manors with
 a number of small houses and a        
 population of 700.Today there is only 
 1 Manor and the population is         
 5,500.Church End like the High Street,
 is a conservation area.In earlier days
 it was separated from the town because
 the Causeway was a large marsh area   
 which was impassable.All buildings    
 along the Causeway except the Clock   
 House were built after the 18th       
 Century.Doctor's Pond can be found by 
 The Downs,it got it's name because a  
 doctor stocked the pond with fish.The 
 first lifeboat was tested here in 1803</content>
