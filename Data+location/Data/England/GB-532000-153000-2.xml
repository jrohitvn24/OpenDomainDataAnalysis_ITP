		<title>02CATERHAM VALLEY</title>
		<content>    Caterham Valley is situated on the 
 northern slopes of the {NORTH DOWNS.} 
 It is a terminus for a branch line of 
 British Rail, which was a spur to the 
 development of the area. It is used   
 for commuting to Croydon and London by
 many people.                          
                                       
    The valley is  a shopping centre   
 with a wide variety of shops. The main
 food shop is {WAITROSE,}there are many
 others. My favourite shop is{DITTO,}it
 sells posters, stationery, rubbers and
 lots of other nice things.            
                                       
    The valley also has the local      
 police station.
