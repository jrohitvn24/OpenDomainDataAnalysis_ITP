 The name Skelton comes from the Anglo-
 Saxon meaning the village on the      
 shelf. The Church in the village is   
 called St. Michael's. Parts of the    
 church date from 1299 but the last    
 major rebuilding took place in the    
 18th century.                         
 King Edward I came to Skelton Church  
 on his way to do battle with the      
 Scots.                                
 A wealthy local man, named Fred       
 Toppin, with American connections gave
 the money to build the Village Hall.  
 Many of the older houses have interest
 -ing histories eg. Lamonby Hall and   
 Hardrigg Hall, the latter having a    
 pele tower.
