		<title>16Old St Mary's Church, Walmer</title>
		<content> Old St Mary's Church (circa 1120) was 
 owned by the{d'Auberville}family and  
 was the Parish Church. The Church was 
 enlarged twice, in 1816 and again in  
 1826, but was restored to the original
 size in{1897}after a new church was   
 built to house the large congregation 
 in 1888. The{tower}of the old church  
 was added to the new and a pinnacle   
 with a bell made by{Joseph Hatch}was  
 erected in its place. The oldest      
 tombstone in the 3.5 acre graveyard   
 belonged to{John Basset,}a Gunner of  
 Walmer Castle who died in 1680. An    
 immense{yew tree,}still standing near 
 to the Church Porch, is probably as   
 old as the Church. On one stained     
 glass window,{St Elizabeth of Hungary 
 is pictured giving food to the poor.  
 One day she met her husband and the   
 meal in her lap turned to roses.      
 There is a{font}dating from 1664.     </content>
