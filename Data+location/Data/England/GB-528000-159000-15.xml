		<title>15The Dentist - Purley</title>
		<content>   My dentist is in Purley and I visit 
 him every four months.                
   If I need a filling or have a tooth 
 out he gives me an injection in my gum
 so that there will be no pain.        
   For a filling he drills a hole in my
 tooth then a lady sucks up all the    
 little bits in my mouth with a tiny   
 hoover and finally the filling stuff  
 is pushed into the hole.              
   The whole thing takes about twenty  
 minutes and sometimes it hurts a bit. 
   Another part of dental treatment is 
 fluoride treatment. This is a         
 substance which is put on children's  
 teeth by the Dental Hygienist to keep 
 them free from decay.                 
   My parents do not have to pay for my
 visits to the dentist because I am a  
 child and I get it on the National    
 Health Service.
