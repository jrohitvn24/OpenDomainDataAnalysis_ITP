		<content> The region is classified as prime     
 agricultural land in the Kent Struct- 
 ure Plan so no new building is allowed
 apart from infilling in already deve- 
 loped residential areas.              
 There is one listed building, Upton   
 House, Worth, built in the l8th. cen- 
 tury. The present owners have Dover   
 District Council planning permission  
 to turn it into an Old People's Home. 
 The Martha Trust at The Elms, Hack-   
 linge have plans to turn outbuildings 
 into an eight-bedded Home for Mentally
 and Physically Handicapped Children.  
 Although no new building is allowed   
 plans to convert old barns and similar
 structures for residential use are    
 invariably passed unless local opin-  
 ions are strongly against them.
