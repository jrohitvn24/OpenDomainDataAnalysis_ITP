		<title>07Greve de Lecq Barracks</title>
		<content>    At Greve de lecq there are six     
 buildings which make up Greve de Lecq 
 barracks. The Jersey militia were     
 stationed here in times past. They    
 slept there and kept their horses in  
 stables. Now, it is a museum and,     
 while camping nearby, our class paid  
 them a visit.                         
                                       
   We saw original soldiers beds made  
 from straw, helmets, photographs, a   
 medical box, ablutions (wash house)   
 with water pump (it was covered in    
 algae). There was also a gift shop and
 nine old Jersey carriages. It is owned
 by the National Trust for Jersey and  
 visiting times are Tuesday to Friday  
 in the summer. Admission is 25p for   
 adults and 10p for children.
