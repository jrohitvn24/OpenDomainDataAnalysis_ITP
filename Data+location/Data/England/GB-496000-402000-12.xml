		<title>12Sargents Ice Cream</title>
		<content> We visited Sargents factory located on
 Brigg road, the main through route to 
 Brigg.This is a family company started
 by Mr Sargents father in 1936 on this 
 site because it was simply the only   
 one available.Originally the cost was 
 Â£2000 ,garages were added later.      
 Present day problems with this site   
 are the high rates compared with the  
 industrial estate in Brigg, and the   
 distance from centres of population.  
 The main enterprise is the production 
 and sales of dairy ice-cream. The     
 business is seasonal,most of the sales
 taking place in the summer.The labour 
 force changes from 3 full time and 7  
 part-time to 2 full and 2 part-time.  
 The majority of the workers come from 
 outside the village from Scunthorpe,  
 Brigg,Scawby,Messingham and Bonby. The
 company is dependant on raw materials 
 from outside the village.             </content>
