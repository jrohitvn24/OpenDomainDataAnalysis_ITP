		<title>18THE PROPOSED NEW BY-PASS.</title>
		<content> A new road plan has been forwarded    
 which will help traffic congestion in 
 Shrewsbury. The route will, at one    
 point, pass just to the west of Gains 
 Park housing estate, which is on our  
 Domesday Block. We have studied the   
 proposed route in relation to the     
 estate. The road would provide quick  
 and easy access from the estate to    
 such places as Telford. It would be   
 particularly helpful for getting to   
 the Telford Shopping Centre. At       
 present cars have to use an already   
 busy by-pass(built in 1931) or travel 
 through the town centre itself.       
 Possible disadvantages to residents of
 the estate would be from noise and    
 pollution. Alternative routes are also
 under consideration, namely the Yellow
 Plan, the Red plan and the Anti-Green 
 Plan. The results of a public enquiry 
 should be known in August 1985.       </content>
