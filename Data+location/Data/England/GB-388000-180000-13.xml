		<content>    Gabriel Wicks was an old man of    
 Hullavington, who was a hurdle        
 maker,and did odd jobs for people.    
 When he was a young man he went to    
 Bradfield Farm with some thatching    
 spars.Farmer Swete asked him to do a  
 job for him.He wanted extra storage   
 for grain and he had decided to use an
 empty room in the disused part of the 
 house,but the window was broken and he
 wanted Wicks to board it up.Wicks was 
 not aware that it was in the shape    
 a church window.Wicks measured        
 the window and prepared the wood.While
 he was nailing it up he thought how   
 gloomy it was.He had nailed the last  
 nail into place when he heard a laugh 
 and the wood fell out.Swete made him  
 nail it again but it fell out         
 once more.They ran away into the      
 orchard.Wicks later pulled the room   
 down and nobody knows where it was.   </content>
