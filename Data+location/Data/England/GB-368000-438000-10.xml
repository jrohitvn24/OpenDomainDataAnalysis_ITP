		<content>   The Parish of Mitton has 3 parts:   
 Aighton, Bailey and Chaighley.        
   In 1066, Aighton, which contains    
 Stonyhurst, was owned by Tostig,      
 brother of King Harold.               
   After 1066 Roger of Poitou owned the
 land until Henry 1 gave it to Robert  
 de Lacy in 1102.                      
   In 1135 Ralph le Rous took over     
 control and the land was sold by his  
 family 150 years later to the Earl of 
 Lincoln.                              
   In 1329 the land was granted to Sir 
 John de Shireburne. The Shireburne    
 male-line died out, but the son of    
 Richard Bayley and Margaret Shireburne
 took Shireburne as his surname.In 1538
 Richard Shireburne inherited the land 
 and held it for 60 years. He was      
 knighted in 1544 and became an M.P. in
 the time of Mary 1.
