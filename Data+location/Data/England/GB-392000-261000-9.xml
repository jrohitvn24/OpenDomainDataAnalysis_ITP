		<title>09BRICK  WORKS</title>
		<content> Near the canal are the remains of     
 brickworks. These were pulled down    
 about 12 years ago. It was a very sad 
 day for the workers because they had  
 worked there for a very long time and 
 they were going to lose their jobs.   
 They saddest part was said to be the  
 day the chimney was knocked down      
 because it had been a landmark for so 
 long. The very last thing was for the 
 workers to be given their wages for   
 that part of the week they had worked.
     The area is now used as a waste   
 tip.
