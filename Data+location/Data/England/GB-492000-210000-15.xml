		<title>15The Station at Tring</title>
		<content>    In 1837 a large number of people   
 in Tring sent a petition to the London
 and Birmingham Railway Company.They   
 wanted their station to be built at   
 Pendley, not Pitstone Green. William  
 Kay, the owner of Tring Park and of   
 Silk Mill where 600 people worked,    
 said that he would send all his goods 
 by train if they would do as the      
 deputation asked.The company replied  
 that they would do so ,if the people  
 of Tring would themselves help to buy 
 the land for the station. Tring       
 station was designed by George        
 Aitcheson and built by W.L Cubitt(the 
  main contractors of the line from    
 Kings Langley to Tring)it was,after   
 all,easier to run the railway line    
 from the town-and cheaper.The present 
 position of the station makes it      
  inconvenient for today's commuter    
 being 1 mile from the town centre.    </content>
