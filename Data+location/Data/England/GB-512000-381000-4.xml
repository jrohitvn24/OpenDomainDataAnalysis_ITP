		<content>    This block is not totally devoid of
 woodland, but has few large stands.   
 The woods are mainly deciduous hard-  
 woods, planted either as fox coverts  
 after late eighteenth century         
 Enclosure, or as shelter belts around 
 isolated farms. These woods contain   
 oak, ash, beech and sycamore. There   
 are a few elm trees left, but most of 
 these have been killed off by Dutch   
 Elm Disease during the last decade.   
 There are a number of alder trees     
 along the becks. There are also       
 isolated, mature trees in the hedge-  
 rows. Such hedges as remain are mainly
 hawthorn, but there are some ancient  
 hedgerows, e.g. at{Collow,}which      
 contain hawthorn, blackthorn, field-  
 maple, oak, guelder rose, elder and   
 sweet-briar.
