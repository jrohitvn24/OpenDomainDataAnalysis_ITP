		<content>Several of us live in houses included  
in our survey:1.My house,Northmead     
cottage,Blackpond Lane,was originally a
coachman's house built 1887.Since then 
it has been altered much and is now    
three times the size.Our garage is the 
stables and coachhouse,we believe that 
there is a ghost there!                
2."Holcombe" is my house in Crown lane 
in Farnham Royal.It was named by       
previous owners who moved from Holcombe
in Devon.It was built in 1932.We moved 
there in 4/1/1979.We have extended it  
since then.Crown Lane has four         
different aspects;1.Several detatched  
houses at the bottom.2.Kennedy's garden

Allerds House(See page 9).4.Nine
