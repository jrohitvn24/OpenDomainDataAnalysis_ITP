		<content> David Maine is a{POLICE}constable     
 responsible for{LAW AND ORDER}in most 
 of Sandown but his station is at      
 Shanklin.  The most serious case he   
 has been on was a{TRAFFIC ACCIDENT}   
 involving a girl of 13 who was killed.
 He would not deal with a murder case. 
 He deals with lesser crimes such as   
 assaults, break-ins or accidents.     
 Once a person fell from Culver Cliffs,
 but P.C. Maine was not satisfied with 
 the reasons.  He is part of the       
 Hampshire Constabulary.  There are 180
 police officers on The Island.  There 
 are more crimes during the Summer than
 the Winter because of the             
{HOLIDAYMAKERS.} He joined the force   
 when he was 16 as a cadet and had to  
 do a training course when he was 18.  
 He passed his exams.  The Island now  
 has 14 volvo cars, 2 BMW motorcycles  
 and 35 to 40 Honda motorcycles.       </content>
