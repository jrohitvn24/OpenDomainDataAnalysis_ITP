		<content>   The strong community spirit in      
 Chinnor has promoted many leisure     
 opportunities. Chinnor Players, a     
 drama group, performs in the Village  
 Hall and the Chinnor Operatic Society 
 also puts on regular productions      
 there. Chinnor Silver Band has a      
 healthy record in competitions around 
 the district, with a section for      
 younger musicians. Cubs, Scouts,      
 Guides and Brownies also cater for the
 many young children of the village.   
 Soccer is played on two playing       
 fields, one of which is also used for 
  cricket matches in the summer.       
 Regular whist drives are held and the 
 six public houses in Chinnor generate 
 activities like darts, bar billiards  
 and Aunt Sally. In Sydenham, inns     
 compete at cricket, Aunt Sally,       
 general knowledge contests etc. There 
 is a field donated for recreation.    </content>
