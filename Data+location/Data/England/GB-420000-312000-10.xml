		<content>    During the afternoon we either     
carry on with our work or we play      
sports,such as rounders and football.We
have a short playtime in the afternoon 
and sometimes we end the day by using  
the computer.                          
   At 3.30 we collect our belongings   
and go home. When I get home I put my  
things away and have my tea,which is   
something like chicken and vegetable   
pie and chips,and a drink of orange.   
   After my tea I go out to play with  
my friends, and then at 7.30 I go home,
have a bath, and eat some supper.I get 
ready for bed and then watch television
until 9 o'clock when I go to bed.      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
