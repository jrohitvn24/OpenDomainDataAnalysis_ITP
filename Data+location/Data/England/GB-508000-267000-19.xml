		<title>19Kimbolton - Recreation</title>
		<content> Two well-maintained playgrounds serve 
 the younger children.Brownies,Guides, 
 Scouts and Youth Club are available   
 for the next age-group.For adults     
 there is a wide range of              
 activities.The{Town}Football          
 and Cricket Clubs (the prefix a proud 
 relic of past status)are traditionally
 strong,and the latter draws members   
 from a wide radius.Badminton,Swimming 
 and Tennis all have a good            
 following.There are smaller,but long  
 -standing societies for amateur       
 drama,local history,bell-ringing,     
 choir,photography,rifle-shooting.     
 Women's Institute,British Legion,Darby
 and Joan meet regularly.There are     
 about 20 diligent allotment-holders.  
 Many of the over-18's who indulge in  
 these activities will subsequently    
 join those less energetically minded  
 in one of Kimbolton's 5 pubs.         </content>
