		<title>18Westcliff Estate.(Continued)</title>
		<content> The flats on this part of the estate  
 were only two storeys high and looked 
 more like the large houses across the 
 road. They were in blocks of four and 
 were not really like flats at all     
 because they were quite large.Not far 
 away from this small number of flats, 
 there were some three blocked houses. 
 These were three storeys high with a  
 garage at ground level, and the living
 quarters above. Some of the garages   
 needed repainting and windows         
 replacing, and there was also evidence
 of quite a lot of vandalism.          
 At the other end of the same road,    
 however, the dormer houses were very  
 well kept.                            
 The unusual thing about these types of
 houses is that the upstairs windows   
 stick out from the sloping roof, over 
 the lower ones, and they were large.
