 Belgrave Hall is just off Thurcaston  
 Road and was built in the reign of    
 Queen Anne. The gardens are very      
 beautiful but getting overgrown. The  
 rooms are well set out with period    
 furniture and decor.There is a grain  
 grinder which is quite dangerous as   
 when I visited my mate ripped the skin
 off his finger. Today Belgrave is a   
 busy industrial suburb but Belgrave   
 Hall remains undisturbed in peaceful  
 surroundings and is well worth a      
 visit.
