		<content>   There are five people that have a   
 farm, three have animals and crops,   
 the other two have just crops. Nobody 
 has a farm with just animals.         
                                       
   There is one fork-lift truck, two   
 combine harvesters, one caterpillar   
 tractor, two tractors, two bailers,   
 two elevators, one grass cutter and   
 one potato digger.                    
                                       
   Crops such as barley, corn, wheat   
 and oil seed rape are grown.  Some    
 fields are full of grass which are cut
 down and used to make hay. The bailer 
 is used to make hay into bails. The   
 potato digger is used to dig up       
 potatoes because the fields are so big
 that it would take a long time to pull
 up the potatoes by hand.
