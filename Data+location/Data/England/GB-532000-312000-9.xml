 THE MAIN FUEL USED IN THE AREA IS     
 SOLID FUEL - COAL AND COKE(SOME COKE  
 IS IMORTED). THE COAL OPEN FIRE IS    
 STILL POPULAR IN THE COUNTRY ALTHOUGH 
 NOT SO MUCH IN THE TOWNS AS GAS IS    
 SEEN TO BE MORE CONVENIENT AND WE HAVE
 NO GAS PIPES LAID THIS FAR OUT AS IT  
 WOULD COST TOO MUCH TO PROVIDE GAS TO 
 THIS WIDESPREAD BUT LOW POPULATED     
 AREA. SOME PEOPLE HOWEVER, RECENTLY   
 HAVE BEEN INSTALLING CALOR GAS AND    
 THIS IS ESPECIALLY POPULAR WITH THE   
 NEW PROPERTY WHICH IS BEING BUILT.    
 OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY USED OF COURSE  
 ARE ELECTRICITY AND OIL AND IT IS     
 STILL POSSIBLE TO FIND A PROPERTY IN  
 THE AREA WHERE NO ELECTRICITY HAS YET 
 BEEN CONNECTED.
