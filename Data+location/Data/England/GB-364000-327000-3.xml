 One of the most common types of farms 
 in this area is a poultry farm.       
 A typical poultry farm could have     
 84,000 hens, 28,000 to a shed.They lay
 60,000 eggs a day. The farmer may sell
 his eggs himself or have them packed  
 for a firm and sent off.              
   Two breeds of hen are used:  Ross   
 Brown and Warren.They say Warren lay  
 better than  Ross Brown  and lay      
 more.Before the hens can go into the  
 poultry farm they have to be injected 
 to stop them from getting diseases.   
  Each hen has to be done one at a time
 3 times a month.This to just over     
 3,000 hens,it is a horrible job. The  
 hens are fed on laying ration which   
 gives them the correct amount of      
 elements. Each hen spends its life    
 cooped up inside a small cage.        </content>
