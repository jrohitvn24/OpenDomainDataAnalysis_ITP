		<content> I.C.I. resulted in 1946 from plastic  
 demand,excellent site,communications, 
 coal and skills.Production of petro   
 chemicals exceeds two million tonnes  
 ,60% minimally exported mostly to     
 Europe,America and the Far East.      
 Efficiency helped weather recession   
 but the approx 6,250 work force-95%   
 male-is falling,without compulsory    
 redundancy.Skilled female employees   
 increase and skill is increasingly    
 essential,though unskilled are        
 employed I.C.I. gives to charity and  
 education and further links are sought
 Interviewees,mostly male, middle-aged,
 White collar,working 37.5 hours/week  
 seemed happy with I.C.I,which provides
 profit sharing and good facilities.   
 Pollution and other hazards are       
 controlled and neat plant is separated
 from habitation.Projection is         
 difficult because of oversea markets  </content>
