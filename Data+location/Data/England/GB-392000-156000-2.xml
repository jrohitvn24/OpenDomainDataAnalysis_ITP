		<content> The 54 houses are mostly red brick and
 line the main street. Several have    
 stone coins. The older brick came from
 Caen Hill brick works, Devizes. 4 farm
 houses remain and 4 pairs of farm     
 cottages, several others having been  
 converted to owner occupied single    
 properties.The council owns 2 pairs of
 cottages; the other houses are owner  
 occupied and mostly detached. There   
 are 6 bungalows, l timber framed Tudor
 house and 1 thatched cottage. 13 have 
 been built in the last 20 yrs, 6 are  
 being built now, with planning        
 permission granted for another 17 (14 
 of them on Campbell-Grays land - this 
 has caused some local concern). The 6 
 houses presently under construction   
 are of the 'executive' type with      
 prices ranging up to over Â£110,000.   
 The 125yr old stone church has 1 bell;
 services are held most Sundays.       </content>
