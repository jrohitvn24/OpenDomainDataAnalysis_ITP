		<title>14THE PARKWAY AND TOURISM</title>
		<content>{The Parkway}                          
 On the 1st April 1985 The Parkway was 
 opened.It is a dual carriageway road  
 and was built to link the Tamar bridge
 which links Devon and Cornwall.       
 The actual traffic jams were at Marsh 
 Mills and they solved it by building a
 Â£34,000,000 bypass.                   
                                       
{Tourism}                              
 Devon and Cornwall are popular tourist
 areas so in the summer months         
 thousands of visitors come in their   
 cars.With the new Parkway road open,  
 the traffc now moves freely avoiding  
 Plymouth centre,but a bottle neck     
 still occurs at the Tamar bridge.     
 St.Budeaux also has a railway station 
 where the line links Devon to Cornwall
 via Brunels bridge across the river   
 Tamar built 1859.
