		<content> Copthall Farm is a dairy produce      
 farm.They have {70}Fresian milking    
 cows and 80 calves .  They have 1     
 Hereford stud bull. Artificial        
 insemination is used to produce a     
 perfect Fresian breed. Some heifers   
 mate with the Hereford Bull and       
 produce meat calves. The farm does not
 slaughter the cows themselves,but sell
 them for slaughtering. The farmer owns
 100 acres of land. Most of the land is
 used for grazing or silage.1 field is 
 about 10 to 12 acres large.They do not
 grow any crops but grass.There are    
 three different methods of storing    
 grass,for cattle in winter.They are   
 pickling,drying and freezing.This     
 particular farm uses pickling.In May  
 and June,when the grass is at its peak
 ,half the grazing area is used for    
 grazing and the other half is used for
 silage.                               </content>
