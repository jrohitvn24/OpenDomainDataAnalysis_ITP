		<title>08Types of Houses in Knebworth</title>
		<content> We surveyed the houses of the children
 of Knebworth school and received 157  
 replies. We asked the question "What  
 sort of house do you live in ?" Here  
 are the results. Three of the replies 
 came from outside Knebworth so they   
 have been discounted. We found that   
 the following lived in each category: 
     Detached      {63                 
{   }Semi-detached {67                 
{   }Terraced      {11                 
{   }Bungalow       {8                 
{   }Maisonette     {4                 
     Flat           {1                 
{   }              ___                 
     Total    {    154                 
 We found that most of the families    
 that replied lived in detached and    
 semi_detached houses. There are quite 
 a few people who live in bungalows but
 they do not have children who are the 
 right age to go to primary school.    </content>
