		<title>02NABURN INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content> Naburn established as a vale farming  
 settlement and ferry port on the Ouse 
 stands at the limit of tidal naviga-  
 tion,but the economic importance of   
 river freight and cross_river works   
 has diminished and the towpaths are   
 now overgrown. The village acts as a  
 service (dormitory and sewage) and    
 recreaational(boating,yachting,Pub,   
 club,Riding School,Guest House,Caravan
 Park)adjunct to York,but fortunately  
 has been spared the explosive growth  
 of other satelite villages by building
 development restraint imposed by the  
 local landowning family at Naburn Hall
 Most house types since the early C19  
 are represented here,from original    
 estate workers cottages,Victorian farm
 houses and vicarage,mid C20 buildings 
 and council housing,to modern small   
 scale estate developments and infill  
 with detached houses and bungalows.   </content>
