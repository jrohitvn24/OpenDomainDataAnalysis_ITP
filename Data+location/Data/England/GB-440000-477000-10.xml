		<title>10Employment in rural Sowerby</title>
		<content>    There is full employment in this   
 block, as the only housing available  
 is connected with employment. All the 
 employment is associated with farming,
 with extra helpers being brought in at
 busy times, such as clearing poultry  
 houses, potato picking and grain      
 harvest. The farmers' wives too earn  
 extra pocket money on the farms at    
 these times.                          
    One or two farms in the block take 
 in "Bed and Breakfast" visitors, and  
 this too provides employment for      
 farmers' wives, as well as some       
 welcome extra income.
