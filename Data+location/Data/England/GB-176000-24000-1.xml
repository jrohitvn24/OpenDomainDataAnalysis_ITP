		<content>                                       
   This area consists of the village of
 Manaccan-mainly older cottages with a 
 church,village hall,shops,garage      
 etc.,with St.Anthony in Meneage(Monks 
 Land) situated down by the creekside  
 and Helford Village. There is a very  
 pretty church, boatyard, homes and    
 holiday cottages nestling in the      
 trees.                                
 There are several houses at Gillan and
 Flushing, some fairly modern, with    
 their own local shop.                 
 There are woods, Carne Creek and the  
 Durra River which once supported five 
 mills but sadly none are now working. 
 It is mainly an agricultural area with
 several retirement homes.             
 There is an abundance of wildlife and 
 birds which make it a very attractive 
 place in which to live.
