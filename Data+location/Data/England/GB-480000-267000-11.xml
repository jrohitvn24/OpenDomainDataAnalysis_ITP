		<title>11SS. Peter and Paul, Sywell.</title>
		<content>The Parish Church of SS. Peter and Paul
is the only place of worship in Sywell.
It is a Church of England Church and   
belongs to the Diocese of Peterborough.
It is situated in the old village and  
is bordered on one side by the village 
green and the old school, and on the   
other sides by farmland. It is built   
of local sandstone and is very         
picturesque. There are weekly Holy     
Communion services and Evensong on     
alternate Sundays. Holy Baptism and    
other Sacraments are arranged          
separately with the Rector.            
At Harvest time the Primary School     
traditionally take part in the         
Communion Service. Each Friday, during 
Lent, the Primary School also take a   
service. There are more funeral        
services than weddings. Sywell, meaning
seven wells, was mentioned in the      
original Domesday Book.                </content>
