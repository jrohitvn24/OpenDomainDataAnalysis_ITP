		<content>      The landscape is of gently       
 rolling fields divided into small farm
 units. Some of these have been        
 combined to form larger units and     
 their redundant farmhouses and barns  
 and buildings converted into holiday  
 accommodation for the tourist trade.  
 The economy of the whole area is      
 dominated by farming and tourism. The 
 village of Lansallos has been         
 overshadowed by the growth and        
 popularity of nearby Polperro-to the  
 East-which has become almost a Mecca  
 for tourists visiting the West        
 Country. This provides good employment
 during the summer season.
