		<title>03ST.JOHN'S CHURCH, BROMSGROVE</title>
		<content>   {St.John's Church}was built between 
 the 12th and 15th centuries. It is a  
 fine sandstone church with a west     
 tower and a beautiful{spire}built in  
 the 14th century. In the spire are ten
 bells which date from 1701 to 1816.The
 church was restored by Sir Gilbert    
 Scott in 1858.                        
    It is sited on a hill looking down 
 on the town. It has got a gate called 
 the{Lychgate}with 42 steps leading up 
 to it. In the graveyard there are some
 very famous tombstones. There are two 
 about a train accident in 1840. The   
 engine was going up the Lickey incline
 and the force was too much for the    
 boiler and it exploded, killing the   
 two engine drivers.
