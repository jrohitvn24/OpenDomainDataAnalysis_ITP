		<title>12Milnsbridge Shopping Centre.</title>
		<content>    Milnsbridge has a small shopping   
 centre.The roads are hard to cross    
 because of the traffic. There are     
 plenty of food shops and some people  
 do weekly shopping at "Kwik Save"     
 superstore.If you need money there are
 3 banks and 2 building societies. For 
 a good choice of clothing you will    
 have to go to town. The sweet shop    
 opens at 08.00 till 17.30 on weekdays 
 and 08.00 till 14.00 on Saturdays.    
 It's mostly children who buy sweets.  
 Among the favourites are Mars Bars    
 and Kit Kats and a variety of boiled  
 sweets.The shop sells greeting cards  
 too. Young people prefer humorous     
 cards.                                
    Close to the viaduct is a workshop 
 in a mill. Here old pine furniture is 
 stripped of paint, smoothed and waxed,
 and then the furniture is sold.
