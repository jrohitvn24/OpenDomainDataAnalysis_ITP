		<content> The survey of this area was done by   
 the headmaster and junior pupils of   
{Broadhempston Primary School.}As this 
 is a small village school all twelve  
 juniors were involved although none   
 live in the survey area.This meant a  
 lot of travelling and we thank parents
 who helped with transport and the many
 inhabitants who made us welcome,      
 showed us around, answered questions  
 and even provided refreshment! The    
 school is not in the survey area so   
 the two pages about Broadhempston were
 done by us instead of Ipplepen School 
 in whose area it comes.{List of
