		<title>06TROON Crnwll- Entertainment</title>
		<content> TROON is a fairly active village in   
 providing its own day time            
 entertainment, for example the Womens 
 Institute meets reguarly and is well  
 attended.  However TROON does lack    
 evening entertainment especially for  
 the young.  It has a very strong Old  
 Folks Club as a large proportion of   
 the population are retired.  For the  
 younger generation there are active   
 youth groups and a Toc H group for    
 both girls and boys.                  
 TROON holds various annual events such
 as a carnival, sports days, horse show
 and gymkhana.  In the village hall    
 they hold an annual pantomime, but    
 most of the time it is used for bingo.
 TROON also holds various handicraft   
 shows and floral art displays.  The   
 TROON Singers, which are mainly from  
 the Chapel Choir, give concerts       
 throughout the year.                  </content>
