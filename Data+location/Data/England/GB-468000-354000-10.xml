		<title>10OLD MILLS IN SOUTHWELL</title>
		<content>  Possiby the first mention of{mills   
 in Southwell is in the{Domesday Book  
 in 1086."There are two mills rendering
 four shillings and a fish pond".These 
 would have belonged to the Lord of the
 Manor,who was the{Archbishop of York. 
 He would have employed millers and    
 taken the profits.We do not know      
 exactly where these mills were on the 
{River Greet,}but it is highly likely  
 that the more modern mills are on     
 their sites.                          
   Mills are to be found at            
 Maythorne,Station Road and at the     
 bottom of Mill Lane in{Upton.}Before  
 Steam power came,in the eighteenth    
 century water_power was very important
 (being more reliable than wind) and   
 this is why there are so many mills   
 here .These mills did not suffer from 
 shortage of water in summer because   
 they had ponds.                       </content>
