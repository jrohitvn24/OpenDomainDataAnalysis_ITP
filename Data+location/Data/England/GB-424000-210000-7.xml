		<title>07Burford Transport &amp; Traffic</title>
		<content>Burford relies to an enormous extent on
private cars.Most families make use of 
their own cars often. Almost half the  
people go to work by car or by motor   
cycle. Few go by cycle or by bus. Many 
car owners shop outside Burford and go 
elsewhere for recreation.The busy A361 
Road brings heavy traffic to Burford   
High Street,particularly lorry traffic.
Most people are in favour of rerouting 
this via a by-pass.Local tradespeople  
oppose this because they fear loss of  
business.Some residents and visitors   
feel that the parking facilities are   
not adequately used.They suggest that  
the provision of a by-pass backed up   
with improved parking facilities would 
relieve the town of its present        
overloaded traffic conditions.
