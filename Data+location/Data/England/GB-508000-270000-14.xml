		<title>14HEALTH CARE IN WEST CAMBS.</title>
		<content>    There are no medical facilities in 
 the area, and most residents attend   
 the doctors' surgery at Kimbolton for 
 routine treatment. When necessary, the
 doctors visit patients in their own   
 homes, and the services of a community
 nurse are also available.  Dental care
 is obtained at nearby towns, usually  
 Huntingdon or St. Neots.              
                                       
    The nearest hospital is also at    
 Huntingdon, but patients are sometimes
 referred to hospitals at Cambridge or 
 Bedford. A hospital car service can be
 arranged for those without private    
 transport.                            
                                       
    Special transport is also provided 
 to take mentally and physically       
 handicapped children and adults and   
 elderly, housebound patients to day   
 centres in the towns.                 </content>
