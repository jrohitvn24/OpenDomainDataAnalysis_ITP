 In my dads spare time he either       
 watches television if there is        
 anything on or he goes across to      
 Hollycroft Park and plays golf or     
 tennis or he goes swimming and jumps  
 off all the diving boards or he plays 
 in the garden with me, Richard and    
 Hazel in our garden I swing           
 and then he goes and has his tea.Then 
 we watch the television.              
                                       
 In my mums spare time she either      
 watches television if there is        
 anything on, or goes outside and plays
 chinese elastic. Then we go up to the 
 town and we have some fish and chips  
 at Topper's fish bar,or we go into a  
 restaurant,then we go home.
