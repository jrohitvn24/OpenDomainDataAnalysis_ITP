		<content> Sheep run with cattle &amp; give 1.5 -2   
 lambs a head each year.  A large pig  
 rearing enterprise is sited on the    
 disused railway.  Turkeys are produced
 for the Christmas Trade.              
 Although sprays against pests &amp; dis-  
 eases are used widely, together with  
 fertilizers &amp; much ploughing done     
 there remain 2 ridge &amp; furrow fields. 
 Post &amp; rail fences or hedges mark the 
 field boundaries &amp; old mixed coverts  
 house a variety of wild-life. One new 
 plantation is hoped to replace elms   
 destroyed by the recent outbreak of   
 Dutch Elm Disease.                    
 Hens &amp; ducks provide eggs &amp; poultry   
 for the farm kitchen.  Dogs are worked
 &amp; cats keep down the mice &amp; rats.  The
 traditional farm life continues but   
 using mechanical &amp; computer knowledge 
 to improve production.
