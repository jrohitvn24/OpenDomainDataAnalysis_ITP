		<content>      In our village most of the men   
 work in mines.                        
      Policemen are very brave and     
 catch criminals and find things for   
 people. Milkmen have to get up at     
 about 5 o'clock in the morning. At our
 school the postman comes before we are
 up. He has a hard job remembering     
 where the different streets are.      
 Dustmen have a very dirty job to do.  
 Some of the things that are thrown    
 away are cleaned and used again.      
      A lot of men in Forest Town work 
 in mines. There are three shifts. My  
 dad is a deputy. When you want to be a
 deputy you have to go on a training   
 course and learn about First Aid. You 
 have to do a lot of work. Men who work
 in pits dig out coal. Some men get    
 killed and some men get buried in     
 coal.
