 annual carnival.It takes place on the 
 Upper Hale Road and finishes at Hale  
 Rec.There are lots of floats in it and
 also lots of people walking along.    
  They all dress up and sometimes give 
 out sweets,ballons and paper          
 hats.There are lots of different ideas
 for dressing up such as clowns,pirates
 and sportsmen.                        
  The carnival starts at 7.30.After the
 carnival there is a fair and some     
 stalls.There are                      
 dodgems,candyfloss,hotdogs,tombola,   
 football,waltzer and haunted mill.    
  At about 10.30 they had fire works.  
 They spend a few hundred pounds on    
 them.                                 
 The fireworks last about 15 minutes.
