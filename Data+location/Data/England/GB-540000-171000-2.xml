		<title>02MOTTINGHAM VILLAGE TO SUBURB</title>
		<content>                                       
   Our grid reference has the village  
of Mottingham at the centre,bordered   
by  Eltham in the North,Chislehurst in 
the East and Grove Park to the South   
West.The local government is quite     
complicated as some of the shops and   
houses pay half of their rates to      
Bromley and half to Greenwich, as the  
border runs through them.Mottingham is 
not mentioned in the Domesday Book but 
it is referred to in 862 AD in the     
Charter of King Elthelbert.In those    
days it was called Modingham.It started
life as a village surrouned by farms.In
1866 the coming of the railway meant   
that the population grew.Later the     
population was increased by the        
building of a council estate for 12,000
people.Since then many new homes have  
been built.The population continues to 
grow.                                  </content>
