		<title>15Law and Order in Eversley</title>
		<content>   {P.C. Moore}has been in Eversley for
 four years. He is our local policeman 
 and he told us about his job. As      
 Eversley is a rural area there is a   
 low level of crime. He receives about 
 six or ten telephone calls a day which
 involve traffic accidents,thefts,     
 burglaries, assaults, criminal damage,
 missing people, stray animals,        
 domestic disputes, deaths and         
 indecency offences. P.C. Moore begins 
 his day by calling to see if any      
 crimes or statements have been        
 reported at the office. He has to deal
 with between fifteen and twenty       
 burglaries a year.                    
    His main police station is         
 Farnborough. He uses a motor-bicycle  
 most of the time but sometimes he uses
 a car. This year he has been to       
 Nottingham to the miners' strike      
 picket lines.                         </content>
