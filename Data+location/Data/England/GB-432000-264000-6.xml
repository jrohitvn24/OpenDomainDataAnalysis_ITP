		<title>06THE POUND COIN.</title>
		<content>   We asked people in Leamington what  
 they thought about the new pound coin 
 introduced in January 1985 to replace 
 the one pound note. There had been    
 many complaints in the press, but in  
 the survey we found that 28 out of    
 54 people said they liked it, 18 did  
 not like it and 8 were non-commital.  
   From what the newspapers had said,  
 we expected to find a huge majority of
 people opposed to the new coin but in 
 fact we found that over 50% of those  
 we asked were quite happy with it. On 
 the other hand, when asked if they    
 thought a plastic note would have been
 better than a coin, 29 said yes.      
   Most people seem to accept the need 
 to replace the paper note, but not    
 everyone thinks the coin is the best  
 replacement.
