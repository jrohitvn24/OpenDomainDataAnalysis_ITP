		<title>10Swainsthorpe Vale Hospital</title>
		<content> The Vale Hospital was built as a Union
 worskhouse for the Humbleyard Church  
 Hundred in 1835 at a cost of Â£6200. It
 was enlarged in 1858 having           
 accommodation for 250 inmates. In     
 continuous use ever since, it         
 developed into a geriatric hospital in
 the 1930's and remained in use until  
 September 1984 when it closed for     
 economic reasons.                     
 A large three storeyed Norfolk bricked
 slate roofed building lying in a      
 valley along a back road, it is a     
 dominant feature of the area. On the  
 ground floor are a kitchen, 3 wards   
 each of which held 30 people, and an  
 occupational therapy room. First floor
 had another 3 wards. Second floor had 
 a laundry, meeting room, and          
 staffroom. There were 100 staff       
 including matron, nurses, cooks,      
 cleaners, supervidors and office staff</content>
