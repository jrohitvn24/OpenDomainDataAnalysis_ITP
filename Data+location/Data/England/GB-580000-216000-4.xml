		<title>04Transport around Rivenhall</title>
		<content>   Vehicles using roads in Britain are 
 of mainly six types,these being cars, 
 vans, lorries, motorcycles, buses and 
 bicycles.The roads in the area around 
 Rivenhall range from very small minor 
 roads,which have very little traffic  
 on them,up to a major road,the A12.We 
 have no motorways in this area.A      
 survey of vehicles using a local      
 B-road and the A12 showed that during 
 a working day an average of 160       
 vehicles used the B-road and 1280     
 vehicles used the A12.                
   A mainline railway passes through   
 this area going from London to Norwich
 or Clacton.There is also a branch line
 from Witham to Braintree.The trains   
 are both diesel and electric and carry
 both passengers and goods.During a    
 working day in excess of two hundred  
 trains travel along the main railway  
 line.                                 </content>
