		<title>11The Workhouse at Chobham</title>
		<content> When{people}were too{poor}to pay the  
 rent, they were sent to the{workhouse 
 to live. They were made to work and   
 sometimes{children}were sold. It was a
 great disgrace to be sent to the      
 workhouse but apart from that{married 
{couples}were separated. Chobham's work
 house was at{Burrow Hill.}If any      
 relatives claimed you, which was most 
 unlikely, they could bail you out. The
 workhouse was so revolting that people
 put away money in their wills for     
 their{servants}so they could be looked
 after. One workhouse was called       
 Jubilee Cottages at Red Lion Road. It 
 burnt down two years later. In 1790 it
 was rebuilt on waste land. In 1920 the
 first{council houses}were built. The  
 workhouse was converted into three    
 cottages.{Orphans}were handed over to 
 people as servants until about the    
 1930's.                               </content>
