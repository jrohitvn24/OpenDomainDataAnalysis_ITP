		<title>17DARRINGTON QUARRIES</title>
		<content> Darrington Quarries have been working 
 at the Cridling Stubbs site since     
 1942.They have 7 other quarries which 
 are part of the same group.10 people  
 are employed extracting the stone at  
 the Cridling Stubbs quarry.           
 Limestone is taken in different grades
 and sizes,the most common being 1\inch
 diameter or smaller.{1000 tons of     
{limestone leave the quarry each day.  
 This is from a 9 hour working day.The 
 quarry is open 5\ days a week.        
 Main uses of the stone are for        
 concrete products,ready mixed         
 concrete,motorway bases and drainage  
 media.Regular local buyers are        
 Plasmor,Readimix and Tilcon.          
 As the lorries leave the quarry they  
 are weighed and washed.Even so the    
 roads leading to the quarry are often 
 white with limestone dust.
