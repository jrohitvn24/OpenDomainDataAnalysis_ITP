		<title>17Hall and Church, Great Alne</title>
		<content>      The Great Alne Village Hall was  
 built in the early 1920's as a        
 memorial for the Great War. It has    
 been used for a variety of activities 
 such as rifle practice for the Home   
 Guard, dances, drama group, a library 
 and auctions. Every year a Christmas  
 party and a big summer event are held.
 Regular activities include a dog club,
 W.I., Senior Citizens, Brownies, Cubs 
 and Scouts. The flag pole commemorates
 the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. 
      Great Alne church is linked with 
 Kinwarton and Haselor churches and    
 shares the Rector. Attached to the    
 church is a club for teenagers, a     
 Mother's Union and a Discussion Group.
 There is a rota arranged for Church   
 cleaning, putting flowers in the      
 church and tidying the church yard.   
 Few children under 11 live in the     
 village, so there is no Sunday School.</content>
