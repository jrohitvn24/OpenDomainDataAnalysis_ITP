		<content> Visit to Stud Farmhouse,Blaisdon.     
 Mr. and Mrs Richard Hawker were       
 interviewed on their{Stud Farmhouse   
 which contains 73 hectares. Their main
 business is now a{dairy herd}and not a
 Stud Farm. They own 1{Hereford Cross  
{Bull and 120 cows} which they milk    
 through Modern milking Parlours with  
 computerised feeding. The cows are    
{British Fresian and British Holstein  
 which are bred on the farm. Each cow  
 produces{5,800 litres of milk}per year
 which is collected every day by       
 tanker. From{1901-1924}the Stud Farm  
 was famous for rearing{Shire horses.  
 The farm employs a cowman and a       
 student. The farm itself grows no     
 crops except sillage (rotted grass)   
 which is the main bulk food for the   
 milking herd. Machinery wise they own 
 3 tractors and grass harvesting       
 equipment.                            </content>
