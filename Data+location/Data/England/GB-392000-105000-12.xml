		<content> THE 3 ACRE GARDEN LEADS D0WN T0 THE   
 RIVER.IN THE GR0UNDS ARE THE MILL &amp;   
 THE MILL H0USE - BUILT AR0UND 1840 -  
 1850.THE MILL IS UNALTERED &amp; IS IN    
 G00D  C0NDITI0N. THE MILLER'S HOUSE   
 ADJOINS THE MILL.THE HOUSE ROOF HAS   
 BEEN LIFTED TO SQUARE OFF THE UPPER   
 STOREY.                               
 COL. BLOUNT WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SHOW US
 OVER THE MILL-HOUSE. HE ALSO GAVE US A
 VERY DETAILED HISTORY OF TARRANT      
 RUSHTON HOUSE.                        
 THE VILLAGE IS NOT ON A MAIN THOROUGH 
 - FARE AND THIS HAS MEANT THAT IT     
 IS  UNAFFECTED BY SURBURBAN LIVING.   
 THE NARROW LANE IS EDGED WITH COW     
 PARSLEY. COTTAGE GARDENS FLOURISH;    
 SOME WITH CULTIVATED FLOWERS. A FEW   
 FULL OF WILD? FLOWERS. THE EFFECT IS  
 OF PEACEFUL HARMONY, WHERE BIRDS &amp;    
 INSECTS ARE ALLOWED TO THRIVE.
