		<content>{The First and Last Inn}is very famous 
 It is said to be about 700 years old. 
 It is unique in that both sides of its
 swinging Inn sign are different. On   
 one side{The First Inn}and on the     
 other side{The Last Inn}in{England.   
 Now the manager of{The First and Last 
 is{Derek Angove. The First and Last}  
 was first built to house the monks    
 who built{St.Senan Church.}It became  
 an Inn about 300 years ago. Smugglers 
 and wreckers used it often for hiding 
 stolen goods. One of the tunnels went 
 across the road to the{manor house.}It
 was used for listening to the farmers 
 conversations about prices at the     
 market so that the owner could cheat  
 them out of their money. (At the      
 moment the tunnels are sealed off).   
 There are other tunnels leading to the
 cliffs.{The First and Last}is very    
 popular and worth a visit.            </content>
