		<title>09WILCOX AND SONS 4</title>
		<content> Mr Wilcox has a very active mind.     
 When he saw that making saw-mill      
 equipment might be a small market, he 
 invested in the machinery to increase 
 the range of his products.   Because  
 one of his sons was involved in       
{scrambling,}he decided to prove that  
 he could make an{English bike}that    
 was as good as the Japanese make.     
 They designed and built one that was  
 so good that no one who bought one has
 yet brought it back for repairs or    
 improvement.   He could not sell the  
 bikes, though, as his{bank would not  
{spend enough money on advertising     
 them.   He says he will make a better 
 one one day.   He showed us the few   
 bikes he has got left, locked in a    
 shed.   They are{fantastic.  }He is   
 also planning on starting a{timber    
{yard,}as he has the space and the     
 equipment.  He is a{remarkable man.   </content>
