		<content> MR ALAN ANDREW                        
 Mr Andrew lives in Bury Road. He      
 works for a printing firm, but his    
 hobby is painting.He is a very good   
 artist and I like his work very much. 
        He doesn't do portraits. His   
 pictures are of the countryside,      
 villages, and old buildings  such as  
 Edington church. We also have a       
 painting of his of our school hanging 
 in the school cloakroom.              
                      Mr Andrew said   
 firstly a painting needs to be drawn  
 well. He uses water colours mostly.   
 Much of his work goes on exhibition,  
 where he sells.                       
        He started when he was about   
 sixteen. He is  the only artist in his
 family ,and he would very much        
 like to earn his living from painting 
 and drawing.
