		<title>18Entertainment in Silverdale</title>
		<content>Once Silverdale had a cinema,a dance   
hall and four bowling greens.There were
also many pubs.Now people mostly go to 
Newcastle-Under-Lyme or Hanley to seek 
entertainment.The local working mensÂ£  
clubs are very popular with special    
evenings and organised outings.The     
local churches and chapels have many   
special interest groups that adults can
enjoy in their spare time.             
Children in Silverdale might amuse them
-selves by joining a Youth Club or the 
local branch of the Scouts or Guides.We
can all enjoy a game of tennis,putting 
or bowls in the local park,and there is
a swings and play area for the smaller 
children.During the Summer holiday the 
Police Force have organised a special  
events scheme called S.P.A.C.E.in which
there are lots of fun and sports to    
keep the children busy.There are many  
competitions and visits to enjoy.      </content>
