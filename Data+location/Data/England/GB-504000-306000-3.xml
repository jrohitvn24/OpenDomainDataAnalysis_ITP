		<title>03A Farmers Day.</title>
		<content> I got up at 6:50 and went downstairs  
 to get a cup of tea for me and my     
 wife. Then I put a straw bale on the  
 central heating boiler. I went across 
 the yard to feed the pigs and clean   
 them out. Then I went home for        
 breakfast of egg, bacon and fried     
 bread. I drove the tractor and sprayer
 around the field to spray the crops   
 with weed-killer. Then I had my dinner
 - meat and vegatables, apple pie and  
 custard.                              
 After this I cleaned out the sprayer  
 before putting some fertilizer on the 
 field of beans. I had to go back after
 my tea of sandwiches and cake to      
 finish the field. I got back into the 
 yard at 23:00, then went to bed, ready
 for another day.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
