		<title>02Housing in Halewood.</title>
		<content>     The housing in Halewood is quite  
 varied, but is mainly in two separate 
 areas. The dividing line between these
 areas is the railway line between     
 Liverpool and Manchester.             
     North of the railway is mainly the
 older part of the town. This consists 
 of the "village"  and quite a lot of  
 private housing. Most of the houses   
 are either detached or semi-detached. 
 There is a new development of private 
 housing to the north west of the      
 village.                              
     To the south of the railway is all
 council property, except for isolated 
 examples and private housing along the
 main roads.The council housing is in  
 the form of semi-detached houses,     
 flats and maisonettes. There are three
 tower blocks of flats.
