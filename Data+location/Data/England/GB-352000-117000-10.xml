		<title>10CHANNINGS OF YEOVIL</title>
		<content>{ CHANNINGS}is a family business and   
 has been since 1939.The shop sells    
 bicycles,nursery goods and toys,and a 
 quarter of the goods are British made.
  Recently trade has declined and      
 Mr.Channing has let half of his double
 shop to an 'Interiors' firm.The shop  
 is in a good position in one of the   
 main streets,with nearby parking      
 facilities but Mr.Channing fears the  
 influence of the new Quedam shopping  
 centre on his business.He sees little 
 future for shops like his as          
 Supermarkets are able to buy in large 
 quantities and sell at cheap prices.  
 Business is always good at CHristmas  
 but the rest of the time it is getting
 worse each year.
