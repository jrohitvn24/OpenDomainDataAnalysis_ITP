		<title>10KIRKELLA COUNTRYSIDE</title>
		<content> To the west and north of Kirkella     
 there is open countryside for several 
 miles.The main land cover is cereal   
 crops(especially barley) closely      
 followed by fields for grazing animals
 .There were several sizeable clumps of
 mixed woodland,but no commercial      
 plantion.Occupying a large chunk in   
 the centre of our area was Hull Golf  
 club centering Kirkella.The farms are 
 the main source of employment in the  
 area (apart from  one chalk quarry) . 
 The farmers in the main have retained 
 the traditional small field surrounded
 by hedgerows.Most farms are mixed     
 farms,growing cereal crops and keeping
 animals chiefly cows or pigs.A few    
 farms went in for some market         
 gardening growing lettuce,tomatoes or 
 strawberries and raspberries.         
 The only 'wild'land was along the old 
 disused Hull to Barnsley railway.     </content>
