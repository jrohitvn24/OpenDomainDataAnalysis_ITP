		<content>  Adisham Parish Church has no resident
Rector now but shares one with two     
other parishes. One service is held    
each Sunday, with a choir of about ten 
children and adults, with flowers by   
volunteers. The congregation is small, 
under fifty, in comparison with the    
population of about eight hundred, but 
rises at special services. There are   
fears that the quota fixed for the     
Church is too high and insolvency may  
eventually cause its closure.  There   
is a hundred year old Baptist Chapel   
with burial ground. The non-resident   
Pastor serves six parishes visiting    
frequently. The small congregation     
hold weekly services if he is not      
available. The Chapel has a strong     
Sunday School attended by children of  
all denominations.  A combined service 
with Church and Chapel is held every   
fifth week in the village.             </content>
