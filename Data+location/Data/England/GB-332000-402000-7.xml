		<title>07INCE BENET-INCE BLUNDELL</title>
		<content>   Ince benet is situated in the old   
 kitchen garden of Ince Blundell Hall. 
 Three monks began the project in an   
 attempt to create a simple life of    
 work and prayer.                      
   The building itself is an unusual   
 design, built mainly from materials   
 left over from other buiding projects 
 and other donations.                  
   Only one priest,Father Tom, now     
 remains. He is responsible for most of
 the building work. He is joined from  
 time to time by other individuals and 
 groups looking for a quiet time of    
 contemplation and prayer.             
   Ince Benet is largely               
 self-sufficient. Father Tom is an     
 expert bookbinder and earns enough for
 daily needs. He grow most of his own  
 fruit and vegetables.
