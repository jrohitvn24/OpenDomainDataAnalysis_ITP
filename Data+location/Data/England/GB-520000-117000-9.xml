		<content>   Fox hunting is the only organised   
 hunting and the area is known as the  
 "Wednesday Country" of the Southdown  
 and Eridge Foxhounds.                 
   Cub hunting begins in mid September 
 when the informal meets start at about
 7am as the scent disappears with the  
 midday sun. The first real hunt takes 
 place on the second Wednesday of      
 November each year.                   
   There are four acting Joint Masters 
 and the pack of hounds usually        
 consists of about "8 couples". The    
 number of Horse followers can vary    
 from 20 up to 50. Meets take place    
 either in the car park of a local Inn 
 or by invitation at a private country 
 house where a stirrup cup is drunk.   
   There is also an organised Foot     
 Followers Club which runs fund raising
 events to support the hunt.
