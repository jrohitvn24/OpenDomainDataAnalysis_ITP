		<content> THE FOLLOWING CHART IS THE RESULT OF A
 SURVEY OF ABOUT 100 FIRST YEAR PUPILS.
 WE WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW OFTEN THEY  
 WATCHED DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMMES.
                                       
              OFTEN. SOMETIMES. RARELY.
 CARTOONS        40      30       5

 WE ALSO FOUND THAT MOST PUPILS HAD    
 MORE THAN ONE T.V.IN THEIR HOMES,SOME 
 SAID THEY HAD 4.MORE THAN HALF WERE   
 RENTED AND ALSO COLOUR.RATHER LESS HAD
 REMOTE CONTROLLERS AND PORTABLE MODELS
 BUT OVER 75% HAD VIDEO RECORDERS ,MOST
 OF THESE WERE ALSO RENTED.            </content>
