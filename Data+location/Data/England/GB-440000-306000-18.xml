		<content>    The story goes that an elderly     
 lady, travelled regularly along an old
 cart road behind the Manor House which
 still stands in Church Road. One night
 the horse and cart wandered into a    
 muddy hole and stuck fast. She was not
 willing to leave the horse and in the 
 struggle to free it she lost her life.
                                       
                                       
    The{Manor House}is said to have its
 own ghost. The Lord of the Manor is   
 reputed to have fathered one of his   
 woman servant's children. This birth  
 out of wedlock meant that the mother  
 Betty Baker could not be buried in the
 church yard when she eventually died. 
 She was buried at the rear of the     
 Manor House and it is said that some  
 nights Betty Baker still walks inside 
 the Manor. Who knows !
