		<title>07GAYTON'S BAKERY</title>
		<content> The bakery in Maypole Lane was founded
 in 1921 by two brothers,Bill and      
 Thomas Gayton.It employs 13 people and
  takes on 2 extra schoolgirls on      
 Saturday.It bakes every day and uses 5
 tons of flour a week making bread,    
 rolls,buns,cakes and wedding cakes.   
 Until 1960 the bakery traded only in  
 Baddesley and Grendon.Now it has a    
 wholesale trade delivery to other     
 villages including shops in Atherstone
 Wilnecote,Dosthill,Woodend, Hurley,   
 Baxterley and Birchley Heath.It still 
 maintains a retail trade delivering   
 bread by van to houses in Baddesley   
 and Grendon.The price of a standard   
 loaf of bread from the van is 48p. The
 majority of the flour used is milled  
 at Tewksbury.In all the years of its  
 existence the bakery has never failed 
 to deliver the bread in the village.
