		<title>16UNHILL WOOD, OXFORDSHIRE.</title>
		<content>      Unhill Wood, which lies in the   
 north western corner of our D-block is
{Ancient Woodland.} This means that    
 there has been a wood here for many   
 hundreds of years (since before       
 detailed maps were produced).  Ancient
 woods usually contain{many tree       
{species,}and{some rare plants}such as 
 Herb Paris, which flowers only when   
 the ground has been undisturbed for a 
 very long time.  Just inside the edge 
 of Unhill Wood is a{low bank}which was
 probably the{original boundary}of the 
 wood.  This is another indication that
 the wood is old.                      
                                       
      Today Unhill Wood is quiet and   
 peaceful.  Game birds nest here in    
 Spring.  There are deer and badgers   
 and many wild birds.  Chalk downland  
 flowers grow on grass verges at the   
 edge of the wood.                     </content>
