		<title>15THE HAILSHAM MUSEUM</title>
		<content>{  The museum was built in the late    
{19th century, and was originally a    
{private home.It was not used as a     
{museum until 1960.                    
                                       
   The museum is a very small one. The 
 oldest relic is a{pre-cambrian fossil 
 about 450 million years old. In an old
 cauldron there were some{Stone Age    
 flint tools, such as axe heads,       
 scrapers and hammer stones. The latest
 aquisition is an old wooden till that 
 still works. You press any button and 
 the drawer opens. They have got an old
 selection of weaponry and ammunition. 
 There is a horse pistol used about    
 1790 , a bayonet used during World War
 I and two different sized cannon      
 balls. The artefacts are donated to   
 the museum by the finder. The Historic
 Society decide whether it is geniune.
