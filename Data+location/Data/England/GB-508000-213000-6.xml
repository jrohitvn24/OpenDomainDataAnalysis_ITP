		<content> 2 {LIVESTOCK FARMING}_ most farms in  
 the area use some of their land for   
 livestock, either as an intensive     
 enterprise making use of farm         
 buildings _ pigs especially being kept
 for farrowing and then fattened for   
 bacon, or on land not suitable for    
 cereals _ in the bottom of the valley,
 or on a few fields to provide a break 
 from cereals.                         
     The number of livestock have      
 decreased since they require too much 
 labour and most farmers have gradually
 converted their farms almost totally  
 to cereals.                           
     Dairy and beef cattle are kept.   
 The dairy herds are quite small and   
 this type of enterprise would appear  
 to be in decline.  The beef cattle are
 bought at 12_18 months and fattened   
 for 6 months using silage and barley  
 grown on the farm.                    </content>
