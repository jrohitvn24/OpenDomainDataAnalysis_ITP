		<content>       Liphook is a large village      
 situated north east of Petersfield.   
 The A3 London-Portsmouth main road    
 runs through it.  The                 
 Waterloo-Portsmouth railway line also 
 runs through Liphook.                 
                                       
       Historically, Liphood is famous 
 for the Royal Anchor Hotel.  The      
 Ancher is a famous late 17th century  
 posting inn.  Many well-known people  
 have stayed there, including Queen    
 Victoria, General Blucher and Nelson  
                                       
       In the modern day, Liphook      
 is known as being next to Longmoor    
 Camp; a military training camp.  Early
 in 1985 a cruise missile was          
 transported to Longmoor camp and peace
 protestors demonstrated outside.
