 THE WESTERN PART OF THE BLOCK IS A    
 SUBURB OF CHELTENHAM, SURROUNDING WHAT
 WAS FORMERLY THE OLD VILLAGE OF       
 CHARLTON KINGS. THE OLD HOUSING IS NOW
 OUTNUMBERED BY A LOT OF POST-WAR      
 DEVELOPMENT, BUT IS STILL EVIDENT BY  
 THE PARISH CHURCH AND AT RYEWORTH.THE 
 OLD VILLAGE CENTRE NOW HAS A MODERN   
 LIBRARY,SUPERMARKET AND PEDESTRIAN    
 SHOPPING PRECINCT. EAST OF THE TOWN   
 ,THE COTSWOLD ESCARPMENT IS BROKEN BY 
 THE A40 TRUNK ROAD WHICH RUNS         
 EASTWARDS THROUGH FIELDS AND ISOLATED 
 FARMS.THE POPULATION IS A MIX OF      
 SOCIAL LEVELS AND OCCUPATIONS,BOTH    
 RURAL AND INDUSTRIAL. THE AREA IS     
 CONSIDERED TO BE A DESIRABLE,         
 RESIDENTIAL PART OF CHELTENHAM.       
 INFLATED HOUSE PRICES REFLECT THIS.
