		<title>14FOREST OF DEAN SPEECH HOUSE</title>
		<content> THE SPEECH HOUSE WAS BUILT AS A LODGE 
 IN 1670 AND IT WAS HERE THAT THE      
 VERDERERS COURT WAS HELD.             
                                       
 IT IS NOW A T.H.F. HOTEL RENTED FROM  
 THE CROWN. IT HAS 13 ROOMS TO LET,    
 COSTING FROM Â£37 TO Â£43 PER NIGHT FOR 
 A DOUBLE ROOM.  A CHILD SLEEPING IN   
 THE SAME ROOM WOULD NOT PAY.  PETS ARE
 ALLOWED IN THE ROOMS.  MANY ROOMS ARE 
 NAMED AFTER TREES.  IN OAK ROOM THERE 
 IS A T.V., CHAIRS, BASIN, TEA &amp; COFFEE
 MAKING EQUIPMENT AND A HUGE FOUR      
 POSTER BED THAT 5 PEOPLE COULD GET    
 INTO, ALSO A GARDEN VIEW.             
                                       
 THERE IS A GHOST IN NUMBER 15. ONLY   
 VISITORS SEE HIM. HE WAKES THE VISITOR
 JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT, SMOKES A PIPE &amp; 
 THEN DISAPPEARS.                      
                                       
                                       </content>
