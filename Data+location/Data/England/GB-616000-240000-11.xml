		<title>11ORWELL BRIDGE IPSWICH</title>
		<content>This was completed in December 1982 and
took a total of four years to build. It
is a great feat of engineering, a high 
very broad concrete structure built    
across a tidal, mud-lined estuary.     
  It was built to form part of the     
Ipswich Eastern by-pass.An attempt to  
keep the heavy container lorry traffic 
bound for Felixstowe, out of the       
historic centre of Ipswich.As well as  
the difficulties of crossing such a    
broad estuary,(the bridge is 1.4 Km    
long), another problem was to build a  
high enough bridge to allow ocean-going
ships up to the port of Ipswich.The    
center arch is over 60 metres high,    
today the bridge gives one of the best 
panorama's of southern Ipswich.        
  The bridge was constructed by a team 
of experts from Holland.
