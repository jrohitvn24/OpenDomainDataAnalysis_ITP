 Baptist. The oldest part of the church
 is the tower which is 800 years old.  
 There are eight bells.Which are       
 regularly rung.The clock on the church
 has to be wound up two times a week.  
 Along the south side towards the east 
 there is a small doorway which enters 
 into the Berners chapel.This was built
 in the 16th century.                  
    There is a porch on the south with 
 a carved door dating back to 1370     
 which serves as the main entrance.    
 There is a beautifully  carved rood   
 screen which divides the nave from the
 chancel.                              
 About 50 people a week attend the     
 communion service on Sunday and about 
 200 midnight mass on Chistmas Eve.The 
 church is on a hill above the famous, 
 picturesque duck pond and green so    
 popular with tourists.                </content>
