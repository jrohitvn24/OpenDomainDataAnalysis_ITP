     When the railway line was there it
 made big traffic jams because there   
 were gates across the road.Now Andover
 has a by_pass which goes right round  
 the town.                             
     Today there are no traffic lights 
 in town instead we have mini          
 roundabouts which are better.Mr       
 Tempero said that the best things in  
 Andover today are the Sports centre   
 and Cricklade College.There are 9     
 primary schools in town and 3 senior  
 schools and the 6th form College.     
     Mr Tempero liked Andover best when
 it was a small little market town and 
 he was editor of the Andover          
 Advertiser.
