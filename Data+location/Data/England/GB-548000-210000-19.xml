		<content> At playtime we dip for games like this
 "Did you clean your shoes last night? 
 O.U.T. spells OUT."                   
                                       
{The boys like to play Bundles but is  
{is not really allowed. It usually ends
{with the boys in a big heap. The boys'
{best game is Kiss Chase. The girls    
{like playing but not the kissing.}    
                                       
 The girls play hand-stands. Someone   
 says, "Knives, forks, spoons, spears."
 and calls the name of a hand-stand,   
 like Jelly Wobbles or Policeman. The  
 one who stays up longest becomes the  
 caller. Sometimes we play Hopscotch   
 but that is mostly the girls.         
                                       
{We enjoy playtime but we don't like   
{going in and we argue about who is    
{going to hold the door open.}
