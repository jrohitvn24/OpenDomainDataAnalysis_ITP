		<content> The castle,one of the most interesting
 aspects of local history in Newark was
 built by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1129
 The Gate House has changed and now    
 forms part of a large restoration plan
 Many areas of the castle are now being
 restored using the skills of craftsmen
 and stonemasons.Below the Gate House  
 is the Bottle Dungeon and beneath the 
 Great Hall's Oriel window is the Water
 Gate giving tourists access to the    
 castle from the River Trent.Another   
 interesting Newark Building is the Oss
 -ington Coffee Palace near the River  
 Trent.It was built in 1882 by Viscount
 -ess Ossington.Originally built for   
 temperance purposes it has now been   
 restored and it is a licenced restau  
 -rant.Across the River Trent is the   
 Cattle Market which holds weekly      
 sales.The thriving Railway Station    
 connects with Nottingham and Lincoln. </content>
