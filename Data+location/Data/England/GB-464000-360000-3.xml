		<title>03ECOLOGY IN EAKRING</title>
		<content> One of the nicest things about Eakring
 are the Green Lanes which radiate from
 and around the village. These came in 
 to existence when Eakring had mills   
 and other villages came via the Green 
 Lanes. They remained because Eakring  
 had an Open Field System until the war
 and are still used as farm tracks and 
 footpaths. Dukes, Redgate and         
 Pudding Poke woods were declared a    
 Site of Special Scientific Interest,  
 undisturbed since the nodding donkey  
 oil pumps had been installed. The     
 habitat had grown without any outside 
 influence such as herbicides or       
 pesticides. Over 60 different species 
 of birds have been identified of which
 50 are known to be breeding, including
 the nightingale. It is currently      
 planned to create an archaeological   
 nature trail.
