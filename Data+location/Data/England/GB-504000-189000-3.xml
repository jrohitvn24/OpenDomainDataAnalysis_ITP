		<title>03PLANNING PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> The area lies toward the outer limit  
 of the London Green Belt and as such  
 it has some quite particular problems 
 of planning.The local conservation    
 group monitors the changes that take  
 place and have opposed those which    
 threaten village landmarks e.g. The   
 Malt House and the Old Workhouse.The  
 visual integrity of early council     
 estates (Vernon Drive) and Victorian  
 terraces (Newdigate Road) has been    
 destroyed by owner occupation and     
 subsequent ad hoc improvements. Many  
 changes require no planning permission
 and the nearby M25 increases pressure 
 to convert shops to offices and to    
 develop Green Belt land.In all        
 instances employment prospects must be
 balanced against  loss of amenities   
 and an attempt to reconcile           
 commercial,personal and public        
 interests.                            </content>
