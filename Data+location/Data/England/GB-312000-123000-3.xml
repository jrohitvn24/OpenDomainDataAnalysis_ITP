		<content>     WE TALKED TO THE VICAR ABOUT      
 HIMSELF AND HIS JOB. PEOPLE USE THE   
 CHURCH A LOT. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
 7 CHRISTENINGS THIS YEAR. THERE ARE   
 USUALLY 2 FUNERALS A MONTH, THOUGH    
 THERE ARE NORMALLY MORE FUNERALS IN   
 THE WINTER MONTHS. THIS YEAR THERE    
 HAVE BEEN 5 WEDDINGS IN THE CHURCH.   
                                       
     THE VICAR TOLD US HE ENJOYED HIS  
 JOB A LOT, ESPECIALLY VISITING PEOPLE 
 AND GETTING TO KNOW THE PEOPLE IN THE 
 PARISH. THE VICAR ENJOYS TAKING HOLY  
 COMMUNION BECAUSE IT IS THE CHURCH'S  
 MOST IMPORTANT SERVICE.               
                                       
     WHEN THE VICAR IS NOT TAKING      
 A SERVICE HE WRITES HIS SERMON AND    
 ARTICLES FOR THE PARISH MAGAZINE. HIS 
 LAST JOB WAS IN LIVERPOOL, WHICH WAS  
 VERY DIFFERENT FROM MILVERTON.
