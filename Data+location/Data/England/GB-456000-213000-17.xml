		<title>17CHANGES IN CHARLTON (1)</title>
		<content> We had a shop in Charlton by the Bus  
Garage but it closed down two years    
ago.                                   
 Across the road from the Bus Garage   
there was a Post Office and a shop but 
it has been made into a house now and  
it's called The Old Post Office. The   
person who owned it was called Mr      
Coates.                                
 Many of the houses in Charlton are    
fairly new because they have been      
improved.The only old one by our       
School is Mr Butler's but there are    
some more old houses elsewhere around  
the village. Twelve years ago some     
houses cost eight thousand pounds but  
now they can cost sixty nine thousand  
pounds.                                
 We did have two pubs.They were called 
THE GEORGE AND DRAGON and THE CROWN.Now
we have only got one pub because THE   
GEORGE AND DRAGON has closed down.     </content>
