		<content>    The{doctors' surgery}serves 4,800  
 people from a wide area and has four  
 doctors - three partners and one      
 trainee. Twelve other people are      
 employed as nurses, receptionists,    
 dispensers and cleaners. Two district 
 nurses, a health visitor and a midwife
 are shared with other practices.      
    The "treatment area" in the surgery
 is very advanced and well equipped;   
 many casualties are treated           
 here and minor operations are         
 performed which would otherwise       
 require referral to the nearest major 
 hospital (at King's Lynn). Children's 
 clinics are also held at the surgery. 
    The practice dispenses medicines   
 for those who live further than one   
 mile away from the dispensing chemist 
 in the village.                       
    A{chiropodist}visits the village   
 hall regularly.                       </content>
