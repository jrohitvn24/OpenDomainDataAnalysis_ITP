		<title>14WINDRIDGE FARM</title>
		<content> The farm is called Windridge Farm.It  
 was not very windy when we went on our
 walk.It was a roasting hot day. Our   
 teacher took some orange to drink and 
 we had a rest.Mr. Hooper runs it with 
 his two sons.His farmland and a farm  
 house were mentioned in the original  
{Domesday book.}This year his main crop
 is Oilseed Rape. He also grows        
 Barley.To guard the house he has some 
 noisy dogs.When the land is very      
 dry,in an exceptionally hot summer,the
 paddock behind the house shows        
 evidence of Belgic round houses. The  
 Fields abound in flint and often      
 during ploughing flint tools and flint
 pot boilers are found.Coins from the  
{Roman}era and pottery pieces are to be
 picked up over the land.
