		<title>03 MOOREDGE FARM.</title>
		<content>Mooredge farm has been here since 1920 
and the people that work the farm now  
are Mr.and Mrs. Davidson.The man who   
owns the farm is a man called Eric     
Watson.                                
They keep sheep and bullocks and grow  
Barley and grain because these are the 
most profitable.They have lived here   
for the past 8 years and the only      
changes they made is to have the farm  
painted.                               
Mrs Davidson said that she had heard   
that there may be a motor-way running  
through them.She says if this happens  
she will move back to the Cheviots.She 
would not like to move as she likes    
the area but she could not take to     
a main road running so near to her     
farm.She likes the farm because it is  
healthy for the children but machinery 
can be dangerous.
