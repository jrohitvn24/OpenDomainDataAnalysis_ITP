		<title>01Life in Birch Wood,Tiptree</title>
		<content> Birch Wood contains quite a lot of    
 different types of trees including    
 Birch, Oak, Ash, Willow, Beech and    
 Sweet Chestnut. Roughly in the middle 
 of the wood is a reservoir and by that
 a murky pond. The reservoir is a place
 where many people fish. The pond next 
 to it contains many newts,even some   
 Great Crested Newts. The bird life on 
 the water is two ducks, eight         
 ducklings, two moorhens and a group of
 four baby moorhens. Also when we were 
 looking around, that was Nicky,       
 Johnathan,Richard,Peter,Mrs Beal and  
 I.We saw Dragonflies and many plants. 
 In trees were squirrels, and a dray,  
 and a Freshwater Mussel, that was     
 probably taken from the reservoir. We 
 found Woodpecker holes without        
 Woodpeckers. We saw Jay and Owl       
 feathers.They were definately Jays    
 because they had a blue mark.         </content>
