		<content> We decided to find out were the       
{heads of the families}worked. If he   
 (as it usually was) worked{inside}the 
 village,{outside}the village or if    
 they were{unemployed (retired).}Twenty
 seven people worked in the village and
 seventy six people out of the village 
 and there were seventy one unemployed,
 sixty eight of these people are       
 retired. All together{174 houses}were 
{surveyed}which is over half the       
 village. The most unemployed people   
 live in Woodlands because there is a  
 large number of bungalows. Most people
 who live in Red Barn Lane work in the 
 village.Most people who live in       
 Hamford Drive and Sparrows cornner    
 work outside the village.
