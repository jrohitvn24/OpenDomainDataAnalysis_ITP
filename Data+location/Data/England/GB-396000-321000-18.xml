		<title>18TOURISM IN GREAT HAYWOOD</title>
		<content>  When we did our survey we questioned 
visitors about the area.               
  The main attraction is Shugborough   
Hall and its gardens. Other people just
pass through or visit relatives.       
  We interviewed some people from      
London and they said that they liked   
the village and the area around it. For
most of them it was their first time   
here, but they said they liked it and  
would come again.                      
  The canal brings tourists to the     
village.                               
  We also interviewed some Canadians on
a canal holiday. They stayed two or    
three days and went sightseeing.       
  Some people said they would like to  
live here but the others preferred     
their own community.                   
  If more people started visiting,the  
shops would get more money. The public 
house could offer accomodation.        </content>
