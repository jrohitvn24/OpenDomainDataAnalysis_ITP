  NEAR GREAT BOWDEN SCHOOL THERE IS A  
 HOUSE CALLED STONE HOUSE,THE HOUSE IS 
 IN A PRIVATE ROAD.STONE HOUSE WAS     
 BUILT IN 1671 AND IN 1773 SOME        
 ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE ON THE HOUSE    
 (THEY WERE MADE OF BRICK).            
                                       
 AT THE END OF THE PRIVATE ROAD THERE  
 IS A GATE,IT WAS PUT THERE TO STOP    
 PEOPLE CROSSING THE TRAIN TRACK (WHICH
 WAS BEHIND THE GATE).WE NOW HAVE A    
 BRIDGE,  BUT WE STILL USE THE THE     
 TRAIN TRACK BUT WE DO NOT USE THE GATE
 AS A CROSSING ANY-MORE .              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
