		<title>15The May Day Festival</title>
		<content> Ickwell is probably  most famous for  
 its May Day Festival.Its historical   
 roots go back to Roman times.  The    
 dancing takes place today round the   
 permanently erected Maypole on Ickwell
  Green. The pole is red and white and 
 on the top is a copper crown which was
 added in 1191.On May Bank Holiday     
 Monday the carnival takes place during
 which the May Queen is presented with 
 a gold locket.  All the money         
 collected by the "Moggers"is donated  
 to charity and all the children who   
 take part usually get some sort of    
 treat.  All around the green are      
 stalls selling sweets, antiques etc., 
 and usually there are a lot of        
 competitions.  The procession of      
 dancers starts in Northill (1/2 a mile
 away)with the"Queen of the May"on the 
 first float.                          
                                       </content>
