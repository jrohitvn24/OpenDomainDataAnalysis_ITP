		<content> There is only sparce population in    
 this area, and the number of families 
 are usually employed in the           
 surrounding area, or commute to larger
 towns or cities for business.  As a   
 result many wives are employed and    
 therefore to some extent convenience  
 food is useful. However, many of the  
 farmers in the area still believe in  
 good wholesome meals and the Sunday   
 roast. T.V. and video play a large    
 part in home entertainment, although  
 many of the children are members of   
 the Scout and Guide movements in the  
 district.  Many youngsters go to the  
 Youth club in Halsall School, a little
 distance away. The tradition of       
 Saturday jobs for teenagers continues 
 and many find work on the local farms.
 The annual Rose Queen celebration     
 gives many a chance to enjoy sports   
 etc in the village.                   </content>
