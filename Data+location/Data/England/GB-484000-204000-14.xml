 In the heart of the Chiltern Hills    
 stands one of the most famous houses  
 in Britain, the country home of our   
 Prime Ministers. Chequers Court was   
 bequeathed to the nation for this     
 purpose as a thanksgiving for the     
 Allied victory in the Great War       
 1914_1918, by Lord Lee of Fareham. In 
 the Deed of Settlement he hoped that  
 the 'high and pure air of the hills   
 and woods would be an antedote to the 
 strenuous and resposible labours' of  
 our political leaders. Since that time
 each succeeding Premier, exept Bonar  
 Law, has used this beautiful house in 
 its peaceful park for relaxing        
 weekends, and possibly because of its 
 isolated location, frequently for     
 conferences. Many world leaders have  
 been entertained there.
