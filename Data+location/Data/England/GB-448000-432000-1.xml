		<content>{A Gazeteer of Sherburn In Elmet.}     
 Sherburn In Elmet is a thriving       
 village in North Yorkshire, situated  
 at the southern end of the Vale of    
 York.It was once the eastern capital  
 of the ancient Brigantine Kingdom of  
 Elmete, and the 16th. century church  
 and the 17th. century old gabled      
 Hungate School are particularly worthy
 of note.The village has developed     
 round the crossroads where the A162   
 from Ferrybridge to Tadcaster and the 
 B1222 from Leeds to York meet.It was  
 on the ancient route between          
 Pontefract and York castles which     
 avoided crossing the nearby fens.It is
 just 13 miles from Leeds,13 miles from
 York,5 miles from Tadcaster and 9     
 miles from Selby.It owes its rapid    
 development in recent years to the    
 nearby Selby Coalfield and the        
 expansion of the local trading estate.</content>
