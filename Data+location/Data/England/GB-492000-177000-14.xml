		<title>14THE RIVER AT BOVENEY LOCK</title>
		<content>                                       
 Before this lock was called{Boveney   
{Lock}it was called{Baddie Lock.}Each  
 lock - keeper supervises three miles  
 of water. The lock keeper is{Mr. David
{Gibson.}He has to maintain the water  
 level, give a safe passage to the     
 boats; these are the tasks of a lock -
 keeper.                               
                                       
 A boat takes ten minutes maximum to   
 pass through. When a large boat       
 arrives he lets the tugs and barges   
 through first. The busiest time for a 
 lock - keeper is August. Then the     
 average amount of boats that go       
 through in a day is 360. There have   
 only been minor accidents like rope   
 burns and cut arms.                   
                                       
 In the winter{Mr. Gibson}has to break 
 some ice and lay down salt.           </content>
