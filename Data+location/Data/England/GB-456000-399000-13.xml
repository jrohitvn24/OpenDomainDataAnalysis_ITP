		<title>13FIRST SCHOOL EDUCATION BALBY</title>
		<content> Our school was built in 1930. The     
 mayor of the time Mr. Cookes opened   
 it. There is a plaque to say so. The  
 school is made of red brick and is a  
 hollow rectangle. There are 18        
 classrooms. A typical classroom is    
 square. Most classrooms have a        
 blackboard on one wall, display frieze
 on the opposite wall and a sink unit. 
 There is a carpeted area for a book   
 corner. A third wall is mostly        
 windows. The fourth wall is glass and 
 looks onto the corridor. The corridors
 are 136 metres long with fire doors at
 each end. We have 2 rectangular halls 
 used for assemblies and physical      
 education. There are 12 teachers. In  
 the middle of the school is a         
 quadrangle with trees, grass and      
 flowers. School hours are 8.55am to   
 3.30pm. Terms are Autumn, Spring and  
 Summer. The children are 5 to 9 years.</content>
