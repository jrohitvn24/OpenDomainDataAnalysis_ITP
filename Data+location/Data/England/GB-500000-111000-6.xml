		<title>06CHURCHES IN BURY &amp; HOUGHTON</title>
		<content> There are 3 churches, two of Church   
 of England denomination, whilst the   
 other is Roman Catholic. The first two
 churches are very old being started in
 the late 12th century, whilst the R.C.
 church in Houghton is a modern        
 building. As is usual in these days,  
 the sizes of the congregations are    
 relatively small in the old churches  
 of the united parish of Bury with     
 Houghton; but the R.C. Church has a   
 larger congregation due, inter alia,  
 to serving a much wider area.         
 The older churches have many Norman   
 features and in the Bury church a door
 outline which gave easy access from   
 Bury Manor can be seen in the north   
 wall. Dorset House schoolboys attend  
 services there every other Saturday   
 morning during term time; the choir   
 consists of some of those boys with   
 the school music master as organist.  </content>
