		<title>19The Old People</title>
		<content>                                       
  There seem to be a lot of old people 
about.                                 
  The Acreage is a block of dwellings  
for old people. There is a warden who  
can keep an eye on them just in case   
they have problems.                    
  Most old people live in their own    
houses, many alone &amp; of course they    
prefer it that way.                    
  Meals are cooked at the school       
several times a week and taken round   
by the "Meals on Wheels" volunteers to 
those who cannot manage for themselves.
 The visiting Chiropidist, Doctors'    
Surgery and Physiotherapy at Watlington
hospital can all be very important.    
 We could all be more aware of the     
often simple things that would make the
life of the aged fuller, like just     
visiting or running errands.
