		<content>   Today children like to make         
 collections of many and varied things.

 it possible for{collections}to be     
 easily obtained.                      
   The idea of collecting is a         
 challenge,nice to look back upon,to   
 add to or to talk to your friends     
 about.                                
   Less than 12% did not have a        
 collection at all,35% of collections  
 were based on toys and 35% were based 
 on pictorial material.

 hobbies.{Cubs and Brownies}were       
 attended by half the children whilst  
 football,dancing,judo,swimming and    
 riding commanded less interest.
