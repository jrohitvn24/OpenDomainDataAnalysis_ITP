		<title>19 CUDHAM - GARAGE</title>
		<content> Taking the place of the old village   
blacksmith in the vital area of        
transport is the modern garage. Cudham 
garage is a family business situated in
the centre of the village and occupies 
a building thought to be 80-100 years  
old and at one time housing the village
wheelwright.                           
 The garage employs four full-time and 
two part-time men to do car services,  
repairs, Ministry of Transport Tests   
and attend breakdowns and accidents.   
 Clients come from a area of 8-9 miles 
in radius. The garage is open Mon-Sat  
and performs as many as 70-80 M.O.T.s  
a week with August being the busiest   
month.  An M.O.T. test takes 20-30     
minutes to complete and takes place in 
a special bay, which may have to be    
enlarged in the future.                
 The garage sells an average of 200    
gallons of petrol a day.               </content>
