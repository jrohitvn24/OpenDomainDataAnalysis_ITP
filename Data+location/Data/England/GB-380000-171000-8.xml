 Corps of Transport has four squadrons 
 three at Colerne which are 90         
 squadron,57 squadron and 30 squadron  
 and 32 squadron at Driffield. There   
 are 700 Junior Leaders on the camp.   
 Their training involves driving cars, 
 trucks and riding motorbikes. They    
 start off on simulators until they are
 used to the controls. They are also   
 taught how to maintain the vehicle and
 its engine. After this basic training 
 the Junior Leaders may progress to    
 other transport work such as Air      
 Despatching, Parachuting, Radio       
 Operating and lots more. The Junior   
 Leaders also do things for the        
 community like sweeping snow and      
 keeping the Church yard tidy.The      
 Junior Leaders also have a band which 
 they play on special occasions.
