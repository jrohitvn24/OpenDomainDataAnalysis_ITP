		<title>14RELIGION IN CHURCH MINSHULL</title>
		<content> The religious life of this area is    
 centred round two buildings.          
 The largest is a typical English      
 country church, where members of the{ 
{Church of England}worship in decreas- 
 ing numbers, 10-20 at a normal Sunday 
 service, although many more attend    
 festival services. The present vicar, 
 the Rev.P.Gains was inducted into the 
 twin parishes of Church Minshull and  
 Leighton cum Minshull Vernon, in 1959,
 and will retire in 1986.              
 Cross Lanes Chapel was built in 1809  
 by the Congregational Church, which   
 became the{United Reform Church}in    
 recent years. The regular minister    
 is the Rev. Paul Frampton. Only eight 
 members belong to the chapel but      
 numbers increase with visitors from   
 other areas. A very small part of the 
 population is of{Catholic or other    
{faith.                                </content>
