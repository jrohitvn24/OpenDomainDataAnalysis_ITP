 Fishing. There is good fishing in the 
 Bay when the tide is in but it        
 improves out at sea. Cod, haddock,    
 whiting, plaice and shellfish such as 
 crab and lobster are landed. Several  
 kinds of bait may be found on the     
 beach and artificial bait bought at   
 the local shop.                       
 Museum. Next to the old mortuary at   
 Fisher Head is the old coroner's room.
 It houses many local exhibits.
