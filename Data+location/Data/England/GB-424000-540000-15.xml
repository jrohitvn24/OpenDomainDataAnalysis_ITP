		<content> In the city many things have changed. 
 The timetable of schools has become   
 less demanding with beginning and     
 finishing times getting closer        
 together.                             
  As for{unemployment,}Durham has      
 suffered with the rest of the country,
 though the problem has been mainly    
 confined to the rural areas.New roads 
 have been built around Durham making  
 travel easier.Framwellgate and Elvet  
 bridges have been closed to traffic   
 and two new bridges built to          
 substitute them.                      
  Living conditions have improved a lot
 around Durham since the 1930's.       
  There used to be two theatres in     
 Durham,but with the building of new   
 roads one had to be knocked down.     
{ The Church}used to influence society 
 a lot but now its influence is very   
 small.                                </content>
