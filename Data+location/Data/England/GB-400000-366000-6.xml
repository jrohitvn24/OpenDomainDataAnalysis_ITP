		<title>06Sheep Farming at Manor Farm</title>
		<content> In October the farmer buys the ewes   
 from Kendal Market in the Lake        
 District. They are four years old when
 he buys them. The name of the ewes is 
 Rough Fell and the rams are Blue      
 Faced Leicesters, so the lambs are a  
 cross. In May, at lambing time, the   
 farmer has to check the sheep five    
 times every day, in case a sheep is   
 having trouble lambing. This year they
 have 230 lambs but there are still    
 some more lambs to be born. In June   
 they have to shear the sheep. They    
 mark the sheep with a blue stripe on  
 the shoulder. The farmer keeps the    
 sheep until they are about 8 years    
 old.                                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
