		<content>  Middleton-One-Row has developed      
 slowly over the past centuries and    
 there is now no discernable boundary  
 between this village and the adjoining
 village of Middleton St. George.The   
 main street has also developed over a 
 number of years and therefore the age 
 and style of the housing varies a     
 great deal but most have an           
 exceptionally beautiful view over the 
 River Tees.                           
  The steep bank down to the river is  
 grassed and tree lined, and a very    
 popular visiting place during the     
 summer months for the people of the   
 surrounding district                  
  Most of the residents travel to work 
 in Darlington, Durham and Teeside area
 and whilst there is a bus service to  
 and from Darlington, the village has  
 no Post Office or shop.
