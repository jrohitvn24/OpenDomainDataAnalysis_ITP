		<content>    My first impression of Uckfield    
 when I arrived in September 1918      
 ferried by a{Model T.Ford Taxi}with   
 polished brass radiator and cap, was  
 of a one sided, one street town,for   
 town it was. We had a{market}every    
 Wednesday and cattle were driven down 
 through the High Street to the site   
 below Gateways.                       
    The old gas standards lighted the  
 town and the old{lamplighter}used to  
 go round with his long pole at dusk   
 and dawn. He used to have less to     
 do at dawn because some of the        
 boys used to shin up the lamppost and 
 put them out.If the local bobby,{P.C. 
{Pearce},by name, used to catch any,   
 he gave us a slash with the old cape  
 he always carried. This was accepted  
 as a just punishment and I must say I 
 never remember any violence or        
 vandalism at all in that period.      </content>
