		<content>  Opposite our school are two garages. 
We went to talk to their owners.       
          *** LOOK CARS ***            
  Look Cars only sells cars,they sell  
about six cars a week.Their most       
expensive cars cost 2000 pounds,their  
cheapest cars cost about 900 pounds.   
The best car they ever sold was a

radios and cars.They buy all their     
cars from other garages.

hours.He told us he enjoys his work.His
son helps him in the garage.
