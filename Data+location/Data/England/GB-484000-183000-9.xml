		<title>09WOODLANDS FARM, COOKHAM DEAN</title>
		<content>   Woodlands Farm is situated on the   
 edge of Cookham Dean village. It is   
 owned by Mr Simmonds who is a member  
 of the European Parliament. It is     
 quite an old farm, the farm-house     
 dates back to the 1800's.             
   Two main activities are carried out 
 at the farm: the rearing of poultry,  
 and stabling of horses for local      
 people.                               
   The farm has over 1500 Isiss Browns,
 which are being reared in a rather    
 different way. They live in a very    
 large coop, one side of which has a   
 number of doors so that the birds can 
 roam over the adjacent fields to look 
 for food. However, they are also fed  
 three times a day with pelletised feed
 in the chicken house. This method is a
 cross between battery feeding, and    
 free range. It is quite expensive, but
 the the eggs certainly tasted good!   </content>
