On Wednesday 19th June 1985, Michael   
Forgione, Stewart Manning, Lee French  
and myself ( Gurjinder Bassan) went to 
Ayrshire Metal Products to ask Peter   
Ramsdon some questions about the       
factory. We were going in Mr Osborns   
car. When we got there , we went in the
main entrance door . Then we waited for
Peter Ramsdon, but he could not come so
Mr Sergeant showed us around.          
When he showed us around we saw a      
machine which rolled out the metal     
sheets and gradually bent the metal    
into sort of corrugated metal sheets,  
which you canuse for roofs and some for
the walls. Mr Ramsdon talked to us     
about what materials the metal was made
of and the coating, plus the colours   
you can have. We also saw a shed made  
ofmetal they produced and we saw a lady
who was driving a truck to Holland.    </content>
