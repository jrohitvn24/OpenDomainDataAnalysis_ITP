		<title>04ALKHAM CLUBS AND SOCIETIES</title>
		<content>  The most thriving club, the Women's  
 Institute, meet every second Tuesday  
 in the Village Hall. The Over 6O's    
 Club is a social club which organises 
 outings and coffee mornings. A local  
 Good Neighbours Club holds jumble     
 sales and whist drives, the money     
 raised is used for the benefit of the 
 village and finaces a childrens       
 Christmas party. There is a           
 conservation based society, The Alkham
 Valley Society, established to protect
 the local environment and amenities.  
 Alkham Cricket Club is based in the   
 village, using the local Vicarage     
 meadow and pavilion, but few members  
 now reside in the village. The        
 locality supports two equestrian      
 societies. There are no clubs for     
 children in the area. On occasions    
 there have been a pre-school play     
 group, Sunday school and youth club.  </content>
