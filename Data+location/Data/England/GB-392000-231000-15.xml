		<title>15Our Homes</title>
		<content> This page is about two people's homes;
 one in the country and one on an      
 estate. I (Joelle) live right out in  
 the country.We live in Natton.We are  
 building an extension.When it is      
 finished we will have 13 rooms.Our    
 house is called Vine Cottage.While my 
 dad was building our house we lived in
 a chalet which had 3 rooms.We live    
 near a disused Baptist graveyard, and 
 at the very end of a country lane.    
  My home (Linzi's)is a bungalow.We    
 live in Northway near Tewkesbury.When 
 we first moved in a man lived there   
 with 4 afghan hounds.We have 6 rooms. 
 They are a bathroom,3 bedrooms,1      
 lounge (which we had an extension     
 built on) and 1 kitchen (which was 2  
 rooms). Before we moved in and before 
 the man before us moved in,the site of
 our house was a farm.There is still a 
 cornfield and a farm nearby.          </content>
