		<content> The village school is still standing  
 but it is now a private house,lived in
 by the Scott family.My name is        
 Bryonnie Scott. Much of the building  
 has been changed, the one large room  
 was the full height of the building   
 and is now two storeys.In the kitchen 
 there is a wall which was the outside 
 wall. Inside the house there is a     
 windowless cupboard under the stairs  
 which was known as the Punishment     
 Cupboard since children were put there
 if they were naughty!                 
  Today children from Burton Lazars go 
 to school in nearby Melton,firstly to 
 Sherard Primary School then on to     
 Sarson High School.
