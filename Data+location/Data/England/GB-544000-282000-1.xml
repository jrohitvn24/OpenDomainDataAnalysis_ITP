		<title>01The Ouse Washes</title>
		<content> The main features are the new nd old  
 bedford rivers running arallel in a   
 north-easterrly direction.  these are 
 man made, and their purpose is to     
 drain the surrounding land which is at
 sea level. The area between the river 
 is wash land which is liable to flood 
 during the winter, and used for       
 grazing in the summer.  the remaining 
 land in the area is used for arable   
 farming, the main crops being wheat,  
 barley and sugar beet.  There are few 
 @people living in the area; there is  
 the smll village of Wardy Hill in the 
 South East corner, and isolated farms.
  Most people make their living from   
 the land which provides high yields.  
 The Bedford rivers are very popular   
 ewith anglers, and are regaded as     
 being among the best fishing waters in
 the country.  The washes also attract 
 a wide varity of migrant wide life.   </content>
