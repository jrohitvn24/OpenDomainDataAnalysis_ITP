		<content>{SCHOOL COTTAGES.}The 3 pairs of semi- 
 detached cottages with a small garden 
 and yard  built in 1888 for farm      
 workers are now privately owned. The  
 outside is half brick and at the top  
 black and white. They have heavy      
 framed windows, all the doors are the 
 same--white with black round the edge.
 The store-room is now a bathroom.The  
 pig-shed now stores fuel.The well is  
 covered up.The pantry still has hooks 
 on which meat was hung.The back door  
 is split like a stable door.

 1 farm worker still lives there.They  
 have been modernised with new doors   
 and double-glazed windows.Extra       
 electric sockets and central heating  
 have been put in.Most are owner       
 occupied.
