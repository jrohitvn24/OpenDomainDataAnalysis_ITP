		<content> The Parent Teacher Association        
 consists of a group of interested     
 parents and teachers . The committee  
 is chaired by the Headteacher Mrs.    
 Patman. Their aim is fund raising with
 a view to buy items for the school    
 which are no longer available through 
 the County Council because of         
 financial cutbacks. These items are   
 chosen by the staff and Head. In the  
 year 1984/85 the P.T.A. purchased     
 another computer, a xylophone,        
 football shirts, netball bibs, music  
 stands as well as paying the T.V.     
 insurance. There are social events and
 talks. We hope these will encourage   
 parents who are not very keen on      
 committees, organising etc. to        
 participate in school life and benefit
 the children's education.
