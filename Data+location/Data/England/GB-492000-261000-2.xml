		<content>    Dad has to get up at seven o'clock.
 He goes to work at 7.30a.m.  He is a  
 farm worker.  He drives a John Deere  
 and doew all the baling, fertilizing, 
 spraying, hedge cutting, fencing and  
 ditching.  He works until 5 o'clock.  
 At harvest time he works until 9 or 10
 o'clock at night.                     
   Mum gets up to make Dad's breakfast 
 and prepare his lunch.  Then she gets 
 my brother and I ready for school. She
 makes our breakfast. I have Weetabix. 
 She gives us a wash and takes us to   
 school. At half past eleven Mum comes 
 to school to work in the kitchen and  
 get the dinners ready. Mum does all   
 the washing and ironing.  Sometimes   
 when my Dad is working late I help to 
 cut the lawns and do the gardening.
