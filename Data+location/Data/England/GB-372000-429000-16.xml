The principle traditions of Western    
Christianity have churches in the area,
the oldest being Church Kirk. In 642   
when King Oswald marched south it is   
likely that he had a wooden sanctuary  
erected here. In June 1985, after a    
laps of many years, the parish had an  
outdoor procession involving 250       
people. In 1812 in Clayton-le-Moors a  
Society of Methodists began. The two   
chapels on Barnes Square were          
demolished and in 1981 the old school  
was converted into a church. In 1886 a 
Roman Catholic parish was set up in    
Rishton. The Hermitage was used for    
worship until 1896 when the school was 
built. The church of St. Charles dates 
from 1938. As a result of this         
religious influence, most of the       
primary schools are church schools.
