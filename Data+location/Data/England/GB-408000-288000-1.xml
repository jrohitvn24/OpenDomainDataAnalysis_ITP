		<title>01A day in the life of Kevin.</title>
		<content>A typical day for me begins at 7.15    
when the alarm goes off.Breakfast is at
7.30 and consists of cereal,toast and  
fruit juice.After breakfast I get ready
for school and at 8.00 I go to my      
friends house because they take me to  
school.At 9.00 a teacher blows the     
whistle and school begins.Lessons start
after class prayers.I spend the morning
doing religion,maths,english or topic. 
We play football at playtime which is  
from 10.45 to 11.00.Lunch is at 12.00  
and today we had sausages,chips and    
beans.After lunch we play until 1.00.  
In the afternoon we go swimming and I  
have passed my 400 metres badge.We come
back at 2.45 and have a spelling test. 
Then we have play and after that we do 
individual topic work.School finishes  
at 3.30.When I get home I like to play 
on my computer with my friend or play  
games outside.                         </content>
