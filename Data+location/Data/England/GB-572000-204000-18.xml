		<content>{The Sutton Trust.}Our school stands in
 the middle of an estate of houses     
 originally owned by Marconi Wireless  
 for its management employees. In {1970
 these homes were sold to the Sutton   
 Trust.It exists for people with low   
 incomes.}It has 276 homes in Great    
 Baddow alone. It was founded by       
 William R. Sutton. He left Â£1\ million
 in his will. The Trust still has a lot
 of money because they keep investing  
 it.Mr Gavin the Estate Manager came to
 talk about the Sutton Trust.You only  
 have to look after the back gardens.  
 Secondary double glazing only is      
 allowed so the exterior appearance is 
 not changed.Mr Gavin's staff keep the 
 grass cut for you. Once a year he     
 visits each house to see if it is     
 being kept clean. Trust employees do  
 not have to pay rent.
