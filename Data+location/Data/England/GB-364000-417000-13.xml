		<content> As the last glaciers retreated, they  
 left behind a thick layer of boulder  
 clay on the lower ground, whilst the  
 higher ground, being above the level  
 of the ice, did not have this layer.  
 The rocks themselves are a modified   
 sandstone, usually called gritstone   
 with Millstone grit being common.  The
 geological fault at High Shores is    
 visited quite often by geologists as  
 it is a unique type of fault.  Coal   
 mining was common during the 19th     
 century, with disused shafts being    
 found on Darwen Moor in the east.  The
 Trial Shaft near Pimms farm is thought
 to have been for water.  Lead mines   
 were also present in the extreme      
 south-western area, leading down into 
 Leadmines Valley or Limestone Clough.
