{Victoria,}and the opening of the{Grand

 the  people of Crewe by the{London and
{North Western Railway.                
 There are lots of things to do in the 
 park. There is a lake and you can fish
 in it or hire a boat. In the lake     
 there is an island.This is a war      
 memorial called{Burma Star Island.    
 There are beautiful flower gardens; a 
 crazy golf course; a childrens play   
 ground; a small pets cage; two        
 bandstands; and a cafe. The cafe is   
 called the{Jubilee Cafe}because it was
 opened in 1977_the Queen's Jubilee

 by fire. The park is a very quiet and 
 peaceful place.                       </content>
