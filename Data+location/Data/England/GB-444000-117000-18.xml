		<title>18EMPLOYMENT IN EASTLEIGH</title>
		<content>  There are jobs for more than 30,000  
 people in Eastleigh.Most are in the   
 light industry and commercial areas.  
  The main reason for companies coming 
 to the area are all linked with the   
 excellent communications available by 
 air,road(especially with the new M27  
 motorway now opened),and rail to the  
 port of Southampton not far away.     
  Most of the jobs are within trading  
 estates such as Boyatt Wood and       
 Chickenhall Lane.These small estates  
 have been built near to houses so that
 they provide local jobs but do not    
 swamp the area.                       
  The types of jobs are varied;        
 precision engineering,boatbuilding,   
 electronics,printing,car manufacture, 
 construction,cable production,film    
 setting,food processing,haulage,      
 farming,horticulture and many more.   
 Many have received Queens Awards.     </content>
