		<content> "What Time Is It Mister Wolf" is a    
 popular local game. It is played with 
 as many people as you like. The person
 who is on stands with their back to   
 the rest of the people. The one who is
 on is the wolf. The children shout    
 "What time is it Mister Wolf? and he  
 replies any time of the day or        
 dinnertime. If he shouts dinnertime he
 runs after them. If he catches someone
 that person is the on.                
 "Red Rover" is played with 2 teams    
 standing opposite one another holding 
 hands in a long line. One team calls  
 to the other "Red Rover, Red Rover we 
 want" and then the name of a person in
 the opposite team. That person runs   
 and tries to break through the arms of
 the other team. If you break through  
 you stay on that side. At the end of  
 the game the team with most people    
 wins.                                 </content>
