		<title>11DAIRY FARMING (COW CARE)</title>
		<content> In summer the cows go out in the      
 fields to graze.When the grass is     
 short the cows go to another field and
 the farmers will tillage and slurry   
 the short grass field to make it grow 
 again.Then he can put the cows back on
 it.The farmer will keep some fields   
 for sillaging,he will cut it then pick
 it up with a sillorator and lead it   
 back with a trailer and tip it in a   
 heap.Then he covers it with plastic   
 and tyres to keep it dry.In winter the
 cows come into sheds,they eat sillage 
 and are still milked.They lie in      
 cubicles most of the day and have     
 straw or sawdust to lie on.The farmer 
 may raise calves.They drink milk from 
 the tank but as they get older they   
 eat barley and cake then they go out  
 to eat grass.He will keep heifers for 
 the milk herd but will fatten bullocks
 on cake barley and sugarbeet for beef.</content>
