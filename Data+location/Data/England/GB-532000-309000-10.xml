		<content> There are often rabbits around the    
 fenland in Gedney Hill.They are quite 
 popular around here.                  
    The birds common to this area      
 are swallows,swans,herons,jackdaws,   
 swifts,crows,thrushes,pheasants and   
 black birds.We get quite a few birds  
 around here because we don't get a lot
 of traffic on the roads and it is     
 quiet.                                
    I have got a partridge and a       
 skylark nesting quietly in my garden. 
    Foxes are seen quite a lot at      
 night.The fox is a carnivorous        
 creature and eats: chickens,geese,    
 pheasants,hares and rabbits etc..     
 Around Gedney Hill they are sometimes 
 seen carrying things off in their     
 mouths.                               
    Many mice are found in the area,   
 particularly in dustbins,rubbish-dumps
 and other unhealthy places.           </content>
