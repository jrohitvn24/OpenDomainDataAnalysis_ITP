		<title>08The Nypro Explosion 1</title>
		<content> I was having a nap:my husband was out 
 gardening.Suddenly I was woken by my  
 husband trying to open the door it    
 seemed to be jammed.Then the front    
 window shattered and blew in.Before I 
 knew what had happened there was the  
 loudest bang I had ever heard.At first
 I thought it was the gas cooker.After 
 we had been told not to go inside the 
 police evacuated everyone to the      
 technical college in Scunthorpe where 
 a hot meal was waiting.It was a few   
 days before we knew the cause of the  
 explosion.Our house was one of the    
 most damaged in Burton but it wasn't  
 as bad as the ones in Flixborough. I  
 thought that the rescue services were 
 excellent the way they worked.28 men  
 died in this terrible disaster.This   
 was one of the saddest events I can   
 remember.
