		<title>14A Vicar's Life:Chatteris</title>
		<content>    The vicar of St Peter and St Paul  
 has been looking after the church for 
 11 years and in that time the         
 congregation has risen steadily. It is
 a busy and varied life. He is rural   
 dean and has to look after other local
 churches if needed. At present this   
 means a lot of extra work as several  
 vicars are missing through illness or 
 moving to other jobs.                 
    There are also the general parish  
 duties - preparing and giving sermons,
 taking services, performing christen- 
 ings, marriages(about 30 a year) and  
 funerals and visiting parishioners.   
 The main service on Sunday is attended
 by over 100 people. Funerals take     
 precedence over other activities.     
 There are groups for Bible studies,   
 young people and mothers. The most    
 enjoyable aspect of the job is meeting
 other people in the community.        </content>
