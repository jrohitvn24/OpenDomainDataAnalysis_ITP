		<title>13Modern Bromsgrove (cont)</title>
		<content> drive through town and look at the    
 shops.Also at night it is very quiet  
 because there are no cars making a    
 noise. Q. Do more people live here    
 than                                  
 when you first moved here?{A.}Yes{Q.} 
 What do you think of that?{A.}It is   
 alright as long as they don't build   
 any more houses.But they should build 
 council houses for young people       
 because private houses are too        
 expensive{Q.}Would you ever move out  
 of Bromsgrove?{A.}Yes,because         
 Bromsgrove is quite boring.
