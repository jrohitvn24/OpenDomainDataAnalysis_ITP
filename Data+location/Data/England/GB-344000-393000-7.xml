		<content>   Here are some of the wild flowers we
 found growing nearby:                 
   {Red and White Campion, Sorrel,     
{Buttercups, Daisies, Dandelions, Cow  
{Parsley}and{Forget-me-nots.}          
                                       
    There are lots of rabbits and the  
 occasional hedgehog to be seen.       
    In addition to common birds such as
 sparrows,thrush,starlings,etc. , there
 can often be seen pheasants from Lord 
 Derby's estate, as well as magpies and
 crows around the farms.In winter we   
 can see flocks of geese flying above. 
    Due to{Eccleston Mere}being very   
 close there are also water birds to be
 seen such as ducks and herons,which   
 are proving a menace to the fish ponds
 in neighbouring gardens.              
    It has also been noticed that      
 seagulls are seen more often around   
 housing estates and school playgrounds</content>
