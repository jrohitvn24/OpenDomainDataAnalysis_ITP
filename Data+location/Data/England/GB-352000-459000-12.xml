An important event is the Clougha Pike 
Amateur Fell Race which attracts over  
100 runners. The adults have to race   
five and a half miles to the top of    
Clougha and back to the sports field   
while for the juniors the distance is  
three miles.                           
      In the evening the adults are    
given a chance to join in. The six a   
side  football final takes place       
followed by  races, pillowfights and   
the tug of war. People come from       
Cumbria to take part in the Cumberland 
and Westmorland wrestling and the      
Quoiting always has its followers.     
This is a very old tradition of        
Quernmore Sports. The competitor has   
to try and throw a metal ring over a   
feather and the winner is the person   
who gets the most quoits over the      
feather.                               </content>
