		<title>03SHAW HEATH POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The Post Office is part of a small    
 shop which at one time was the only   
 shop serving the Shaw Heath area. New 
 shops have been built a little        
 further away but the Post Office has  
 grown with the area.  All the usual   
 transactions can be made, e.g. stamps,
 postal orders, Giro banking, payment  
 of pensions and child benefit. The    
 Post Office section occupies only     
 about one fifth of the floor space,   
 the rest is a general store which has 
 a wide variety of goods. There is a   
 large seletion of food, magazines,    
 greeting cards and household goods.   
 Three women work in the shop. Most of 
 the customers are local people but    
 because the shop is on the main road  
 it does attract casual shoppers.{
