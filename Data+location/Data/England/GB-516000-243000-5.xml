		<content> The Lawns Nursery school caters for   
 3-5 year olds who mostly attend part- 
 time. Competition for places is keen, 
 with names often entered at birth.Full
 time education usually begins at five,
 &amp; the schools catering for this age   
 range are Caldecote Lower school,Upper
 Caldecote, St.Andrews Lower school,   
 Southlands Lower school &amp; Lawnside    
 Lower school, all in Biggleswade, each
 with its own catchment area. At 9+,   
 children usually transfer to middle   
 school, i.e. Edward Peake or Holmemead
 in Biggleswade. Both these establish- 
 ments have several hundred pupils     
 attending at any one time, numbers    
 being inflated by children bussed in  
 from surrounding villages.            
 Broom has no village school &amp; children
 go to Southill &amp; Shefford for their   
 education.
