		<content> Much of the properties lie within the 
{Green Belt}and that population levels 
 are controlled.                       
 Scattered around the countryside are  
 a number of thatched cottages.Within  
 the more urban areas,house development
 is mainly late 19th and early 20th    
 century.                              
 Within the parish of Birchanger there 
 are a number of council houses along- 
 side a new housing estate.            
 The village of Stansted is made up of 
 council and private dwellings forming 
 estates to the east of the village.   
 Leading down towards the centre of the
 village on the south side you find    
 many Victorian properties.            
 The centre of the village is much     
 older and some distinctive houses date
 from{Tudor}times.They stand very proud
 with their oak beams and attract many 
{tourists}during summer months.        </content>
