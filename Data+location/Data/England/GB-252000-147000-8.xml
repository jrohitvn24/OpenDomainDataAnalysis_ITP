		<title>08THE LIFEBOAT STATION</title>
		<content> There has been a lifeboat station     
 since 1828.The present lifeboat is 19 
 years old.There are 10 voluntary crew 
 men,but only 7 go to sea at one time. 
 The life boat station is on the pier, 
 but a tractor has to pull the lifeboat
 300 metres to the slipway.It has to go
 round the street,taking about 10 mins.
 The Ilfracombe lifeboat collects 1500 
 pounds from the public as it is a     
 voluntary organisation.The station is 
 open to the public throughout the     
 year,besides the lifeboat there are   
 lots of interesting photographs and   
 records of rescues.This year the      
 coxwain received a Bronze Medal award 
 for rescuing the yacht Liberty.The    
 Liberty's skipper died of a heart     
 attack,and the other crew member was  
 unable to handle the vessel in        
 difficult conditions.Fortunately,the  
 lifeboat saved the crew member.       </content>
