		<title>18Morecambe Sports Hall</title>
		<content> Morecambe High School was going to get
 a Sports Hall in April 1985 as the    
 Sports Council had promised a grant if
 the City Council would provide some of
 the cost.The City Council decided that
 they would not provide any money.This 
 caused a great discussion especially  
 in the press.Letters and petitions    
 were brought before the council urging
 them to reconsider.So at this point we
 had no Sports Hall and seemed unlikely
 to get one as we were not on the      
 Education Committee's list.After all  
 the public discussion and the refusal 
 of the Council to change their        
 minds,the Education Committee decided 
 to put us top of their list.Even      
 though this new Sports Hall will be   
 smaller than the original,we had      
 managed to win our campaign for a new 
 Sports Hall.
