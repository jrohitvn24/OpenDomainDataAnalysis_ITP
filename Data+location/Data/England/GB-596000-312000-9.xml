		<content> Public Transport in the Dereham area  
 has declined with the increase of more
 cars on the roads. The county bus     
 service has dwindled to approximatey  
 ten buses a day, and also the railway 
 closed in l968, allowing only a few   
 goods trains a day through the town.  
 Consequently, the private car         
 ownership ratio is very high in this  
 area. Private coach services run into 
 town several days a week from outlying
 villages.  School children are also   
 collected from their villages by      
 private bus.                          
 Some people have to rely on a taxi    
 service or Community Bus service to   
 get into town as they have no         
 transport.  Some Old Peoples Clubs in 
 the villages arrange volunteer drivers
 to collect the elderly to bring them  
 into town to collect pensions, do     
 shopping and visit the Doctor.        </content>
