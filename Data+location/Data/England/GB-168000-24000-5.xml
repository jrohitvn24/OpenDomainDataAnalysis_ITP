		<title>05ECOLOGY CORNISH HEDGES</title>
		<content> The Cornish hedge marks the           
 boundaries for fields and roads and is
 made of stone and earth.It is also a  
 distinguishing feature of the         
 landscape.The biggest stones for the  
 foundations are called{grounders.}The 
 width of the base of the hedge is     
 equal to the finished height.The      
 smallest stones are laid in a         
 herringbone pattern known locally as  
{Bill and Bens}or {Jack and Jills.}To  
 finish off,turves or{tobs}are placed  
 for roots to grow down between the    
 stones to hold the hedge together.A   
 Cornish hedger can build up to 4m a   
 dayfor which he gets paid Â£100.The    
 hedge is a living environment for many
 small animals,insects and birds.In    
 spring the hedges are ablaze with     
 colour.Roger Clemens(hedger)says he   
 needs to be a modest man,his skill and
 art are soon clothed in nature.       </content>
