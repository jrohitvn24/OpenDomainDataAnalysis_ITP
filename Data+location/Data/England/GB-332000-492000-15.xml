		<content>    The Grizedale Valley is surrounded 
 by forest. Most of the forest is      
 coniferous trees but there are areas  
 of natural deciduous woodland. The    
 area is rich in wildlife. The most    
 spectacular animal is the {red deer}  
 which is common in Grizedale as is the
{red squirrel.                         
{}                                     
   {The pied flycatcher,}a very local  
 species in Britain, is plentiful in   
 our forest. There is also a bird      
 called the{redstart}which you can     
 recognise by its chestnut tail. The   
{tree pippit}is noticeable for the song
 it sings while gliding. The largest of
 the tit family,{the great tit,}is very
 agile, especially when extracting nuts
 from containers.                      
                                       
    The largest common bird of prey is 
 the{buzzard.}                         </content>
