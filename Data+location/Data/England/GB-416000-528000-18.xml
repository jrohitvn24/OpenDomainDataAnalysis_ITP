		<content> The Roman Catholic Churches of St.    
 Chad, Witton Park and St. Paulinus,   
 West Auckland share the area and the  
 parishoners are widely scattered.  The
 parish primary School of St. Chad's   
 has the family atmosphere of a small  
 village community.  The Churches are  
 active and have a busy calendar with  
 annual Garden Fetes.  Attendance at   
 Sunday Mass is regularly about 261.   
    There were eight Methodist Churches
 in the area for Miners, and Etherley  
 Church for Railwaymen.  Mine closures 
 have resulted in the closing of five  
 of the Churches.  Toft Hill has 26    
 members, Witton park 17, Etherley 43, 
 and Phoenix Row 7, Making Methodist   
 the most popular Church in the area.  
    Nick Beddon, the Vicar of the Saxon
 CHurch, which attracts 10 000 visitors
 a year, says 'The whole world comes to
 Escomb, but the locals don't see it.' </content>
