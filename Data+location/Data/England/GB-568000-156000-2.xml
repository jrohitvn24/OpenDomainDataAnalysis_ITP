		<content> Progressive Ditton had its first C of 
 E school in 1853. An Infants' School  
 (now housing a swimming pool) was     
 built in 1894. These two Victorian    
 buildings coped with the school       
 population until 1953 when two        
 temporary timber classrooms were      
 erected. The pressing need for extra  
 school places came with the housing   
 boom of the 1950's and 60's. Building 
 started in 1958. By 1972, 12 new      
 classrooms plus several in the        
 original Victorian building, were in  
 use. Such was the demand for school   
 places that a separate Infants' school
 was opened in 1973. Within 10 years,  
 the school roll was falling. Today,   
 some classrooms stand empty and       
 teachers have been redeployed. The    
 original school building has been     
 converted into Ditton Church Centre.
