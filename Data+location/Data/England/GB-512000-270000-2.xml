 Club is Mrs B. Croft.The previous     
 leader was Mrs V.Brown who was leader 
 for 25 years.In the club there are    
 about 30 members and they go on       
 approximately 2 coach trips a year.For
 the trips,they go to places like      
 historic houses and shopping centres. 
 At club meetings,they play dominoes,  
 whist and drink tea.They meet about   
 once a month.The average age in the   
 club is 68-70.The club is not really  
 involved with the church,although many

 of club for the elderly,which is      
 called the Over 60's club.The club    
 meetings are held in the Ellington    
 Village Hall,and the leader is Mrs
