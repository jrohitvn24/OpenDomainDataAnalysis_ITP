		<content>   West Wood is{ancient woodland       
 managed by Cistercian Monks 1210-1530.
 Used for site of military instalations
 (anti-aircraft guns)in World War 2 and
 then fell into neglect and sold into  
 lots in 1948.Owned by Hants.C.C.      
 Eastleigh Boro.Co. Soton City Co. and 
 sundry private owners it was used for 
 gravel extraction and subsequently    
 rubbish tipping and it became a messy 
 eyesore.                              
   In 1981 local residents took        
 interest in its preservation and a    
 group called{"Friends of West Wood"   
 was founded.To date 600 man hours have
 been spent clearing rubbish (34 old   
 cars)and tree planting etc.Help given 
 by Venture scouts,local schools,Guides
 and many other groups.Council gave    
 skips,posts,cement etc.and the site is
 once again becoming a place to enjoy.
