		<title>09BRIGG'S FIREMEN</title>
		<content> All firemen in Brigg are part_time.   
 They must live within five miles of   
 the fire station, be at least l.73    
 metres tall, have a 96 centimetres    
 chest and be physically fit.          
 All firemen carry an alerter.         
 A maximum of six men and a minimum of 
 three men can ride at once on the     
 fire engine.                          
 The fire engine at Brigg is a Dennis  
 model which carries a l3.5 metre      
 ladder, twenty lengths of hose and    
 2,5OO litres of water.  The firemen   
 must have an H.G.V. Class 3 licence to
 be able to drive the engine.          
 Firemen have to learn to wear         
 breathing apparatus to enable them to 
 breath in smoke filled buildings.     
 They also have to rescue people who   
 are trapped.
