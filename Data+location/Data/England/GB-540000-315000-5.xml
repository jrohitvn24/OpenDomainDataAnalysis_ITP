		<title>05TYDD ST. GILES - DRAINAGE</title>
		<content> The Fens were always marshy.In winter 
 the rivers overflowed so drains were  
 badly needed.The fens were divided    
 into The North Level, The Middle Level
 and the South Level.They are called   
 the Bedford Levels.The North Level    
 Main Drain flows through our parish.  
    It was dug in 1834: it is 23       
 metres wide and was dug by hand using 
 wheelbarrows,not modern machinery.    
 There was a large army of workers,    
 mostly from Ireland.They lived in     
 camps,and the village must have seen  
 much excitement while they were here. 
    The Drain cut across roads.It is   
 this drain which carries the water    
 from most of the fens in the north of 
 this county,as well as those in parts 
 of Lincolnshire,safely to the sea.
