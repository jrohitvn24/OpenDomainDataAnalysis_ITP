		<title>10THE SHOOTING BOX</title>
		<content>   On the top of the{Long Mynd}is a    
 building called the{Shooting Box.     
   The roof is made of corrugated      
 iron.One side of the box is made of   
 brick the other side is underground so
 you cannot see it.It has one door and 
 one room with a roof dropped on       
 it.Inside it was dark.                
   The Government was not happy because
 the{Shooting Box }was built in an old 
 burial ground in a small hill which   
 was the site of a{Tumulus}.           
   The box is used as a base for       
 shooting Grouse,a popular{game bird.} 
 We think it was built into the side of
 the{Tumulus}for camouflage;all you can
 see is the roof.                      
   The{beaters}would drive the birds   
 to the box where the shooters would be
 waiting.                              
                                       
                                       </content>
