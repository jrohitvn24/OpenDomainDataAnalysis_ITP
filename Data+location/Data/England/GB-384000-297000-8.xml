During the reign of King William the   
Domesday Book of 1086 recorded the fact
that Perton was called 'Pertone' and   
measured some three hides being held of
Westminster Abbey. The settlement      
called Pertone was situated in the     
Seisdon Hundred in South Staffordshire.
   The name Perton is thought to  come 
from the fact that a long time ago part
of the area was covered in orchards. It
is because of this that the settlement 
got the name Pear-Town ot Perton. Today
in nearby Tettenhall you can still come
across Pear orchards.
