		<title>13A Slindon Ghost Story.</title>
		<content> At Slindon College there is a story   
 told of the ghost of Lady Beaumont,   
 after whom one of the dormitories is  
 named. It is told on cold,dark nights.
 "One night, I was asleep in my dorm., 
 when I awoke with a start. There,at   
 the bottom of my bed was a shadowy    
 figure. I thought that it was Matron, 
 doing her night rounds, and when she  
 beckoned to me,I followed without a   
 second thought.She slowly drifted     
 along the corridor outside the dorm. I
 followed a few paces behind. Suddenly 
 she turned, and it was then I realised
 that she had no face! She advanced    
 menacingly towards me and I stood     
 rooted to the spot.She came closer and
 closer,__then passed straight through 
 me, leaving only a chill feeling and a
 stench of death.I awoke my friends and
 was told I had met the Ghost of Lady  
 Beaumont." (This is not a true story!)</content>
