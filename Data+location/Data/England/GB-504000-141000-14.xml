		<content> DIALECT:  Surrey settled by Saxons and
 South Saxon has influenced place      
 names.  Today most local people are   
 in-comers and have been moving in     
 since the middle of the 19th Century  
 so that little dialect remains        
 traceable.  However, place names still
 reveal origins as follows:            
 Pitch Hill = Short Steep slope        
 Coneyhurst = Rabbit wood (rabbits     
 brought in by the Normans.)           
 Ewhurst = Yew Wood                    
 Hurtwood = Hurts are billberries      
 Farley = bracken clearing             
 Barn Platt = small plot with barn     
 Dewdney's well = owned by John Dewdney
 Kill Copse = Kiln Copse               
 Stroude Common = strode or a marsh    
 Willinghurst = Willa's stubble land   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
