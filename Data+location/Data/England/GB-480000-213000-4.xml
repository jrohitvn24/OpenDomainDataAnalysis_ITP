		<title>04LOCAL HISTORY OF AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>An archaeological excavation is        
currently being carried out in         
Prebendal Court,Aylesbury.They have    
found a defensive ditch from the Iron  
Age and Aylesbury is therefore sited   
inside a large previously unknown      
hillfort.Storage pits have been found  
and the existence of this hillfort     
provides the Bury part of Aylesbury.   
Another boundary ditch from Saxon times
has also been found and the people who 
dug the ditch probably knew of "Aegil" 
the Saxon whose name forms the first   
part of Aylesbury.                     
The first church in Aylesbury probably 
comes from Saxon times and lies beneath
St.Mary's.                             
The evidence of Medieval times is shown
in the wells and cess pits which have  
been excavated.In later periods houses 
were built along this site which       
destroyed earlier levels.              </content>
