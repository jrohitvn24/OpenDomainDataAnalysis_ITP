		<title>17Transport in Itchenor area</title>
		<content>  Since there are no shops in this area
 transport is vital. However the bus   
 service to and from Itchenor village  
 only runs once on Tuesday mornings and
 twice on Saturday in the morning and  
 just after noon.                      
  Along the main road to W.Wittering   
 the buses run once every hour in each 
 direction, though on Sundays only     
 every two hours.                      
  State school children are provided   
 for by school buses.                  
  The nearest railway station is at    
 Chichester.                           
  Since public transport is so meagre, 
 nearly every household in the area    
 has at least one car.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
