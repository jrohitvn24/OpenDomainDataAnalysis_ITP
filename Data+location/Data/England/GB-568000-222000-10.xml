		<title>10  GRAUNT COURTS</title>
		<content>   Commander McDonald-Hall has lived at
 Graunt Courts since 1975. It is a very
 large and expensive house.            
   There has been a house there since  
 1556. The name Graunt Courts has      
 french origins.                       
   Many years ago monks used to stop   
 there on pilgramages. In return for   
 bed and food they did jobs around the 
 house and garden. Some of the monks   
 painted pictures on the walls and     
 ceilings at Graunt Courts.            
   When the Commander first came to    
 Graunt Courts there was a restless    
 spirit that haunted the house. So a   
 vicar came to bless all the rooms.    
   The Commander owns an Aerospace     
 Company which makes fittings for      
 aeroplanes. He has a helicopter which 
 he uses for work and pleasure. He also
 has 4 vintage cars. He has made many  
 improvements to the house.            </content>
