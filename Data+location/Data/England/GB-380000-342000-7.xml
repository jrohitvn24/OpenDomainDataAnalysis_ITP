		<content>Things about school 60years ago.       
All the desks were wooden ones with    
hinged seats.Writing was done with pen 
and real ink from an ink well in the   
desk.You could leave school at aged 14 
years.Lessons were nearly the same as  
ours but Maths was called Arithmetic,  
girls learned needlework and in some   
Junior schools boys did gardening.PE.  
was called P.T.(Physical Training) and 
girls had to wear black gymstockings,  
black gymslips and white blouse.Boys   
had to wear shorts and a white singlet 
(vest).Boys usually played football and
cricket and girls played rounders.There
were no swimming lessonsn then.If you  
were naughty you might get the cane off
the teacher,so you had to be good.     
Playground games were skipping,Top and 
Whip,Hopscotch and only boys played    
marbles.
