		<content>Watch is a wildlife organisation for   
young people.It is the younger version 
of the Adults'B.B.O.N.T.It aims to save
wildlife and plants from becoming      
extint.Our group started in 1983.      
The Slade is our nature reserve.It is  
special as it is the only one in Brit- 
ain owned by a Watch group.The 3 acre  
site is divided into a watermeadow,an  
old railway line and an Alderwood with 
a stream.All that is left of the old   
railway line is a long grassy embank-  
ment.In the future we hope to buy anot-
her length of line to add to the reser-
ve.In the watermeadow there are Common 
Spotted Orchids and Ragged Robin both  
rare plants.On the North Margin there  
are pollarded willows.Two were danger- 
ous so had to be cut down.On the South 
edge is a natural hedge which birds ne-
st in.The meadow is cut annually,but we
have left a patch uncut as a control.  </content>
