		<title>08Play Group</title>
		<content> The play group is held to help        
 pre-school children to meet and mix   
 with each other. It is for children   
 between 2 to 3 years old and school   
 age.                                  
     The play group belongs to a       
 national organisation for play groups 
 and receives a grant at the end of    
 each tax year.                        
               Most funds are raised by
 village functions.                    
                   24 children attend  
 for 4 mornings each week.             
                          There is a   
 mothers and toddlers meeting each     
 Thursday morning.                     
                  This organisation    
 enables mothers at home with young    
 children to meet.                     
                  The meetings take    
 place in the Methodist Community Hall.
