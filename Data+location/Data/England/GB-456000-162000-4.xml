		<title>04ECOLOGY OF THE TADLEY AREA 2</title>
		<content> Ancient woodlands are sites known to  
 have had trees on them for at least   
 300 years, they are rich in wildlife  
 and recently both Berkshire and       
 Hampshire County Councils have been   
 compiling Inventories. Among the      
 ancient woodlands of the Tadley area  
 are Inwood Copse, Chaplin's Wood,     
 Redlands Wood and Wasing Wood which is
 notified by the Nature Conservancy    
 Council as an SSSI (Site of Special   
 Scientific Interest) because of its   
 importance for dragonflies. Ashford   
 Hill Meadows are superb examples of   
 traditionally managed hay and grazing 
 meadows, now very rare and extremely  
 rich in plant species, surrounded by  
 ancient woodlands rich in insect life.
 Because of their importance to nature 
 conservation they are shortly to be   
 declared as a National Nature Reserve 
 by the Nature Conservancy Council.    </content>
