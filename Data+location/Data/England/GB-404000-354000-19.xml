		<title>19The little ball of .....?</title>
		<content>     They were left all alone in a ball
of hay in a shed.  We'd always kept an 
eye on them, even when their mother had
gone, but they didn't know.  Then one  
day we saw that they were really cold, 
and brought them down to home.  Under a
lamp I put them, in their own little   
tin box.  They squealed and squeaked   
and I said, "Please stop," because my  
eyes filled up with tears.             
     Then I thought, "What about food?"
They'd had nothing to eat all day.  But
after I'd fed them I thought, "How come
there's only 2?"  There had been 3 but 
now .....  My mind just stopped.  My   
eyes filled up, and I asked my mum when
she walked in.  I felt so .....funny,  
that I began to cry and tears rolled   
down my face.                          
     But my hedgehogs are still here   
today.
