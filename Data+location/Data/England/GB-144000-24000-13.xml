		<title>13Recreation (2) in Mousehole</title>
		<content>     As well as the things mentioned   
 under{Recreation (1)}there are a      
 number of other clubs.  Some of these 
 are also associated with the{St.      
{Clements Methodist Chapel}such as the 
{Young Wives}group and the{Ladies      
{Sewing Guild.} These all use the      
 Sunday School room for their meetings 
 which as there is no village hall     
 serves this purpose for many events   
 not held on a regular basis.          
     Another user of this room is the  
{Mousehole Male Voice Choir}which made 
 its first radio broadcast as far back 
 a 1932 and since then over one hundred
 more.  In 1956 it also became the     
 first{Cornish}male voice choir to     
 appear on television.  The choir has  
 been very successful in many contests 
 and has many engagements which take   
 them all over the country as well as  
 the regular local performances.       </content>
