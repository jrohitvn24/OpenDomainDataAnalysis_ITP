		<content> need quite alot of protection. This   
 protection is boots with steel toe    
 caps, wellingtons with steel toe caps,
 two overalls, safety helmets, face    
 masks, and ear muffs.  The work hours 
 for the quarry are 7am to 5pm and the 
 work hours for truck drivers are 6am  
 to 6pm.                               
      At the quarry animals from the   
 nearby countryside have been seen     
 running about.  Also footprints and   
 bodies of dead animals have been      
 found.  The animals are mainly foxes  
 and muntjacks (small deer).  Also     
 there is said to be a wild mink that  
 runs around the Elsenham Quarry.      
      The quarry was first owned by Mr 
 S A Facey and then it was owned by a  
 company called Knights.  In 1985 it   
 was acquired by a company called      
 Greenhams.
