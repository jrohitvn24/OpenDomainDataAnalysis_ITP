		<content>        Shops in Harrold.              
 There are four shops selling grocery  
 and general requirements.Two of these 
 shops are situated near The Green and 
 we conducted surveys outside these two
 shops.                                
 In our survey we asked how often      
 people shopped at that particular     
 shop,whether they did all their       
 shopping in the village or if they    
 went to a nearby town &lt;Bedford or     
 Northampton>.Our results are as       
 follows:                              
 Pax Stores:-A grocery shop which sells
 many kinds of general goods, sweets,  
 cigarettes, etc.                      
 2O people surveyed,6 shopped regularly
 once a week and the others "popped    
 in"more than once a week for the odd  
 things which they had forgotten to    
 buy.
