		<title>02CAMPTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content> In Campton there is a shop and post   
 office, a pub, a village hall, a      
 village school and a church. There    
 used to be two pubs in Campton but one
 closed a couple of years ago and now  
 only The White Hart is left.          
     There is little industry in       
 Campton but there is some market      
 gardening.There is a small jewelry    
 making business and a light aircraft  
 busines. There is also a factory which
 makes clay pigeons.                   
     The Village Hall is one of the    
 main points of the village. It's      
 single Bedfordshire brick walls are   
 crumbling with age. The reed thatched 
 roof was top trimmed and revived in   
 1975 and in 1980 an extension and new 
 toilets were built.                   
     The River Hit runs all the way    
 through Campton.
