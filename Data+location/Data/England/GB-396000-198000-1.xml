		<content>{THE ORIGIN OF COTSWOLD?}              
   THE NAME OF COATES OR 'DE COTES'    
 FIRST APPEARED IN THE RECORDS OF 1201.
 THE MANORS OF ACHELIE, LISTED IN THE  
 DOMESDAY SURVEY 0F 1086, WERE KNOWN AS
 THE COTES MANORS AND WERE SHEEP FARMS 
 OR CLEARINGS.IN THE 15TH CENTURY      
 'COTTESWOLDE'IS FOUND IN THE RECORDS  
 AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE  
 THE DERIVATION OF THE MODERN COTSWOLD.
 SHEEP STILL GRAZE IN THE FIELDS.      
                                       
{THE DESERTED VILLAGE.}                
   HULLASEY, ALSO MENTIONED IN THE     
 DOMESDAY SURVEY, WAS DESERTED. AN     
 EXCAVATION OF THE SITE WAS MADE IN    
 1907 AND A FURTHER SURVEY IN 1982.    
 IT IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DESERTED IN
 THE 15TH CENTURY DUE TO AN EPIDEMIC.  
 YOUNG TREES HAVE NOW BEEN PLANTED     
 THERE.
