		<content> The area we have studied is the North 
 Eastern part of{St. Albans.}It is a   
 very "mixed" area.                    
 The area round our school is mainly   
{residential. }The houses are 25 years 
 old and are considered to be large    
 with plenty of land. To the east is   
 the Jersey Farm estate, a newly built 
 estate which caused controversy       
 initially because it is built on the  
 Green Belt. Further east again is{soft
{rolling countryside.}                 
 The southern part of our area is a    
 mixture of older residential houses,  
 late 19th century and early 20th      
 century, and{small industrial estates.
 Because of the variety it has been an 
 interesting area to study and we have 
 enjoyed doing it very much. We enjoyed
 going out and finding things out for  
 ourselves.
