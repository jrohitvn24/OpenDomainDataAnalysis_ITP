		<content> Living in the country today is totally
 different from even forty years ago.  
 Until then, cars on the road were not 
 many, scince few could afford to buy  
 one; and the railway system was       
 widespread, covering most small towns 
 and even remote villages, with        
 stations about 15 -20 miles apart,    
 making travel possible, and cheap,    
 ifat times slow.  Now there are few   
 rural railway stations.               
 The coming of the mass-produced       
 motor-car has brought with it many    
 miles of motorway, linked by lesser   
 roads, taking over from travel by     
 canal or coastal shipping, and even by
 rail.  Domestic airways compete with  
 motorways between major cities. All   
 have a great bearing on country living
 today both from the point of view easy
 access and increased noise.
