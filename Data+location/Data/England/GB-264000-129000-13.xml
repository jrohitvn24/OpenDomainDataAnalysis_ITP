		<title>13A German Girl's View</title>
		<content> Anne is 16 years old.Her parents are  
 doctors.She came to West Buckland     
 School to learn English.She finds many
 differences between North Devon and   
 Germany.The weather better in         
 Germany.The humour is better in       
 England.The attitude to school is not 
 so serious and Anne likes this.The    
 food is generally better in           
 Germany.She certainly does not like   
 school meals here.Chocolate and meat  
 are very much nicer in her home town. 
 Anne has been in England almost a year
 and likes boarding at West Buckland   
 School and she has learnt alot about  
 English life.                         
 Anne's hobbies are                    
 music,swimming,knitting,ballet,choir  
 and skiing.
