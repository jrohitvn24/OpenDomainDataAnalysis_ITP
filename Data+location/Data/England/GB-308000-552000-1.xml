		<content> Two thirds of our area is sea  and one
 third is land.   Most of the land area
 is open spaces. The main settlement is
{Silloth, }which  has a  population  of
 2,789   including  {Skinburness   }and
{Blitterlees.} Silloth  was first built
 in the 1850's round a dock and railway
 which ran from {Carlisle. }The railway
 is  now  closed  but  the  dock  still
 operates.  Silloth streets are set out
 like  a  gridiron pattern and they are
 named  after  geographical  features -
 rivers and mountains, etc.  There is a
 large Green and a long Promenade which
 runs up to Skinburness Village  to the
 North.  To the  South is{ West Silloth
 which is mostly a council estate - The
 Crofts.  The rest of the area is  open
 land  and  farms  except  for  several
 small  settlements  like {Blitterlees,
{Causewayhead}etc.
