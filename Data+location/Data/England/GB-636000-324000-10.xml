		<content> where as 20 years ago, the timetable  
 would have been rigid and lessons set 
 for certain times. It was the an      
 infant and Junior School combined.    
 20 years ago, everyone brought        
 cold dinners to school or went home.  
 Today 35 have school diners and 98    
 have their own packed lunch.          
 Since 1980 when the Middle School     
 opened, taking the older children, the
 age range has been from 4+ to 8+.     
 The original School building was      
 opened 1878.10 years ago another small
 block was built. School uniforms were 
 once worn but are no longer considered
 to be compulsery. Other changes in the
 last 20 years have been the way       
 classrooms are used, and the growth of
 ancilliary workers:3 supervisor       
 /assistants,1 dinner lady 1 patrol    
 crossing lady,1 cleaner/caretaker 1   
 secretary &amp; 1 welfare assistant.      </content>
