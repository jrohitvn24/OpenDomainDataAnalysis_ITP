		<content> My name is Alaxandra Bateman.  I live 
 in a village in Lincolnshire.  My     
 mother is a post lady.  She gets up at
 six thirty to sort the mail and comes 
 back at seven thirty to have breakfast
 and get us off to school.  At eight   
 thirty she delivers the mail.         
   My father works in London and comes 
 home at the weekends.  Our house      
 is up for sale.  When it is sold we   
 are moving down to Kent.  My brother  
 Andrew is 16 years old and goes to    
 school in Gainsbrough, he takes 11    
 in shoes.  My sister Adele is 14 years
 old.  She has a paper round in the    
 village.  Her favourite group is WHAM!
   I am 11 years old. I rise at seven  
 thirty and go to school at eight      
 thirty.  I go to school on my bicycle 
 and get back at three-thirty. I go to 
 bed at nine-thirty.  I play the Piano.
