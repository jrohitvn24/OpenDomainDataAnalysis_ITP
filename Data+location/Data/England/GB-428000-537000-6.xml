		<content> In our area we have one Post Office.It
 is quite near to the Hare and         
 Greyhound.The Post Office has         
 confectioners counter where sweets are
 sold and there is a bank.It is only a 
 small bank and there aren't many      
 people in it.There are stamps for sale
 and there is a post box in an outside 
 wall.The Post Office is also used for 
 withdrawing pensions on Thursdays.Just
 recently our Post Office has swapped  
 over with John and Dorothy            
{Hopper.Mrs.Haigh and Mrs.Ozbaldesdon  
 deliver the post to people that live  
 in Bowburn.The Post Office is over the
 road from the Industrial Estate.The   
 road is the A177 that leads into      
 Durham.
