		<content>There is one Council estate in         
Horsmonden which is Gibbet Lane and    
Orchard Close , built in the 1940s.    
The Orchard estate is mainly three and 
four bedroomed detached, owner-occupied
houses built in the early 1960s.       
However at the West end of Orchard     
Crescent there are some Council houses 
&amp; flats. Fromandez Drive and Angley    
Court are estates of privately-owned,  
detached or semi-detached bungalows.   
There are terraces of four small       
houses in Maidstone Road, Goudhurst    
Road and Lamberhurst Road. Practically 
every home in Horsmonden has a garden, 
some of them very large. Many people   
grow their own vegetables like runner- 
beans, carrots, potatoes and salad     
crops. Homes are heated by electricity,
oil or solid fuel.  There is no gas in 
Horsmonden except calor gas.
