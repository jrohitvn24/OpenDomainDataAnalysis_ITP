		<title>06LOCHE PARK</title>
		<content> The employees of Loche Park get paid  
 between Â£70 and Â£100 a week on        
 average,but this includes bonuses.    
    The park will probably stay open   
 indefinately.                         
    The Park is locked up at 10pm and  
 there is a patrol man who keeps every 
 thing in order,but he finishes work   
 also at 10pm.                         
    There is a lot of vandalism,mostly 
 done by school children,but adults    
 steal the plants.Boats are vandalised 
 and a few people involved and         
 prosecuted.                           
    Every week the grass is cut,the    
 grounds are swept,the gardens are     
 weeded and the lawns are edged.       
    There is no profit made by the     
 park.The council finances the Park    
 with rates.                           
    The boats make about Â£2_300 a week 
 in the Summer.                        </content>
