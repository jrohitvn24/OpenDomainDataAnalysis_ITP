		<content> A large part of the area is mainly    
 used for farming.The farmland is      
 divided into two sections by the      
 A20.To the north of this main road are
 the North Downs which are made of     
 chalk,which influences the soil and   
 hence the type of farming that takes  
 place on this land.Along the North    
 Downs there are large fields &lt;due to  
 the fences having been taken down> of 
 cereal crops e.g.wheat and barley.the 
 land is also used for grazing         
 purposes.Large areas of land are used 
 for rearing sheep.                    
      The two farms north of the A20   
 are called Little Pivington and Great 
 Pivington.Some of the farm buildings  
 are now ruins and part of Little      
 Pivington is now being used by        
 Maidstone Coachworks.                 
      South of the A20 the soil is     
 influenced by clay and chalk.         </content>
