		<content>  The{transport}services in and around 
 Tadcaster are very good, especially   
 for the{old people}who use buses and  
 taxis to travel in. The buses to and  
 from Tadcaster Grammar School are very
 unreliable. They often do not turn up 
 to take us home which means we have to
 telephone our mothers to come and     
 fetch us in the car.                  
 Most{teenagers}from the age of sixteen
 have a 50cc{moped.}The most popular   
 mopeds are Suzukis and Kawasakis.     
 These are extremely economical on     
 petrol as they do about 70 miles to   
 the gallon. The cost of these mopeds  
 brand new is about six hundred pounds.
