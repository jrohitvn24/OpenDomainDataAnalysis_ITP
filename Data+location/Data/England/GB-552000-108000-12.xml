		<title>12Michelham Priory.</title>
		<content>   Michelham Priory was built in 1229  
 by Gilbert de Aquila,a Norman lord who
 obtained permission from King Henry   
 V111 to found an Augustinian monastery
 During the Peasants Revolt of 1381,the
 gatehouse and drawbridge were built to
 ward off attacks.About 1400 the great 
 moat was dug within an existing bend  
 of the River Cuckmere.Henry V111      
 dissolved the monastery in 1536 and   
 most of its silver,ornaments etc.were 
 sold off.Michelham then passed through
 a great many hands until Mr.Wright    
 purchased it in 1923.He completely    
 restored it but unfortunately a very  
 bad fire damaged the Tudor wing in    
 1927.During the war Michelham was     
 occupied by the army and many high    
 level conferences took place          
 concerning "D"day.The Priory is now   
 owned by the Sussex Archaeological    
 trust who open it to the public       </content>
