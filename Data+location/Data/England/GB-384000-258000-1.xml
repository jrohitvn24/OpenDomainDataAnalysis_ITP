		<content> The block covers an area lying to the 
 north of the City of Worcester. Part  
 of the area lies within the City      
 boundary. The majority of the block   
 lies within the ecclesiastical parish 
 of Claines. The origin of the name    
 'Claines' is thought to have referred 
 to the clay lanes at the junction of  
 which the Parish Church stands. At one
 time, the ecclesiastical parish       
 emcompassed a large area, right down  
 to The Cross in the centre of         
 Worcester. The land usage is mainly   
 agricultural although there are       
 sizeable areas of quite high density  
 housing, serving the nearby City.
