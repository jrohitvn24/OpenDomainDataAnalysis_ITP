		<content> On the last day of school we were     
 ready to go to Kent. Mrs Ogburn came  
 for us and we went to Salisbury to    
 wait for the driver of the Victoria   
 coach. In the coach I fell asleep and 
 had to be woken up. Then we went to   
 Strood on the coach from Victoria.    
 From there we caught the bus from     
 Strood to Allhallows. When we arrived 
 we sat down and looked at the         
 decorations. We had a long wait till  
 Christmas day. When it came we opened 
 the presents. I had a jumper, two     
 dresses, pillow cases, quilt,         
 curtains, pencil case, personal hi-fi,
 barbie doll, charm bracelet, two      
 charms, a fairy castle, a grand piano 
 box, shoes, purse, scarf, earrings,   
 pen, teddy, tape, nightie, pyjamas,   
 rucksack, soap, talc, bath cube set,  
 necklace, watch, a tangerine, and     
 sweets galore.                        </content>
