		<content>{Thomas Jones writes -}I live in       
 Rookley and the church I go to is St. 
 Olave's, our{13th C. Parish Church}at 
 Gatcombe. The church is small and     
 peaceful, with bright kneelers and    
 lovely flowers. There is a wooden     
 effigy of a knight crusader in the    
 Sanctury and the stained glass windows
 were painted by the Pre-Raphaelites.  
                                       
 About 20 of us go the{Sunday School.  
 Once a month we go to Family Service. 
 Both Chillerton and Rookley have Meth-
 odist Chapels which have Sunday       
 Schools too. There is a lot or unity  
 and support for each others special   
 occasions and services.  We enjoy     
 decorating the Church for Harvest     
 Festival and for Christmas and Easter.
 As Rookley has no C. of E. Church     
 worshippers have to go to Gatcombe or 
 to Godshill or Arreton.               </content>
