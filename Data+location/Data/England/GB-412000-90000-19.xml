		<title>19GROYNES ON BOURNEMOUTH BEACH</title>
		<content>   ON SOUTHBOURNE BEACH THE COUNCIL ARE
 PUTTING IN NEW GROYNES TO STOP THE SEA
 COMING IN TOO HIGH AND FLOODING THE   
 BEACH HUTS.  THE SAND IS ALL PILED UP 
 IN A HEAP BECAUSE THE CURRENT IS      
 PULLING IT ALONG.  WHEN THE WAVES COME
 IN THEY BRING MORE SAND WITH THEM SO  
 IT PILES UP HIGH AND THE SEA CAN'T GET
 OVER THE TOP.  WHEN THE WATER COMES   
 THE SAND CRUMBLES AWAY BUT ON THE NEXT
 WAVE IT BRINGS ANOTHER LOT OF SAND.   
 THE GROYNE STOPS THE SAND FROM BEING  
 CARRIED AWAY.  IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A    
 GROYNE THE BEACH WOULD DISAPPEAR AND  
 THE BEACH HUTS WOULD BE IN DANGER FROM
 THE SEA.                              
   THE CLIFFS AT SOUTHBOURNE ARE VERY  
 SOFT AND CRUMBLY.  DURING WINTER      
 STORMS THEY SOMETIMES COLLAPSE AND    
 DESTROY SOME OF THE BEACH HUTS.
