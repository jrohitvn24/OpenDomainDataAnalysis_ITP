		<content> The{Capon Tree Stone}marks the site of
 the Capon Tree, from whose branches,  
 on October the 21st, 1746ad were hung 
 six local men for their active        
 adherence to the cause of the Royal   
 Line of Stewart. The original Capon   
 Tree was a large Oak growing on common
 land, half a mile from Brampton on the
 old Carlisle-Newcastle road. The name 
 is thought to originate from the fact 
 that circuit judges, riding on        
 horseback from Newcastle to Carlisle  
 with their attendant barristers,      
 attorneys, clerks, servants and armed 
 escort used this site to stop for rest
 and refreshment. Many were corrupt and
 accepted bribes of fat chickens and   
 wine from the local people. They were 
 known as 'Capon Justices'.            
 The{Written stone of Gelt}shows       
 indecipherable markings which are     
 thought to date from Roman times.     </content>
