		<title>05WILDLIFE ON THE RIVER CALDEW</title>
		<content>{FISH:}The main type of fish found in  
 the River Caldew is trout. There used 
 to be salmon but because of weirs     
 they cannot get up the river to breed.
 The North West Water Board is hoping  
 to rectify this.                      
{BIRDS:}At Bridge End there is a heron 
 and a few ducks. A kingfisher is known
 to be in this area too.               
{PLANTS:}The banks of the river are    
 overgrown with plants. Trees there    
 include willow (nearest the water),   
 rowan trees and elderberry bushes (the
 berries of the two plants are often   
 used for wine), birch and elm.        
{ANIMALS:}Otters have been seen.       
{CONSERVATION:}Near Gatesgill where Roe
 Beck joins the Caldew a conservation  
 area is planned. At present it is an  
 ox-bow lake. This will be fenced and a
 sluice gate fitted at one end. It will
 be flooded and ducks introduced.      </content>
