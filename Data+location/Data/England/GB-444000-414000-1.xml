		<content> Landscape Badsworth village           
                                       
 Badsworth is a small and very peaceful
 village with few amenities.It has a   
 small primary school, a doctor's      
 surgery,78 Club for adults,a sewage   
 works out side Badsworth, a chapel and
 a church, and two bus services with   
 the 485 to Wakefield and 246 to       
 Pontefract.There used to be a Post    
 Office.Badsworth is situated between  
 Thorpe Audlin and Ackworth in West    
 Yorkshire.                            
 In 1977 Badsworth came second in the  
 best kept village competition.Farming 
 is the only industry.                 
 I think it is nice and quiet but I    
 think it is not for younger people,it 
 is mostly for older retired people.
