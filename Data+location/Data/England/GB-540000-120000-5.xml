		<title>05THE CHURCH TODAY IN NEWICK</title>
		<content> The Church realises its importance in 
 a small, village community. It        
 provides a sense of continuity and    
 stability in an ever-changing world.  
 Talking to the Deaconess made us      
 realise that everyone in the village  
 needs the church to be there _ even   
 though they themselves do not take an 
 active part in its life. The Church   
 has tried to keep a balance of        
 tradition for the older parishioners, 
 and new ideas to attract the young    
 people.                               
    The Parish Church has tried to     
 forge links between other religious   
 groups, with varying degrees of       
 success. Some refuse to find any      
 common ground whereas the Catholics,  
 with no hall of their own, borrow the 
 Parish one, which makes for frequent, 
 healthy contact.
