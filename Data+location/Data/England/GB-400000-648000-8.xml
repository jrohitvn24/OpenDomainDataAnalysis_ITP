		<title>08Farming,Farms, Scremerston.</title>
		<content> There are two farms in Scremerston and
 both are the{arable}type growing crops
 of{wheat}and{barley.                  
     One is called Borewell Farm and   
 the other is called Inland Pastures   
 Farm.                                 
     The grass is used for{silage}and  
 grazed by{cattle}and{sheep.           
     Many years ago there would have   
 been a lot of workers on each farm but
 today they are managed by very few    
 farm workers.Horses would have been   
 used to do most of the work but now   
 tractors are used for ploughing and   
 most of the other jobs on the farms.  
      The{farm cottages}are not all    
 used by the farmworkers and some are  
 let as holiday cottages or as         
 permanent houses for private          
 individuals.
