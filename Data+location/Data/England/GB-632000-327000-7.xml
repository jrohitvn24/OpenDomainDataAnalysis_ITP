		<title>07THATCHING IN HONING</title>
		<content> Buffham's Farm, a listed building on  
 the Honing Estate, is being renovated 
 and re-thatched. On February 8th. we  
 walked to the farm to meet the        
 thatcher. On a bitterly cold day he   
 showed us some of his tools in a small
 haybarn close to the house- the leggat
 that neatens the overhang and pushes  
 the reeds firmly down, his knives for 
 cutting reeds and sedge, and his      
 protective leather knee pads. The reed
 comes from St. Olaves, and the sedge  
 from Catfield a few miles away. We saw
 him use liggers and brotches. The     
 sedge is used for the ridge of the    
 roof. His company employs three       
 elderly thatchers only. They have no  
 apprentices learning the art so when  
 the three of them retire the company  
 will cease to exist. Few thatched     
 roofs remain, those that do are often 
 the subject of preservation orders.   </content>
