		<title>14The Topp, Alston Moor</title>
		<content> The building known as The Topp has    
 been used as a kind of{community      
{centre}for ten years.  It used to be a
 school and still belongs to{Cumbria   
{County Council.} To rent The Topp an  
 organisation has to agree to pay a    
 small fee and there are restrictions  
 on who may use it.  The repairs and   
 upkeep of the building are the        
 responsability of the County Council  
 and a cleaner is paid by them.  They  
 also pay for the heating and lighting.
 The headteacher of Samuel King's      
 School is in charge of the Topp.
