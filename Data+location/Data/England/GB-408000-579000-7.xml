		<content> Of the 31 houses in this block only 2 
 do  not have a telephone installed.   
 There is one public telephone at Bolam
 Country Park.                         
 Nearly everyone has access to         
 television and watched it regularly   
 for news and entertainment.           
 Most homes take a daily newspaper     
 either national, local or both. There 
 is a daily newspaper delivery service 
 operated from the Post Office and     
 Newsagent at Belsay.                  
 The Post is delivered to each house   
 daily and there are two collections   
 daily from the Post Office in Belsay. 
 The County Council provide a mobile   
 library service to many homes as      
 requested.
