		<title>19Meltham Mills and Co-op</title>
		<content>   { Meltham}grew up around the{woollen
{mills}because the water ran over the  
 peat on the moors . At one time in    
 the{1800's}there were{woollen mills,  
{cotton mills}and{silk mills}in        
{Meltham.}Today only a few of the{mills
 remain working. Some of the{mills     
 stand unused, falling into ruins but  
 some are being used _as{store houses  
 and one is even being used as a       
{brewery.                              
                                       
{Meltham Mills Co-operative Society}   
   {Meltham Mills  Co-op}was started in
{1828}to provide cheaper food for      
 the{mill}workers.It is meant to be the
 first{co-op}in{Britain,}but no records
 were kept, so people think{Rochdale   
{Co-op}was the first, because they kept
 records.The only{co-op}now in{Meltham 
 is the{supermarket}in{Huddersfield    
{Road.                                 </content>
