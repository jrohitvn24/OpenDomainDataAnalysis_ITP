		<title>14Prestbury Railway Station.</title>
		<content>   The electrified railway line,from   
 London to Manchester,passes through   
 Macclesfield and Prestbury.The railway
 runs alongside the River Bollin on its
 route from Macclesfild to Prestbury.  
   Prestbury Station is quite small,   
 mainly used by commuters working in   
 Manchester.                           
   However,it has been badly vandalised
 in recent months.Prestbury Amenities  
 Society hope to restore the station to
 good condition and working order with 
 help from British Rail,as well.The    
 Society hope that it will help win    
 back the Best Village award for       
 Prestbury.                            
   The restored station will have open 
 fronted waiting areas with seats and a
 heated waiting room.                  
   Hopefully,there will be no more     
 complaints about Prestbury's railway  
 station being vandalised.             </content>
