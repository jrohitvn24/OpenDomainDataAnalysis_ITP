		<title>05POLLUTION IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 In the{Horrabridge}area we don't get  
 much pollution because we're not an   
 urban area.We don't get acid rain     
 because the predominant wind blows    
 from the sea.We don't have badly      
 polluted air because all of our power 
 comes from a{Hydro-Electric Power     
{Station}in{Mary Tavy}.You can't drink 
 the water from the river{Walkham      
 because some people throw rubbish into
 it and they go swimming in it.The only
{chemicals}we use in{Horrabridge}are   
 used by farmers but if they're blown  
 away they cause a lot of damage.Most  
 of our pollution comes from           
{litter}.Quite a lot collects in{Wier  
{Park}and up our school hill.It ranges 
 from paper bags,to tin cans,crisp     
 packets and sweet wrappers.
