		<title>01Orchardleigh Park</title>
		<content> The park land is nearly all pasture   
 with just a few trees to shelter the  
 cows.  The land slopes down to the    
 lake.  This is quite large with reeds 
 and bullrushes growing around it.     
 There is  a ruined boat house next to 
 a boggy area.  At one side there is an
 island joined by a bridge to the park.
 On the island is an old church.       
 Nearby, are a few cottages.  A large  
 part of the park is woodland.   This  
 is mainly deciduous  with oak, beech, 
 ash, horse chestnut  and sycamore.    
 Many pheasants and other game birds   
 are bred for a local shooting         
 syndicate.  There are lots of         
 footpaths leading through the park.
