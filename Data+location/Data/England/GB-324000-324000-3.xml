		<content>      {THE AREA AROUND TREFONEN}       
                                       
 Trefonen is in the country side and is
 three miles away from Oswestry.Most of
 the village is on the west side of the
 main road.There are many house and    
 roads going through the village.I live
 in Trefonen and go to Trefonen school.
 There are many farms and pubs         
 scattered around.More and more houses 
 are being built because people think  
 it's convenient to live here because  
 it's only three miles away from town. 
 Some people think that all these      
 houses being built spoil the country  
 side,but if there weren't any houses  
 Trefonen would be a thing of the past 
 and it would die away.
