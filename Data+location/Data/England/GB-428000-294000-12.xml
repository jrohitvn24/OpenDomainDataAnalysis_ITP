		<title>12MANCETTER QUARRIES</title>
		<content>       The Quarries at Mancetter have  
 been mined since the late 19th cent.  
 They are now owned by Tilcon. The rock
 from the quarries is Diorite or Basalt
 and Stockingford Shale.  About 3,000  
 tons are quarried per day. The rock   
 has to be drilled, exploded, sorted   
 and collected. The larger rocks have  
 to be crushed.                        
                                       
         Most of the material is bought
 by Local Authorities for Roadworks.   
 The Quarry also makes and supplies    
 Tarmac for road surfacing.            
        The Quarry employs 29 people   
 and is expected to last for another   
 15-20 years.                          
        When a Quarry is exhausted it  
 may be filled in and returned to      
 agriculture or flooded and used for   
 fishing and  Water Sports.
