		<content> The Norfolk Broads and the rivers     
 which join them offer excellent       
 facilities for a wide variety of      
 water-based activities from sailing to
 angling bird-watching.Great efforts   
 are being made in such areas as       
 Ranworth to improve these facilities  
 even more to cater for the thousands  
 of visitors who come to Norfolk and   
 the Broads each year as, well as for  
 local enthusiasts.                    
 However recreational pursuits of a    
 less outdoor type appear lacking      
 because of its being a predominantly  
 agricultural area.The nearest cinemas,
 clubs and dancehalls are in Norwich to
 the south or in Great Yarmouth to the 
 east.With public transport being very 
 poor,many people without access to a  
 car,feel rather isolated especially in
 the winter months.
