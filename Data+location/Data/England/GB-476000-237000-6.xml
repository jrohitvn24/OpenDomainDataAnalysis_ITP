 The Rectory was built around the 19th 
Century but while an excavation took   
place several years ago it was found   
that the history of Passenham dated    
back to Saxon times.                   
                                       
Supernatural - The 2 most famous       
ghosts of Passenham are Nancy Webb and 
Bobby Banister. The ghost of Nancy     
Webb has often been seen on the night  
of Deanshanger Feast. She always wore  
a white,silk dress and carried a baby  
in her arms. She would throw herself   
into the stream and get crushed by the 
mill wheel.    The Manor House is said 
to be haunted by the ghost of Bobby    
Bannister. People have seen the        
skeleton form of a huntsman with a     
broken neck dragged in the stirrup.
