		<title>13Industry - Hotpoint</title>
		<content>   Many of our parents  and some of our
 brothers and sisters work at the      
 Hotpoint factory.  Mr. Gamble, our    
 teacher,tried to arrange a visit, but 
 we weren't allowed to go because it   
 was considered too dangerous.  Instead
 Mr. Lavers, a manager from Hotpoint   
 came to visit us.   He told us that   
 there were 3 Hotpoint factories in the
 U.K., and that the factory in         
 Peterborough concentratres on fridges.
  Almost 2 000 people work there and   
 help to produce the 7 000 fridges made
 there each week.  All the fridges they
 make they sell straight away and at   
 the moment they cannot make enough.   
   Hotpoint does make other domestic   
 electrical appliances;  washing       
 machines, toasters and irons.         
 Hotpoint got its name from the newly  
 invented 'Hot-pointed iron' many years
 ago, which replaced the square irons. </content>
