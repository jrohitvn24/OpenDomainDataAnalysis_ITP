 agriculture as most of the land is set
 out in farms on the north facing slope
 of the valley of the River Wear.The

 grazing of sheep and cattle and the   
 production of the grass crops hay and 
 silage for winter feed.A small amount 
 of grain is also grown.               
 About half of the village of Toft Hill
 is included.The houses are mainly     
 built of stone and  arranged in       
 terraces in ribbon development beside 
 the main A68 road to Scotland.        
 Witton Castle built in 1410 A.D. has  
 its estate in the area.50% is used for
 agriculture;30% for forestry and 20%  
 for leisure.There is a caravan and    
 camping site including all the        
 necessary facilities.
