		<content> This area is mostly covered by        
 commercial chestnut coppicing. The    
 small hamlet at Bedham contains a     
 chapel built by the Mitford family    
 from Pitshill in 1880, as Bedham      
 belonged to their estate. Part of the 
 chapel was also used as a school for  
 the 9 houses until 1925 when it was   
 closed. The chapel in the East end of 
 the building was deconsecrated in     
 1959.
