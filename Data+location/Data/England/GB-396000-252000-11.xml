		<title>11EVENTS IN AREA</title>
		<content> A recent Sunday saw two major events  
 in the area. At Flyford Flavell the   
 village Social Committee organised an 
 'Open Day' when the public were       
 invited to visit a number of          
 activities in the village. The church 
 was decorated with examples of old    
 farming crafts and several local      
 residents opened their gardens for    
 displays of local art, pottery,       
 engraving  and cream teas. There were 
 a reasonable number of visitors but as
 with all such summer events good      
 weather is helpful and this day was   
 dull and cool.                        
 On the same afternoon a parents and   
 childrens Rounders and Barbecue event 
 was held by Flyford Flavell School    
 Parents Association on Flyford Flavell
 Cricket Ground. About 14O people      
 attended and all enjoyed a happy      
 family occasion.                      </content>
