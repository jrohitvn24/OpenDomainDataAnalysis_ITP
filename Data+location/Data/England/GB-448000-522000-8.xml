		<title>08COWPEN BEWLEY VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Most of{Cowpen Bewley}is farmland     
 which is owned by{I.C.I.}There are    
 two farms and a short terrace of      
 houses facing the road leading to a   
 recently automated level crossing.    
  An attractive village pub is         
 situated at the end of the terrace    
 which hides the beginning of an       
 industrial estate behind them.        
  Several more houses are grouped round
 the crossroads including a couple of  
 bungalows.There used to be a{Primary  
{School}in the village which was open  
 until the 1960's but this has been    
 converted into a house which  is now  
 occupied by a doctor.Children have to 
 travel in to nearby{Billingham}to     
 attend the local{Primary and          
{Comprehensive}schools.
