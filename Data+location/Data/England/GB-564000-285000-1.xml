		<title>01Osier Holt, Shrub Hill</title>
		<content>   This remote part of Fenland lies on 
 the borders of Norfolk, Suffolk and   
 Cambridgeshire. The Little Ouse River,
 flanked by flood protection           
 banks, flows SE -NW through the       
 block.                                
   Shrub Hill, with a maximum elevation
 of 1.6 metres above sea level stands  
 out from the surrounding countryside, 
 much of which is below sea level. The 
 soil is mainly peat over fen clay and 
 sand.                                 
   Shrub Hill has a Southery postal    
 address (7 miles away), School        
 children attend Feltwell Primary (5   
 miles) or Methwold Comprehensive      
 School. The East of the block forms   
 part of Hockwold Fens. South of the   
 River the district looks to the City  
 of Ely for its amenities.
