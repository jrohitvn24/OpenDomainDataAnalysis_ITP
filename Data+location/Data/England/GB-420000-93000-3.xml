		<title>03      NAISH FARM</title>
		<content>  Naish Farm was once a farm owned by  
 Mr. Burry. In 1902 people started     
 asking the owner if they could bring  
{caravans}for holidays. When the owner 
 died he left the farm in his will to  
 his son who built it into a holiday   
 resort. To rent a{chalet}for a week it
 costs Â£94.00.The amusements at Naish  
 Farm are {tennis, swimming}and an     
{arcade.}Altogether there are{1500     
{units}(chalets and caravans). There   
 are two rooms in each chalet. There is
 also a{bar}called the "Smugglers'     
 Retreat". Also there are two{shops,}a 
{newsagent}and a{supermarket.}Sometimes
 there is also a little{adventure      
{playground}for children but it is not 
 always open.
