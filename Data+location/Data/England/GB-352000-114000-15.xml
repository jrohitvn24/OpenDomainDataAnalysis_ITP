		<title>15The Mayor of Yeovil.</title>
		<content>    Joy Stanton,(now in her late       
 forties) was born &amp; brought up in     
 Barnstable.She is married with 1      
 daughter &amp; 2 grandchildren.On leaving 
 school she spent 5 years in the R.A.F,
 and moved to Yeovil in 1962.She became
 mayor in 1983 &amp; is now in her 3rd term
 of office,a record in Yeovil's        
 history.                              
    She sits on 31 committees &amp; likes  
 being Mayor as she enjoys meeting     
 people,but doesn't like the loss of   
 her private life,(on one Sunday alone 
 she got 41 phone calls).As mayor she  
 receives a yearly allowance of Â£2000,&amp;
 estimates she spends another Â£2000 of 
 her own money in performing her       
 duties.                               
    As a house wife Mrs. Stanton likes 
 gardening,knitting &amp; making clothes   
 for her grand children,but is not so  
 keen on housework.                    </content>
