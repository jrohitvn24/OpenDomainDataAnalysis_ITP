		<content> Trade in Ilford is very good. There   
 are lots of different kinds of shops, 
 although there are too many shoe      
 shops.There are newsagents, clothes   
 stores, department stores, building   
 societies,banks, grocers,sports shops 
 and electrical stores. We really need 
 more petrol stations and department   
 stores rather than so many food       
 stores. There is a lot of building    
 going on in Ilford at the moment, so  
 there will be a lot of new shops.     
 There is a new Sainsbury's under      
 construction which will be finished in
 1986. Several shops that have closed  
 are due to open again under a new     
 name.                                 
 Ilford is going to be made into a     
 traffic free shopping centre. Plans   
 have been drawn up and some           
 construction work is already under    
 way.                                  </content>
