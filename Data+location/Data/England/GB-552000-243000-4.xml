		<content>    Hadstock football club was formed  
 in about 1950 but about 25 years later
 nobody bothered to turn up so the club
 was disbanded.  After a few years a   
 handful of people started the club up 
 again, but unfortunately they haven't 
 got a single trophy to their name.    
    Their league is called the Rayments
 North West Essex league.  The team    
 practise on Sunday mornings before    
 their matches; they also practise on  
 Wednesday evenings if they have a     
 match on that week.                   
    The team have had a highest score  
 of 5-1, but they have been beaten 8-2.
    A new pavilion to be built near the
 ground.                               
    All the younger players have to go 
 to Ashdon to play, as there isn't a   
 junior club in Hadstock.
