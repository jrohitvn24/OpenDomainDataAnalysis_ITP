		<title>19SUMMARY,SOUTH BOLNEY BLOCK</title>
		<content> Most of the village of Bolney lies in 
 the Northern block, so we have not    
 surveyed the social life of the       
 villagers, which will be done by      
 others.                               
 We have concentrated on the rural     
 inhabitants, some of whom live fairly 
 isolated from other dwellings. All    
 have at least one car per dwelling,   
 which is just as well, since public   
 transport is infrequent. Some are     
 still on cess-pit drainage although   
 although we found one Tudor house     
 where a pump is still the only water  
 source.We found no households without 
 telephone or television;over half had 
 videos but very few had computors.Most
 have conveniences like washing        
 machines etc.                         
 Perhaps we are behind the times here, 
 but we found that people love living &amp;
 working here &amp; do not want changees.  </content>
