		<content> We found that satisfaction with the   
 area ius high - only 4% could think of
 nothing they liked.                   
 While access to town (l5%) and good   
 public transport (l7%) are important, 
 it is access to the countryside (32%) 
 people like most. With those who      
 referred to the pleasant appearance of
 parks and gardens (26%) and the       
 tidiness of the area (5%) then it is  
 clear that the quality of the         
 environment is a major factor in      
 peoples' lives. In Whickham it is the 
 village atmosphere (27%) and quiet    
 (20%) people like most - although     
 quiet in Lobley Hill (2%) seems       
 rarer.There it is access to shops and 
 local facilities (50%) which matter   
 most.  But happily to l5% it is still 
 community feeling and the friendliness
 of people they like best.
