		<content> People who live in the villages in our
 area have a choice of shopping in     
 either village between the post office
 and one other store. In Gurney Slade  
 there is a fresh meat butcher who also
 sells a wide range of general store   
 goods and fresh vegetables from       
 Bristol Market. It is a family firm   
 and also serves the outlying areas    
 with a travelling van. The Post Office
 is also a general store and paper     
 shop, with a dry cleaning agency. In  
 Oakhill the Post Office sells a range 
 of general household goods, gifts and 
 stationary with an off license. There 
 is also a local food store which is   
 another family concern and provides   
 the newspaper deliveries for the area 
 and has a dry cleaning agency. For    
 other shopping villagers must travel  
 to nearby towns and cities. Many shop 
 outside the village monthly or weekly.</content>
