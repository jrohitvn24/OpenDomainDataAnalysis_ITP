		<title>08THE RAILWAY AT HARRIETSHAM</title>
		<content> The Maidstone to Ashford rail link    
 crosses the A20 at Harrietsham and the
 level of the bridge is, and has been  
 causing difficulty for many years.    
 Some years ago the road was lowered   
 to allow better drainage and avoid    
 further flooding.  This was reasonably
 successful but further lowering of the
 road surface is now required due to   
 the number of large haulage vehicles  
 that find it impossible to pass under 
 it.  The line was electrified soon    
 after the second world war and with   
 the gradual introduction of new       
 carriages the service is quite        
 efficient. The replacement of old     
 track with new continuous welded track
 has reduced the noise level and       
 travelling by train has now become    
 dependable and pleasant.
