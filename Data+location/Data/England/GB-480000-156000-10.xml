		<content> The{Crown and Cushion}at 834572 is a  
 public house in Minley which is owned 
 by the Grand Metropolitan chain. It   
 serves bar meals and is popular among 
 business people and military personnel
 from the local barracks. It was       
 originally called the 'Cushion' but   
 the Crown Jewels were rumoured to have
 been stolen and hidden there in the   
 seventeenth century. It is a meeting  
 place for local clubs including the   
 Sandhurst &amp; Yateley Hunt and organises
 social functions.                     
                                       
      The{Ely Hotel,}822590, has a     
 restaurant, a grill, and a public bar 
 which are very popular. It is named   
 after a racehorse. An inn stood near  
 this site in Tudor times. This        
 building is about fifty years old.
