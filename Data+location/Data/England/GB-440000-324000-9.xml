		<content> The village of Wilson lies just within
 Leicstershire. It's only amenity is a 
 pub, the Bulls Head which serves      
 excellent meals and attracts customers
 from the surrounding area and groups  
 of ramblers at weekends.              
 For all other amenities and services  
 the residents must travel to Breedon  
 or Melbourne. The young children are  
 taken by bus to Breedon Junior School 
 and the older ones to Shepshed.       
 There being no central hall for social
 and community activities, a group of  
 residents hope to gain permission to  
 use a small disused chapel as a day   
 centre. Occasional village events are 
 organised by two families who each    
 have large gardens.                   
 Part time seasonal and casual         
 employment is provided at a local     
 market garden where vegetables are    
 trimmed and packed for sale.          </content>
