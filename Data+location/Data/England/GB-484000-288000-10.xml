		<content>When I visited my old school a 4th year
girl was doing 3 weeks happy work      
experience there. Built in 1948, the   
school looks externally shabby, but    
inside is all colour, with beautiful   
decorations and lots of books in the   
corridors and little children are very 
happy and busy. They have lots of play 
equipment, sand and water, writing and 
painting thins and pictures everywhere.
Little children learn the alphabet and 
how to count through play. Two classes 
went on an outing that day. The nursery
has slides and paddling pools. When    
children are hungry they can have      
crisps and apples. A quiet room is for 
reading. Teachers were always ready to 
share children's problems. Photos of   
the teachers and helpers, even the     
caretaker, are pinned up so that       
children know who everyone is. Everyone
is so friendly.                        </content>
