		<title>15MY TIME by PATRICK EASTO</title>
		<content> In my spare time, I go to Cubs and    
 Swimming and I also belong to the     
 Church Choir.  I have a Walkman which 
 I sometimes listen to.  I also like   
 watching television most days.  I like
 riding my bicycle round our estate and
 I also enjoy climbing up an oak tree. 
 Our family has a climbing frame.  I   
 often play with friends.  I play the  
 guitar for which i have lessons at    
 7.00 - 7.30.  I often invent          
 electrical things.  I enjoy woodwork, 
 and helping in the garden; I have even
 got my own patch of lawn.  I like     
 mowing the grass.  I like playing     
 rounders and cricket, looking at      
 historic buildings, drawing ( and I'm 
 quite good,) writing stories and      
 illustrating them too.  I usually camp
 outside at least twice a year.        
 Sometimes I invite friends to sleep   
 too and have a fry up on our barbecue.</content>
