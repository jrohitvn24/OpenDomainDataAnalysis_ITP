		<content> DRUGS ABUSE IN CHESHAM.               
 Regional health chiefs are to seek    
 more than a quarter of a million      
 pounds in Government aid to help      
 combat serious drugs abuse in the     
 area,where the number of addicts has  
 been estimated at about 600.The prob- 
 lem is the lack of people and places  
 to wipe out the abuse.It is estimated 
 that Â£231000 is spent a year on drugs 
 in this area.The money needed to help 
 the addicts reaches a total of 52500. 
 At the moment the only help the       
 addicts can get is from the family    
 docter and local psychiatrists.If we  
 don't do something soon to stop drug  
 abuse,an alarming number of           
 inhabitants of Chesham,may become     
 addicts.                              
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
