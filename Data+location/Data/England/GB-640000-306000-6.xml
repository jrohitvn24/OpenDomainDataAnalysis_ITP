		<content> The area has a variable soil type     
 ranging from sandy loam to silty clay 
 loam. This very fertile region is     
 therefore good for growing arable cash
 crops and sugar beet, oil seed rape,  
 wheat, barley, vining and dried peas, 
 dwarf green beans for processing,     
 cabbages and potatoes.                
 Some of the grass marshlands have     
 recently been drained and ploughed due
 to their high fertility. This has led 
 to conflict with conservationists.    
 The grassland supports sheep, beef and
 dairy cattle in the grazing season    
 (April through October). Hay and      
 silage are also produced for winter   
 feed.                                 
 Pigs are fattened on one holding.     
 The woodland is used for shooting and 
 conservation.
