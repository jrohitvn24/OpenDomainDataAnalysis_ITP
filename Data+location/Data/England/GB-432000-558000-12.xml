		<title>12'THE CAULD LAD OF HYLTON'</title>
		<content>                                       
 Legend says Hylton Castle is haunted  
 by the troubled spirit of Roger       
 Skelton, employed as a stable boy at  
 the turn of the 16th Century.   The   
 baron of Hylton had instructed the lad
 to have his horse ready for an early  
 morning gallop.  Roger failed to do   
 this.  Furiously the Baron strode into
 the stables to discover the boy curled
 up asleep in the hay.  The Baron      
 angrily snatched up a hay fork and    
 flung it at the lad killing him       
 instantly.  The Baron disposed of the 
 corpse in a nearby pond.  The ghost of
 Roger Skelton returned nightly, full  
 of mischief.  If the kitchen was in   
 order, he would soon have pots and    
 pans flying around.  If everything was
 disorderly he would tidy it           
 up.Eventually the remains of Roger    
 were buried in hallowed ground.       </content>
