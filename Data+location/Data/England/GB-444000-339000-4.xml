		<content> The Flamsteed Centre was built in     
 1952.  The centre is now 33 years old.
  Roughly 305 people go there a week.  
 There is a man called Mr Symes who has
 been working there for 7 years.  The  
 centre is open every day of the week  
 for elderly and disabled people.  On  
 three days a week they have their     
 dinner there - Monday, Tuesday and    
 Thursday.  Dinner is cooked in the    
 centre's kitchen by voluntary workers.
 Most days it is run by volunteers.  On
 Saturdays it is let to people for     
 weddings, 21st birthdays and often in 
 the evenings for discos.  Monday,     
 Thursday and Friday are the most      
 popular days.  Before today it was a  
 civil defence unit and then was       
 bought by the County Council for a    
 Social Service Centre for helping     
 those in need.
