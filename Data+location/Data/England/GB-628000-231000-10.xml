		<title>10The Dock (cont.)</title>
		<content>At the present time the politics of    
this matter is still being debated in  
Parliament as Ipswich  and Harwich     
docks, the other Haven Ports,  feel    
threatened by furher growth of         
Felixstowe Dock. If it is built, the   
extension will be called the Trinity   
Terminal after Trinity College who     
used to own the land. It takes 15hr to 
unload and reload each ship at         
Felixstowe, one container being loaded 
or unloaded every 3min. It is going to 
cost 8 million pounds to dredge the    
harbour so that it is deeper for the   
bigger ships. The Passenger services   
started in 1974 and there are frequent 
car ferries to the Continent,          
particularly Zeebrugge in Belgium. Day 
trips to Belgian and French hypermar-  
kets are inexpensive encourage tour-   
ism in Felixstowe.
