		<title>05Cliffe Common - Ecology</title>
		<content>      Cliffe Common was enclosed last  
 century, and is now used for farming. 
 One of the old roads on to the common 
 is still there. It is nearly overgrown
 and called Broad Lane Wood.           
      Cliffe Parish Council owns this  
 land and has just had a report from   
 the Nature Conservancy Council about  
 it. The report says the land should be
 kept as woodland because it is a      
 valuable habitat for wildlife.        
      Oaks are the commonest{trees,    
 there are some very large hawthorns   
 also rowan, crab apple, holly and     
 hazel.{Flowers}include primroses and  
 cowslips, and wood buttercup which    
 only grows in old woodland.           
     {Roe deer}come to the wood from   
 the larger wood on Skipwith Common to 
 the north, and there are{grey         
{squirrels}and owls.
