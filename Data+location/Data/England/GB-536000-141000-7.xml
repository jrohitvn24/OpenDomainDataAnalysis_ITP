 recorder and a dishwasher. None       
 questioned owned a coffee maker. All  
 these appliances were in frequent use 
 with the washing machine being used   
 most.                                 
   When we questioned people about the 
 animals they kept as pets dogs were   
 the most popular, cats were next      
 followed by rabbits, hamsters then    
 gerbils. One lady kept a canary for   
 company. Most people, when they went  
 on holiday had someone to look after  
 their pets and two people had entered 
 their pets in shows, one of them      
 having won prize money.

 less sugar, fat and salt and eating   
 more fibre.                           </content>
