		<title>09FOOTPATHS AROUND SHAWBURY</title>
		<content>   The{footpaths}were used for people  
 who went to{work,}for children going  
 to{school,}and for people going to {  
{church}.                              
   There used to be many footpaths in  
 this area but they got grown over,    
 stiles fell down and the signs got    
 broken and were never mended.This     
 happened because the paths were not   
 being used any more.People went around
 in{cars.                              
   The footpath that goes from{        
{Wytheford}to{Muckleton}is nearly      
 finished.It will take two years to    
 finish all of the footpaths.The{tools 
 that they use are spades,forks,pick-  
 axes,hammers,nails and brushing hooks.
 The Venture Scouts help too.          
   The longest walk is about six miles 
 around Muckelton and Edgebolton.There 
 will be fifteen walks around Shawbury.
