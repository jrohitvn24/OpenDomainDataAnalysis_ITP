 BUSH HALL FARM:{499093}The house dates
 from 1600. The present owner          
 S.Padfield has farmed the 450 acres   
 since 1968.No livestock are kept now  
 due to restrictions imposed by the    
 European Economic Community. The farm 
 employs 3 men ; in earlier times 50 to
 60 were needed at harvest times.      
 Employees live in tied cottages. There
 seems to be a general resentment of   
 E.C.C.dictates &amp; the remote           
 bureaucracy restricting freedom of    
 choice in the farming world. BUSH HALL
 is operated as one unit in a complex  
 covering 1600 acres. Machine          
 operations are powered by a range of  
 4-wheel drive tractors from 100 to 250
 horse-power costing from Â£22 to Â£55000
