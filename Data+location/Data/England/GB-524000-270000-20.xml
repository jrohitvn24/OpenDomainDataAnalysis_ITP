		<content>                                       
 The town has always been the centre of
 an agricultural area.It was a great   
 coaching centre the main  hostelries  
 being the Falcoln,the Fountain and the
 George.As the railways developed it   
 was the natural choice to build into a
 great railway centre,but the Earl     
 of Sandwich opposed this idea and     
 refused to sell the land.Huntingdon   
 thus remained a small population of   
 some 5,000 people until the policy of 
 bringing people out of London after   
 the war caused its considerable       
 expansion.The town centre today is    
 still relatively small consisting of a
 narrow High Street.An addition to the 
 high street has been Chequers court.In
 the high street are banks,building    
 societies,supermarkets,shops and      
 stores.
