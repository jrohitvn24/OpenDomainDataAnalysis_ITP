		<title>14THE PINFOLD,HAMBLETON.</title>
		<content> The Pinfold is situated near the      
 junction of the A63 and Common        
 Lane.The Pinfold was built before 1554
 when most fields had no boundry fences
 or natural hedges to keep the animals 
 in.So most animals became strays.The  
 Pinder was the name given to the owner
 of the Pinfold and it was his job to  
 collect all stray animals.The charge  
 for the owner to retrieve his stock   
 was 2d for every score of sheep 4d for
 a number of pigs and 1d for a horse or
 beast.The Pinder didn't have to feed  
 the animal unless they were left over 
 before being claimed then an extra    
 charge was made for feeding.If the    
 animal was not claimed in a week the  
 Pinder could sell it.The Pinfold was  
 restored in 1980,and now set into the 
 wall is a beautiful carved plaque made
 by Mr.A.Steels of the village crest.
