		<content>   Most people living within our block 
 live in{terraced houses}built from the
 traditional{Belsay stone.}These houses
 are found within the village itself.  
 The rest of the inhabitants live in   
{cottages}or former{farmhouses}also    
 built from Belsay stone. The          
 accommodation was once entirely owned 
 by the Middleton family but many      
 houses are now owner-occupied.        
   There has not been any recent       
 building within the area. The people  
 whom we talked to said that their     
 houses were between{70 and 200 years  
{old.}However there has been some      
 modernisation of the existing         
 buildings as many people have         
 installed central heating.
