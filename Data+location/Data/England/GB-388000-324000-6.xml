		<title>06Legionnaires Disease(Staffs)</title>
		<content>An inquiry has been launched after 39  
people died of the disease.At least 160
people were taken ill and taken into   
hospital.Many nurses,doctors and other 
people connected with the hospital have
proved to have had mild doses of the   
disease.At first victims were being    
treated for bronchial pheumonia until  
the legionnaires disease virus was     
discovered.One theory on where the     
bacteria was cultivated is,in a cooling
tower at the new Stafford District     
General Hospital.As the water carrying 
the disease evaporated,the germs       
became airborne and spread via the air 
conditioning system to the outpatients 
department.Normally the bacteria which 
forms in air conditioning systems is   
killed by biocides -usually chlorine.  
The effectiveness of this treatment is 
to be considered by the inquiry.
