		<title>15ECOLOGY/WILDLIFE IN DUNMOW</title>
		<content> Our block is predominantly rural and  
 intensively cultivated,there are some 
 remnants of the old forests.These have
 been preserved for shooting and       
 hunting but also for conservational   
 purposes.The farmers we interviewed   
 all stressed their commitment to the  
 preservation of the countryside.Many  
 new trees are planted each year,and   
 ponds and lakes created.There are deer
 in the forests and much wildlife,     
 including pheasants which are reared  
 for game.The preservation orders help 
 to conserve the remaining woodland.The
 practice of enlarging fields by taking
 up hedges which has caused total      
 concern in the past,has now ended.This
 year there are new laws concerning    
 strawburning.The River Chelmer flows  
 through the town,and is crossed by the
 old bridge at Churchend.It flows      
 through the recreation ground.        </content>
