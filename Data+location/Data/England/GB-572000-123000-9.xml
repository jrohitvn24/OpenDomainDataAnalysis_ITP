   {Local History}There has been a mill
 on the site since 1380 using water    
 power.There is still a water wheel    
 under the present mill.The old mill   
 building was rebuilt in 1880 following
 a fire.The new building was erected in
 1950 and re-modernised in 1968.       
  {Trade}The mill was bought by the    
 Southern Counties Agricultural Trading
 Society in 1978.This society began as 
 a farmers'  cooperative buying animal 
 food in bulk.They now produce many    
 different foodstuffs themselves and   
 sell to wholesalers.                  
  {Employment}S.C.A.T.S. employs 6     
 workers in the mill ,several drivers  
 and representatives and 3 laboratory  
 technicians together with management  
 and office staff.
