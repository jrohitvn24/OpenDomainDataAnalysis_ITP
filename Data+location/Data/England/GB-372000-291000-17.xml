		<title>17Land Use</title>
		<content> In general the whole of the land use  
 within the area, excluding the town   
 itself, is agricultural, with a       
 portion of woodland. All the land to  
 the East of the river, trapped between
 it and the sandstone hills forms very 
 rich agricultural land. All other land
 in the area being above this plane is 
 formed from more shallow sandy soil.In
 many places the natural sandstone lies
 no more than a few inches below the   
 surface, limiting the types of crops  
 to be grown. Most of the woodland in  
 the area is formed from coniferous    
 type timber, with the exception of the
 odd remains of the old Forest of      
 Morfe.Most of the land belongs to one 
 of two large historically based       
 estates, both of which whilst keeping 
 abreast of modern methods are aware of
 their responsibilities to the area.
