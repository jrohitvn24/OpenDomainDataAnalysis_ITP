		<title>16COASTAL EROSION,WITHERNSEA</title>
		<content>  The Withernsea coast comprises of    
 Glacial Drift material from the last  
 ice age.It is of soft material,forming
 low cliffs,easily eroded by the sea at
 a rate of 2 metres per year.The sea   
 removes material from the cliff base, 
 causing the upper section to slump    
 during periods of wet weather when the
 clay becomes saturated and lubricated 
 with water.Longshore Drift and        
 currents remove the material out to   
 sea and southwards along the coast. At
 Withernsea a sloping concrete sea wall
 protects the built-up area from       
 erosion.The base of the wall is       
 protected from being undermined by the
 sea using a series of wooden groynes  
 built out at right angles to the      
 wall to low tide level. These prevent 
 the beach from being totally removed  
 by longshore drift and destructive    
 waves.                                </content>
