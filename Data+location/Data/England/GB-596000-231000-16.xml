		<title>16PATTINSON'S FRUIT FARM</title>
		<content> Mr Pattinson started his fruitfarm in 
 Gt.Horkesley in 1935 with 60          
 acres.There are now 332 acres and the 
 orchards strech out as far as leaven  
 heath.                                
   Desert apples are grown on 272      
 acres_about 80,000 trees.The main crop
 being Cox apples.Black currants are   
 grown on the other 60 acres but this  
 varies from year to year as the bushes
 are grubbed out and replanted.The farm
 employs 15 men and 22 women full time 
 and in the picking season about 200   
 casual workers.They have storage for  
 15,036 tons of apples and distribute  
 apples to the sale mackets throughout 
 the U.K.Many fruit farms work together
 as a cr_opertive but Pattinsons work  
 on their own and are the largest      
 independant growers in the U.K.Next   
 season they hope to export the early  
 Discovery apples to Belguim.          </content>
