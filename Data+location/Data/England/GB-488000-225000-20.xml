		<content> There is great concern in Linslade    
 that the nearest major hospital       
 facilities are 12 miles away, and     
 communications with them are not good.
 There is high local support for the   
 proposal to provide a Community       
 Hospital in the town to complement the
 more intensive high technology        
 treatment centres at Luton and        
 Aylesbury and provide more accessible 
 support for the elderly.              
 Because of the continuing teachers'   
 unrest, children are being released   
 from school at 2.00pm. This is a cause
 for concern amongst many parents who  
 work until late afternoon and are     
 worried about their children getting  
 into trouble after school.            
 Straw burning continues to be an      
 activity which causes much anger      
 locally. Farmers are being restricted 
 as to when and how they burn off.     </content>
