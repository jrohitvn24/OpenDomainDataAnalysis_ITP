		<content> Some evidence of wild animals was     
 apparent, and those actually seen - or
 identified from tracks and droppings -
 include badgers, fallow deer,         
 field-mice, foxes, hares, hedgehogs,  
 moles and rabbits.                    
                                       
 The woodland and hedgerows provides a 
 settled habitat for the large variety 
 of birds, and the latter would        
 obviously offer a large variety of    
 winter food. Parts of the woodland are
 used as pheasant praeserves, and this 
 environment induces many wild birds to
 spend all,or part, of the year there. 
 One sees blackbirds, blue-tits,       
 chaffinches, collared doves, great    
 tits,, hedge sparrows, linnets,       
 long-tailed tits, partridges,         
 pheasantas, rooks, starlings,swallows,
 wagtails, wood pigeons and wrens.
