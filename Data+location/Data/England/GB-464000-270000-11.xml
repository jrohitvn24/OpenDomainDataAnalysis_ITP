		<content>The bells of Saint Denys church call us
to worship every Sunday.Holy communion 
is celebrated at 8am or 11am,          
alternately there is morning prayer    
with a special version once a month for
families about 30 - 40 people attend.  
There are about 16 children of 3-11    
years in the Sunday School and they    
support a project in Bangladesh.The    
church is financed by subscription of  
its' members,legacies and social       
occaasions.About 2500 pounds is sent to
Peterborough yearly towards the vicar's
stipend.For the past 20 years we have  
shared a priest with East Haddon and   
Holdenby but the living is vacant just 
now.This means that the organisation is
done by the PCC and retired or visiting
clergy take the services.A modern      
vicarage stands next to the church and 
the vicar plays an important part in   
the life of the church.                </content>
