		<title>12CROSSING GATES CLAXBY</title>
		<content> Approximately one mile from Claxby    
 village centre there is a railway     
 crossing with gates operated manually.
 During a 16 hour day for one week the 
 gates are opened as indicated below:  
 Cars                   277            
 Vans                    78            
 Lorries                 71            
 Tractors                25            
 Motor cycles/scooters   46            
 Cycles                  13            
 Walkers                 12            
 In the same time the number of trains 
 which passed this point is indicated  
 below:                                
 Passenger trains        92            
 Freight trains          13            
 Engines                 15            
 When this survey was taken the guards 
 were on strike, which means the       
 freight traffic was down by about two 
 thirds.                               </content>
