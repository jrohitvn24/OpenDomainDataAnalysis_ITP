		<title>11TRANSPORT IN FRANKLEY</title>
		<content> Those living in the older part own    
 cars and can easily travel into the   
 City to the many theatres,cinemas or  
 restaurants.Via the M5 they can travel
 to other midland counties,Wales and   
 even London in a few hours.Worcester, 
 Warwick and Stratford are all great   
 tourist attractions easily reached    
 from Frankley;as indeed is most of the
 country  using the Gravelly Hills     
 Interchange("Spaghetti Junction")in   
 Birmingham.Only about half of the     
 families on the Frankley Est.own a    
 car.Others use the bus to go to Rubery
 or  Northfield shopping.Most use the  
 train from Longbridge to travel to    
 Birmingham.There used to be a railway 
 running through the area.Many people  
 feel it would be helpful to them to   
 have such a line with a station in    
 Frankley.
