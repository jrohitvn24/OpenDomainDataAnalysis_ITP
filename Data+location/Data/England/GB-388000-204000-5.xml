		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD</title>
		<content> I wake up at 7.30 am.I get on my      
 clothes of jeans and a T-shirt.  I go 
 downstairs and have some Shreddies for
 breakfast.  I go to school which      
 begins at 9 a.m. We work until a break
 when I eat my crisps and a chocolate  
 bar.  After some more work we have    
 lunch. Today I brought some lettuce   
 and tomato sandwiches. I play football
 or  "British Bulldog" then there      
 is more school work to do until 3.30. 
 There can be Chess or Computer clubs  
 after school.At home I play with Holly
 our Labrador dog.  Sometimes I watch  
 television or play football with my   
 friend James in Bearsfield.  We have  
 our tea at 6 p.m.of salad or something
 like that. After that I might watch   
 television or play with the dog again.
 My favourite television programmes are
 cartoons. I go to bed at 8 p.m. and I 
 read a book until I go to sleep.      </content>
