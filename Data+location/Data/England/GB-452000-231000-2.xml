		<title>02ALL SAINTS' CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church in Croughton is thought to 
 have been first built soon after the  
 first Domesday survey, and consecrated
 about 1080.  Changes took place over  
 the centuries, and currently time and 
 effort is being expended in fund      
 raising for restoration.  The first   
 part of the restoration programme was 
 completed in 1983, and a second       
 campaign is underway, with work to    
 begin after Easter 86.                
                                       
 A particular feature of the  church   
 is the {wall paintings}, probably     
 painted between 1280 and 1300, and    
 consequently plastered over at the    
 Reformation.  Re-discovered in 1921,  
 they are in dire need of conservation.
 They are important to the history of  
 English art, particularly for the     
 completeness of the story cycles of   
 the life of Christ and the Virgin.    </content>
