		<title>01WESTBURY- A SUMMARY</title>
		<content>   Westbury has moved a very long way  
 from the rural country town with its  
 weekly wool market and finds itself   
 become something of a centre for small
 manufacturing and light industrial    
 companies with an expanding population
 of 7500. The reasons for this are     
 the various small estates around the  
 town but also its road links with the 
 south coast, Bristol and the Midlands,
 whilst London itself is no more than  
 two and a half hours away - one and a 
 half by rail.  It has strong connec-  
 tions with the Army.  Many new housing
 estates are being built to cater for  
 the increased population and the area 
 is well served with churches and      
 chapels of many denominations.  The   
 three schools play their part in      
 preparing the children to take their  
 place in this new Westbury.
