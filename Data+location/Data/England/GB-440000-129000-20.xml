		<content>  My name is Clifford Bruce and this is
 how I spend my Sundays.I get up at    
 about 10.00a.m.and put my jeans and   
 army jumper on,then I have my         
 breakfast.I then put my motor bike    
 boots on and collect my helmet and    
 walk to Moorcourt Farm to get my bike 
 and meet Kevin Smith who collects his 
 scramble bike.We go up to the pit and 
 ride up big hills and fall off.We then
 meet Chris Collins and ride across to 
 Nomansland,we then return and put     
 the bikes away. My bike is made up    
 from a scramble and a road bike.Road  
 bikes are used on the road and        
 scramble bikes are ridden across dirt 
 tracks.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
