		<content>    In our part of Acle there are a few
 houses, some old and some new. They   
 also had a Police Station and a       
 Railway Station by the main road.They 
 have a market which sells a variety of
 things but it was not in our block.The
 High School was in our block but it is
 not on the main road.                 
    We interviewed people in Acle and  
 all said they would like a bypass so  
 it obviously needs a bypass.We also   
 found that the most popular place for 
 weekly shopping, half-yearly items and
 occasional items were either Norwich  
 or Yarmouth. Some people shopped for  
 occasional items in Acle and Acle     
 market.No one shopped for things like 
 furniture in Acle even though there   
 was a small furniture shop next to the
 garrage.
