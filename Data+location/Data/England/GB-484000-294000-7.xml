		<title>07Lyddington Church today.</title>
		<content> Although in the 1980's the church does
 not hold the central position in the  
 life of the villagers as it did in    
 former times,it is still looked after 
 and loved by many.Less than a third of
 the population attend services        
 regularly,but more at Christmas and   
 Harvest Festivals.The fabric of the   
 building is well kept,recently the    
 roof has been repaired,new tarmac laid
 on all the paths around the church and
 the churchyard in general kept neat   
 and tidy.Inside there are new         
 embroidered kneelers,new curtains,    
 carpets and linen for the Communion   
 Table.The Altar is quite unique,being 
 completely surrounded by the altar    
 rails on all four sides and dated 1635
 There are 6 bells, which are rung     
 most Sundays.The lighting has been    
 renewed, all this enhancing an already
 beautiful interior.                   </content>
