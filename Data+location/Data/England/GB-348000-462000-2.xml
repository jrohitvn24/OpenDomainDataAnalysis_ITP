		<content>I don't go to any clubs,because there  
aren't any in my area.Even if there    
were clubs in my area I don't think I  
would go to them.I play records at     
home,but most of the records belong to 
my sister.I play these records when I  
am doing my homework or just when I'm  
bored.I don't have a job.The only jobs 
I do are going to the shops for people 
or helping them with their housework.  
Jobs are like paper rounds etc. which  
you get paid for,so you can't really   
call housework a job.My favourite sport
is swimming.I go swimming about twice a
month.My best swimming stroke is back- 
stroke.I enjoy swimming,and I go to the
Kingsway Baths.I prefer to go to the   
Leisure Centre at Morecambe,because it 
is much nicer and it is an open-air    
pool.
