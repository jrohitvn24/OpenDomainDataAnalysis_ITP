		<title>13Banwell Caves</title>
		<content>                                       
     There are two main caves in       
 Banwell. In one of the caves they     
 found animal bones. Some of the bones 
 are still stacked in the cave, while  
 others are in Taunton Museum. In the  
 other there are many stalagmites.     
 The caves belong to Mr and Mrs.       
 Sargent and Mr. and Mrs. Haines. They 
 live 30 metres above the caves.       
    Unlike the caves at Cheddar and    
 Burrington,they open on to the summit 
 of hill instead of a ravine. The caves
 are appproached by a little grotto    
 from the grounds of the house. There  
 is no lighting as such in the cave and
 candles and torches have to be used to
 enable people to see.                 
     The caves were discovered in 1824 
 by Mr. Beard, who stacked all the     
 bones along the walls of the caves.   
 There are remains of extinct animals. </content>
