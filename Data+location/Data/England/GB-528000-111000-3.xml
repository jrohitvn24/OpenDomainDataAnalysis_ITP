		<title>03CLAYTON PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> The Parish Council is responsible for 
 many things such as footways,         
 lighting, recreation grounds and      
 trees. They are the trustees for the  
 District Council and make sure that   
 all bills are paid.  The records go   
 back to 23 November 1896 when the     
 parish council started. The money that
 the Parish Council needs is given to  
 them by the District Council.  There  
 are eleven people on the Parish       
 Council. The Parish Council is        
 planning to build a new pavilion at   
 Clayton Green which is going to be one
 of their projects.  The Queen's       
 dressmaker whose name was Norman      
 Hartnell is buried at Clayton.        
 Pyecombe parish extends south and west
 of Clayton. Each month a magazine "The
 Pyecombe Parish News" duplicated by   
 the Clerk includes articles and events
 relating to village life.             </content>
