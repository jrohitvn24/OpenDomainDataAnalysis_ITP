		<content>{   Satterthwaite}village has a shop, a
 pub, some holiday cottages, a church, 
 a parish room and some houses.        
                                       
{   The church}was built in 1850 and   
 its average attendance now is about

 is the Harvest Festival. There are 2  
 services each week, one is on a Friday

 church organ is in good order, and    
 there hasn't been any vandalism.      
 In the last five years there have been
 3 funerals, 2 marriages and 4         
 baptisms.                             
                                       
{   The Parish Room}was first opened   
 in 1894. It is well used by the W.I., 
 the Youth Club, the Parish Council,   
 and other local groups. It is in good 
 condition. Mrs E. A. Lamb cleans the  
 parish room and the church.           </content>
