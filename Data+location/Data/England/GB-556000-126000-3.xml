		<title>03Employment in Mayfield</title>
		<content> The area lacks any major employment,  
 especially for the young.Its for this 
 reason that many people who live in   
 the area have to commute to           
 neighbouring towns such as Tunbridge  
 Wells,Heathfield &amp; Brighton,as well as
 London which is only an hours drive   
 away.                                 
 There is employment on various farms_ 
 dairy,chicken,stud,&amp; arable.In the    
 village the shops,banks,hotel &amp; public
 houses provide employment as well as  
 the Convent School,Mayfield College,  
 Mayfield Children's Home &amp; the Old    
 People's Home.Mayfield has a milk     
 transporting company which employs    
 mostly local men as lorry drivers.    
 Mayfield has a few specialist         
 employers such as a tennis racket     
 stringer,harpsicord maker,building    
 company etc.all create employment for 
 local people.                         </content>
