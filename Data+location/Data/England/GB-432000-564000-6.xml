		<title>06THE TYNE TUNNELS</title>
		<content> There are two tunnels linking Jarrow  
 and Howdon,under the River Tyne.The   
 pedestrian tunnel,when opened in      
 1951,had the longest single escalator 
 in the world.There is also a lift at  
 each end so that people with prams can
 use the tunnel.The Tyne Traffic Tunnel
 was completed in 1967 at a cost of    
 &amp;21,000,000 and was built to cope     
 with the increase in traffic that     
 used the Great North Road that ran    
 through Gateshead and Newcastle.A     
 tunnel was built because the Tyne is  
 wide at this point and a bridge would 
 have cost more.Buses,lorries,cars and 
 motorbikes use the tunnel.A toll is   
 charged for each vehicle and the      
 current charges are:buses and lorries 
 80p,cars 40p and motorbikes 20p.
