		<title>11THE OBSERVATORY</title>
		<content>   An  observatory  is a  building from
 which you can   observe objects in the
 sky with the  aid of  telescopes.  The
{observatory} at  Cranfield  was  built
 by  Prof. Loxham at his home in Aspley
 Heath  in  1968. In 1980 it was  moved
 to its  present  position in  Mitchell
 Mitchell Rd. It  has a concrete floor,
 white glass walls and is 12' diameter.
   A motor drives  the whole thing, the
 roof  revolves so  that the gap can be
 moved into the  right  position to see
 through.  The  turntable  of the tele-
 scope is set parallel to the  equator,
 the  telescope  can  be  moved  on the
 turntable and on the tilting  spindle.
   An astronomical society exists which
 looks after the telescopes; a 16"     
 Cassegrain, a 3" Refractor  Prominence
 (sun telescope), an 8"Newtonium, and a
 6" Refractor.
