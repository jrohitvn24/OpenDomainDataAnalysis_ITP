		<title>08KENNELS FARM</title>
		<content>  Kennels Farm is so named because it  
used to house the hunting dogs.Nicola, 
the cowgirl, has been working there for
3 years. She gets up at 6.00a.m and    
goes to bed at 9.30p.m.She does at     
least 12 jobs in a day. Examples are:- 
       Milking                         
       Helping to deliver calves.      
       Cleaning out cow sheds.         
       Pasteurising the milk.          
       Feeding and cleaning bulls      
       Helping to make silage.         
  Kennels owns 92 cows and 3 beef bulls
and the dung is spread over the fields 
as manure.                             
  The pedigree Jersey cows each produce
15-30 litres of high fat milk daily.The
milk has to be sent to Wakefield's     
Yorkshire Dairies since no other Dairy 
wants it because it contains alot of   
fat.When the farmer wants to sell his  
stock he travels to Crewe.             </content>
