		<content> On the path to the Bridestones Farm is
 a stone set in the wall.On the top of 
 this stone is a cross;on the side is  
 the letter B.This is a boundary stone 
 between Cheshire and Staffordshire.   
 The old barn at the farm still        
 contained the circular holes high up  
 through which hay or grain was passed 
 many years ago.Beyond the farm the    
 land was mostly rough grazing divided 
 by stone walls.However the ridge      
 itself was heather and bilberry       
 amongst moorland grass.In many places 
 this has been cleared and replanted   
 with small conifer plantations.These  
 are being invaded by Rhododendron.The 
 trees are mostly Scots Pine and Larch 
 Rowan and Silver Birch grow naturally 
 where there is no grazing.
