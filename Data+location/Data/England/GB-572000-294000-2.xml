 Methwold Church was built in the 14th 
 century by an unknown builder. The    
 church has a choir, an organ and a    
 organist.The church is 500 years      
 old.The windows are very old and are  
 called perpendicular windows. The     
 church building materials are flint   
 and stone also pieces of concrete.On  
 the windows are  pictures of Mary and 
 Jesus also of the star the shepherds  
 and the animals.The colours in the    
 windows are                           
 green,red,purple,blue,pink,brown,     
 yellow,black,white,burgandy and       
 orange.The bells in the tower were    
 removed because the frame work would  
 not hold the bell's weight.The church 
 has a damaged brass .The church has   
 had one vandal but luckly nothing was 
 taken.                                </content>
