		<content>Mr Parker then  became the chairman of 
the company. In 1953 the port suffered 
a setback when disastrous east coast   
floods overwhelmed part of Felixstowe. 
In 1958 H.M. Customs &amp; Excise appointed
the 1st Landing Officer. The company g-
ot permission to use the Hammerhead Cr-
ane and the Crane Pier at the Felixsto-
we Royal Air Force Station for a heavy 
lift service up to 50 tons for vessels 
operated by J.Fisher and Sons LTD. On  
July 26th 1966 in the early hours of   
the morning there was a very serious   
fire that damaged the maltings badly.  
The first translantic container vessel 
was worked on the 1st July 1967 and by 
March 1968 the whole facility was com- 
pleted at last.The port's plans for the
future are building a new terminal next
year, although conservationists are    
concerned about damage to the ecology  
of the environment at Fagbury cliff.   </content>
