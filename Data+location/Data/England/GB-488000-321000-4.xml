		<content> The lovely little church in the Parish
 of Gunby stands on a small hillock in 
 the centre of the village.  Services  
 that were once held regularly each    
 Sunday, and attended by most of the   
 villagers, have, in 1985, been        
 reduced to two services a month.  On  
 the second Sunday in each month Holy  
 Communion is taken at 8.30 a.m. and on
 the last Sunday on the month Evensong 
 is sung at 5.00 p.m.                  
 The Rector, the Reverend Noel Stone,  
 lives 3 miles away in South Witham. He
 is responsible for the Christian soul 
 in that village as well as Gunby,     
 Stainby and North Witham.             
 Gunby Church, when filled to capacity 
 will seat approximately 150 people,   
 but an average attendance is perhaps  
 fifteen, of which two will be Gunby   
 residents, the others, regular        
 church-goers from the neighbouring    </content>
