		<title>07THE HILL VILLAGE HALL</title>
		<content> The Hill Village Hall is about 100    
 years old and was originally built as 
 a Methodist chapel. Now the Village   
 Hall is raising money to have some    
 improvements done. The Village Hall   
 has a little kitchen and poor toilets 
 so the improvements are to build a    
 bigger kitchen and some better        
 toilets. The Village Hall has various 
 entertainments for the village such as
 the Christmas Carol Service. The money
 raised goes to children's charities.  
 Every month there is a talk about an  
 interesting subject. Out of the 146   
 households we surveyed 35% were       
 represented at The Hill Gala, 27% at  
 The Hill Produce Show and 23% at the  
 Carol Service. 62% of families in our 
 area do not attend functions at The   
 Hill Village Hall at all.
