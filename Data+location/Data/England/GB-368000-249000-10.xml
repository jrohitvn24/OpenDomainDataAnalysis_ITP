		<content> The area has an electricity supply and
 all houses are connected to it. There 
 is no gas supply although a mains pipe
 runs through the area and there is a  
 pumping station. There are weekly     
 deliveries of bottled gas used for gas
 fires and some houses have gas central
 heating. Many houses have reverted to 
 using wood with the popularity of the 
 new wood stoves.  Coal is delivered   
 weekly if needed. Many houses have    
 Rayburns, Agas, or similar stoves,    
 fuelled by coal.   Oil for cooking and
 central heating is delivered regularly
 with depots in the main towns around. 
 The nearest petrol stations are in    
 Bishops Frome and Bromyard, the only  
 petrol station in the area having     
 closed since the war.  The area is    
 well supplied providing the roads are 
 not blocked with snow.  Everyone needs
 to keep good supplies in the winter.  </content>
