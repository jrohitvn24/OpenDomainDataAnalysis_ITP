		<content> The information on this area of{South 
{Yorkshire}was compiled by{children}of 
 the following{schools:                
                                       
{Pontefract Road First School, Cudworth
{Snydale Road First School, Cudworth   
{Two-Gates First School, Shafton       
{St Helen's Junior School, Monk Bretton
                                       
 We all found the work very            
{interesting}although it took a long   
 time to walk round the area taking    
 notes and talking to people. Perhaps  
 in years to come you will see our work
 and think how{strange}it must have    
 been to live in{1985}with{wars,       
{inequality, famine, sickness}and      
{unemployment.}We hope that when you   
 read this you have put all these      
 terrible things behind you and are    
 able to live together in{peace}and    
{goodwill.                             </content>
