		<title>15NAPTON BRICKWORKS</title>
		<content> At Napton brickworks they used to make
 floor tiles, roof tiles and bricks.   
 They made the tiles out of plastic    
 clay. They got the clay from near the 
 windmill, it was called a pit. Where 6
 men were in a pit, 2 men were clearing
 the soil, 2 men were blowing the rock,
 2 men were working on the clay digging
 it out. Then they sent it to the works
 in a dumper or a truck. The canal was 
 at the bottom by the brickworks and   
  was used to get coal to light the    
 fires for the kilns. When the plastic 
 clay got to the works it was ground,  
 put through a grid and rollers and    
 came out in a strip which was cut into
 squares, pressed and dried. 35000 were
 made a day. 110 people worked there.  
 The bricks were sold to merchants all 
 over the country. The canal was used  
 to carry the bricks but later trucks  
 were used.                            </content>
