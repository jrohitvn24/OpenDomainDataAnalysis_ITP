		<title>14HOUSING IN BACKWELL</title>
		<content>    The first impression that is       
 given,of the houses on the main road  
 is that they are well maintained ,    
 pre war houses with large attractive  
 gardens. It is surprising that so many
 people want to live on the main roads 
 that run through Backwell, as they are
 usually busy and the houses are quite 
 expensive. People buy them because    
 they are large ,close to the          
 countryside ,and because the local    
 school has a good reputation .        
    A lot ofthe houses further from the
 centre are quite new and about half of
 them have been made by the council.The
 older houses tend to have larger      
 grounds because the price of ground   
 has gone up during the years . In the 
 newer area people are younger as they 
 can't afford the bigger houses .
