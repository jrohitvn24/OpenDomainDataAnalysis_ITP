		<title>15PRESTON VILLAGE GREEN</title>
		<content> The green is at the centre of the     
 village.Once,a sheep fair was held    
 here each October but this ended at   
 the start of the 1st World War by     
 which time it had become a funfair.   
 The well was the gift of William Henry
 Darton.It was dug in the summer of    
 1872 when most of the ponds_from which
 all water was drawn_had dried up.A    
 feature of the green used to be 5 elm 
 trees.These were felled in 1946 after 
 being declared unsafe.One was planted 
 to commemorate the coronation of      
 George 111.At the coronation of Queen 
 Elizabeth in 1953, an oak sapling from
 the Royal Oak at Hatfield was planted.
 Around the green are many old cottages
 the Red Lion pub and the post office. 
 The whole is a conservation area and  
 an attractive focal point for the     
 village.
