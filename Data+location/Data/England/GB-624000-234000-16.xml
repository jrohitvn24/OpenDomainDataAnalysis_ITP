		<title>16Welcome Hall,Trimley</title>
		<content>  The only public hall in our block is 
the Welcome Hall,Trimley.  It was given
to the villages by a landowner,        
Mr.Pretyman of Orwell Park,about eighty
years ago.  The Hall is run by trustees
representing many village              
organisations.                         
  The Hall is used for weddings and    
other private parties, but mainly for  
regular meetings of clubs and groups.  
These include the Welcome Playgroup,   
the Mothers and Toddlers group,Weight  
Watchers,the Over 60s Club, the Mothers
Union and both the Women's Institutes. 
  The local Health Authority use the   
hall for Health Clinics,the church     
holds a Sunday School there and        
Felixstowe Musical Theatre rehearses   
there each week.                       
  St.Mary's Parish Council would like  
to see another,larger hall built,but   
cannot find a suitable site.           </content>
