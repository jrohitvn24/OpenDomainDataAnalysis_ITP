		<title>10Ecology - A Bird Survey.</title>
		<content>    In the field next to our school we 
set up a number of bird feeding areas  
and over about two weeks we surveyed   
the different types of birds that came 
to feed. In these feeding areas we put 
out the following types of             
food-nubble-mix,rabbit mix, biscuit    
crumbs,apple cores,crisps etc.We kept a
count of the visiting birds.The most   
common of course were the sparrows but 
there were also quite a number of      
magpies and swallows. We spotted four  
swifts and two blackbirds. There were  
 lso a number of seagulls &amp; one thrush.
    We also went for a walk around our 
 rea and looked for dead birds.Four had
been hit by cars some were undamaged.We
discovered that many of these birds    
were affected by pesticides a sprays   
put on the fields.In particular the    
finches seemed to be most affected.
