		<title>10Farthing Down</title>
		<content>Farthing Down is a {hilly area}, 147   
metres above sea level. It is found    
between Coulsdon and Chipstead.Farthing
Down is used as a {public open space}  
by local people of all ages.The Down   
is used for such activities as         
birdwatching, jogging, horse riding,   
picnics,dog walking and nature study.  
There is a cafe which sells drinks     
and sweets. Farthing Down is also of   
{archaeological interest}, as it has a 
Saxon Cemetery. Celtic field patterns  
have been found there too, and their   
remains can still be seen today. Part  
of the Downs has been set aside as a   
{Nature Trail}. When we followed the   
trail, we saw an ancient hedgerow which
we dated back to Saxon times and an    
area of beech trees called'The         
Folly'.We saw {many birds}, such as    
magpies, greenfinches, collared doves,a
kestrel, swifts and skylarks.          </content>
