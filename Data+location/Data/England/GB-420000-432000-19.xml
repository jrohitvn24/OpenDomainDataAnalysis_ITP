		<title>19PUDSEY SHOW</title>
		<content>    Pudsey Show takes place every year 
 on the second Saturday in July at     
 Grange Park.The first was held in 1949
 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of  
 Pudsey being granted a charter.People 
 show their animals and can enter in   
 the handicraft,horticulture,baking or 
 flower-arranging sections.Other       
 attractions usually include a fair-   
 ground,refreshments,shire horses,pony 
 rides and trade stands.This year's    
 entertainment was provided by the West
 Yorkshire Metropolitan Police Pipe    
 Band and the 68th Durham Light        
 Infantry who enacted a battle.        
    Most work is done voluntarily to   
 keep down the cost of admission - Â£1  
 for adults and 50p for children.Most  
 of the profit goes to local charities 
 who help out at the show.The show is  
 proof that the people of Pudsey want  
 to keep its traditions alive.         </content>
