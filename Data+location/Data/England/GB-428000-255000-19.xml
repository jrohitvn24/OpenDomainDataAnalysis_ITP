		<content> Woozeley Brook meanders through the   
 parishes of Newbold Pacey and Ashorne.
 Mostly it is about 2 metres wide and  
 a half metre deep with a muddy bed.   
 It is flanked by high hedges of       
 hawthorn, willow, crab apple, hazel,  
 blackberry and elderberry. The life in
 the stream consists of sticklebacks,  
 minnows, bullheads, water snails and  
 beetles. Watervoles can be seen       
 swimming dodging the nests of         
 morehens. In the summer dragonflies   
 dart about.The occasional grass snake 
 slithers along the grassy banks.      
 Many birds can be seen. Pigeons,      
 crows, and rooks being the most       
 common.Thrushes and robins are        
 declining but we still see lots of    
 blue tits,great tits and members of   
 the finch family. Lapwings have nested
 this season after many years of being 
 threatened by chemicals from farming. </content>
