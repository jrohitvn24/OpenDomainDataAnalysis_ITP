		<content> The Church of St.Andrews is in a very 
 bad state and was in danger of being  
 knocked down. It is being restored    
 very drastically at this moment.Such a
  very beautiful, 13th Century         
 Church,with a Chancel window of 14th  
 Century stained glass and a lovely    
 Norman font of Hurdwick stone, (one of
 only ten in the country)is a          
 magnificent possession for a small    
 village.No wonder every effort has    
 been made by a village united in its  
 aim to preserve it's heritage.        
   So the parishioners must bear the   
 inconvenience of a cement and sand    
 strewn Churchyard,builders with their 
 plastic sheets and scaffolding and,the
 greatest deprivation of all:they      
 cannot use their own Church for       
 services but have to be accommodated  
 in the Methodist Chapel .
