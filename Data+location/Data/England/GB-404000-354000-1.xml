		<title>01Onecote and Butterton area</title>
		<content>     This area is just in the Peak     
District National Park and is a        
beautiful area attracting tourists,    
mainly daytrippers.                    
     The area is a designated low      
flying area, and visitors may be       
surprised by low-flying planes flying  
quickly and noisily overhead, but the  
residents become used to them.         
     There are two villages in the area
- Onecote, with the River Hamps flowing
through it is on the Cheadle to Buxton 
road and Butterton, a quiet village    
with the Hoo Brook running through it, 
creating a ford.                       
     There is a small piece of land on 
Grindon Moor which is owned by the     
National Trust and is preserved as     
heather moorland.                      
     Most of the housing in the area is
built of local stone, either sandstone 
or limestone.                          </content>
