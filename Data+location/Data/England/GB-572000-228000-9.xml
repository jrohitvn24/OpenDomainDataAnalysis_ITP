{     Peter French}is a graphical      
 designer. Most of his work is         
 reproduced. Some of his drawings are  
 used for postcards. It takes him      
 half a day to do a postcard drawing   
 and a few days to complete a large    
 drawing.{                             
{                                      
{     Ashley Bryant}has been painting  
 all his life. He very recently gave up
 his full time job to become a         
 professional water colour artist. He  
 aims to do ten pictures a week but a  
 picture with a lot of detail can take 
 three twelve-hour days. An exhibition 
 of his work was held at the           
{Finchingfield Guild Hall}in July 1985.
 He is soon to start organising and    
 teaching local classes.
