		<title>19A Man With A Hobby</title>
		<content> There is a gentleman who lives in  our
 area who has a special{hobby}which    
 started 30years ago;{photography. }   
 Although the first slide was taken in 
 Egypt it was a relative of his wife   
 who wanted 6 picture postcards of     
 Tickhill{streets}making into{slides.} 
 Now there are around 4,600 Tickhill   
 slides some from 1897 pictures.  Over 
 the years,whenever a part of Tickhill 
 has changed,our friend has dashed out 
 to{record}for all time what happened. 
 The early cost of 12 slides was 18p   
 (3s.6d)now 36 slides cost Â£6.60.      
 Today this hobby means a treat of{film
{shows}for the people of Tickhill.They 
 are given for the benefit of local and
 distant charities.All functions are   
 well received and{enjoyed by all.}250 
 slides are the most one can absorb per
 session.                              
                                       </content>
