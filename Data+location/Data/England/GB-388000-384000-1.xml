		<title>01HOUSING IN BRAMHALL.</title>
		<content> The average house has 3 bedrooms, a   
 bathroom, a kitchen, a lounge room and
 a dining room; often attached to the  
 lounge room.  Bigger houses might     
 have another toilet, a second lounge, 
 a fourth bedroom or study, and a      
 laundry. It is quite common to have a 
 loft in the roof, which can be used   
 as a room. Most houses are two        
 storeys. Cloak cupboards are very     
 common, usually under the stairs.     
 There are a lot of semi-detached and  
 terraced houses.  Houses have a t.v.  
 set, a refrigerator, an oven and a    
 washing machine. A lot of houses also 
 have a video, tumble dryer, a         
 dishwasher, and a home computer.  Most
 of the houses are fairly old, some    
 with bay windows, lead lighting, and  
 open fireplaces, but Bramhall also has
 a couple of estates of modern houses.
