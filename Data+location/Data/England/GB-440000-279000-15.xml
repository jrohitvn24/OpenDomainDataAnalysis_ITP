 very old and more modern housing.Many 
 houses built along Broad St.and The   
 Crescent and around small cobbled     
 yards leading from these two roads are
 pre-1700 with the 2 oldest houses     
 being situated on the corner of Ell   
 Lane.Some houses have been built by   
 the council for their tenants but many
 of these are now owner-occupied.The   
 terraced and semi-detached houses in  
 Coventry Rd.,Heath Lane and Yew Tree  
 Hill were built in the 1930s,while    
 those in Great Balance,Skipwith Close 
 and George Birch Close were built in  
 the early 1970s.Potters Close         
 contains some pre-fabs. built in
