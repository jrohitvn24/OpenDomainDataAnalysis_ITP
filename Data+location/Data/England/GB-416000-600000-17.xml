		<title>17The old Catholic school.</title>
		<content> Today we went to the old Catholic     
 school.There was a large bell hanging 
 outside the porch.There were two      
 classrooms and about 30 children      
 attended.It was built in 1872.It      
 closed 15 years ago.There was a cross 
 on the roof of the schoolhouse.The    
 toilets were outside.There were open  
 fires in the classrooms and there was 
 a window inside between the classrooms
 so that the nuns could look through.  
 The nuns who taught there stayed in   
 the schoolhouse during the week and   
 went home to the Alnwick Convent for  
 the weekend.There are two very old    
 apple trees in the garden.The building
 is now a private house and a furniture
 showroom.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
