		<title>08Gosport Farm - a visit</title>
		<content>{Gosport Farm}At Gosport Farm we were  
 introduced to Mr. Pollard who gave us 
 lots of information about his work,   
 looking after the cows. He explained  
 the methods of ear tagging and        
 branding for identification. Milking  
 is done by machine and 25-30 litres of
 milk is produced per cow. All the milk
 is taken by the Milk Marketing Board. 
 The bull 'William' is valued at Â£1,000
 and his calves sell at Â£200 each. As  
 on most farms, grass acreage is used  
 to produce silage for winter feeding. 
 About 500 tonnes can be produced from 
 59 acres. Gosport Farm covers 280     
 acres which has to be cut during fine 
 weather or it wont keep.The farmhouse,
 built in Queen Anne's time, was       
 originally built as an inn in the     
 1700's and then converted to its      
 present use at a later date.
