		<content> Camblesforth County Primary School.   
                                       
 I have attended Camblesforth          
 C.P.School for 3 years. The           
 Headteacher is Mr Scott who teaches   
 first and second year Juniors. The    
 Deputy Head is Mr Smit who teaches the
 largest class of 34 third and fourth  
 year Juniors. The Infants are taught  
 by Mrs Kell and Mrs Hill. Mrs Sykes is
 our part-time teacher and is at school
 for 9 hours a week. The school has    
 about 100 pupils aged from 4 to 11.   
 School starts at 9.00 and ends at 3.15
 for the Infants and 3.45 for the      
 Juniors. There are various activities 
 in school : computer, recorders,      
 gymnastics, guitar, book club,        
 football, netball, cricket, athletics.
 The school has a very supportive      
 Parent Teachers Association which     
 helps provide money for the school.   </content>
