		<title>03A FARM AT APPELBY</title>
		<content>    The farm is heavily mechanised     
 having a large combined harvester with
 an 18ft bed, a large four wheel drive 
 tractor of 160h.p., several smaller   
 tractors of 100h.p. or so, a fork lift
 tractor for moving palletised loads,  
 sugar beet and potato harvesters etc. 
 The farm workers are{skilled craftsmen
 and the ratio is about one man to 200 
 acres.                                
    Over the years trees have been     
 felled and have fallen down and around
 1980 all the{elm trees}caught a fatal 
 disease said to originate in Holand.  
 So to replace these, a number of trees
 have been planted this year along road
 sides and hedge sides. The thorn edges
 are trimmed mechanically after July   
 1st each year in order to have a      
 growth period also to allow wild birds
 such as{partridges}to hatch out       
 unmolested.                           </content>
