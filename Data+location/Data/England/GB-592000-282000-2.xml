		<content>   There are 2 possible{origins of the 
{name Brettenham:}The 1st is 'BRETTAS',
 which means British or Native 'HAM',  
 which means settlement. The second is 
 that 'BRET' is a family name from old 
 Norse or Danish, which means 'bent    
 back', perhaps referring to a         
 deformity in the bearer of the name.  
                                       
   Shadwell has a handful of{cottages  
{inside the park,}a{well}named St.     
 Chad's, once used by{pilgrims,}a{flint
{grotto}with a{spring,}and a fine{19th 
{Century house}built by J J Teulon in  
 the grounds.                          
                                       
   Peddars Way is a Roman road. It runs
 from the NW Norfolk coast to the      
 Suffolk border, passing through       
 Brettenham. In 1907 remains perhaps of
 a soldiers' burial place were found to
 the west of the road at Brettenham.   </content>
