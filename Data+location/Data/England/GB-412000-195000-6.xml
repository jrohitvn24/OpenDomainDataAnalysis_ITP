		<title>06VILLAGE OF CASTLE EATON</title>
		<content>  A{Wiltshire}village of about 70      
 houses alongside four roads forming a 
 narrow oblong with outlying farms both
 arable and dairy. There is a Post     
 Office/General Store, an inn ("the Red
 Lion"), and a church. The housing     
 consists of slate roofed, stone       
 cottages (mostly modernised), infilled
 with post 1950 reconstituted stone,   
 tiled houses plus large houses and    
 four old people's bungalows. The only 
 red-brick building are the inn, a     
 private dwelling and some farm        
 stables. The small village hall is    
 made of corrugated iron. The school is
 closed but there is a small macadam   
 play area with swings etc. The{River  
{Thames}flows parallel to the line of  
 the village. 50% commute to work; 8%  
 are retired. The main local work is   
 farming.                              
                                       </content>
