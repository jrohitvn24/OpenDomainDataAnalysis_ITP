		<title>01The Hellesdon Area</title>
		<content>  The area is bounded by Upper         
Hellesdon in S, Old Catton to E,       
outskirts of Spixworth to NE and       
Horsham St Faiths village in NW. Most  
of Upper Hellesdon is residential with 
the suburban ribbon development        
typical of the 50's/60's,a large part  
of which is bungalows.Many of them     
have loft conversions to increase the  
accomodation for young families.Old    
Catton village has a distinctive       
centre with the church of St.Margarets 
and older buildings like Catton Hall.  
  The airport with the industrial      
estate covers about one-third of the   
total region.There is a considerable   
amount of arable farming around the    
villages of Horsham and Spixworth.The  
main A140 Norwich to Cromer road runs  
NW-SE through the area. Hellesdon's    
population is estimated at 15000, and  
there is little room for expansion!    </content>
