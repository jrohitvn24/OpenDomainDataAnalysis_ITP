		<title>10The Moorland Hall.</title>
		<content> The Moorland Hall was founded by      
 ex-service men and their friends in   
 1934. The Silver Jubilee was in 1935. 
                                       
 The hall is 35 metres by 14 metres and
 is made of rendered stone. It is      
 painted a creamy colour and the inside
 is white.                             
                                       
 The rooms are the kitchen, billiard   
 room, store room, changing rooms and  
 the main hall that is used for        
 different clubs. The toilets are in   
 the extension.                        
                                       
 The Moorland Hall has a car park and  
 is beside the main road.
