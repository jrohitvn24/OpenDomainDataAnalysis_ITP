		<title>11GT.YARMOUTH-NORWICH RAILWAY</title>
		<content>   Although the railway system of      
 South-East Norfolk suffered drastic   
 cuts under the 'Beeching Axe' it still
 provides a useful,if somewhat un-     
 economic service.The line from Great  
 Yarmouth to Norwich via Reedham       
 follows an interesting and scenic     
 route.The single track is safe-guarded
 by a token which the train driver must
 collect as his authority for right of 
 way.Passengers pay their single fare  
 of about Â£1.50 on the train.From      
 Yarmouth the line runs along the North
 shore of Breydon Water and close to   
 the R.Yare to Reedham.Here it joins   
 the Lowestoft-Norwich line.Trains     
 usually consist of two diesel driven  
 carriages.
