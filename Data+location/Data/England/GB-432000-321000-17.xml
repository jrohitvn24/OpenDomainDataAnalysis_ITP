		<title>17TREES AT CARVERS ROCKS</title>
		<content>   At Carvers Rocks there is an old    
 wood about three hundred years old on 
 one side of the reservoir and a new   
 part that is fifty years old on the   
 other side. In the new wood there are 
 all{Silver Birch}trees. They can grow 
 up to 24 metres high.{Silver Birches  
 like to grow in damp soil.            
   In the old wood there are all       
 different types of trees. There are   
{Oak}trees,{Silver Birches, Rowan}trees
 and{Hazels.}Also we saw an{Aspen}which
 is related to the Poplar tree. It     
 makes a shivering sound. It was       
 growing next to a{Mountain Ash}or     
{Rowan.}It is very rare in South       
 Derbyshire.                           
   The{Hazel}is normally a small tree  
 but it can become quite big. In       
 Carvers Rocks there were lots of      
 shells on the floor. They had been    
 eaten by mice, squirrels or birds.    </content>
