		<title>05Whittlesford Doctors Surgery</title>
		<content> A decision was made early in 1985, by 
 the{Family Practitioner Committee}to  
 close the surgery in Campion Close,   
 North Road. The Committee arranged a  
 closure date with the doctors. The    
 patients were notified of this        
 arrangement and have the opportunity  
 of going to another surgery. The      
{Whittlesford Parish Council}Chairman  
 contacted the{Family Practitioner     
{Committee}to discuss the possibility  
 of vacancies at the{Shelford Health   
{Centre Practice.}Help with the        
 provision of transport to{Sawston}was 
 also sought. The Parish Council Clerk 
 contacted Cambus about the provision  
 of a bus link between Whittlesford and
 Sawston. There is now a 'For Sale'    
 sign outside the village surgery.
