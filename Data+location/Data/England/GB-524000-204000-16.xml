		<title>16Police in Brookmans Park</title>
		<content>    We have our own village  policeman,
 who rides around the area on his      
 bicycle. He often comes into school   
 and this term he has been giving talks
 to the fourth year juniors on the work
 of the police force. Everybody knows  
 him. He helps to run the Youth Centre 
 and takes part in any pantomimes or   
 musicals that are put on in the       
 village.                              
    As there are many expensive houses 
 in the village they are all fitted    
 with burglar alarms but there are     
 still many robberies. In June 1985 a  
 petrol filling station on the A1000   
 was robbed and the attendant was      
 driven away as a hostage. Two months  
 earlier a newsagent was robbed by two 
 youths who escaped in a car. The      
 policeman asks people to keep an eye  
 on each other's houses. This is the   
 local neighbourly watch campaign.     </content>
