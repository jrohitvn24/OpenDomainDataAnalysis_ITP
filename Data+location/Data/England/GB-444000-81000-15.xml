		<content> The B3323 links this area with Newport
 and joins with the B3399 to link up   
 with the other villages of the south  
 Wight. Minor roads lead off from the  
 B3399 to the military road, the A3055.
 The minor roads are in a poor state of
 repair-some of them have not yet been 
 completely repaired since they were   
 damaged in the bad winter of '81/'82. 
 All roads on the Island are regarded  
 by tourists as being of inferior      
 quality to mainland roads. They are   
 very bumpy.
