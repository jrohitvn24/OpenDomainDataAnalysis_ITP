		<title>14MY HOUSE IN LOWDHAM.</title>
		<content>   My house is very unusual because it 
 is one of the oldest houses in Lowdham
 village.It was built about three      
 hundred years ago.                    
   It used to be a public house called 
 The White Lion.In fact,The White Lion 
 Public House is listed in an old book 
 called 'Wright's Directory' which was 
 printed in 1868.                      
   Inside the house there are still    
 hooks in the kitchen where they used  
 to hang meat.In the loft there is a   
 room where the owner used to do his   
 work.                                 
   Outside there is a little passage   
 down the side of the house.Up at the  
 top of the garden there are lots of   
 trees where we hide and play games.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
