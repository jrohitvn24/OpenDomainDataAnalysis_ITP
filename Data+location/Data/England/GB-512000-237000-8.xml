 Shefford Brownies.There are 22        
 Brownies in our pack.We are split into
 groups called Gnomes,Pixies,Elves and 
 Kelpies.                              
    We go to "Brownies" on a Thursday  
 evening from 6 p.m. until 7.15 p.m. at
 the Church Hall in Shefford.We were a 
 brown dress, a brown purse, a brown   
 bobble hat and a yellow tie.On our tie
 is our promise badge to show that the 
 wearer is a Brownie.                  
    You must be Just over 7 years old  
 to join the Brownies and you have to  
 leave when you are 10 years old.      
     At "Brownies" we work for our     
 badges but we also play games and make
 things.We try to do at least one good 
 turn every day.
