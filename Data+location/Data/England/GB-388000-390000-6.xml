		<title>06THE M63 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> The Stockport extension to the M63 was
 opened in 1982. It cost Â£26m, and is  
 2.6 miles long. This section of the   
 motorway was built to relieve traffic 
 congestion in the Cheadle Heath area. 
                                       
 During construction the engineers had 
 many problems to overcome. These      
 included: re-routing the R. Mersey,   
 builing temporary road bridges for    
 Wellington Rd and Lancashire Hill,    
 putting the motorway under the viaduct
 and building a retaining wall with    
 rock anchors to contain the fluvio-   
 glacial material upon which St Mary's 
 church stands.                        
                                       
 Since its opening a number of         
 developments have taken place near the
 M63: the building of B&amp;Q superstore,  
 the Sainsbury and Asda development at 
 Warren St and Orbro Cash and Carry.   </content>
