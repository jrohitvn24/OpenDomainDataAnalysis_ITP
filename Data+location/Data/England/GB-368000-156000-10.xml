		<title>10CHILDRENS' GAMES- 1</title>
		<content> Many of the old playground games are  
 still used in village schools,        
 especially as rhythm songs and chants 
 for skipping. However it has become   
 very noticable that the words, and in 
 some cases the tunes, are changing as 
 a direct result of the influence of TV
 commercials. The actual rhymes used in
 skipping and  circle games vary from  
 village to village and, indeed, from  
 one generation of schoolchildren to   
 the next in any particular community. 
 Tag games are legion as they always   
 have been. Variations of basic tag    
 games are given separate names and in 
 recent years tag games based on video 
 and computer software have appeared.
