		<content> Belford Hall is a grade 2* listed     
 building.                             
 It was built in 1756 by James Payne   
 for a Newcastle merchant named Abraham
 Dixon.It is built in the classical    
 style (Palladian) from local yellow   
 sandstone.It ceased to be a family    
 home in the 1930's and was used as    
 billeting accomodation for troops     
 during World War 2, after which it was
 neglected and allowed to decay.The    
 Hall was bought by quarry owners      
 McLaren of Belford, and in 1983       
 acquired by English Heritage for      
 restoration and alteration to the     
 interior to provide 17 houses and     
 flats.The rolling pasture fronting the
 Hall is being retained in its original
 setting with aged hardwood trees being
 replaced.
