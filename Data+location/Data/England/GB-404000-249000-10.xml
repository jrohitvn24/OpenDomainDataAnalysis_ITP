		<title>10A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ZOE</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up go downstairs 
 and have my breakfast, which is       
 usually cornflakes and milk.          
    After my breakfast I go upstairs   
 and get dressed. If I have to go to   
 school I wear my school uniform which 
 for girls is a grey skirt, white      
 blouse, maroon jumper and a maroon    
 tie.                                  
   After I am dressed I go upstairs    
 and have a wash and then I go to      
 school.At playtime I play with my     
 friends.                              
  In class my best subject is English  
 and maths is my least favourite.At    
 half past three I come home from      
 school. When I get home I go upstairs 
 and get changed. I then go downstairs 
 and have my tea, which is usually     
 chips or salad.After tea I go to play 
 on the playing field or watch some    
 television. Then I go to bed.         </content>
