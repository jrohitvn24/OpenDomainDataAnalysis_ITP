		<content> In 1895 Seaton Sluice consisted of    
 these places: Bottlework Square,      
 Delaval Street, Market Place, Long    
 Street, Short Street, Hussey Street,  
 Sandy Island, Rocky Island.           
   Children left school at 13 years old
 and started work at the pit, They     
 worked at the pit at Seaton Sluice    
 until 65 years old. Whilst they were  
 at school the children had no games   
 lessons, woodwork or metalwork, all   
 the did was Maths, Reading, Writing   
 and R.E. Due to the lack of sport     
 after school hours all they did was   
 play games like football, marbles,    
 tops and whips, mount the cuddy and   
 hoops. The old people have seen many  
 changes in the Sluice including the   
 bottleworks, harbour bridge, graffitti
 and most of all, the size of the      
 village.
