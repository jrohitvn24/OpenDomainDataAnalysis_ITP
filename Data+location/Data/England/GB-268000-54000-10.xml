		<title>10HISTORY OF NORTH HUISH</title>
		<content> There is a wealth of history in the   
 sector, some of it rather obscure, due
 to lack of recording facilities in the
 past.  Notable families once resided  
 here, leaving much information for    
 dedicated students to research, given 
 time and opportunity. {Archives}at    
 Exeter and Dartington are open to     
 anyone seriously intent on studying or
 recording it.  The school and school- 
 house have both disappeared but       
 records of both probably exist in the 
 Archives, or in the records held by   
 some local families. There were once  
 quarries, possibly slate yielding.    
 Many of the houses are steeped in     
 history, but little researched or     
 publicised. Four {SAXON  ESTATES}were 
 listed in the FIRST DOMESDAY BOOK.    
 UGBOROUGH has a ruined{Mediaeval      
{Mansion}and a contemporary farmhouse  
 once incorporated another.            </content>
