		<title>17FLOOD DITCH, CHRISTCHURCH.</title>
		<content>   OFF BARRACK ROAD THERE IS A BIG     
 FIELD.  PEOPLE WALK THEIR DOGS THERE. 
 THE WORKMAN HAS JUST DUG A GREAT BIG  
 FLOOD DITCH AS THERE IS A RIVER       
 NEAR-BY.  THE DITCH IS VERY DEEP AND  
 PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING THAT IT IS VERY
 DANGEROUS.  THE PAPERS ARE ALSO       
 COMPLAINING.  THE DITCH IS USED AS A  
 RUBBISH BIN AS IT IS FULL OF SWEET    
 WRAPPERS AND CRISP PACKETS.  THIS     
 FLOOD DITCH HAS BEEN DUG ALL THE WAY  
 ROUND THE FIELD AND IT TOOK NEARLY TWO
 WEEKS TO BUILD.  NEAR-BY THEY ARE     
 PUTTING IN HUGE STONE PIPES TO HELP   
 STOP THE FLOODING.  THE DITCH IS      
 PARTLY FULL OF WATER.  THERE HAS NOT  
 BEEN A FLOOD FOR A LONG TIME.  EVEN   
 THOUGH THERE IS A BIG FLOOD DITCH     
 RIGHT ROUND THE FIELD PEOPLE CAN STILL
 GET TO IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BUILT A   
 SMALL BRIDGE ACROSS THE DITCH.
