		<content>   Survey done by 30 children about    
 religion in Tockwith.                 
   In our block there are 3 places of  
 worship. In Tockwith there is the     
 Church of the Epiphany and the        
 Methodist Chapel. In Bilton-in-Ainsty 
 is St. Helen's Church of England.     
 Previously, Bickerton and Bilton had  
 Methodist Chapels. Of 30 children,    
 Penny goes to Tockwith CE Church      
 weekly; no-one goes to Bilton Church; 
 Jennifer and Jill go to Tockwith      
 Methodist Chapel weekly. 6 children go
 to church or chapel once or twice a   
 year on special occasions like        
 Christmas Day. 3 children go to Sunday
 School. Paul Wilson wrote "Our family 
 goes to church once or twice a year.  
 My parents do not encourage me to go  
 more often. Normally they have a lie  
 in on Sunday morning, they are not    
 interested in going.                  </content>
