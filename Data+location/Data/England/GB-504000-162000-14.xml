		<content>   The Surrey Herald is a local weekly 
 newspaper founded in 1892. It has 18  
 reporters of whom six are based in    
 Chertsey, six in Walton and six in    
 Staines. There are four photographers 
 and eighty other staff, including     
 printers, typesetters and editors. The
 Herald circulates 33,000 copies each  
 week in Walton, Weybridge, Chertsey   
 and Addlestone where nine out of ten  
 people buy the paper.                 
    The Herald sees itself as an       
 organisation to fight readers' battles
 and there is usually a good response. 
 It also promotes local business by    
 advertising. There is even a          
 children's section of the paper: the  
 Professor Bullseye Club which has over
 5,000 members.
