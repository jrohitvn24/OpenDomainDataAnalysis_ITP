		<title>06Meadowend Kennels, Guide.</title>
		<content>   Meadowend is a Boarding Kennels,    
 Cattery and stray dogs' home.         
 They care for all stray animals except
 birds which they take to Leighton     
 Hall.                                 
 There were about{1,100 stray dogs}in  
 1984,of which only 202 were reclaimed 
 by their owners.                      
    Lots of dogs and cats get left when
 people go on holiday. A lot of people 
 leave them because they dont like     
 paying fees.{Every day in our country 
{over 2000 dogs and cats are killed.   
   At Meadowend they have 1 donkey and 
 2 ponies but they have more which they
 have looked after elsewhere. They have
 9 dogs themselves and they have       
 adopted 3 others.                     
   Two people help when they can but   
 they don't get paid.                  
   The dogs are fed according to their 
 weight.                               </content>
