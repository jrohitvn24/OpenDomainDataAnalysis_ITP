		<content>                                       
   At 7.40am I wake up,have a shower   
 and then eat my breakfast,either a    
 cereral or a cooked meal.I then clean 
 my shoes and pack my bag ready for    
 school.My mum takes my brother and me 
 to school in the car.This is because  
 my brother has difficulties with his  
 hearing and my school has a Partially 
 Hearing Unit.We arrive at 8.40am.     
 School starts at 8.55.I usually       
 have sandwiches for lunch.At 3.30 we  
 leave school.Generally I buy some     
 sweets and then we go home.I go out to
 play and come in for a meal at 5pm.If 
 it is Friday,I go to a Youth Club near
 my house.There I play snooker, table  
 tennis and board games.At 9.30pm I go 
 home and go to bed.
