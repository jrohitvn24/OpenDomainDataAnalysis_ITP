		<title>18LAND USE IN OUR AREA</title>
		<content>   In our area the tops of hills are   
 used for grazing sheep,the middle land
 is used for growing crops.The crops   
 include Barley,Corn and hay.Sheep     
 graze the tops of our hills because   
 the grass is finer.Horses are grazed  
 throughout the area.Down near the     
 river no crops are grown because in   
 the flood season they would be spoilt.
 Houses aren't built near the river for
 the same reason.In the past trees were
 allowed to grow near the river for    
 fuel and game animals they provided.  
 Usually the big fields are used for   
 growing the crops and small fields are
 used for grazing or hay production.   
   Horrabridge is situated at the      
 crossroads between Whitchurch,        
 Samford, Yelverton &amp; Walkhamton ,on a 
 crossing point of the River Walkham.It
 is around 1/2 square kilometre in     
 area.                                 </content>
