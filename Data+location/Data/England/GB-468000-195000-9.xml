Our area is fairly flat and lies in    
the vale at the foot of the Chiltern   
Escarpment.                            
In the southern tip of the area is     
Shirburn Hill (830')and wood  which is 
part of the Chilterns.                 
There are several streams and springs  
in Pyrton and Shirburn where the water 
has drained down from the hills. In the
19th century a landscape designer      
used one of the underground streams to 
design the lake and moat system at     
Shirburn Castle. There is also a       
spring   and a moat at Pyrton Manor.   
Looking down from the hills the block  
is a patchwork of fields with the odd  
farm or cluster of houses.
