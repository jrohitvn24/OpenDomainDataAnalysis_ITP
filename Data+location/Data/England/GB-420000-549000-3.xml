		<content> EDMONDSLEY was once a ROMAN CAMP.It   
 was given to WILLIAM EDMONDSLEY by    
 WILLIAM 1 until 1382.In 1632 it was   
 given to a family called WARDELL.     
    A BRONZE_AGE shield was found in a 
 burn(stream).The parish church found  
 a STONE_AGE dish.The old school       
 celebrated 100 years in 1975 and a new
 NURSERY SCHOOL was built 7 years ago. 
    Edmondsley is not a very busy place
 and has a very good bus service.Most  
 people go to DOCTORS at SACRISTON.    
 BLACKHOUSE was built by Mr.CLAYTON in 
 the 1920's.It was demolished in 1979  
 and the people were re-housed on a new
 housing estate at EDMONDSLEY.The land 
 is now used for cropgrowing.The       
 working mens club is still used.
