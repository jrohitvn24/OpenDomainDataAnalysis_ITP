		<content>      The physical features have hardly
 changed since 1959.To the north east  
 we have housing estates.Eastwards from
 the estates there is a gentle slope   
 which ends in the flat flood plain of 
 the{River Cuckmere}.                  
      Walking southwards from the      
 estates we walk down a fairly steep   
 slope.This slope ends at the area of  
 cliffs known as {Seaford Head}.Going  
 westwards along the footpath we come  
 to{Hawk's Brow}.Here Seaford Head ends
 and the shingle beach begins.Parallel 
 to the beach is the promenade.To the  
 north of the promenade we have a built
 up area which becomes more dense as we
 walk in a northerly direction.        
      Eventually we arrive at the      
 Eastbourne Road.Here we are in the    
 most thickly built up part of our     
 area.
