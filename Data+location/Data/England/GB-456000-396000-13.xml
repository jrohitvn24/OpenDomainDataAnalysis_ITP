		<content> My grandma was born in 1921 in        
 the village of wadworth. She went to  
 school till 14 years old and when she 
 was 16 she went into private service  
 at Wilsic hall. A few years later she 
 went into a factory making silk. At   
 that time we only had one little      
 grocery shop in the village and Lucy  
 Frost owned it. Every Tuesday and     
 Saturday Mr. Sackston would go to the 
 village of Tickhill and get her any   
 things she wanted. He would come with 
 the delivery on a horse and cart. On  
 the 22 of December 1945 remarried at  
 Wadworth church and lived at the      
 second cottage in High street. Three  
 years later she got married again on  
 March sixth 1948 at the church. The   
 vicar was M.T. Sanderson. Then she    
 lived at 32 church view now she lives 
 alone at 14 Ratten Row both husbands
