		<title>01SURVEY OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> The majority of this block is within  
 the Borough of Solihull. A small part 
 on the southern edge is in            
 Warwickshire. This is a rural area    
 with just two small settlements; the  
 village of Chadwick End which is on   
 the main Birmingham-Warwick road and a
 small group of houses at Fen End. Part
 of Temple Balsall is also in the      
 block. The nearest main village is    
 Balsall Common which is just above the
 north-eastern edge of the block.      
 At Fen End there is an old RAF        
 airstrip which is now used by Lucas as
 a test track. The houses their now    
 form a small council estate. Most of  
 the land is used for growing crops and
 as pasture land. The fields are often 
 very small and criss-crossed with     
 drainage ditches. The pasture is not  
 of very good quality.
