		<content>   Wheat and barley were quite         
 frequently                            
 seen as were crops such potatoes and  
 turnips. Acreage ranged from          
 three-quarters up to two hundred and  
 fifty acres. Most of the farms were   
 quite highly machanised, point 3-4    
 using the given scale.There was only  
 one small farm using only the minimum 
 source of mechanisation. We also found
 a farm breeding race horses which was 
 the only one of its kind within the   
 area.                                 
 Occupations were as so :              
                                       
                Houswives      = 10    
                Doctors        =  2    
                Nurse          =  1    
                Wordproccessor =  1    
               Factory foreman =  1    
                Retired        =  9    
                                       </content>
