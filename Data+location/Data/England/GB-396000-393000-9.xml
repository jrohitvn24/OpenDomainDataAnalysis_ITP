		<title>09 THE MOTTRAM ARTIST</title>
		<content>    Overlooking Hattersley is the      
imposing Mottram Church which nods to  
its tiny village and watches carefully 
over Hattersley.                       
    The most famous occupant of Mottram
is L.S.Lowry, the artist who painted   
local industrial scenes and matchstick 
men. The house he lived in is being    
sold but the memory of the old artist  
lingers.  The local people in the      
entire area are very proud of him.     
    Before he died a local doctor and  
his wife visited him at his house.     
During the conversation he said "Do you
think I'll be remembered in 50 years'  
time?"                                 
    "Of course you will," they said.   
    "I doubt it," said Mr Lowry.       
    His paintings are being sold for   
large amounts of money and we feel Mr  
Lowry was wrong-he will be remembered.
