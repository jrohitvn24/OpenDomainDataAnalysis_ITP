		<title>02A Patchway House and Garden</title>
		<content> My house is an end terrace.  It has   
 six rooms, the front room, kitchen,   
 hallway, bathroom, my Mum and Dad's   
 bedroom and my bedroom.  The best room
 in my house is my room.  It has pink  
 wallpaper and a pink carpet.  I am in 
 the back room.  My Mum and Dad's room 
 is twice the size of mine.  My room   
 has a lot of cupboards.  In my bedroom
 I keep my books and pads and all my   
 pens and pencils.  The next best room 
 in my house is the front room because 
 we have a television set and a fire,  
 and the best thing is a three piece   
 suite of chairs and a settee.  We have
 got patio doors leading out onto our  
 patio.  We have got the biggest garden
 in the row of houses.  We have lots of
 flowers.  We've got roses, pansies,   
 stocks, and pinks, and in our         
 greenhouse we are growing some more   
 seeds.                                </content>
