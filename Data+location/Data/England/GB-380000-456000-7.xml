		<content> When I wake up I read in bed until my 
 mum calls me at eight o'clock.I put a 
 skirt or dress on.I hardly ever wear  
 jeans.For breakfast I have toast with 
 syrup on.Then I go on the computer or 
 mess about.                           
  At halfpast eight I set off wearing a
 full length coat and black shoes.My   
 mum takes my bike down the road so    
 that I can bike up again after school.
 We wait for a  bus.It takes five      
 minutes to Long Preston.School starts 
 at nine o'clock.I play about until    
 the teachers come in.                 
  We read before we get our work out.We
 usually do Maths  before break and    
 English after break.We have break at  
 twenty to eleven.Twelve o'clock is    
 dinner time then we go outside and    
 play until one o'clock.In the         
 afternoon we do some activities.
