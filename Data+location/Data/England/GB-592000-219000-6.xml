  Sometimes P.C. Aitchinson visits     
 Birch Primary School to give talks    
 and films about{road safety.          
 When he comes to school he sometimes  
 shows us how to take fingerprints     
 and how to use the radio in his car.  
  The most common{crimes}he deals      
 with are poaching, theft of building  
 materials and household goods. If     
 serious crimes are committed he can   
 get help from the C.I.D, call in      
 police dogs and fingerprint experts.
