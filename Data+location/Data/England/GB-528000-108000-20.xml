		<title>20WILDLIFE ON THE DOWNS</title>
		<content> We saw lots of minibeasts on our      
 walk.There were ants on the ground and
 a worm in the mud. Somebody turned    
 over a big stone. Underneath we found 
 lots of woodlice, an earwig and       
 centipede.In the long grass there     
 were ladybirds and a grass-hopper. We 
 saw a slug and lots of banded snails  
 in the nettles. James saw a black     
 beetle and a cabbage white butterfly. 
 Two girls saw a spider in a web.  A   
 woodlouse has fourteen legs.  A       
 centipede has lots of legs and a      
 spider has eight legs. Snails and     
 slugs move on a muscular foot. All the
 rest are insects which have six legs. 
                                       
 Birds.                                
 On our walk we saw these birds-       
 starlings, crows, swallows, doves,    
 woodpigeons a blackbird and sparrows.
