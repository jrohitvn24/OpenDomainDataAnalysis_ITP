		<title>17THE CHURCH, LUCKINGTON.</title>
		<content> St.Mary and St.Ethelbert's is the     
 local Parish Church.It was built in   
 the 12th. Century and has had many    
 alterations and additions,the latest  
 being in 1872.                        
 Since then the side chapel and chancel
 have both been completely re-built.   
 The present Vicar is also responsible 
 for the churches at Alderton,Sherston,
 Foxley and Easton Grey.Another early  
 part of the church is the bell tower  
 built in the fifteenth century.       
 The stone heads by the chancel arch   
 are those of St.Mary and St.Ethelbert.
 This year a car park was built in     
 front of the church.
