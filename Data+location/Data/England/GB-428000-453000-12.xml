		<title>12    THE VALLEY GARDENS</title>
		<content>  I go to the Valley Gardens every day 
 with my friends.I like it best in the 
 winter going down off the top of the  
 hills banging into one another.The    
 bare trees with snow on the top,and   
 people crying of cold.I put my sledge 
 on the edge of the hill and push off. 
 But in the summer it is just as good. 
 The cafe shop is open and the paddling
 pool is alive with people jumping and 
 splashing.Also in the summer I like to
 play tennis and crazy golf.But it is  
 best to look at in the autumn.When all
 leaves are falling off the trees.They 
 make a colourful carpet.I walk through
 them proudly.I stroll through the     
 greeny pine woods.The needles shine as
 I look at the sun and watch it go     
 down.                                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
