		<title>08WEST DURRINGTON ESTATE cont.</title>
		<content>    W. Durrington is a popular area.   
 The survey showed that the style and  
 price of houses and the layout of the 
 estate were the main reasons why      
 people chose to live there.  There is 
 a carefully planned variety of housing
 with most attractive open plan front  
 gardens.                              
 SHOPPING CENTRE  The hub of the estate
 is the shopping precinct with a Tesco 
 superstore and a large free carpark.  
 It serves a wide area . Out of 1500   
 shoppers questioned less than 300 were
 estate residents. 82% had driven from 
 places within a 5 mile radius but 10% 
 had travelled between 10 -15 miles.   
 AMENITIES There is a community centre 
 with a varied programme of leisure    
 activities, a youth club and          
 recreation area.  People questioned   
 thought a post office, more shops and 
 a swimming pool would be improvements.</content>
