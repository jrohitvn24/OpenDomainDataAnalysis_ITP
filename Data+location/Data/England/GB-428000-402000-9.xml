		<content> Our area is farmland and contained    
 very little litter.The houses are     
 terraced,there is an estate of        
 bungalows and an Old People's         
 Home.There are only a few public      
 houses in this area.                  
 The farmlands have crops which are    
 used for cereals,there are rough      
 grazing areas too.Some is used for    
 public footpaths which would have been
 used by the colliery workers for      
 getting to and from the colliery.The  
 countryside is spoilt by the          
 dismantled railway lines and the old  
 derelict mine.                        
 The survey ended in Hood Green,a small
 but pretty village which has not      
 suffered form litter and              
 vandalism.This is in spite of the fact
 that it is not far from Dodworth and  
 Barnsley.A village well worth a visit.
