		<title>03The Shropshire Way</title>
		<content>    Six years ago, Wem Walkers         
 decided to link several  small public 
 footpaths into one long one,to run the
 length of the county from Whitchurch  
 to Ludlow.So they wrote to all the    
 rambling clubs in Shropshire.They had 
 a meeting and decided where it would  
 go.Besides the main part, they added  
 a loop from Ludlow to Telford and     
 back to Wem. In all, the path is      
 about 200 miles long.Then they divided
 the route into blocks, so that all the
 groups could work out a bit of the    
 path.The Wem Walkers did the part from
 Whixall to Hadnall,and it goes right  
 through the middle of Wem.They made   
 and printed a guide of thirty pages.A 
 buzzard with outstretched wings is the
 waymark of the Shropshire Way.If you  
 follow the buzzard and the yellow     
 arrows you will know that you are on  
 the right track.                      </content>
