		<content>{ What I like about Frogmore.}         
                                       
 I live in Frogmore. There is an       
 estuary and a village shop. I like    
 going for walks along the fields with 
 my family and my dog. The village shop
 sells things you need and you can buy 
 stamps and post your letters. I like  
 the estuary, you can go for walks and 
 there are paths leading to the fields.
 The house which is joined on to ours  
 is my grandma and grandad's. There    
 isn't much room to ride your bikes,   
 some people ride on the road and      
 others ride them in their gardens.    
 Sometimes people move into the house  
 next door for their holidays or to    
 wait until their house they are going 
 to buy is ready. I like living in     
 Frogmore, I have lots of friends there
 and my grandma and grandad live there.
