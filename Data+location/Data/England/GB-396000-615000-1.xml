		<title>01SUMMARY OF AREA</title>
		<content> The area as a whole is dominated by   
 large tracts of moorland and one major
 valley through which flows the river  
 Breamish. The valley floor is around  
 500'. From here the land rises to     
 around 1800' with bare craggy         
 outcrops. Another notable feature is  
 the almost total lack of population.  
 The only centre of note is Linhope    
 itself only a tiny hamlet. The        
 remainder of the population is found  
 in isolated hill farms. The area is   
 one of the most  remote parts of      
 Northumberland with only one tiny road
 providing access.
