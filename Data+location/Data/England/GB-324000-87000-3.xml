		<title>03Goat Island</title>
		<content> Goat Island is the 15 acres which     
 became separated from the mainland as 
 a result of the Great Landslip of     
 1839.  A pathway through the slip     
 leads from Axmouth to Lyme Regis and  
 the walk takes approximately 4 hours. 
 The chasm now covered with dense      
 woodland has some 120 species of      
 birds, many classified as rare,       
 numerous species of plants, and       
 mammals such as Roe deer and badgers. 
 This area is an interesting geological
 feature which also provides a         
 mosaic of habitats nationwide and a   
 place for serious research.           
 Visitors are asked to follow the      
 countryside code and special written  
 permission for collecting specimens or
 leaving the public path is required   
 from the Regional Officer, NCC,       
 Roughmoor, Bishop's Hall, Taunton,    
 TA1 5AA.                              </content>
