		<title>12"A DAY IN THE LIFE OF...."</title>
		<content>   I wake first,fall downstairs and,   
 just when I think I've escaped,there  
 comes this ominous voice:"How's about 
 a cup of tea?" I scream and die, well,
 not quite. Afterwards I have a little 
 time to play JetSet Willy.  Still not 
 content my family sends me mad by     
 sending my brother to disrupt program 
 loading.  When I finally get it to    
 load my divvy brother cries if I don't
 let him have a go.  I'm just about    
 throttle him when down comes Mum for  
 the breakfast.  After that I get ready
 for school and Mum and Dad for work.  
 Maths (ARGH!) then Art (GROOVY!).     
 After school I go home and play on the
 computer or watch TV (same arguments!)
 After tea we have gerbil races up and 
 down the stairs. I'm not a good       
 sleeper and don't usually drop off    
 until half-ten.  Mum watches TV till  
 Dad returns.  So ends another day.    </content>
