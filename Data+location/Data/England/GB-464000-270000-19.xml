		<title>19Sport in our villages</title>
		<content>At our school most of the children like
to join in plenty of sport.There are   
football teams,cricket,netball and     
swimming teams,and gymnastics and      
athletics clubs in our school.We have  
played a lot of friendly matches       
against other schools,some of them we  
won and some of them we lost.          
Football is played by 11 players on a  
grassy field,cricket is also played by 
11 players per team on a grassy        
pitch,whereas netball is played by 7   
players on a tarmac area.              
In Ravensthorpe there is an adult      
football and cricket team,I like watch-
ing the matches which they play in the 
village.We normally play football in   
winter and cricket in the summer.My    
favourite sport is football,I also like
to watch the school football team and  
cheer them on.
