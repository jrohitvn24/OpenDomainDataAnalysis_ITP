		<title>16A STUBTON CHILD'S WEEKEND</title>
		<content>       My name is Peter Blackman and I 
 live in Stubton.I like my weekends. On
 Saturday I get up and get ready to go 
 to the pictures at Newark. There is a 
 competition every week, the last one  
 about who had the biggest teddy bear. 
 I go with two friends and sometimes   
 make some new friends. I either go in 
 a car or by bus.                      
       I go to a working men's club    
 on Saturday evening and there are     
 singers and my mum plays bingo. There 
 are also people who tell jokes. My dad
 gets the drinks for my mum and I have 
 a drink of shandy. I meet some        
 friends. At 11 o'clock mum, dad and I 
 go home and I get to bed at 11.30.    
       On a Sunday I go to a club at 12
 o'clock and in the afternoon I take a 
 dog for a walk around the village. On 
 Sunday evening I watch television and 
 go to bed at 9.30.                    </content>
