		<content>   Early in 1985 a local farmer decided
 to remove a hedge and trees that were 
 approximately 200 years old without   
 consulting the family whose land it   
 bordered.  Because of the age of the  
 trees it became a very controversial  
 matter and moves were made to try and 
 prevent the destruction of the whole  
 of the plants.                        
                                       
   The issue was taken up by Lord      
 Melchet who brought up the subject in 
 the House of Lords as it was closely  
 connected to the Concervation Bill.   
 Newspaper reporters took up the story 
 and a report of the affair was        
 televised.                            
                                       
    The National Farmers Union became  
 involved and the farmer decided not to
 remove the roots of the hedge so that 
 it could grow up again.               </content>
