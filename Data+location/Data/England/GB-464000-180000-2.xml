		<content>The country around Woodcote is         
relatively high {606 ft at the water   
tower},sloping away on three sides     
down to the curve of the Thames,and    
giving fine open views North and West  
to green country and the downland      
beyond.The soil is chalk with clay     
pockets ,well drained,with no rivers   
but some ponds.Much of the area is     
still covered by beautiful woodland,   
mainly beech with a little oak and     
birch and one or two coniferous        
plantations.There are several small    
farms of mixed arable and pasture.     
Woodcote itself has grown rapidly      
over the last 20 years,and is now a    
rather straggling development.One loss 
to the ecology has been most of        
Woodcote Common,which once grew wild   
to the top of Greenmoor Hill; now all  
that remains is a village green edged  
by allotments.                         </content>
