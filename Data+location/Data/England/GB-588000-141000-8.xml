		<content> Because of building restrictions and  
 changes in agriculture farm buildings 
 are now often converted: oast houses, 
 redundant now that the hop trade is   
 reduced, make attractive houses, their
 white cowls always preserved; and     
 barns are being converted here, where 
 building land is scarce. No ramshackle
 old cottages remain: dwellings once   
 inhabited by working people have been 
 restored and beautified by prosperous 
 incomers keen to live in this renowned
 village; most young local people      
 cannot afford a house in Smarden.     
 Gardens are imaginatively planned and 
 carefully maintained. The             
 prefabricated houses built by the     
 council in 1945 are bleak and         
 unattractive but the mellower brick   
 council estates now blend in with the 
 older houses.                         
                                       </content>
