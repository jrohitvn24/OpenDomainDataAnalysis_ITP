		<title>09Farming - A turkey Farm</title>
		<content>    An unusual and specialised activity
 is the production of turkey eggs for  
 hatching .The farm receives  a flock  
 of{5000 white hen turkey's}every six  
 months.They are housed in large,open  
 wooden sheds where they are fed and   
 watered automatically.The stag turkeys
 are kept in a small pen and{the hen   
{are fertilised by artificial          
{insemination.}When the flocks are     
 changed,the hen turkey's will be      
 slaughtered for meat.The eggs are sent
 for incubation to provide young       
 turkey's for the largest turkey       
 processing company in the world.There 
 are few problems with disease thanks  
 to preventive drugs.Four employers    
 work continually  in the turkey       
 units,and all living in the locality  
 of Morningthorpe.
