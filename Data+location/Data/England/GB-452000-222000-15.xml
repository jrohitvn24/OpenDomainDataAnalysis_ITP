		<content>    The village appears to have a busy 
community life.The pub,The Jersey Arms 
is the focal point.                    
    The church organises a musical     
group and days out.                    
    To keep the village spirit alive a 
village concert is organised each      
christmas and also a christmas bazaar, 
a harvest supper and occasional fetes  
are held.                              
    The local cricket club have their  
grounds in the estate in a real olde   
English setting.                       
    As the population is small, many   
people travel to partake in group and  
sports activities, for example, Womens 
Institute to Bicester or Stoke Lyne;   
Scouts,Brownies etc to Chesterton;     
Bicester and Ploughley sports centre   
and also Oxford.
