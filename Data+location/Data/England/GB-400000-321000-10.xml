		<title>10Life on Coley Farm, Colwich</title>
		<content>                                       
The farmer at Far Coley starts work at 
7.00 each day. He has a full time      
employee and a part time employee. The 
father of the farmer still owns the    
farm but no longer lives there. He     
spends some time each day at the farm  
taking care of all the paper work. Each
day the cows are milked twice, and jobs
concerned with caring for the herd are 
undertaken every day of the year. These
jobs include milking, cleaning out,    
feeding, bedding the calves and        
checking the cycles in order that      
insemination can be carried out at the 
correct time. The rest of the time is  
used for maintenance of hedges, fences 
machinery and woodland. The farmer also
has to plough and fertilize the land,  
and sow and spray the crops. Harvesting
is contracted out. He also has grass   
to mow and store for silage.           </content>
