		<title>11Young people in Bookham</title>
		<content> For the young, Bookham has the        
 advantage of easy rail links to London
 and open countryside a few minutes'   
 walk from the High Street. Schools in 
 the area have high standards with     
 better than average exam results      
 providing opportunities for higher    
 education which many take up.         
                                       
 Being a dormitory area with no real   
 industry of its own, the villages     
 provide little employment for the     
 young and inexperienced.              
                                       
 Roteract and Pose are young people's  
 groups and some of the churches have  
 youth groups. There appears to be a   
 divide between the older inhabitants  
 and the young, with little opportunity
 for them to mix socially. Students on 
 holiday and the young unemployed find 
 little to do in Bookham.              </content>
