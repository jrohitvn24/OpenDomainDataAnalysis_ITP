		<title>20OUR DOMESDAY TAPESTRY</title>
		<content>   When we were finding out about Will-
 iam The Conqueror and the original    
 Domesday Book we looked at pictures of
 the Bayeux Tapestry.One teacher said  
 as a joke that we ought to make one   
 ourselves.We decided to go ahead with 
 the suggestion.We used the information
 and sketches from our Domesday project
 research and worked out the subjects. 
 We worked in thirteen groups of four &amp;
 made a panel each.Each panel shows a  
 fomous landmark in Maldon.We had to   
 plan it carefully.We sewed the back-  
 ground on first using an electric sew-
 ing machine.We built up our pictures  
 using different kinds of materials.We 
 all worked hard on our tapestry and we
 are all very proud of it.It is hanging
 in the entrance of our school,Maldon  
 County Primary and is now part of our 
 memories of 1985.
