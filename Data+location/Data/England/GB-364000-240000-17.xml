		<title>17ASHPERTON : NEW SETTLERS</title>
		<content> All families in this development have 
 been in the village between 3 and 4   
 years. Coming from Birmingham and the 
 West Midlands mainly, with some from  
 London, the North of England and      
 South Wales. There is an average of   
 one person employed in each household 
 in work ranging across electronic     
 engineer designer, teacher and        
 builder. Every household has the use  
 of a car _ in fact 1.6 cars per       
 household. They travel up to a radius 
 of twenty miles around the village.   
 They use Ledbury as a market town  but
 the trend is to by_pass Ledbury and   
 use Hereford. In looking at ages, it  
 was found that a third of the people  
 were in the oldest age group. This is 
 partly because the price of these new 
 houses has put them out of the reach  
 of many younger families.
