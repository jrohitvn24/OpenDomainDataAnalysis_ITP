  There are two postal collections and 
 one delivery from Monday to Friday    
 with one collection and delivery on   
 Saturdays. The postcode is Ipswich    
 based, and the postal town is         
 Halesworth.                           
  More than half the households are on 
 the telephone. From a distance of     
 about 30km the Subscriber Trunk       
 Dialling Code is 098683.              
  Village events are advertised on two 
 official notice boards in the village,
 in the shop and the church porch. They
 will also be found in the Community   
 News and Church magazine.             
  Word of mouth remains the fastest, if
 not the most accurate means of        
 communication.
