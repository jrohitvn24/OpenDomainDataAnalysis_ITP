		<title>06New Shopping Complex, Corby</title>
		<content>A multi-million pound shopping,        
leisure hotel and office complex that  
when complete could create 1200 new    
jobs in Corby is planned to get under  
way in the second half of 1985. To be  
built on the cleared site of the steel-
works the thirty to fifty million pound
development is a combined operation by 
local agents, architects, builders,    
surveyors and the Corby District       
Council.                               
The new centre will be made up of a    
superstore, DIY warehouse, furniture\  
carpet store, twelve shopping units,   
offices, a public house and restaurant,
a garden centre, a hotel and conference
centre, a petrol station and an        
entertainment complex. The first phase 
costing ten million has just been      
started with a view to opening an Asda 
hypermarket before Christmas next year.
A new road to the site is complete.    </content>
