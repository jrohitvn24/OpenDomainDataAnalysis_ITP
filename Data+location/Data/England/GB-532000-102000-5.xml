		<content> The Trevor Mann baby unit provides    
 special facilities for the care of    
 babies in the nurseries, each with    
 places for 7 cots and incubators.     
 There is also a lounge for mothers.   
 Visitors have to wear special gowns   
 before entering the unit for reasons  
 of cleanliness. Babies can survive at 
 this hospital up to three months      
 premature. A #26,000 scanning machine 
 detects brain damage of any sort in   
 the baby. Money was raised for the    
 scanner and presented to the unit.    
 It compares extremely favourably with 
 other such units in England.          
       The heart unit does not deal    
 with open heart surgery as this is    
 carried out at King's College Hospital
 in London but it was one of the first 
 units to introduce special life saving
 equipment in their cardiac ambulances.
