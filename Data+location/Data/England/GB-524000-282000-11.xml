		<title>11COMMON FARM</title>
		<content> At Kate's farm they deal in crops but 
 they also keep pigs. The sows and     
 boars are kept separate. The sows are 
 taken to the sow vans to have their   
 babies. The pens are specially made so
 that the sows can't lie on their      
 babies by mistake. Mr. Halden has to  
 pull the piglets' baby teeth out so   
 that when they feed they don't make   
 the mother sore or hurt one another   
 when they're playing. He also has to  
 dock each piglet's curly tail, or the 
 other piglets would chew the brown,   
 hairy bit on it. From there the       
 piglets are put in stacked cages where
 they seem quite happy. Finally they go
 to fatness dens until they are 16     
 weeks, then they go to market.
