		<content>     A few weeks ago class 7 of        
 Hardwicke Parochial School went out to
 do a survey of the area. Before we    
 went out we made up a questionaire.   
 The questionaire consisted of         
 questions about farming, attitudes,   
 places of interest and historical     
 aspects. My friends and I are going   
 to write about peoples attitudes to   
 different questions.                  
     People  do like the area. They    
 like it for its walks, bike rides,    
 fresh air and the views. Everyone     
 said it was peaceful and quiet.       
 People prefer the country to the town 
 because in  the town  you can't get   
 fresh air, go for walks or bike rides.
       We asked the  farmers if they   
 liked working on the farm and if so   
 what was the worst job. None of the   
 farmers had worst jobs but the only   
 job they didn't like was mucking out. </content>
