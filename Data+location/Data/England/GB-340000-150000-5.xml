		<title>05Outside Ashton Windmill</title>
		<content>  Ashton Windmill is situated on the   
 highest part  of the Isle of          
 Wedmore.It is surrounded by flat moors
 so that there is nothing to stop the  
 wind blowing the sails around. In the 
 distance are the Quantock,Mendip and  
 Polden hills.The present windmill was 
 built between 1760 and 1774  but there
 has been a windmill there for at least
 600  years.It was used to grind the   
 corn and beans for the farmers who    
 lived nearby.The stone tower is 8     
 metres tall.The walls  are 60 cms     
 thick.It is round so that the wind    
 flows around it.The sails are 16      
 metres long.On the top is a cap shaped
  like a boat to 'sail'  through       
 the wind.The cap used to be thatched  
 .The weathercock on top told the      
 miller which way the wind was         
 blowing.Near the entrance is a stone  
 for the farmer to unload his corn.    </content>
