		<content> I am Louise and I like listening to   
 and making music. I read a lot and    
 enjoy writing. I love looking after my
 pets especially my cat Bag-puss. I    
 enjoy going to the theatre with mummy 
 I have collections of badges and      
 thimbles.                             
 My daddy does not have much leisure   
 time but he has many hobbies. He likes
 animals and birds and he has a large  
 model railway.                        
 My mummy likes sewing and knitting.   
 She makes corn dollies and she loves  
 music and her guitar.                 
 Laura, my sister, is three and she    
 likes playing with her dollies and she
 likes stories.
