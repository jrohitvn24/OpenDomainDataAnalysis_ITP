		<content>{ Bridge Farm}is {200 years old}being  
 originally a small cottage which has  
 been extended over the years. It      
 includes{18 acres}of land and is run  
 by the husband and wife owners and 1  
 full time employee.                   
  They own{100 chickens}that produce   
 about 90 eggs a day, which are sold in
 their small farm shop. They also keep 
 sheep, horses and pigs but do not     
 breed animals. Calves are purchased   
 and reared and then sold for meat to  
 dealers. This is very much a working  
 farm and disasters like{fowl pest},   
 which struck 15 years ago, are feared.
                                       
  These 3 farms are typical of the     
 farming that now takes place. Few     
 crops are grown, and even Hazelhurst  
 Dairy Farm has recently changed to    
 concentrating on beef cattle.
