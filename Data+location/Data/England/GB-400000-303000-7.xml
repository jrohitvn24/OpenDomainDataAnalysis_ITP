		<content> There are many different clubs        
 in Pelsall. Our investigations have   
 shown that one in every six people    
 attended at least one of Pelsall,s    
 clubs and societies.                  
   Considering the number of clubs in  
 Pelsall offering a wide choice of     
 interests we expected a larger        
 proportion of people to be involved in
 a club.                               
   To show this variety of interests   
 offered the following are just a few  
 of the clubs and societies which are  
 represented in Pelsall:Keep-Fit,      
 Pelsall Scouts, Youth Clubs,Lace      
 Making,Flower Arranging.
