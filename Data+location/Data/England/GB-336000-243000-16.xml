		<content> STAUNTON ON WYE CHURCH                
 The anglican church is away form the  
 main village up a steep path and can  
 be difficult for elderly people to    
 attend. There are 3 services a month, 
 average attendance 8-10 with more at  
 Festivals. The vicar, Mr Rees, lives  
 in Staunton. There is also a well -   
 attended Methodist Chapel and joint   
 prayer meetings are held fortnightly  
 at a home near the almshouses for the 
 old people there. There is a good peal
 of bells, often rung by local and     
 visiting teams of ringers. A special  
 churchyard fund was set up 6 years ago
 with donations collected for keeping  
 the grass mown and tidy. The church - 
 yard is a peaceful resting place with 
 its headstones, yew trees and wild    
 flowers in their season.
