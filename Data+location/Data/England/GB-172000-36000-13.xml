		<content> There is quiet at first while the     
 tents patiently wait for the first    
 entry. The first few people come to   
 get their flower arrangements ready   
 for the day ahead. Then come more and 
 more people. At eleven o'clock the    
 visitors cars start arriving and the  
 police are kept busy directing        
 traffic. The noise gets louder as all 
 the show sounds merge together. Soon  
 the playing field is full of people   
 avoiding the boys having water pistol 
 fights. The rest are looking at the   
 pets, farm animals, paintings and     
 flower arrangements. They also buy    
 things from stalls.Some people head   
 for the show jumping to watch the     
 power of the horses jumping in real   
 life.Then in the evening one by one   
 the people fade out leaving only the  
 litter behind.                        
                                       </content>
