 Mr. Baker of Ribble Bus Services      
 provided the following:-              
 10 bus routes regularly service the   
 Maghull area:        32l, 3ll,3l0,    
 302, 101, 340, 300,350,34l and 228.   
 Also 351 and 211.  All of the buses in
 the Aintree depot are red.  l40 men   
 are employed at the depot (it requires
 8 men to keep a bus operational, e.g. 
 drivers, mechanics, cleaners, etc)    
 Every year lOO new buses are order for
 Â£100,000 each.  They are made mainly  
 of fibreglass and aluminium and have  
 a working life of l5 years.  After    
 that time they are either scrapped or 
 sold to countries that cannot afford  
 new vehicles.  Petrol consumption is  
 approx. 9 miles per gallon.           
 Nobody has been killed by a Ribble bus
 since l957 and the most common        
 destination is Liverpool.             </content>
