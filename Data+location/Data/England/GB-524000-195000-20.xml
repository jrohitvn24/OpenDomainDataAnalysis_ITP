 BARNET HORSE FAIR IS HELD EVERY       
 SEPTEMBER.IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IT HAS
 BEEN HELD IN A FIELD NEAR TOTTERIDGE  
 BECAUSE THE COUNCIL BARRACADED THE    
 USUAL FIELD OFF BARNET LANE WITH      
 SKIPS. OPPOSITION TO THE HORSE FAIR IS
 NOT NEW.IN 1888 THE LORD OF THE MANOR 
 PETITIONED THE HOME SECRETARY TO      
 ABOLISH THE FAIR BUT THIS WAS OPPOSED 
 SUCCESSFULLY BY BARNET TOWNSMEN.THEY  
 ARGUED THAT THEY WOULD LOSE           
 FINANCIALLY BECAUSE AT THE TIME CATTLE
 WERE TRADED AS WELL;ABOUT 50,000 HEAD 
 OF CATTLE WOULD CHANGE HANDS AT THE   
 FAIR.THE SEPTEMBER FAIR WAS FOUNDED BY
 CHARTER IN HENRY THE SECOND'S TIME AND
 CONFIRMED BY A GRANT FROM QUEEN       
 ELIZABETH THE FIRST.TWO OTHER FAIRS   
 HELD IN APRIL AND NOVEMBER HAVE       
 DWINDLED AWAY.IN LATER YEARS BARNET   
 FAIR BECAME COCKNEY SLANG FOR 'HAIR'. </content>
