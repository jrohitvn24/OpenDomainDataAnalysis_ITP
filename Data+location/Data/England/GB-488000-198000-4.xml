		<content>   The school was designed by F.Pooley,
 who was the county architect  at that 
 time.It took about 18 months to build.
 It was opened by Sir David Eccles 29  
 years ago in January 1956 but there   
 have been many additions since then.  
 Amongst these are three laboratories, 
 an office and a staffroom.Some special
 rooms are a sports hall,design centre,
 music rooms and drama studios,computer
 room,photo studios and a business and 
 information area.                     
   The school has about 650 pupils aged
 12 to 16 and 100 in the Sixth Form.   
 There are about 45 teachers and about 
 the same number of other staff.       
   As well as learning the normal      
 acedemic subjects,maths,sciences,     
 languages etc.,the pupils can also    
 join in woodwork and metalwork and    
 learn other practical skills.
