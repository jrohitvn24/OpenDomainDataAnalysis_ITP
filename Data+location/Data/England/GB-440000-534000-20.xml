 more people. One person is "On" and he
 has to chase and catch another person 
 and then that person is "On". The     
 first person is free and runs away.The
 one that is "On" has to catch someone 
 else and the game continues.          
                                       
 DEAD LIONS is a game played by any    
 number of people who have to lie down 
 on their backs and pretend to be dead.
 Someone goes round making sure that   
 you do not move because if you do you 
 are out. The last person lying        
 perfectly still wins the game.        
                                       
 CHUCKY is a game in which you need    
 twelve people and a ball. Make two    
 teams with six on each side of the    
 school yard. You throw the ball and if
 you do not catch it,it is one point to
 the other team.                       </content>
