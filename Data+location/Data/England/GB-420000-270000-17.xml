		<content>{MRS.DAFFERN}has lived in the village  
 for many years.She feels that people  
 were happier half a century ago than  
 they are now. Because they had less   
 money,they never found it a problem,  
 and they did not feel they had to lock
 their house when they went out.       
{TRANSPORT}has changed immensely.      
 Bicycles used to be the main means of 
 transport because they were cheap.As  
 people grew wealthier,motor bikes     
 became popular,then vans and now cars.
{SHOPPING.}One small shop and Post     
 Office served each family adequately. 
 The older generation did not like     
 helping themselves in supermarkets;   
 they felt that they were taking things
 that were not rightly theirs. The     
 village shop used to be open from 8am 
 until 6pm with only one half-day.Now  
 the Post Office only opens Mon.Tues.&amp; 
 Thursdays from 9am-12noon.            </content>
