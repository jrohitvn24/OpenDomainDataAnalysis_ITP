		<title>10Whitminster Childrens Games.</title>
		<content> Like children all over the country the
 children of Whitminster play a wide   
 variety of games. Many of the games   
 they play have not changed for        
 generations and are well remembered by
 their parents as well. Here are a few 
 examples.                             
                                       
{The Clapping Game.}                   
                                       
 For the Clapping Game you start with  
 your hands in  special position. One  
 up in the air and one down below. You 
 need a partner to clap with.  First   
 you clap together twice and then on   
 your own. You clap to a song which    
 goes like this:                       
 "A sailor went to sea, sea, sea       
 To see what he could see, see, see    
 And all that he could see, see, see   
 Was the bottom of the deep blue sea,  
 sea, sea".    Continued on page 11.   </content>
