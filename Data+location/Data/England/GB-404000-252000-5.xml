 church hall in 1909 along with a      
 caretakers cottage and the Manse. Its 
 congregation comes from Harvington,   
 Broom, Inkberrow, Cock Bevington and  
 Atch Lench. About 30 people attend    
 Sunday evening services. There is also
 a Tuesday Bible Study Group. The      
 minister also conducts services at    
 churches in Alvechurch, Kempsey, Atch

 There are only 3 or 4 children in the

 been preaching for 50 years.
