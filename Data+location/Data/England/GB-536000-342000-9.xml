		<content>   We have a playing field in Fishtoft 
 which is used for football and        
 cricket. The tennis courts are now    
 overgrown. There is a small play area 
 for children with a few swings, a     
 slide, a roundabout and a climbing    
 frame.                                
   The large playing field at Freiston 
 was donated by several farmers after  
 the war as a memorial field. It is    
 used for cricket, tennis, football and
 bowls and in July they hold a village 
 fete called the Freiston Donkey Derby.
   Built recently on the field is the  
 Danny Flear Centre - he was a founder 
 member of the playing field committee.
 It is used for various activities     
 including badminton, ballroom dancing,
 whist, bingo and social functions.    
   Butterwick has a small field used by
 the football club and the school and  
 includes a childrens play area.       </content>
