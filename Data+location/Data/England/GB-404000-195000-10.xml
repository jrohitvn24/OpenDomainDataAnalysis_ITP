		<title>10SOUTH CERNEY CRICKET CLUB</title>
		<content>  The cricket pitch is in Upper Up. It 
 is of average size, but below average 
 standard. It's a dangerous pitch      
 because of all the bumps in it: the   
 ball can bounce up and hit you. It is 
 used once a week. Sometimes the net is
 used instead of the pitch but this is 
 not much good as it, too, has bumps!  
  Next to this is the toilet. It's a   
 shed with a rope and a bucket in it.  
  The pavilion, though old, is in      
 better condition than the pitch.      
 Surrounding the cricket pitch are     
 swings, slides and a football field.  
 The swings had very little graffiti,  
 suggesting that the council looks     
 after them.
