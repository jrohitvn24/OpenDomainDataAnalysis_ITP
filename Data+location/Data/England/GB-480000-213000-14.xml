		<title>14MARKET TRADE IN AYLESBURY</title>
		<content>  We asked stall owners on the market  
about {trade} in Aylesbury. The        
majority said that trade was not as    
good as it used to be. All of them     
said that they had stalls on other     
{markets} and that Aylesbury was the   
poorest. Some of the traders said that 
most of the new supermarkets were      
luring people away from the market     
area. Many said they had regular       
customers. One lady owned a bread      
store and she told us that a large     
{food} store supplied her rolls and    
doughnuts.                             
 We also visited the {cattle market}   
which has been open for about 40       
years. Most of the farmers were local  
or were within a 30 mile radius of     
Aylesbury. The farmers were bidding    
for cattle and sheep. The average      
weight of the cattle was 540 lbs.
