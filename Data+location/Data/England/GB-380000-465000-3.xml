		<content> Number 2, St John's Row is one of a   
 terrace of cottages which stand behind
 the Wesleyan chapel. They were built  
 over a hundred years ago for the      
 workers in the mill, which was then a 
 cotton mill but now makes paper. The  
 houses have two storeys and           
 dormer-windowed attics. The original  
 sash windows have been replaced with  
 aluminium framed double glazing which,
 strangely, does not look at all out of
 place. They also have slate roofs and 
 attractive stone fronts.              
                                       
                                       
 Houses here are much sought after by  
 retired couples and families wanting a
 second home. As a result, the prices  
 tend to be rather higher than in other
 parts of the Dales.
