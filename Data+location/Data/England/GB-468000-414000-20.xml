		<title>20A WALK ON THE MOORS</title>
		<content>    {THE SECOND WALK ON THE MOORS.}    
                                       
 We saw an old paraffin mil but it was 
 all in pieces, except for an old      
 fireplace which was still standing. We
 carried on until we got to the part of
 the moors where it was all peat. We   
 found dry peat and damp peat. The damp
 peat was stacked in two rows, and     
 every bit of peat was cut up into     
 sections. The dry peat that we found  
 was scattered around in different     
 places. We found an old tree trunk and
 Mr. Eversham said it was over 2,000yrs
 old and could be as much as 4,000yrs  
 old. We all stopped at a field of peat
 and watched a machine, it wasn't      
 working, but the man started it up    
 just for us. It was brill!
