		<title>08Wildlife around Ryhope</title>
		<content>{   Ryhope}is quite a good place for   
 looking at wildlife.{Wildlife}can be  
 found everywhere in Ryhope but we felt
 that there were three places where it 
 could be seen best. These were:-{the  
{seashore, Sunniside,}and{Cherry Knowle
{Dene.                                 
    The{cliffs}by the{seashore}are     
 being eroded quite quickly by the{sea}
 and the weather as they are made of   
 clay. There are a number of rockpools 
 which are exciting to explore.        
    In{Sunniside}there are lots of     
 bushes. There are signs that it is    
 inhabited by foxes, rabbits and       
 badgers.                              
{   Cherry Knowle Dene}seems to be the 
 best place to observe wildlife in     
 Ryhope. A stream runs through the{    
{dene,}either side of which there are  
 different types of trees. It is also a
 good place to study{wild flowers.     </content>
