		<content> On Monday 25th of November ILG went   
 to Portishead.We got there by bus,

 beach and walked up to the{lighthouse 
 and played on the rocks .We caught the
 bus back from the High Street at      
 quarter past two. On the way back alot
 of people sat at the back.It was a    
 good day out and the day did brighten 
 up.
