		<title>07  STREET GAMES - CALNE</title>
		<content> Something is always happening in our  
 street whether it is something big    
 like a fire or something small like a 
 cat stuck up a tree, which happens a  
 lot. We play a lot of different games 
 like Curby, Pom pom or off ground tag.
 Pom pom is a game like Hide and       
 seek only you have a post and while   
 the person who is "on" it is looking  
 for the other people one of them can  
 run to the post and say "Pom pom      
 1,2,3, and in" and that person is in. 
 If the person who is "on" it sees     
 someone they both run to the post and 
 if the catcher gets there first he    
 says "Pom pom 1,2,3 and out" and he or
 she is out.Curby is a game for two    
 teams of any number .One on each side 
 of the road stands on the curb with a 
 tennis ball. The first person throws  
 the ball at the opposite curb. If it  
 hits and rebounds it is a "Curby".    </content>
