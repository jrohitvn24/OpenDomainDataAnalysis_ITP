		<title>19Animal Sanctuary</title>
		<content> The Margaret Green Foundation Trust   
 has an animal sanctuary at Hyde, well 
 away from residential areas where the 
 noise of barking would constitute a   
 nuisance. Here dogs are cared for     
 until new homes can be found for them.
 No dog is destroyed unless it is past 
 veterinary help. Of the dogs taken    
 into the kennels some are simply      
 abandoned and straying, some are      
 unwanted by their owners who ask for  
 help, and some have to be rescued from
 cruel situations. Cruelty takes the   
 forms of neglect and physical damage, 
 sometimes due to ignorance, and the   
 kennels are unable to meet the demands
 for help with unwanted or difficult   
 pets. The Trust is dependent on       
 voluntary contributions. Under the    
 l9ll Protection of Animals Act, the   
 Trust may bring legal action "for     
 causing unnecessary suffering".       </content>
