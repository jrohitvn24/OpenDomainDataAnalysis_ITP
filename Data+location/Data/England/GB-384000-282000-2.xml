Earlier known as Kinfare, the village  
is recorded in the Domesday Book as    
Chenevare meaning Â£Great Ridge'. It    
belonged to the King as part of the    
Royal Forest. In the 12th century the  
king's tenant was Philip Holgate. In   
1257 Kinver was given a charter        
granting the privilege of holding a    
market or fayre. This charter was      
renewed by several monarchs, the last  
being Charles 1 in 1629. This charter  
may be seen in Kinver Parish Church. An
earlier charter is believed to exist   
dating from 736 and 964 A.D.. We are   
told that Ethelbald granted a piece of 
land to Earl Cynebert for the purpose  
of founding a Â£retreat'. Cynebert may  
have given the name Kynfer.
