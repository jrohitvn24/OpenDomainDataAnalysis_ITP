		<title>12Caring Services - Sth.Oakley</title>
		<content> Until the 1950's{East Oakley Village  
{Hall}was used as the local venue for  
 the{County Library.}The books were    
 stored in large boxes which were      
 exchanged every three months. This    
 service was run by village volunteers.
 Now there are two{library vans}serving
 the village. One stops for two hours  
 on alternate Tuesdays, outside the    
 village hall and is used mainly by old
 folk from Petersfield.                
                                       
 A{Community Care Group,}the brain     
 child of Revd.{John Litton,}Parish    
 Rector, has developed during the last 
 ten years. It is operated by          
 volunteers who provide services such  
 as: transport for the old or infirm,  
 visiting house bound people, looking  
 after children during a family crisis 
 or providing help within the community
 as the need arises.                   </content>
