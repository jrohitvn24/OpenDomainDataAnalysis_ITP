		<content>  Life here in 1985,is far more        
 comfortable for most people than at   
 any time in the past.Houses are in a  
 better condition,better heated and    
 drier.The coming of electricity and   
 piped water have completely changed   
 the lives of country people.Electric  
 lighting,television and radio,and     
 domestic appliances are commonplace.  
 Kitchens have steel sinks with hot and
 cold water.We have bathrooms and      
 inside toilets,but no mains sewerage  
 in the villages:each house has a      
 septic tank.This may be emptied by the
 Council on payment of Â£38.            
  There are no street lamps and the    
 houses are not numbered,but named.The 
 roads have no name plates,nor is there
 a village name sign,so many strangers 
 find it difficult to know where people
 live.All pay Water rates,and household
 refuse is collected once a week.      </content>
