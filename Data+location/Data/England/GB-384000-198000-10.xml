		<title>10RELIGION IN NAILSWORTH AREA</title>
		<content>{St.George's }church,Nailsworth, is    
 Church of England.It is rather plain  
 so an artist, Sir Oliver Heywood,is   
 painting a mural at the back of the   
 church.It shows the everyday life in  
 Nailsworth, with{Jesus}in the centre. 
 Above the altar there is a large      
 stained glass window.Before{          
{St.George's }was built here in {      
 Nailsworth,there was a church called  
{Pepperpot}because of its shape.       
  There is a non conformist church{    
 called{Christchurch.}It has chairs    
 instead of pews.The organ is upstairs 
 and is often hidden by a curtain.     
   There is a Baptist Chapel in        
 Minchinhampton and a Roman Catholic   
 church in{Box.}Opposite the primary   
 school there is an old chapel which is
 now used as a playschool/youthclub.   
 The{Society of Friends' (Quakers)}    
 meeting house is on Chestnut Hill.    </content>
