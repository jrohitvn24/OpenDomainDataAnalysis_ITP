		<title>15Blackfield Middle school</title>
		<content>      In September 1982 several primary
 schools in the Waterside area became  
 First and Middle schools. These took  
 children from 5_8 and 8_12 years.     
 Blackfield and Holbury were both      
 extended to make room for Middle      
 school provision.                     
    We visited Blackfield school to see
 if we could find any similarities and 
 differences.                          
    Blackfield school is older than    
 Holbury Middle.Blackfield school was  
 built in 1958 and our school was built
 in 1968. Our school is about the same 
 as their school. In our upper school  
 area we have got an open area. Our    
 open area is bigger than their's.Their
 classrooms are smaller and some are   
 bigger.In our school there are 15     
 classrooms whereas they have 14.      
    Blackfield have a swimming pool and
 a large running track.                </content>
