		<content> There are not only two well known     
 dialects of English, namely, the broad
 Herefordshire and Gloucestershire     
 which can be aligned to the Parishes  
 of The Lea,Weston-under-Penyard,Hope  
 Mansell and Aston Ingham in           
 Herefordshire and the Parish of       
 Longhope in Gloucestershire but there 
 remain the Parishes of Mitcheldean    
 and Drybrook in Glos. which have a    
 marked Forest of Dean dialect which is
 not understood by those in the        
 neighbouring parishes.The following   
 examples spelt phonically will clarify
    beum     thikum      yud   beast   
    are you  thick one   head  are you 
                                       
    dree week                          
    three week (ends).i.e. a fortnight.
 There is very little movement of the  
 lips indicating an origin associated  
 with suspicion of the foreigner inborn</content>
