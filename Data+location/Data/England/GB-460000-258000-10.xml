		<title>10 THE CORNER SHOP-WEEDON BEC</title>
		<content>  The children in our class use the    
corner shop most often.It sells        
sweets,groceries and vegetables.We call
the owner Dave.                        
  Dave sells about 1350 items a day and
serves over eighty children on a school
day.He opens his shop every day of the 
week and is usually open from 06.30    
until 18.00 hours.                     
  Dave told us that he buys his own    
groceries from his own shop.The only   
medicines he sells are headache        
tablets.                               
  He has been robbed twice,the robbers 
took wine,cigarettes and money.        
  Dave does not think that small shops 
like the corner shop will survive for  
very long.Many people use the big      
supermarkets in Northampton and        
Daventry.
