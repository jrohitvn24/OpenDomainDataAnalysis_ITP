    Most of the houses in our area are 
 either semi-detached or terraced      
 houses and have gardens both back and 
 front.Usually the corner houses are   
 the biggest and have the biggest      
 gardens.                              
                                       
   Many of the houses were built in    
 the 1930's as the {Underground Railway
 spread out from{Central London.       
{}                                     
   They are built of brick and have a  
 red tile roof and pebble-dashing      
 on the walls.Most of them have two    
 storeys.                              
                                       
   There are very few tall blocks of   
 flats in our area but several 3 or 4  
 storey blocks.
