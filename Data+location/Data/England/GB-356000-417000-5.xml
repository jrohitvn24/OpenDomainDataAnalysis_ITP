		<title>05Chorley. A General Review  1</title>
		<content>The houses are mainly terraced,many of 
Accrington brick.There is some         
semi-detached, council and privately   
owned housing.Along Eaves Lane,as well 
as different types of shops, there is  
an old 'Work House',which is about one 
hundred years old. To-day this is a    
hospital and is used mainly for        
mentally retarded and old people. A    
useful recent addition to the area is  
the Tatton Community Centre.           
At Hartwood roundabout,oon the North   
side of Chorley several roads meet: The
A674 goes to Blackburn. The M61 and A6 
lead Northwards to Preston. and        
Southwards to Manchester. The          
Blackpool/Manchester railway line      
passes here. Also at Hartwood there is 
a modern Hospital complex  and a Hotel.
