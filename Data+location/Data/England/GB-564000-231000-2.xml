		<title>02LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY</title>
		<content> This is a farming area. Mainly arable.
 The crops grown are wheat,barley,oats,
 pulses,sugar beet and oil seed rape.  
 Meadowland for hay. Pastures for      
 grazing. Very few animals.Beef cattle.
 Few milking cows. Shire mare with two 
 foals.Sheep.Horses for riding and     
 hunting.The area is more wooded than  
 in most parts of Essex.The soil is    
 mainly boulder clay with chalk        
 underlay and flints.Many small houses 
 and walls reflect the latter. Early   
 summer in May the rape bursts into    
 bloom and the fields are great swathes
 of bright yellow.After the harvest the
 stubble is burnt off or ploughed in,  
 leaving the fields a pattern of black 
 and brown.After a few weeks winter    
 wheat is planted and small green      
 shoots soon appear.Spring and the     
 fields are bright green.Summer; golden
 corn is ready for harvest again.      </content>
