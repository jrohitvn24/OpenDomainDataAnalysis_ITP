		<title>18HEALTHCARE:SCAMBLESBY AREA</title>
		<content>  This is a rural area,so there are no 
 big hospitals nearby,and people have  
 to travel long distances to visit     
 doctors &amp; dentists.There are two small
 hospitals in the area about 7 miles   
 away, catering mainly for the elderly 
 and people needing minor surgery.     
  If people need nursing but are not   
 ill enough for hospital treatment,they
 are visited in their homes by district
 nurses who look after the patient and 
 help the family.                      
  Usually{babies are born in hospital} 
 but are sometimes born at home.The    
 mothers are looked after by midwives: 
 specially-trained nurses who can      
 deliver babies.Children under 5yrs.are
 checked by health visitors who visit  
 their homes to see that the child is  
 developing properly.They also ensure  
 that the necessary injections are     
 given to protect them from disease.   </content>
