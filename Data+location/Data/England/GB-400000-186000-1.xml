		<content> Sparsely populated area with cross    
 section of social classes and         
 generations.                          
 Farms no longer employ labourers and  
 rely on family members to work land   
 and care for livestock.               
 Established residents appreciate the  
 community spirit but newcomers often  
 feel isolated from people as well as  
 amenities, of which there are         
 virtually none.                       
 Public transport hardly exists.       
 Private cars are relied on for getting
 to work, shopping and social outings. 
 A country area such as this provides  
 its own recreation such as fox hunting
 and shooting.                         
 Area comes within Braydon Forest and  
 is of high ecological value.          
 Main ground cover is intensively      
 managed grassland.                    
                                       </content>
