		<title>03Mining in Denaby and Cadeby</title>
		<content> For over a century{mining}has been the
 major, basic industry in the area,    
 with collieries in Denaby (1866) and  
 Cadeby (1894) providing jobs for many 
 men and school-leavers.               
      By 1935 5,000 men were employed  
 at the two pits, linking most families
 with the industry. In the last two    
 decades, however, the two mines have  
 had a{decreasing role}in the          
 community. Denaby lost its pit in     
 1969; Cadeby Colliery, now with a     
 workforce of less than 500, will be   
 added to the list of pit closures     
 within two years, resulting in more   
{redundancies}to add to the area's     
 already high rate of unemployment.    
 This is causing much antagonism,      
 coming immediately after the recent   
{industrial action}against pit closures
 in the country.
