		<content> We visited the Old Age Pensioner in   
 our teacher's car. He lived in a flat 
 up some stairs. When we got there he  
 had some visitors but they went and   
 left us alone. We asked him if he had 
 many visitors and he said someone is  
 nearly always calling but that some   
 O.A.P.'s are very lonely. He lives by 
 himself in the flat: his wife died    
 three years ago. He is disabled and   
 finds it hard to get about, but the   
 Council and neighbours help him in    
 many ways such as getting his shopping
 and the Meals on Wheels Service. Many 
 O.A.P's live in the area and he has   
 friends he goes to the Pub with for a 
 drink and a game of cards. He didn't  
 retire from his last job because he   
 was 65, but because he was made       
 reduntant and was too old to get      
 another job. His disablement was      
 caused by an accident in the pit.     </content>
