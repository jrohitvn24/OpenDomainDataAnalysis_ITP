		<content>  Peak Dale's Holy Trinity Church was  
 built in 1885.It was finished and     
 opened in 1886,and cost Â£1800 to      
 build.The first marriage was in 1909. 
  The church has got one warden, a     
 bell, a canteen, an altar, a reading  
 stand and some seats.It was intended  
 that the church would have an 85ft    
 tower to house a bell,but             
 unfortunately there wasn't enough     
 money.                                
  The seats were given to the church by
 a man called Chapman, and they are    
 made out of pine.                     
  In 1940 an organ was given to the    
 church.The man who played the organ   
 was buried in the church, he was a    
 school master and was aged 32.        
  The centenary celebrations start on  
 September 26th 1985, and carry on into
 the next year.During the celebrations 
 they plan to hold a special service,  </content>
