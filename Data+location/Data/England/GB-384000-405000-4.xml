		<title>04RECREATION IN MIDDLETON</title>
		<content>     Facilities in Middleton are fairly
 comprehensive in scope though the {   
{quantity}is inadequate considering the
 population of the area.               
     The town is well served with a    
 recently renovated public baths and a 
 new sports centre on the same site.   
 Within this complex, tennis, squash,  
 badminton, volleyball, snooker etc.   
 are all catered for. There are        
 facilities for outdoor football games 
 at the town hall grounds where tennis 
 is also played. Middleton has its own 
 cricket club at Towncroft and golf is 
 played at N.Manchester Golf Club. Golf
 can also be practised at the driving  
 range in Bowlee.                      
      Fishing is enjoyed at Rhodes with
 several lodges for club members and   
 the local canal also provides sport.  
 Woodland at Alkrington and Hopwood    
 can be enjoyed by all ages.           </content>
