		<content>   The Mosses area contains a great    
 deal of low-lying,marshy land.Over the
 years some of it has been drained by  
 digging a series of{drainage ditches  
 which empty out into the estuary.Some 
 of the drained land is now being used 
 as rough grazing pasture for sheep and
 cattle.                               
   Much of the area is still in the    
 process of being drained and is not   
 yet fit for agricultural use.One area 
 which is known as{Deanholme Moss}has  
 been dissected by ditches at 50 to    
 100m. intervals.These ditches are     
 about 1m. wide and 2m. deep.The land  
 between them is of a peaty nature.    
 Because the land is of such low       
 gradient the peat takes a long time to
 drain.                                
   The drained areas which are not yet 
 farmed are mostly covered by heath or 
 conifers.                             </content>
