		<content>{Unemployment}in Bexhill is quite high.
 The jobless total for East Sussex in  
 June 1985 was 27384 out of a total of 
 756153 for the whole of the south east
 region.                               
 The{police}in Bexhill are thoroughly  
 understaffed and overstretched. The   
 public's attitude towards the police  
 is normal, though relations are       
 getting strained. Too much emphasis is
 placed on teenage and traffic problems
 by the police, but now, like other    
 towns, Bexhill is switching to        
 community policing.{Crime}is at a     
 fairly regular level, apart from the  
 horror caused by "Dr. Death" over the 
 past few months in early 1985 after   
 his break-out from Northeye prison.   
 There are very few{muggings}in        
 Bexhill.
