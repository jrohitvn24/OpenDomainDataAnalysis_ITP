 under gone a dramatic change since the
 population of the village has nearly  
 doubled as two new housing estates    
 have been built recently.             
  The first most significant change was
 when the local grocery shop was closed
 to be replaced by a self-service      
 supermarket.Newcomers to the village  
 are pleased with the variety of       
 shopping facilities.There are two     
 butchers, a hair dressers, a bank, a  
 clothing shop and a very popular fish 
 and chip shop. For car repairs and    
 petrol sales there is a newly         
 renovated garage. There are also three
 public houses.                        
  In addition to the permanent trading 
 shops, there are various tradesmen who
 bring shops on  wheels, such as the   
 fish trader and a mobile vegetable    
 trader.                               </content>
