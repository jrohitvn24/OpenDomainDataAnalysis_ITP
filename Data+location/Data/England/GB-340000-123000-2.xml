		<content> Beatrice,born 5th of April, 1916. I   
 was born at East                      
 Street,Drayton and attended Drayton   
 School from 3 to 11 years of age.  I  
 then  went to Curry Rivel School      
 until I was l4.  My first job was as  
 kitchen maid at Burton Pynsent.  I    
 lived in and wages were five shillings
 a week .                              
  I had one half day off on Wednesdays 
 and every other Sunday.  I had to be  
 back indoors by nine o'clock.  I      
 worked there for three years, then had
 two other  'in service ' jobs before  
 marrying.  I did morning cleaning jobs
 until the children came.              
  I married Reg. on the 4th of         
 February,1939.  We lived, at first,   
 with my husband's people, then we     
 rented our present home in January,   
 l940. for a rent of five shillings a  
 week.                                 </content>
