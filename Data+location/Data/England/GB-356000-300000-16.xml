		<content>   During our survey of the area, we   
 found that 90% of the women were      
 housewives and that any part-time     
 employment involved farming           
 activities.                           
   Hobbies included knitting,sewing,   
 gardening,cooking,sport,dried flowers,
 walking,refurbishing machinery and    
 antiques.  These hobbies reflected    
 an interest in the home and in the    
 countryside, which would appear to be 
 very common in this area.  However,   
 most of our interviewing was          
 accomplished during the day when,     
 generally, only housewives were at    
 home.                                 
   Within this area, it appears that   
 hobbies are more important as a spare 
 time activity than is television.  We 
 discovered that sport and news are    
 watched during the evening with an    
 occassional interest in soap operas.  </content>
