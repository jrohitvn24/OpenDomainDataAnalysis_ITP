		<title>03FEATURES: BROWNHILLS AREA.</title>
		<content>   An urban and industrial landscape is
 found in the Brownhills/Walsall Wood  
 area. High-rise blocks of flats, large
 housing estates, the Maybrook         
 Industrial Estate, the Wyrley and     
 Essington Canal and Brownhills        
 Shopping Centre are features of note. 
 Some of the land eg. near Clayhanger, 
 has suffered from subsidence due to   
 earlier coalmining but infilling and  
 reclamation has partly remedied this  
 problem.                              
   The eastern area consists mainly of 
 a rural landscape but the village of  
 Stonnall provides some interesting    
 historical buildings eg. St Peter's   
 Church, the Manor House, Fighting     
 Cocks Farm and Barn, the old Vicarage,
 Worsley House, Lynn Hall, the Old     
 School House. The Iron Age hill fort  
 known as Castle Fort is situated on   
 the ridge overlooking Stonnall.       </content>
