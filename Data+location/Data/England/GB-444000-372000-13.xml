		<content>   Although there are not so many      
 sightings today we believe{ghosts}are 
 just as abundant now as in the past.  
 In our area probably the most famous  
 haunting is that of{the 400 year old  
{school house at Netherthorpe.} The    
 ghost is supposedly of{an old master  
 who hung himself in a bedroom in the  
 house.  The old master's ghost is     
 supposed to make wailing noises and   
 pace up and down with a rope round his
 neck.  Our information shows that the 
 ghost appears around 5.00.-7.00pm but 
 there is no regularity of appearances.
   Another ghost in this area is the   
 one that haunts the{White House}near  
 Woodthorpe school.  The ghost belongs 
 to{an old lady}who spent the last     
 years of her life in the house.
