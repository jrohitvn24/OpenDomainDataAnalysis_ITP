		<title>06The Village School</title>
		<content> The present village school was built  
 in 1894. The children attending the   
 Primary school today come mainly from 
 the Norbury /Roston area, however the 
 school also serves the nearby village 
 of Snelston. Other pupils come from   
 Ashbourne, Ellastone , Clifton and    
 Stanton. The school is quite small,   
 numbering some 50 children, so in     
 order to encourage and provide a wider
 range of activities a mini bus has    
 been purchased. This allows groups to 
 be taken to other local schools for   
 sporting events etc. The mini bus is  
 used regularly for educational visits.
 The bus is shared by 4 schools.       
 Visitors are always welcome to this   
 very friendly and happy school.Many of
 the present day pupils parents came to
 this shool, one big happy family.
