		<title>17SCHOOL CENTENARY</title>
		<content> During the year from January to       
 December 1985 the Leigh Sinton Church 
 of England Primary school celebrated  
 its Centenary.The first school log    
 book was opened on the 1st January    
 1885.The year was marked by many      
 events including a Victorian Summer   
 Fair,a traditional walk across the    
 footpaths to church for the Ascension 
 Day service and a service of          
 Thanksgiving for the work of the      
 school during the last 100 years.This 
 service enabled the parents to see the
 entertainment presented by the        
 children to old scholars,Governors and
 the Bishop of Worcester on Centenary  
 Day.The Bishop unveiled a plaque and  
 later in the year distributed medals  
 to the children to commemorate the    
 Centenary.One of the more pleasing    
 facets of the Year was the renewed    
 contact with ex-scholars.             </content>
