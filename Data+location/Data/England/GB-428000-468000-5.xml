		<title>05Restoring the Water Gardens</title>
		<content>{  The National Trust}is hoping to     
 return the water garden at{Fountains  
{Abbey}to its  original state.The work 
 will take many years to complete and  
 the Trust will make efforts to keep it
 as it should be.They have made a start
 on the area near to the Mirror Pond.  
 The Mirror Pond reflects its          
 surroundings and gives the idea that  
 you can see more than there actually  
 is.                                   
  Neptune is a lead statue in the      
 middle of this pond.He has been taken 
 away to be restored.He was cut into   
 smaller pieces because it was too big 
 to be carried on a boat across the    
 pond.                                 
{ The River Skell}has been             
 straightened throughout the park. This
 canal is in need of some work. The    
 banks are collapsing and are wearing  
 away.                                 </content>
