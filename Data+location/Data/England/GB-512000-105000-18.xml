		<title>18A DURRINGTON SHOP</title>
		<content>  Overington's was establishd in 1793, 
 and has been in the family ever since.
 It started as a smithy,but now sells  
 and repairs lawnmowers and gardenware.
 At the back of the shop is a yard     
 selling wood and garden sheds.The shop
 is made out of stone with a thatched  
 roof.A small hut has been built in    
 which the lawnmowers are repaired.    
 Overington's have much competition    
 from the newly-opened Tesco's store in
 the area,for the Tesco lawnmower      
 prices are cheaper.Tesco's also have a
 main shopping centre where people are 
 liable to look for the garden         
 equipment and lawnmowers.Overington's 
 are not near any main shopping centre 
 (like Tesco's) but they still have an 
 advantage for they repair lawnmowers  
 as well as selling them.
