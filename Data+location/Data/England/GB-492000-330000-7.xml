		<content>  On June 5th.we did traffic counts    
 comparing the A1 with the B6403       
 (Ermine Street).The survey was done   
 from 2.30pm. to 3.00pm.at both places.
 RESULTS                               
    {Cars   Lorries  Vans  Others Total
{A1}   226      260    50      5    541
{B6403 }64       14    14      0     92
                                       
   This shows that the A1 is a         
 extremely busy road.The time of the   
 survey was not the peak time.The count
 would have been much higher had the   
 survey taken place at 8.30am.or at    
 5.00pm.                               
   Perhaps the volume of traffic       
 warrants expansion or even some form  
 of relief road.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
