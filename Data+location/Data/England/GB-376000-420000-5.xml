		<title>05CHURCHES IN HELMSHORE.</title>
		<content> Around Helmshore there are six        
 churches. In Irwell Vale there is an  
 old chapel which used to be the church
 but is now a row of three cottages. It
 was a church until about a hundred    
 years ago. When the people of the     
 village grew rich they decided to     
 build a new church; they did, and it  
 is still used today.                  
                                       
{St. Thomas'}church is bigger than     
 Irwell Vale church and is probably    
 older.{St. Veronica's}is a Catholic   
 church and looks more like a big house
 with a big garden.                    
                                       
 In St. Thomas' churchyard there is a  
 monument dedicated to William Turner, 
 a local mill owner.
