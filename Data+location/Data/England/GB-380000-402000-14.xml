		<title>14ST MARY'S CHURCH PRESTWICH</title>
		<content> It is almost certain that a place of  
 worship has stood where the Parish    
 Church now stands for over 800        
 years.There are many unusual features 
 in this{15th. century Church.         
                                       
 In the Hilton Chapel there is a       
 stained glass window which shows the  
 Wedding Feast at Cana, but the strange
 thing about it is that the table is   
 set as it would be in 1985 with knives
 and forks.                            
                                       
 During the{Civil War,}Cromwell's men  
 stormed the Church to prevent services
 being held there, and the lead shot   
 they fired at the old wooden door can 
 still be seen embedded there.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
