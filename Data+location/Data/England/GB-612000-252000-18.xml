		<title>18Hemingstone/Coddenham Estate</title>
		<content> Shrubland Park Estate is the home of  
 the de Saumarez family, the present   
 Lord de Saumarez being the 6th Baron. 
 In 1966 the Mansion was converted into
 a Health Clinic and the family moved  
 into The Vista, a new house built for 
 them on the Estate. Most of the Park  
 is arable land and there is a         
 commercially operated sawmill which   
 processes timber grown on the Estate. 
 The gardens are opened to the public  
 each year in support of charities.    
 Coddenham House, a classic Georgian   
 building was originally the Rectory.  
 It became too large for the incumbents
 to manage and in 1965 it was sold and 
 is now a private residence. A new     
 Rectory was built in 1974 in the      
 village. Hemingstone Hall, an         
 Elizabethan style mansion, has been   
 extensively landscaped and presents an
 attractive view from Rectory Road.    </content>
