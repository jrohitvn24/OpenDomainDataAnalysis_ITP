		<content> An M.O.D. sponsored, but largely      
 civilian, conservation group records  
 all aspects of natural history in the 
 Military Training area which, being   
 free of agricultural chemicals, is    
 rich ecologically. It is active in the
 management of larger animals. Resident
 mamals include roe deer, foxes,       
 badgers, hares, rabbits and small     
 rodents. Sparrowhawk, buzzard, hobby, 
 harrier, quail, partridge, pheasant   
 and several types of owl breed in the 
 area.A small group of garganey nest in
 the Beryl Valley and lapwing, golden  
 plover and redshank contribute to a   
 total of 87 species recorded. It is a 
 fruitful area for butterflies and     
 moths. In the botanical field 324     
 different flowering plants (including 
 7 types of orchid) and 3 varieties of 
 moss have been listed.
