		<title>01LANDSCAPE REVIEW LUTON WEST</title>
		<content>In large part this is the plateau of   
the Chilterns, a high but              
relatively flat area, a part  of the   
scarp is also included. The Roman      
Watling St A5 and the M1 use dry       
valleys to pass through the area.  The 
steep scarp is little used, being an   
open space near the towns. The plateau 
is mainly farmland, wheat, barley,rape 
and grass; there are no large numbers  
of sheep or cattle, the numbers of     
horses are noticeable. The NE fringe   
is part of Luton, on the plateau is    
the 1950's council estate of Farley    
Hill, below the scarp houses of early  
1900's, 1930's and 1970's., together   
with a continuous industrial zone.     
Other settlements include the village  
of Caddington, hamlet of Chaul End and 
several isolated farms.                
Transport and services relate to Luton 
and Dunstable.                         </content>
