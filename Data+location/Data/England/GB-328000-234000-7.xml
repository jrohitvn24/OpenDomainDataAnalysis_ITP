		<content>   During the{Second World War}the     
{Canadian Air Force}used Michaelchurch 
 Court as a{secret H.Q.}It's code name 
 was{"QZ".}It was used for storing     
 duplicate documents in case their     
 London H.Q. was destroyed by enemy    
 bombing.They also kept there for a    
 short time a secret bomb,which was    
 later used in the war.                
    Only 4 men staffed it at first but 
 eventually about a dozen people worked
 there.They were not particularly well 
 armed having only{12 rifles and 5}    
{pistols.}For transport they only had  
 1 staff car.They were not allowed to  
 send letters or make any telephone    
 calls.                                
   Although they mixed well with the   
 local people and made many lifelong   
 friends the secret has been kept until
 this year,{1985,}when one of the men  
 came back to visit.                   </content>
