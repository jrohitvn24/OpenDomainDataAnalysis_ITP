 This is the oldest Christian site in  
 our study block.Its name comes from   
 Cornish and may  mean "Brow church",  
 "Tal" means brow and "Lan" is a holy  
 place where Celtic monks preached.The 
 church is built on the side of a      
 hill.There are three Early English    
 windows from the 13th century,most of 
 the church is 15th century.There is a 
 carved slate coffin of a family called
 Bevill.The tower is separate from the 
 church.It has six bells.In the church 
 there is an inscription in the Cornish
 language.It says:"Benygys yu a-gar Dew
 dres pup tra us y'n bys".This means   
 "Blessed is he who loves God beyond   
 anything  there is in the world".     
 In the graveyard,there is a headstone 
 of a smuggler called Robert Mark who  
 was shot by Revenue men in 1802.
