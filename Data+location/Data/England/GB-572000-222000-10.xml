		<title>10The Town Hall, Braintree</title>
		<content>    The Town Hall stands on the corner 
 of Fairfield Road and Market Square.  
 For many years this splendid building 
 housed the main offices for Braintree 
 and Distict Town Council, however when
 Causeway House was built this fine    
 establishment was turned into a Centre
 for the Arts.                         
    The one time council offices now   
 are the home of many exhibitions on a 
 wide varietty of topics. The Braintree
 and Bocking Herritage Trust stage many
 of their presentations in these halls,
 giving an insight into the history of 
 our beautiful town, for the local     
 population.                           
    During the year some fine paintings
 are put on display in this gallery.   
 Courses on Art and Craft are also held
 within these walls. Much work is done 
 by the Braintree Arts Council and     
 their president Mr.I. Williams.       </content>
