{MOTHER'S DAY 1985. }     Mum loads the
 automatic  washer  with dirty clothes.
 They are soon clean and transferred to
 the rumbling, vibrating  tumble drier.
 Meanwhile,Mum pre-records a TV film on
 video.Fridge ingredients  are fed into
 the cake-mixer. Whirring,bubbling,they
 blend together. She  pops a snack into
 the  toaster  and  the  cake  into the
 microwave oven.A bell rings signifying
 the  cake  is  done.  "How's  your day
 been?" I ask.  "Oh, a woman's  work is
 never done!" Mum replies.    {S.Nield.</content>
