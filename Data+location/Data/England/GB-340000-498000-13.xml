		<content> Fortunately, the rate of unemployment 
 in the area is well below the national
 average. The demand for labour reaches
 its peak during the summer tourist    
 season, mainly from the hotel and     
 restaurant trades, when a large number
 of casual workers are taken on. Some  
 of these are school children.         
 The opening of a new supermarket by   
 the Preston firm of Booth's in April  
 1985 provided over 70 new jobs. It was
 built on the site of the railway      
 station, which moved 200m. down the   
 line, and used several of its         
 buildings. The effect on the smaller  
 food shops in the village has been    
 very marked, although cushioned to    
 some extent by the influx of summer   
 visitors. Winter will be the telling  
 time - perhaps one or even two of them
 would not be able to carry on.
