		<title>13St.James's Church 1</title>
		<content> St.James's is a very old church, the  
 oldest parts dating back to about     
 1006.  The belfrey is approximately   
 fifty metres tall and the steps are   
 narrow and spiral.  The organ is about
 one hundred years old (quite modern). 
 There is a memorial for Lucy Kemp     
 Welsh as well which was made by Mr.   
 Charles Browne.  It is made of stone  
 and is a horse.  There is a pulpit    
 made of oak which has designs dating  
 back to about 1600.  The lectern is a 
 brass eagle with a stand at the back  
 where you put the book.  The graves   
 outside are quite old but the oldest  
 of all is inside and belongs to Silus 
 Titus Armg.  The graveyard is very    
 big, about 800 feet long.  The royal  
 family would come to the church and   
 nominate the vicar.
