		<content>  In class maths this week we have been
 looking at different types of graphs; 
 drawing some and making up questions  
 we could ask the rest of the class.   
 This usually lasts for 20 minutes and 
 then we do our individual card maths. 
  Each person works at their own speed 
 through eight sets of cards. When they
 have finished a set they have to do a 
 test before they can carry on to the  
 next set. Mr. Swift marks the test    
 with us at dinner time and we tell the
 rest of the class how many marks we   
 have got. If we don't do very well we 
 have to do extra work before moving on
 to the next set. We have playtime     
 about 10.35, but just before play we  
 often say our multiplication tables.  
  Playtime is noisy. Some people stand 
 talking,eating their crisps,apples or 
 carrots,whilst others are busy playing
 with ropes,toys or at hide and seek.  </content>
