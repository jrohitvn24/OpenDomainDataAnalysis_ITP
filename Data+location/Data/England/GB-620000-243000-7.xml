		<content>   In  our  area  there are a number of
sports  grounds  owned by Ipswich firms
and   provided   by   them   as  sports
facilities for their employees.        
    Fisons, a chemicals and  fertilizer
company, own one of the sports grounds.
They purchased the  land  which  covers
more than 11 acres in 1951.  Previously
it was just barren land.               
   Fisons, part  of  a  large Norwegian
company,  employ  about  900  people in
Ipswich and about  350  people  come to
the sports complex each week.          
Employees  of  the  firm are allowed to
bring their friends  and  relatives  as
well. The facilities available  include
bowls, football pitches,  tennis courts
hockey pitch, pool, snooker  and  table
tennis.  The firm  would also  like  to
build a swimming pool and squash court.
   Fisons have four football teams  and
four bowls teams in local competitions.</content>
