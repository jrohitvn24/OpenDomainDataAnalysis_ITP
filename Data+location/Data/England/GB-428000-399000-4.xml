		<title>04Green Moor village</title>
		<content> Green Moor is quite a small village.It
 hasn't got any shops and we think it  
 should have at least 3 shops.1 co-op, 
 1 cafe, 1 butchers shop and we think  
 it should have a fish and chip shop.  
 There is one pub called The Rock Inn. 
 You can get meals from there and      
 chocolate and crisps. Outside, there  
 are tables and chairs you can sit at, 
 and outside the pub there is a pump   
 house and some old stocks. There are  
 no churches only one chapel. There is 
 a Sunday school which a lot of people 
 go to.There are concerts every year   
 which the  Sunday school are in .     
 There is only a van comes round and   
 you can get food from it . There is a 
 small museum containing old objects   
 such as mangles,gas masks and old     
 coins.
