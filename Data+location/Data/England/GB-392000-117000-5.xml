		<content>{  Mrs Witt}runs the{local post office 
 and shop.The room is quite small but  
 is used to its capacity with shelves  
 up to the roof and items are placed   
 one on top of each other.There is a   
 small booth in the corner of the room 
 with scales and a number of parcels.  
 On the wall nearest the door there is 
 a large pin board with pamphlets and  
 messages on and{this acts as the vill-
{age notice board.                     
  The every day needs like bacon,cheese
 and butter are sold the most.{Thursday
{and Friday}are really the busiest days
 because{Thursday is pension day and   
{Friday is the day before the week-end.
 A postman collects the parcels at{11  
{a.m. and 4.30 p.m.                    
  Mrs Witt can't really compete with   
 the big supermarkets. She does{not    
 sell dog and car licences.
