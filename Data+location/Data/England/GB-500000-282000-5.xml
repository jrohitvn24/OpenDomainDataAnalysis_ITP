		<title>05BIRD AVIARIES/LILFORD PARK 2</title>
		<content> It holds native and exotic birds.The  
 flamingo pen covers ten acres with a  
 collection of waterfowl, storks and   
 cormorants.By the hundreds of aviaries
 are recent huts where eggs of the     
 birds are reared in incubators until  
 they are hatched.They are then fed for
 up to three months and then finally   
 put out into the aviaries. There is   
 also a rat store where the rats are   
 kept ready to feed to vultures and    
 owls. On 4th year work experience     
 some P.W.S. students had to chop      
 up rats for the vultures! The visitors
 roaming around Lilford Park will more 
 than likely come across either some   
 wild hungry ducks or some very noisy  
 male and female peacocks. There is one
 rule that every visitor must comply   
 with and that is.....                 
{        DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS       
{           THEY MAY BITE YOU!         </content>
