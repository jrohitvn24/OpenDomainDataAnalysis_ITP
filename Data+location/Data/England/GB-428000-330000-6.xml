		<title>06School Diamond Jubilee</title>
		<content>{Sixty years}ago{Findern School}first  
 opened and to celebrate our{Diamond   
{Jubilee}every class has worked upon a 
 period going up in decades. My class  
 did the 1920's. There were different  
 groups in the class, four people to   
 each group. My group did work about   
 schools. In the end after all our     
 hard work we had a very good display. 
 Our parents came to look around each  
 class and they said it was very nice. 
                                       
 The choir and recorders gave two      
{concerts}one for the previous pupils  
 and one for the parents. Now I feel   
 sad its all over. I enjoyed the{party 
 a lot and we had games and a magician.
 A magician is a man who does lots of  
 tricks. The food was delicious and the
{disco}was very noisy  but excellent.
