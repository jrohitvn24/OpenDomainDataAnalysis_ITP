 where they{distil}essential oils and

 never seen a piglet!{Stafford Allen,  
 a relative of Allen and Hanbury, set  
 out to improve the quality of 'simple'
 medicines used by the very poor, 160

 looked after their workers far better 
 than other employers in those days,   
 but you did what "Sir" said! We all   
 had to wear white caps for going round
 the works, and we were given lots of  
 specimens - the{spices}seem to come   
 mostly from tropical countries, but   
 some 'escapes' grow by the roadside!  </content>
