		<title>19SLEAFORD REMEMBERED</title>
		<content>  THIS WAS WRITTEN AFTER TALKING TO AN 
 ELDERLY LADY FROM SLEAFORD.SHE        
 REMEMBERED THAT SLEAFORD USED TO BE A 
 VERY BUSY MARKET TOWN.THE WHOLE OF THE
 TOWNS PEOPLE WOULD MEET FOR THE MARKET
 ON A MONDAY.NEAR THE MARKET WAS A CORN
 EXCHANGE WHERE THE TOWNS FARMERS WOULD
 MEET AND EXCHANGE CORN.IT WAS ALSO    
 USED AS A TOWN HALL AND LOCAL MEETINGS
 AND DANCES WERE HELD THERE.THE CORN   
 EXCHANGE STILL STANDS TODAY ALTHOUGH  
 IT HAS CHANGED A BIT INSIDE AND OUT.  
  IF THERE WAS A SPELL OF HOT WEATHER A
 CART WOULD COME ROUND AND SPRINKLE,THE
 ROADS WITH WATER TO STOP THEM BECOMNG 
 DUSTY AND CRACKED.                    
  SLEAFORD AS WITH MOST MARKET TOWNS   
 HAD A TOWN CRIER HE USED TO STAND IN  
 THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND SHOUT OUT
 THE TOWNS NEWS.
