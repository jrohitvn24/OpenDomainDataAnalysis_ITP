		<title>18GOLDINGTON GREEN</title>
		<content> Goldington was once a village and now 
 forms part of the town of Bedford.    
   Goldington has a large open space   
 which is called the "The Green".This  
 area of common land has the main A428 
 east west trunk road crossing its     
 southern boundary.                    
   Our school lies to the south of this
 road and it is called Goldington Green
 Lower School, it was first built in   
 1865.                                 
   The road that follows the western   
 and northern edge of the Green is     
 called Church Lane. To the north can  
 be found the public house called      
 Goldington Hall parts of which date   
 from the seventeenth century.         
   Today the Green is used for many    
 recreational activities by the local  
 people.
