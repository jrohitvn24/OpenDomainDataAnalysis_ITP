		<content>The village newsletter,known as "The   
Link" began in January 1968.It is      
distributed free to 1200 homes in the  
Parish by 40 volunteers,each month     
except August.The cost is met mainly   
by the advertisers,the Parish council  
and donations from individuals."The    
Link" serves to inform the village of  
all its many activities and to be      
informative on various subjects such as
wildlife,garden care and local history.
There is also the occasional reader's  
letter,poem and devotional article as  
well as the regular news from St.Paul's
Church.The editor is a local Primary   
teacher.                               
The main local issues have been worries
like the state of roads and chlorine in
the water.There has been a successful  
campaign to bring Gas to this village  
and there is currently a campaign for  
the construction of a BMX track.       </content>
