		<content> The Lyneal_cum_Colemere W.I. has 25   
 members and was formed in 1933.       
 President _ Mrs. Jean Davies          
 Treasurer _ Mrs. Eileen Sumner        
 Secretary _ Mrs. Ann Williams         
 The meetings are held in Lyneal School
 on the first Thursday in each month,  
 starting at 7.15 and ending at 10pm.  
 Every month, 2 ladies make            
 refreshments for the meeting. It is   
 worked on a rota basis.               
 Every meeting, they have a speaker.   
 Some of the talks have been about     
 irons, tips on dressmaking, music and 
 cartoons and the care of feet.        
 Annually, they have a mystery trip.   
 Last time,they ended up at a village  
 inn and had a basket meal. The W.I.   
 raises money and some of it is sent to
 charities.
