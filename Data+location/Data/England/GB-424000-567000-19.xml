		<title>19JOBS IN LONGBENTON (2)</title>
		<content> Unemployment is a striking factor of  
 life in 1985 and this is reflected in 
 particular in Longbenton.             
 These are the views of some of the    
 children from St. Stephen's RC Primary
 School on their hopes for employment. 
 Daniel (aged 9): "Working in          
 Longbenton wouldn't interest me. I    
 would like to be a designer, producing
 new engines. I would like to work in  
 America."                             
 Joanne (aged 9): "I would not like to 
 work in Longbenton because there      
 aren't a lot of jobs in this area...I 
 would like to join the army because   
 you might get a chance to travel      
 abroad. The prospects would be        
 better."                              
 Kelly (aged 9): "I would love to work 
 in Newcastle in a fashion shop like   
 Top Shop. I think it would be         
 interesting serving all the customers.</content>
