		<title>13SATURDAY MARKET IN HERNE BAY</title>
		<content> One branch of the Herne Bay retail    
 trade which does flourish is the      
 Saturday morning market. Traders come 
 from all round the area and from as   
 far as London and they pay a fee to   
 have a market stall. The same traders 
 can usually be found in the same place
 every week and a wide range of        
 products, from cakes to keys, is sold.
 The market has its own atmosphere,    
 crowded with people so it is often    
 difficult to move about, while many of
 the traders call out to draw attention
 to their bargains. At the market      
 entrances people collect money for    
 good causes and some unofficial       
 traders try to sell from suitcases.   
 Certainly products can be bought      
 cheaply in the market, but sometimes  
 we wonder where the goods have come   
 from.                                 
                                       </content>
