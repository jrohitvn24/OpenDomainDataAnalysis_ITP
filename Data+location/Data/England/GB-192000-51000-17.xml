		<content> The Ecology group spent the whole     
 morning walking along the single track
 roads with occasional passing places. 
 Some of the roads were being          
 resurfaced that day,and this meant    
 closing them for a short time,to all  
 traffic,including pedestrians.During  
 the morning,all traffic was of light  
 Industrial/Agricultural type,except   
 for a few private cars.However while  
 walking the A3058,the traffic was so  
 heavy as to be impossible to count,   
 and nearly all were private cars.Other
 transport features included the       
 railway with two very impressive      
 viaducts,up to 8 arches and 100 feet  
 high.We noted only two isolated       
 postboxes.The group noted 5 trains,   
 4 of which were from the clay         
 industry.
