		<title>01ASTON SOMERVILLE AND AREA</title>
		<content> This is a very rural area which       
 consists mainly of open fields, small 
 woods and fruit orchards.  It is      
 fairly low lying with an average of   
 only 50 metres above sea level.  There
 are small country lanes which wind    
 through the fields and link with the  
 main roads outside the block.  Two    
 villages are within this area, Aston  
 Somerville is on the Western side and 
 Childswickham lies to the East. There 
 is also the small hamlet of Mount     
 Pleasant.  Aston Somerville is the    
 smaller of the two villages having a  
 population of about 200 residing in   
 around seventy houses.  There are     
 eleven farms in this block.  The      
 fields are used mainly for cereal crop
 growing and for grazing sheep and     
 cattle.  The whole area shows the     
 traveller a very restful, pastoral    
 scene.                                </content>
