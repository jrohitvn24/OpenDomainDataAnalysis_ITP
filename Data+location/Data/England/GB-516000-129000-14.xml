		<content> Mr. Cramp has run a family jewellery  
 business in West street for many      
 years. He was born in Horsham in 1914 
 and says he was a war baby! He        
 remembers his childhood in the the    
 flats above the shop when he went up  
 to bed with a candle for light.       
 Electricity was connected into his    
 house in 1928. Entertainment has      
 changed very much in his lifetime. He 
 recalls radio sets coming in about    
 1920 and the gramaphone a few years   
 later. Shopping is another area that  
 Mr. Cramp has seen seen change over   
 the years. He remembers the arrival of
 Woolworths in Horsham which closed in 
 1984 and how the arrival of           
 supermarkets has changed people's     
 shopping habits in Horsham.
