		<title>08Interview of a Fruit Farmer.</title>
		<content> Mr Arthur Usher turned his farm over  
 to fruit farming in 1963 and after    
 growing a variety of fruits now grows 
 apples only.                          
  {Why the change to fruit farming?}It 
 is much less demanding on my time     
 which gives me the opportunity to     
 develop other interests such as being 
 a county councillor.I am very busy at 
 picking time and the English climate  
 is always against you.                
  {How mechanised is your farm?}It is  
 mechanised as far as possible         
 _spraying, box handling etc.          
  {Do you employ casual labour for     
{picking?}Picking requires casual      
 labour.The problem is that the women  
 who do it with enthusiasm are getting 
 older and their daughters are not     
 interested in picking.I and my family 
 work at picking.
