		<title>20SARAH'S DAY IN AMPNEY</title>
		<content>   My name is Sarah and I am 10 years  
 old. My alarm clock wakes me and I sit
 up in bed. I get up and get dressed. I
 get the paper from the barn. I take   
 my dog Snoopy with me. I lay the      
 breakfast. I have Shreddies and       
 sausage sandwiches. Then I get ready  
 for school. Mum drives us. We work at 
 school all day at Maths and writing.  
 We sometimes have a swim. After school
 at home I change and take Snoopy for a
 walk up a 3 mile bumpy, stony track. I
 return and play on my bike or "off    
 ground tag" with my brother. We have  
 tea of quiche, salad and cherry pie.I 
 watch T.V. Then I bike round the      
 village till bath time. When I am in  
 bed I set my alarm to wake me at 7    
 a.m. the next day.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
