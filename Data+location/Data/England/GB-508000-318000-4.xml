		<title>04BOURNE WOODS</title>
		<content> The{landscape}of Bourne includes a big
 wood on its west side.  It stretches  
 from Bourne to Morton.  It has three  
 smaller{woods}joined onto it, Pillar  
 Wood, Auster Wood and Fox Wood.  The  
 woods used to belong to Lady Jane     
 Willoughby until three years ago when 
 her father, Lord Ancaster died and she
 had to pay off the death duty.  The   
 woods used to be part of the great    
 forest which once covered much of the 
 East Midlands.  Although the woods now
 belong to the{Forestry Commission}the 
 public are allowed to enjoy walks     
 provided in it and to watch wildlife. 
 The main types of{trees}are Douglas   
 fir, oak, ash, beech, silver birch and
 larch.  There is a lot of{wildlife}in 
 the woods including grey squirrel,    
 deer, birds of prey and woodpeckers.
