		<content>  I interviewed one of the local       
 inhabitants of Tupsley. The lady told 
 me that she had lived there  for 10   
 years.                                
                                       
  She said that it is very quiet where 
 she lives and that she is happy there 
 and would not like to move.           
                                       
  I asked if she was satisfied with    
 the local amenities available and she 
 said that there were plenty. She makes
 use of a lot of the facilities. She   
 uses the shops in Tupsley quite a lot,
 but would like there to be a chemist  
 in the area to save travelling to     
 Hereford.                             
                                       
  There are 4 schools around where she 
 lives on a small estate.              
                                       
                                       </content>
