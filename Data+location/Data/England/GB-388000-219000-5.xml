 seat 160 people without overcrowding. 
  It has a big porch and a notice board
 outside.Laura Gretton paid for the    
 church to be built.When first built   
 the church served a parish of{60      
 people,but now there are about{15,000 
 people (need to use the church) so    
 they are making the church bigger.    
  The church has a vicar called{Father 
{John}and a curate called{Father Rod.  
 When it is time to go to church the   
 bells ring at about 9.45a.m..         
  Outside there is a wooden cross.In   
 1985 it was carried to Gloucester     
 Cathederal to be blessed and then they
 bought it back again.It raised Â£700   
 for the new hall.When the new church  
 hall is completed it is going to be   
 hung on the wall.
