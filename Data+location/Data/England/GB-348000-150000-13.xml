		<title>13A HOUSEWIFE'S DAY IN R.STOKE</title>
		<content> Mrs. X is a housewife living in Rodney
 Stoke. She has 2 young children and   
 has lived here for 2\ years. After    
 rising and getting the breakfast she  
 takes her older child to Play School. 
 She then returns home and spends a    
 good deal of the morning doing        
 housework. Having collected her child 
 from Play School she arranges lunch.  
 In the afternoon she usually visits   
 local friends for a chat and then     
 returns home to prepare tea for her   
 family. She cannot shop in the village
 since the only shop is a small Post   
 office and this is soon to close down 
 so all provisions must be purchased   
 outside the village in{Wells}or       
{Cheddar.}Bulk buying and the use of a 
 freezer help to offset the costs of   
 travel involved.
