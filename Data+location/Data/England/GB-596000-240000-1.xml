The children of Boxford School         
conducted the Domesday Project in and  
around Boxford and found that the land 
in this area is mostly used for        
growing crops. Little has changed in   
the area over many years apart from    
three new housing developments in      
Boxford with another under             
construction.  The area surveyed       
consists of the village of Boxford and 
small hamlets surrounding it such as   
Groton and Edwardstone. Boxford is a   
small village with a river running     
through it called the river Box.  It   
has approximately 1500 inhabitants.
