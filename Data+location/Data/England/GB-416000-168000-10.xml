		<title>10ROADS THROUGH MARLBOROUGH</title>
		<content> A glance down Marlborough High        
 Street would reveal the importance of 
 transport in this                     
 town's history, and to a certain      
 extent its present situation. The     
 scattering of inns hotels and tearooms
 indicates the transitory nature of the
 crowds of people who use              
 Marlborough as a major stopping point 
 on the main road (A4) between Bath and
 London. Marlborough's role in         
 transport began in Roman times, when  
 close by was the intersection of Fosse
 Way and Watling Street. In the 18th.C.
 it was an overnight stop for the      
 coaches, and travellers were housed in
 an inn now part of Marlborough        
 College. The Building of the M4 has   
 reduced Marlborough's role in         
 transport links, but heavy juggernauts
 still cause problems in the town.
