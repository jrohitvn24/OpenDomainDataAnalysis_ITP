		<content>The {school} has placed 2150 16 year   
olds on {work experience} since 1975.  
Pupils   gain one week's experience in 
their choice of work. Within our       
survey-area  only seven {employers}    
have taken our pupils - 2 farms, 1     
haulage contractor, 1 garage workshop, 
1 primary school, a  manufacturer of   
timber doors and window frames (since  
closed down) and Prinknash Abbey.      
It is hoped this year that about 150   
young people will be placed in a       
similar number of locations of work.   
Most employers are based in Gloucester 
Cheltenham, but some are at a far      
greater distance - the furthest being  
Southend in Essex.                     
During the decade of the scheme, some  
200 different employers have given     
their help to the school in offering   
places to 5th formers.
