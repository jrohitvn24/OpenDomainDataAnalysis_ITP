		<title>19A TYPICAL DAY</title>
		<content> To my dissapointment I find the school
 open,with kids screaming in the       
 playground,the bell then goes for     
 registration,and I tumble in with the 
 rest of the crowd.                    
  After assembly we have two           
 lessons,they go as smooth as a        
 rock-cake.After that follows a quarter
 of an hour breather,a space between   
 lessons called break.                 
  After third lesson comes dinner,I    
 queue up in the sandwich line,and go  
 up to the library to read books all   
 dinnertime.                           
  When the bell goes I'm off home,I    
 arrive tired and worn out.I start to  
 relax in my armchair then "Get        
 changed" my mum bellows out.          
  I start then doing my homework,it    
 begins straight after tea,then spend  
 the rest of the evening,sitting down  
 and watching T.V.                     </content>
