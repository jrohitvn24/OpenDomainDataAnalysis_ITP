		<title>09The Sutton Housing Trust</title>
		<content>     These houses are private and the  
 people who live there are mainly      
 elderly.   They rent the houses from  
 the Trust.   This has an office at the
 entrance to the estate.   In the      
 middle of the estate is a garden where
 people can sit out in warm weather.   
 Behind this is a tennis court.   The  
 houses themselves have been newly     
 painted.   Coal shoots lead down from 
 the road to inside cellars.   The     
 whole area is clean and well kept.
