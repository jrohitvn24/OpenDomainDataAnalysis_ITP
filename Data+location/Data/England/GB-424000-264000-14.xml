		<content> Ena Hunt,born 1906,lived in Hunt      
 Cottage,Budbrooke.Attended new school 
 in Hampton on the Hill.Only pump in   
 schoolmasters yard.Each morning a boy 
 filled a bucket with water and put it 
 with a mug in corridor so that        
 children could have a drink in day -  
 rather dirty by 4.Stove in Infant     
 room.Teacher made cocoa in cold       
 weather.Children who lived a distance 
 away stayed dinner.A treat was to be  
 given a penny to buy a tin of bloater 
 paste from the post office to put on  
 bread.The Vicar was 'Dodger'Hunt.Said 
 to be because he dodged choir boys to 
 put off paying them.Every one went to 
 church,families from big houses having
 own pews.Children sat in front of     
 verger and if shuffled during sermon  
 hit with cane.Church cleaner's girls  
 always had nice hair ribbons-taken off
 the flowers sent to funerals.         </content>
