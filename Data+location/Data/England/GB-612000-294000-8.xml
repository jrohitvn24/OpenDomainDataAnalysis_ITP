		<title>08MODERN DAY FARMING</title>
		<content> Agriculture is probably the most      
 efficient industry in the British     
 Isles,although over_production has    
 caused surpluses in grain,milk,beef,  
 butter &amp; sugar.Huge 12'_20' combine   
 harvesters,multifurrow ploughs &amp; 40'  
 sprays are now in use.Only the larger 
 estates employ workers,most are family
 run farms.The last local farm worker  
 became redundant recently.            
 What a wonderful job plant breeders   
 have done with modern technology. We  
 have arrived at the computer age with 
 milk recording, pig live weight gain  
 per kilo meal &amp; beef fattening.This is
 all,I guess,for the young generation. 
 With roadside sales &amp; Pick Your Own   
 maybe the only thing elderly farmers  
 can do is sit back &amp; say{"Thanks for  
{the memory". }
