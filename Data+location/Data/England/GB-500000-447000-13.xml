		<title>13St. Mary's Church, Watton</title>
		<content> The parish church of Watton stands    
 within the precincts of the ruined    
 Priory. Built of brick, the church    
 dates from the 14th Century, perhaps  
 early Tudor, but contains evidence of 
 late 15th Century and late 16th /     
 early 17th Century additions and      
 alterations.                          
 The church consists of Chancel,       
 Nave, South Porch and low Western     
 Tower. The Nave holds seating for     
 around 150 worshippers. Its roof is an
 open gable supported lattice of       
 moulded, coloured beams, decorated    
 with bosses of carved faces and       
 shields. The font (perhaps Early      
 English) is said to have been found in
 a nearby field. Some old bells are    
 displayed at the west end of the Nave.
 These were replaced in 1891 by the    
 present peal of 8 Harringtons patent  
 tubular bells.                        </content>
