		<title>08Thoughts of an Italian boy</title>
		<content>   My name is{Angelo Castaldo}and I am 
 ten years old. I came{from Italy}three
 years ago when my father's job brought
 him here.                             
   When I arived I{spoke no English}and
 I did not make friends easily.        
   I found it hard to settle until I   
 had learned some English because I did
 not understand the lessons. Now I have
 many English friends and my teachers  
 tell me that I never stop talking.    
   This school is very small compared  
 to my school in Rome. We only used to 
 have one playtime a day whereas the   
 children here have three each day.But 
 the school work is much the same-too  
 hard and lots of it.                  
   I would have liked to stay here     
 another year and finish my primary    
 schooling but my father returns to    
 Rome this summer.Now I wonder if I    
 shall remember Italian on my return.  </content>
