		<title>17OLD FARM HOUSE HORTON.</title>
		<content>                                       
 My house,built around 1830,is         
detatched;originally it was brick,but  
it has recently been rendered white.   
Until the 1950's it was a farm,owning  
most of the surrounding land.Now most  
of it has been sold-but we are left    
with a two-acre garden. In some ways   
Old Farm is slighty unusual:for        
example,most boilers would use         
oil...ours burns wood.The beams and    
bricks are far older than the house-   
three,maybe four hundred years in age. 
The pantry has become a bathroom,and   
the three enormous upstairs rooms have 
each spilt in two. Adventures are      
often:as the other week,when we took   
the ancient roof of and it rained...A  
nest of young   blackbirds in the      
woodshed,or water from a standpipe     
for nearly a month.And my road is      
called Old Farm Close!                 </content>
