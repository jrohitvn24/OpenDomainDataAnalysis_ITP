		<title>10Sandringham Pheasantries</title>
		<content> Twelve keepers are employed to        
 maintain and improve the habitat for  
 the estate's game-birds. These birds, 
 Pheasants, Partridges and ducks are   
 truly wild since no birds have been   
 reared since 1939. The keepers find   
 nests and visit them daily to ensure  
 that as many eggs as possible hatch   
 successfully. In addition, they       
 maintain hedges and copses, plant     
 shrubs and clear the more dense       
 undergrowth. Vermin is controlled,    
 principally foxes and rabbits.        
                                       
 Shooting plays an important part on   
 the estate and reaches its climax in  
 January when The Court is in          
 residence.
