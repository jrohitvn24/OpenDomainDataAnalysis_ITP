		<content>   Our area is attractive and is       
 fortunate to have several old         
 houses,large and small and of varying 
 dates.                                
   By far the most interesting house in
 the area and indeed in this part of   
 Somerset is LYTE'S CARY.Lyte's Cary   
 house was from the thirteenth to the  
 eighteenth century the home of the    
 Lyte family,from which of course it   
 takes its name.There is a minstrels'  
 gallery which has an open timber roof 
 with angels.Swans and horses have been
 moulded on a plaster ceiling,more are 
 outside a bay window.                 
   John Lyte and Edith Horsey had a son
 called Henry who made a garden here   
 and wrote about it in a book          
 called'LYTE'S HERBAL'.Lyte's Cary     
 House was given to the National Trust 
 by Sir Walter Jenner in 1948.
