		<title>17VILLAGE CHILDREN,SPARSHOLT.</title>
		<content>  In Sparsholt village there is very   
 little for children to do during      
 their leisure time.There used to be a 
 youth club held in the village        
 hall,but it was stopped because not   
 many children attended.               
  There are no parks or clubs except   
 for the village green in Woodman      
 Close,where the children play.It      
 would be more fun if there were       
 slides, swings and roundabouts.       
  A lot of the teenagers go and hang   
 around the bus shelter and talk, ride 
 their BMX bikes and do stunts.It is   
 difficult for them to go into the city
 of Winchester,which is about five     
 miles away because they do not have   
 transport and the last bus is at      
 7.00p.m.                              
  The cricket and fooball club are the 
 only clubs in the village but you have
 to be a member.                       </content>
