		<title>12FRECKLETON MUSIC FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>Freckleton Music Festival originated in
1939 thanks to the efforts of County   
Councillor Richard Spencer M.B.E. who  
to this day in the cornerstone of the  
festival.He not only performs much of  
the prelimanary work but is there,his  
white carnation in his button-hole,    
introducing all the items and          
adjuidicators.Musicians and choristers 
come from all over the Northwest and   
Yorkshire to take part in this village 
prodution,indeed choirs from Wales have
performed here competing with others   
from other parts of England.Only the   
top adjuidicators are invited as judges
and high standards of music must be    
attained for a choir or solo artist to 
achieve a prize.Strike Lane C.P. school
has won the "Iddon Trophy" for junior  
school choirs for the past three years.
