		<title>02SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content>  The sewage works are situated to the 
 south of Lime Vale Road. They deal    
 with all the houses and shops in the  
 Billinge area. The first process combs
 the larger pieces of waste away. The  
 storm tanks collect the excess rain   
 water,it returns to the pipes when the
 level drops.                          
  The sewage then has the smaller bits 
 of waste removed by a revolving drum. 
 The dirty water is then filtered,by   
 going through lots of layers of stones
 where bacteria eat all the waste      
 before it is emptied into a stream    
 which takes it to Carr Mill Dam. The  
 water sent out of the works is 80%    
 pure water, it is not fit to drink.   
 . The waste that is left is put into  
 beds to dry out, it is then taken away
 by a private contractor who eventually
 sells it as fertiliser.Only two men   
 work at the sewage works.             </content>
