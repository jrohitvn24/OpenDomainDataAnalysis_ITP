		<title>10THE FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA</title>
		<content>   The world was horrified when the    
 BBC released pictures of Ethiopians   
 under famine conditions.The pictures  
 showed children with hardly enough    
 strength left to move.The groups      
 already helping to relieve them       
 e.g.OXFAM were under pressure.        
   The functions organised by Bob      
 Geldof have raised over 40 million    
 pounds.The main aid has been given by 
 the younger generation who have       
 decided that something should be done 
 as the governments were not doing all 
 they could to help.                   
   The aid will be given to help       
 provide much needed food.
