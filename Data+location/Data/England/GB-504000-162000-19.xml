		<title>19Commuting</title>
		<content>    The life of a commuter is the same 
 tedious and boring routine everyday.  
    Many of the people in this area are
 commuters to London.                  
  A commuter's alarm bell rings at 6.00
 to 6.30 in the morning for the        
 journey to London is about 1 hour and 
 a half to two hours depending on the  
 traffic.You get up and wash, you then 
 get dressed which will take about half
 an hour; you then go down stairs and  
 have breakfast this will take about   
 10 minutes along with your drink of   
 orange juice or coffee whichever you  
 prefer.Into the garage where you climb
 into your company car.Throw your      
 briefcase into the back seat and hang 
 your jacket up.                       
    Push the keys into the ignition and
 turn the key.It starts first time     
 along with the radio the news bulletin
 comes on at 6.45. Oh no!you're late,  </content>
