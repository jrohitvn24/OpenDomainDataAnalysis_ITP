		<title>01        Winsford</title>
		<content>  Winsford has an indigenous           
 population which has remained         
 relatively stable. During the last    
 thirty years people from the{overspill
{of Manchester and Liverpool}have moved
 to the area.                          
    Physically,the town is divided into
 the districts of Wharton and Over by  
 the River Weaver.                     
    Down the road from Wharton is      
 Meadowbank. It is just a cluster of   
 houses but very interesting because   
 Winsford's{salt mine}is situated      
 there.                                
    Winsford has a new industrial      
 estate but there is still high        
 unemployment.   Many of the houses are
 council houses.
