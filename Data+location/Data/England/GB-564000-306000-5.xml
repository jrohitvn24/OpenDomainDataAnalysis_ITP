		<content>  No longer do all the parents work in 
 the villages or on the land. Most     
 parents now work in King's Lynn or    
 Downham Market.                       
  The employers in the villages are    
 farmers,a coach company,petrol station
 and small builders.                   
  The Forestry Commission used to      
 employ a few people, but this is now  
 centred at Thetford Forest.           
  Quite a large number of people work  
 at nearby R.A.F. Marham as personel or
 in the ancilliary services.           
  Much of the female population does   
 find seasonal work at the orchard in  
 Shouldham Thorpe or by going to pick  
 soft fruit in the Fen area.
