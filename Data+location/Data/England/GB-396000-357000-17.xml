EVERY WEEK ON TELEVISION THERE IS A    
PROGRAMME CALLED "TOP OF THE POPS". ON 
THIS PROGRAMME YOU CAN SEE AND HEAR THE
ARTISTS AND GROUPS WHO HAVE SOLD       
THOUSANDS OF RECORDS. EACH WEEK A CHART
IS PUBLISHED TO SHOW WHO HAS SOLD THE  
MOST RECORDS. MY FAVOURITE GROUP ARE   
CALLED  "DURAN DURAN" AND THEY ARE     
ALWAYS AT THE TOP OF THE HIT           
PARADE BECAUSE THEY SELL A LOT OF      
RECORDS.                               
MY SISTER LIKES A GROUP CALLED "WHAM!" 
AND WE OFTEN ARGUE ABOUT WHICH IS      
THE BEST GROUP. AT HOME, WHEN WE       
PLAY OUR RECORDS MY DAD COMPLAINS      
ABOUT THE NOISE AND HE SAYS THAT THE   
MUSIC HE LISTENED TO WHEN HE WAS YOUNG 
SWAS BETTER THAN THE MUSIC WE HAVE     
TODAY. MY MUM SAYS IT IS'NT BETTER OR  
WORSE JUST DIFFERENT.
