		<content>   The  view  across the  River Thames 
 from  Clifton  Hampden  parish church 
 is  much  photographed. The church is 
 situated  on  a  rocky  spur  which   
 rises  quite  steeply above the river.
 Looking  upstream  the  dominant      
 foreground  feature  is  the  bridge  
 across  the  river.  This  bridge was 
 built in  the  1860's to  replace the 
 ferry which had, until then, conveyed 
 travellers  across  the  river.  John 
 Casey, the  last  ferryman, built the 
 bridge  himself  from bricks baked on 
 Clifton  Heath.  He  then  became the 
 first toll keeper.                    
                                       
   Although the  bridge was freed from 
 tolls in 1947 and both the bridge and 
 Bridge House, the old toll house, now 
 belong  to  the  Local  Authority     
 descendants of John Casey  still live 
 in Bridge House.                      </content>
