		<title>06The Haltwhistle-Alston Line.</title>
		<content>    The third railway line used to go  
 to Alston - the highest market town in
 England.  It was a single track line. 
 The diesel train went to Alston.  Then
 the driver got in the other end and   
 drove back to Haltwhistle.  The line  
 was closed down on May 1st 1976       
 because it was getting old.  The      
{Lambley Viaduct}was becoming unsafe.  
 British Rail pulled up all the tracks.
    They built a new all-weather road  
 to Alston.  There is an United bus    
 service from Haltwhistle to Alston.   
 It costs{75p}to travel to Lambley from
 Haltwhistle and it costs{Â£1.15}to     
 travel to Alston.                     
    In a bad winter the road gets      
 blocked with snow.  The railway never 
 got blocked as much as the road.      
    My Dad and everybody else likes the
 railway better than the road.
