		<title>19LONGCLIFFE ECOLOGY CENTRE</title>
		<content> Our class visited the Ecology Centre  
 on May 23rd.  These are some of our   
 observations.                         
   "Most interesting were the rhodo_   
 dendron hills.  It was there that we  
 saw huge sets which belonged to the   
 badgers.  We found the main entrance  
 and some new holes." (Sarah)          
   "I counted the spots on ladybirds.  
 I saw some with ten and others  with  
 only two spots." (Samantha)           
   "We measured some trees.  The Scots 
 Pine was nearly 22 m high and its     
 girth was l l/2 m" (Abigail)          
   "I enjoyed the uprooted tree.  It   
 was hidden by bushes and was lying on 
 its side.  It was higher than me and  
 the roots were covered in clay"(John) 
   "I found a centipede and a milli_   
 ped. I saw a millipede open its full  
 length and I saw one in a little      
 ball." (Matthew)                      </content>
