		<title>12CASTLE DONINGTON PWR STATION</title>
		<content> CASTLE DONINGTON POWER STATION WAS    
 BUILT IN I959. IT COST Â£3O MILLION AND
 AT THE TIME WAS THE BIGGEST IN WESTERN
 EUROPE. IT MADE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION  
 TO THE PROVISION OF BRITAIN'S         
 ELECTRICITY AS IT WAS VERY EFFICIENT  
 AND PRODUCED MORE ELECTRICITY THAN ANY
 OTHER BRITISH POWER STATION FOR FOUR  
 YEARS. IT IS A COAL-FIRED POWER       
 STATION POSITIONED NEAR TO THE EAST   
 MIDLANDS COALFIELDS AND ON THE BANKS  
 OF THE RIVER TRENT. THE STATION HAS   
 SIX IOOMW TURBO ALTERNATORS.  IT IS   
 NOW A TWO-SHIFTING STATION AND IS USED
 TO BOOST THE POWER SUPPLY AT TIMES OF 
 HEAVY DEMAND. THE GENERATORS CAN BE   
 SWITCHED ON WITHIN MINUTES OF A       
 REQUEST FROM THE GRID CONTROL         
 ENGINEERS. WHEN CONDUCTING OUR SURVEY 
 THE CHILDREN FROM OUR VILLAGE SCHOOL  
 WERE WELCOMED BY POWER STATION        
 STAFF AND TAKEN ON A CONDUCTED TOUR.  </content>
