		<title>02Chatteris - Drainage History</title>
		<content> We found out that the Fens around     
 Chatteris used to be swamps covered   
 with reeds.  Groups of people lived on
 the little gravel islands which stuck 
 up out of the bog.  The people grazed 
 their cattle on the islands and dug   
 peat out of the bogs to burn in the   
 winter.  The Romans came and tried to 
 drain the area and so did the Nuns who
 founded the Abbey in Chatteris, they  
 did not succeed and the Fens stayed   
 mostly under water.  In 1630 the      
 Dutchman, Cornelius Vermuyden, came to
 drain the area and in 1650 the Sixteen
 and Forty Foot drains which drain our 
 section of Chatteris were cut.  We    
 found out that the numbers tell us how
 wide the drains are, and that they    
 have not changed very much since they 
 were first dug.
