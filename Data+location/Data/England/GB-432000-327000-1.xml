 This is a rural area situated 4\ miles
 south of the city of Derby in the East
 Midlands.                             
  Within the 12\ Km section there is 1 
 village,Barrow_on_Trent,and 2 hamlets 
 Twyford and Ingleby plus 16 farms.    
  These settlements are situated within
 the flood plain of the River Trent    
 bounded by the River Trent to the     
 south,and the Trent_Mersey canal to   
 the north.                            
  The area is principally one of       
 farming with the dominant agriculture 
 being Dairy farming, but many of the  
 inhabitants of the settlements are    
 commuters working in Derby.           
  There are many interesting features  
 in the area such as the old church at 
 Twyford,a hermits cave at Ingleby and 
 the relief of the area which has been 
 moulded over many years by the Trent. </content>
