		<content> THERE ARE MANY FOOTPATHS THROUGH THE  
 WOODS AND FIELDS. PEOPLE USE THEM     
 FREQUENTLY BUT TO ENSURE THEY ARE KEPT
 OPEN A FOOTPATH WALK IS HELD ANNUALLY.
 A LOCAL FARMER HAS ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE 
 ONE.                                  
 A SURVEY OF OAK TREES WAS UNDERTAKEN. 
 THIS INCLUDED THE "JUBILEE OAK"       
 PLANTED BY THE CHURCH HALL IN 1935 TO 
 COMMEMORATE THE SILVER JUBILEE OF     
 GEORGE V. 243 OAKS WERE COUNTED IN THE
 VILLAGE. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE    
 MANY OAK TREES IN THE WOODS. THE AGES 
 AND SIZE VARY, BUT THE MAJORITY ARE   
 ENGLISH OAKS, QUERCUS ROBUR. OF THE   
 RECENTLY PLANTED OAKS 3 ON BUNKER'S   
 HILL WERE PLANTED IN 1971. THESE WERE 
 A GIFT TO THE VILLAGE. AN ELM TREE    
 (IMMUNE TO DUTCH ELM DISEASE) WAS     
 PLANTED IN THE SCHOOL GROUNDS IN 1982.
