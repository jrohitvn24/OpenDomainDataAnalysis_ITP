		<content> Ten people were asked about their     
 favourite{T.V. channel}and{Newspaper} 
 in the Repton and Newton Solney area. 
 Most people gave a definite answer but
 a few did not have any one favourite. 
 The 'Daily Telegraph' was easily the  
 most popular newspaper with the       
 'Express' coming second - the 'Times' 
 only had one vote, this was a rather  
 surprising result.                    
 The favourite T.V. channel was I.T.V  
 and people seemed to think it gave    
 more entertainment and was generally  
 the best.                             
 Channel 4 was the second most popular 
 and most people thought that it had   
 got off the ground very well.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
