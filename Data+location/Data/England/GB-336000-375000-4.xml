		<title>04THE MAYOR OF ELLESMERE PORT</title>
		<content>   This year, the{Mayor}is Mr.Evans,who
 lives in{Church Lane,}Great Sutton. He
 told us that all the farmland in the  
 area once belonged to the Church.     
 Services were held in Church Farm     
 until the Church was built. He showed 
 us how{times have changed;}for example
 an old lady who lived in Great Sutton 
 evicted the occupants of eight        
 cottages opposite her house. She then 
 demolished six of the cottages merely 
 because they spoiled her view. Could  
 this happen today?                    
    The{roads have improved}since the  
 Council took over their maintenance.  
 The Mayor remembers cars getting stuck
 in the potholes outside his house. He 
 feels that houses should be built,    
 allowing more room for extensions. He 
 was worried that{public footpaths  }  
 (a relic of former rural times) may be
 lost through lack of use.             </content>
