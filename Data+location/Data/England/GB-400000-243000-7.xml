		<content>    I belong to a{club,}it is{Cubs.}In 
 it we play games. We go every Monday. 
 If you like it you get invested and   
 you buy a uniform which is a jumper,  
 scarf and cap and some grey trousers. 
 We go camping and not long ago we went
 to London. Sometimes we cook things   
 and eat them ourselves. When we come  
 back from a trip we draw a picture of 
 things we saw and do a bit of writing 
 about it. I enjoy Cubs very much. The 
 time we have to be there to start is  
 six o'clock and the finishing time is 
 half past seven so we have a lot of   
 time to play games and draw pictures  
 and write about things. We do a lot of
 things in our Cub-Scout hut.
