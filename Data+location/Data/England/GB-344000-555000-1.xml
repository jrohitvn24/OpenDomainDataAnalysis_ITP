		<title>01WARWICK BRIDGE AREA</title>
		<content> The area is a rural one with several  
 small dormitory villages for Carlisle.
 The River Eden,one of the few in the  
 country that flow North,runs through  
 the area and if you can afford it     
 there is good salmon fishing.         
 There is no Primary Industry apart    
 from Farming.                         
 There is variety in every aspect of   
 the area,especially in houses and     
 jobs.                                 
 People live in the area but tend to   
 leave it for work or entertainment.   
 Pretty though it is there is little   
 tourism,people pass through without   
 stopping.                             
 A major feature of the area is the    
 Trunk road A69 Carlisle to Newcastle. 
 It provides speedy commuter travel and
 keeps the lanes free of traffic but is
 dangerous for children and speeds     
 potential visitors away.              </content>
