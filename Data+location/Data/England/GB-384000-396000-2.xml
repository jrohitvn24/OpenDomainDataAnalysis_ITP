		<content>  In recent years the city centre has  
 been transformed by new developments. 
 The Deansgate/Market street           
 intersection has been redeveloped and 
 much of Market street has been        
 pedestrianised. This latter section   
 has become the focus of shopping      
 activity in the city centre. It has   
 also led to the development of        
 cultural activities with street       
  musicians actively busking           
 and sometimes artists working on the  
 pavements.                            
  Off Market street access can be made 
 to the large shopping complex of the  
 Arndale Centre. The tiles on the sides
 of this development are not one of the
 planners' better decisions. Part of   
 this centre is a new bus station.     
  The most attractive pedestrian scheme
  has been done in St. Annes' square   
 which is less busy than Market Street.</content>
