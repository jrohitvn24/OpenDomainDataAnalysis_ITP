		<content> Will Shores tree was planted by Will  
 Shore.It is a sycamore tree.Will      
 Shore was one of two brothers.They    
 both planted trees.Will lived a normal
 life but his brother died and his tree
 died as well.There is a poem written  
 about the trees when they were first  
 planted.This was written as the poet  
 was driving along the A6 in 1828.The  
 first line says 'Tis said that to the 
 brow of yon fair hill'. The hill the  
 poet is talking about is Oaker Hill.  
 In summer we slide on cardboard down  
 the slopes and in winter we sledge.   
 When it is snowy we can see rabbit and
 fox tracks.There are many walks on    
 Oaker Hill.In 1979 the residents of   
 Oaker planted an American Oak to      
 replace the tree planted in Jubilee   
 year that had died.
