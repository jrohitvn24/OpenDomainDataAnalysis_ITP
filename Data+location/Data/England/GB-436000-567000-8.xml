		<title>08SHOPS AND TRADE IN TYNEMOUTH</title>
		<content> The shops in Tynemouth are mostly     
 fairly small, often family-run shops  
 catering for the local population.    
 There are a number of shops catering  
 for the everyday needs of the         
 residents but there are no department 
 stores. For this kind of shops, the   
 new integrated transport system       
 comprising the Metro rapid transport  
 tramway and bus services put the city 
 of Newcastle upon Tyne within easy    
 reach.                                
 A growing number of shops cater for   
 visitors and tourists - antiques,     
 paintings and crafts - and some of    
 these have been built in a converted  
 church to make an attractive shopping 
 mall - The Land of Green Ginger. There
 also a number of restaurants and      
 take-away hot food shops.
