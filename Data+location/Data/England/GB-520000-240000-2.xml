		<title>02FARMING AROUND HINXWORTH</title>
		<content> The land around is all agricultural; 2
 large farms of 350 acres each and     
 several small holdings of about 40    
 acres. Crops grown include: wheat,    
 barley,oilseed rape and break crops of
 linseed, peas and beans. All work is  
 done with machines:tractors,3 furrow  
 reversible ploughs, harrows, sprayers 
 and fertiliser spreaders; this cuts   
 down the necessary work force to 2-3  
 men per large farm with extra at      
 harvest time.                         
 Middle Farm has a large grain drier   
 which also dries for other local      
 farmers.                              
 The average working week before       
 overtime is 40 hours from 7:30 am to  
 5pm with breaks for breakfast and     
 lunch; the top craftsman's wage Grade 
 1 is just over Â£3 per hour although   
 extra is paid for overtime. At harvest
 time a 90 hour week is not uncommon.  </content>
