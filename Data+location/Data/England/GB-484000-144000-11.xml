		<title>11CLASS 1L's BOURNE WALK</title>
		<content>      Our class went for a walk around 
 the Bourne area. We walked down Mavins
 road which used to be a field where   
 the school treat used to be held with 
 Mrs Anderson, who was the vicar's     
 wife.                                 
 The children who went on the treat    
 went by cart and some walked.         
      The church was terribly small and
 could seat roughly ten people. It has 
 since fallen down, and a stone marks  
 the spot where the altar used to be.  
 All that remains is an overgrown      
 graveyard and a lych-gate.            
      This church was replaced by St.  
 Thomas on the Bourne.                 
       We walked down Vicarage Hill to 
 Paradise Woods past The Spotted Cow   
 Pub and talked about how people used  
 to make their own beer. Farnham used  
 to be famous for its hops but they do 
 not grow them any more.               </content>
