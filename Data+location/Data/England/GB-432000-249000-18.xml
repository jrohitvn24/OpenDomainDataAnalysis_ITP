		<content> A volunteer Fire Brigade was formed in
 Kineton by{Lord Willoughby de Broke * 
 in 1885. The centenary fete, this     
 year,was opened by his grandson David.
                                       
   Today Kineton is in the Leamington  
 Division of the County Fire and Rescue
 Service and is a part-time retained   
 station manned by 2 full-time officers
 (for day-time cover) and 11 fireman.  
 The Station Officer is also           
 responsible for fire precautions in   
 the area.                             
   The engine is a general purpose     
 water tender which carries 1800 litres
 and general fire-fighting equipment   
   Over recent years the appliance has 
 been called out an average 100 times a
 year.                                 
{ * Willoughby de Broke's}owned much of
    the land around Kineton until the  
    1960s.                             </content>
