		<content> People who live in this area are quite
 lucky. They are reasonably well off   
 although there are some poorer people 
 in the villages.  Most people live in 
 a semi-detached house they have a     
 family with two or three children.    
 Pets are vey popular because there is 
 plenty of room for dogs.  In cities   
 there is nowhere for dogs to play so  
 most people have cats. Some people    
 have horses. Alot of children have    
 their own computers and they play     
 games on them. people also watch T.V. 
 alot some have video recorders and can
 watch films. This is good as there is 
 no cinema. Boys usually play out after
 school but girls go to each others    
 houses and play games with dolls.     
 Adults can watch T.V. or do jobs about
 the house. In summer they dig the     
 garden and grow flowers.
