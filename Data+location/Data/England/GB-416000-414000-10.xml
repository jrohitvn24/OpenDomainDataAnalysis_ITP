		<title>10LEISURE: Brass Bands</title>
		<content>    Cornets, horns, flugels, baritones,
 euphoniums, trombones, basses and     
 percussion are all needed to make up a
 successful Brass Band like{Scissett   
{Youth Band}with whom I play the Tenor 
 Horn.                                 
    Tenor Horns come with three        
 different finishes: frosted which is  
 dull and looks rather like car bonnets
 look when the night has been frosty;  
 silver, which is real silver-plating  
 on a brass base; gold which is not    
 really gold but brass.                
    When the tenor horn plays with a   
 band it quite often has the rhythm to 
 play. You have to learn to double and 
 triple-tongue for this.               
    All in all  I enjoy my hobby very  
 much and think I will go on playing   
 the horn for nearly, if not all, of my
 life.
