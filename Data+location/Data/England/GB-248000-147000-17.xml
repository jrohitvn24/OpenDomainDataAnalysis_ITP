		<content> The are seven main points on our coast
 I think that Ilfracombe has a very    
 extraordinary coast.Mostly it is steep
 cliff and the land stucture is made up
 of slate and sandstone.Capstone holds 
 the British flag, many people say that
 Capstone was once an island long ago. 
 Flat point and Brandy Cove are both a 
 part of the National Trust.           
 Ilfracombe's water supply comes from  
 Slade reservoir which is a mile away  
 from our area.A lot of chlorine is    
 used to purify the water.Ilfracombe   
 being in a southern area has not got  
 much flouride in the water.The        
 National Trust is a protection against
 animals and woodland.The land is kept 
 to its natural resources and most of  
 them are open to the public(e.g Brandy
 Cove area).Capstone and Hillsborough  
 both have rabbits, foxes and voles.The
 areas both are bracken and heath.     </content>
