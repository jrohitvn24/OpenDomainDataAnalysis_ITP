		<title>11Porthgwarra Cove, St. Levan.</title>
		<content> Porthgwarra is a{fishing cove}with a  
 'slip' for small boats. A winch is    
 used to pull them up the slip. There  
 are various types of fish off the     
 coast, also crabs and lobsters. Only  
 two men use the cove regularly today. 
{They catch crab and lobsters}which are
 stored in other pots at sea near the  
 cove, then sold at{Newlyn Fish Market.
 Centuries old stone storage tanks were
 used until heavy seas damaged the     
 wooden covers recently.{Miners dug the
{hole in the cliff years ago so farmers
{could take seaweed for manure with a  
{horse and cart,}another tunnel allowed
 access to the storage tanks.          
{Mr. Leslie Trewern,}who fishes from   
 Porthgwarra,{uses a fibre-glass hulled
 boat which is about five metres long. 
 It has a Stuart-Turner{petrol engine  
 and he always takes a small{two-way   
{radio in case of emergency.}(cont.)   </content>
