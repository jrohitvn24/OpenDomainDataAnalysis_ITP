		<content> Although the National Trust own most  
 of the land around the Slindon part of
 our block, Courthill Farm is leased   
 out to Mr. James Langmead. His farm   
 Manager is Mr.Budd, and he employs 10 
 men.This particular farm has over     
 10,000 acres, but only a small part of
 this is in our block.The land is split
 up into different crops: wheat,barley 
 and grassland for grazing. The farm   
 owns 1,300 pigs,most of which are     
 weaners and 130 milking cows. The     
 heifer calves are kept, but the bull  
 calves are sold for beef at 7 days    
 old. The output of milk is 1,300      
 gallons per cow per year. It takes 1  
 hour 20 minutes to milk them.         
 The farm machinery consists of 4      
 combine harvesters,1 bailer and 11    
 tractors with attachments. They mill  
 and dry their own food and store it in
 barns,and they cut and store silage.  </content>
