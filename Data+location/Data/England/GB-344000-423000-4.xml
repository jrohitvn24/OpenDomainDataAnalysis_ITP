		<content>  There has never been much industry   
in this area. Horticulture and         
agriculture take up much of the land.  
  There used to be Bentley's brickworks
in Longton but this closed in 1964.    
Farther back there were also two       
breweries in Longton and a jam         
producer.   In the 1880's a cotton     
mill opened in Walmer Bridge. It was   
powered by the River Walmer. It was    
very noisy. It provided work for       
people from Longton and terraced       
houses and a school were built to cope 
with the increase in population.       
  The mill closed in the 1930's and the
land occupied by it was later used by  
Milburn Motors and as a depot by       
Caledonian Road Services. The site is  
now taken up by sheltered              
accommodation for the elderly,an       
ambulance station and two recently     
established commercial concerns.       </content>
