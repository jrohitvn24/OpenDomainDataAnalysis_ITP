		<content>{COUNCIL HOUSES: The Garth}- a small   
 estate, including a number of Airey   
 Houses (pre-fabricated pre-war houses)
 due for renovation in late 1985.      
{Little Moss}- small bungalows for the 
 elderly. This close is attractively   
 laid out with wide grassy areas and   
 flowering trees.{Low Furness Road}- a 
 recent development on the site of the 
 old railway station.                  
{NEW HOUSING:}Under strict planning    
 control, this has mostly consolidated 
 the outline of the village. A great   
 number of new houses have been built  
 in the village since 1980.            
 A lot of houses are let for           
 holidaymakers, or are{second homes.   
 The cost of buying a house here is    
 very high; e.g. Â£48,000 for a small   
 two-bedroomed bungalow in the centre  
 of the village.                       
                                       </content>
