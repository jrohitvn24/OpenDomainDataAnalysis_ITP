		<content> UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA IS WELL BELOW
 THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. MOST PEOPLE WORK
 AWAY FROM THE AREA IN NORTHAMPTON,    
 LEICESTER AND SOME COMMUTE TO         
 LONDON.THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE 
 IN THE VILLAGES  DO NOT HAVE UNIONS . 
 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND    
 EMPLOYEE ARE VERY GOOD, WITH LITTLE OR
 NO DEMARCATION OF TRADES. A GOOD      
 EXAMPLE OF THIS TAKES PLACE AT        
 HOLDENBY WHERE THOSE VILLAGERS        
 EMPLOYED BY THE ESTATE CAN ONE DAY BE 
 DRIVING A TRACTOR AND THE NEXT TAKING 
 MONEY AT THE GATE OF THE HOUSE.       
 FARMERS IN THE AREA ALL BELONG TO THE 
 NATIONAL FARMERS UNION WHICH LOOKS    
 AFTER THEIR INTERESTS NATIONALLY.     
 FODEN LEATHER COMPONENTS HAVE A       
 FACTORY IN SPRATTON WHICH EMPLOYS     
 APPROXIMATELY 40 PEOPLE. HIGHGATE     
 HOUSE PROVIDES DOMESTIC WORK FOR A FEW
 LOCAL WOMEN.                          </content>
