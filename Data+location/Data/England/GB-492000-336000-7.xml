		<content> The estate had remained in the        
 hands of the Brownlow family from     
 1620 until 1983 when the trust        
 purchased the house and part of       
 the grounds for the people of this    
 country. Elegant and symmetrical      
 the house is a living tribute to      
 the past and its thousands of         
 annual visitors a sure sign that      
 20th C Britain remembers its roots.   
 The interior of the house is equally  
 attractive and interesting.  A fine   
 marble hall leading up and out to a   
 host of splendidly furnished rooms    
 many designed by famous architects    
 like Sir Christopher Wren and         
 furnished and furnished by past       
 specialists like Grinling Gibbons.    
 Many famous visitors, past and        
 present, royal, political, and social 
 have stayed in the house.  Now  it    
 truly belongs to the people.          </content>
