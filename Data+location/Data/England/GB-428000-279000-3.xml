 When they were younger both men were  
 very much involved in sport - "in     
 those days people had to make their   
 own amusements." Life in Allesley was 
 much quieter then with hardly any cars
 and no buses. There was a weekly visit
 from the grocery van - the order was  
 given one week and delivered the next.
 The only village shops were a butchers
 and a bakers. The biggest changes in  
 Allesley over the last sixty years are
 the loss of so many fields to housing 
 and the loss of much wildlife; the    
 increased noise from traffic is also  
 notable. None-the-less both men prefer
 Allesley as it is today with all the  
 modern ammenities.                    </content>
