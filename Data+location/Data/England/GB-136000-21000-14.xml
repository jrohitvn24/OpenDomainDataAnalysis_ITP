		<title>14St. Levan Parish Church (1)</title>
		<content> The name St. Levan comes from St.     
 Selevan, believed to be a Celtic      
 Saint who landed at Porth Selevan, now
 known as Porth Chapel, the cove lying 
 a few hundred yards from the Church.  
 From the{Norman Conquest until 1864}it
 was a chapelry of the{Deanery of St.  
{Buryan.}It now forms part of a united 
 benefice with St. Buryan. Until 1832, 
 the Church and Churchyard formed part 
 of a small hamlet which included an   
 Inn, which may have stood on church   
 property.{The Holy Well and Bapistry  
 of St. Levan lie{beside the footpath  
 leading from the road{to Porth Chapel 
 Beach. They are connected to the small
 Chapel on the cliff edge further down 
 by a flight of about fifty stone      
 steps. Water from the Holy Well was   
 used for Baptisms, and is still used  
 on occasion at the present day.
