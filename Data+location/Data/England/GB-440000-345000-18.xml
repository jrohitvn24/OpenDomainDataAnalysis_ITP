		<title>18THE OPENCAST SITE (ONE)</title>
		<content> They started mining in 1981 and it is 
 a ten year project, so it is due to be
 finished in 1991. 16000 tonnes of coal
 is produced a week and is taken to    
 Bennerley. One of the trucks on the   
 opencast site is the biggest in the   
 country.The truck picks up 50 tonnes  
 of coal every time and weighs 100     
 tonnes. The trucks cannot work in the 
 rain because the wheels are made of   
 rubber and they soak up the rain. The 
 opencast has a lot of regulations and 
 the most important ones are safety    
 regulations. On the opencast site they
 have got 70 trucks. When the trucks   
 have finished their jobs they are     
 dismantled and taken to a different   
 site. When we went to the opencast    
 site we met Mr.Walker who is the      
 coalboard representative. He was a    
 civil engineer and he progressed to   
 get the job at the opencast.          </content>
