		<content>My name is Debbie. In my spare time I  
go riding and I read.I started riding  
when I was two. My mum bought me a     
pony from a riding school and she      
taught me how to ride.When I was a bit 
better at riding my mum took me hunting
and she led me.I like riding because I 
can go onto the moor.I ride at shows, I
hunt and things like that. I read in my
bedroom where it is quiet. I like      
reading because there are alot of good 
stories I enjoy.                       
                                       
My name is Charlotte. In my spare time 
I go roller-skating and running. I go  
roller-skating around the road and     
running on the fields. I go running    
because I am quite good at it. I like  
roller-skating because I have some     
skates.
