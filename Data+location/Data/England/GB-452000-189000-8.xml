		<content>In 1981 the population of Didcot was   
15,418.  It is estimated that in five  
years from 1985 the population will be 
20,000.  There are 1414 Council houses 
in 1985.  304 will be built within 5   
years.  There are 3100 private houses  
in 1985.  1200 more are expected to be 
built within five years.               
There are several new estates in       
Didcot, including Barleyfields,        
Millbrook and Hagbourne Downs.  At     
Barleyfields there are 3\4 bedroom     
detached houses and two-car garages.   
All the 35 detached houses at Hagbourne
Downs have two gardens.  In August 1984
the buildings were begun at Millbrook. 
Most of the 118 buildings, which       
include some flats, had been sold by   
June 1985.  These are all semi-detached
and have two gardens.  Some of the     
houses have one bedroom.
