		<title>05CARS IN 1985.</title>
		<content> We gathered information on new cars   
 and secondhand cars by sending letters
 to garages.People buying new cars     
 spend about Â£6,OOO.A new idea today in
 cars is a turbo engine and an         
 injection engine which makes cars     
 faster.                               
 The secondhand car most people buy is 
 the Ford.Most people buy secondhand   
 cars because new cars are too         
 expensive.Secondhand cars lose their  
 value every year.People buy small     
 secondhand cars which don't use much  
 petrol.                               
 Not many people walk to work in       
 1985.Motorbikes are common as well as 
 cars.The price of petrol in July 1985 
 is Â£2.O5.
