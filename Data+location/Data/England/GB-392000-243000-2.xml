 The ground undulates gently from the  
 river and the area is dominated by the
 bulk of distant {Bredon Hill}in the   
 South East.  It is a{rich growing}    
 area, soft fruit and salad vegetables 
 are produced in the many market       
 gardens which proliferate in the area.
 Cattle and sheep graze on the rich    
 grassland but some concern has been   
 expressed locally by the death of the{
{Heron}population, due it is thought,  
 to the use of over powerful pesticides
 being washed down to the river from   
 bordering fields.                     
{Flooding}is notorious and efforts have
 been made to alleviate it by          
 controlling the river flow using      
 sluices and "guts" to run off flood   
 water.  Despite flooding the Avon     
 attracts an increasing number of      
 tourists to the area.                 </content>
