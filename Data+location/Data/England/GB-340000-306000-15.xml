		<title>15FARMING IN PONTESBURY.</title>
		<content> All the farms in the area are         
 productive and efficient, ranging from
 17 acres up to 1100 acres.  Stock on  
 these farms varies greatly but the    
 majority of systems are intensive.    
 One farm has 800 pigs, 8 cattle, 15   
 sheep, 3 acres of grass and 10 acres  
 of barley.  The largest farm has 1100 
 acres which consists of: 200 grass,   
 650 cereal, 50 rape and 200 sugar     
 beet.  Their stock consists of        
 seasonal grazing animals, 160 beef    
 cattle and 200 sheep.  Occasionally   
 they rear up to 3000 turkeys.  On the 
 dairy farms the herd numbers vary from
 35 - 100 animals - British Friesian - 
 and these are kept on as little as one
 acre of grassland per animal.         
                                       
 None of the farms had a wide variety  
 of stock or crops but all tended to   
 specialise on one or two systems.     </content>
