		<title>06   WATER  FOR  LEWES</title>
		<content>      The{river Ouse}is tidal at Lewes,
 flowing between earth banks raised to 
 prevent{flooding.}Its tributaries have
 sluices to prevent tidal flow:the     
 Cockshut, the Winterbourne and the    
 Glynde Reach. The Winterbourne flows  
 mostly on porous chalk and dries up   
 from April to December.It last flooded
 in l974, inundating the station,      
 Priory Lower School and many houses.  
      The Ouse is little used now, only
 for angling and pleasure boats from   
 Lewes Rowing Club.It is full of odd   
 craft in the annual May Raft Race.    
     {Lewes Water Supply}is mostly     
 groundwater pumped at Southover from  
 the chalk to reservoirs, then flowing 
 by gravity to users. It is very pure, 
 needing no filtration. Malling uses   
 river water from Barcombe Mills       
 reservoir.{Lewes' sewage}goes to the  
 l9th century works for sedimentation. </content>
