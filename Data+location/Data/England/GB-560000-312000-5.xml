		<title>05The Turkey Farm</title>
		<content> To the east of St.Germans village,    
 there is a specialised farm for       
 rearing turkeys. This comprises a     
 series of large sheds with domed      
 roof / corrugated sheet construction. 
                                       
 Norfolk provides many of the turkeys  
 required for British tables, and the  
 meat is increasingly popular          
 year-round (perhaps because it is less
 expensive than beef!!).               
                                       
 The turkeys live in large groups,     
 completely indoors, on a deep sawdust 
 floor, with controlled light,         
 ventilation and heating.              
                                       
 The farm rears them from eggs, and one
 section kills and prepares them for   
 the processing factory which          
 transforms the meat into joints,      
 burgers etc.                          </content>
