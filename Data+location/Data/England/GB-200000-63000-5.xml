		<title>05LANIVET PARISH CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church is in the centre of the    
 village opposite the school. The      
 earliest religious building on the    
 site was probably a celtic monastery  
 though this may have been at nearby   
 Lamorick.A church stood on the site in
 Norman times but the church of today  
 is a restored fifteenth century       
 building.The first rector is listed,  
 however, in{1259.                     
 The church was restored in{1865.}It   
 has a square tower housing bells,     
 large perpendicular windows and six   
 interior arches made of St.Stephen's  
 stone.Lanivet is part of the{Bodmin}  
 team ministry and it has a daughter   
 church in Nanstallon.Communion, family
 services and evensong are the regular 
 services.The Rev. Tony Olivey is a    
 welcome visitor at the school each    
 week.
