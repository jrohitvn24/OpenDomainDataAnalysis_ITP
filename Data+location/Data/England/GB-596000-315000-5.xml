		<content>        {STUCK IN THE MUD}             
 Only 11 people at the most can play   
 this game. One person is called       
 'it'.Everybody else takes hold of a   
 finger of whoever is 'it'.The person  
 who is 'it' says a sentence like "I   
 went to the woods and I got stuck in  
 the .....". When the person says mud  
 everybody leaves go of the person's   
 fingers and runs away. The first      
 person touched by 'it' becomes 'it'   
 and the game starts again.            
 The object of the game is never to be 
 caught and become 'it'.               
 We play this game at playtimes,       
 along with other games like British   
 Bulldogs, Sticking Glue,Coloured Eggs,
 rounders and football.
