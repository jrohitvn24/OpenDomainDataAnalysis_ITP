		<title>02LEIGHTERTON VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  Leighterton is a tiny village which  
 lies just to the east of the A46      
 Stroud - Bath road. It is part of the 
 parish of Boxwell. It has been        
 described as "a knot of stone barns   
 and cottages among a tangled skein of 
 lanes".                               
  The village is built round the 14th  
 century church (restored in 1877) and 
 the Royal Oak, "more likely a village 
 pub than many in Cotswold." Most of   
 the inhbitants are retired, a few work
 on the scattered farms or else they   
 commute to Tetbury or Bristol. There  
 are 86 on the present roll of         
 electors. What little social life     
 there is, is centered on the pub, the 
 church and the small village primary  
 school. Many of the school children   
 are bought in by bus from the area.
