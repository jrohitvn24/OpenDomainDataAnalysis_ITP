 Mr. Lea lives on a mixed farm of 250  
 acres. The farmhouse is 140 years old.
 His family has lived there since 1912.
 At present he has 86 dairy cows, 120  
 beef cows, 105 sows, 5 boars and 30   
 litters of piglets. He has 3 workers  
 besides himself.                      
 The dairy cows are fed on "cake" made 
 of wheat and barley. They also eat    
 silage or graze the pasture in summer.
 The pigs eat 5 kilogrammes of "cake" a
 day and drink 3 gallons of water. Each
 sow has an average of 27 piglets a    
 year in 3 litters. Last year this farm
 had the best record in the country.   
 The farmers day begins with telephone 
 calls and giving his men their        
 instructions. Then he inspects the    
 animals, helps feed them and scrapes  
 the farmyard.                         </content>
