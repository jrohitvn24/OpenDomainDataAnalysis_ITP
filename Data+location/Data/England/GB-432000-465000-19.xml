		<title>19Newby Hall, Bishop Monkton</title>
		<content> Newby Hall is a Wren-style house built
 in the 1690's,set in 25 acres of      
 magnificent garden on the north bank  
 of the River Ure.                     
 It is the home of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Compton, 
 whose family have occupied the house  
 since 1748.                           
 The original house was extensively    
 remodelled by local architects in the 
 18th. century,wings were added and    
 a new entrance constructed.           
 Robert Adam was called in to improve  
 the reception room,including the      
 Sculpture gallery built to house the  
 Roman Sculptures and Gobelin          
 tapestries. The rooms are beautifully 
 decorated to display the priceless    
 furniture including some Chippendale  
 pieces.                               
 The hall and gardens are open         
 to the public during the summer.
