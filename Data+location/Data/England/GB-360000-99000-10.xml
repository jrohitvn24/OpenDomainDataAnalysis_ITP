		<content> The village has a lively group of     
 young children, under sixteen, who are
 an asset to the place.  They would    
 like more sports facilities, such as a
 tennis court, swimming pool, football 
 pitch and a field for motor cycle     
 scrambling.                           
 Also suggested was a coffee bar or    
 permanent meeting place.  At the      
 present time the bus shelter (which   
 does not get much use as there are so 
 few buses) is the meeting place for   
 all the young folk and the cross roads
 by the chestnut tree is the football  
 ground.  The young people appreciate  
 many of the same things about our     
 village life as their elders;  the    
 tranquillity, the natural beauty, the 
 security and the friendly atmosphere.
