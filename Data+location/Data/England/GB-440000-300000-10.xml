		<title>10THE BATTLEFIELD OF BOSWORTH</title>
		<content> History has recorded that on 22nd     
 August 1485, Richard III, King of     
 England, engaged Henry Tudor, Earl of 
 Richmond, in the final battle of the  
 War of the Roses.                     
 It is generally held that the battle  
 took place on a site which now        
 constitutes part of the privately     
 owned Ambion Hill Farm and            
 consequently a major part of the      
 actual battlefield has been subjected 
 to intensive farming.                 
 In 1974 a Battlefield Centre, housing 
 a comprehensive collection of relics, 
 exhibits and displays, was opened at  
 Ambion Hill and exteded in 1985 in    
 preparation for the quincentenary     
 celebrations.                         
 A commemorative service is held on the
 battlefield site each year as a       
 memorial to the soldiers that were    
 killed in the battle.                 </content>
