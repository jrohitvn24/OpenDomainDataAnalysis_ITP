		<title>16VILLAGE LIFE</title>
		<content> A survey of the village was carried   
 out by top Juniors from Englefield    
 School. Their findings showed that    
 almost every household contained a    
 telephone. There is also one public   
 telephone in the village. Two daily   
 postal deliveries are made in         
 Englefield and collections made from  
 the three post-boxes at 09:00 and     
 16:45. These post-boxes are all       
 Elizabethan and free standing. They   
 are situated at Parker's Corner, near 
 Chalkpit Cottages and outside the     
 village post-office. The post-office  
 offers a variety of services including
 stamps, postal orders, savings, Giro  
 Bank, licences, paying out pensions   
 and family allowances. The post-office
 and shop also serve as a central place
 in village life passing on information
 and providing a place to meet. Papers,
 milk and groceries are picked up here.</content>
