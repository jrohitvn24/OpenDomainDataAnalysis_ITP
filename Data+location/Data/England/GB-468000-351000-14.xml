  I came from{Sunderland.}I was born in
{Northallerton,}then I moved to{       
{Sunderland}to a village called{Cleadon
 It was good there and I cried when we 
 moved to{Southwell}but I like it here 
 best.It is so pretty here and sunny{  
 in{summer.}When we had sun at Cleadon 
 the sea{fret}came and{spoilt}it all.  
{                                      
{Chris                                 
 I used to live in{Guiseley}in{West    
{Yorkshire.}I think it was a bit better
 than{Southwell}because it less        
{dangerous.}There were{fewer main roads
 but it wasn't famous for anything.It  
 had two parts, {New Guiseley}and{Old  
{Guiseley. Old Guiseley}has been there 
 for about{2000}years so it is about { 
{1000}years{older}than{Southwell.
