		<content>      In the playground of St.Andrew's 
 school we play lots of games.  Lots   
 play marbles.  There are lots of      
 different marbles - e.g. mini, king   
 size, clear, oily and one-ers.  Lots  
 also like to play 40-40, which is like
 Hide and Seek, but in 40-40 you say   
 "40-40 see Vikky", or whoever has     
 been seen.                            
                                       
      We like playing Chains, when     
 somebody is in the middle and calls   
 someone's name and they have to try to
 get past.  If they touch the person,  
 he/she has to join the chain.  If     
 he/she does get across, the rest try  
 and follow.  Another popular game is  
 Hop Scotch.  You have to throw a stone
 and try to get it on a series of      
 numbers and hop along them.  If you   
 don't get it on, it's another's turn.
