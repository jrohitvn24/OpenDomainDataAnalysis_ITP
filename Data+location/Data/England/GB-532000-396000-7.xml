		<content>    As can be seen from the previous   
 few pages, there are many sporting or 
 recreational facilities in the area.  
 The questionnaire that we completed by
 asking local people (see page 19 ) how
 much they used these facilities shows 
 that, apart from the village hall, it 
 is mainly people from outside our area
 that use them. The fishing ponds ,    
 riding school , and particularly the  
 water-sports centre were not used much
 by locals , but were nevertheless very
 busy indeed at this time of year.     
   The village hall was extremely well 
 used by the majority of the local     
 population of all ages. The vast      
 variety of events and functions held  
 there justify the cost of replacing   
 the old hall with the new one.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
