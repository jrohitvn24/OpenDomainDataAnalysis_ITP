		<content>Generally women seem to do more house  
hold tasks than men and girls are      
expecto do more than thier brothers.   
Was, ironing and cleaning the house are
done exclusively by women. The only    
house is done mainly by men is cleaning
ar though house hold repairs are still 
grally seen as a man's responsibility. 
Decorating, washing-up,gardening,      
baby-sitting, shopping for food and    
cooking are shared  a little more      
though still tend to be dominated by   
women. Families generally find time to 
s down together for at least one meal  
on most days. Takeaway food is bought  
as family meal occasionally, but eating
out at restraunts as a family is seen  
as a luxury rather than a common event.
