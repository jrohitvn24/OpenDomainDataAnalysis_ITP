<content>

All the churches mentioned in the 1986 entry remain open and are used for services throughout the month.However, the Church of England Combined School at Frieth is the only such school remaining in the area.&lt;br />&lt;br />Prayers for Peace are now said on a monthy basis at different churches throughout the Hambleden Valley Group of Churches.Visitors to Turville Church are encouraged to light a candle and say a personal prayer for peace.&lt;br />&lt;br />Eucharist is celebrated every Wednesday morning at Turville. This is combined with special prayers for healing on the 4th Wednesday of each month. These services are very well attended by worshippers from other parishes.&lt;br />&lt;br />Turville holds a very popular annual Service of Animal Blessing on the Village Green.In 2011 it attracted goats, a parrot, geese , rabbits and the usual cats, dogs and horses.   &lt;br />
