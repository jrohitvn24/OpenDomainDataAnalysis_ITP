		<content>     In the area covered by this       
 block there are four primary and two  
 comprehensive schools.Each child from 
 the various primary schools now at    
 eleven years of age goes on to one of 
 the two senior schools.The girls      
 attending Sandbach High School and the
 boys to Sandbach School.              
     However,prior to 1979,a different 
 system existed at the secondary stage.
 Those children who passed the old     
 eleven plus examination went to two   
 grammar schools.The girls went to     
 Congleton Grammar School,seven miles  
 from Sandbach,and the boys to Sandbach
 School.Those children who failed the  
 examination attended Sandbach         
 Secondary Modern School.              
     With reorganization in 1979       
 Sandbach Grammar School became the    
 boy's comprehensive and the Secondary 
 Modern the girl's comprehensive.      </content>
