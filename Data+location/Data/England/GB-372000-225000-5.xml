		<title>05Shopping in Newent</title>
		<content>  A survey showed that there were two  
 main groups of shoppers:              
   {1.}Newent residents                
   {2.}People from the outlying areas  
       who use either bus or car, they 
       may have come 5 miles to shop.  
  There is a wide range of goods and   
 services in Newent and it was felt    
 that prices were quite competitive.   
  A further group did their daily      
 shopping in Newent but chose to visit 
 Gloucester and the larger supermarkets
 there for the family shopping either  
 on a Thursday or Friday evening or a  
 Saturday morning. The reasons given   
 were mainly convenience of parking and
 the wider range of goods available.   
  Two interesting shops have recently  
 opened, a whole food shop (people are 
 thinking about their diet);and a tool 
 hire shop (more leisure time and many 
 do their own house and car repairs).  </content>
