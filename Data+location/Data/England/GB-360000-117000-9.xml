		<content>    Most of the buildings outside the  
 Sherborne area are old and are built  
 of{local stone,}many of them are{     
{ thatched.                            
 These buildings are either farm       
 buildings or isolated dwellings. There
 are a few newer properties near the   
 golf-course.                          
    The area within Sherborne contains 
 a{council-house}estate of five roads. 
 The houses here are built of{brick }  
 with either{slate}or{tiled}roofs. A   
 number of these houses have recently  
 been bought by their tenants. The     
 remaining residential streets in the  
 area have a mixture of old stone      
 buildings and a larger number of brick
 buildings between fifty and a hundred 
 years old. There are two small estates
 of{new houses.}                       
    Along the A.30 there is a row of 6 
 small shops and a new fire-station.   </content>
