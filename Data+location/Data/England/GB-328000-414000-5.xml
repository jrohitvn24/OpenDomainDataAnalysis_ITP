		<title>05BIRDS ON THE COAST</title>
		<content>   On the Sefton shoreline vast areas  
 of mudflat and sandbank are exposed   
 when the tide goes out.Large flocks of
 wading birds feed in winter on the    
 foreshore between the Ribble Estuary  
 in the north and Liverpool to the     
 south.Oystercatchers,Sanderling,      
 turnstone and redshank are likely to  
 be seen on the beach at high tide.    
 Black-headed, herring,lesser black-   
 backed and common gulls can be seen   
 gathering to roost at dusk.The        
 foreshore is part of the Southport    
 Bird Sanctuary, which includes the    
 nearby  Ribble Estuary, and is an     
 internationally important area because
 of its flocks of wintering and passage
 birds.These migrating birds include   
 many species of wildfowl and waders,as
 well as several species of tern.Large 
 flocks of the rare pink footed goose  
 fly over and roost in this area.      </content>
