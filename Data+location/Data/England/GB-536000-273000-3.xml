		<title>03TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> During the week 10th_14th{June 1985,} 
 Mrs. Catton's class did a traffic     
 survey in{Earith High Street.}Every   
 day of the week between{9.45 am}and{  
{10.15 am,}we went to do our{count.}   
 We found on{Monday 134, Tuesday 92,   
{Wednesday 176, Thursday 57}and{Friday 
{118 vehicles}passed through. This     
 suggests that Wednesday is the busiest
 day although we cannot think why, as  
 there is no local market. Monday and  
 Friday were also very busy, being the 
 beginning and end of the week.        
 We also looked at the vehicles        
 registrations and found about{50%}were
 local{Peterborough}numbers.We found   
 about{20%}of the vehicles were{       
{lorries.}We found quite a few{buses,  
{tractors}and{trailers}on Thursday and 
 Friday. We also saw an{ambulance,     
{police cars, post office van}and a{   
{dust cart. }                          </content>
