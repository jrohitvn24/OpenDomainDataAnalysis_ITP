		<title>05FARMING IN CHURCHILL</title>
		<content>  The land is suitable for growing     
 wheat and barley and each farm grows  
 as much as it can.   One has oilseed  
 rape and sometimes peas as "break"    
 crops to give a more balanced         
 rotation.   The second has a herd of  
 120 milking cows, all Holstein        
 Friesians, and rears its own          
 replacement heifers.   They graze on  
 grass leys in the summer, but are kept
 inside for the six winter months and  
 fed mainly on silage.   A small       
 acreage is made into hay.             
  The third is also a stud farm and has
 3 stallions.   Through the summer as  
 many as 130 mares will have their     
 foals there, and then stay on for 12  
 weeks or so until they are safely in  
 foal again.
