		<content> Saxonbury Farm is a red-brick farm    
 near Mark-Cross.The farm used to be   
 bigger,but when the farmer's father   
 retired,he sold some of the farm which
 is now Colesgrove Farm.               
   Saxonbury Farm has always been a    
 sheep farm and the present farmer has 
 farmed it for 34 years.He has 200 Kent
 ewes and 5 Dorset Down rams.In 1985 he
 had 300 lambs and they were born in   
 April-early May.He has one sheep-dog  
 called Meg and 15 fields.When the     
 lambs are 40kg they go to Lamberhurst 
 or Heathfield markets.When the lambs  
 are slaughtered nothing is wasted.The 
 skins go to a craftsman who makes     
 rugs,coats,gloves etc,and the bones   
 are made into fertilizer or vitamin E 
 and the feet are made into glue.
