		<title>14HALLATON BOTTLE-KICKING 1</title>
		<content>{Bottle-kicking}and{hare pie scrambling
 take place on Easter Monday. They are 
 centuries old customs for which Halla-
 ton is famous, at least throughout the
 county. The origins, probably         
 connected with fertility rites, are   
 lost in history.  Crowds of several   
 hundred gather in Hallaton, and the   
 three pubs are open for most of the   
 day. Some villagers participate: some 
 leave for the day. The morning is     
 taken up with a band playing first in 
 Medbourne where the opposing team     
 comes from, then around Hallaton from 
 the Bewicke to the Fox, thence to the 
 church where there is a service. After
 lunch the large hare pie, made to a   
 secret recipe by one of the women of  
 the village, is paraded from the Oak  
 to Churchgate, where it is cut up by  
 the Rector and some of it thrown to   
 the crowd.   (cont on page 15)        </content>
