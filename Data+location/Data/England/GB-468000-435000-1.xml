		<content> This block is a rural area about 11   
 miles S.S.E of York and is crossed by 
 the River Derwent flowing             
 N.W./S.E..The river is the boundary   
 between Humberside to the east and    
 North Yorkshire to the west.          
 There are two main settlements North  
 Duffield and Bubwith. North Duffield  
 (pop. approx 500) is a friendly       
 attractive village with a village     
 hall, new primary school, Methodist   
 Chapel, sub-post office, shop and     
 public house. It has a central village
 green and duck pond.                  
 Bubwith has rather more facilities,   
 such as fish and chip shop, antique   
 shop and timber yard. On the bank of  
 the River Derwent is the old church,  
 now a shared place of worship.
