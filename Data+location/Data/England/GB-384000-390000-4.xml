		<title>04LOCAL ISSUES, DIDSBURY</title>
		<content> One of the issues local people in     
 Didsbury, Withington and Burnage feel 
 strongly about is education. A few    
 years ago Manchester wanted to close  
 its school sixth forms and set up     
 sixth form colleges instead,but the   
 Secretary of State for Education said 
 that certain schools (two of which are
 in our area), should retain their     
 sixth forms. Manchester is now        
 attempting to reorganise to a tertiary
 system and the school sixth forms are 
 again at risk. There is substantial   
 disagreement surrounding these plans. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
