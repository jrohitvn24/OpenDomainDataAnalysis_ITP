         {TRELISKE HOSPITAL}           
          _________________            
      Treliske Hospital is the         
 biggest hospital in the Truro area.   
 Although it is sizeable, the hospital 
 does not provide a casualty           
 accident/emergency service; the City  
 Hospital, near the centre of Truro, is
 where the closest casualty department 
 can be found. Treliske Hospital       
 usually caters for general illnesses  
 and often important operations.       
      Treliske Hospital was built      
 in the past 20 years on a vast open   
 site on the western edge of Truro.    
 Among the major buildings there are   
 hostel blocks for residential staff, a
 Post-graduate school, and a separated 
 block housing the Princess Alexandria 
 Maternity Wing.
