		<content> The{PRAM RACE}takes place in          
 Edenbridge every year, run by the     
 Edenbridge Round Table. It consists of
 teams of three people who push some   
 sort of pram from pub to pub.The money
 raised goes to charity.It has been    
 going for ten years.This year there   
 wasn't a pram race because there were 
 so many events on in Edenbridge,that  
 the police wouldn't shut the main road
 for the pram race and most of the     
 public went to other events.          
{THE EDENBRIDGE AND OXTED AGRICULTURAL 
{SHOW}takes place every year in August 
 in a field off the main road at the   
 southern end of Edenbridge. The       
 agricultural show has tents that are  
 full of art and craft,leather         
 garments, flowers, cattle, sheep and  
 a dog racing course....by Anita       
 Cross and Michelle Hewlett.
