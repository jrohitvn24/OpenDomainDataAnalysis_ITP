   The three hundred and sixty acres   
 which comprise the{Berkshire Golf}    
{Courses}was all once part of Windsor  
 Forest.  That is until around 1817 and
 the Enclosure Acts.  This area then   
 became{Crown Estate}land.  Between the
 Wars few houses were built in this    
 area, then with the post-1945 Town and
 Country Planning Acts it was          
 designated{"Green Belt"}and so        
 protected from any major development. 
   Plans for a{Golf Club}in this area  
 were laid in 1920 and the course and  
 club were opened in 1928.             
   The{geology}of this area includes   
 Bagshot Sand upon London Clay, which  
 provides a natural habitat for Scots  
 Pine, Silver Birch, Oak and Spanish   
 Chestnut.
