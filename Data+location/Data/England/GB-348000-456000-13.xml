		<title>13The Notable Event</title>
		<content> On the 27th April 1985 the University 
 had a 21st Anniversary Open Day from  
 10am to 6 pm.  It was packed with     
 17,000 visitors. The special          
 attractions were 'Deal with a world   
 crisis', 'Exploit the Morecambe gas   
 field', 'Build a Doric arch','Visit   
 the coldest place on earth' and many  
 side shows which included film,       
 theatre, music, scientific            
 demonstrations, sport, children's     
 activities and refreshments.  They had
 so many visitors that extra car parks 
 were needed on the grassy areas.  The 
 weather was rather poor and it was    
 supposed to have affected the number  
 of people attending the open day.  The
 last open day in 1980 had 1,000 more  
 people and it was a much nicer day.
