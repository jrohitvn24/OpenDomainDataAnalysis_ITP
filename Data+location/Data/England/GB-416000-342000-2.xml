 There is one very big lake on Colonel 
 Stantons estate with two swans and    
 five cygnets. At one time there were  
 two hundred Trout but most of these   
 have now been fished. At one end of   
 the lake is a boat house the boats    
 were kept underneath. And  above is   
 a room where the ladys had tea and    
 watched the gentlemen boating and     
 shooting.                             
  There are also two smaller lakes     
 which Colonel Stanton  has made       
 recently. Round the house are gardens 
 where many flowers are growing,Some   
 of these are quite rare.At this time  
 of the year (June) there are banks of 
 azaleas and rhododendrons. Another    
 featur is a wood full of Monkey Puzzle
 trees.
