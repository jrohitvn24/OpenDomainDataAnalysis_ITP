		<content>{THE OLD RECTORY }which dates back to  
 1291, at least, is now divided into   
 three houses. A window from the old   
 church has been installed in the      
 house.                                
 One of the most famous people to live 
 in the village was{Bernard Shaw,}a    
 dramatist,who wanted to change English
 spelling so that it would be easier.  
 He was also a vegetarian.He bought the
{New Rectory}in 1906 renaming it  {    
{Shaw's Corner.}Probably his most well 
 known play is{Pygmalion}better known  
 as{My Fair Lady.}He printed postcards 
 to send to people who bothered him for
 money or advice.They were very witty! 
 His home was Shaw's Corner until he   
 died in 1950 aged 94.He gave the house
 to the National Trust just after his  
 wife died,in 1943.
