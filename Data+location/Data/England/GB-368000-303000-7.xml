		<title>07AQUEDUCT SCHOOL EXTENSION</title>
		<content> Children came flooding into the new   
 estate and so the school became       
 overcrowded. A new extension had to be
 built. Just before summer 1984 the    
 builders started to move in. First of 
 all they cleared the site and created 
 a mound with all the waste.Then the   
 site was fenced off.After the         
 foundations were dug they filled up   
 the bottom half with concrete and then
 built a wall seven bricks high for    
 protection.They then put in a damp    
 proof course.At that point they had   
 reached floor level.Brick by brick,   
 step by step the walls crept slowly   
 upward.The builders had to work 39    
 hours a week.When the building is     
 completed it will be inspected and if 
 there is nothing wrong it is accepted 
 by the county council.It has rained a 
 lot so the extension will not be      
 finished until October 1985.          </content>
