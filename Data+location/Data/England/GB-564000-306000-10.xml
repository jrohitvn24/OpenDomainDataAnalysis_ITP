		<content>   Many of the older buildings contain 
 stone from the Gilbertine Abbey. These
 can be seen towards the base of some  
 houses on the Green.                  
  Local flint, carrstone and locally   
 made bricks are much in evidence and  
 many roofs are slate.                 
  Quite a proportion of older houses   
 have rendered exteriors.              
  One of the oldest houses is Colt's   
 Hall and was mentioned in the first   
 Domesday book.                        
  The houses on the Green are a mixture
 of cottages and conversions. One was a
 public house, and behind the shop is a
 caravan site with some 19 residential 
 caravans.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
