 The area round here is very chalky    
 with a little clay.  It is not very   
 sheltered because there are only a few
 trees.                                
 The area is mostly chalk downland,wide
 open spaces with big fields and       
 very few hedges. It gets pretty windy 
 some times because of the open spaces 
 and the few trees or hedges.          
 The village of Ogbourne St George is  
 in the valley of the river Og.  The   
 river Og dries up each summer, it is a
 very slow running river and it is not 
 very wide.
