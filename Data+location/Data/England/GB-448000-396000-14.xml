		<title>14The Game of Girls Girls Out</title>
		<content> "Girls,Girls,Out" is played on a two  
 square by three square rectangle.     
 Starting in the bottem left hand      
 square and going anti-clockwise, the  
 squares are lettered (G)irls, (B)oys  
 (C)olours, (A)nimals, (F)ruit, and    
 (C)ountries. One player then jumps on 
 the square marked G and says, "Girls, 
 girls, out.", and jumps out of the    
 square. Then they jump back in the    
 same square and shout, "Girls, girls."
 The player then jumps to the square   
 marked B and says the name of a girl  
 twice. The jumping continues anti     
 clockwise shouting a different girl's 
 name in each square until the player  
 gets back to the start. The game      
 starts again on the square marked B,  
 and the call is for boy's names. The  
 game continues with colours, animals, 
 fruits and countries. The game stops  
 when the players have had enough.     </content>
