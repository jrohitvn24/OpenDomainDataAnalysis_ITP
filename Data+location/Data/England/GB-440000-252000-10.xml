 On Monday,I woke up,had breakfast and 
 caught the school bus. We had time for
 a game of 'tig' on the playground     
 before the bell went. After the       
 Register,we had Assembly with a story,
 a prayer and a hymn. This week, we are
 thinkingabout homes, and today it was 
 Dr. Barnado. In History, we are       
 studying early man. In Maths, we work 
 from workcards. I'm on multiplication,
 and I like it. Our dinner is cooked in
 the school kitchen.It was beefburgers.
 In the dinnerbeak, I had a recorder   
 lesson, and it was my turn to play on 
 the computer.I played on tyhe climbing
 apparatus,too.In the aftrenoon, we    
 built a model woolly mammoth. The     
 School Bus came at 3.15 p.m.After     
 watching some TV at home,we had tea.I 
 played on my bike, but it was soon    
 time for bed.                         </content>
