		<title>01PORTSEA ISLAND</title>
		<content>{The whole of our area has been shaped 
 by man.Modern roads almost obliterate 
 the tidal creek that,even today,makes 
 Portsea an island by joining          
 Portsmouth and Langstone Harbours.    
    The landscape is by nature flat.A  
 tree-covered ridge south of Port Creek
 is man-made:still called  the Hilsea  
 Lines it once was the defence works.  
 two major roads mark our eastern and  
 western boundaries,each flanked by    
 water and open land.Our centre is a   
 grid-pattern of suburban roads fringed
 on the east by industry and on the    
 west by navy land.                    
    Earlier landscape shows where a    
 road, instead of being straight,      
 follows a curve follows the curve     
 created over centuries by plough-teams
 turning at the edge of
