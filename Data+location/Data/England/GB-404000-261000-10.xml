		<title>10WATER IN ASTWOOD BANK</title>
		<content> The streams in Astwood Bank are not   
 all clean. In the Astwood Bank area   
 there are many brooks but             
 unfortunately some of them have been  
 polluted by everyday use. Two things  
 that have affected the brooks are oil 
 and sewage. These kill off wildlife   
 and can spread disease.               
                                       
 Since the 1980's pollution has struck 
 the Astwood Bank and Coughton areas.  
 People have actually fallen ill       
 through swallowing brook water. The   
 tap water in Astwood Bank is very     
 clear and is safe to drink.
