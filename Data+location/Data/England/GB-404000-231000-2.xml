		<title>02Stanway Area - A Poem</title>
		<content> Welcome to Didbrook,Toddington and    
                            Stanway,   
 Welcome to Wood Stanway too.          
 There's Toddington Station and Stanway
                               Grounds,
 And lots of things to tell you.       
 There's Didbrook Fields and Stanway   
                          Tithe Barn,  
 There's Stanway House and Papermill   
                                Farm.  
 There's the Quarry and Didbrook Church
 There's lots for us to search.        
 We'll tell you of the local policeman,
 We'll tell you of an Estate worker's  
                                 plan. 
 We'll tell you about the Flower Show  
 And all the things we can find out or 
                                  know.
 We will tell you of things about      
 And all of the things you might doubt;
 We'll tell you of things old and new  
 And everything we say is true.        </content>
