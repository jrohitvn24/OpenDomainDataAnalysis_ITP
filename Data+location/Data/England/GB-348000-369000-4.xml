 We are lucky to have a woodland at the
 top of our school field. In that area 
 there are 200 shrubs and trees which  
 were planted by the children in 1983. 
 They were all indigenous species.These
 are some of them; ash, field maple,   
 rowan, larch, wild cherry, birch, oak,
 guelder rose, dogwood, holly and      
 hawthorn.                             
 In the woodland there are all sorts of
 plants including; spear thistle, fox_ 
 glove, poppy, ragwort, nettles, dock, 
 dandelion, speedwell, buttercup and   
 daisy. Grasses include cocksfoot, rye,
 crested dogtail, scutch, foxtail,     
 meadow soft and meadow grass.         
 The idea of the woodland is to make a 
 nature reserve in the grounds. After 2
 years we have badgers using it as a   
 dung pit. The woodland is a great play
 area. We have already built a den.    </content>
