		<title>11My Hobby is Bowling</title>
		<content>  My club is called GKN SANKEYS.There  
 are four teams.I play in the fourth   
 team.In our area there are four       
 leagues.Our team is in the third      
 league.There are,in fact,two kinds of 
 bowling games,flat and crown green    
 bowls.I play crown green bowls.       
  This game differs from flat green    
 mainly because in flat green the      
 ground is level.In crown green the    
 ground has undulations.               
  The idea of the game is to see who   
 can place their bowls nearest to a    
 small target ball which has been      
 bowled a certain distance along the   
 green.                                
  One day I would like to play in      
 one of the biggest crown green        
 competitions called the Yorkshire Bank
 held at Waterloo in Blackpool every   
 year.
