		<content>   This area is situated in the Weald  
 of Kent just outside the town of Royal
 Tunbridge Wells. The main feature is a
 ridge running through the middle of   
 the area - the village of Langton     
 Green is situated on this ridge.      
 To the south the land falls away to a 
 valley, but to the north-west the     
 ridge opens out to a small plateau at 
 Fordcombe before falling away to the  
 Medway valley. It is a very uneven    
 stretch of land with lots of streams  
 and valleys scattered around the area.
 The two steepest hills are probably   
 Fordcombe Hill and Barrow Lane. There 
 are some fairly rocky areas, most     
 notable being the sandstone           
 outcrop at High Rocks.Most of the land
 is on a clay base mixed with sandstone
 and some chalk. It is not very good   
 for growing plants or crops. This     
 ground is called the Hasting Beds.    </content>
