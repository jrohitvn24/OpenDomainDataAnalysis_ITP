		<content>    There are no large factories in our
 area, we therefore decided to find out
 what jobs were available in the       
 village. Our survey revealed that only
 14% of those able to work worked in   
 the village. These are :-             
  {School           4 employees        
  {Fish &amp; Chip Shop  1 enployee        
  {Farming          1 employee         
  {Home Help        1 employee         
  {Dress Making     1 employee         
  {Leaton Industrial Estate  1 employee
{}                                     
    Most people work in Shrewsbury     
                                       
    Over 70% of those who were employed
 worked outside our area. The great    
 majority work in service industries   
 e.g. C.R.S. Telecom Health Authority. 
 Only 2 worked in manufacturing        
 industry - Perkins Diesel, Harlescott.
