		<title>14THE SIKH TEMPLE</title>
		<content>{by Permjit Ghataorre age 10           
 Our temple is{Ramgarhia Sikh Temple.} 
 I go to the{Sikh Temple}nearly every  
 week.The{temple}is on Foleshill Road. 
 There are two sections in the{temple.}
 Upstairs is a prayer room and there is
 a big dining room downstairs.The      
{temple}has a committee which looks    
 after the priest and the upkeep of the
{temple},it buys the plates and spoons.
 Before you go upstairs you must take  
 off your shoes.There are some sinks   
 upstairs where you should wash your   
 hands.There is a yellow carpet in the 
 room where you pray.At the end of the 
 room there is a carved wooden stand   
 nearly as high as the roof,this is    
 called the{Palkie}and this is where   
 the priests sits and reads from the   
 Holy Book or the{Granth Sahib.}The    
 ladies sit on the left and the men on 
 the right.Coventry has 15,000 Sikhs.  </content>
