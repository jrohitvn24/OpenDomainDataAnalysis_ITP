		<title>16BENTILEE COUNCIL ESTATE</title>
		<content>Bentilee estate is a large,elongated   
council development built in the l950's
on what was generally farmland between 
Bucknall and the Fenton/Longton built  
up areas.Apart from local re-housing,  
some of the original inhabitants were  
miners having moved here with their    
families from other parts of Britain,  
to work in local pits.This is true also
of the Berry Hill Council Estate lying 
between Bentilee Estate and Eaton Park.
The estate has its own shopping        
precinct,a health clinic,a day care    
centre,a library,three primary and one 
secondary school and two churches.     
Amenities have more recently been      
improved by the provision of a state   
day nursery,a sub-police station at    
Bucknall and landscaping of green      
spaces and play areas.As the houses    
were built without garages,some parking
areas and garages have been provided.  </content>
