		<title>01The area around Rivenhall</title>
		<content>   Our area includes a small country   
 village and the outskirts of a town.It
 is a very rural area.The village is   
 Rivenhall and its neighbouring town is
 Witham.Both are near a major road,the 
 A12,which is a main road to London.In 
 Rivenhall there is a Saxon Church     
 standing on a site over 1000 years    
 old.The area is surrounded by fields, 
 woods and farmland.                   
   There are eleven farms and four     
 schools in the area.Three of the      
 schools are primary schools and one is
 a secondary school.There are eleven   
 fairly small shops,two of which are   
 general village stores.               
   The outskirts of Witham comprises a 
 newly built estate which houses many  
 people who have moved out of the      
 London area.
