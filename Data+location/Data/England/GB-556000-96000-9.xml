		<content>    Even though the winters are very   
 harsh on the Downs, the cattle and    
 sheep are kept warm. In very bitter   
 winters snow often covers the         
 pastures. In this weather the sheeps  
 or cows are put in sheds and given    
 bales of hay for bedding and food. As 
 the farms can have no silage, hay is  
 sparse during the winter.             
    The oats and barley that is grown  
 is all sold off at the corn exchange. 
 Even though Britain has much corn, it 
 needs harder grain to make bread than 
 is grown here. At the exchange the    
 corn is bought by the big companies.  
 Most of the dairy products are also   
 sold to these companies. The few      
 calves that are reared for beef are   
 sold at markets. As the grazing where 
 the sheep are kept is rough, the sheep
 are kept for wool rather than mutton. 
 The sheep are also sold at market.    </content>
