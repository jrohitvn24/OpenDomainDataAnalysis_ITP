		<title>11Outside Weare Church</title>
		<content> St.Gregory's church is situated on the
 edge of the village of Weare in       
 Somerset.It was built about 500 years 
 ago.Over the ages houses have been    
 built around it. The oldest houses are
 nearest the church. The church is set 
 on a slight  hill and is surrounded by
 gravestones. The oldest gravestone is 
 dated 1570. Many of the names on the  
 gravestones are the same, the most    
 common being Day and Ham. The church  
 itself is built of stone and  the     
 walls are about 70cm thick. The main  
 door is arched and made of very thick 
 oak. The church has a tall            
 perpendicular tower with a golden     
 weathercock  on top. It also has a    
 flagpole where the Union Jack is flown
 on special days. Around the top of the
 tower are 8 gargoyles. These are to   
 help the water escape from the flat   
 tower roof. (Cont on page 12)         </content>
