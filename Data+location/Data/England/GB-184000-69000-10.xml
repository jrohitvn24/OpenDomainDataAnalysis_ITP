		<content> Nearly all of the houses in Treburrick
 had only been built about 2 years     
 ago.Some were used as holiday flats.  
 The roofs of the houses were mainly   
 made from tiles or slate. There were  
 no thatched roofs around. The oldest  
 house we came across was 400 year old.
 In Penrose the surroundings were      
 horrible. It was very junky and the   
 cottages wer all mouldy with          
 oldness.One house had a roof that was 
 part Cornish slate and part tile. One 
 of the houses in Pwnrose used to be   
 the village Post Office. Then it was  
 made into a Tailor shop.In Penrose    
 most of the houses were fairly old. At
 the top end of the village were 4     
 council houses.They were build at the 
 end of the war in about 1944-45;the   
 roofs were made of concrete tiles.
