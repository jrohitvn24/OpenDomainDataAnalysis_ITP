		<title>07Pendomer: Woodland</title>
		<content> There are two principal areas of wood-
 land - Pen Wood, which is mainly      
 coniferous, and Coker Wood where      
 broadleaf trees predominate. In       
 addition there are some small patches 
 of wood which may have begun as fox   
 coverts.                              
 Pen Wood belonged to the Forestry     
 Commission until a year or two ago and
 was open to the public, with a car    
 park, picnic site, footpaths and even 
 an informative leaflet. It was a      
 popular venue for school groups and   
 others and it seems a pity that the   
 present private owners, the pension   
 fund of an industrial corporation,    
 have not been able to continue to     
 grant access, in an area where public 
 open space is all too rare.           
 Coker Wood is also privately managed  
 and is not open.
