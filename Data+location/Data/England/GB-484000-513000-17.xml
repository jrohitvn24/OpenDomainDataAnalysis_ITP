{MULGRAVE ESTATE:-}                    
 The Mulgrave Estate has been in       
 existence for centuries and           
 consequently has a deep influence on  
 the area.Prior to the Norman Conquest 
 it was thought to be owned by Suuen-a 
 Dane.Since 1086 it has been owned by  
 the Fossard,the de Mauley, the Bigod, 
 the Radcliffe,the Sheffield and the   
 Phipps families.The present Marquis is
 the 4th in the line and was Lord-Lt.  
 of the N. Riding from 1965 to 1974 and
 since 1974 Lord-Lt.of North Yorkshire.
{ALUM WORKS:-}The art of alum making   
 came to the area from Italy.An alum   
 works was started at Sandsend Ness    
 about 1615. This brought employment   
 and wealth to the area and since its  
 decline this has not been replaced.
