		<content> Among a variety of arable and         
 livestock farms in the area is Brandon
 Farm, from which the farmer has       
 recently retired. Instead of moving   
 away, he has rented out some land to  
 be arable farmed and has sold 15.5    
 acres. The gentleman who purchased    
 this land for Â£22,000 six months ago  
 intends to grow main crops of garlic, 
 leeks and salsify. He believes the    
 combination of good soil, a           
 south-facing slope and an increasing  
 demand for garlic will provide himself
 and his wife with a good living. They 
 intend to live on the land although,  
 as yet, planning permission has only  
 been granted for a mobile home. The   
 only building on the site at the      
 moment is a large greenhouse which    
 will be used to dry the garlic and to 
 produce intermediary crops of spring  
 cabbage and french beans.             </content>
