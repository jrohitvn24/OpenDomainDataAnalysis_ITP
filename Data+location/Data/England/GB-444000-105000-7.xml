		<content> Behind the{Royal Victoria Country     
{Park}at{Netley}there is a{military    
{cemetery}which is well kept but       
 unused.There are lines of memorials to
 those who died in the two world wars  
 but there are some remembering earlier
 battles. All this is a sad reminder   
 that the human race never seems to    
 learn from it's mistakes.Some are     
 family graves from an era when        
 smallpox was a killer.We noticed that 
 many men had returned from outposts of
 the empire only to die at Netley.There
 are also some German crosses from the 
 first world war.
