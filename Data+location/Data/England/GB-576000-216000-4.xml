		<title>04The Major Whitbread Charity</title>
		<content>    Thomas Whitbread, of the family    
 who were the Lords of the manor and   
 who owned Fambridge Hall and White    
 Notley Hall left some land when he    
 died in 1686. The actual field and the
 cottage are just outside our area but 
 was to provide money for 'the         
 ancientest poor of the parish of White
 Notley.                               
    Originally the money was used to   
 provide bread for any poor people who 
 came to church on Sunday and listened 
 to the sermon. The bread was left in  
 the church porch.                     
    The Trust now has more money to    
 give away each year. It is not used to
 provide bread any more but to provide 
 a gift of money to widows and widowers
 following the death of their spouse.  
 In 1983 all pensioners in the village 
 were given a Â£5 food voucher to spend 
 in the village shop.                  </content>
