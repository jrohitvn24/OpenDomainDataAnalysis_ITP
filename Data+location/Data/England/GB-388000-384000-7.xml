		<content> When I get home from school I get     
 changed and normally watch television.
 Sometimes I have a few games of       
 badminton with my mum, or go into the 
 front garden when the car is not      
 there, and with a tennis racket I hit 
 a tennis ball against our garage      
 doors.  After dinner I read a book or 
 ride my bike round the block a few    
 times. Other times I would play board 
 games or just mess about in the back  
 garden. Most of the time whilst I am  
 at home I have arguments with my      
 brother James.  We start dinner at 6  
 pm and finish at 6.35 pm. After dinner
 I normally have another two hours in  
 the summer, and I use them playing a  
 silly fun game of football with my    
 brother. In winter after dinner I     
 usually go up to my bedroom and read a
 book until it is time for bed.
