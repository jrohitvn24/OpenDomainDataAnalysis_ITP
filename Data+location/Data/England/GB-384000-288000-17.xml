		<content>My mom works at Westfield Middle School
as a cleaner.She scrubs the windows    
which have fingermarks on but sometimes
she is in Mr.Smith's room.On the wall  
there are birds and there is an        
eagle's wing. She goes to fetch the    
mop and bucket from the cupboard. Then 
she does his room over.There used to   
be a guinea pig but he died.Then my    
mom goes to the cloakroom to clean the 
dust off the window-sill.Then she goes 
to get the broom,sweeps the cloakroom, 
puts everything back in the cupboard   
and comes home.
