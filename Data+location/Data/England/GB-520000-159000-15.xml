		<title>15EPSOM GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content>{The Epsom Downs Golf Club was founded 
{in 1889 by the Earl of Rosebery.      
 Before this we are not sure what the  
 site was used for, but where the 10th 
 hole is now, some rifle butts were    
 found and we know that a cricket match
 was played on the Downs in 1880       
 between the gentlemen of Surrey  and  
 Sussex for 150 guineas.{A large part  
{of the course was also, at one time,  
{the Upper Cricket Ground of Epsom     
{College.                              
 Today the club has about 750 members  
 and the only foreseen changes are a   
 front and rear extension to the club  
 house.                                
{The golf course is owned by United    
{Race Courses, the owners of Epsom Race
{Course.}The golf club has a few       
 keepers who maintain the golf course  
 but most of it is done by the Downs'  
 keepers.                              </content>
