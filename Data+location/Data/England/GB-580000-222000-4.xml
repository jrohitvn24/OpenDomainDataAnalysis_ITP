		<content>{*}Stisted is a relatively small       
 village with less than 1000           
 inhabitants.There is a primary school 
 with about 60 children,a small parish 
 church,a village hall,a pub and a     
 shop and sub-post office.Braintree    
 Golf Course is just outside the       
 village.It is used by lots of the     
 local people as well as people from   
 the surrounding district.             
{*}There is a youth club,and clubs for 
 the over-sixties,keep-fit,whist and   
 bowls.There is also a Mothers' Union. 
{*}The main activity is farming;there  
 are 3 or 4 farmhouses in the parish.  
 Most people travel to                 
 Braintree,Chelmsford,Witham or        
 Colchester to work.Transport out of   
 the village is difficult.School buses 
 come here every day,but shoppers may  
 go to Braintree at only one time on a 
 Wednesday or a Saturday.              </content>
