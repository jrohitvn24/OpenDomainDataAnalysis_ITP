		<content>  The types and varieties of           
 recreational activities reflect the   
 rural nature of the area. Many of the 
 hobbies are pursued individually and  
 do not require much travel but make   
 use of the countryside in which we    
 live. The most popular are gardening, 
 handicrafts, reading, music, horse    
 riding, walking, nature study,        
 shooting,tennis, cricket, photography,
 fishing, dancing, cooking and cycling.
 There are several leisure centres with
 reasonable access by public transport 
 providing a wide variety of physical  
 activities. Theatres and cinema are   
 also within fairly easy reach. The    
 village pubs provide more leisurely   
 activities: darts, dominoes, cribbage,
 bar billiards, shove ha'penny and Aunt
 Sally which has teams in the district 
 league.
