		<title>09Shopping in Epworth.</title>
		<content>    Epworth is lucky to have a variety 
 of shops ranging from supermarkets to 
 those selling clothes and horse riding
 equipment. This is a surprising range 
 considering the population is only    
 around 3,000 people.                  
    The new Woods' and the planned Leos
 supermarket do present some smaller   
 shopkeepers with big problems. Some   
 may be forced to close because of the 
 competitive prices.                   
    Epworth does lack a good shoe shop.
 There was one but the shop sells      
 fabrics now. A delicatessen in the    
 village also closed recently as the   
 service seemed to be too specialized  
 for a small community.                
    The overall picture is not one of  
 problems and closures. The centre     
 continues to thrive as it caters for  
 shoppers from surrounding villages who
 haven't such a good choice of shops.  </content>
