		<content>{Cheltenham and Stratford Railway Ltd. 
 is a company run by steam railway     
 enthusiasts. Their long term project  
 is to re-open sections of the former  
 Great Western Railway main line       
 between Cheltenham and Stratford which
 was closed in 1968.The Society arrived
 at the site of{Toddington Station     
 in 1981. All the track had been       
 removed and the station was derelict. 
 Since then the Society have laid 1.5  
 miles of track. The station is in the 
 process of restoration together with  
 numerous steam and diesel locomotives.
 The station is open to the public on  
 Sundays and Bank Holidays between     
 Easter and September. They operate    
 standard and narrow gauge rides. They 
 have about 1000 visitors a month. They
 hope to extend their operations in the
 future, firstly to{Winchcombe}and     
 ultimately to{Cheltenham}.            </content>
