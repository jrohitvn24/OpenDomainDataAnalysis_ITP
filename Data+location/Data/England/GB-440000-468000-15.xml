		<title>15FISHING - THE SOCIAL MATCH</title>
		<content>    The Helperby Fishing Club is a     
 common thing in the village because it
 is held every year.   I am in the club
 and I enter a few matches.   Last     
 Saturday I was in a match and I came  
 second.   The match is called the     
 Social Match and after it there is    
 asort of prize giving.   They have a  
 dinner and then present the cups.     
 Last year I won the Junior cup.   The 
 dinner consists of a meat salad and   
 for seconds there is a choice between 
 chocolate cake or raspberry pie.      
 Then comes cheese and biscuits.   Next
 the cups are presented.               
    There are two clubs that fish the  
 Social Match ours and The West Riding 
 Anglers.   Helperby have won the match
 over the last two years.
