		<content> Ilsham Primary School was built in    
 1871 because there weren't enough     
 schools to hold the children attending
 school after the 1871 Education Act.It
 was built as a village church         
 school.Parents had to pay a few pence 
 a week for their children's schooling 
 until 1903.The school was built as a  
 single room for three classes         
 separated by curtains.One new         
 classroom was built in 1913 and       
 another in 1970.Miss Janet Shepherd   
 started as a pupil in 1898 and then   
 went to college to train as a         
 teacher.She started teaching at Ilsham
 School in 1921,then became            
 Headmistress in 1929 until she retired
 in 1958.She was still alive at the    
 school's Centenary in 1971.In 1939    
 some evacuees came from London and the
 school was very overcrowded.Now there 
 are 125 children in four classes.     </content>
