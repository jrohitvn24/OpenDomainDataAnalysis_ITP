		<title>14SOME HISTORY OF WOORE</title>
		<content> One explanation of the name of the    
 village is that it came from the      
 Anglo-Saxon word{"Oure"}meaning a     
 boundary.                             
 The village is in the{Domesday Book,  
 where it is shown as held by Wiiliam  
 Pantolf.                              
 In medieval times the most notable    
 family of Woore was the{de Bulkeleys. 
 The village was on the{stage-coach    
 route to Holyhead, and the Swan hotel 
 had stables where the church is now.  
 The village{workhouse}was at Irelands 
 Cross, and it is now a house.         
 When the{railway}was opened from Stoke
 to Market Drayton, people used to have
 a ride out to Pipe Gate and Woore for 
 a day out of the smoke.               
 There is an{ash tree,}which stands at 
 the highest point, and tradition says 
 that it may be seen for many miles,   
 and that it has always been replaced. </content>
