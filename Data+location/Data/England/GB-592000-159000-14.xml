		<content> Normally the hops would run along the 
 ground so special women train the hops
 up the string. The hop gardens near us
 are called Blacklands, Selby, &amp; Upper 
 &amp; Lower Tickham. Around the edges of  
 the hop gardens are poplar trees.     
 Small flowers that have a beautiful   
 smell grow, &amp; birds nest &amp; have babies
 there. If you look there are hundreds 
 of different grasses and the stinging 
 nettles are cut to fertilise the      
 ground, &amp; sometimes the flowers.      
 People are strictly forbidden to walk 
 through the hop gardens as they could 
 kill the hops by spreading diseases.  
 The Romans were the first people to   
 bring hops to Britain. Kent has grown 
 hops for hundreds of years. Hops are  
 used to flavour beer.
