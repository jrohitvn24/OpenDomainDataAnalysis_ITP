		<content> The village of Pavenham has very      
 successfully resisted pressures of    
 development to which other similar and
 nearby places have succumbed. Most of 
 the village has been designated a     
 Conservation Area.                    
                                       
 The church stands slightly to the     
 north of the older part of the village
 on higher ground. It has a 14th       
 century spire and some 14th and 15th  
 century work in the main body of the  
 building. The original building was   
 begun in the 13th century but not much
 of this remains.                      
                                       
 Agriculture was for many years the    
 main occupation with straw plaiting   
 and rush gathering later additions.   
 Today, as with many other village in  
 the area, most people travel to nearby
 towns to work.                        </content>
