		<title>16OLD AGE PENSIONERS IN HALE.</title>
		<content>                                       
    A group of our{older residents}of  
 Hale were interviewed whilst watching 
 the bowling in Hale village. Their    
 views are quite interesting. They find
 Hale to be a quiet village still with 
 an adequate supply of{shops}such as   
 clothes, chemists and grocers. They   
 felt that there were too many estate  
 agents and banks for the size of the  
 village and that items were generally 
 dearer than in Altrincham.{Traffic    
 congestion and lack of car parking was
 a nuisance and the new hotel and car  
 parking was described as a            
 monstrosity. The O.A.P. club next to  
 the bowling green is a favourite place
 to drink tea and chat about old times.
 Considering the increase in vandalism 
 and crime the pensioners were         
 concerned that the nearest{police     
 station was in Altrincham!!.          </content>
