		<title>04FORESTRY COMMISSION.</title>
		<content> The Bellingham offices of the forestry
 commission control 50 700 hectares of 
 forestry land and are responsible for 
 the care and maintenance of 3 forestry
 villages.450 hectares of trees are    
 planted every year,and 30 to 40 contr_
 actors are employed to pull trees up. 
 10 to 15 office workers are also empl_
 oyed.The local people are for the     
 forestry commission because it brings 
 many jobs to the area.They hope to    
 have doubled their workforce by the   
 end of the century because they are   
 doubling the amount of trees planted. 
 In their workshop 1 mile from the vil_
 lage they maintain all their vehicles 
 and machinery.They believe the fores- 
 try commission brings rural employment
 as well as wildlife facilites,and it  
 contributes to the landscape for which
 this area is so well known.
