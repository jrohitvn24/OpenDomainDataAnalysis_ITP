		<title>02FARMING LIFE IN BIBURY</title>
		<content> Winter wheat is the main crop grown in
 this area with a small percentage of  
 winter and spring barley, and a few   
 crops of oilseed rape and peas. Live  
 stock is mostly beef and sheep. In    
 years gone by Bibury had two main land
 owners and the river divided them, the
 one side being, and still is, known as
 Arlington. This land was let to       
 "tenant" farmers. These are now dying 
 out and the land is gradually being   
 sold off to land owners. There are    
 very few farm workers employed on a   
 farm, compared to fifty years ago.    
 Agriculteral contractors are being    
 used a lot on the farm due to the high
 cost of farm machinery. The average   
 price of farm machinery today is:-    
    TRACTOR: Â£12,000                   
    COMBINE HARVESTER: Â£45,000         
    PLOUGH: Â£1,000                     
    DRILL: Â£3,000                      </content>
