		<title>01TILBURY</title>
		<content>   {Tilbury,}as a town, began only in  
 the 1880's.There have been farmers and
 scattered cottages here for 100s of   
 years,especially around the ferry     
 which is at a natural crossing point  
 for the Thames.The fort dates from the
 late 15th century as a deterrent to   
 foreign invaders.                     
   However, the{northern}end of Tilbury
 included in this survey,was all built 
 this century.There is a substantial   
 number of{council houses}which won a  
 design award in the 1920s but look    
 decidedly the worse for wear now.Next 
 to the{Football Stadium}are a number  
 of modern 1970 houses; and also nearby
 is a permanent site called{"The       
{Fairground"}where fairground families 
 park their trailers during the winter 
 months.There are also a Junior and an 
 Infant school and a large Nursery     
 school.                               </content>
