		<content>      {A Wednesday in my Life          
{  }I wake up at 6:30,I go downstairs  
 and make cereal and a cup of tea.Then 
 I watch television until 7:30.I dress 
 and wash.I clean my teeth with an     
 electric toothbrush.At 8:30 I go to   
 school and knock for Robert and other 
 boys.At school we have assembly then  
 maths then play.At play we play       
 football.Next is English then dinner. 
 After dinner its play then games.Then 
 play again after that its general     
 work.Then Robert and I walk home.     
 I have dinner then watch television   
 then go to bed.                       
  Nearly every home has a television   
 and some have videos,telephones ,     
 computers and other electrical applia-
 nces.Many houses have gardens.Most    
 people keep their homes and gardens   
 neatly.                               
                                       </content>
