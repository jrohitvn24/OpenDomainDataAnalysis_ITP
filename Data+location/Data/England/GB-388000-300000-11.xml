		<content> There are seven Christian churches in 
this area but no Mosques or Temples.   
 The {Church of England} is represented
by St. Michael of All Angels and Christ
the King in Tettenhall and the Epiphany
in Oxley. Their ministers are the Revs.
Makepeace, Fyfe and Preece. Their      
congregations number about 500.        
 The {Nonconformist}churches are the   
Fordhouses Baptists and the Rakegate   
Methodists whose ministers are the Revs
Smith and Field and have congregations 
of 150 and 25 respectively.            
 The Holy Trinity{Catholic}church is   
especially for the Wolverhampton Polish
community. Their priest is Fr. Matysik 
and it serves a congregation of 450.   
 There is also an Italian Evangelical  
church serving a small congregation.   
 All the churches except one have been 
built in the last 30 years due to the  
movement of population.                </content>
