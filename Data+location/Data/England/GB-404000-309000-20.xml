		<title>20GERALD HOWARTH M.P.2.</title>
		<content>An interview with Gerald Howarth       
continued from page 19.                
  After sorting out the post he takes  
part in a meeting where a committee    
examine pieces of legislation.This     
committee goes on from 10.30a.m to     
12.00 midday.At 2.30p.m. Parliament    
meets.The debate can go on there until 
10.30p.m.                              
  At the weekends Gerald Howarth has   
meetings.On Saturdays,twice a month he 
holds a surgery where people come and  
explain their problems.                
  Gerald Howarth does not think that   
the people of Burntwood have many      
problems apart from unemployment and   
the problems caused in providing new   
facilities if the area expands.        
  He considers that the problems in    
Burntwood are different from a large   
town.                                  
                                       </content>
