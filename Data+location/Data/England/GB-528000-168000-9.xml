		<title>09Mitcham Common Factories 1</title>
		<content> Before anything was built there, there
 was just common land. In 1782 the     
 workhouse was built to house the poor 
 and tramps. The path across the Common
 from the Blue House bridge is known as
 the Workhouse path.  It was used as a 
 Workhouse until 1838. The red brick   
 building had a clock. When the local  
 Workhouse was no longer required the  
 local authorities wanted the building 
 destroyed and the land returned to    
 normal common land.  The Lord of the  
 Manor raised an objection.He said that
 the land and building was his and he  
 wanted it to be a factory.  When the  
 Workhouse was not being used it was   
 sold and used as a Lucifer match      
 factory. It was one of the first in   
 the country. Later the building was   
 taken over by a rubber factory, where 
 they made water proof clothing for the
 soldiers for the Crimea War.          </content>
