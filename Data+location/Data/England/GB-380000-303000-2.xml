		<content> On Sunday 28th April a cycle race was 
 held in Albrighton.For further details
 refer to Notable Events.To celebrate  
 40 years of peace we had a big V.E Day
 Parade.In this parade all the         
 Brownies, Guides,Cubs and Scouts took 
 part.It was a great success.          
     Just lately the Albrighton County 
 Junior School and the Amateur Dramatic
 Society have launched a Stage Lighting
 Appeal Fund among other fund raising  
 events we published a famous people's 
 cookery book.In this we wrote off to  
 famous personalities asking them for  
 their favourite recipes.We compiled   
 these in a book which costs Â£1.50.The 
 Operatic Society will perform "Sweet  
 Hearts"to assist the appeal.The target
 is Â£4000 in all.
