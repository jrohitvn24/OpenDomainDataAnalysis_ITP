		<title>05 The Village of St Minver</title>
		<content> The oldest part of the village        
 stretches from{St Minver House        
 northwards to the crossroads. All the 
 houses were once owned by the         
 squire, but were sold in 1965 when the
 estate was sold. The main settlement  
 now consists of 17{privately_owned    
 properties and 8 council houses. Five 
 of the homes are occupied by retired  
 people. The winter population of the  
 village is{58,}17 of whom are         
 children. The local{blacksmith's forge
 has been converted into a garage. The 
 only shop is the{Post Office}which    
 also sells sweets, batteries and      
 cards. The pub and the{Cricket Club   
 are the main social centres in the    
 evenings. The{Perceval Institute}is   
 the parish hall where the{Over Sixties
{Club}and other functions are held.    
 Very few people who live in St Minver 
 work in the village.                  </content>
