		<title>12SEWSTERN VILLAGE II</title>
		<content> The summer months see one of the local
 farmers having to employ casual labour
 to hand pick potatoes.  This unusual  
 feature in this mechanised age is     
 caused by the land being to stoney.   
 The village has seen a decline in the 
 local shop, local postman, Chapel     
 closing, no bus service too Melton.   
 The latter affects the 11 - 17 year   
 olds. Their schooling takes place in  
 Melton so they are unable to go to    
 visit their friends etc.              
 Even in the 1960's it was felt for a  
 time that the village was in decline  
 with no young people settling down    
 owing to lack of employment and       
 properties, but in late 1970's and    
 early 1980's we saw them return       
 because saleable properties became    
 available and the ownership of a car  
 to commute.  So a thriving lyoung     
 community is springing up.            </content>
