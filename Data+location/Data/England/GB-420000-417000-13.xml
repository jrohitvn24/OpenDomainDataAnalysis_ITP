 Most farms in this area graze cows and
 sheep. There are dairy cows and beef  
 cattle. Many farms cut the grass to   
 make silage, which is used as fodder  
 during the winter months. Newhall Farm
 does grow potatoes, wheat and barley, 
 but not in large amounts. Church Farm,
 Whitley is a dairy farm with 50 cows. 
 They are all of the old dairy longhorn
 breed. Milking takes place at 6.30 am 
 and 5.00 pm in an automatic           
 herringbone milking parlour, which    
 milks 10 cows at a time; the whole    
 process for 50 cows takes 1 hr. The   
 milk is kept in a refrigerated tank   
 until collected. The farm has 2 Jacobs
 sheep providing wool for the family   
 which is spun and knitted by the      
 farmer's wife.                        
 The farm has 100 acres of grassland.
