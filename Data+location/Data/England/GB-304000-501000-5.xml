 We stood on the school steps. The     
 grass nearby had a muddy appearance   
 because of children running over it   
 when the grass was wet.Some men were  
 in the boiler room with their radio on
 full blast.A bit of the paintwork had 
 fallen off the wall of the school.You 
 could see Windscale Atomic works. The 
 steam was tumbling out of the         
 chimneys.It was very quiet.The pond   
 was colourful with flowers.Odd sea    
 gulls flew over.In the distance there 
 were lambs and sheep.From this        
 distance they looked like bits of     
 white material.
