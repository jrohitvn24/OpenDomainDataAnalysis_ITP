		<title>06THE VILLAGE OF PRESTON.</title>
		<content> The oldest person in Preston is Mrs   
 Townsend who is 89. Preston church has
 a tower and not a spire. It is 75 feet
 high, and the Vicar, the Rev. Peter   
 Sudbury, took us to the top of the    
 tower to show us the magnificent view 
 over the surrounding countryside. He  
 told us that there are 466 adults     
 living in the parish of Preston. The  
 Parish is joined to Siddington as far 
 as Southmead and Cherry Tree Drive.   
 Many of the buildings in the village  
 are changing in the way they are used.
 The old blacksmith's shop is now a    
 house. Mildred's farm is being        
 converted into homes for the elderly, 
 and the old school building is now the
 village hall. The trout farm used to  
 be the old mill.
