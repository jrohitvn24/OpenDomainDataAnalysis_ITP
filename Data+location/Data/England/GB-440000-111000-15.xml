		<title>15  Gateway to Southampton</title>
		<content>   Southampton has been one of the     
 major gateways to southern Britain.   
 Most people connect Southampton with  
 ships, but the city has much more to  
 offer.                                
   The oldest building in the city is  
 St.Michael's Church, known as the     
 'Archangel'. Built by Norman French   
 settlers and rebuilt in the 15th      
 century, it has a black Tornai marble 
 font, one of the three in Britain. The
 Tudor House in St. Michael's Square is
 a fine example of Southampton in the  
 Elizabethan years.                    
   The Maritime Museum, Woolhouse, in  
 Bugle Street, is a fine example of a  
 Medieval warehouse; it was used to    
 house French prisoners of war in the  
 18th and 19th centuries.
