		<content>    In Porthleven there is a cricket   
 pitch, a football field, two tennis   
  ourts, a putting green and three     
 parks.                                
    In the parks there are swings,     
 slides, roundabouts and goal posts.   
 The tennis courts open only in summer 
 and you can hire tennis racquets if   
 you need to.                          
    The putting green which used to be 
 beside the tennis courts was closed   
 last summer but they are opening a new
 one some time in the future.          
    The cricket pitch used to be an old
 field. There is quite a big building  
 where the players go to eat or when it
 rains. You can go and play whenever   
 you like. Some people say that the    
 football field was an old athletics   
 ground until they covered it over with
 turf. They have a match every Saturday
 and Sunday.                           </content>
