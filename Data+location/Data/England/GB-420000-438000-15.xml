		<title>15Employment in  Rawdon</title>
		<content>  We studied 7 companies we thought    
 representative of the area,employing  
 about 1000 people altogether,approx.  
 25% of whom were{skilled craftsmen}eg 
 electricians,printers;over 70% were { 
{semi-skilled}(trained for a specific  
 job in the factory) and only a few    
 unskilled doing jobs like cleaning.   
  A questionaire we sent out showed    
 very little unemployment in Rawdon,   
 with over three times as many people  
 describing their jobs as providing a  
 service rather than helping to produce
 goods.In a majority of families both  
 father and mother work outside the    
 home,both travelling to work by car.{A
{typical mother}might work part-time   
 near home,for the local authority as a
 teacher,nurse or office worker.A{     
{typical father}would work full-time,  
 further afield,for a private employer 
 in an office,or be self-employed.     </content>
