		<title>15Kelsey Park, Beckenham</title>
		<content> Kelsey Park is a pleasant suburban    
 park to the south of Beckenham High   
 Street. It has several unusual        
 attractions including an aviary with  
 exotic birds and a large lake with    
 several species of duck including     
 Mallard and Muscovy. A large part of  
 the park is prohibited to dogs so that
 the wild birds are not disturbed. In  
 this area there also a large number of
 grey squirrels which are very tame.   
 Facilities in the park include a play 
 ground for younger children, and      
 tennis courts and a bowling green. The
 park is well maintained and is much   
 used by local people. A number of     
 expensive houses back onto the park   
 enjoying the trees and plants  and the
 lake with the  River Beck running     
 through it.
