		<title>03WHY I LIKE THWAITES SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Our school is called Thwaites Primary 
 School. It has three teachers and in  
 the whole school there are 50         
 children from 4 to 11 years old. I am 
 a top infant and in our class there   
 are 16.I like doing Sound Sense at    
 school because of the word games and I
 like writing stories because I can put
 magic things in them.I'm not very good
 at poems yet because I haven't had as 
 much practise.                        
 I think our school is a nice school   
 because there aren't so many rules and
 because it's in the country.The       
 children here don't do much fighting! 
 At playtime I like going to play on   
 the climbing frame and in the trees.  
 My best tree is "The Nest".It is a    
 tree in the churchyard and it has a   
 nest shape at the top. I enjoy finding
 new ways up the tree.
