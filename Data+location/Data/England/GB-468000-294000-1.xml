		<title>01LANDSCAPE FARMING HABITATION</title>
		<content>   This area is predominately open,    
 undulating, good quality farmland.    
 Fields are put to either pasture or   
 cereal growing, the majority being    
 cereals. Sheep and cattle are raised, 
 some milk is produced but lately      
 rearing for meat alone has become an  
 increasing trend. Twelve working farms
 are located in the area but three work
 approximately half of all the         
 farmland. The countryside is well     
 wooded along the hedgerows, the       
 principal tree being ash.Some hedgerow
 removal has taken place but this      
 practice has not yet become extensive 
 and the overall field pattern has     
 largely been maintained. Housing is   
 sparse in the countryside, the        
 principal centres of habitation being 
 the villages of Kibworth Harcourt, Tur
 Langton and to a smaller extent       
 Shangton.                             </content>
