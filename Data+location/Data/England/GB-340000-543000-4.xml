		<content> There are 11 farms in the area. Some  
 are quite small, less than 100 acres; 
 others are larger, between 100 and 200
 acres.                                
 The main crop is grass, used directly 
 as pasture or made into silage or     
 hay. The other sorts of crops are     
 oilseed rape, barley, turnips for     
 animal feed, and potatoes.            
 The animals kept are mainly sheep and 
 cattle, the sheep for wool and meat,  
 cattle for milk and meat.             
 The farms are mechanised, with an     
 average of about 2 workers, and some  
 contractors help at busier times.     
 In Ivegill there is a Herb Farm, whose
 produce is processed and sold locally.
