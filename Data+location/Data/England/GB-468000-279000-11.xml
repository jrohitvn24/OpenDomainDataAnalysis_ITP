		<content>  The school in the village of Clipston
is a very important part of the        
community, and has been so for three   
hundred years.  It has however, been   
completely modernised with a hall and  
library extension built on the back of 
the original building.  When it was    
first built in 1667 it was used as a   
Hospital and School combined, but in   
this century has only been used for    
education.  There are five classes at  
the moment, and the number of children 
on role is 120 approximately. As well  
as the five teaching staff, there is a 
music specialist who visits the school 
each week to give the children singing 
and recorder lessons.                  
  The school buildings are also used in
the evenings for other activities, such
as Brownies, Guides, Evening Classes   
and general meetings.
