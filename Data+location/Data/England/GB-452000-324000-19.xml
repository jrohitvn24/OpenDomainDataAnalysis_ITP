		<title>19EAST LEAKE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> The area is proud of the fact that it 
 has its own brand new fire station.It 
 was opened in 1984 and is situated    
 near the centre of the village next to
 the library and Health Centre.        
 It is a small station but still able  
 to cope with most emergencies which   
 take place.                           
 All the fireman are part-time,the     
 Senior Officer running the local Post 
 Office.                               
 The men are issued with 'bleepers' and
 when called have to hurry to the      
 station as not all are required on    
 separate calls.They are then employed 
 on a 'first come first served'basis.  
 If the emergency is of a particular   
 serious nature then help is received  
 from a larger station at West         
 Bridgford some ten miles away.
