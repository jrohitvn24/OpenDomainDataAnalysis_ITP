		<content>  The Miner's Welfare provided travel  
 tickets for those who needed them.    
                                       
  Pocket money became scarce and was   
 often non-existant.                   
                                       
  Thirteen long months had passed.The  
 NUM reached a decision.The men would  
 go back to work.                      
                                       
  I shall never forget the day when the
 miners,including my Dad,marched back  
 to work.Brass bands were playing---   
 everybody seemed happy--the marchers  
 walked with their heads held high.    
 A carnival atmosphere prevailed.      
                                       
  This dispute will live for long in   
 our memories. It is my fervent hope   
 that the bitter lessons learned will  
 be as long-lasting!
