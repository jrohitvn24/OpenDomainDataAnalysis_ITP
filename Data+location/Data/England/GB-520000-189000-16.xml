		<title>16SENTINEL SQ.-SHOPPING AREA.</title>
		<content>   Sentinel Square is a shopping       
 precinct in Brent Street and was      
 completed in 1971.  It is typical of  
 High Street development all over the  
 country. In this case the Classic     
 Cinema, a pub called the Rose and     
 Crown, a factory, and flats were      
 demolished to provide the land to     
 build the complex of shops and flats. 
   Sentinel Square comtains a large    
 Tesco supermarket, a Midland Bank, an 
 Electricity showroom, and 14 shops.   
   Although Sentinel Square is not     
 covered there is plenty of cover at   
 the entrance at Brent Street which was
 originally a small road called Bell   
 View Road.                            
   The interior of the square is paved 
 and attractively landscaped with      
 shrubs and plants.                    
   As an infill exercise it sits very  
 unhappily in Brent Street.            </content>
