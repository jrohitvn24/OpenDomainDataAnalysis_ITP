		<title>09INDUSTRY, KIRKBY UNDERWOOD</title>
		<content> The only large industrial concern in  
 the area is that of Nelson Green &amp; Son
 agricultural and heavy plant machine  
 engineers based in Kirkby Underwood.  
   Mr.Green came to the village in 1936
 to start his agricultural parts and   
 repair business. At one time the local
 council tried to close the concern but
 three members of the Parish Council   
 made a personal visit to the Minister 
 of Transport and the business was     
 allowed to continue. Now only seven   
 full-time workers are employed but    
 other firms rely on the business  -   
 tyre, blacksmith, sales, etc. The firm
 is very much an international concern.
   One byproduct is the aquisition of  
 vintage vehicles, including military. 
 Many are kept at the old aerodrome a  
 little to the north. 56 vintage agric-
 ultural vehicles are kept in the      
 village and may be seen by the public.</content>
