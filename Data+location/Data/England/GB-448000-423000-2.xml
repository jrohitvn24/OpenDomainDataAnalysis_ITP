		<content>                                       
 On the field of Knottingley Vale      
 school there is a large variety of    
 birds.The Magpie is often seen on our 
 school field,it comes to collect shiny
 objects.The Crows and Pigeons are very
 common but the Seagulls are seen more 
 often.We see Blue_Tits and Great-Tits 
 hopping along our field collecting    
 little scraps of food,we also see     
 House_Martins who build their nests in
 the houses around our school.There are
 lots of Swifts and Swallows and       
 Chaffinches.The Robin is a shy bird   
 because you only see it occasionally. 
 The Starling and Thrush are common too
 along with the Blackbird.The Collared 
 Doves, Sparrows and Pied Wagtails also
 frequent the premises.
