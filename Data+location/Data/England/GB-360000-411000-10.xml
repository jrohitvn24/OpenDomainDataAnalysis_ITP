		<title>10THE COMMUNITY OF HORWICH (1)</title>
		<content>    Horwich could easily have become   
 two separate communities after        
 1884. Instead the Locomotive Works    
 brought many features of a thriving   
 community life, clubs, facilities and 
 even a fire station. Additional       
 housing filled in the gap between the 
 two roads of Horwich.                 
    However in the last forty years    
 growth slackened, housing in the      
 centre of Horwich deteriorated and    
 yet new housing, some of it far too   
 large for the average size of a modern
 nuclear family, was allowed to sprawl 
 up the hillside towards Rivington     
 Pike. Ugly "bombsites" started to     
 appear in the town centre to the East 
 of the "Crown", the landmark at the   
 junction of the two main roads.       
    Horwich would seem to have lost    
 status when it was absorbed into      
 Bolton Metropolitan Borough in 1976.  </content>
