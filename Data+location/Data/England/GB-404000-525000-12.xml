		<title>12HOME LIFE IN WOODLAND P.M.</title>
		<content> After{dinner}Rebecca and I went for a 
 bike ride to Romaldkirk which is 7    
 miles away and it was hard because    
 there were lots of big hills.         
   We had our{tea}at Rebecca's Nana's. 
 We had sandwiches,cakes,biscuits and  
 drinks.After our tea we{set off home  
 again.It was even harder going back   
 because it was nearly all uphill.It   
 was about 7.00p.m.when we got home.   
  I went to{bed}at about 9.30p.m. and  
 watched 'Thats Life' on T.V.My bedroom
 has pink and white wallpaper,         
 bedspread,curtains and lampshade and a
 pink carpet.                          
  Before I closed the curtains I looked
 out of my bedroom window and looked at
 the view.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
