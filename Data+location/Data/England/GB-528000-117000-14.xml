		<content>   In 1898 the Victoria pleasure       
 gardens were opened in Burgess Hill.  
 These were on the Western side of the 
 town and after draining and clearing  
 provided the site for the new {       
{industrial estate.                    
   At the last count there were 58     
{factories,}employing over a thousand  
 people. Many of these travel in from  
 nearby towns and villages.            
   They{manufacture}a variety of       
 products - perfume, clothes, computer 
 components, specialised parts for     
 custom-built vehicles and costume     
 jewellery.                            
   There are also a number of large {  
{offices and warehouses,}some of which 
 are situated towards the centre of the
 town.                                 
   New factories and offices continue  
 to be built in and around Burgess     
 Hill,encroaching into the countryside.</content>
