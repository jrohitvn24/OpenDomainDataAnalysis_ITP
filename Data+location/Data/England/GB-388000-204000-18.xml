		<content>  A famous citizen of Eastcombe, Thomas
 Davies was schoolmaster in the Church 
 of England school, having begun life  
 as a farm labourer's son, and who     
 later became M.P. in Cirencester.   A 
 private survey was conducted in the   
 village in 1979.  It showed that 62   
 people in the village were either     
 retired or unemployed. Most of the    
 factories in the valleys employ fewer 
 people and have changed to engineering
 or light industry from their earlier  
 use as cloth mills. At one time there 
 were a large number of children living
 in the village as it was used to      
 foster Dr. Barnado's children and     
 there was an orphanage run by nuns.   
 Today the primary school has between  
 fifty and sixty pupils in three       
 classes. There are some families still
 living in the village who can trace   
 their ancestors for three generations.</content>
