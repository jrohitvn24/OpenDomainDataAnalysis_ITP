		<title>10A Favourite Game.</title>
		<content> My{favourite game}is{Bull Dogs.}We    
 always play on the grass so that we do
 not get hurt too much.We run round the
 front of our school and the last one  
 round is "on".He picks a boy or a girl
 and says the name.That person has to  
 try to run past the one who's on and  
 reach the trees without getting       
 caught.If you do not get past the     
 person and he manages to get your     
 shoulder down for the count of ten    
 then you join the catching side.If he 
 does not get you down you run past him
 and get to the trees then it is       
 "BULLDOGS AWAY".                      
 Everybody tries to go past the        
 trees.If the{catcher}catches any one, 
 then they're on.The game finishes when
 there is only one person to be caught 
 and the rest are all{chasers.
