		<content> My father gets up at about 6a.m. to   
 milk the cows.This is finished by     
 8.30a.m. and then he has breakfast and
 takes us to school.The milking        
 equipment has to be cleaned and the   
 cows put out into the field.At 11a.m. 
 he has a ten minute break and then at 
 this time of the year he starts       
 haymaking.This will take up most of   
 the afternoon until the cows have to  
 be brought in at 4p.m.When this is    
 finished and the equipment cleaned    
 again ready for the morning.Tea is    
 about 7p.m.and then out into the      
 fields again until 10p.m.He likes to  
 be in bed by 11p.m.If he is not too   
 busy after tea we go out on the horse 
 and cart.Our farm was built in the    
 17th century and there are 114 dairy  
 cows,2 saddle-back pigs and a welshcob
 horse.                                
                                       </content>
