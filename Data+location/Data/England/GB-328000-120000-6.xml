		<title>06FARMING NEAR HATCH BEAUCHAMP</title>
		<content>   On arable farms in the late summer, 
 farmers plough the fields. Then they  
 work them with a power harrow and sow 
 the seeds with a drill. After a few   
 days the field is fertilised with     
 chemical fertiliser and slug pellets  
 and later sprayed with weed killer.   
 When the corn has grown, in the       
 summer, it is harvested by a combine  
 harvester and stored. The stalks are  
 baled in round, square or oblong      
 bales, this is then stored as well.   
   Pature land is not usually ploughed.
 Sometimes the grass is cut and used   
 for silage or hay making and used to  
 feed cattle during the winter.        
 Occasionally the pasture is grazed    
 directly by cattle in the fields.
