     There is a small airfield to the  
SW which is used for light aircraft,   
and there is a school of flying        
instruction and a very small museum of 
aircraft.                              
                                       
     At the weekends there is a large  
open-air market at the edge of the     
airfield .The airfield is also the     
home of several small factories.       
                                       
     There is an annual fair taking up 
a whole day in the summer, and a       
number of fetes organised by the       
Anglican and Methodist Churches and by 
the large village school.
