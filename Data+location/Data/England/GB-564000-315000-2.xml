		<content> We spoke to two farmers, one in North 
 Runcton and one in Middleton. One     
 farms about 200 acres and the other   
 about 3000 acres(divided between three
 farms). Despite the differences in    
 size the pattern of farming is very   
 similar in each case.                 
{ Arable}farming is the main activity  
 and the chief crops are{wheat}and     
{barley}then sugar beet. Oil-seed rape,
 oats, and potatoes are also grown. We 
 asked what changes have taken place in
 the last l5 years and were told of the
 rapid growth in importance of{oil-seed
{rape}which is now a more profitable   
 crop than either wheat or barley.     
  Both farmers keep beef cattle which  
 they sell at{Kings Lynn}market.Only   
 one breeds his own cattle.The large   
 farm also has sheep and pigs.
