		<content>      Goring and Streatley Golf Club   
 has some excellent facilities: Â£250000
 was spent on building a new club house
 in 1982 with a marvellous catering    
 service. People may come just to enjoy
 the view or to dine at night. Even if 
 they are not members they can still   
 play, paying a "Green Fee" of Â£10 per 
 hour. The club holds 26 tournaments   
 annually including "The Men's Medal", 
 Mixed Open Events and National Amateur
 Events.                               
                                       
      There is a total turnover of     
 Â£300000 but it costs about Â£280000 to 
 run the club. Several public footpaths
 run across the golf course from which 
 you might see wild fowl, such as      
 pheasants, and maybe even deer in the 
 woods.
