		<content> The block is traversed by the A2 which
 follows the course of the Roman Road. 
 This road divides the block into two  
 distinct areas.To the south lies      
 mainly farmland served by the villages
 of Betsham and Southfleet.To the north
 east there is a residential zone which
 forms the south-west sector of        
 Gravesend.New housing development has 
 spread outwards towards the A2 and a  
 new industrial estate on the outskirts
 of the residential zone is hoped to   
 bring new jobs to the area.Within the 
 residential zone there are public and 
 other community services and local    
 shopping parades.The north-west sector
 of the block incorporates part of     
 Swanscombe and is dominated by old    
 chalk quarries and present day        
 workings,here the land is more open.  
 The community is mixed and includes   
 all age groups and the Indian minority</content>
