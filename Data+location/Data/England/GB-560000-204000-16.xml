		<title>16HIGHWOOD PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content> Highwood Parish Council is the first  
 tier of{local government}for part of  
 this survey area.Seven local people   
 meet every other month to talk about  
 problems.They have no real power but  
 give advice and think of themselves as
 the{local watchdog.}These are 2 issues
 concerning them at the moment.        
 The bins in the lay-bys on the A414   
 have paper liners.After busy weekends 
 or in wet weather they overfill and   
 split encouraging rats and looking un-
 sightly.The Borough Council say they  
 can't afford to empty them more than  
 once a week.The County Council won't  
 supply larger bins.The Parish Council 
 keep pressing for action.             
 The Parish Council are worried that   
 when{Stansted Airport}is developed,the
{Green Belt}restrictions on building   
 permission may be overruled.The Coun- 
 cil would fight this very forcefully. </content>
