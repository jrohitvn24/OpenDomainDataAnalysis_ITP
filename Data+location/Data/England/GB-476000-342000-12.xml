		<content> Communications depends largely on the 
 telephone in these rural communities  
 with the postal services to a much    
 lesser extent.A few farmers now have  
 C.B radios to communicate with the    
 workforce.A few households on the     
 southern edge of the area are in the  
 Peterborough telephone area with a    
 Loveden code which is based over the  
 border in Lincolnshire.The rest of the
 area is in the Nottingham system with 
 Whatton codes for Alverton,Flawborough
 and Thoroton whilst Shelton has a     
 Newark code.The area is served by 3   
 different postal sorting offices.The  
 only post office is in Shelton but all
 villages are served with a daily      
 delivery and two postal collections.  
 Local radio is a popular communication
 ,many residents using the 2 Nottingham
 stations for news,weather and travel  
 reports.                              </content>
