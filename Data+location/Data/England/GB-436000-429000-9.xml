		<title>09GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> Children play a variety of games on   
 the school playground and in the      
 street at home. Many games like       
 bull-dog ,bench tigs ,red-rover, hide 
 and seek and talyho are played at     
 school. We found that football is the 
 most popular playground game at our   
 school. Another popular one is        
 chain-tigs .                          
     How to play  chain-tigs           
 Someone is the catcher. He chases the 
 rest and when he catches one of them  
 he lucks  up with  them by holding    
 hands and together they chase the     
 others. Each time someone is caught   
 they join hands to make a long chain  
 until everyone is caught. The last to 
 be caught become the catcher .Many    
 different games are played in the     
 street at home like tennis, bad-egg,  
 rounders, street olympics, kick-can   
 and BMX tigs.                         </content>
