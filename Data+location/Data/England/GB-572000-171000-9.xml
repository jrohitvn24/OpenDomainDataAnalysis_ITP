		<title>09BOMB DISPOSAL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The Defence Explosive Ordnance School 
 is the only school in the British     
 Isles that trains men from all three  
 services in Bomb Disposal. It also    
 trains students from Nato countries   
 and sometimes from other foreign      
 countries. Last year the school had   
 students from 37 different nations.   
 The students are taught the theory    
 behind the working of explosive       
 devices, how to render them safe, and 
 how to identify some of the hundreds  
 of devices they are likely to         
 encounter in their work. They do a lot
 of practical work on real devices from
 which the explosives have been removed
 and replaced with a simulated         
 explosion if they get it wrong.Classes
 in the school never contain more than 
 fifteen students and generally are    
 much less.The school has a Diving Pool
 next to the River Medway for teaching </content>
