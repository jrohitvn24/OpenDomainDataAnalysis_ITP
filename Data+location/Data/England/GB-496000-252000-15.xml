		<title>15Health Care in Stevington</title>
		<content> Most people rely on the National      
 Health Service for their medical care 
 and are attached to group practices in
 Harrold or Bedford.Surgeries are held 
 morning and evening but as the bus    
 service is sparse,private transport is
 necessary for keeping appointments.   
 Doctors will make house calls on those
 too ill to travel.Patients needing    
 care at home will be visited by a     
 district nurse who will also look     
 after maternity cases before and after
 confinement.Stevington women usually  
 have their babies in Bedford Hospital.
 The ambulance service is available in 
 cases of emergency and also for taking
 patients receiving long-term treatment
 who cannot transport themselves.There 
 is a wide choice of dentists and      
 opticians in Bedford working privately
 and under the N.H.S.The mobile baby   
 and foot clinics visit monthly.       </content>
