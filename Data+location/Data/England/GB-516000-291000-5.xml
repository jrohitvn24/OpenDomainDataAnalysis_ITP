		<content> The Brickworks have always been a very
 important part  of {Yaxley}and their  
 chimneys dominate the skyline for     
 miles around.There are three          
 Brickworks in the village area.The    
 Orton,Beeby's and Norman Cross        
 Brickworks.Orton Brickworks are west  
 from the school, Beeby's Brickworks   
 are                                   
 north from the school and Norman Cross
 Brickworks are south-east from the    
 school.                               
  As the bricks are made from clay     
 being dug from a pit there are huge   
 areas which are either waste ground or
 very deep water.Some of these areas   
 are now being filled in with fly ash  
 and will be returned to agriculture.  
 One such area has been turned over to 
 a nature reserve,and is already a     
 haven for wildlife.
