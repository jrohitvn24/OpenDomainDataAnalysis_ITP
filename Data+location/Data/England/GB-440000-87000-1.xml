		<content>    The area is a rural one with       
 farmland, farmhouses, and two         
 villages.The low hills, small patches 
 of woodland, winding lanes and        
 footpaths make it scenically          
 attractive.                           
    The {Caul bourne}-the small stream 
 passing from South to North once had 5
 working mills within 3 kilometres.The 
 upper two-a fulling mill and a flour  
 mill were South of our area.          
    The paper mill at Nomans corner,   
 Newbridge has disappeared, Lower      
 Calbourne  Mill is still working,     
 Shalfleet Mill,situated where the Caul
 bourne joins the inlet of the Newtown 
 estuary is now a private house.       
    There are two villages {Newbridge} 
 and {Shalfleet.}Newbridge is a quiet  
 backwater.Shalfleet on the main       
 Newport Yarmouth road is more well    
 known.                                </content>
