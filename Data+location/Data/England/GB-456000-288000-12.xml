		<content> The landscape in the area is          
 undulating rising to a maximum height 
 of 5OOft above MSL.  The majority of  
 the area is made up of small fields   
 divided by hedgrows with small        
 deciduous copses scattered about.     
 These contain a mixture of traditional
 English native species except that the
 elm has almost disappeared due to     
 Dutch Elm disease.                    
 Small brooks and streams drain the    
 area and eventually flow into the     
 Soar, Trent and Severn river systems. 
 A significant portion of the area is  
 occupied by the disused airfield built
 during the l939/45 war and presently  
 used for warehousing and as a vehicle 
 testing track.                        
 Villages have grown up around farms   
 with a small number of l8th and l9th  
 century houses/cottages and a growing 
 number of modern properties.          </content>
