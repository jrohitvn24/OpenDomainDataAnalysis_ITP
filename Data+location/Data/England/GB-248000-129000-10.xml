 The Brownies is the name given to a   
 national group of young girls aged    
 between 7 and 10 years old. They meet 
 once a week under the leadership of   
 Brown Owl, Tawny Owl and Snowy Owl.   
 They earn badges by performing well at
 their chosen subject. The Brownies    
 organise themselves into Sixers. They 
 are the Elves, Gnomes, Pixies and     
 Imps. They stand in a circle and dance
 and sing around the Toadstool. They   
 have a really good time as well as    
 learning how to behave with respect   
 and kindness to others. Many of the   
 girls living in this area are         
 Brownies.
