 The name Dereham means "Deer          
 Enclosure" from Deorhamm, hamm meaning
 "an enclosed plot" and the town       
 probably got its name from an         
 enclosure made for the deer which were
 plentiful in the district in Saxon    
 times. Dereham is one of the oldest   
 towns in Norfolk with a history going 
 back 654 A.D. when Saint Withburga is 
 said to have founded a nunnery here.  
 The town's best known historic        
 monument is the site of her tomb in   
 the Parish Churchyard. When the monks 
 of Ely stole her body in 974, a spring
 said to have healing powers issued    
 from the tomb, which became a centre  
 of pilgrimage. Bonner's cottages,     
 built in 1502 once belonged to the    
 notorious Bishop Bonner, Rector of the
 Parish in the 16th Century.  They are 
 now a small museum.                   </content>
