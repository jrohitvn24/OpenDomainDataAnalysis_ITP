		<title>19Farming around Heybridge</title>
		<content>    The area has a history of farming, 
 and until recently{Bentall's,}who made
 one of the most important developments
 in the plough, were still an active   
 concern in Heybridge.                 
    The soil around Heybridge is dry   
 because there is much gravel under the
 surface so the water tends to drain   
 away very rapidly. So the farmers in  
 the area have constructed reservoirs  
 to provide a ready supply of water for
 their animals and crops.              
    Although there is some livestock   
 farming locally, by far the most      
 common type of farming is arable.     
 There are some peas and rape grown,   
 but the greatest crops are wheat and  
 barley which we estimate to comprise  
 around 80% of the crops grown.
