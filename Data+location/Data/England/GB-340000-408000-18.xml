		<title>18THE FUNCTIONS OF ORMSKIRK</title>
		<content> Ormskirk has many functions. On the   
 one hand it is a market town and a    
 dormitory town but it also has many   
 industries. However, the industries   
 are of a light nature and only the    
 engineering firm of Hattersleys is a  
 large employer of labour in the town. 
   The town and the surrounding        
 district suffers from a very high     
 unemployment rate, however, there are 
 many light jobs available on a part   
 time basis and on a seasonal basis on 
 the surrounding farms.                
   Ormskirk is an important service    
 centre. Many people come to shop even 
 on the non market days and there is a 
 wide variety of shops of all types    
 ranging from the small family run     
 bread and cake shops to large         
 furniture shops selling high quality  
 goods.For fashion goods, however, most
 people shop in Liverpool and Southport</content>
