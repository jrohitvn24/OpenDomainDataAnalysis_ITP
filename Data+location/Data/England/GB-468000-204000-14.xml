		<title>14Housing in Thame</title>
		<content>Housing is relatively expensive in     
Thame as it is in most of the south-   
east of England. A new first floor     
maisonette with a lounge, kitchen,     
bathroom and two bedrooms would cost   
about 35,000 pounds.                   
A semi-detached family home with 3 bed 
rooms, hall, dining room, lounge, bath-
room and separate toilet and a small   
garden costs about 50,000 pounds.      
There are plenty of older houses in our
area. For example, a terraced house    
built around the turn of the century   
with two bedrooms and an attractive    
garden is on sale near the centre of   
the town for 38,500 pounds.            
There are a few large older country    
houses in our area. These are usually  
very substantial houses, with 4-5      
bedrooms and 2 reception rooms. These  
sell for about 150.000 pounds though   
some cost around 250,000 pounds.       </content>
