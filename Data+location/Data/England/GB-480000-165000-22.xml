<title>22Wokingham Without: Pinewood Centre</title>
<content>

The Pinewood Centre is owned by Wokingham Borough Council and sublet to Wokingham Without Parish Council, which in turn sub lets various of the buildings and areas of land to a whole gamut of community clubs and societies.  The Parish Office is located at the Centre and is open to the public between the hours of  10am - 12noon.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Parish Council receives no financial support from the Borough Council (other than in the form of a low rent) and is fully responsible for maintaining and administering the site. The site is funded by the leasehold rental income and service charges generated by the sub leases, hourly rental fees from Pinewood Hall and supported by the parish precept i.e. the council tax paid by the 2,727 households in Wokingham Without.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Borough Council states that it recognises the strategic importance of the Pinewood Centre in terms of the recreational, sporting and community facilities of the Borough but this does not translate into any tangible financial support.&lt;br />&lt;br />Clubs &amp; Societies at Pinewood Centre (2011)&lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Football Club  &lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Allotment Association &lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Shooting Association &lt;br />&lt;br />East Berks Operatic Society &lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Bar and Cafe&lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Judo Club&lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Gymnastics Club&lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Miniature Railway Society Ltd &lt;br />&lt;br />Bracknell Railway Society &lt;br />&lt;br />Thames Valley Tug of War&lt;br />&lt;br />2nd Crowthorne Scout Group &lt;br />&lt;br />South East Berks Gang Show&lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Motorcycle Training Unit&lt;br />&lt;br />Jayne Coleman Academy of Dance &lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Raceway &lt;br />&lt;br />Starr Boxing Club&lt;br />&lt;br />Flying Start Nursery&lt;br />&lt;br />Wokingham &amp; Crowthorne Table Tennis Club&lt;br />&lt;br />Pinewood Short Mat Bowls&lt;br />&lt;br />Yoga&lt;br />&lt;br />British Red Cross Medical Loans&lt;br />&lt;br />Other facilities on the site include:&lt;br />&lt;br />Under-12 play area - limited range of equipment. &lt;br />&lt;br />Glass and Textile Recycling Banks&lt;br />&lt;br />Adventure Play area&lt;br />&lt;br />Almost 18 acres of woodland including pond and dipping platform &lt;br />&lt;br />Adult Trim Trail &lt;br />&lt;br />Community Orchard &lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
