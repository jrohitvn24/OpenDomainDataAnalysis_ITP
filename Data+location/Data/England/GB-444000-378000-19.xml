		<title>19Farming in Killamarsh</title>
		<content> On the farm they have got a lot of    
 hay and animals such as pigs,cows,    
 sheep,hens and dogs.The names are     
 Sheba and Tim.Mrs.Abajam has got a    
 tractor and a trailer and a combine   
 harvester.They keep the pigs and cows 
 and hens in stables.Some are round the
 back.In the summer they let the cows  
 in to the fields.The sheep live round 
 the back of the house.They live in a  
 little hut so the lambs can go        
 in.In Killamarsh there are a lot of   
 fields.You sometimes see tractors on  
 the roads because the farmers live    
 there or they are delivering hay to   
 people.The farming around Killamarsh  
 is very mixed and farms have crops and
 animals.It is good living near farms  
 and field because there is always     
 something happening in them.You can   
 always walk around the fields at      
 holiday time to see the farmers.      </content>
