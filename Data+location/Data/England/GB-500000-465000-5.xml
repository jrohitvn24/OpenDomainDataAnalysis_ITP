 In{July}it is nearly harvest time and 
 Stan our combine driver goes to get   
 the combine from my uncles who keeps  
 it there in winter because we don't   
 have room in our sheds while Stan is  
 doing that Dad is cleaning the corn   
 shed out with smoke generators that   
 kill little mites that make the corn  
 sweat and go mouldy.After the smoke   
 has cleared it is safe for Dad to go  
 in the shed. Now he can get the corn  
 tester set up.                        </content>
