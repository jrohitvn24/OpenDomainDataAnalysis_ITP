		<title>13LIFEBOAT STATION</title>
		<content> THE CAISTER-ON-SEA LIFEBOAT STATION   
    Mr. Ron Munford came to,our school 
 to talk about the Lifeboat station. In
 1857 the RNLI assumed responsibility  
 for the Lifeboat, and between 1867 and
 1929 two lifeboats were stationed at  
 Caistwr. In 1969 the RNLI withdrew    
 their lifeboat &amp; closed the station.  
 Up to this date the boats had saved   
 more lives than any other station in  
 the British Isles. After this date,   
 local Beach Men kept there long       
 tradition of Lifesaving and now       
 provide a private service, unique in  
 this country, under Mr.Munford's      
 leadership. Public support is VITAL to
 maintain this service.                
   They have two boats, one will carry 
 two crew, the other,the 'Shirley Jean 
 Adie',an ex-RNLI boat, carries 8 crew.
