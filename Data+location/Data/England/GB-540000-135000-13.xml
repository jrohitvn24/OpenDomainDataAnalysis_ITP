 There is not a great deal to do in    
 Forest Row.Life for the young is dull.
 On Monday night we have a Youth Club  
 in the village hall. There is always  
 some trouble between pupils from      
 Sackville School and those from the   
 Rudolf Steiner School.Gang fights do  
 occur but they are not very nasty.    
 Because there is nothing to do at     
 night we roam the streets and this    
 causes a lot of trouble between us and
 the old people. They say we are noisy 
 and rowdy but I think that they are   
 just miserable and grumpy.What we need
 in Forest Row is an all-night youth   
 club. This would keep us off of the   
 streets."The Old Swan Cafe" used to be
 open all-night but this shut years    
 ago.
