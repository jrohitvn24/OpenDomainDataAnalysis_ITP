		<content> Ennerdale Forest was formerly part of 
 the Ancient Royal Forest of Copeland  
 which was used for hunting and        
 progressively cleared through the ages
 .By Elizabethan times much of the     
 forest had been cut to provide        
 charcoal to smelt ore from the local  
 iron mines.There is evidence  of the  
 charcoal burners in Side Wood.Here    
 there are clearings surrounded by     
 large stones.The later introduction   
 of sheep prevented the regeneration   
 of the forest and for centuries sheep 
 grazing was the main land use.In 1925 
 the Forestry Commission began aquiring
 land in the area.Planting began in    
 1926 to help create a reserve of      
 timber to meet the nations need and to
 provide much needed jobs for the      
 unemployed miners of nearby Cleater   
 Moor.
