		<title>18Roman Wall Sheep Show</title>
		<content>   The Roman Wall Show is held every   
 June and is the first of the local    
 sheep shows. Farmers display their    
 best sheep in the hope that they will 
 win a cup, or even be named show      
 champion, which is a great honour and 
 a good excuse for a celebration.      
   There is a hound trail and a sheep  
 dog competition. For the children     
 there are sports with small prizes,   
 and for the really fit a strenuous    
 race over the nearest fell. In a large
 tent homecraft skills are on display, 
 the old art of stick dressing can be  
 seen, as well as childrens artwork and
 handwriting.                          
   Hot dog stands and a beer tent      
 provide refreshments when needed.     
 Visitors find the show rather old     
 fashioned but to local people it is a 
 day to look forward to, a good chance 
 to meet and gossip to friends.        </content>
