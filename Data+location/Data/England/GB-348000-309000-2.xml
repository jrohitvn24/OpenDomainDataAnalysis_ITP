		<title>02SOUTH SHREWSBURY LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content> The landscape is a gentle rolling one 
 which to the south reaches 1O4 metres 
 above sea level on the{Sharpstone Hill
 dropping to around 5O metres in the   
 north where the{Rea Brook}winds its   
 way to the{River Severn.}To the north-
 west the{Rad Brook}cuts deeply making 
 the landscape hilly. Housing has      
 tended to keep away from the brooks   
 leaving attractive, natural areas in  
 south{Shrewsbury.}More open spaces    
 have been created at the cemetery, the
 golf course and the large playing     
 fields of the{Technical College,}the  
{Comprehensive Schools}and{Shrewsbury  
{School.}Originally three railway lines
 arrowed towards the railway station   
 but only two are now operative the    
 other providing a foopath and cycle   
 track. Soon a new Shrewsbury By-pass  
 is to be built ridding Shrewsbury of  
 its through traffic congestion.       </content>
