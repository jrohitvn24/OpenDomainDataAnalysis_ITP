		<title>10TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>   Our traffic survey recorded cars,   
 buses, vans and lorries, motor cycles 
 and bicycles. We counted 347 cars     
 passing through one main road in only 
 half an hour.We talked to some people 
 to find out what kinds of transport   
 they used and for what purpose.       
   Most people in the area had their   
 own car and some of these thought they
 were cheaper to run than to use public
 transport. The people who used public 
 transport were not satisfied. They    
 thought they had to wait too long for 
 buses and that fares should be cheaper
 Everybody interviewed thought the     
 roads were in poor condition.Trains   
 and cars were thought to be more      
 reliable than buses.                  
   People mainly used public transport 
 for visiting, or shopping. many people
 travel by bus to Croydon or by train  
 to London to go to work.              </content>
