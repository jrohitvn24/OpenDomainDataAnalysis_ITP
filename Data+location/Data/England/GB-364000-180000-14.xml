		<content> 8.15am. Woke up by Amy again. I looked
 out of the window, it was raining     
 again. Amy and I went downstairs. Amy 
 fed Daisy, our cat, and I made a cup  
 of tea.                               
 9.25am. I did my exercises, the first 
 time for ages! Rebecca was already    
 doing her conditioning for gym,so I   
 watched her when I had finished.      
 9.50am. I had a shower, got dressed   
 and went down for breakfast. Jim,     
 Amy's dad, had made breakfast. We had 
 Weetabix and toast. I then went back  
 upstairs to finish getting ready. This
 got me out of the washing up!         
 10.30am. Did some washing and then put
 a chicken in the oven for lunch.      
 11.20am. Jim made me a cup of coffee  
 and then I started home work for a    
 typing exam I am taking soon. I'm not 
 doing too well so Barbara, from next  
 door, is going to help me tonight.    </content>
