		<content> IN 1985 AS IN MANY PLACES IN THE      
 COUNTRY,THERE IS AN EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM
 ICI IS GRADUALLY CLOSING DOWN PARTS   
 OF ITS FACTORIES IN NORTHWICH AND THIS
 MEANS THAT OTHER INDUSTRIES AND       
 SERVICES WHICH RELY ON ICI ARE CLOSING
 DOWN AS WELL.                         
 ICI HAS BEEN THE MAJOR EMPLOYER IN    
 NORTHWICH FOR MANY DECADES AND THIS   
 HAS MEANT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SECURITY
 OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THEIR WORKERS. AT   
 PRESENT THERE ARE FEWER JOBS AVAILABLE
 AND THESE JOBS  OFTEN INVOLVE TRAVEL. 
 AS ICI HAS MOVED TO MORE ECONOMIC     
 AREAS SO THEIR WORKERS HAVE BEEN      
 OFFERED JOBS IN THE NEW AREAS.THIS HAS
 MEANT EITHER MOVING OR TRAVELING.     
 IN OUR SURVEY OF ICI WORKERS 63 PER   
 CENT WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR WAGES AND  
 25 PER CENT WOULD TRAVEL TO OTHER     
 AREAS RATHER THAN MOVE TO THAT AREA.
