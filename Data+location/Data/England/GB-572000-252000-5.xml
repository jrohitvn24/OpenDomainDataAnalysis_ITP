		<title>05WICKHAMBROOK AND FARLEY GN</title>
		<content>Wickhambrook is a large village of     
scattered hamlets around small greens. 
There are eleven of these Greens.  Only
the southern part of the village is    
within this area, and two of the       
Greens: FARLEY GREEN and part of       
ATTLETON GREEN . FARLEY GREEN has only 
two or three farms and half a dozen    
houses including a former bakery and   
two modern bungalows.   It is a        
truly peaceful rural area - one former 
farm, SILVER LEY, was written about in 
a book of that name by ADRIAN BELL.    
(One of a series of books on farm life 
in Suffolk in the 1920s).  Peacocks    
Farm (16th cent) has a typical thatched
Suffolk farmhouse.  A thriving clay-   
pigeon club meets here and barn dances 
are held sometimes - in the barn !
