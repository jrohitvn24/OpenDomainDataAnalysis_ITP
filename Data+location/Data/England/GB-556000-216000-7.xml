{MUSHROOM FARM.                        
 Every Tuesday 20 ton of compost is    
 delivered and used to fill 256 growing
 boxes 4' x 3'. This is then           
 pasteurised to l40 F., and then       
 allowed to cool, so that on the       
 following Monday the spawn can be     
 added to the compost. This is then    
 covered with a layer of casing        
 material, chalk and lime. The boxes   
 are now taken to the growing house    
 where they are carefully monitored for
 the correct humidity, temperature, and
 water content.                        
 After 4 weeks the first flush of      
 mushrooms appear and are picked by    
 hand. There are 5 or 6 subsequent     
 flushes each lasting a week. The beds 
 are then exhausted. The cycle then re 
 starts.Yield 6 to 7 thousand lbs      
 weight mushrooms per week.            </content>
