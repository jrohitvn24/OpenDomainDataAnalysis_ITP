		<content>   In its halcyon days North Shields   
 was a successful port with trading    
 links all over the world.Sailors of   
 all nationalities frequented the busy 
 pubs and coffee houses and            
 superstitious seamen needed something 
 to act as a lucky charm before        
 embarking on long, dangerous voyages. 
 A wooden figure head, situated on     
 Custom House Quay had long provided   
 the lucky talisman for countless      
 sailors. A piece was pared, chipped or
 broken off to guard against the       
 dangers of the sea. Needless to say   
 such misuse led to her demise.
