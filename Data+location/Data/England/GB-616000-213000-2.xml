		<title>02CLACTON BEACH</title>
		<content> Clacton Beach is one of the reasons   
 why Clacton is so popular.            
 If you like diving there are groynes  
 for diving off.With groynes the sea   
 doesn't go out very far and the beach 
 levels vary.The Gunfleet Sailing Club 
 by the point lets you join in the     
 water activities like windsurfing,    
 yachting and canoeing.                
 The beach is just right for sunbathing
 enthusiasts and the sand is good for  
 making sandcastles,holes,etc.         
 Dogs are restricted from some beaches.
 Cyclists are not permitted to cycle on
 the lower,middle or upper promenade,  
 because they disturb the peace.       
 It is possible to walk along the beach
 from St. Osyth to the East, to        
 Walton-on-the-Naze in the West.
