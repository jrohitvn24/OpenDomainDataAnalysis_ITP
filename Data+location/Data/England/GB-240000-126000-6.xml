		<content> As in most rural areas, there is a    
 scarcity of public transport.  However
 a bus service runs, somewhat          
 infrequently,from Bideford,3 miles    
 away,to Clovelly and Hartland. A      
 recent survey showed that opinions    
 were equally divided as to its        
 usefulness. A majority of the         
 inhabitants, particularly in outlying 
 farms and districts not served by the 
 bus, rely on cars and motor-bikes.    
 This in turn leads to parking problems
 in the centre of Abbotsham, where the 
 older houses were built before the    
 advent of garages. This problem is    
 particularly acute when children are  
 being collected from school in the    
 afternoon. Therefore it is the old and
 the very young who rely most on public
 transport.
