		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content>  This four by three kilometres block  
 is a very rural area and farming is   
 the only industry.This consists mainly
 of intensively managed grassland and  
 dairy herds.                          
   The inhabitants of this area need   
 to have their own transport but there 
 is public transport in some of the    
 adjacent blocks.Churches,schools,post 
 offices and small village shops are   
 also in nearby squares.The doctor from
 Castle Cary has surgeries in church   
 halls,half an hour every day,again    
 adjacent to these blocks.             
   The area is sparsely populated.
