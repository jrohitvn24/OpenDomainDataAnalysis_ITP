		<content>   The Cozy Club is held for mentally  
 handicapped people who are less       
 fortunate then we are and a special   
 bus fetches handicapped elderly people
 to their own club.                    
   There are two youth clubs. One for  
 the younger children and one for the  
 older ones. Other clubs for children  
 include the art class and the jazz    
 band.                                 
   When school is not on the school    
 dining hall becomes a coffee bar which
 also sells hot dogs.                  
   The Community College also organises
 trips for both children and adults and
 also charity appeals as well as       
 arranging matches and fixtures with   
 other community associations or       
 recreation centres.                   
   I am nearly always down at the Comm 
 unity College. It has changed my life.
