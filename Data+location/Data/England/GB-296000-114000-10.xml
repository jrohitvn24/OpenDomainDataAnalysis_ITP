		<content>    At Craze Loman there is a small    
 cottage industry making soft toys.    
 This started off as a place of work   
 where there was once a mill and has   
 returned to a working factory. They   
 make six types of furry animals which 
 are dressed and undressed. In the     
 factory there are nine workers and    
 eighteen people work at home. The soft
 toys they make are sent to            
 America,Japan,Australia,Canada and    
 many other countries. Several are sent
 to outlets in the United Kingdom. One 
 of the most popular soft toys is a    
 Winnie the Pooh bear.                 
    The only other industry in the area
 is farming as the dairy at East Mere  
 closed down some years ago.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
