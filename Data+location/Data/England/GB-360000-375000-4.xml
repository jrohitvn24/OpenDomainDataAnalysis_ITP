 FARMING 3.DAIRY - The most common     
 breed of cattle is Friesian. The      
 average number of milking cows per    
 farm is 94.Each farm breeds large     
 numbers of heifers, the average being 
 52 per farm.These beasts are kept 12  
 months and are then sent to markets at
 Chelford or Beeston or are kept as    
 milking stock.Farms keep at least one 
 bull either Hereford stock (for cross 
 breeding) or pure Friesian.The average
 milk yield per cow in this area is    
 between l5 and l6 litres per day.The  
 cows are milked twice daily 6.30 a.m. 
 and 4.30p.m.Milk is collected by      
 tanker once a day.Yield varies        
 according to the season; the highest  
 yield is in the late spring and early 
 summer when rich pasture is available.
