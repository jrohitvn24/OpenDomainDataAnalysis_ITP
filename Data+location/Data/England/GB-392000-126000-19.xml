		<title>19ANSTY MAYPOLE NEAR WARDOUR</title>
		<content> The{Ansty Maypole}stands next to the  
{Maypole Inn.}It is the{highest}Maypole
 in{England.}We measured it our selves 
 but we checked with the Saw mill      
 owner.The pole stands{103}feet high.  
{Mr Ridley}put the Maypole in the      
 ground with the help of five men. It  
 is made from a{Douglas fir.}To keep   
 it secure the men planted it seven    
 feet in the ground. Placed on the top 
 is a{weather vane.}The whole village  
 0wns it and on Ansty May{(May 1st)    
 people come and feast and fair along  
 with dancing though the{Maypole}is so 
 tall that the ribbons often get       
 twisted so that it is hard to dance.  
 Nobody knows when the first maypole   
 was put up but we do know it was taken
 down in{1644}by an act of{Oliver      
{Cromwell's}parliament.{King Charles   
 allowed it to be put back in{1660.
