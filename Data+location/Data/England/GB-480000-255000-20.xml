		<content>Children of the junior section of      
Denton County Primary School were      
responsibe for collecting most of this 
information.The age range of those     
involved was 8-11 years.               
The object was to give as wide a view  
as possible of life in a village in    
Norhtamptonshire in the 1980s.         
Adult help was needed in transporting  
the pupils to visit farms etc;Thanks   
should therefore be recorded to all    
those willing volunteers who gave their
time or gave information for the       
project.                               
Thanks should also be recorded to army 
personnel who gave permission for the  
visit to Yardley Chase and members of  
the Northamptonshire Trust for Nature  
Conservation who accompanied the trip.
