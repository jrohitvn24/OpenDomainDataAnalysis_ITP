		<title>19The River Dee</title>
		<content> The River Dee divides the area into   
 two.There are only two ways to cross  
 the river, one is a footbridge on     
 private land, the other way is to go  
 out of the area and over a bridge at  
 Overton.                              
 The river is wide and there are no    
 rocks to obstruct the current. On the 
 banks of the river are a church and   
 the Boat Inn. The river floods in the 
 winter but it has never flooded the   
 buildings.                            
 There is good fishing in the river    
 which has salmon, trout, eel and      
 grayling. Fly fishing is the best     
 method of catching these fish.        
 A day's fishing costs Â£2, provided you
 have a rod licence.                   
 Further up the river at Pen-y-lan     
 there is private fishing for a        
 syndicate which takes about 40 salmon 
 a year.                               </content>
