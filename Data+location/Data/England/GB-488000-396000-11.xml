		<title>11S/N - Information Centres</title>
		<content> A Lincolnshire County Council         
 travelling library visits Northorpe   
 and Scotton once a fortnight, on a    
 Thursday morning, making one stop of  
 about half an hour in each village.   
 It carries a good selection of books  
 for adults and children, both fiction 
 and non-fiction; the two librarians   
 are helpful and books not on the van  
 may be ordered; up to six books may be
 borrowed at a time.  The village shop 
 provides an unofficial "information   
 centre" here as in many other villages
 (as does the pub in Scotton); news and
 gossip are exchanged and adverts and  
 notices are displayed. Scotton also   
 has a Parish Council notice board and 
 a Village Hall notice board. Daily    
 morning and evening papers are deliver
 -ed from the shop, youngsters working 
 as delivery boys. (Sunday papers are  
 brought in by an outside agent).      </content>
