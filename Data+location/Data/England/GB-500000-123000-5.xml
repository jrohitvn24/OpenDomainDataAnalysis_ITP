		<content> Hawkhurst Court, once a private school
 in 32 acres, is now a private estate  
 of 27 units. Each is being converted  
 to its new owner's requirements       
 without destroying the character of   
 the original structures. The main     
 building is now four 'townhouses',    
 each having part of the grounds behind
 as garden. The outbuildings and       
 lodges have been split into varying   
 sizes, and prices of these dwellings  
 range from #58,000 to #183,000. These 
 are freehold properties. Some of the  
 new owners were staff at the school,  
 but there is a mixed age range on the 
 estate, some families having children.
 All these dwellings have modern       
 facilities, of course, and double     
 glazing. A paddock of 20 acres is     
 expected to fetch between #2,500 and  
 #3,000 an acre as agricultural land.
