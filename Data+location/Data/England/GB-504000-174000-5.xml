		<content> All four parks have the usual play    
 grounds installed by the council,     
 Lauser and the Church park are also   
 big enough to play cricket, and on    
 Sundays you can usually find one of   
 the pub teams playing or practising on
 Lauser Park.                          
 Oaks Road is not large enough for     
 cricket, but it does have tennis      
 courts, a bowling green and miniature 
 golf. The tennis are well used in     
 summer and the courts are free, but   
 you have to provide rackets and balls.
                                       
 Apart from these, Stanwell has no more
 recreational areas. But, however there
 is a swimming pool and sports centre  
 nearby in Staines. There are many     
 small green spaces on the housing     
 estates. There is also a water sports 
 centre at Princes Club.
