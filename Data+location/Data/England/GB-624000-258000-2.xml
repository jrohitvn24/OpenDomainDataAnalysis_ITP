		<content> People in this part of Suffolk seem to
enjoy solitude.Despite the remote rural
aspect with few shops there are fairly 
frequent deliveries of milk,groceries &amp;
fish.There is a mobile library and a   
weekly refuse collection.Bus services  
are very infrequent with a service to  
Ipswich, the nearest large town,once a 
week,&amp; to the nearest small town also  
once a week.                           
 Many men go to work sharing cars on a 
rota basis so that their wives can have
the family car to meet children from   
school,take children to their          
activities such as cubs,brownies,music 
lessons etc. and also do the "bulk"    
shopping, go to meetings etc.
