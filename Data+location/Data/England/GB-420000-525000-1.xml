		<content> Shildon-the first railway town has now
 grown into a populated district of    
 about 14500 inhabitants. It is steeped
 in railway history and can claim to   
 have sent forth the first passenger   
 train to be hauled by steam engine.The
 town is situated near the southern    
 boundary of Co. Durham and the main   
 activities are now centred around     
 light industry following the demise of
 the wagon works and coalmining.The    
 earliest community probably existed in
 Roman times but there is also evidence
 of people living in Shildon in the    
 10th century.Extensive recent housing 
 development has considerably altered  
 the town,together with new shops,     
 public buildings and factory units.   
 However,the problems of unemployment  
 are paramount in this town,and despite
 initiatives to reduce the level,many  
 families exist on Social Security.    </content>
