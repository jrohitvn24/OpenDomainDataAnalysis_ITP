		<title>02The Tame Valley</title>
		<content> From Haughton Dale House 1713 a path  
 crosses the valley floor.Just beyond  
 ARDEN BRIDGE is a small picnic area   
 and a weir which once fed water to    
 Arden Mill.The rapids below the weir  
 show the power of the river which has 
 formed a steep sided valley. On the   
 near side of the river, a  boulder    
 lies in the water.Legend has it that  
 Robin Hood threw it from the top of   
 Werneth Low, two miles away.Soon you  
 are in Hulme's Wood.This scenic oak,  
 beech and sycamore woodland covers one
 of the old secrets of Denton-it was   
 once one of Lancashire's major coal   
 mining areas,and the wood grows on old
 spoil heaps.The wood is an area set   
 aside for nature study and offers a   
 flavour of history,people,industries  
 and natural features which have       
 helped to shape the area.
