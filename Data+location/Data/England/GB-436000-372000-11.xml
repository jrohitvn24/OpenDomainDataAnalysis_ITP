		<title>11Chesterfield Relief Road</title>
		<content>  The Chesterfield Inner Relief Road   
 was opened during the summer of 1985, 
 ten months ahead of schedule.The road 
 cuts across the eastern side of town  
 and follows much of the old Great     
 Central Railway line. The new road has
 resulted in a decreased &amp; consequently
 improved traffic flow through the town
 centre. Residents of Whittington Moor 
 express mixed feelings about the road.
 Some welcome it because it cuts down  
 journey time and gives easier access  
 to local shops and town centre. Other 
 residents have been upset by compuls- 
 ory moves to new homes resulting from 
 house demolition to make way for the  
 road. Shopkeepers on Sheffield Road   
 have reported a loss of business owing
 to decreased traffic flow.Many elderly
 pedestrians have expressed a fear of  
 subways which has virtually isolated  
 them on one side of the road.         </content>
