		<content> BROWNS FARM, LANDULPH CROSS.          
                                       
 Mr. Brown, tenant farmer, leases his  
 farm from the Duchy of Cornwall. The  
 Browns' have farmed the land for the  
 passed 25 years. Mr. Brown, his son   
 Richard and farm worker Mr. Billing   
 rear a herd of 65 Friesians for       
 milking and a few Herefords for beef. 
 Several of the farm fields are used   
 for turnips and corn as winter feed.  
 The milk yield for the farm can be as 
 high as 9 gallons and as low as 2     
 gallons a day from each cow. Total    
 milk yield per week averages 1500     
 gallons. Mrs. Brown keeps 2 dozen     
 chickens and sells the eggs locally.  
 Farm machinery consists of 3 tractors,
 2 small ploughs, 1 drill, 1 baler and 
 a shared harvester.
