		<title>13My Community-Cramlington.</title>
		<content> And there are a couple of community   
centres for old people.My community is 
Cramlington.Most houses are fairly     
modern,they were built in 1962.There   
are all constucted with reddish        
bricks, tiled roofs and a garden       
at the back and the front of the       
houses.Almost every house in the blocks
has a garage that can vary in size.    
Every house has a kitchen, living room,
bathroom and six bedrooms, and each    
house is centrally heated.People have  
extented their houses to personalize   
them adding double glazing, balconies  
etc.                                   
Cramlington is a New Town with a wide  
range of shops,leisure facilities and  
schools.The town centre is to the north
of our survey area.The Nelson          
Industrial Estate provides much        
employment in the area.
