		<content> Eastern National Bus Company provide a
 bus service five days a week to       
 Tumblers Green.  This service is      
 regularly used by schoolchildren who  
 travel into Braintree in the morning  
 and return home later in the          
 afternoon.  Greenstead Green has two  
 services, one of which goes to        
 Halstead on Market Days Tuesday's,    
 Friday's and Saturday's.  There is a  
 service to Braintree on Wednesday's   
 for the market held there.  Most      
 families have their own motor cars    
 which are very necessary living in a  
 rural community.
