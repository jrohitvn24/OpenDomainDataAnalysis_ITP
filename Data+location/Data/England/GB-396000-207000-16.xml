		<title>16WALKS ,DUNTISBOURNE AREA</title>
		<content> There are a few public footpaths in   
 the area,well marked by signposts but 
 not all passable today.Some staff of  
 Hucclecote School followed a route ,  
 marked on the up-to-date O.S.map,which
 started immediately South of Winstone 
 Church and cut diagonally across two  
 fields,passed Rectory Farm and joined 
 the road from Ermin Street into       
 Duntisbourne Abbots.The first field   
 was full,of barley so we had to divert
 around the side of the field and dodge
 the nettles and rabbit-holes.In       
 Duntisbourne Abbots we picked up the  
 second footpath which was our return  
 route to winstone.This was well marked
 and looked well walked.The footpath   
 follows a dry valley for half a       
 mile,crosses a track and passes       
 between two copses.A wide track leads 
 pleasantly up to Winstone ,ending at  
 Croft Farm,and 2 "listed" barns.      </content>
