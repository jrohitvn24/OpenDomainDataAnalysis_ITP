		<content> Area reference 5130 is mostly         
 residential and contains the majority 
 of the private housing to be found in 
 the study area. It can be divided in  
 to two main areas separated by        
 Blackpool Road (A5083). On the north  
 side are semi-detached houses built   
 just before the Second World War      
 (circa. 1930s). To the south some of  
 the houses are of similar age but     
 others are older, some dating back to 
 the 19th.century. Among these older   
 houses are many churches including St.
 Andrews and Sacred Heart.             
 Blackpool Road is the main road out of
 Preston in a westerly direction and   
 has several shops, garages, etc. along
 its length. The Preston to Blackpool  
 railway line also passes through the  
 square as do several bus routes.
