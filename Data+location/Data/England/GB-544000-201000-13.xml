		<title>13NEW MOTORWAYS NEAR EPPING</title>
		<content> Epping's major{motorway interchange}is
 at the south_east of Epping. The M25  
 brings vital communication links from 
 north,south,east,and west together. In
 1985 the M25 is nearly completed. The 
 section that is to pass near the M1 _ 
 the last section of the M25 _ will    
 cost{Â£21,000,000}to build.            
 The M25 orbital motorway reduces by   
 10% the amount of traffic through     
 Epping. The recent decision to expand 
{Stansted airport}will mean more       
 traffic on the{M11}and{M25,}house     
 prices will rise, and there will be   
 pressure on green belt land.          
 After 18 months in operation the M25  
 is used to 60% of its capacity. About 
{57,000}vehicles use it every day.     
 Not all people in the Epping area     
 welcome the M25, particularly those   
 affected by{noise and pollution.
