		<title>05HARDWICK VILLAGE</title>
		<content>{Hardwick}is a hamlet some three miles 
 north - west of Wellingborough. Its   
 population in the last census was 57  
 people, most of whom were between the 
 ages of 16 - 65.                      
 The main buildings today are the      
 church, Manor House and the old School
 (now a private house). The village has
 seen the population rise and fall     
 since 1801 when it had 68 people. Its 
 peak came in 1881 with 125 people and 
 from a similar population in 1931 it  
 has tended to fall to its present     
 number of 50 - 60 people. The village 
 has boasted a wheelwright (1874) and  
 two shops (1931). Today there is no   
 school, pub or shops. The village is Z
 shaped with most of the housing on an 
 L shaped through road. Most of the    
 houses are privately owned. Because if
 its isolation most people own cars.
