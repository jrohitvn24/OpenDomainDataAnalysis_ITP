		<title>12Mawthorpe Bygones Museum</title>
		<content> The 'Mawthorpe Bygones' is situated in
 Mawthorpe and is run by a local       
 removal contractor and his wife. They 
 also have a fairground organ and an   
 old steam engine which generates the  
 electricity for this. The collection  
 covers 3 acres and includes 4 sheds,  
 containing some of the several        
 thousand articles they have acquired  
 since 1955.                           
 At this time people were moving from  
 rural to urban areas and were leaving 
 bottles and jars behind which the     
 owners begged. Now people donate old  
 articles or, as he has a removal firm,
 he sees many old articles and has a   
 chance to buy them. His oldest article
 is an ox's shoe last used pre 1850.   
 The owners find that most of the      
 interest in the musuem comes from     
 other counties, as local people do not
 realise the variety of his collection.</content>
