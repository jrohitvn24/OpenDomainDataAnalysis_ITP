		<title>05INTERVIEW WITH RESIDENT</title>
		<content> This is Matthew Litten reporting from 
 Launceston Farm in the little Dorset  
 village of Tarrant Launceston.The lady
 I've interviewed is Mrs Strange who   
 has lived here at the farm for 43     
 years.She spoke to me from her fruit  
 garden which has strawberries,        
 rasberries,blackcurrants,gooseberries 
 and apples and pears growing in it.I  
 asked her what changes she had seen   
 over the years and she said that it   
 was the traffic which had changed     
 most.Cars zoomed up the narrow country
 lanes as if it was Brands Hatch.She   
 also said that most of the cottages   
 used to be lived in by farmworkers but
 now are owned by rich people often    
 retired.Mrs Strange said it was a     
 shame that the village shop at Monkton
 had closed as she had to shop in      
 Pimperne which was two miles away.
