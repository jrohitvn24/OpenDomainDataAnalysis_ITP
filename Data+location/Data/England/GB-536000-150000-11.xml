		<title>11Conoco Oil Exploration.</title>
		<content>   An{Oil Company}called{Conoco}started
 drilling  at   Palmer's  Wood ,   near
 Godstone,  and struck oil in l983 .  A
 group  of  children  from  our  School
 recently visited the site. The Manager
 met  us  and  gave  us  hard  hats  to
 protect our heads. We saw the{"Nodding
{Donkey"}pump  which  nods {8} times  a
 minute  and pumps out{2}gallons of oil
 each stroke.    This pump replaced the
 original derrick.  The Drill goes down
{995 feet }and pumps up {335 barrels}of
 oil a day.  Each barrel is worth {$25}
 and {12-13 tanker loads}leave the site
 each  week.       Conoco  are  seeking
 permission to drill at Coney Hill sand
 pit  to  the  West of Oxted and Broom-
 lands Farm  to  the  East.  They  have
 sent letters to thousands of residents
 in{Godstone}and{Oxted}to explain their
 operations, &amp;  are holding an exhibit-
 ion in St. Mary's Church Hall.        </content>
