		<title>10SPEKE HALL.....</title>
		<content>   Speke Hall is situated about 8 miles
 from  the  centre of  Liverpool on the
 north bank of the Mersey,and is one of
 the  best  examples  of  half-timbered
 houses in the country.                
    The building was started in 1490 by
 Sir William Norreys.  During the 16th.
 century   it   assumed   its   present
 quadrangular form around  an  enclosed
 courtyard.    The  original  moat  has
 disappeared,   but the  building looks
 much the  same as it  did  towards the
 end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.
       The hall was owned by the Norris
 family until 1797,  when it was bought
 by Richard Watt, a wealthy West Indian
 merchant.Basically,the interior of the
 hall  reflects the  taste and planning
 of  the  Norris  family  in  the  16th
 century,   but   there   is  also  the
 influence of the 19th century....
