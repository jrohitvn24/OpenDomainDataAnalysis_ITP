		<content> In Grainthorpe,                       
 There are so many things              
 I really can't keep up.               
 In Grainthorpe,                       
 There are houses,                     
 With fields on every side,            
 With gardens with lots of flowers in  
 A lovely scent to smell.              
 The bees buzz round the beehive,      
 The blue birds tweet and sing,        
 They are making such a lovely noise   
 It makes my mind just ring.           
 It's lovely in the garden,            
 The sun is shining down,              
 It is so very hot today               
 I have to wipe my brow.               
 The trees are blowing in the wind     
 It's starting to get cold.            
 It's been a lovely day today,         
 The sun has been like gold.           
 As I am tucked up in my bed           
 I dream sweet dreams this night.      </content>
