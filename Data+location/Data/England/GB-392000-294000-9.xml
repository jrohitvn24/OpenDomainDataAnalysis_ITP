		<content>Last Friday I was ill. I got up at half
past nine and went downstairs to have  
breakfast. I had Rice Krispies and a   
cup of tea.  Back upstairs I watched   
TV. On Central there was as a programme
called "Sport Billy" so I switched to  
BBC 2 and saw Snooker. Soon my mother  
called me to go to ASDA stores with    
her. When there I selected the best    
trolley. At first we went round the    
Toy Department, then around the clothes
My mother bought me a grey body warmer 
coat it had BMX on the top.            
Next we got butter and cheese,bacon    
and sausage. When we got back home I   
called for my friend Darren. We went   
to play by the brook. We climbed up the
sides of the bank. At night we went out
at the front of my house to play "SPY".
We went indoors at 11-30 p.m. Then I   
went to bed but I could not sleep. I am
ten years old.                         </content>
