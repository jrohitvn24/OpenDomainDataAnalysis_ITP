		<content> There is a friendliness amongst people
 &amp; a concern for all in these rural    
 communities,so old age or ill health  
 is not left unhelped:in spite of soc- 
 ial &amp; other changes,there is still    
 time for the minor courtesies.Good    
 community spirit lends support to loc-
 al functions &amp; the parishes have the  
 reputation for giving generously to   
 charity.There is a strong attachment  
 to the parish church both as an anc-  
 ient &amp; historic building &amp; as a symbol
 of the community even though 'our'    
 parsons have to be shared with neigh- 
 bouring parishes &amp; many people rarely 
 attend services except for the festiv-
 als. Periodic attempts to combine 2 or
 more parishes to give 1 Parish Council
 or Parochial Church Council are res-  
 isted &amp; have always been unsuccessful.
 There is an obstinate determination to
 retain independence &amp; identity.       </content>
