		<content>  Each morning at eight a minibus takes
 people to work in Bishop' Stortford   
 and it brings them back about five in 
 the evening.                          
  At school a minibus calls at school  
 nd takes a quarter of the children    
 home in two journeys to Stocking      
 Pelham and Brent Pelham. The qarter of
 the children who live in Furneux walk 
 to school and the other children go on
 school runs with other children who   
 live near them in cars.               
  Most children at school have a bike  
 to get around on. Once a year there is
 a course for older children to teach  
 them Cycling Proficiency and they pass
 if the examiner thinks they are safe  
 on the road.                          
  It is difficult for anyone to get    
 around if they do not have their own  
 transport as there are only teo buses 
 a week.                               </content>
