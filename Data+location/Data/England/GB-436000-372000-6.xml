		<content>  Chesterfield &amp; District Crematorium  
 is situated about two miles to the    
 north-east of the town near to        
 Brimington. There are nine full-time  
 staff and one part-time cleaner. Three
 of those employed work on the upkeep  
 of the grounds which are kept in      
 excellent condition with many rose    
 beds and hundreds of trees dedicated  
 to those who have been cremated there.
  Applications for cremation come from 
 a wide area including Bakewell,Darley-
 Dale, Tideswell, Buxton, Mosborough,  
 Harthill, Worksop, Alfreton &amp; Belper. 
  On average forty cremations are      
 carried out each week giving an       
 overall total of some two thousand    
 each year. The cremation service is   
 strictly limited to thirty minutes in 
 order to maintain a fairly constant   
 flow. A Book of Remembrance is on view
 and opened for each day of the year.  </content>
