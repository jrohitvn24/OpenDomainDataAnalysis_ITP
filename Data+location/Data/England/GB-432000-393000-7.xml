		<title>07ECCLESFIELD CHURCH</title>
		<content> In 1803-4 England was at war with     
 France and in the event of an invasion
 Ecclesfield formed a Dads Army        
 called"Ecclesfield Parish             
 volunteer Infantry".They never saw    
 service but their bugles and swords   
 hang on the north wall of the         
 church.By the vestry door there is a  
 13th century chest which was made out 
 of one tree trunk.There are four locks
 on the chest because anyone wanting to
 break into the chest would have to    
 steal 4 keys instead of one.
