 The block includes the greater part of
 the village of Yalding, much of the   
 village of Nettlestead and parts of   
 the villages of Hunton, West Farleigh 
 and Wateringbury. As the major village
 is Yalding, an active community, most 
 references concern Yalding. The       
 villages lie in the picturesque Medway
 valley at the place where the river   
 has cut its way through the Lower     
 Greensand ridge. It is primarily an   
 agricultural area, the chief crops    
 being hops, fruit and cereals. There  
 is a demand for a great deal of       
 seasonal casual labour. Oast houses,  
 orchards, hop gardens and rivers are  
 features of the landscape. Yalding is 
 particularly attractive, with a       
 medieval bridge, rivers, canal and    
 lock, and with a wealth of buildings, 
 some dating from medieval times.      </content>
