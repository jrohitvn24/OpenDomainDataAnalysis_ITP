		<title>01HECKFIELD AND BRAMSHILL</title>
		<content> The lanscape itself, open farmland and
 heath falling away to the Whitewater  
 and Hant Rivers, has remained         
 unchanged this century. There has beeb
 a very substantial increase in the    
 volume of traffic mainly through the  
 area to the growing industrial and    
 commercial estates of Reading and     
 Basingstoke. At the turn of the       
 century the population of Heckfield   
 was about 1000. The reduction in      
 agricultural labour has brought the   
 present population (adult) to about   
 250, housed in scattered hamlets. The 
 three main houses, Heckfield Place    
 (Georgian), Highfield House (Georgian)
 and Bramshill (Jacobean) have all     
 become training centres for Racal,    
 Digital Equipment and the Police      
 respectively. The school has closed   
 and besides a farm shop there are no  
 retail facilites in the area.         </content>
