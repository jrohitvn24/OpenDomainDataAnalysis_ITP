 porch was built  around 1500.In 1962  
 the roof was restored.The door which  
 was moved to the outside of the porch 
 dates from the 16th century.The nave  
 and the chancel are from the original 
 building.The north isle was added in  
 the late 16th century .The font which 
 dates from the 17th century was used  
 for a while as a tea-caddy in Swakelys
 House .During the 17th century the    
 mortuary chamber was added by the     
 Haringtons of Swakelys. In 1914 30    
 coffins were removed and reburied in
