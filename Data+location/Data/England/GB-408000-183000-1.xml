		<content>  The parishes of{Lydiard Millicent}and
{Lydiard Tregoze}are situated west of  
 Swindon and partly within the borough 
 of Thamesdown .                       
  The{western expansion of Swindon}has 
 brought about substantial social      
 changes.                              
  The population has increased, new    
 housing estates or{"urban villages"   
 have been built, the economy has      
 changed from agricultural to          
 industrial and many people commute    
 via the{M4 motorway}.                 
  A tributary of the{River Ray}rises in
 the western sector and flows north-   
 eastwards acting as boundary between  
 the parishes. There is a ridge of     
 brash soil overlying{Corallian        
{limestone}in the north, but the       
 predominantly clay soil supports      
{dairy farming.}
