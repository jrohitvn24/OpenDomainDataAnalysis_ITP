		<content>       There is a small first school in
 the village of Winterborne Kingston.  
 It is attended by children of five to 
 nine years old from Winterborne       
 Kingston and several neighbouring     
 villages. At the present time there   
 are forty one children in the school  
 with two teachers. The school has a   
 playing field and a swimming pool.    
       At the age of nine all the      
 children go to St. Leonard's Middle   
 School in Blandford. When they are    
 thirteen they got to Blandford Upper  
 School, where they may stay until they
 are eighteen.                         
       There are free school buses to  
 take the children into Blandford every
 day.                                  
       A lot of children go to         
 universities or polytechnics and      
 others attend colleges in Bournemouth 
 or Weymouth.                          </content>
