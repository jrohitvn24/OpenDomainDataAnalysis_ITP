		<title>13FARMING WEST OF THE SEVERN</title>
		<content>  The land here is flat and around 52  
 meters high with gentle slopes towards
 the river.The land is open with some  
 forest cover.The main crop is winter  
 barley with a break crop of sugar beet
 every 4 years.                        
  It is farmed between the two farms of
{Manor &amp; Moor Ridding}two thirds of the
 grain produced is used for the feeding
 of dairy cattle of which Moor Ridding 
 has 100.It also has 45 pigs and 350   
 sheep.This farm tries to be as self   
 sufficient as possible with least     
 capital as possible invested.         
  The land was once quarried for sand  
 and gravel.The sandy soils are not    
 naturally fertile. To overcome this,  
 waste from the local sewage works is  
 ploughed into the fields{(NOT DURING  
{STRONG WINDS).}During dry summers     
 irrigation is applied from the river  
 producing higher yields than normal.  </content>
