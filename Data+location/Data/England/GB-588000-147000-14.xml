		<content> Egerton Youth Club meets weekly except
 during the summer months and uses the 
 Hall and adjoining Games Barn for its 
 activities.                           
 The Hall is used as a Polling Station 
 for Local and Parliamentary Elections.
 The Parish Council meets monthly.     
 The adjoining Games Barn was erected  
 by a joint local effort in 1965 to    
 meet the needs of an expanding Youth  
 Club. The Hall is available for       
 dances, private parties and wedding   
 receptions, and is licensed for music 
 and dancing. Other uses are for fund  
 raising events for local organisations
 and charities, and by the Blood       
 Transfusion Service as a centre for   
 donors.
