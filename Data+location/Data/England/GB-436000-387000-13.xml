		<content>   The{Attercliffe}area has changed    
 drastically, even just in the last    
 thirty years. Then the area was       
 covered with steel works and terraced 
 housing with outside toilets. Most of 
 the works are closed now and derelict.
   When I was young men finished work  
 at 5.30 and poured out of the mills,  
 filling the streets. There was not    
 much unemployment, you could change   
 jobs quite easily. Local shops stayed 
 open later so that people go in after 
 work. There was a pub or{'beer-off'   
 (off-licence)on every corner_ it was  
 thirsty work in the steel mills.      
   There were also a lot of picture    
 houses. They have now changed to      
 'Bingo' halls, or become the sites for
 supermarkets or petrol stations. It   
 was possible to see a different film  
 every night in Attercliffe.
