		<content>{ROXBY CHURCH_}Dedicated to St.Mary is 
 a stone building of 14C architecture. 
 It has a low unbuttressed western     
 tower containing 3 bells. The south   
 transept contains an ancient effigy   
 which appears to have been erected    
 over the remains of some religious    
 person. The register dates from 1694. 
 Recently (1984-85) restoration has    
 been carried out by the "Manpower     
 Services".                            
{APPLEBY CHURCH_}The church consists of
 a broad low chancel. There is a       
 spacious vestry on the north side. The
 chancel opens through a broad 14C arch
 into a nave with three bay north and  
 south arcades with octagonal and      
 quatrefoil piers with nailhead        
 ornament in the capitals and lovely   
 proportioned double arches. There is a
 19C south porch and a broad western   
 tower built in four stages.           </content>
