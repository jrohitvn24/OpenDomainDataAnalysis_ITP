Manager, Maurice Williamson, has a     
staff of 60 to run a site of some 250  
acres on which stand four steel towers 
reaching to 350 feet and 40 masts      
standing up to 500 feet. There are 14  
"Senders" (as the BBC calls the        
powerful machines) that pump out the   
signal to the aerial displays (47 in   
all) that are strung between the       
towers and masts. On the hill there are
18 lattice steel masts from 150-500 ft 
tall.                                  
 4 steel towers from 115-365 feet, 22  
tubular masts from 80-150 feet, 13     
single band, 30 dual band, one four    
band and three Rhombics make a total of
47 aerials covering all the H.F.       
broadcast bands from 4 to 26 MHz. All  
arrays are directional with reversible 
reflectors, giving the station the     
capability of broadcasting to the world</content>
