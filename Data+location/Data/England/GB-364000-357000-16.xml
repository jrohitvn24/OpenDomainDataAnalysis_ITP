		<title>16ASTON-J-M SEWAGE WORKS</title>
		<content> The{sewage works}in the South of the  
 region covers about 5 acres and       
 processes the raw untreated sewage    
 from Crewe. It runs on a{sludge       
{digestion system}. Sewage is sent by  
 gravity feed through under- and over- 
 ground pipes and after being broken   
 down into sludge by aerobic bacteria  
 it is sent into large sealed tanks    
 called digesters.Here it is heated and
 further broken down releasing{Methane 
 gas, which is used for heating the    
 digesters.{Waste water}is sent into   
 the River Weaver and the{processed    
{sludge}is then dehydrated and pressed.
 This harmless waste product can then  
 be used as fertiliser or spread on the
 land. The works is continually        
 monitored and maintained by a small   
 team of workers, including a chemist  
 and a mechanic.
