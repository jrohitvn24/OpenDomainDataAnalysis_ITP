		<content> Horton Priory stands in its own       
 grounds off Moorstock Lane about half 
 a mile North of the main A20 road.It  
 was featured in the original Domesday 
 Book as being part of baronial lands  
 given to Hugo de Montfort by William  
 The Conqueror.Hugo's daughter married 
 Robert de Vere who gave land for a    
 Priory to be built for Cluniac Monks  
 in 1144.The priory was a cell of the  
 Church of St.Pancrace at Lewes in     
 Sussex.                               
 The Priory flourished over the        
 centuries until Henry VIII dissolved  
 the monasteries.The last Prior,Richard
 Gloucester,alias Brisley,surrendered  
 the priory to Henry who gave it to    
 Archbishop Thomas of Canterbury and he
 in turn let it to Sir Richard         
 Tate.During the next 400 years the    
 building had various owners until     
 1912.                                 </content>
