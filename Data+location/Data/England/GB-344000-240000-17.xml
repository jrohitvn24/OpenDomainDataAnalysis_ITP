		<content> Most households in the block have at  
 least one car. Public transport       
 consists of buses to and from         
 Hereford, some of these being local   
 services but others serving outlying  
 rural areas, especially on Hereford   
 market day (Wednesday) and Saturday.  
 These are run by several private      
 operators as well as the Midland Red  
 Company.                              
 There are no canals or railways, but  
 the course of a dismantled railway    
 from Hereford to Hay-on-Wye can still 
 be seen.                              
 The nearest airports are at Bristol,  
 Birmingham and Cardiff.               
 The River Wye, a stretch of which runs
 through the block, is not used for    
 trade, being navigable only by small  
 boats and canoes.
