		<title>01LAND IN STRETTON VALLEY</title>
		<content>    Our block is a{rural area}to the   
 north of Church Stretton. The village 
 of All Stretton lies in the valley    
 between the hills. The Long Mynd with 
 its batches is along the western side 
 and Caer Caradoc and part of Helmeth  
 stretch along the eastern edge.       
    Nearer to Church Stretton there is 
 a small housing estate and two        
 schools. The primary school and the   
 comprehensive school, for children up 
 to 16, share the same site. Some      
 children from both schools travel in  
 by school bus from nearby villages.   
    Three roads and a railway pass     
 through the valley; the busy A49 road,
 the old Shrewsbury to Ludlow road and 
 the very old Watling Street.          
    Most visitors to Church Stretton go
 to see Carding Mill Valley. There are 
 lots of beautiful views and on a clear
 day you can see for miles.            </content>
