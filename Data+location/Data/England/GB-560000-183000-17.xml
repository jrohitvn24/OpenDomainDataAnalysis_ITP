		<content>   Most of the{buildings}in our village
 are{detached}or{semi-detached}houses  
 and bungalows. Most of them are built 
 of{brick}with roofs of{clay tiles.}   
 Most of the houses have{garages,}     
 usually constructed of{brick, wood}or{
{metal. }                              
   The{village shop} is an important   
 building. It is about{85 years old}and
 it is the only shop in the village.   
   A new close of houses has just been 
 built, called{Bulphan Green.}The close
 contains seven detached houses,       
 screened by tall trees. Some of us    
 like the new houses; they are built in
 a{mock-tudor}style and we feel that   
 they brighten the place up. We don't  
 think any more should be built though,
 as so many new houses are being built 
 in the spaces between older houses and
 the village is beginning to look very 
 crowded.                              </content>
