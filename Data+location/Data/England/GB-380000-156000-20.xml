		<content> Though the farm is up to date you can 
 still see a{daub and wattle wall}and  
 hand made bricks. It covers 160 acres 
 with 100{Freisians}and{70 young stock 
 .It is run by the farmer with 2       
 workers and 1 student. The student is 
 important for farming's future. About 
 120 cows are born a year with 7 sets  
 of twins. The cows produce{600,000    
{litres of milk annually.}The farmer is
 not a vegetarian but loves his animals
 and send them directly for slaughter  
 rather than being prodded and         
 frightened at market. His favourite   
 parts of farming are being with       
 animals, having a different job to do 
 each day, taking a pride in what he is
 doing. He dislikes getting up early on
 a cold winter's day.
