		<content> As soon as I go downstairs in the     
 morning I put the T.V. on if mum and  
 dad are not already up. I watch T.V.  
 for a while and then I go and get     
 dressed. When I am dressed I come back
 down and make a drink of tea or       
 coffee, have a slice of bread and jam 
 or toast. Then as it is Saturday I get
 out one of my library books and settle
 down to read. After about an hour I go
 and get my sister up and we go out to 
 play. When my mum gets up she sends us
 out to the shop for something for our 
 dinner. After dinner we go shopping to
 Fine Fare supermarket. When we come   
 back we have our tea and go for a     
 walk. When we get in we have our      
 supper and go to bed.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
