		<content> The owners of Prestbury Farm have     
 lived there for forty years.The 2.43  
 hectares that they own is grazing     
 land.                                 
 They used to have 12.96 hectares but  
 they sold the other 10.53 ha.         
    Before they retired they sold milk 
 and cattle.                           
    They have a small garden in which  
 they grow vegetables,such as beans,   
 beetroot and carrots.These are sold to
 people in the area.                   
    There used to be many more farm    
 buildings before the owners retired,  
 but a lot of them were pulled down    
 because they were not being used.     
    They say it is much worse for      
 farmers in 1985 than in the 1970's,   
 because of the Common Market polices.
