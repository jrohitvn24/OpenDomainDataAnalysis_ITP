 Get a line of people.The first person 
puts his left hand through his legs and
the next one holds it with his right   
hand and this is repeated down the     
line.The whole line moves backwards and
the last person lies down as the line  
moves over him.This goes on till       
everyone is lying down holding hands.  
The line then gets up and moves forward
into orignal place.                    
{French Skipping}                      
 You need a long loop of elastic.Two   
people stand inside this and stretch it
round their ankles.A third person      
standing in the middle jumps backwards 
and forwards over the elastic to a     
pattern.When the pattern is finished   
the elastic is moved up to knee level  
and the pattern is repeated.The elastic
rises until the skipper fails, then    
someone else takes a turn.             </content>
