		<content> Newton Rigg Agricultural College.     
 This collage was founded in 1897, but 
 at that time was a farm school, not a 
 college.  when it first opened there  
 were 8 full time students, now in 1985
 there are 180 full time students and  
 over 600 part time students.  The     
 courses provided in 1897 were         
 agricultural only, but in 1985 courses
 are run in horticulture, agriculture, 
 forestry machinery and land use and   
 reclemation.  During the winter the   
 home ecomonics department run a wide  
 variety of homecroft classes, open to 
 anyone at a reasonable fee.  The      
 students come from the four corners of
 the country and form overseas.  In    
 1985 there are students from as far as
 Vanatu and Fiji, and as near as 2     
 miles away.  Each year the college    
 runs a special course on forestry for 
 overseas students.                    </content>
