		<title>03MARTINSHAW WOOD,GROBY.</title>
		<content>    This historical wood,mentioned in  
 the original Domesday Book,has come   
 under the threat of development in    
 recent times.It lies west of Groby and
 to the north of Ratby and covers an   
 area of some 254 acres and contains   
 approximately one million trees.      
 Prehistoric and Medieval earthworks   
 still exist as does evidence of the   
 county's only remaining Medieval      
 charcoal burning site.The Forestry    
 Commission bought the wood in 1950 and
 four years later began an extensive   
 planting programme which lasted until 
 1969.This involved the planting of    
 over half a million trees,mainly      
 conifers.Some of the old wood survives
 and this helps to boost the total     
 number of tree species to 36.The wood 
 was bisected by the M1 in 1966 and    
 this with the conifer planting has    
 lessened scientific interest.         </content>
