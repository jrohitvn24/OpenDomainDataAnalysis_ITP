		<title>04THE CLOCKS OF STROUD</title>
		<content>   Sim's Clock is a well-known local   
 landmark,built in the 1920's at the   
 junction of the five roads in the     
 centre of Stroud.Two of the roads,John
 Street and Russell Street were named  
 after Lord John Russel, the great     
 reformer, who was once M.P.for Stroud.
  'Town Time'is to be found on the wall
 between to shops near the junction of 
 four roads.This time-piece,originally 
 a clock-maker's regulator,was made in 
 1858.The production of railway        
 timetables made it essential that time
 should be the same all over the       
 country; previously time had not been 
 standardised.                         
  The Black Boy Jack Clock was made by 
 John Miles of Kendrick Street in      
 1774.The clock has the figure of a    
 negro dressed in a bay leaf type skirt
 ,in front of which is a bell hit by a 
 club in the black boy's right hand.   </content>
