		<title>15A TYPICAL SATURDAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 9 a.m. I get washed and   
 dressed and then get my breakfast     
 which is usually rice crispies. At 10 
 a.m. I go to Mass, then I go to a     
 coffee morning at the Crescent centre 
 where the warden lives. It runs from  
 10 a.m. to 12 noon. That's when I have
 my dinner, I have a little snack like 
 a couple of sandwiches and some milk. 
 After dinner I go up my gran's to see 
 if my cousins are there. At 1 p.m. I  
 take my dog for a walk to the "rec."  
 At 1.30 p.m. I read or draw for an    
 hour. At 2.30 there is usually a film 
 so I watch that for an hour. At 3.30 I
 usually make a dessert for tea. At    
 4.00 my Mam's friends come for a tea. 
 We use the good crockery. After that I
 draw or read for an hour. At six I    
 take the dog for a walk. At 6.30 I    
 watch T.V. until bedtime.
