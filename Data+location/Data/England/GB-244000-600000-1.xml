		<title>01Ness Glen and Loch Doon Dam</title>
		<content> At the Northern end of the five mile  
 long Loch doon, a dam, rebuilt in 1933
 to provide storage for hydro-electric 
 scheme, controls the flow of the river
 Doon which has carved a course for    
 itself northwards between magnificent 
 100 foot high granite cliffs, known as
 the Ness Glen.  Above the head of this
 glen stands the house of Craigengillan
 sheltered by variegated woodlands,    
 which was the home of one of the      
 branches of the McAdam family.  Behind
 these woods the grassy moor land      
 stretches away to the South and to the
 west with scattered burns and hill    
 lochs to the encircling plantations of
 Carrick Forest, which has been        
 replanted by the Forestry Commission  
 since the days when it provided a     
 hiding place for Robert the Bruce.
