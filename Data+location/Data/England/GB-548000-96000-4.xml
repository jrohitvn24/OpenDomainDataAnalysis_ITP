     The Old Town Hall is now the hall 
 of{St.John's Ambulance Brigade}.It    
 seems incredible as it has served as a
 Town Hall,courthouse and jail for over
 300 years.Its appearance has been     
 changed in that the staircase entrance
 door and the spire have been altered. 
 Underneath was the jail.The entrance  
 goes to the town hall and an outer    
 staircase led to a small court room.  
     At one end was a chair for the    
 Baliff(he was the magistrate).Benches 
 on either side were for the Jurats.   
 Town Records,reports and many trials  
 were held here.An example of a crime  
 was John Gordon who was sent to the   
 notorious{Botany Bay}for 7 years.     
 Alterations were once carried out:a   
 Tudor stone gateway was removed from  
 here.                                 </content>
