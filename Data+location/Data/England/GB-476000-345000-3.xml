		<content> On Thursday my dad got up at 0600,    
 dressed and had some toast. He        
 made a flask of coffee and some       
 sandwiches for work. He starts at     
 0730. His first job was clearing      
 machinery to make room for the round  
 bales of silage. At 0900 he has his   
 break.At 0930 he put the bale spike on
 the loader. Then dad made a feed mix  
 for the cattle and sheep.             
      Tractors, trailers, baler, and   
 loader went down to the field. A      
 mechanic came to set up the new       
 baler.At first they could not get it  
 working properly. Dad and Ray were    
 unloading hay until 1300. He had      
 dinner then went back at 1400. The    
 silage bales were  put into bags,tied 
 and then stacked.My dad finished work 
 at 20.00.He did the crossword,then    
 went for a drink and to see some      
 friends.He went to bed at 2330.       </content>
