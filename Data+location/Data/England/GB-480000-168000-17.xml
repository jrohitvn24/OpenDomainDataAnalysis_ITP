 tier in the local government chain    
 housing its offices at the town hall  
 in the market place. There are eight  
 wards served by the town council with 
 24 elected town councillors. The      
 council has committees for finance and
 general purposes, amenities and       
 planning.                             
   In l822 the town council was granted
 a {charter by Queen Victoria }making  
 it a borough with an elected mayor.   
 The district council has existed since

 l974. It is the middle tier of        
 government covering almost 70 square  
 miles in the centre of Berkshire.

 top tier of local government.
