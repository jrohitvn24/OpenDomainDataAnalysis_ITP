		<title>02SOUTH MOOR GREENLAND SCHOOLS</title>
		<content> The school opened in 1909 for the full
 age-range,but now there are separate  
 Infant and Junior departments.They are
 village schools,with few children from
 outside the area.The Junior school    
 role now stands at 194 and the Infants
 at 162.There are 7 unstreamed Junior  
 classes with mixed age-groups in the  
 1st,2nd and 3rd Years.More than 30% of
 the children have free dinners because
 of high unemployment in the area.     
 In the Junior school there are 7      
 classrooms,a staffroom,a remedial     
 reading room, a library/computer room,
 a music room and an Art/Craft room.   
 There are 2 main halls,the larger used
 for assemblies,the smaller as a dining
 area.Both are used as multi-activity  
 areas.Council playing fields half a   
 mile away are used for any sporting   
 fixtures.
