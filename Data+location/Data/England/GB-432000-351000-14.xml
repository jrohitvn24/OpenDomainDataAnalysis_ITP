		<title>14British Gas</title>
		<content> The British Gas buildings were built  
 in 1967, and opened in 1968.The       
 Cromford Canal was blocked off to     
 make the works. It was on the site of 
 Clay Cross Iron and Steel works.      
 Before 1973 the works produced and    
 distributed town gas,but since then   
 people have used natural gas because  
 it is cleaner , and more convenient,  
 but it was so dangerous because it had
 no smell  so they gave it a special   
 smell to see when the pipes have bust 
 or when they is a leak. They have a   
 little bit of liquified natural gas   
 left in storage tanks but next year   
 that will be gone to, so now the      
 British Gas is used as a maintenance  
 centre. They mend pipes all over the  
 country.
