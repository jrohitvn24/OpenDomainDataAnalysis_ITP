 development of Upminster.Much of the  
 population of Upminster commute to    
 London using the regular main line and
 tube services.The 4500 people using   
 the station do so mainly in the{rush  
{hour}between 7:30 and 9:30 in the     
 morning into London and 5:00 and 7:00 
 in the evening returning.             
   Employment is provided for some 14  
 people.The station has recently had
