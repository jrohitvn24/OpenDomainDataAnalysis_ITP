		<title>01THE HIGH CROSS AREA.</title>
		<content> The area around High Cross is         
 predominantly rural. Apart from{"HIGH 
{CROSS VILLAGE"}itself,there are only a
 few small and scattered hamlets. These
 include;{"BAKERS END"}which is no more
 than a few large farm houses around a 
 duck pond;{"BABBS GREEN"}which is now 
 a modern housing estate connected to  
 Wareside; and{"COLD CHRISTMAS"}which  
 has a row of farming cottages. Farming
 is the main activity of the area. The 
 landscape is beautiful and despite    
 being so near London,it remains remote
 and unspoilt. The area is divided by  
 the{"RIVER RIB"}which is a tributary  
 of the River Lee. Along its banks and 
 in the local woodland,wildlife is     
 abundant. A well used network of      
 public footpaths cross the area. The  
 only area of sizable population is    
 High Cross village,along the A.10     
 London to Cambridge road.             </content>
