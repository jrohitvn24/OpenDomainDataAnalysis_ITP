		<content> First we saw a man cutting material   
 with a hand shaped knife.There was    
 another knife shaped like a thumb.When
 the man had cut some glove shapes he  
 put them into packages of dozens for  
 the ladies to make them into gloves.We
 saw some ladies making gloves.They    
 were fixing cuffs,sewing them up and  
 ironing the gloves.To iron a glove    
 they put it on a hot metal hand for a 
 few seconds,then take it off and press
 it under a heavy metal block.All the  
 gloves have to be examined.If somebody
 has not sewn a glove up properly the  
 lady will put a pin where it is not   
 sewn up and she will give it to       
 someone to put right.Some ladies      
 packed the gloves into bags.At the end
 we saw a man packing the finished     
 gloves into a big box.
