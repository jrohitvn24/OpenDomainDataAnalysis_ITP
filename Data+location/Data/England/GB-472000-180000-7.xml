		<title>07The Henley Education Charity</title>
		<content>In 1604 only rich people could afford  
to send their sons to school. Dame     
Periam wanted poor boys to have        
education too,so she started a school  
for them. Her money provided a building
and paid the headmasters wages. Now    
that the goverment provides buildings  
and pay teachers, Dame Periam's money  
can be used for other things, like     
books and computers.                   
  Some other people, William Gravett   
and Alex Knapp, also gave money for    
education and all their schools became 
the Henley Grammar school about 1890.  
  There are 11 people on the committee.
They gather six evenings a year to     
split the money up. Mrs. Day wants to  
stay on the committee as long as they  
want her to. Schools and parents of    
individual children can apply for      
grants to help them with outings and   
equipment.                             </content>
