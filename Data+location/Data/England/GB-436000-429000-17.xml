		<content> The mining, at Gamblethorpe and Astley
 causes noise, dust and vibrations in  
 nearby houses due to blasting. There  
 has also been a growth in the number  
 of heavy lorries on local roads. Once 
 coal extraction is complete the land  
 on one site will be restored to       
 provide leisure park with lakes, a    
 nature reserve and other facilities   
 for the public to enjoy. The other    
 site is to be used for the disposal of
 refuse. There is a children's play-   
 ground adjacent to the Miners Welfare 
 ground with swings, slides, etc.      
 unfortunately these are often being   
 vandalised. Children living on the    
 north side of the busy main road do   
 not have a play area of their own due 
 to the lack of a suitable site.However
 it is hoped to build a B.M.X.track in 
 the  near future for local school     
 children and teenagers.               </content>
