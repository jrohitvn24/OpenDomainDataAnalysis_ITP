		<title>05THE PARISH CHURCH, AMBLECOTE</title>
		<content>    Just off the busy High Street in   
 two acres of grounds can be found the 
{Holy Trinity Church of Amblecote,     
 surrounded by iron railings that      
 somehow survived the second world war.
    Before the building of this church,
 the local parish church was{St.Mary's 
{Oldswinford.}From Brettell Lane this  
 was almost a two mile walk. Due to the
 population increase in{Amblecote}as a 
 result of the developing industries of
 glass and steel, the need for the     
 area's own parish church grew.        
    Built in 1842 from locally produced
 clay bricks, the exterior remains the 
 same today as then, with clocktower,  
 eight bells and Lych Gate dating back 
 to 1921. The interior has features    
 showing work of craftsmen in wood and 
 stained glass. Pews were removed in   
 1900, chairs and choir stalls being   
 put in.                               </content>
