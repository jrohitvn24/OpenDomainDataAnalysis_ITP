		<title>18WELLS AND WATER</title>
		<content> The area at the top of Rainow Road is 
 hilly and begins to open out on to    
 more open country. Set back from the  
 main road, going downhill, is Well    
 Lane,so called because of the wells   
 which abound. Not all are visible, one
 is in a private garden,another is in a
 field along a rough track with a      
 natural spring bubbling nearby, while 
 at the entrance to Lower Fold Farm a  
 boulder backed by flowers covers a    
 well to protect pedestrians and cars. 
 There is no shortage of water in this 
 district.By contrast, at the bottom of
 the same road a small industrial      
 estate is being developed. New        
 buildings spread into open            
 farmland,while an old mill now        
 provides a Tyre Fitting and Repair    
 service for private and industrial    
 vehicles.Between these extremes stands
 Hurdsfield Church.                    </content>
