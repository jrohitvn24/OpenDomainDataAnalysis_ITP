		<title>19STATISTICS OF THE SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Children in their first and final  
 years were questioned about school    
 life. In the first school all children
 except 2 looked forward to school,    
 (these 2 had not attended playschool).
 All the children enjoyed school,      
 particularly the number and language  
 games. The children are taught in     
 groups of ability. A television with  
 video-recorder is used to stimulate   
 discussion and provides a basis for   
 work programmes. Most children had    
 started a reading book, 10 play a     
 musical instrument and 4 can swim.    
   The two classes in the final year   
 are taught by five different teachers 
 still in their class groups. Pupils   
 develop definite 'subject choices'.   
 These pupils do not watch television. 
 They are all able to swim, and only   
 four are still learning a musical     
 instrument.                           </content>
