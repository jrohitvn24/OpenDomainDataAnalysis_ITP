		<title>16The Jumbulance, Harpenden</title>
		<content> The Jumbulance is a 24 ton articulated
 coach, specially fitted with 18       
 stretcher-beds, it carries emergency  
 medical equipment &amp; a hydraulic lift. 
 Nurse Salvesen, who works in a        
 Harpenden surgery, set up the local   
 branch.  She told us how, each        
 year since 1981, they have taken up to
 18 severely ill patients abroad on    
 holiday, this year they go to Italy.  
 The 60' coach has a kitchen in the    
 central concertina section.  The 26   
 voluntary helpers include a doctor, 4 
 nurses, a priest and 2 drivers.       
 Wheel chairs are carried beneath the  
 coach.   Each person is allowed 2     
 suitcases.   Funds raised pay for the 
 patients' holidays but the helpers pay
 (Â£325) for themselves. The coach is so
 large that once, in an emergency, they
 had to pay Â£25 for a mini-ambulance   
 just to get a patient into hospital.  </content>
