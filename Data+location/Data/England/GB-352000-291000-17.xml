		<title>17THE YOUNG FARMERS CLUB</title>
		<content> I have been a member of the Rushbury  
 &amp; Cardington Young Farmers{club}for 13
 years,and during that time I have done
 various activities.These range from   
 cookery contests to playing hockey for
 the Shropshire Federation "B"team.In  
 addition I have also helped to repair 
 and repaint the club room and cut the 
 grass in the local church-yard.The    
 style of the club has changed since it
 first started,but the aim is still the
 same,to have fun.There are many       
 offices and posts to be held in the   
 club,and these help young people      
 become more self-confident nnd assist 
 them to meet and overcome new         
{challenges.}The posts include chairman
 secretary and their assistants,sports 
 officers,social secretary and stock   
 judging officer. We try to promote the
 Young Farmers movement and create     
 comradeship in a rural community.     </content>
