		<title>19MAGPIE GEESE IN REDDITCH</title>
		<content> The{Magpie Goose}(Anseranas           
 semipalmata) is a fascinating bird    
 because nobody is quite sure whether  
 it is a swan,a goose,a duck or if it  
 is another family of birds all on its 
 own.                                  
{Magpie Geese}are common in Australia. 
 They are rare in Britain.However,there
 are some at Callow Hill Village, on a 
 small pond along with some other      
 water-fowl.Its feet are only partly   
 webbed so it does not fit precisely   
 into any group of water-fowl.It has a 
 large knob on the forehead and        
 abnormally long legs.Its plumage is   
 black and white,black on the head,    
 neck,wings and tail,and white on the  
 rest of the body.Its beak is red and  
 black,and its black feathers shine    
 green and blue like a Magpie's,which  
 is probably why it is called a {Magpie
{Goose.}                               </content>
