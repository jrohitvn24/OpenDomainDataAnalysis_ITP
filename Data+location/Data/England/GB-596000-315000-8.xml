 The Norfolk Rural Life Museum ,       
 Gressenhall, was opened in 1976 in    
 Beech House, a large building         
 originally used as a workhouse and    
 subsequently as an old people's home. 
 It houses rural collections from the  
 whole county. The main display hall   
 deals with the history of agriculture 
 in Norfolk. There are also displays on
 dairying,ironfoundery,education,shoe  
 making and other rural industries.    
 A "Craftmen's Row"in the out buildings
 includes reconstructions of workshops 
 of a saddler,blacksmith, baker,       
 basket maker and a wheelwright. Other 
 exhibits include Cherry Tree Cottage- 
 a typical Norfolk home c.1900 and a   
 reconstructed village grocers shop.   
 A c.1900 farm is being established    
 adjacent to the museum.
