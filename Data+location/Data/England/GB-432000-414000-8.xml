		<title>08The Country Park Warden</title>
		<content>   The person with probably the most   
 interesting job in our area is Gordon 
 Lunn, usually known as 'Gordon the    
 Warden'. We met him early on a morning
 so that we could ask him about the    
 Newmillerdam Country Park which he is 
 in charge of.                         
   He explained that he was brought up 
 in the area and used to go poaching in
 the area that is now covered by the   
 Park. When he left school he joined   
 the army and travelled around the     
 world for over twenty years before    
 returning to Newmillerdam seven years 
 ago to become Warden.                 
   The Warden's job is to manage and   
 care for an important area of         
 relaxation for the people of          
 Wakefield.The woodlands must be       
 protected since as the number of      
 visitors increases so does the damage 
 a few thoughtless ones may cause.     </content>
