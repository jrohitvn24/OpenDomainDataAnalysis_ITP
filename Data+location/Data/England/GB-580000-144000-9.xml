		<content> Within the village there is a{nursery 
{school and a play school}for children 
 under five. Both attempt to prepare   
 children for entry to the{village     
{Primary School}where they stay until  
 they are eleven. A small number of    
 children attend{private schools       
 elsewhere and either board or travel  
 daily. Children who live more than 3  
 miles from the Primary School travel  
 by taxi. At the age of 11 all children
 travel,usually by School Bus,to{High  
{Schools}at Lenham,Maidstone or perhaps
 Tenterden. They leave these schools at
 16. At 13 some of the more academic   
 pupils will have transferred to an    
{Upper School}in Maidstone to prepare  
 for public examinations such as G.C.E.
 "O" or "A" Level. Many then go to     
{University}or to{Colleges of Further  
{Education.}There are also{courses}in  
 Maidstone to train unemployed youths. </content>
