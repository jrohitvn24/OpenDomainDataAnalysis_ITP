 Hogg.                                 
 Iam Gawsworth Rose Queen 1985/1986.   
 I had a lovely dress made by Mrs      
 Rouse and my mum,it was made of white 
 satin and had a large lace frill at   
 the front.On June 8th (Fete Day)I went
 to the Hairdressers and had my hair   
 done.2:00pm My princesses,Carolyn     
 Farrish and Carol Twigg and I         
 assembled at the Parish Hall,         
      We got on a decorated van and    
 drove to school.We stopped at the gate
 and walked across the playground and  
 on to the stage.Joanna Hart last years
 queen crowned me and then I gave my   
 speech and everyone clapped.I led off 
 the stage and went to have tea with   
 the other Rose Queens in the hall.I   
 got a free catcus off Mrs Pratt.I got 
 a necklace as a present from the      
 P.T.A. and it had a rose on the end. _</content>
