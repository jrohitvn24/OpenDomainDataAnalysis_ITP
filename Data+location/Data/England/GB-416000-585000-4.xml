		<title>04LANCASTER PARK, NEWGATE ST.</title>
		<content>   Built 1970-80 on Matheson's Gardens,
{LANCASTER PARK}consists mainly of     
 detached houses.Many of the original  
 trees and hedges have been preserved  
 and there are many open spaces but no 
 other amenities except the First      
 School.From the estate a footpath     
 leads through Davis Wood along Scots' 
 Ghyll to the{Wansbeck}and{Mitford Rd.}
 The road joins Pottery Bank and passes
 through{Bullers Green}to{Newgate St.,}
 first recorded in 1361.Here 18th and  
 19th century houses,many now converted
 to shops, and old coaching inns blend 
 happily with a new award-winning      
 housing scheme.From the street open   
 many delightful courts, closes and    
 yards; an archway leads to the{       
{Bakehouse Steps,}the last of seven    
 sets of stepping stones across the    
 Wansbeck.Access to{Back Riggs}shops is
 via{Manchester St.}and{Copper Chare.} </content>
