		<title>14Flora at Durlston</title>
		<content>      Much of the flora of our study   
 area is typical of chalkland scenery. 
      There are over 400 different     
 species of wild flowers - speedwell,  
 scarlet pimpernel, yellow rattle, ox  
 eye daisy, charlock, dog rose and     
 cranesbill being amongst the most     
 common. Apart from these there are    
 many different types of orchid, some  
 quite rare such as the pyramidal, bee,
 and early spider orchid. Thrift is    
 abundant on the salty cliffs, and in  
 the early spring cowslips abound in   
 the fields.                           
      Hedgerows of hawthorn, bramble   
 and blackthorn surround fields and    
 cover old quarry spoil heaps.Ivy      
 clings to many of the stone walls and 
 here and there clumps of nettles and  
 docks cover areas of thin soil.Trees  
 in the area include oak, ash, beech,  
 sycamore and Scot's pine.             </content>
