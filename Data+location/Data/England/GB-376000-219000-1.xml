		<title>01A CHILD'S LIFE IN HIGHNAM</title>
		<content>    When questioned about summer term  
 activities,the pupils of Highnam      
 Primary school highlighted sucesses at
 netball and for the choir at the      
 Cheltenham Festival.School parties    
 went to Wales,Holland,Belgium and     
 Tibberton for the Domesday project.A  
 gym club display and a sponsored      
 netball match,which itself raised     
 Â£800,were enjoyed by large audiences. 
    The peace and tranquility of       
 Highnam and a friendly community make 
 it appealing to live in.However,former
 town dwellers said they missed the    
 hustle and bustle of the city.In the  
 holidays,Gloucester provides sporting 
 facilities,as do the local playing    
 fields and woods.Yet the school,being 
 the place the children most frequently
 go to,remains at the centre of their  
 village life.                         
                                       </content>
