		<title>01Ravendale, the general area</title>
		<content> Our block is made up of four villages 
 in a very rural setting. The area is  
 quite hilly and the land is devoted to
 farming, mainly arable farming, but   
 with a small percentage of dairy and  
 beef cattle. The villages are Beelsby,
 Hatcliffe, East and West Ravendale.   
 The community is partially composed of
 farmers and farm workers but the      
 villages today are mainly dormitory   
 villages for Grimsby, the nearby town 
 and the Humber Bank Industries. The   
 Ravendale Valley is a local beauty    
 spot used as a picnic area in the     
 summer and for toboganning in the     
 winter.
