		<title>02LAKESIDE HOLIDAYS, WOOTTON</title>
		<content>   {Lakeside Holiday Camp}is           
 situated off the main road through    
 Wootton beside the Old Mill Pond.     
  On site is a swimming pool that is   
 also open to the public, tennis       
 courts, childrens play area, bar and  
 discos. Most people camp in their own 
 tents but some stay in chalets. About 
 fifty people are employed catering for
 up to nine hundred visitors. The site 
 is only open in the summer.           
  We spoke to a young couple staying at
 the camp site. They said they came to 
 Lakeside because it had easy access to
 the car ferry and a friend said it was
 a nice area. During the day the family
 leave Wootton and go sight seeing or  
 to the beach but use the facilities in
 the evenings. They had not come to the
 Island before but if they come again  
 they will probably stay at Wootton.
