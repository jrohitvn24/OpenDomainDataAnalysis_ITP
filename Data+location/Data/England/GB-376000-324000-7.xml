		<content> Farming is the main industry. Most of 
 the farms have about 150 acres, and   
 are mixed units,combining arable and  
 cattle and sheep. The main arable     
 crop is barley as there is very       
 little oat growing. Several farms     
 grow their own barley which is then   
 converted into barley-beef.They       
 raise barley-beef intensively,keeping 
 their stock in sheds all the year     
 round. Very few farmers raise potatoes
 which is contrary to the custom ten   
 years ago.                            
 Many farms run their own dairy herds  
 which are usually Friesians. The      
 normal size of herd is 60 milking     
 cows and approximately 30 followers.  
 Some farmers'wives run their own      
 poultry and sell the eggs at the door.
 These are usually free-range but one  
 farm keeps 2,000 battery hens.
