		<title>05Mr&amp;Mrs B. (A Retired Couple)</title>
		<content> Mr B.lived in St Ives until he was 20,
 then he moved to London for the rest  
 of his working life.He joined the RAF 
 in 1939 and in 1952 he joined the     
 retail trade.He now lives in          
 Needingworth enjoying his retirement  
 with his wife.His wife came from      
 London.They both like the village     
 because it makes a change from their  
 life in London,but they think that    
 there should be a village hall.They   
 think that their biggest change has   
 been their retirement,they have time  
 for horticulture and W.I. They are    
 enjoying the present day because of   
 the higher standard of living.However 
 they don't like the hooliganism that  
 is reported.Mrs B. used to go         
 to church but her legs prevent this   
 now.Mr B. does the shopping in the    
 village.He goes by car.
