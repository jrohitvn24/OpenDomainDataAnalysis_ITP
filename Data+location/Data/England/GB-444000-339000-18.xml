 by 10 a.m. Thursday when the fair     
 opens. (South Street, Bath Street,    
 East Street and Pimlico).  Time for   
 dismantling is midnight Saturday until
 12 noon Sunday. Thousands of people   
 visit the fair each year and coach    
 parties also come from neighbouring   
 towns.  Fair fever is evident amongst 
 the children of Ilkeston and causes   
 great excitement.  Youngsters flock to
 see the fair being erected.  Some work
 on the stalls.                        </content>
