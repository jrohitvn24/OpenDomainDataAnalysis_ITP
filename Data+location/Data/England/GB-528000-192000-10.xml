 The most important house in the area, 
 Broomfield House, which was shown on  
 the earliest maps of the parish was   
 destroyed by fire last year.  Much of 
 the museum was rescued and also the   
 Lanscroon Murals on the staircase but 
 it is not yet certain whether the     
 house can be restored.                
 Cannon House, next to our school, is  
 about 200 years old and is now used as
 a social club.  One room has a strange
 fireplace with a window above it so   
 the smoke had to run round the sides. 
 The Hermitage, nearby, is the only    
 thatched house left, and is near the  
 corner of the park which is called the
 Village Gates because originally large
 gates stood there.
