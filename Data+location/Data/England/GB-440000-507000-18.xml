		<content> Kirklevington is a village of trees.  
 An old hall and a manor house once    
 stood in Kirklevington. These were    
 surrounded by extensive grounds and   
 woods. Many of these old trees remain 
 although new houses stand in the old  
 hall and manor grounds. The top soil  
 in the 'D' block is boulder clay.The  
 sub soil is keuper marl which is good 
 for growing trees. The                
 ash,hawthorn,birch are some of the    
 common trees found.In Ash Grove       
 the council have protected 64         
 trees.They are all numbered.          
 Some roads are named after trees :-   
{Birch Close, Ash Grove, Forest Lane,  
 and{Grove Bank.                       
 Many  elm trees are being felled      
 because of Dutch Elm Disease. A new   
 resistant strain has been found but   
 none are planted as yet in            
 Kirklevington.                        </content>
