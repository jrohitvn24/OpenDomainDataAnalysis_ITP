		<content> Because there is only a fortnightly   
 bus service to the local market town  
 of Halesworth, the majority of homes  
 have at least 1 car, several 2. and a 
 few a derelict vehicle as well. There 
 are about 6 motor or motorized cycles 
 and most households harbour at least 1
 bicycle. A single pony &amp; trap makes   
 regular pleasure trips, but of the 30 
 or so horses none is used solely for  
 transport. Tractors are               
 used,particularly in the snow. In term
 time coaches take pupils daily to     
 their primary, middle and high        
 schools.                              
 Apart from these the most frequent    
 heavy vehicles are milk, cattle , pig 
 &amp; corn lorries servicing the farms.   
 Indee, the only vehicles on the road  
 are those which have a business or    
 social interest in the village as the 
 unclassified road leads nowhere.      </content>
