		<title>08MYLOR CHURCH</title>
		<content>   It was founded over 1500 years ago  
 in 411 A.D. by St.Mylor, who like     
 other cornish saints of the Celtic    
 church, is linked with Brittany.      
 Services are held on Wednesdays, and  
 twice on Sundays at 8.00 and 10.30 am.
 St.Peters Church (Flushing)and All    
 Saints (Mylor)also belong to the      
 parish.                               
   Mylor still worships traditional    
 events eg.candlemass, whilst most     
 other churches do not.Marriges and    
 Christenings also take place there.   
 The churchyard cross is the tallest   
 old granite cross in Cornwall.It is 17
 ft. 6 inches tall, and stood in       
 prehistoric times for pagan worship   
 and was later christianised.St.Mylor  
 is supposedly buried beneath it.
