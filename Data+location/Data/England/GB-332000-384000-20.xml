		<title>20WORK &amp; LEISURE IN ROCK FERRY</title>
		<content> The area is served by one{Sports      
{hall/Swimming Pool}which was built in 
 1933.  This is used by schools during 
 the day but is open to clubs during   
 the evenings and holiday times.  A    
 wide range of activities are offered  
 and well used.  There is the{Viking   
{Boys Club}opposite the school and an  
 adventure play area.  There is one    
{Roman Catholic,}one{Baptist}and one   
{Anglican Church}in the area.  There   
 does not seem to be any{ethnic problem
 in the community.  The{Chinese,}who   
 run the{take-away food shops,}have    
 their own way of life and language but
 the children are well accepted at     
 school.  Those who are fortunate      
 enough to have a job tend to work     
 outside the area or have part-time    
 jobs.  Rock Ferry is a typical area   
 suffering from urban decay with a     
 degree of crime and drabness.         </content>
