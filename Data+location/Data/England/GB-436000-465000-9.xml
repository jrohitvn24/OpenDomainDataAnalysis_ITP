		<title>09THE DEVILS ARROWS</title>
		<content> At one time there were 4 arrows, but  
 the bridge was in need of repair, so  
 they used one of the arrows to repair 
 the bridge.There is a special mark on 
 the bridge its like a little arrow    
 with a stick on the top so if you go  
 to a certain part of the bridge you   
 will see this picture. the legend goes
 like this: The devil in attempt to    
 destroy Aldborough said               
 "Borobrigg, keep o'way,               
  For Aldborough town                  
  I will ding down!"                   
 Now a days people say that he stood on
 a hill and threw an arrow which split 
 into 4 pieces and they landed near    
 Boroughbridge. When you go to see the 
 arrows you will see why they are      
 called the Three Devils Arrows.       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
