		<content> Beyond Sarratt village there are no   
 other significant settlements.The area
 is largely agricultural or woodland.  
 To the east of the area lies Langley- 
 bury School and Home Farm.Whippendell 
 Wood is a popular spot for local      
 people.Extensive changes to the       
 farmscape have occurred recently due  
 to the building of the M25.Certain    
 roads have been re-routed and large-  
 scale excavations have been necessary.
  It is an area of grassland and arable
 crops,with scattered woods.Clays and  
 gravels,used by the quarrymen,overlie 
 chalk,and the gently rolling landscape
 is cut by several dry valleys adding  
 to the area's appeal for visitors.    
 Visitors are attracted to the district
 to walk along its numerous well-marked
 footpaths,to enjoy the views or to    
 sample one of the several country     
 pubs.                                 </content>
