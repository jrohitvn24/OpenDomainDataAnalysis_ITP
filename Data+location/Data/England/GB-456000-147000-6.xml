		<content> Apart from Breach Farm, Bull's Bushes 
 Farm, Southwood Farm and Oakdown Farm 
 there are only{two areas which are    
{primarily residential.}These are the  
 South Oakley/Pardown area and the new 
 privately owned, estate developments  
 on the western edge of Kempshott.     
                                       
 The{Kempshott houses}are of a         
 conventional brick built construction.
 They are mainly detached and semi-    
 detached with only a few terraced.    
 The present{price of these properties 
 ranges from Â£32,000 to Â£85,000 for the
 larger four bedroomed homes.          
                                       
 Most houses have a{small garden}with a
 patio, and adjacent{garage,}which is  
 occasionally integral. Utility rooms  
 and conservatories have been added to 
 some houses.
