		<content> The community is served by shops in   
 Askrigg and Bainbridge. In Askrigg    
 there is a general store, a           
 newsagents and toursist shop run      
 by the Askrigg Foundation and a Post  
 Office. In Bainbridge, the Post Office
 and General Stores are combined. There
 is also a butcher and one of the      
 garages acts as a newsagent.          
 In addition, travelling shops visit   
 the villages and hamlets from Hawes   
 and a weekly laundry/dry cleaning     
 service is available from Lancaster.  
 Much of the community's general       
 shopping is done in Hawes (4 miles    
 away) and Leyburn (13 miles away) on  
 Market days.                          
 The towns of Richmond, Northallerton, 
 Darlington, Ripon, Lancaster and      
 Kendal are used for larger            
 commodities.
