		<content>  The Somerleaze estate covers         
 approximately l6 acres and the country
 house itself was probably built in the
 middle of the seventeenth century.    
 About twelve years ago the then owner 
 built a new house where the coach     
 house used to be and turned the stable
 wing into flats.                      
  The present owners, who are named    
 Berry, have recently changed the use  
 of the estate by constructing a garden
 centre on part of it. This garden     
 centre, which was opened in l984,     
 sells exclusively to the horticultural
 trade; it does not sell bedding plants
 but specialises in shrubs, bushes,    
 small trees and conifers. The Berry   
 family embarked on this venture as    
 they were already involved in         
 horticulture. They do not run the     
 garden centre themselves but employ a 
 manager.                              </content>
