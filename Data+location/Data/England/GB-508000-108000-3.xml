 There are three working farms in the  
 area, covering 90% of the land.  Crops
 are generally rotated with wheat,     
 barley, and sown grass for grazing.   
 All have store cattle and Myrtlegrove 
 Farm has a dairy herd.   Muntham Farm 
 has 50 acres of woodland and there is 
 pheasant rearing over the whole area. 
 On this downland there is a very thin 
 layer of soil over the chalk, so soil 
 conservation and testing is an        
 important item of management.         
 Field names reflect the history of the
 residents and social life of the area,
 some of the more interesting being    
 Back of Cobden, Cockhill, Giants Cave,
 Tolmare, Ramsdean, Keepers,           
 Greenwicks.                           
 The Gibbet was used for foxes and     
 other vermin, not humans.             </content>
