		<content> Eyam and Stoney Middleton are quiet   
 villages situated in Derbyshire,      
 within the Peak District National Park
 ,just 12 miles from Sheffield.        
 Bakewell,the local market town is 7   
 miles distance.                       
 Eyam has a population of approximately
 1000 whilst Stoney Middleton has      
 around 500.                           
 Eyam is famous for its connection with
 the Great Plague of 1665.             
 Most of the area is given over to     
 grassland or woodland.There are also a
 number of quarries extracting florspar
 or limestone.There was in the past, an
 important lead mining industry.       
 Today employment is varied and many   
 people live in the area but work      
 outside.Unemployment in 1985 is not a 
 serious problem.
