		<title>03Housing in West End, Stoke</title>
		<content>In West End, Stoke, the houses are     
mainly terraced.This is because they   
take up less space and are cheap to    
build.Some houses in Foden Street have 
been knocked down.There is no new      
housing except for some small bungalows
suitable for old people.               
  In Shelburne Street, the terraced    
houses have got a line of tiles in the 
brick work.Each tile has 'Gold Coin' on
it.A man put a bet on a horse called   
Gold Coin.The horse won and with the   
money he built a row of terraced       
houses.                                
  My house is a terraced house.It has  
three bedrooms,two living rooms,a bath 
room and a big kitchen.It has a garden 
with some fruit trees.It also has a    
garage.
