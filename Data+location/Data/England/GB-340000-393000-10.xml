		<title>10Croxteth - A Poem</title>
		<content>     If you remember in 1952           
     (And hundreds of people do)       
     The foundations were laid,        
     And people were paid,             
     And the Croxteth Estate was built.
 Now lots of problems have slowly      
                                arisen,
 Unemployment and drugs galore         
 The foundations were laid,            
 And people were paid,                 
 But Croxteth began to wilt.           
     The once proud houses have been   
                            demolished,
     Some stand naked and bare on the  
                               streets.
     People hang homeless around,      
     Is nobody here aware ?            
 The Croxteth problems are getting     
                                 worse,
 Nothing is quite the same.            
 People are asked where they are from, 
 'Croxteth' is said in shame.   (cont.)</content>
