		<content> Some of the games we play at          
 Selattyn are the same games they play 
 out of our area only they have        
 different names like the game         
 Areoplane,tick or tunnel daber, in the
 Roman Catholic they call it stuck in  
 the mud. Gemma Edwards made up a game 
 called Bananas and any number can play
 it but if there is over eight, two    
 people has to be on, Lets pretend 6   
 people are playing, one person has to 
 be on they choose a good place for    
 their den, and the rest of the people 
 run off, NOT to far though That person
 thats on counts to 10 then comes after
 them. If he catches them he takes a   
 person with him back to his den and   
 puts their hands above their head.    
 Then they cannot get away from        
 the the den.
