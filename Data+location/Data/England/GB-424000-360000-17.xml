		<content> Things I do:                          
 I read a lot of books about planes    
 and make models.                      
 I go to the playing fields on the     
 swings,play snooker at the youth club 
 and climb on the rocks.               
 I go fishing for trout in the River   
 Derwent at Darley Dale.               
 I ride on the BMX track and my sister 
 goes horse riding.                    
 I like to play football on the pitch/ 
 I go to Matlock to learn judo.        
 Sometimes I watch fox hunting when    
 they cross our land.                  
 My dad goes Morris dancing,mumming and
 clog dancing.                         
 I like learning the piano and guitar  
 and we go swimming at Matlock Lido on 
 Saturdays.                            
 West Derbyshire is mainly rural but   
 has major cities on its boundaries    
 with a range of recreations.          </content>
