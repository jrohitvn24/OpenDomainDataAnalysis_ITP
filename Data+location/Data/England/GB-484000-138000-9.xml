 During the summer months a high       
 proportion of people spend their spare
 time gardening;children tend to help  
 or play outdoors with their friends.  
 Country walks are also popular forms  
 of relaxation;there are a lot of dog  
 owners,so these country walks are very
 much for the family as a whole.When   
 the weather is really warm and sunny  
 many people take themselves to the    
 sea-side,picknicking on the beach and 
 visiting the pub on the way home.     
 Alternitavely,in hot weather,many will
 sunbathe in their own gardens and cook
 meals outside on a barbecue.Camping   
 and caravanning are also popular      
 pastimes.                             
 In winter people  watch television    
 (especilly sport).About half the      
 people own video recorders,so are able
 to see favourite programmes at leisure</content>
