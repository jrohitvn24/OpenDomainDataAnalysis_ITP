		<content> The church is on the A361 in the main 
 village.  It was built in 1730 to     
 replace an older, smaller one.  The   
 license was granted by the Bishop of  
 Exeter.  The roof was recently retiled
 at a cost of ten thousand pounds.  The
 tiles came from Bridgewater.  The     
 stained-glass windows are Victorian   
 but at the tower end there are modern 
 windows.  In the tower there are six  
 bells.  There are two bell-ringing    
 teams; one younger and one older, the 
 youngest ringer in the tower being    
 nine years old.  There is a Sunday    
 school, and services at 10.00 a.m.    
 each Sunday. Inside the church there  
 is a bookstall selling religious      
 books.  In the churchyard there is the
 grave of Phillipa Collins who died at 
 the age of 101, a servant of the      
 Fortescue family for over fifty years.
