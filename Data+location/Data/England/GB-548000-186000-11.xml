		<title>11AN OLD PEOPLE'S HOME</title>
		<content> The'Lawns'was built in 1963.It caters 
 for old people whose family cannot    
 look after them.It is paid for by the 
 local authority,with extras paid for  
 by fund _raising events like sponsored
 walks.                                
       There are about 6O permanent    
 residents plus a few day_care         
 people,who live on their own but need 
 special attention with things like    
 bathing.                              
        The residents like the freedom 
 to come and go.They receive visitors  
 whenever they wish and go out as long 
 as the warden knows about this.       
         There are some complaints     
 about the food but generally they feel
 that individual likes and dislikes are
 well catered for.Basket weaving is    
 done by the residents as a            
 therapy,card and board games are      
 played and T.V. is watched.           </content>
