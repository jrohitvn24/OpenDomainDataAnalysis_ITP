		<content>      The sports facilities in our     
 block are very good.There's lots of   
 football pitches, hockey pitches      
 and rugby pitches. There is also an   
 all weather court lit by flood lights.
 There are two large cricket pitches.  
 There is a large sports hall to       
 practice athletics and that is just   
 at Les Quennevais. There is also a    
 cycle track. There is a yachting club 
 and an athletics club which runs all  
 the time. Also at les Quennevais is a 
 jogging club and a boxing club. You   
 can practice your sports and you can  
 join a club at the sports hall. So all
 in all our block has the best sports  
 facilities in Jersey.
