		<content>{  DEEPCAR}township is sited near the  
 confluence of the Rivers Don and      
 Porter ('Carr'=marsh). It has strong  
 links with neighbouring{Stocksbridge  
 (Total pop. approx. 14000) but is     
 still remote from{Sheffield}(8 miles  
 S.E.) although administered by it.    
   Its character has changed from a    
 small agricultural, then industrial,  
 hamlet to an expanding dormitory      
 township for commuters. However some  
 families have lived there for several 
 generations thus retaining a village  
 atmosphere. The advent of a new bypass
 will relieve it of its heavy traffic. 
   The bypass will intrude however into
 the tranquil and historical environ-  
 ment of the small{WHARNCLIFFE}farming 
 community. The farms, woods and Estate
 park-land are close to the old village
 of{Wortley.}This area is under the    
 administration of{Barnsley}(6 ml.N.E.)</content>
