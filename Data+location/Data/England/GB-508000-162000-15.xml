		<content> Friday by Janine Head                 
 I wake up at 6.30 a.m. and read until 
 7.30 a.m. Then I have breakfast and   
 get dressed at 8.00 a.m. Before I     
 leave for school I pack all the things
 I will need i.e. P.E. kit.Then I walk 
 with my sister to school at 8.40 a.m. 
 The whistle for school goes at 8.55   
 a.m. Our teacher takes the register   
 and we go down to assembly. Then we go
 back to class for mathematics until   
 10.35 a.m.Next we have English until  
 11.30, then French until 12.00, when  
 it is lunch time. Lunch is in two     
 sittings. It ends at 1.20 p.m. We have
 games after lunch until 2.30 p.m. then
 drama or music. At 3.30 p.m. we go    
 home. At home I do my homework and go 
 to bed at 9.30.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
