		<title>01Cricklade,9thC Saxon Borough</title>
		<content> Cricklade is a good example of 9th c  
 Saxon 'New town' boroughs on upper    
 reaches of Thames. The layout is      
 largely unchanged. The town centre    
 buildings date from 18th and 19th     
 century and is dominated by fine 16th 
 c Tower of St Sampsonschurch. Outlying
 modern housing estates are homes of a 
 dormitory population which has doubled
 since World War II. About 80% of land 
 in this block is under agriculture.   
 But weekly markets have not been held 
 since 1936. The ancient Common called 
 North Meadow is still common  and     
 forms a part of an extensive          
 floodplain to north of town through   
 which the rivers Thames and Church    
 flow. From early in 1st century       
 until 1975 all traffic along the Roman
 Ermin Street passed through Cricklade 
 and along the causeway,but such       
 traffic is now diverted along a bypass</content>
