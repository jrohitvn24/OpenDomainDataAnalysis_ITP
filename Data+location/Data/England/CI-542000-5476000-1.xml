		<content> This area includes the northern part  
 of the Island of Brecqhou and the     
 north western corner of Sark. The     
 majority of the block, however, is    
 sea.                                  
 This part of Brecqhou is rocky        
 coastline with cliffs allowing no     
 easy access to the sea.               
 Similar features are to be found on   
 the Sark mainland, although the ground
 does level off leading to the main    
 plateau of the island. The cliffs have
 a number of caves in them the most    
 famous of which are the Boutiques     
 Caves where pirate treasures are said 
 to have been stored. Access to        
 these caves and to the sandy bays     
 is possible at low tide.              
 The Window is an artificial opening   
 in a natural rock wall through which  
 goods were hauled up the sheer cliff.
