 houses, dating from 1695. This was    
 originally single storey but is now 2

 have been similarly converted.

 the Church in 1892 - of local stone.  
     There are two renovated cottages  
 dating from 1762. They are named      
 'Quaker Cottages' and were used as a  
 Quaker Meeting House with burial      
 ground. A Wesleyan Chapel has been    
 converted into a private dwelling.    
     The Old People's Home, formerly a 
 village school was built in 1876. In  
 the same year two public houses were  
 built, The Plough &amp; The Station Hotel.
 The former is still open.
