I live in a terraced house in a row,   
the house is brick. When my dad was    
repairing a wall we found a piece of   
stone 50 years old. The roof is made   
out of slate all along the row of      
eight houses. The front garden is      
little, the back garden is about 4     
acres. There are six rooms in the      
house. In the front of the house is a  
pine forest and a meadow. There are no 
houses or shops for 2 miles. When we   
go to the shops we have to go in our   
Land Rover.
