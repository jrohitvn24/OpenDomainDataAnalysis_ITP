		<title>13WEST THURROCK PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>     The present West Thurrock Primary 
 School,built in 1975,is on the site of
 the original school that was opened on
 July 4th.1879.                        
     It is an "open plan"building      
 providing education for children from 
 the age of four years to eleven       
 years.The four year old children are  
 housed in a purpose built nursery     
 class.                                
     The classes are vertically        
 grouped,which means that children from
 two year groups operate in the same   
 class,with teachers in "teams"of two  
 working in open plan areas.there are  
 195 children on roll.                 
     The school building plays an      
 important part in the community.As    
 well as the school,the site includes a
 youth centre,an old people's complex  
 and the nursery.
