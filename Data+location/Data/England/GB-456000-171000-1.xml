		<content> The area's character has developed as 
 a result of the significant{chalk     
{hills}which dominate the landscape and
 have provided house and road builders 
 with significant challenges. The main 
 road passing well to the north of this
 area has helped preserve the tranquil 
 atmosphere encountered here. A        
 predominantly agricltural community   
 has an interesting number of          
 professional people living amongst it,
 with the{parish church}and its fringe 
 activities keeping the{community      
 together. The lack of services and    
 amenities is made up by for by the    
 very close ties within the community  
 and there are enough local jobs for   
 those who need them
