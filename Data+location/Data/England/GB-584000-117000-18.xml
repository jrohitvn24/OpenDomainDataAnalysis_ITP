		<content> Some of the farmhouses are Listed     
 Grade II buildings of historic        
 interest.  Most farmhouses were built 
 in timber_framing in oak which was    
 plentiful in the area.  Wall panels   
 were filled with wattle and daub,     
 later covered with timber weather_    
 boarding or tile_hanging when these   
 became readily available.  Roofs were 
 normally thatched originally but this 
 later gave way to clay tiles which had
 the advantage of being fireproof.     
 Windows were originally unglazed,     
 later with wood sliding or hinged     
 casements, and later still with wood  
 sliding sashes and iron casement.     
 Several old houses have interesting   
 'Dry_ways' running down to the old    
 sea_shore. They have high banks and   
 are partly sunken, giving great       
 privacy.  They were probably used by  
 smugglers in days gone by.            </content>
