		<title>19A Day in My Life (Part 2)</title>
		<content>     When we get home I always do my   
homework outside, unless its raining,  
because it makes me feel happy and     
alert. When I have finished my home-   
work I usually listen to some of my pop
records. At about 7 o'clock my sister  
and I go for a walk over the fields    
where there are some horses. We often  
feed and stroke them. When we go back  
we usually have to have our tea. When  
I have finished I just walk around our 
garden and think how lovely the trees  
and birds and flowers are.             
     Later on, all the family goes for 
a walk by the River Stour and through  
the country lanes. How I love to go for
walks and listen to the insects buzzing
and the trees shaking in the wind.     
     When we get home I watch TV and   
mom makes us all a drink. At about 10  
o'clock I go to bed and dream about    
this beautiful place where I live.     </content>
