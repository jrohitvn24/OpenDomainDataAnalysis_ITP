		<content> The Church of{St.Michael and All      
{Angels}at Great Witley is well known  
 as the finest example of an Italianate
{baroque church}in this country.       
 The rather plain Georgian church of   
{1735}was transformed into its present 
 magnificance by the second{Baron      
{Foley}when,in 1747 he acquired the    
 windows,paintings and other fittings  
 from the chapel of the great house at 
{Canons,}Little Stanmore near Edgeware,
 Middlesex.The beautiful ceiling       
 paintings are the work of{Antonio     
{Bellucci}The white marble font showing
 three angels in marble with an oak    
 cover surmounted by a carving of St.  
 John the Baptist,is the work of{James 
{Forsyth,}and the mosaic reredos given 
 by Rachel,Countess of Dudley is the   
 work of{Salviati of Venice.}The South 
 transept is dominated by{Rysbrach's   
 monument to the 1st Lord &amp; Lady Foley.</content>
