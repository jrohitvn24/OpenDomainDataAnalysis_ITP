		<title>09AN OLD RESIDENT OF SHROTON</title>
		<content>    WE SPOKE TO A MAN WHO LIVES IN A   
 COTTAGE BY THE POST OFFICE. HE IS NOW 
 OVER 80 AND HAS LIVED IN SHROTON ALL  
 HIS LIFE. HE CAN BE SEEN MOST DAYS    
 SITTING ON THE BENCH OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE
 OR CYCLING ROUND THE VILLAGE. HE LOVES
 TO TALK ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND REMEMBERS 
 PLAYING IN THE FIELDS OR IN THE BARNS 
 WHEN IT RAINED. MARBLES WAS HIS       
 FAVOURITE WET DAY GAME. HE HAD TO WALK
 EVERYWHERE AND WAS TOLD BY HIS MOTHER 
 TO KEEP OFF THE ROADS AND ON THE      
 FOOTPATHS TO SAVE HIS HOBNAILED BOOTS.
 HE ATTENDED THE VILLAGE SCHOOL AND    
 THINKS THE VILLAGE LOST MUCH OF ITS   
 LIFE WHEN THE SCHOOL CLOSED. HE BECAME
 A FARMWORKER BUT HAS NOW RETIRED. HE  
 IS STILL A BELLRINGER AT THE CHURCH   
 BUT HE IS VERY SAD THAT THE CHILDREN  
 DO NOT COME TO CHURCH AS THEY DID WHEN
 HE WAS YOUNG.                         
                                       </content>
