		<title>10Housing in Solihull</title>
		<content>   In recent years{Solihull}has became 
 a popular place to live. Therefore a  
 great deal of land has been developed 
 for{housing.}Certain parts of Solihull
 come under the higher income bracket, 
 while at the same time there are      
 several{council estates.}One or two   
 traditional houses remain but most of 
 the area is made up of fairly modern  
 settlements such as Cheswick Green,   
 Cranmore and the Widney/Monkspath     
{development.}All of these main        
 housing areas were built within 15    
 years of each other;Cranmore is the   
 oldest and Widney/Monkspath,the       
 youngest,is still being developed.    
     We talked to agents at some of the
 new show homes and found most people  
 want traditionally built houses rather
 than timber framed. Ensuite and       
 downstairs cloakrooms are very        
 popular.                              </content>
