		<title>17ARTS + CRAFTS IN SHALBOURNE</title>
		<content> There are several{amateur artists}in  
 the village who use oils, water       
 colours or pastels and who exhibit and
 sometimes sell their work. There is   
 also a{potter,}a{sculptress}and a{wood
{carver.}Many people use their skills  
 and spare time to knit, crochet,      
 embroider, make soft toys and         
 dressmake; many of these articles are 
 given to the numerous charity bazaars 
 held in the village. In the winter two
 adult education classes are held in   
 the village hall: a mixed media       
 painting class and a chair caning and 
 upholstery class.  From time to time, 
 other demonstrations in such things as
 cooking, cake icing, flower arranging 
 etc take place in the village hall at 
 the monthly Women's Institute         
 gatherings. A talented{amateur        
{violinist}has a house here and gives  
 occasional concerts.                  </content>
