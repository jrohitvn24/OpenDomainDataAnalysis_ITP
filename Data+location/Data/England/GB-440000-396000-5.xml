		<title>05Children's playground games</title>
		<content>     A modern game is{'Knee-high'}in   
 which players take turns to kick a    
 ball against a wall. A person is 'out'
 if he misses the ball or if it touches
 him above the knee.                   
     In{'British Bulldog'}a person in  
 the middle of the playground is 'on'. 
 He chooses a person who then has to   
 cross the playground without being    
 caught. If he is caught that person   
 becomes 'on'.                         
     To play{'Dicky Levo'}one team     
 hides while another counts and then   
 tries to find the 'hiding' team. When 
 someone is found the finder shouts,   
 "Dicky Levo! One, two, three!" The    
 'hiding' team then has to try and free
 the person caught by 'tigging' or     
 touching them without being caught    
 themselves. When all the team is      
 caught the sides swap over and the    
 game begins again.                    </content>
