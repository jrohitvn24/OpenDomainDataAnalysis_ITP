  A survey was done of the work done by
 mothers and fathers of children in    
 Classes 1 and 2 at Beaupre Community  
 Primary School, Outwell. Sixty        
 children took part in the survey, aged
 8-11 years. The survey took place on  
 June 4th 1985. Each child was allowed 
 two votes, one for their mother and   
 one for their father. It was          
 discovered that 33 fathers work       
 exclusively outside the village whilst
 12 work in the village itself. 19     
 mothers were in paid employment in the
 village whilst 30 mothers were        
 classified as 'housewives'. 14 mothers
 and fathers were in paid employment   
 both in and out of the village. It was
 also found that many mothers and      
 fathers did seasonal work such as     
 strawberry picking and carrot topping 
 on a casual basis.                    </content>
