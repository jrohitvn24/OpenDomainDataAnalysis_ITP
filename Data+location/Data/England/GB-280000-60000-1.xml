		<content> Berry Pomeroy is a small village about
 two miles from Totnes. Most of the    
 village is owned by the Duke of       
 Somerset, who has a home near Berry   
 Pomeroy Castle, his ancestral home. He
 also has a home at Milton Bradley,    
 Wiltshire.                            
 The Duke and Duchess have a young son 
 called Sebastian and one day he will  
 be the Duke of Somerset.              
 The Duke of Somerset's agent lives    
 in the Manor House in the village.    
 This house is believed to have been   
 built on  the foundations of the      
 Norman Manor House where Ralf de      
 Pomerai once lived. Ralf was the first
 Norman Lord of the Manor.
