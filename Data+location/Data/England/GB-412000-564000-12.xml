		<title>12RYTON PARK.</title>
		<content>    The park is very clean and tidy. It
 has pretty flowers all around it and  
 nice green grass. There is a bridge   
 with a little{waterfall}and a field to
 play{football}on. At the bottom of the
 park there are{swings, a slide and a  
{roundabout.}The park also has a{tennis
{court}and a{bowling green.            
    There are different coloured       
{budgies}in a big cage. Next to the    
 cage is a shop that sells sweets, ice 
 cream and drinks.                     
    There is an open air{swimming pool 
 and a{paddling pool.                  
    I go to the park about three or    
 four times a month. Nearly everyone   
 goes there when it is hot. You can    
 have picnics there in Summer.         
    People come from Newcastle, and    
 sometimes even futher away, to visit  
 our park in the Summer.
