		<content>     Stone quarrying was a very        
 important industry during the growth  
 of textiles, the local sandstone being
 excellent for building the mills and  
 houses.                               
    Most of the quarries are now       
 disused, except for Johnsons Quarry at
 Crosland Hill, which employs 120 men. 
 Large quantities of sand and aggregate
 are produced for the building industry
 by a large stone crushing plant.      
    The larger pieces of York          
 sandstone,some weighing 40 tonnes are 
 sawn into smaller slabs and pieces for
 building orders.                      
    Huge saws with diamond tipped      
 blades are used for trimming and      
 shaping the stone. It is possible to  
 make pieces of almost any shape on the
 machines in the stone- masons sheds.  
    The stone from this quarry is      
 popular with builders and architects. </content>
