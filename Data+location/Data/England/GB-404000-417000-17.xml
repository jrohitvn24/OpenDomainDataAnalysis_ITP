		<content>   Some of the fabric is exported to   
 Denmark and much of the rest is bought
 by caravan companies.                 
{T.P.T.}                               
   T.P.T. is a paper mill.They recycle 
 waste paper and make the cardboard    
 that is used to make paper tubes.     
    They employ around 160 local       
 people.They use a shift system and    
 work the mill 24 hours a day,seven    
 days a week.Each shift consists of 40 
 men.                                  
     T.P.T.stands for Textile Paper    
 Tubes, but the tubes are not made at  
 Stainland, they are made in           
 Lancashire.Lorries arrive throughout  
 the day loaded with bales of waste    
 paper.Each bale weighs 3/4 of a tonne,
 and each lorry carries around 20      
 tonnes.                               
       The waste paper is put into a   
 large vat and made into pulp.         </content>
