		<title>07Shepley Stone.</title>
		<content> On the southern outskirts of Shepley  
 there still survives a local industry,
 quarrying; some disused but one still 
 working.  These are the home of       
 Shepley Stone. The natural colour is a
 mixture of brown and blue. Where there
 is a predominence of blue then the    
 stone is more expensive. The more     
 common coloured stone is used for     
 building and is suitable for steps,   
 jambs, wallstone etc. as the crushing 
 strain is 686 tons per square foot.   
 Local buildings built of Shepley stone
 include Holme Moss Television Station,
 the steps to Blackburn Public Hall,   
 Cliffe House and many schools. In     
 London it has been used as paving     
 stones for Trafalgar Square and for   
 parade grounds in Buckingham Palace   
 grounds. It has even been used as     
 pickling tanks for chemical works and 
 for gravestones in London cemeteries. </content>
