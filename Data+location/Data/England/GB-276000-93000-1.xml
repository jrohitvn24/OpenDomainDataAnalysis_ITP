 In 1086 Cheriton Bishop appeared as   
 "CERITONA", possibly from CYRIG-Church
 and TON-Farm. In the 13th Century     
 "Bishop" was added. Medland Manor was 
 also mentioned in Domesday Book. It is
 one of the few parishes in England    
 still retaining unchanged its Saxon   
 boundaries. The Parish Church has a   
 Norman font in wheatsheaf style, the  
 chancel dates from the 13th Century.  
 The nave and tower are 15th Century   
 and there is a ring of 6 bells. Part  
 of the medieval rood screen, with its 
 original paintings remains. The north 
 aisle pews are also 15th Century. A   
 rare painted achievement of Elizabeth 
 1st Royal Arms hangs over the south   
 door.
