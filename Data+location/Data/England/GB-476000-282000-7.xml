		<title>07Exploring Old Houses</title>
		<content>We went round Braybrooke looking for   
houses that might have been built      
before 1800.We only found 4.We went    
down the lane and found a very old     
house.The corners of the house were    
made of stone and the rest was made of 
brick,it would have belonged to someone
quite wealthy in 1800.Next we went to a
one-roomed sort of house built in 1777,
it was near the pub.It only had 1 room 
which was downstairs.It was very small.
We went to Laura's house,it was 3      
cottages before but now made into 1.It 
had 3 chimneys,the window panes had    
criss-crosses.We looked at a newly     
thatched house,it was probably thatched
in 1777 then tiled and thatched again. 
We did all this to find out what the   
houses would probably have been like in
1777.
