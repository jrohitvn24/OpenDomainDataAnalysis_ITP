		<title>14My Dad's Job - a Fisherman</title>
		<content> Winter                                
    My dad is a fisherman. In the      
 winter he goes trawling to catch      
 sprats. He has three boats and takes  
 them 3-5 miles out. They are called   
 Che Sara, Two Sisters and Girl Alison.
 It's fun when I go out and help him   
 but it is hard work.                  
 Summer                                
    In the summer he goes crabbing and 
 netting but the boats go pleasure     
 boating. This year my Dad has tried   
 something new. He has gone seine      
 netting up the river. I help him pull 
 in the net which is hard because you  
 have to battle against the tide. It is
 always calm up the river though. I    
 have to row the boat sometimes and    
 this is hard work too.
