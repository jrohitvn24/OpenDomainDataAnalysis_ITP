  In the afternoon we had a United     
 Rogation Sunday Service which started 
 off at the Lych Gates.There were 22   
 adults and 3 children.The vicar,Mr.   
 Urquhart,and the Methodist Minister,  
 Mr.Brant,led the service.We began with
 the Lord's Prayer and the hymn"All    
 things bright.."Then we walked up to  
 High Well at the top of Humphreygate  
 where we sang"We plough the fields.." 
 It was very windy up there but no one 
 minded.They blessed the crops.Mr.Brant
 read a lesson and preached the sermon.
 After that we sang"When I needed a    
 neighbour.." Mr.Hawley said that many 
 years ago people got their drinking   
 water from High Well.Back at the Lych 
 Gates,we said another prayer and sang 
 another harvest hymn.The vicar gave   
 the blessing and then we all went     
 home.                                 </content>
