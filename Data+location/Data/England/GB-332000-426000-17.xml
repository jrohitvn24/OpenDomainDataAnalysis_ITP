		<title>17St Annes - Employment Survey</title>
		<content>     A selection of local people were  
 interviewed in order to assess the    
 employment advantages of a local      
 commercial area.Many of the people    
 were self_employed or worked in fairly
 small business concerns.All were over 
 21.Because of the local nature of the 
 survey area,some travelled to work on 
 foot or cycle,although many still by  
 car.Normal commercial hours were main_
 tained,9 AM to 5.30 PM,although some  
 to 7 PM.Others worked part_time.Many  
 considered the level of pay to be the 
 major disadvantage of their chosen    
 occupation.General comments were very 
 favourable,with many citing the       
 pleasant local area and high standard 
 of the immediate working conditions as
 substantial advantages.The suburban   
 nature of the shopping area clearly   
 meant that people felt themselves to  
 be an important part of the community.</content>
