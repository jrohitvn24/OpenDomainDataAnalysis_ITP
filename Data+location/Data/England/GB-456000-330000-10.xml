		<title>10ST PETER'S CHURCH RUDDINGTON</title>
		<content> We went to the church and {Mr. Adams} 
 let us in and we went up the twisty   
 stairs.At the top was a small door to 
 the bell tower.In the dusty room were 
 bars going across the enormous        
 bells.We could ring the bells by      
 tapping them. We then went down to the
 rope room.                            
 There are eight bells and a group of  
 teenagers ring them for Sunday        
 services and weddings.{Mr.Adams} is   
 the captain of the belfry and he has  
 been ringing for forty years.         
 Some of the bells were first hung in  
 the {Flawforth} Church in the         
 17th.century.The bells were recst in  
 1969 but the original inscriptions    
 were retained.                        
{    "CELORUM ISTE PLACEAT TIBI

{    "May this sound pleasing to thee, 
{         O King of Heaven" }          </content>
