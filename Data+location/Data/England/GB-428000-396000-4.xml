		<content>{POLLUTION:}The{rivers}have long been  
 affected by the heavy industry but the
 standards are rapidly improving. The  
 presence of kingfishers is evidence of
 this. Domestic water has been         
 discoloured from peat in Langsett     
 Reservoir but new filter plant is     
 opening soon. Heavy traffic on the    
{roads}causes atmospheric pollution    
 with fumes and noise. Manchester Road 
 traffic survey found that there was a 
 large proportion of buses and lorries 
 in a half hour period. The proposed   
{by-pass}will alleviate this problem   
 but will greatly disturb some         
 beautiful scenery at Plank Gate. Ash  
 clouds from by-pass work at Burnstones
 Tip have caused problems. Another     
 modern problem is that of low flying  
 military{aircraft}on manoeuvres. A    
 variety of{lichens}on Wharncliffe     
 Chase indicates clean air on hills.   </content>
