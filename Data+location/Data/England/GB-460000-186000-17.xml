		<title>17TRANSPORT NEAR WALLINGFORD</title>
		<content>{Transport}in this area consists of    
roads and the river.Ancient routes in  
the area are the Ridge Way paths and   
the{Icknield Way}.The river is used for
pleasure boating.The main Oxford to    
Henley,A423T road passes along the     
north of this area.The{Icknield Way}was
only 2.5 metres wide and much of it is 
not used today.A survey on the{A4074}  
which links Wallingford and Goring     
indicated a busy road.The road was 7.5 
metres wide with grassy edges.On a week
day an average of 100 cars and 55      
lorries pass in 30 minutes.As the area 
is mainly large farms most of the roads
are narrow country lanes often single  
track.There is a grass air strip near  
the Thames opposite Carmel College.
