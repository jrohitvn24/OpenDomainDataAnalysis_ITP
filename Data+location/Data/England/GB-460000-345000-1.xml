 Our grid square is located just north 
 east of Nottingham.It covers the Green
 belt,so very few new buildings can be 
 built.This is because the Green belt  
 is protected land.The two villages of 
{Lambley}and{Woodborough}are in the    
 square.The services offered are shops,
 pubs and a bus service.Part of Arnold 
 is also in our square.Both Lambley and
 Woodborough are in valleys,and have   
 quaint,picturesque houses plus some   
 modern ones.Footpaths lead from       
 Lambley to Woodborough,and go through 
 some rolling scenery.The villages     
 offer few leisure opportunities.This  
 is the commuter zone for Nottingham.  
 This is where people go into town in  
 the mornings.There are isolated       
 farms,and crops are grown.The lanes in
 our square are narrow,and quite hilly.
 The area has a certain rurality.      </content>
