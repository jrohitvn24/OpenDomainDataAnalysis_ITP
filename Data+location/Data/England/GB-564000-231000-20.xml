		<title>20WOMEN'S INSTITUTE</title>
		<content> There are Women's Institutes in the   
 villages.Women from the survey area   
 are mentioned.The movement was formed 
 in Great Britain in 1915.Its purpose  
 is to improve the quality of the life 
 of country-women and to help them     
 develope their own skills and talents.
 Monthly meetings are held in village  
 halls,at which Institute business,    
 interesting talks and demonstrations  
 on many subjects take place.Members   
 sell produce from their kitchens,gard-
 ens,and farms,so helping the older mem
 -bers and Institute friends.This may  
 be the only opportunity when some mem-
 bers can get together and talk.In an  
 area like this the Women's Institute  
 performs an important social function.
