		<content> I walk to school with a couple of     
 friends.When we arrive we go to our   
 classroom which is a mobile classroom 
 situated on the edge of the           
 playground. We put our bags in the    
 cloakroom and then go back outside to 
 play football until 9.00a.m.At 9.00a.m
 a teacher comes into the playground   
 and rings a bell,telling us to go     
 inside to our classrooms. For the     
 first tem minutes we do mental        
 arithmetic.Then we go over to the     
 school hall for assembly.Mr Murray,the
 headmaster,takes assembly.We sit in   
 rows of classeswith the youngest at   
 the front and the oldest at the       
 back.There are about 260 children in  
 the whole school but there are only 30
 in my class.In assembly we sing songs,
 say prayers and listen to a story told
 by Mr Murray.Sometimes there are      
 presentations and notices .           </content>
