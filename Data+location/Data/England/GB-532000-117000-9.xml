		<content>  The school was built in 1890. There  
 were two buildings, one for Infants   
 and the other for Juniors.  We still  
 use these buildings and call them East
 and West Victorian buildings.  The    
 Third years use the East Building and 
 the Second years use the West         
 building.  The classes were bigger in 
 those days and there were over 50     
 children in each class.  The writer's 
 mother was in Mr.Barkers class in 1958
 and he is still at our school.  There 
 were about 45 children in each class  
 then. In 1972 a new school, Birchwood 
 Grove, opened in south east Burgess   
 Hill and children were transferred    
 there from our school. In l985 there  
 were about 700 children in the school,
 with about 30 children in each class, 
 and 25 teachers.
