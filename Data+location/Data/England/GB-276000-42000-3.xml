		<title>03Country life in Frogmore.</title>
		<content>{From my garden I can see a farmer in  
{his tractor and he waves to me.       
{Sometimes I hear a huntsman shooting  
{rabbits in the fields. Frogmore has   
{lots of bridle paths. My brother has  
{two horses called Bonnie and Rowan    
{which he takes on the bridle paths. He
{has two fields near a wood which is at
{the top of a steep hill. We sometimes 
{go in the wood to collect sticks for  
{fire wood. The creek has lots of boats
{on it. The other day we saw some swans
{by the bridge and they had some fluffy
{little cygnets. If you go out on your 
{boat you can see an abandoned old     
{house. If you go up to the house you  
{can see it has a slide and swing and  
{nice countryside around it. There is a
{lot of wild life there such as        
{squirrels, many kinds of birds and    
{wild flowers. We often see a Buzzard  
{swooping down. }                      </content>
