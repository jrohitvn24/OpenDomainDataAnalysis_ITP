		<content> The block contains mainly farmland,   
 small woods, scattered farm houses and
 farm building. The land is used for   
 arable farming, the main crops being  
 almost entirely cereal and sugar beet.
 Although flat and relatively low lying
 the retention of hedgerows between    
 fields results in an interesting rural
 outlook. Being only about 9 miles     
 south of Norwich the area is, apart   
 from the farming activities, mainly   
 a dormitory area for people employed  
 in Norwich and the retird. The farming
 activities being highly mechanised    
 very few people are employed and most 
 residents in the village of Hempnall  
 are forced to work away from the area.
 Saxlingham Green consists of a farm or
 two, a few cottages and The Hall, now 
 Nursing Home.
