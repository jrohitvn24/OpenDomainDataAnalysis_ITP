		<content> The blocked lies half in Dorset and   
 half in Somerset.  The white post inn 
 boasts a bar where customers can stand
 with one foot in each county.  the    
 North West has manily level dairy     
 farming with a little arable land     
 scattered around and the eastern end  
 has Croton Ridge where sheep and beef 
 cattle are kept.  Houses in the       
 villages of Croton Denham, Sandford   
 Orcas &amp; Rimpton are built of local buf
 coloured limestone.  The manor House  
 at Sandford  Orcas is opened to the   
 public by the National Trust.         
 Sandford also has a W.I. a Youth Club 
 and Billiards and Snooker club. There 
 are no village schools now so the     
 children are taken by bus to the      
 neightbouring schools.  People living 
 in the area need cars to travel to    
 work, visit the Drs &amp; hospital or to  
 go shopping.  A car is not a luxury   </content>
