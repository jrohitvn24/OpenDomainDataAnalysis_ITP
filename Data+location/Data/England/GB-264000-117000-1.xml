		<content> The section is crossed from the north 
 west corner to centre south by the    
 River Taw, the railway line and the   
 A377 Barnstaple/Exeter road. The River
 Mole joins the Taw to the south. Both 
 are salmon rivers and fishing rights  
 are bought and sold for large sums of 
 money. The un-manned station at       
 Kingsnympton (formerly named South    
 Molton Road Station) is not near      
 Kingsnympton village but on the A377. 
 A pub, the Fortescue Arms, stands at  
 the junction of the B3226 (from South 
 Molton) with the A377. On the B3226 is
 Head Mill Trout Farm. This was started
 some five years ago and is now        
 flourishing, it caters for local trade
 but also sends fish to large London   
 stores (Harrods). The area is mainly  
 farming - dairy/sheep, with some crops
 for animal feed. Quite well wooded. On
 the Taw at Head Wood is a heronry.    </content>
