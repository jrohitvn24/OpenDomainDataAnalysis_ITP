		<title>03   INGESTRE FARM</title>
		<content>  Ingestre is a farming community on   
the outskirts of Stafford. Home farm   
situated near Ingestre is owned by Mr. 
Andrew Collier. Originally the 20th    
Earl  of Shrewsbury owned it.          
  Ingestre farm concentrates on        
growing mainly  mainly arable crops    
such as barley, wheat and potatoes.    
The wheat and grain   are bought by a  
merchant. The potatoes are mainly for  
human consumption although a small     
amount go for animal fodder.           
  Altogether there are 250 square      
acres of which a small percentage      
is used for the grazing of cattle and  
horses which are stabled in the        
grounds.                               
 The farm is soon to be a family       
concern when Mr. Collier shares it     
with his father and brother.
