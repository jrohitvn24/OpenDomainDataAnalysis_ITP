		<title>12Animal Life Around Nantwich.</title>
		<content>   The landscape of the area when      
 viewed from the air resembles a green 
 patchwork quilt, with freisian cows   
 contentedly grazing in almost every   
 field or shading themselves under the 
 oaks that abound in the hedges and    
 fields.It is in this environment that 
 man holds the delicate balance of the 
 ecosystems but the wide variety of    
 animal and plant life to be found is  
 evidence that man and nature do exist 
 side by side.Of the larger mammals,   
 the{fox and badger}both breed in the  
 area and can frequently be seen       
 crossing the roads.Of the smaller     
 mammals,{rabbit and hare}are common   
 along with the{hedgehog.}Breeding     
 colonies of{grey squirrels}are to be  
 found.{Stoat and weasel}hunt the      
 pasture whilst{mink}tracks have been  
 seen along the river bank.The rarer   
{harvest mouse}has also been observed. </content>
