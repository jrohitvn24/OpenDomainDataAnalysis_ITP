		<title>16HERONBANK FARM, BERKSWELL</title>
		<content> At Heronbank Farm eggs are produced by
 battery farming. 5 laying houses      
 contain 2000 chickens in each, with 50
 in each cage, all having been         
 vaccinated against disease. The amount
 of daylight and the temperature of 90F
 is crucial to the rearing of the      
 chickens, which eat 8 tons of mash and
 drink 917 gallons of water per year.  
 One chicken lays 270 eggs a year. The 
 eggs are collected, taken to the      
 grading house, carefully inspected,   
 graded by machine according to E.E.C. 
 regulations, then packed by hand.     
 There has been controversy over this  
 farm recently because of the chicken  
 manure. The sheds are cleaned out     
 weekly and 7 to 8 tons of manure is   
 removed every year. This is spread    
 over the surrounding land so there are
 often complaints from neighbours about
 the smell, especially in warm weather.</content>
