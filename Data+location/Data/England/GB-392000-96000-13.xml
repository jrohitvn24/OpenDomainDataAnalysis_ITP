		<title>13Woodlands Garden Centre</title>
		<content>    This ten acre field has been turned
 into a{garden centre}in the past year,
 propogating shrubs, heathers, conifers
 and ornamental trees by cuttings and  
 grafts, and selling mainly to the     
{garden nursery trade.                 
    Water is pumped from a{bore hole}on
 the land and into a reservoir. Soil is
 delivered in lorry loads of 10 cubic  
 metres, and the plants are grown in   
 pots on{constantly watered sand}in    
{polynet 'tunnels'.}These tunnels      
 consist of plastic sheeting on curved 
 supports, large enough for men and    
 machinery to work inside. The sheeting
 sides can be rolled up to allow air to
 filter through plastic netting, giving
 the interior the coolness and humidity
 of a cathedral even on the hottest    
 day. There are three of the tunnels at
 present and the area has to be        
 protected by rabbit and deer netting. </content>
