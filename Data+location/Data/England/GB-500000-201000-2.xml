		<title>02LIVING IN BOVINGDON</title>
		<content>      We talked to twenty-five people  
 who live in Bovingdon, twenty-three of
 them like living there. One couple had
 lived in the village all their lives. 
                                       
      Nineteen people had members of   
 their family who work out of the      
 village. One person we talked to      
 worked in the village themselves. Six 
 people work in London, eight in other 
 local towns, and the others work in   
 different places.                     
                                       
      Thirteen people travel by car,   
 five travel by bus, three walk and one
 goes by train. Only six people shop   
 mostly in the village, of the others  
 thirteen people shop in Hemel         
 Hempstead, two in Chesham, and one in 
 Watford.
