 The area contains two small villages  
 called Sutton-cum Lound and Lound     
 surrounded by farm land and grazing   
 land.  There is also a place called   
 Tiln.  It is mostly grassland with    
 just some houses.  There is quite a   
 lot of water which is mainly ash      
 lagoons and gravel pits.  The River   
 Idle runs through five of the squares.
  The river has recently been dug out  
 to improve the drainage of farm land. 
 There are several small woods.  There 
 are approximately ten farms and the   
 area is rich with wildlife because the
 water is good for birds and flowers.  
 The land is very flat.  Lots of the   
 roads are unsurfaced and stony and    
 they are not very comfortable to drive
 a car down.
