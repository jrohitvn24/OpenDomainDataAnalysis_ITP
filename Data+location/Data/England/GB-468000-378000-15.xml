		<content>{FARMING}ACCORDING TO KELLY'S DIRECTORY
 OF NOTTINGHAMSHIRE FOR THE YEAR 1912  
 THERE WERE EIGHT FARMERS IN AND AROUND
 EATON VILLAGE.TODAY THE NUMBER IS     
 LOWER;THE LAND IS OWNED,LEASED OR     
 RENTED BY ONLY THREE.THIS SHOWS HOW   
 FARM UNITS HAVE BECOME BIGGER DURING  
 THIS CENTURY AND THIS,ACCOMPANIED BY  
 FARM MECHANISATION,ACCOUNTS TO SOME   
 EXTENT FOR THE DECLINING POPULATION OF
 THE VILLAGE.NOWADAYS THE FARMERS GROW 
 MAINLY ARABLE CROPS SUCH AS POTATOES, 
 SUGAR BEET AND BARLEY.HOWEVER NEAR THE
 RIVER THE LAND IS GRASS USED FOR      
 GRAZING AND REARING CATTLE AND        
 SHEEP.IN THE PAST THE VILLAGERS OF    
 EATON GOT THEIR MILK FROM THE FARMER  
 BUT TODAY,LIKE US IN RETFORD,IT COMES 
 IN BOTTLES FROM THE DAIRY IN          
 NOTTINGHAM.
