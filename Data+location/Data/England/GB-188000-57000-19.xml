		<content> It is difficult for visitors to tell  
 the difference between the triangle of
 villages that makes up the district   
 even allowing for the name signs.     
 Inside the houses and bungalows       
 however,they would find things very   
 similar.Practically every house has a 
 colour television set,and many have   
 video recorders.Homes are comfortably 
 furnished and while some still have   
 open fires burning coal or wood, many 
 more are now centrally heated, mostly 
 by oil or electricity,as gas has not  
 yet been piped near many homes.       
 Cooking is mainly done by electricity,
 microwave ovens are becoming the      
 latest thing people want as they cook 
 things much more quickly.There are not
 many homes without labour saving      
 devices such as washing machines and  
 deep freezers.Gas is now coming into  
 the area if people want it.           </content>
