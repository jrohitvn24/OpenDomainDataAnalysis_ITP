		<content> Most people who live in the area own  
 their own homes, although there is a  
 large council estate at Penwithick.   
                                       
 The cost of a house depends on its    
 exact location; those nearer St.      
 Austell are usually more expensive.   
 At Yondertown, it is possible to buy a
 detached 3-bedroom house, with        
 bathroom, separate indoor toilet,     
 outbuildings, large garden and garage 
 for just under 24,000 pounds; a       
 similar residence nearer St.Austell   
 would be over 30,000 pounds.          
                                       
 Nearly all newly-built houses have    
 central heating, either gas or        
 electricity, and indoor bathrooms and 
 toilets. However, there are still some
 old cottages which lack facilites and 
 have an outside toilet at the bottom  
 of the garden.                        </content>
