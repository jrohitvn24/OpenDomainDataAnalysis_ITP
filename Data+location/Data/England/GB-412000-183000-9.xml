		<title>09Sports centres in Swindon</title>
		<content> Swindon has good leisure facilities   
 with the three main sports centres of 
 Oasis, Link, and Croft.               
 These offer a variety of activities   
 such as swimming, bowls, snooker,     
 weight-training, keep-fit, badminton, 
 roller-skating, squash and tennis, and
 outdoor sports like football, hockey, 
 athletics. There is a small charge to 
 use these facilities or to join in the
 training courses.                     
 The Oasis and Link centres are large  
 purpose built complexes of unusual    
 architecture. The Oasis was built on  
 old railway sidings and has a giant   
 dome covring the swimming-pool. The   
 Link centre was opened in 1985 and is 
 of steel piles and wire structure. It 
 offers an ice-rink which is already   
 attracting international stars. The   
 Croft centre is small but popular.
