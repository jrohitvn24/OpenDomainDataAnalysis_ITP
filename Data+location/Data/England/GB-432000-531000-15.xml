		<title>15BISHOP MIDDLEHAM SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The school in the village is primary  
 and has 130 children aged from 4+     
 to 11+ .                              
 It is a Church of England Aided School
 and as such is technically owned by   
 the school Governors who are          
 responsible for the education and any 
 external repairs or improvements to   
 the building.                         
 The building is semi open plan in     
 design and has 6 classrooms and a     
 central hall. There are at present 5  
 teachers and a Headteacher in charge  
 of the education of the school.       
 The school takes most of the children 
 from the village and also the children
 from the outlying villages of Bradbury
 and Mordon.                           
 The children follow a broad curriculum
 and transfer  at the age of 11+ to    
 Sedgefield Community College.
