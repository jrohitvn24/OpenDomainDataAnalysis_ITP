		<title>05RELIGION IN EAST MERSEA</title>
		<content>   Before World War Two the vicar lived
 in East Mersea but now he resides in  
 West Mersea 5kms away and serves both 
 parishes.The present vicar has been   
 there four years. He is helped by a   
 retired vicar and three Readers. There
 is a Church Warden who has lived in   
 East Mersea since 1921.               
   Weekly congregations drawn from the 
 local population are small although   
 holiday-makers from a nearby caravan  
 site attend services in the summer and
 there is always a large congregation  
 at Christmas when 105 have been       
 recorded.                             
   There are few ceremonies in the     
 church; only one marriage every two   
 years and about two funerals each     
 year.                                 
   Some people travel to Colchester to 
 attend other denominational churches  
 on Sundays.                           </content>
