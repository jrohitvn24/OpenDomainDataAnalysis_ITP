 entertainment,including

 Town Hall decides what production is  
 to be shown.                          
 More people attend on Friday night    
 than any other night.The Forum holds  
 490 people for a band concert,250 for 
 a dance and the most it will hold with
 the stage extended is 414.One full    
 house per production is the norm.     
 Things sometimes go wrong, one funny  
 occasion was when Terry Griffiths was 
 playing snooker.The game was so slow  
 the Lighting Man fell asleep and      
 accidentally knocked the switch for   
 the table light which went off.The    
 best attended productions have        
 been,101 Dalmations,Jungle Book,The   
 Life of Brian and amateur productions.</content>
