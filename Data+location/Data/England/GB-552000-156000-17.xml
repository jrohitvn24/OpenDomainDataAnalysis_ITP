		<content>Brickmaking as such has almost         
completely ceased in the area, but the 
sands, clays and gravels which made it 
so important to the economy of         
Sevenoaks are still very important.    
The major companies involved produce   
the raw materials and the finished     
products used in almost all forms of   
construction from garden patios to     
motorway bridges.  The range of        
concretes possible is very large and   
heavy lorries are constantly passing   
through the estates around the         
quarries. The quarries are vast and    
have greatly altered the geography of  
the Greatness area, which was of great 
importance historically to the growth  
of Sevenoaks.                          
The operations are now being used for  
the benefit of the area as the flooded 
disused quarries are used for          
watersports.                           </content>
