		<content> Sutton Mill Riding School utilizes the
 buildings that were formerly Sutton   
 Mill, an old water powered flour      
 mill.The buildings, now modified  may 
 be over 500 years old. Remains of     
 sluices that stored the mill water can
 still be found. Old mill wheels are a 
 feature of the grounds .              
 The riding school uses 15 horses and  
 ponies (9 geldings and 6 mares). The  
 oldest horse is 13 years old, the     
 youngest pony 4. They range in size   
 from very small ponies for young      
 children to 16 hands for adults. The  
 riding school uses a paddock and a    
 cross country field for lessons, and  
 cater for about 200 pupils a week. The
 average price for one hours riding is 
 Â£3.
