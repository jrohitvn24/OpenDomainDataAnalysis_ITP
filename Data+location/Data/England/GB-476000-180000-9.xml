		<title>09Our Thoughts Of Today</title>
		<content>The Twentieth Century is the most      
weird century that I have ever heard   
of.There were two World Wars and a     
threat of another one now - a Nuclear  
War.                                   
Our Environment is lovely,mainly farm  
land,river,hills and woods.We still    
have trees but they are being cut down 
very rapidly.We have lazers,robots,    
calculators,digital watches and        
computers because we have the Silicon  
Chip.                                  
We think about the Children and People 
who suffer in disasters.We write       
prayers for the people in Ethiopia and 
collect money for them.We have just    
raised 100 pounds for Doctor BarnardoÂ£s
Children.                              
We also care about conserving our      
Environment - protecting wildlife ,    
saving energy,stopping pollution,the   
destruction of trees,buildings and land</content>
