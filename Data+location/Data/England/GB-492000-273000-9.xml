		<content>I got up at 7.30 and went in to my mums
bed and I went back to bed for 5       
minutes.Then I went down stairs and my 
sister got some football stickers, she 
gave them to me so I stuck them on a   
book for 5 minutes.Next I went up      
stairs and had a wash,after that I went
down stairs again and played with my   
cars for 10 minutes.Then my sister told
me to get mum and dad by shouting so I 
did.At 7.50 my sister went to school   
and I said goodbye then I had corn     
flakes and milk for breakfast.Next I   
went up stairs and got dressed then I  
read the Daily Mirror.I got on my B.M.X
boots and after that Leigh and Sue came
round and took me to school.
