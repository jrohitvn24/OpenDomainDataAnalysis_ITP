		<title>01OVERVIEW, NORTH WEST DERBY</title>
		<content> This block covers the NW section of   
 one of the newest cities in England.  
 It is an area of marked contrasts     
 containing most of the important      
 features concerned with administration
 and commerce found in the city.       
 To the North and West are Darley &amp;    
 Markeaton Parks: large areas of open  
 space for recreation &amp; leisure.       
 All types of housing are represented  
 in the residential areas.             
 In the centre, Derby's blend of old   
 and new buildings are exemplified by  
 the Cathedral &amp; the Assembly Rooms.   
 Modern city developments alongside    
 conservation schemes have retained the
 character of earlier ages, for example
 the Georgian mansions in Friargate,   
 whilst providing for the needs of a   
 thriving industrial city.
