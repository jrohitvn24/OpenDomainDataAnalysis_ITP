		<title>10INDUSTRY IN BROMPTON</title>
		<content> Surrounded by the fertile farming land
 of the Vale of York,Brompton's major  
 concern is farming and agriculturally 
 allied industries such as farm        
 building erectors,bulk milk collectors
 and dairy suppliers.The remaining     
 industry is centred on a converted,   
 disused,linen mill,around which the   
 settlement developed.The small units  
 are service industries e.g.a local    
 merchants,car maintenance and repair  
 garages,scrap metal dealer and a      
 domestic electrician.The commercial   
 industry of Brompton is dispersed     
 through a selection of small shops:_2 
 general dealers,a Post Office,a       
 bakery,a newsagents,a hairdressers and
 a take_away fish and chip shop.Holiday
 and leisure are served through the    
 services of 4 public houses,catering  
 with a selection of meals and thus    
 providing another small industry.     </content>
