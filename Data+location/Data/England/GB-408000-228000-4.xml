		<content> The population of our area is mostly{ 
{retired people}because young people   
 cannot afford to buy the houses that  
 are for sale. The population is less  
 than years ago bacause less men are   
 needed to work the farms and women are
 having about 5 children less each.    
 Many families such as the {           
{Arkells,Browns and Hitchmans}can trace
 their families back for many years and
 most of their relations either came to
{Temple Guiting School}or went to{     
{Cutsdean school }when it was open.    
 Many of the families are related to   
 each other.
