		<content>{The Hampshire Cattle Breeders}store   
 semen from bulls in straws.   These   
 are put into liquid nitrogen until    
 they can be used.   They have portable
 containers for the straws and can take
 these not only around Britain but also
 abroad to other farms.   If it is     
 found that a certain bull's semen     
 produces a calf that has very good    
 milk then the semen can be sent to any
 farmer in the world whose cows are not
 producing very good milk, he will     
 inject the semen into his cows and    
 their calves will produce better milk.
 The breeders send their own men to    
 farms within their area where they    
 will inseminate the cows for the      
 farmer.   If the cows produce bulls   
 then the breeders have them, if the   
 cows produce cows, then the farmer    
 keeps them.   This is known as {
