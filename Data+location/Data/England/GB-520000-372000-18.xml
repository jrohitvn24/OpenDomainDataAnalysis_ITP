		<title>18A WALK NEAR BAUMBER.</title>
		<content> On the 10/6/85 at 1.33pm at a bearing 
 of 162 degrees we set off on a walk,  
 starting from farmers row.The first   
 thing I noticed was wheat then turning
 round I saw some Lincoln Reds and near
 them were some sheep, Border Leister  
 As I was walking down the lane I saw a
 gap in the hedge then suddenly I saw  
 two stoats hung on a tree.Then I saw  
 some more on the wire .They were there
 to scare other stoats away and to     
 show the farmer that the game keeper  
 had done his job.As I walked along I  
 spotted some fox droppings which are  
 mainly grey with a point at one end.A 
 bit later on somebody found a black   
 and red froghopper a small kind of    
 insect.Somebody noticed a piece of    
 iron sticking out it was a rabbit trap
 and there was also a stoat trap.The   
 day ended with a down pour.
