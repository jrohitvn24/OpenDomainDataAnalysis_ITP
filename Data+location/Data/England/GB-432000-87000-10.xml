		<title>10LOCAL HISTORY  THE CASTLE</title>
		<content> Henry V111 was the king who had       
 Yarmouth Castle built of Ashlar stone 
 Yarmouth Castle was built in 1545 and 
 completed in 1547. The reason the     
 castle was built is because the       
 Spanish and French were fighting our  
 country.The French burnt the church   
 down twice.Yarmouth castle was square 
 and was the first castle to have an   
 arrow head bastion. The carved stone  
 came from Sandown Castle.It had 12    
 guns and 3 cannons.The main entrance  
 isn't used anymore and has a carving  
 of the Tudor coat of arms over it.    
 There was a moat around it,which was  
 9m.wide and latrines ran down into    
 it. There was a cannon on the top of  
 the castle that could turn round to   
 fire at our enemies.The castle has a  
 gunpowder room and 2 rooms for        
 soldiers _ they were still there until
 1885.                                 </content>
