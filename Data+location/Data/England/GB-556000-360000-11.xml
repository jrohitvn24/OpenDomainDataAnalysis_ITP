		<title>11SCHOOL GIRL'S DAY SKEGNESS</title>
		<content> At 8 'o clock I get up and make my mum
 and dad a cup of tea.Then I get       
 dressed and have my breakfast.Usually 
 my breakst is a bowl of cereal like   
 bran flakes with milk on them.I don't 
 bother with a drink in the morning.   
 After breakfast I brush my teeth and  
 hair put on my shoes and set off for  
 school.                               
 At schoolI do some spellings and some 
 maths and then at 1030 it is play     
 time.After play I come in and do some 
 reading and other English.By that time
 it is lunch and I go home.I have snack
 soup,a Trio chocolate biscuit and some
 sandwiches.At 1300 I go back to school
 until 1530 when I go home then I go   
 out to play some times.I like to play 
 tennis in the street with my friends  
 or my mum.
