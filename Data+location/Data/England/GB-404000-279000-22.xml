<title>22PLaying fields have gone</title>
<content>

The schools' playing fields in Highbury Park no longer exist. The changing rooms were closed and what were at one time as many as four football pitches, and a hockey pitch with a cricket square and a running track in the summer have long gone. I was a teacher at a Kings Heath primary school. We used the those pitches both in curriculum time and after school for matches in the evening and on Saturday mornings but in the early 1990s they were all closed down. (I cant remember exactly when). We then began to play on two pitches behind houses in Tenbury Road.   &lt;br />
