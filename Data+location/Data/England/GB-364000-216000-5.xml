		<title>05EMPLOYMENT IN MITCHELDEAN</title>
		<content>     The main employer in the          
 Mitcheldean area is Rank Xerox who    
 make office machinery. Rank began in  
 Mitcheldean after the Second World    
 War, when they took over the old      
 brewery buildings. The plant soon grew
 until it came to dominate the small   
 town, taking up nearly half the built 
 up area.                              
     Of the machines manufactured, some
 are sold and the remainder are rented.
 The majority of sales are to EEC      
 countries. In 1975 the workforce was  
 over 4500, but by 1980 had dropped to 
 3800. By the end of 1985 it is        
 expected to have further diminished to
 around 1200. Despite this, future     
 prospects could be good, as the       
 company is expanding its range of     
 products to include the new           
 technology.                           
                                       </content>
