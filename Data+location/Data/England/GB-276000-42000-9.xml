		<title>09Our visit to Sherford, 1985.</title>
		<content> We visited Sherford as part of our    
 project work. First we visited the    
 church where the Reverend Ticquet     
 showed us round. It is a very old     
 church but still nice inside. There   
 are two little stair cases there, we  
 went up them and it was very dark.    
 When we had looked all around the     
 church we went to the village to do   
 some sketching. Sherford is tucked    
 away behind Frogmore. There are old   
 and new houses in Sherford, there are 
 council houses too. We all chose a    
 house to sketch. Some people drew     
 thatched cottages and some drew tiled 
 houses. There are four farms in       
 Sherford, one of which belongs to Mrs.
 Perkins. She showed us some of the    
 interesting things to see there.      
 Sherford is mostly surrounded by      
 crops. We all thought that it was a   
 very pleasant and peaceful place.     </content>
