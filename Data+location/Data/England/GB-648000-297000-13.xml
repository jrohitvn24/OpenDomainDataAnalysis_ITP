		<content>Hobbies are things that you do in your 
spare time i.e.time that you have free.
I have many hobbies and pastimes some  
of which include collecting postcards, 
stamps and raising money for charity.  
I have got about 800-1000 postcards and
about that in stamps. To collect stamps
you will have to have tweezers to pick 
up your stamps with so as not to put   
finger-prints on them, which could ruin
them. You also need an album with      
squares to stick them in. To stick the 
stamps in you need stamp hinges. Stamp 
hinges are little bits of paper bent in
half, with one side sticky so that you 
lick the sticky side and place it on   
your stamp and at the same time in your
album. Also you will need a magnifying 
glass so that you can read the country 
it came from originally. For postcards 
you need photo hinges.
