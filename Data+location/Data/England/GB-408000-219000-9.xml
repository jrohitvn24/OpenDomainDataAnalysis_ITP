		<content> Less than 20 children live in the     
 area. For children under 5 there is a 
 play group in Cold Aston 2km away. The
 infants and juniors attend school at  
 Cold Aston, parents on a rota take the
 children by car. The over 11 age group
 go either to the Bourton Vale         
 Comprehensive, 4km away or to         
 Northleach Grammar School, 8km away,  
 they are taken by Pulhams coaches. The
 nearest technical college is at       
 Cheltenham 20km away. For Sunday      
 school, children have to go to        
 surrounding villages.                 
                                       
 A little while ago in the cottage next
 to the Post Office, where a child had 
 died, the sound of footsteps and the  
 cries of a child were heard and       
 reported.
