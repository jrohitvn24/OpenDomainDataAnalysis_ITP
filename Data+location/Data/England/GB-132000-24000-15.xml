		<title>15Tourism in Sennen</title>
		<content> The tourist trade in Sennen affects   
 the life of the village in several    
 ways.Perhaps the most noticeable      
 effect is on family life.As many of   
 the local people rely on the tourist  
 trade to earn their living, it means  
 that many of them are at their busiest
 when the majority of people are on    
 holiday.Of course this in turn means  
 that the people of Sennen must try to 
 take their holidays in the winter,not 
 always easy,especially for those with 
 families.                             
 Another effect of the tourist trade is
 that many of the houses are only occup
 ied during the summer months.This has 
 become very apparent as we have carr  
 ied out house to house surveys in the 
 area.It is also interesting to note   
 that none of the schoolchildren come  
 from the Cove- most of the houses     
 being retirement homes or summer lets.</content>
