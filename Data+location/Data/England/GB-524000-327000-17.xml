		<content> Dear BBC,                             
      I have heard about your Domesday 
 project and I like the idea very much.
      Our type of land is mainly       
 farming and few roads.  We have odd   
 shops here and there and school       
 buildings.  We have a church, a       
 village hall, a school, a park, a golf
 course and a sewage plant.            
      Our school field has trees       
 surrounding it and it is 1 acre       
 (counting our car park).              
      There are 2 lorry transport      
 centres and they travel to the sugar  
 beet factory and back.  But there are 
 risks of danger to every child.       
      We have a river called the River 
 Glen and our fishermen are fine.  We  
 have a Sluice and there are lots and  
 lots of boats.                        
             Yours Sincerely,          
                Helen Rowbottom (Age 9)</content>
