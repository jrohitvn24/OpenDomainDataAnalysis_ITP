		<title>19    Itchen Bridge</title>
		<content>   On the first of June 1977,the long  
 awaited fixed crossing between Chapel 
 and Woolston was opened,and on the    
 13th July 1977, was officially named  
 "Itchen bridge" by H.R.H. Princess    
 Alexandria.The bridge is half a mile  
 long.It costs 20p to cross over at off
 peak and 30p at peak hours (from 5 to 
 6 in the evening) for cars,and cuts   
 the journey by 4 miles from Woolston  
 to the city-centre in Southampton.    
   This area mainly consists of        
 public houses,warehouses and works.   
   The River Itchen itself is          
 green,muddy water.There is a major    
 developement scheme for the area      
 underneath the Itchen Bride.          
 People's views: Many people say that  
 the the roads need reconditioning.
