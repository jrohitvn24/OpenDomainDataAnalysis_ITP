		<content> In order to discover some of the      
 significant changes in the area over  
 the last fifty years, six local       
 inhabitants were interviewed. They    
 were a Church of England clergyman, a 
 butcher, a publican, an accountant    
 (all elderly) and a young housewife.  
                                       
 Population  Greatly increased with    
             many young couples        
             commuting by car to       
             neighbouring towns to     
             work.                     
                                       
 Environment Many new homes and the    
             construction of the M5    
             motorway and northern link
             road have changed a rural 
             area into an urban group  
             living in a rural         
             environment.
