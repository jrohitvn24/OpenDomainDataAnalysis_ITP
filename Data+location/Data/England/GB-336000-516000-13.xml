		<content> MOST HOUSES BUILT IN THE LAKE DISTRICT
 ARE BUILT FROM LAKELAND STONE. THE    
 STONE WAS QUARRIED FROM HARTSOP. THE  
 NEWER HOUSES LIKE THE COUNCIL HOUSES  
 ARE BUILT OF BRICK. MOSTLY IN         
 PATTERDALE PEOPLE LIVE IN COTTAGES.   
 SOME OF THE COTTAGES ROUND HERE ARE   
 HOLIDAY COTTAGES FOR PEOPLE THAT LIVE 
 AWAY. IN OUR AREA THERE ARE ABOUT 200 
 HOUSES AND HOMES . THE BIGGEST HOUSE  
 IS PATTERDALE HALL.THERE ARE QUITE A  
 LOT OF PUBS AND HOTELS. IN THE SUMMER 
 THEY GET QUITE BUSY, BECAUSE OF THE   
 TOURIST TRADE.  SOME OF THE HOUSES IN 
 OUR  AREA ARE OF SPECIAL HISTORIC     
 INTEREST AND NOW BELONG TO THE        
 NATIONAL TRUST.  IN SOME OF THE REMOTE
 MOUNTAIN VALLEYS SOME OF THE SHEPHERDS
 COTTAGES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AS       
 CLIMBING AND MOUNTAINEERING HUTS.
