 Trail. The{Trim Trail}is scattered all
 around the park. In the Trim Trail    
 there are many different exercises,   
 like walking along thin planks and    
 doing chin ups where you hold on to a 
 bar and lift your chin over it. There 
 are 20 different exercises at Sanders,
 which are really good.                
    Sanders park is often used to      
 finish races, like a cycle race which 
 was held in the February half term.   
 After the{Carnival}in Bromsgrove there
 is a fete in Sanders Park.There were  
 lots of games and people could try    
 pottery making. There were folk       
 singers and pony rides. You could buy 
 all sorts of things from stalls.      
 Altogether it was a lot of fun and    
 excitement.
