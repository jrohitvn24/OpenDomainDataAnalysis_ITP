		<content>    As might be expected in a rural    
 environment where most people had     
 gardens,73% had a vegtable plot and   
 54% owned a greenhouse. There were 12 
 households with swimming pools. The   
 questions relating to peoples         
 involvment in the community life of   
 the area shows that a third regularly 
 attended a place of worship and       
 approximately the same number belonged
 to some local organistation,the most  
 frequently mentioned being the W.I.   
 Sports clubs (cricket and             
 badminton),political groups and       
 gardening associations were also      
 popular. All the households surveyed  
 had a T.V set,96% had a telephone,and 
 87% owned a deep-freeze. Perhaps the  
 fact that many of the households own  
 land accounts for the fact that of the
 80% who kept pets there were in fact  
 48 horses.                            </content>
