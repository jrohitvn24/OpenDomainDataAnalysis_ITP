		<title>05St. Lucia's church cont.</title>
		<content>    In the church yard  there are yew  
 trees, and they were  used for        
 defence. People fashioned longbows    
 from the wood, the bow was made       
 of wood from the yew tree, because    
 the wood can bend without breaking.   
 There are still marks that can be seen
 today on the outside of the church    
 wall, where people used to sharpen    
 arrow heads. The oldest grave         
 stone in the church yard that can     
 still be seen today,was put there in  
 1737.We  found evidence of 209 tombs  
 and grave stones that are still       
 existing today in the church yard.    
 You  can still see the grave of Hugh  
 Dryden Corbet who died December 5th   
 1936.He was Lord of the manor at      
 Sundorne.Most of his family were      
 burried in St. Lucia's church yard.
