 There are a large number of           
 denominations represented in this     
 area.The largest is the Church of     
 England with the most number of       
 churches.These are dominated by the   
 nearby Cathedral of Exeter.The other  
 denominations which are represented   
 by more than one church are the       
 Methodists,Roman Catholics and the    
 United Reform. The smaller churches   
 are the Gospels,Baptists, Christian   
 Scientists,Spiritualists, Jehovah's   
 Witness and the  Church of Jesus      
 Christ of Later Day Saints.           
  Historically the area was dominated  
 by Polsloe Priory which was built on  
 land given to the nuns by William de  
 Tracey, one of the knights who slew   
 Thomas a Beckett. The priory was      
 destroyed during the dissolution by   
 Henry V111.                           </content>
