		<content> The majority of houses were built in  
 early 1900'and many are connected with
 farming.  A declining workforce on the
 land has meant house' being occupied  
 by persons working outside the        
 village.  In the southwest corner of  
 the area a modern housing complex of  
 150 houses are used as married        
 quarters for the local Army camp.     
 Two major roads cross in the area     
 these are the 303 main road from      
 London to the west and the A34 which  
 is the main link from the Midlands to 
 the southern parts.
