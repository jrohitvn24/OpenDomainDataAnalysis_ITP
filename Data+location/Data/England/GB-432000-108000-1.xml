		<content> The area that we are surveying is the 
 area immediately surrounding Ashurst. 
 The land is mainly covered by Forestry
 Commission Woodland. The Forestry     
 Commission are a group of people who  
 look after the forests. The area also 
 includes some farm land and some heath
 &amp; marsh land. There is a camping site 
 and thus the area is used for         
 recreation puposes such as walking and
 picnicing. The area covers the        
 southern half of Ashurst and the area 
 to the south. The grid also contains  
 the source of the Beaulieu River.     
 It also contains the A35 main road and
 some of the Southampton to Bournemouth
 railway line. The areas main          
 attraction is the forest but it also  
 has the New Forest Butterfly farm.    
 This is a well known local attraction.
