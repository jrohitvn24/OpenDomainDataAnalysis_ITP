		<title>14WHATS CHANGED IN THE VILLAGE</title>
		<content>  College Farm was a working farm up to
 20 years ago.The house I now live in  
 was once part of the orchard &amp;the     
 garden is where the poultry were kept.
 Flamstead School is built on part of  
 the farmland,also Pye Gardens &amp;       
 College Close.Four farm cotteges by   
 the school were pulled down &amp; a chapel
 was built.Trowley Bottom chapel was   
 sold &amp; used as a private house.Trowley
 Bottom once had a shop at the top of  
 the hill but it closed over 30 years  
 ago.Bell Cottage was once an Inn.     
 Legend has it that Dick Turpin stayed 
 there.Later it became a shop until    
 about 25 years ago.What is now the    
 butchers was once a bakery during the 
 same period.The one building that has 
 remained over the last 900 years is   
 St. Leonards Paris Church,built of    
 flint and brick,partly from           
 Verulamium.                           </content>
