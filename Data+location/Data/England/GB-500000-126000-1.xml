   The village of Kirdford is between  
 Petworth and Billingshurst in the     
 county of West Sussex and is 75 feet  
 above sea level.It is about 20 miles  
 from the sea.                         
   Kirdford is a small quiet village   
 in beautiful Wealden countryside. A   
 tributary of the river Arun runs      
 through the area.                     
   It is said that Kirdford received   
 it's name from a man called Cyerend   
 who lived near the ford in the twelfth
 century.He was well known so the      
 people who lived near-by decided      
 to call the ford after him.They called
 it Cyerend ford.Over the years it has 
 changed to Kirdford which is what the 
 village is called today.
