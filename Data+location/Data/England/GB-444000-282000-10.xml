		<title>10A walk around Monks Kirby</title>
		<content> Monks Kirby village is bordered on all
 sides by farmland.Most of the fields  
 are used for growing crops such as    
 oil_seed rape,barley,oats and wheat.  
 The majority of the fields have       
 hedgerows as opposed to fencing which 
 provide ample refuge for a wide       
 variety of wild life,flowers and      
 grasses.Scattered here and there are a
 number of small wooded areas which may
 at one time have been copiced.Owing to
 natural wastage and possibly Dutch Elm
 disease there are quite a number of   
 dead trees scattered throughout the   
 hedgerows.On a recent walk the        
 children of Brockhurst Middle School  
 counted 33 dead trees in a relatively 
 small stretch of country lane.Houses  
 in the village are old and of timber  
 beam and brick construction.A number  
 of new houses which make an attempt to
 blend in have been built recently.    </content>
