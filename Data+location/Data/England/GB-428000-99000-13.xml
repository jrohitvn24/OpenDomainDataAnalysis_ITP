		<title>13RECREATION - Village Hall</title>
		<content>   Brockenhurst Village Hall stands on 
 part of the site of the old County    
 High School and replaces the          
 demolished Morant Hall in Lyndhurst   
 Road. It was opened on the 11th       
 September 1982, having been funded    
 through various sponsorships and      
 grants from various concils.          
   There are three main rooms- the     
 Forest Room, Beech Room and Oak Room -
 and there is also a well equipped     
 kitchen. The variety of sports        
 equipment and the stage are attractive
 facilities for the sporting and social
 occasions.                            
   The hall caters for all ages from   
 Play School to Womens Institute.      
 Activities include badminton, indoor  
 bowls, gymnastics, youth club,        
 brownies and the British Legion. There
 are regular dances and 'discos' for   
 both age groups - old and young.      </content>
