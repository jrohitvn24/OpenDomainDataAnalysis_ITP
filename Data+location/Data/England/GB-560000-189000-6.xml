		<title>06THORNDON HALL</title>
		<content> The present Hall is the remains of the
 'New Hall' designed by James Paine,   
 started in 1764 and occupied six years
 later. Part of the 'New Hall' was     
 destroyed by fire in 1878  and the    
 Petre family moved to Ingatestone     
 Hall.                                 
   At the moment the central part of   
 the hall has been converted into      
 thirty-seven appartments which people 
 lease from Bates the Builders. They   
 are working on the East wing to make  
 sixteen dwellings. The old bakery and 
 stable block have been made into eight
 cottages.                             
   The remaninder of the Hall is used  
 as the offices and Club House of      
 Thorndon Park Golf Club.
