		<title>03SUTTONS SEEDS FACTORY</title>
		<content> On the 7th of June, the third year    
 class went to{SUTTONS SEEDS.}We set   
 off at ten o'clock to get there at    
 half past.There are two{Suttons Seeds}
 buildings but they are not far apart  
 so it was only a quick walk to each   
 building.In he lab. there were small  
 house shaped boxes which were see     
 through.They put seeds in them and    
 when they grow to the top of the box  
 they take the lid off.They get a      
 certain kind of paper and to get the  
 seeds on quicker they use a small     
 hover and shake on a hundred  seeds to
 go on the holes.They then take off the
 spare seeds and press the hover down  
 onto the paper.This releases the seeds
 so they are nicely set out.Once we had
 seen everything in that building we   
 walked down to the main factory where 
 all the packing was done.We enjoyed   
 our visit very much.                  </content>
