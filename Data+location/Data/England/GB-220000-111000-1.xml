		<content> The area is mainly Morwenstow the most
 northerly parish in Cornwall,with part
 of Kilkhampton.                       
 It is mainly farmland  on the Atlantic
 coast over 400ft asl. Here are hamlets
 of Coombe and Woodford with many small
 scattered farms.  No major roads cross
 the area and high ways range from good
 unclassified roads to footpaths.      
 A very scenic  area with wide views as
 trees only grow in the deep coombes.  
 The area  is remote  and secluded with
 the only outside influence coming from
 CSOS Morwenstow,  a satellite research
 station.                              
 Visitors  are welcomed  but determined
 with many merely passng through on the
 North Cornwall Coastal footpath. Those
 who do stay fall in love with this    
 unspoiled area and are captivated.    
 They frequently return year after     
 year.                                 </content>
