		<content>We have a fair number of events in     
Chorleywood like school fetes, May     
Fairs and a Donkey Derby. Nearly every 
school in the area has a school fete   
every year. They are normally on a     
Saturday in July. Sometimes they clash 
like this year in which I know of three
schools which had their fetes on the   
same day. Then there is the May Fair   
Clement Danes hold which is now quite a
big occasion. It has stalls,games,     
sideshows and fun things. Lastly the   
Donkey Derby. This is always held on   
the 2nd Saturday of June. It normally  
raises lots of money for charities and 
this year raised three and a half      
thousand pounds for different          
charities. This year most of the money 
went to buy a special orthopedic bed   
for people with bad burns and the      
remainder will go to the Ethiopia and  
Sudan famine appeals.                  </content>
