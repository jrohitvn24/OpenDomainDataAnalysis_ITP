		<content>      Survey of Trees and Shrubs.      
 Our survey took place in Leyton during
 the months of May and June,1985.The   
 area we looked at closely was         
 surrounded by Leyton High Road,Lea    
 Bridge Road and Church Road.We studied
 all of the trees and shrubs in these  
 streets .We were unable to study the  
 trees and shrubs in peoples back      
 gardens.We tried to find aerial       
 photographs of Leyton to agree our    
 findings but we found this impossible.
 These are our results:                
 1166 shrubs                           
  376 saplings                         
  282 young trees                      
  363 mature trees                     
   13 dead trees
