		<content>  In Loughton 10% of the population are
 unemployed. Most of the{jobs}available
 are in shops or services and a large  
 number of the population commute to   
 London.                               
  The total{population}of Loughton is  
 almost 19 thousand and of these 40%   
 are in the dependant age group. With  
 an area of 1011 hectares, the average 
 density is 19 people per hectare.     
  Half of the{landscape}of the Loughton
 area is built up and half is protected
 forest. Industry and housing are built
 right up to the forest boundaries.With
 pressure of transport and the public, 
 the forest is being slowly eroded.    
  The{housing}is very mixed, mainly    
 private, the dominant type being semi-
 detached. There are a number of new   
 estates and a few large detached      
 areas. There is one large council     
 housing estate but very few flats.    </content>
