		<title>13CHADDESLEY CORBETT BROWNIES</title>
		<content> I belong to the 1st Chaddesley Corbett
 Brownie Pack. I enjoy Brownies because
 we do lots of badges like Cooks, House
 Orderly and Jester, that is quite hard
 because you have to do a play and say 
 a poem. Joanna's Aunty Paddy and Mrs. 
 Grange and Mrs. Rumsey and Mrs. Baines
 and Mrs. Pugh test us.                
 You play lots of games like floods and
 outdoor games like rounders and stuck 
 in the mud. We play games like dead   
 lions and ladders inside.             
 We had a teddy bears picnic on Monday.
 We went to Malvern for the celebration
 of 75 years of Guiding.               
 We joined in Crackerjack at the B.B.C.
 in London. The smoke alarm went off   
 and we went outside and saw the fire  
 engines.                              
 We went on parade in Kidderminster for
 St. Georges Day and we go to church.  
 We have parties at the village hall.  </content>
