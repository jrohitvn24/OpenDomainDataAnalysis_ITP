		<title>01The Fields near Much Cowarne</title>
		<content> This is a very quiet aea, one of the  
 few squares that does not have a      
 public house, shop or school.         
 The area is mostly farmland, quite    
 rich land used for varied cultivation.
 Several small wooded areas exist in   
 the south, whereas the centre and     
 north is all fields with isolated     
 buildings.                            
 The only break to this pattern is a   
 granary just half a kilometre south   
 west of much Cowarne, there is a      
 quarry now disused, and the school has
 been closed for some time
