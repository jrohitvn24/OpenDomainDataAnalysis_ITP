		<content> We left for Gatwick at 5.45 am and on 
 arrival we had to show our passports  
 and load our cases onto the plane.    
 We got on the plane at 9.15 am and it 
 was brilliant.It was a Boeing 737.    
                                       
 We touched down at Ryde airport at    
 10.30 and headed for Santo Susana.    
                                       
 As soon as we had unpacked we ran     
 downstairs and into the swimming pool.
                                       
 The best night was when we went to    
 'Charlie Chaplin's' for a meal,thento 
 a disco called 'The Tropical'.        
                                       
 Another night we went to a medieval   
 night and had a roast meal and wine   
 from a jug.
