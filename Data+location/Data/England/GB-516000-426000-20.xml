		<title>20A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SARAH</title>
		<content> In the morning I get up at 8.15,I feel
 like going to sleep again but I get   
 out of bed and go to the bathroom.I   
 have to wait a long time to get washed
 because my sister is "hours" in the   
 bathroom.Finally I get washed and make
 my mind up about what to wear.When I  
 have chosen I run downstairs and greet
 my dog.I have to play with him        
 otherwise he goes in his box and      
 sulks.My mum gives me a cup of tea,I  
 can't eat breakfast,and when I have   
 finished I run back upstairs,clean my 
 teeth, brush my hair,put my coat on   
 and walk to school.At dinner time I go
 home and have my dinner and at 1pm    
 I go back to school.At 3.30pm I leave 
 school,I go home,drop in the armchair 
 and my mum gives me a drink.At 5pm I  
 have my tea.Later I go out to play.At 
 8.30pm I go in,have a drink and some  
 sweets,then I go to bed.              </content>
