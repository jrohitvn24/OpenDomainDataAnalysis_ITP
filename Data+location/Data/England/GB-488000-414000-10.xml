		<title>10Our Questionnaires</title>
		<content> To give us a better idea of what life 
 is like for people in our village we  
 decided to conduct a survey.We wanted 
 to find out information such as what  
 the population actually is.We hoped to
 find out about employment,unemployment
 and how far people travelled to       
 work.We wanted to find out about the  
 life styles of the people, how long   
 they had lived in our village and what
 they liked or disliked about living   
 here.To decide how many questionnaires
 we needed we used the Electoral Roll  
 and had extra sheets printed for newly
 built homes.We divided our village up 
 between the members of our class and  
 delivered the questionaires.After     
 about 10 days,we returned to collect  
 the completed sheets.We delivered 37  
 questionnaires and 23 were returned.
