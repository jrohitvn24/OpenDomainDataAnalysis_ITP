		<content> Generally speaking the inhabitants of 
 the area are a{contented}lot.Newcomers
 are struck by the friendship and      
 welcome they receive, and settle in   
 quickly.There is virtually no unemploy
 ment.There is some disquiet about the 
 volume and speed of{traffic}passing   
 through the village and disappointment
 at the shelving of plans for a bypass 
 and refusal of a speed limit for the  
 village.The{building}of council       
 bungalows for retirement would be     
 desirable thus freeing some{housing   
 for young people and generally        
 allowing those who wish to stay in the
 area to do so.Some complain ofthe high
 cost of travel and high prices charged
 by{travelling}shops.Advantages include
 a regular bus service to town, yet a  
 pleasant rural environment with all   
 the freedoms and activities of village
 life.                                 </content>
