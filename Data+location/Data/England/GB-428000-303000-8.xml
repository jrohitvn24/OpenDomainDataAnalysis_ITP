		<content> Mrs. Brigg aged 84 born 1901          
 Polesworth.My dad was a butcher in    
 Polesworth.I left school when I was 14
 and went to work in the office at     
 Pooley Colliery.I came to Orton when I
 was 16 as my family owned property    
 here. When I was 21 I eloped with the 
 vicar's son.He had a private education
 and was training to be a draughtsman. 
 We lived 5 years at the vicarage and  
 then moved to a croft in the garden.  
 The {conditions}were no good for your 
 health. Itwas a happy village in those
 days. The main road was mud with wells
 up the street to draw water .There was
 a {wake}at Orton in August.We had a   
 fair with ponies turning the          
 roundabouts.We had a tea in the school
 room.An old man from the village      
 played the harmonium,the vicar's wife 
 played the piano and my husband played
 the bones.                            </content>
