		<content> The status of Lundy is somewhat       
 unusual and former owners,especially  
 Mr.Harman,fought hard to retain their 
 freedoms.Gradually though it is       
 accepting more outside help and       
 authority.Expensive repairs to the    
 Beach Road in 1978 received help      
 from both the Torridge District       
 Council and Devon County Council.     
 The island falls within the South     
 Devon constituency but there is no    
 polling station and all the residents 
 are granted a postal vote.            
 Crime doesn't seem to pose much of a  
 problem.The only recent offence was   
 over 4 years ago when some day        
 trippers off the paddle steamer were  
 involved in a theft from one of the   
 letting properties.                   
 Licensing laws do not apply to the    
 Tavern but recently opening times have
 been regularised for convenience.     </content>
