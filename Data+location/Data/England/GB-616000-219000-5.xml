		<title>05THE FARMER &amp; OUR CLIMATE</title>
		<content>{ Type of Land-}The land is fairly flat
 and this is a help because there isn't
 much problem with drainage . The soil 
 is mainly clay which is good for      
 cereals.                              
{Wind-}The east winds we get are       
 sometimes a hindrance especially when 
 the farmer wants to go spraying or    
 fertilising .It is also a hindrance at
 harvest time when the wind can shake  
 the heads offthe barley and wheat.In  
 one year,the farmer can lose quarter  
 of his crop because of the wind.In the
 winter snows the wind drives it into  
 drifts against the hedges.            
{Rainfall-}Our rainfall here is 22.5   
 inches averaged over the last 10      
 years.This is classed as semi-desert  
 on rainfall charts. It isn't enough.  
{Sunshine-}In summer we average 210 hrs
 of sunshine a month. This is about 8  
 hrs a day &amp; it helps ripen the wheat. </content>
