		<content> St. George's School in Reforne stands 
 today almost unchanged since its      
 opening on April 6th, 1857.           
 Constructed at a cost of Â£775, the    
 building has for 112 years educated in
 its classroom many thousands of the   
 islands children until it was closed  
 in 1969 and left vacant.  In December 
 1981, the Island of Portland Heritage 
 Trust was formed and, within three    
 months, had raised the Â£25,000 needed 
 to purchase the building.  The Trust, 
 in conjunction with the West Country  
 Tourist Board, have now opened the    
 islands first information centre to   
 encourage visitors to appreciate both 
 the wild-life and the natural beauty  
 of the landscape of the island.  It is
 planned that St. George's Centre will 
 act as a focus and resource base for  
 all forms of community activity and   
 interest.                             </content>
