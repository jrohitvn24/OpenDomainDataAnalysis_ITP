		<content> The Country Park at Talkin Tarn is the
 scene of many recreational activities.
 On a busy day, over a thousand        
 visitors may be seen. They picnic,    
 paddle, hire rowing boats, fish and   
 patronise the shop. Swimming is       
 discouraged because the water is very 
 cold away from the edge.              
 There are camping facilities, nature  
 trails and guided walks. School groups
 use the area for sailing, study and   
 learning activities. Annually there   
 are sailing and rowing regattas.      
 In snowy weather, the hill slopes are 
 ideal for tobogganing. Even in cold,  
 stormy weather there is usually       
 somebody to be seen walking a dog on  
 the footpath round the Tarn.          
 With so much water activity, a rescue 
 craft which can reach anyone in       
 difficulty is essential, and is used  
 frequently.                           </content>
