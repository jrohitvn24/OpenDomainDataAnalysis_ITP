{ Up Hatherley}is a suburb of          
{Cheltenham}and over the years it has  
 grown a great deal.In{1851}it was a   
 small village with about{37}people.The
 first addition to Hatherley was the   
 Coombe Glen estate in about{1960}which
 made Hatherley much bigger.           
  The{1984} plan was to build a new    
{Greatfield Park Estate}and to make a  
 new{link road}from the A46 Shurdington
 road to the A40 Cheltenham/Gloucester 
 road.This{link road}is still being    
 considered,according to the plan it   
 will be built in{1992,}but it could   
 be completed by{1987}if local pressure
 is successful.                        
  The Estate is opposite some other    
 houses where we did a survey on a     
 sample of 20 residents.The questions  
 we asked them follow on page 4.
