 hour.The planes owned by the flying   
 school are used for about five hours a

 hangars are used for storage.The      
 aerodrome was owned by De Havilland   
 until the second world war.It was then
 taken over by the R.A.F and was used  
 as a decoy and training base until    
 1953.Then it was bought by Mr Summers 
 of the London Aero Club.Then it became
 used by private aircraft.It was       
 illegally used to bring in immigrants.
