		<title>04Ecology of Longdon  (Flora)</title>
		<content>  "Longdon" is derived from the Anglo- 
 Saxon meaning  "large dune"  or  long 
 curving ridge.                        
   The{Severn-Trent Water Board }test- 
 drilled Longdon Marsh with a view to  
 making a  reservoir  to  serve  North 
 Worcestershire.  Although the subsoil 
 was  impervious  clay,  the  cost was 
 prohibitive. The  marsh has traces of 
 salt  in  it  and{fennel}grows freely 
 there. {Wild  orchids}have been found 
 in 2B.                                
  The  indigenous  trees  are {elm}and 
{willow }though  the elm is struggling 
 after the ravages of Dutch elm disease
 in  the  l97O's.   The  local  school 
 children in twenty years have planted 
 over 200 trees of different species.  
   In a strip of wood by the main road 
 there are an unusually high number of 
{yew}trees.
