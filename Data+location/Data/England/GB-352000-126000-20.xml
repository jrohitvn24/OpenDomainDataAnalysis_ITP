		<content>  THE ABBEY.In spite of its name this  
 house was never a monastery.The core  
 is mediaeval and its irregular plan   
 would suggest that an existing        
 structure of some size determined the 
 character of the late 16th.century    
 remodelling.The house originally      
 (before the Reformation) possessed a  
 chapel dedicated in honour of the Holy
 Ghost and it is probable that the     
 shell of this exists in the present   
 south range of buildings.The          
 buttresses are certainly mediaeval and
 there are indications of a large      
 window in the east gable.The drawing  
 room has handsome early 17th.century  
 panelling and there are several       
 paintings of Oliver Cromwell,from whom
 the present owner of the house is     
 descended.The house had been used as a
 farmstead and was  restored by Claude 
 Neville who bought it in 1902.        </content>
