		<content> Grinshill is an area of great         
 importance in Shropshire for          
 industrial and leisure purposes and   
 although the eastern section of the   
 hill is outside this D block, its     
 influence is of great importance to   
 the village of Clive and the local    
 area. The sandstone of Grinshill is of
 particularly good quality as building 
 stone and is used in many local       
 buildings as well as at such places as
 10, Downing Street and the Bluecoats  
 School, Liverpool. This creamy        
 coloured stone is still quarried at   
 Grinshill. The hill itself is also    
 important as a leisure area with many 
 attractive walks and interesting      
 wildlife and plants. One access to the
 hill can be gained by walking up a    
 path, of bare stone in places,        
 alongside Clive church.This is also   
 the access to the village school.     </content>
