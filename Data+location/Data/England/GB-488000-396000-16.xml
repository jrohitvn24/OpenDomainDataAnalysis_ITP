		<title>16Scotton Clubs</title>
		<content> Scotton's oldest club founded in 1935,
 Scotton and District WI currently has 
 75 members (40 from Scotton, the rest 
 from nearby villages). A lively and   
 friendly group, it has a good         
 proportion of young members and runs a
 range of activities (sport, drama,    
 craft - and other - classes, outings  
 etc.) Members help with Meals on      
 Wheels and trolley shops for the      
 residents of two local Rest Homes.    
 Friendship Club for senior citizens   
 meets weekly in the village hall for  
 an informal, social afternoon. Self   
 supporting the club runs outings and  
 hosts a Christmas party for all       
 village pensioners. Archery Club for  
 adults and children meets weekly at   
 Manor Farm in summer. Dance Club meets
 weekly from autumn to spring for      
 sequence dancing: its future is un-   
 certain as the instructors are moving.</content>
