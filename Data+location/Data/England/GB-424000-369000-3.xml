		<content>     This 12 Km block is wholly owned  
 by the{Trustees of the Chatsworth     
{Settlement,}and the house which is    
 called{Chatsworth House}dominates the 
 way of life of all who live here.     
     The House has had many alterations
 in its life and currently there are   
 some 175 rooms. It is a very          
 attractive building both inside and   
 out and is worthy of its' nickname    
{"The Palace of the Peak."}It is the   
 home of the Duke and Duchess of       
 Devonshire and is situated at 400 feet
 above sea level just to the east of   
 the River Derwent. This river itself  
 runs roughly north and south          
 dissecting the area in two. Behind the
 House to the east is a double         
 escarpment with a plateau at 800 feet,
 the final escarpment reaching an open 
 moor at 1000 feet.
