   The Queen Mother came on Monday 10th
 June 1985.                            
   Mr Robert Dorrien-Smith, lessee of  
 Tresco,asked Mr. Kirk,our Headteacher,
 if the boys and girls from Tresco     
 School would like to dance for the    
 Queen Mother. We were delighted to    
 dance for such a kind and royal lady. 
   There were camers from ITV and lots 
 and lots of people.                   
   She was coming down the road. She   
 was all in blue. On her hat there was 
 a blue rose.                          
   Rachel, my friend, gave her some    
 flowers and James announced the       
 dances.                               
   Then it all happened.
