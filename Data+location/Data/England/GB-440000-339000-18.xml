		<title>18A BETTER VILLAGE--S.LEDIS</title>
		<content> I THINK THE WEST HALLAM AREA NEEDS TO 
 BE IMPROVED IN MANY WAYS.ONE THING WE 
 PARTICULARLY NEED IS A SECONDARY      
 SCHOOL.WHY? BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF  
 NEW HOUSES BEING BUILT.ABOUT 4 OUT OF 
 5 HOUSES HAVE CHILDREN WHO WILL COME  
 TO SCARGILL SCHOOL.WHEN THE 4TH YEAR  
 CHILDREN LEAVE THEY WILL HAVE TO GO A 
 LONG WAY ON THE BUS TO ILKESTON.      
  A HOSPITAL IS ANOTHER THING NEEDED   
 THING;SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS HURT  
 THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL TOO FAR TO  
 GET TO A HOSPITAL.IT WOULD BE A LOT   
 EASIER TO HAVE ONE NEAR US.           
  ROADS NEED TO BE RESURFACED,         
 ESPECIALLY STATION ROAD.POT-HOLES CAN 
 RUIN TYRES.THEY NEED TO BE FILLED IN. 
  THE SCHOOL IS HAVING CHANGES.THE     
 LIBRARY HAS BEEN MOVED AND BOYS AND   
 GIRLS SHOWERS ARE BEING INSTALLED.    
                                       
                                       </content>
