		<title>02Organising Keynsham Carnival</title>
		<content>   Keynsham Carnival took place on the 
 afternoon of Saturday June 8th in     
 1985. The carnival is organised by    
 Keynsham and District Round Table. The
 Round Table is a club which has 30    
 members (there are 1200 Round Tables  
 in the United Kingdom). They try to   
 use their skills and knowledge to help
 the community and have fun doing so.  
   This year there were 40 floats in   
 the procession with about 40 people on
 each float (a float is a decorated    
 lorry). After the procession there was
 a fair in Cadbury's Ground. There were
 bouncy castles and barbecues, car     
 displays and Majorettes etc. There was
 a parachute drop anf The Wurzels (a   
 folk group) performed their music.    
 They raised Â£3000 for local charities 
 and estimated that 5000 people came to
 the carnival. This year was the 11th  
 carnival organised by the Round Table.</content>
