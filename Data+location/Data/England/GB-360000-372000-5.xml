{Bowden, the community policeman.}He   
 has been in the force for 13 years and
 he enjoys his work. He says his job is
 easier now than in the past. It is    
 well paid and there are many          
 policemen.                            
  To become a policeman you need "O"   
 levels, followed by two yeas of       
 training leading to examinations. If  
 you are accepted you serve a period of
 probation. You may also do a four week
 driving course. You will be taught    
 self defence. PC Bowden carries a     
 truncheon and handcuffs at all times. 
  A modern policeman has many tasks. PC
 Bowden has to visit ten local schools 
 regularly. He also deals with matters 
 concerning road safety, Homewatch,    
 juvenile crime and unnatural deaths in
 his area.
