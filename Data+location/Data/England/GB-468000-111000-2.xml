		<title>02TYPICAL HOUSING IN COWPLAIN</title>
		<content> In the main part of the built-up area 
 there are detached,semi-detached and  
 terraced houses.They are of brick     
 construction with tile roofs.There are
 also bungalows,both detached and      
 semi-detached.These are built of the  
 same materials.Most new houses have   
 either garage space or a garage but   
 many of those built before the 1950's 
 have neither. On the edge of the      
 built-up area there are a few houses  
 of stone and stone with wood          
 construction.There are also some shops
 and schools. Further out buildings are
 sparse, it is a country area.There are
 some conventional buildings but also  
 some frame cottages with what we      
 believe are wattle and daub walls and 
 flint walls.Some have thatched roofs. 
 One of them was being rethatched.There
 are a number of pubs,a village hall,a 
 stone manor house and a mission hall. </content>
