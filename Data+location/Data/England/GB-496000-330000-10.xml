		<title>10THE MANOR HOUSE IN BOOTHBY</title>
		<content>    The Norman Manor House in Boothby  
 is the oldest and most  complete      
 building of its kind in England.It was
 built in 1180 of Lincolnshire         
 Limestone and its roof is made of     
 Collyweston Slate.It is 25 feet by 56 
 feet.To the west of the manor the     
 moat.The ground floor consists of 2   
 cellars.Animals were kept in one and  
 wine was made and stored in the       
 other.A flight of stone steps lead up 
 to the first floor which was          
 originally one room.In Tudor times a  
 wall and screen were installed to make
 more rooms,and an extention was       
 built.The ceiling was lowered to make 
 an attic for the servants.            
   Now the manor is not lived in as    
 Boothby Hall was built in the 1630s.
