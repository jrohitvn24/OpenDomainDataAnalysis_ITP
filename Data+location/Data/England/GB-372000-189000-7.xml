		<title>07KINGSWOOD PARISH COUNCIL</title>
		<content>  In Kingswood, the parish council     
 meets at 7.15 sharp on one Monday a   
 month at the old Abbey Gatehouse. They
 are the only people who use the       
 Gatehouse apart from tourists. There  
 are 7 parish councillors whose        
 occupations include: housewives, a    
 retired postmaster, a retired mill    
 worker and farmers. The Parish Council
 has replaced all the old street lights
 in Kingswood . Each street light costs
 Â£368. They also employ people to do   
 jobs: a lady cleans the bus shelters  
 and one of the councillors cuts the   
 grass. The Council have replaced two  
 climbing frame feet and the benches   
 round the village for people to sit   
 on. These benches cost Â£80-Â£90. In    
 Kingswood dogs are a problem because  
 they foul the pavements. The Parish   
 Councillors are very concerned about  
 the mess and try to stop it happening.</content>
