		<title>18HOUSING IN CHARLBURY</title>
		<content>  Charlbury has a very different       
variety of houses,from old Cotswold    
stone to the modern brick houses.The   
houses,which are Cotswold stone, are   
fairly small and have low roofs. They  
take up about half of Charlbury.       
  Modern brick houses are mostly built 
in estates.There are several modern    
estates offering detatched, semi-      
detatched and terraced housing.The     
council estate offers rented housing   
for those who do not wish to own their 
own house.All the estates are built    
out of the town centre and the older   
houses are built in and around the     
town.                                  
  Spelsbury is mainly stone and has    
about three thatched cottages.In       
Chadlington there is a variety of      
housing.In this area there is much     
renovation.
