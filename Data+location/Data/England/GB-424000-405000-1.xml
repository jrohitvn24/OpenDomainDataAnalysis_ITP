		<content> The area we were given to study as our
 contribution to the Domesday survey is
 mainly countryside. We had hoped to   
 be given somewhere close to school but
 in fact the nearest point is about 7  
 miles from school. This caused some   
 transport problems, particularly as   
 due to teacher action it was not as   
 easy to take groups of children out of
 school.                               
 The most northwesterly part of our    
 area is bordered by Denby Dale, to the
 south west are Gunthwaite and         
 Ingbirchworth, and to the east is     
 Cawthorne. There are no major         
 settlements in the area and most of   
 the hamlets are no more than 3 houses.
 We found the study very enjoyable     
 although an area with more industry   
 and housing will probably provide a   
 greater insight into contemporary     
 Britain.                              </content>
