		<title>05THE RIVER OG</title>
		<content> This survey of the{River Og}was       
 carried out at Bay Bridges near       
 Ogbourne Maizey.At this point the     
 river is 36.75cm deep and 8m wide.On  
 the day of the survey the temperature 
 of the river was 15 degrees.The pH    
 value of the river was 7 showing that 
 it is reasonably clean.The river was  
 flowing at a speed of 0.23Km an hour. 
  The Og is a very clear river.There   
 are many{animals}living in it _ we    
 found shrimps,snails and leeches, and 
 saw some fish.We found these animals  
 by  using nets and jars,and looking   
 under weeds and stones.               
  There are many types of{plants}in the
 river.The most commom is canadian pond
 weed,though there are also a lot of   
 reeds and some water cress. Animals   
 like shrimps use the pond to shelter  
 from fish.
