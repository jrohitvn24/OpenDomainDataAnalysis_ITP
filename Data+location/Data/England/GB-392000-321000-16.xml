		<title>16ETHEL AT SCHOOL IN 1900</title>
		<content>Ethel,  born June 19th 1891,  remembers
her schooldays.   The four year olds in
the classroom used slates and slate    
pencils.  Older children, taught in the
big room by Miss Goldsmith,Headmistress
,and pupil teacher, Miss Jones, used   
pens and pencils.   Ethel learned the 3
R's and singing , sewing and scripture.
       Ethel's sewing task for the year
 was to make a nightdress and knit long
 clock patterned rib-topped stockings  
for her six feet tall Headmistress.    
                       Girls wore white
pinafores to protect their school      
clothes.       She disliked pole drill.
Discipline was strict , boys were caned
on their backs , girls on the hand or  
they stayed in after school to write   
lines.                                 
  Ethel left school at 12 years of age.
