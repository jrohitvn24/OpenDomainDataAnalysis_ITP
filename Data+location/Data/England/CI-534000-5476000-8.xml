		<title>08The Fishing Industry</title>
		<content>    Based in St.Peter Port harbour     
 there are about 40 boats varying from 
 seven metres to eighteen metres  in   
 length, the biggest one fishing up to 
 40 miles from Guernsey's coast in up  
 to 80 metres depth.                   
    The industry is based mainly on    
 potting for crabs.                    
    The 2,000 tonnes catch is worth Â£3 
 million and is almost entirely        
 exported: 60% to France, 30% to Spain 
 and 10% to U.K.                       
    A small number of fishermen        
 handline for pollack, longline for    
 conger, bass or flatfish and trawl for
 flatfish.                             
    There are a few divers who fish    
 commercially, mainly for scallops.    
    The industry provides employment   
 for about 200 people.
