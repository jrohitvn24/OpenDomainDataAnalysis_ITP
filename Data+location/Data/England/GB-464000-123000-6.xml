		<content>   A survey in School showed that 90%  
 of fathers and 15% of working mothers 
 worked away from the area. Several of 
 the fathers, such as an architect and 
 an electronics specialist, worked from
 home, visiting their offices only     
 occasionally. Mothers working away    
 included a doctor and a nurse.        
   Local employers include farmers,    
 three shops, two public houses,       
 Westbury House nursing home (domestic 
 work and nursing care), the doctor's  
 surgery, the school and the garage.   
 Private homes provide some domestic   
 service, especially since there are   
 several very large houses in the area.
   "Cottage" industries include a      
 painter, a potter, a hairdresser and a
 lady who has a machine-knitting       
 business.
