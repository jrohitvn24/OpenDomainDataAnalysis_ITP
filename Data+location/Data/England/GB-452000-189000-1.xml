		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO DIDCOT</title>
		<content>Didcot is a small town in the South of 
England.  It is situated in            
Oxfordshire.  There are few shops in   
Didcot,  but they are sufficient for   
the people's needs.  Half-day closing  
is Wednesday.  Didcot has a reasonable 
number of activities, including three  
thriving Drama societies, keepfit,     
ballet, clubs, badminton and dancing.  
Most of these activities are held in   
the Civic Centre.  There is also a     
Youth Centre in which Junior and Senior
residents can hold clubs, discos etc.  
Most inhabitants do not have any       
complaints about their town, but some  
feel it could do with more shops and   
others would like to see more          
facilities for teenagers.  Didcot grew 
in importance partly because of the    
Great Western Railway.  It is an       
expanding town with increasing light   
industry.                              </content>
