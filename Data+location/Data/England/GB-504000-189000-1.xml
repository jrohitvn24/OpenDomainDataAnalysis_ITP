		<title>01THE HAREFIELD AREA-GENERAL</title>
		<content> This area offers a unique opportunity 
 to see the effects of the spread of   
 urban land uses in a rural setting on 
 the edge of Greater London.The village
 of Harefield was never really made    
 part of the expanding railway system  
 of the area and has thus retained its 
 rural identity. It is on a scarp over-
 looking the Colne valley and is       
 surrounded by two major kinds of farm-
 scape - intensively managed grassland 
 and areas of rough grazing.To the     
 edges of the area, woodlands with     
 public access are to be found.The     
 underlying rock is mainly chalk over- 
 lain by gravels and sand.The farming  
 is thus of a mixed nature designed to 
 maximize the agricultural potential of
 the area.
