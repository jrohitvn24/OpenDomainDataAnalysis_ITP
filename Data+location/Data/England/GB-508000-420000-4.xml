		<content> Hawthorne Gardens, founded in 1920,   
 occupies 20 acres of land and is owned
 by Mr Vanden Bos. In 4 acres of       
 greenhouses he grows roses and spray  
 chrysanthemums for sale within a 30   
 mile radius. Each week 13,000 cuttings
 of chrysanthemums are flown in from   
 the Canary Isles. These are rooted    
 under hot moist conditions. After a   
 week they are transplanted. Nature is 
 then fooled using electric lights and 
 black-outs so that the plants have 3  
 weeks of 14 hour days and 10 weeks of 
 14 hour nights to make them flower.   
 The gardens contracted due to an      
 infestation of White Rust Disease, oil
 price increases and high labour and   
 heating costs. In 1956 fifty people   
 were employed - only seven now. The   
 gardens were famous for their tomatoes
 but costs forced the owner to         
 specialise in 2 varieties of flowers. </content>
