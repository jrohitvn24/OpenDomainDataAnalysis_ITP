		<title>05Farming in North Staffs</title>
		<content>Home Farm is in Keele ,which is south- 
west of Newcastle-Under-Lyme.The farm- 
house was built in 1845.There are 280  
acres and the Heath Family have farmed 
there for three generations.           
Mr.Heath's main crop is grass for feed-
ing cattle.He keeps Friesian cows for  
milk and also rears beef-cattle.       
Work begins at 6.30 a.m. and ends at   
5.30 p.m.The cows are milked twice a   
day,early in the morning and late      
afternoon.Mr.Heath takes his holidays  
in April,because winter work has       
finished and summer work has not then  
properly started.                      
The main summer tasks are converting   
grain into hay and silage for winter   
fodder.Also the cows must be milked.   
In winter the cattle are tended        
indoors ,from September to             
March.Mr.Heath employs two full-time   
labourers to help him.                 </content>
