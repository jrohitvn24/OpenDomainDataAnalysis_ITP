		<title>06Guisborough Market</title>
		<content> The market in Guisborough has been    
 held every week since the middle      
 ages.It stretches up Westgate, the    
 main street, for about 300 yards on   
 each side, and on the day I was       
 studying it consisted of about 45     
 stalls. It lasts from 8.30 a.m. until 
 about 5.00 p.m.every Thursday and     
 Saturday. The goods sold include fruit
 &amp; vegetables, meat, clothes, kitchen  
 utensils, bedding and crockery. In    
 summer the market attracts many       
 tourists. One stall-holder selling    
 ladies' garments travelled 350 miles a
 week and went to Knaresborough,       
 Leyburn &amp; Richmond markets as         
 well.Another, selling hankies &amp; window
 leathers, travelled 1,000 miles, &amp;    
 went to Darlington,Stockton, Leyburn, 
 Ripon &amp; Selby.A luggage seller went as
 far as Blyth, Hexham &amp; Morpeth.The    
 market causes much traffic congestion.</content>
