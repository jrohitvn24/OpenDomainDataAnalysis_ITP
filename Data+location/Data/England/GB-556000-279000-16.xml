 80 houses,one church,now also a house,
 a post office,a garage and a village

 crossed by three railway lines with   
 manually operated crossing gates. The 
 houses are brick with slate or        
 corrugated iron roofs.The oldest house
 is 18th Century.150 people live in    
 Adelaide,including 15 children of     
 school age and 12 under 5 years.The   
 children are taken by school bus to   
 St.Etheldreda's Infant School(5-7)    
 St.Mary's Junior School(7-11) and to  
 the City of Ely College(11-18).Only 4
