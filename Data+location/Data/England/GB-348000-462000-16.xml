		<title>16HALTON CHURCH.</title>
		<content>When we went to Halton Church we saw   
that the tower looked much older than  
the rest of the church. This is because
the tower is of Norman age whereas the 
church was rebuilt in 1793 and again   
in 1876. In the graveyard there is a   
sundial which was made in 1635. There  
is also a cross in the churchyard which
has carvings telling a Viking legend   
on two sides, with Christian           
inscriptions on the other two sides.   
Clearly it must date from a time when  
both these cultures were present in the
area. There are fragments of           
Anglo-Saxon crosses preserved inside   
the church. The tower was built in the 
early 14th century. There is only one  
bell which is working in the Church    
and the other two don't work. The      
bells were made in 1956. The oldest    
recognisable gravestone dates from 1611
