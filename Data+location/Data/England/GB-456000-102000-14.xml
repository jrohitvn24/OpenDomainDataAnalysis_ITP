		<content> THIS LAND IS FLAT AND IS HALF OPEN    
 AREA AND HALF URBAN DEVELOPMENT.  OF  
 THE OPEN AREA THERE IA ROUGH          
 RECREATIONAL SPACE AND A FORMAL M.O.D.
 PLAYING FIELD.  THE REMAININ FIELDS   
 ARE USED FOR GRAZING OR CROPS.        
                                       
 THE URBAN AREA IS MOSTLY COUNCIL      
 HOUSING WITH A FEW HOUSES WHICH ARE   
 PRIVATELY OWNED.                      
                                       
 MANY HOUSES HAVE WELL TENDED GARDENS  
 AND SOME HAVE ELABORATE FENCES AND    
 HEDGES.  THERE ARE A FEW OPEN AREAS OF
 GRASS IN FRONT OF SOME HOUSES WHICH   
 THE COUNCIL HAVE LOOKED AFTER AND     
 PLANTED WITH FLOWER BEDS.  SOME GRASS 
 AREAS HAVE BEEN MADE INTO CAR PARKS AS
 THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN THE 1930s    
 WHEN CARS WERE NOT COMMON.            
                                       
                                       </content>
