		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>                                       
   This area is mainly farmland and not
 really used for much else.There are a 
 few villages such as Little Hadham and
 Albury,but the population is not very 
 large.There are not many places of    
 interest,the main one being St. Mary's
 church in Albury.This dates from the  
 13th century.There also used to be a  
 windmill but this was burnt down by   
 its owner due to the cost of its      
 upkeep.                               
                                       
   As said previously,most of the land 
 is used for farming and grazing.Also  
 of importance are the hedges which are
 used by wildlife and these are being  
 destroyed by farmers.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
