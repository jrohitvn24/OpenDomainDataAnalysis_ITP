		<content>     The farmer has been working on    
 Slade  Farm for 30 years he hopes his 
 sons will follow after him.           
    Machinery on this farm now costs   
 more than it did but he still buys    
 some every year. Last year he bought  
 three new tractors and some smaller   
 things like sprayers and ploughs. He  
 uses three different types of tractors
 a John Deere, a Ford and a Massey     
 Ferguson. A combine harvester costs   
 about Â£55,000 to Â£60,000 and weighs   
 about 10 tons.                        
  His list of machinery looks like this
 2 international combines              
 2 bailers, 1 round bailer and 1 square
 14 tractors         10 trailers       
 3 ploughs           6 fertilzers      
 4 cultivators       1 potato harvester
 2 dung spreaders    and much more.    
                                       
                                       </content>
