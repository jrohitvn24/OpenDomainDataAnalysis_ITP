		<title>04INDUSTRY IN NORTH SHEFFIELD</title>
		<content> The industry of the area,{mainly light
{engineering,}follows the course of the
 river. Where factories have closed or 
 houses have been demolished some of   
 the land is derelict and grass        
 covered.At Malin Bridge{an undershot  
{water wheel}remains in working order  
 but the mill is now used as an        
 electrical discount warehouse.        
 Many back to back houses were         
 connected to old factories, many of   
 which are still used for producing    
 similar materials to those they did   
 before, e.g.files,tools,silver platers
 etc. There is{a new industrial estate 
 to the east of Neepsend Lane which    
 houses many small businesses in       
 'lock-up' type accomodation.          
   At the junction of Bradfield Rd. and
 Penistone Rd.there are{two large heavy
{engineering works,}one of which still 
 has{a drop forge}audible from afar.   </content>
