		<title>03RECORD OF CATTERICK-TUNSTALL</title>
		<content> This area is steeped in history.      
 Indeed Catterick is mentioned in the  
 original Domesday book, its given name
 being Catrik. It is not unusual for a 
 farmer to unearth some relic of the   
 past and archaeologists are regular   
 visitors. In square twelve of this    
 block there is a Tumulas - a Roman    
 burial ground. Brough Hall dates back 
 to the Norman Conquest. It was the    
 home of the De burg family and in turn
 the Lawson family. When Sir Ralph     
 Lawson Bart died the hall was sold to 
 a building contractor who has since   
 divided it into flats and furbished   
 them in keeping with present day      
 lifestyle. The origins of Tunstall are
 also mentioned in the Domesday book.  
 The village has changed very little   
 over the generations, the passing of  
 time making very little impression on 
 it.                                   </content>
