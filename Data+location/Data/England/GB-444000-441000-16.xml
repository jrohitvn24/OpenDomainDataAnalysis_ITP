		<content> There are three{schools}in Tadcaster. 
 Two of them are Junior Schools with an
 Infant Department and the third is the
 Comprehensive School called Tadcaster 
 Grammar School which is just outside  
 the town at Toulston. It is a big     
 school and offers a good{education.}A{
{uniform}is worn which is black, blue  
 and white, the girls wearing black or 
 blue skirts and the boys blue or grey 
 trousers with white or blue shirts.   
 Most children do not like wearing     
 uniform but I think it is a good idea 
 as some children might wear outrageous
 clothes and hairstyles. Also in       
 Tadcaster is an{Adult Education}Centre
 which teaches typing, sewing,         
 lacemaking, cooking and woodwork.
