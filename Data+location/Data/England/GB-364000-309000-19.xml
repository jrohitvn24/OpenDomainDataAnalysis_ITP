		<content>{ 1 Rambling                           
 Walking has become an increasingly    
 popular hobby in the 1980's.Rambling  
 groups have been set up,mainly in     
 urban areas,encouraging people to get 
 out into the open air and make use of 
 the available foot-paths(many of which
 are old pack horse trails  and        
 railways).The pastime has been given  
 further support by recent medical     
 evidence linking heart disease with a 
 lack of regular exercise.             
{ 2 Wine Making                        
 Much of the increase in home brewing  
 has no doubt been caused by higher    
 prices of commercially produced wine. 
 This,however,overlooks the            
 satisfaction which can be gained from 
 this hobby.Considerable patience is   
 required for optimum results,         
 contrasting pleasantly with the speed 
 and pressures of modern day life.     </content>
