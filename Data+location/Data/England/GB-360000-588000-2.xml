		<title>02LEWIS BURN : CONSERVATION</title>
		<content> The{Lewis Burn}flows into the Kielder 
 Reservoir just beyond the bounds of   
 this "D-Block". The Burn has been     
 designated as a conservation area, and
 as a nature reserve with a special    
 purpose. {Otters}used to be a common  
 sight in the area, but became quite   
 rare. It is hoped to encourage the    
 creatures to populate the banks of the
 Lewis Burn, and indeed they have now  
 begun to make their homes in the area,
 and can occasionally be seen on the   
 mud-banks at the Burns's edge.        
{ A picnic-site}has been created for   
 visitors. It may be used as the base  
 for forest walks,or simply to enjoy   
 the peace and quiet of the area.
