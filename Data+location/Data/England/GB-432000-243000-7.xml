		<content> More unusual birds include one/two    
 pairs of curlew nesting each year on  
 Burland and wild duck can be seen near
 the streams.                          
 In 1985 some snow fell in January and 
 February. The first four months of the
 year had average rainfall, but May and
 June were wet, making work on the     
 farms difficult. July and August were 
 average, but the wet ground made      
 harvesting difficult. In September and
 October the weather improved, with    
 less rain and higher temperatures.
