		<content> The River Medina which runs through   
 the middle of the area has been       
 canalised below Shide meadow. It      
 carries a heavy load of topsoil       
 following heavy rains,but it does not 
 appear otherwise badly polluted,though
 it must carry pesticide and fertilizer
 run off.                              
  There are 3 sites of interest in the 
 area.Carisbrooke Castle has grounds   
 which are mown but not sprayed and are
 botanically rich.The same is true of  
 Mountjoy Cemetery.Shide Pit a former  
 chalk pit is a {Site of Special       
{Scientific Interest}and is showing    
 early stages of development of chalk  
 grassland.Tree growth is well         
 developed on the S.facing slope but in
 early stages on the others.           
    There is also a{bat roost}in the   
 former Newport to Sandown railway     
 tunnel.                               </content>
