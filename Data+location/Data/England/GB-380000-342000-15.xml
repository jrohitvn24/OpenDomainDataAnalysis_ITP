		<content> One game that is played in the        
playgroun  nd is called ball. There    
are two teams. One team starts off with
the ball which has to be passed between
that team. The next team has to try and
catch the ball. Sometimes a group of   
passing boys might catch the ball. If  
this happens then the two teams in our 
game join together, until the ball has 
been caught. We start the game again.  
 Another game which is played out of   
school is hedgehopping. Somebody dares 
you to run down the road hopping over  
all the hedges. If they are too tall   
you try and burst through them. This   
bit is okay it's just when you have to 
run back up the same road, hop through 
the same hedges and burst through the  
same hedges. This time the people are  
ready for you.
