		<content> There are aproximately 330 people     
 over 18 in Sampford Courtney village  
 and the surrounding area.The village  
 Post Office pays out nearly seventy   
 old age Pensions and only eleven      
 Family allowances.                    
  Sampford,as one of the areas 'pretty 
 villages' is not a cheap place to buy 
 a house or to live.As cottages come   
 onto the market,or are converted from 
 old farm buildings,they are usually   
 bought by retired people.These people 
 like the village as it is,and as it is
 also a conservation area,anybody      
 wanting to alter anything structural  
 will find'the village' against the    
 proposals.There are very few of the   
 original families left.However,the    
 majority of the inhabitants are very  
 eager to help with 'Village           
 activities'such as Britain in Bloom   
 comp. and the Church Fete.            </content>
