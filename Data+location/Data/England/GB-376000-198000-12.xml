  Uley School consisted of one building
 divided into five classrooms.The hall 
 was one classroom,classroom 2 was     
 was divided in half with a partition  
 and a curtain divided classroom 1.If  
 it was raining when the children got  
 to school they would shelter in two   
 wooden sheds.In these sheds coal and  
 wood was sometimes stored.Every       
 morning the caretaker would fill the  
 iron stoves in each classroom with    
 fuel.The toilets were outside,the boys
 in the top yard and the girls in the  
 bottom yard.If it was too far to go   
 home for lunch the children brought   
 sandwiches.Their work was very        
 difficult and at the end of each term 
 all the work was sent off to be       
 marked.The Headmaster did all the     
 secretarial work himself and sometimes
 used the cane.                        </content>
