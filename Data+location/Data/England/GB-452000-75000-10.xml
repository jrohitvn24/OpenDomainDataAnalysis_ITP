		<title>10Steephill  Cove</title>
		<content> Steephill cove is a natural,small cove
 with a nice sandy beach.{The Blake and
{Spencer Families}continue the long    
 established family fishing business   
 from here.The fishing boat'Compromise'
 built by the Blakes was launched in   
 Dec.84.This may possibly be the last  
 wooden boat to be built since the elm 
 and spruce timbers are unobtainable.  
{Compromise}was also used this year in 
 the rescue of the pilot and passengers
 from the light aircraft which crashed 
 into the sea near Ventnor pier.When   
 Mr.Blake,an Auxillary Coastguard, got 
 the emergency call,'Compromise' was on
 the scene within seconds. The newly   
 installed radio was used to alert the 
 helicopter rescue team of the serious 
 condition of a baby.This prompt action
 resulted in the baby being admitted to
 Hasler Naval Hospital,Southampton     
 within sixteen minutes.               </content>
