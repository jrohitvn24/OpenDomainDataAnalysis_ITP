		<title>16Mistley Port</title>
		<content> Manningtree (with Mistley) is still a 
 small river port and agricultural     
 centre. Its golden age lasted from    
 1705, when the Stour was made         
 navigable to Sudbury, down to the     
 coming of the railway in 1848. Coal   
 was imported from Newcastle and timber
 from Norway. Wagons would queue to    
 discharge their corn and other        
 agricultural produce for London; the  
 ships would return with mixed cargoes 
 including dung from London Stables.   
 There was also a fair amount of ship  
 building.
