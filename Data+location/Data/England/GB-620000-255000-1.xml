  The area under review is typical of  
much of East Anglia in that it is an   
area of predominantly arable farming.  
Although the square contains the       
village of Otley itself the overall    
pattern remains agricultural.The farms 
are typical in that the farmers produce
crops which reflect the current        
subsidies available.Generally speaking 
the crops are a mixture of             
barley,beans,oilseed rape,wheat etc.   
  The local people are a close knit    
group with mutual interests.Not        
surprisingly the pattern of education  
is of great concern,equally important  
is retaining the character of the area.
  Of current interest is a proposal to 
amend the pattern of education by      
replacing a three tier system with a   
two tier pattern                       
                                       </content>
