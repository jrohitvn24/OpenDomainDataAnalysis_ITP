		<content> Mr. Hall works for Colonel Stanton    
 as a gamekeeper.When breeding         
 pheasants he puts the eggs firstly    
 into the incubator two hundred in     
 each tray.When they have been in for  
 two or three weeks he takes them out  
 and puts them in a crisp box until    
  they are about five weeks old.       
 They are then put into the pens that  
  are made for them and live there     
 till they are fully grown,then they   
 go into the woods.When the chicks     
 are in the pen they eat pellets from  
 a bowl under a shelter and they drink 
 water.They flint grit,that is there   
 teeth,because it cuts up the food     
 they eat.The Colonel organises the    
 shoots,but the gamekeeper makes the   
 places to shoot from Mr.Hall has got  
 three dogs,two geese,four hens and    
 five sheep.
