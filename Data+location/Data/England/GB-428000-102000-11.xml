		<title>11A Shopping Survey</title>
		<content> A survey was made of people shopping  
 in the two main shopping areas of     
 Brockenhurst. Of the people           
 interviewed 60 were visitors and 45   
 were locals. 65 people thought that   
 the large influx of visitors made     
 shopping more difficult in the summer 
 but most agreed that the tourists     
 helped to provide a better range of   
 shops. 70 of the people questioned    
 found Brockenhurst a very expensive   
 place to shop but preferred paying a  
 bit extra than travelling to Lymington
 or Lyndhurst. Most people did their   
 main weekly shopping in Lymington     
 although 16 do travel regularly to    
 Southampton. 22 of the shoppers visit 
 the hypermarket at Eastleigh on       
 occassions.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
