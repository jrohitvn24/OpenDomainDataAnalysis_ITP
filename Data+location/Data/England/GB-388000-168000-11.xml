		<title>11Lacock Spring Fair</title>
		<content> The{Spring Fair}was  in Lacock and    
 there were{maypole dancers}in the     
 playground.  All the teachers         
 organised it and the money was for the
{school fund.} There was a{horse race  
 out of chairs and you had to throw a  
 rubber dice and if your horse was the 
 number that the dice rolled on then   
 your horse had to move one square.    
 The horse that finished first won 30p.
 If you wanted to have a go it was 20p.
 The{Spring Fair}is held every year.   
 There are some{stalls}with books  and 
 plants and things.  There was a table 
 with a{bottle of sweets}and you had to
 guess how many sweets were in the     
 bottle.  Lisa Gainey won them all     
 because she guessed the amount of     
 sweets there were.
