		<content>  The Youth Club in Pateley is run by  
 three paid adult leaders and two      
 voluntary helpers. It is attended by  
 young people between the ages of      
 fifteen and twenty years. Usually     
 between fifty and seventy people      
 attend each week. They pay Â£1 per year
 for membership and 20p per session.Non
 members pay 25p per session. There are
 three rooms for their use. These were 
 the craft rooms of the former         
 secondary school. The Club offers     
 table-tennis, darts, pool and also has
 a colour television. The members      
 organise discos and often play five-a-
 side football at the Sports Centre.   
 Craftwork is another activity offered 
 to the young people. There is also a  
 dark room where they are about to     
 start doing photography. The Club is  
 open every Monday, Tuesday and        
 Thursday evening from 7.30pm to 10pm. </content>
