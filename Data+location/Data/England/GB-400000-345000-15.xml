		<title>15The Local History of Whiston</title>
		<content>  1920s. The doctor came out to Whiston
by horse and trap. The lanes which were
roads for the villagers were very busy 
with horses and carts going down to    
Froghall station with milk in churns   
which were loaded on to trains. In the 
1930s a bus service started on         
Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays which
went to Leek and then on to Cheadle.   
  Mr Harrison, when interviewed, said  
it seemed to snow more often in the    
past than now. In 1947 the snow was up 
to the telegraph poles. There were no  
bread deliveries so people had to walk 
to Cheadle to fetch sacks of loaves.   
  In the school there were dances on   
Saturday nights and concert parties.   
An agricultural show had a Queen and   
attracted many people to the village.
