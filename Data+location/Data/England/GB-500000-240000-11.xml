		<content> There is very little for the children 
 to do as no clubs or activities are   
 organised. There is a swimming pool   
 which is not always open.             
 The houses are ideal for a family of  
 four or five. They used to belong to  
 the brick works but now they have been
 put up for sale. This is a very good  
 opportunity for first time buyers and 
 families with young children because  
 the houses are quite cheap. There are 
 also two schools in the area and      
 mother and toddler groups.            
 The retired people in the village are 
 well looked after. They have          
 comfortable bungalows and a large hall
 where games are played and ladies can 
 have their hair done. There are often 
 trips to well known places and there  
 is a small but friendly Church. There 
 is little chance of the old people    
 feeling lonely.                       </content>
