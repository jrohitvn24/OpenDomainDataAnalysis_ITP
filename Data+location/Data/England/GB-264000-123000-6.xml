		<content>{Grid Ref. 0265.7' 0125.8'             
{Mile End House}was thatched in 1985 by
 Maynard Westcott and two sons.They    
 work from Chittlehampton.All the old  
 thatch was cleared and burnt.The first
 layer is tied on as it cannot be      
 nailed.It also makes it easier to bang
 in the stakes which are made of Hazel 
 wood which is split.The straw is made 
 of wheat (special Wheat). The thatcher
 uses a special tool to pat down the   
 straw.The special name for Wheat straw
 is Reed .The tool is called a beater  
 it has diagonal groves in it .A sikle 
 is used to neaten up the loose        
 edges.When the straw is in place the  
 thatcher bangs in the stakes with a   
 wooden mallet .The thatchers are paid 
 100 pounds a week .Each layer of Reeds
 is held in place by a rope made of    
 Reeds wound together,held in place    
 with Hazel crooks.                    </content>
