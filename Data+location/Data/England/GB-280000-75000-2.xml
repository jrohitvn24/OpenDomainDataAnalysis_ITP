		<content>     My name is{Gerald Martin.}I am    
 divorced and am bringing up 2 of my 3 
 children on my own. I get up at 6.30am
 and exercise my 2 dogs in the nearby  
 fields . I return home at 7.00am and  
 wake my children and get our          
 breakfast. Once the children are ready
 for school i leave the house and walk 
 to work . I work as a {carpenter and  
{joiner}at{Seale Hayne Agricultural    
{College.}I have a very varied and     
 enjoyable job maintaining the wooden  
 buildings and furniture. I work from  
 8.00am untill 1.00pm and from 1.30pm  
 until 4.30pm. The children are        
 already home when I arrive and we make
 and have tea. The children change into
 their play clothes and I wash the     
 breakfast,lunch and tea things; dry   
 and clear away.Some days we also do   
 washing,ironing and shopping.So my    
 days are long,varied,full and happy.  </content>
