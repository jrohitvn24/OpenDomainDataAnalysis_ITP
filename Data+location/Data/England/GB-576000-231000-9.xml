    On Wednesday May 7th we went to the
{Fire Station}which was opened in 1969.
 It houses an H.C.B. Angus Rescue Pump 
{Fire Engine.}This engine can carry 400
 gallons of water and travel up to 70  
 m.p.h. It is only five years old.     
    Last year there were 160 fires. The
{Leading Fireman}said that the biggest 
 fire that they have attended was at   
 Woolworth's store in Sudbury.         
    They cover an area in North Essex  
 as far as the Suffolk border.         
    The{Fire Station}is 20metres by 10 
 metres. There is only 1 engine and it 
 is manned by 9{firemen,}they are only 
 part time{firemen.}They are contacted 
 by H.Q. on a 'bleeper'and they have to
 run to the{station}to get the engine  
 ready. The message about the fire is  
 recorded on a tape recorder and gives 
 instructions obout where the fire is. </content>
