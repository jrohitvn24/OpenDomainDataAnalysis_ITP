		<title>02A WORSBROUGH LEGEND</title>
		<content> The legend of the{Blue Lady}has       
 existed in this area for as long as   
 anyone can remember.  The Blue Lady is
 said to haunt Worsbrough in search of 
 her long-lost lover.  She haunts      
 places like{Kingwell Woods},the       
 reservoir and even{Stainborough}.The  
 Blue Lady lived at the time of the    
{Civil War}.Her lover was a Cavalier   
 soldier and she helped the Cavaliers  
 escape from the{Roundheads}through a  
 tunnel, by leaving a light in the     
 window of her house when it was safe  
 to go through.  At last she was killed
 because of this. It was said that gold
 was hidden in the tunnel that the     
 soldiers used and some men once went  
 there looking for it but they were    
 scared by the sound of marching and   
 ran away.  The ghost of the Blue Lady 
 moves slowly and leaves a blue path   
 wherever she goes.                    </content>
