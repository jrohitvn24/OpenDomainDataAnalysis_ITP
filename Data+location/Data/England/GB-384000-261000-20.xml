		<title>20The Village of Salwarpe</title>
		<content>  The village of Salwarpe is mentioned 
 in the original{Domesday Book.}The    
 name is derived from "seal" meaning   
 salt and "weorpen" meaning to tow a   
 boat. The village consists of 23      
{houses,}many of which are over 100    
 years old, a modern{rectory,}and a    
{Village Hall,}built by the villagers  
 in the early 1970's. The Hall is used 
 by many organisations, including the  
 W.I.,Dog Training,Youth Club,etc. The 
{Droitwich Barge Canal,}built by James 
 Brindley in 1771, runs through the    
 village. After many years of disuse,  
 it has been dredged and restored      
 recently and is now navigable from    
 Droitwich to Ladywood. Close by the   
 canal is{Salwarpe Court,}a 16th       
 Century half-timbered manor house of  
 great historical interest. The        
 original owner of the Court was       
 Catherine of Aragon.                  </content>
