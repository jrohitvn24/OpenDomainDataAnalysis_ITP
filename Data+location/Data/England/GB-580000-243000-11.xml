		<content>   Since this is International Youth   
 Year, Essex put on a spectacular show 
 of what young people can do. The back-
 drop was an enormous map of the County
 made by the Primary schools and we did
 four sections showing Pentlow Tower,  
 the school with a fox in front, Lyston
 Mill and so on. We used dye paint and 
 ironed it when it was dry.            
   Although it meant getting back very 
 late Mr Finch took the Fourth Year in 
 his car with Mrs Todd.  We left at 4.0
 and did a sightseeing tour - St Paul's
 Cathedral floodlit, The Embankment and
 Parliament Square. The show began 7.30
   Our seats were near the organ and we
 never did see the map;they let it down
 and displayed art students' work after
 the interval!  The show was fabulous -
 dancing, singing, bands, orchestra... 
 For the return journey we were all put
 to sleep - except Mr Finch of course. </content>
