		<content> In 1984 our school was 150 years old  
 and we all dressed up as they did at  
 that time. We even had an             
 old-fashioned meal.                   
   There are 69 children. We have two  
 playgrounds, one for football, and the
 other for other games. We also have a 
 big meadow.                           
   Every year we have a Sports Day, a  
 Carol Service, a concert and other    
 events.                               
   We have three classrooms and three  
 teachers. Their names are Mrs Price,  
 Mr Moult and Miss Bauers. In Mr       
 Moult's class the age is 5-7. In Mrs  
 Price's class the age is 7-9. In Miss 
 Bauers' class the age is 9-11.        
   We wear red jumpers for our uniform 
 with red and white checked dresses for
 girls in the summer.
