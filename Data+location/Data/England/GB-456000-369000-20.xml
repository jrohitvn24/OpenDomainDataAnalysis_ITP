 receive all the children of school age
 in Meden Vale _then called Welbeck    
 Colliery Village.Later children of    
 secondary school age were transferred 
 to secondary modern school in nearby  
 Warsop.Eastlands took all 5_11year old
 children until 1966 when the          
 neighbouring Netherfield Infant School
 was built.Eastlands roll was once 250 
 _300 children but is at present 140.  
 The building has 8 rooms_5 teaching   
 areas,1 parents'room,a library and a  
 craft room.Netherfield had 65 on roll 
 to begin with and now has 85 plus 60  
 children in the Nursery which was     
 built about 7 years ago just after a  
 fire destroyed part of the building.

 schools stay at school for dinner.The 
 Junior School has 2 Gym Clubs,a Craft
