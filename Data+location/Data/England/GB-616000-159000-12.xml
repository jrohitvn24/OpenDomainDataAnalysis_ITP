		<content>  This plant operates every day each   
year and serves a population of 44,200 
people and eight industries from the   
City of Canterbury and the outlying    
areas of Blean, Broadoak, Fordwich,    
Sturry, Tyler Hill and parts of        
Thanington.                            
  The main problem here in 1985 is the 
smell from the sludge which is piled in
long columns 10-12 feet high, 80 yards 
long in rows of up to 10. Limes and    
polymers are added to this sludge which
is then covered with straw until over  
the years it decomposes and can be used
by local farmers. A very primitive wild
deodourizing agent is sprayed into the 
air to kill the smell of gases produced
at this stage of treatment. In the hot 
summers they are not very effective and
according to wind direction most of the
area suffers from these foul odours.
