over the level of unemployment,        
Stowmarket offers more job             
opportunities than many other towns. In
June 1985 8.9% of the population was   
unemployed compared with a national    
figure of 13.2%. Of those unemployed   
545 were male and 352 female.The most  
commonly sought job among the men was  
van driving but demand from employers  
for this kind of work was low. Some at 
least of the unemployed were prepared  
to accept almost any kind of work. The 
unemployment figures were expected to  
show a seasonal rise as school leavers 
entered the job market but this upward 
move is modified by the fact that many 
16 year olds either enter sixth forms, 
or go to Suffolk College or  Youth     
Training Schemes. Older people have    
most difficulty in finding jobs.Main   
employers are I.C.I                    </content>
