		<content>  The village hall is a former school  
 which was originally provided by the  
 Kenyon-Slaney family. The village hall
 committee purchased it in 1983 for    
 Â£5000 with the help of a grant from   
 Bridgnorth Council. It is used for    
 meetings of the Parish Council, keep  
 fit class, dog club and Women's       
 Institute and can be hired for special
 occasions.                            
  The Women's Institute is involved in 
 most of the village's social          
 activities and organises a Christmas  
 party. Other annual events include an 
 autumn fair, a bonfire party, a       
 meeting of the Albrighton Hunt and a  
 Boxing Day walk. There are also coffee
 mornings, cheese and wine evenings and
 car treasure hunts. The money raised  
 is donated to charity.                
  The Masons' Arms public house was re-
 opened in July 1985 after renovation. </content>
