		<content> In an area marked by a number of large
 affluent households many horses are   
 kept and riding is popular. There are 
 several private swimming pools and    
 tennis courts. Residents wishing to   
 play football, cricket, badminton and 
 tennis can do so in nearby villages.  
 The nearest towns, East Grinstead and 
 Haywards Heath are well provided with 
 public sports facilities and leisure  
 centres as well as first class        
 rugby,tennis,hockey, cricket and      
 squash clubs. Archery is practised at 
 Highbrook and angling in the Horsted  
 lakes.The many well sign-posted       
 footpaths maintained by local parish  
 councils make walking a popular       
 pastime and the local scenery also    
 attracts visitors to the area.
