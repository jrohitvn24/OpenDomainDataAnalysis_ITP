		<title>09CHANGE IN THE KEIGHLEY AREA</title>
		<content> The old mill at {Goose Eye }was       
 originally part of{Keighley's}textile 
 industry.However falling demand forced
 its closure.Unlike other mills it was 
 not demolished or left to stand idle, 
 instead it now serves a different     
 purpose.Part of it has been turned    
 into a nightclub and disco whilst in  
 another part {Goose Eye Ales}are      
 brewed.This shows the change from old 
 style manufacturing industry to growth
 industries like leisure.              
   At{Oakworth}the{Keighley and Worth  
{Valley Railway}has a station. This is 
 a working railway of about 5 miles    
 length.Although this feature has not  
 changed its use it now carries mainly 
 tourists and visitors to {Haworth.    
 Again what was formerly of use to the 
 manufacturing industry of the area has
 been adapted to serve the needs of the
 leisure industry.                     </content>
