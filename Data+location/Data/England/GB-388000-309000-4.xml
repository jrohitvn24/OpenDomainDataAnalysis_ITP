		<content> SOCIAL CONCERNS-YOUTH FACILITIES      
  Parents think that the area they live
 in is safe and healthy for children   
 because it is in the country.They also
 think that more money should be spent 
 on more facilities for the young,to   
 take up their time,either in playing  
 sport in a sports centre or getting to
 know other people in a youth club.    
  The one point many people make is    
 that their area should not be         
 overcrowded because they love it as it
 is.
