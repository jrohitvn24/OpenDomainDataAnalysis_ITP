		<title>08Pets: My Cat</title>
		<content>{A cat} is a fur covered mammal with   
four legs, two pointed ears and a tail.
I have three cats, two are ginger      
coloured one is black with a white tuft
under its chin. My cats feed on tinned 
food, their favourite flavour is turkey
They also like chicken scraps and fish 
They sometimes scratch me when I open  
tins for them they sometimes fight over
the food. At night they lie on our beds
or they go out for a run, sometimes    
they stay out all night. During the day
day they usually lie in the shade or in
the flower bed or in the big plant     
pots. They like to lie under the logan-
berry bush in our garden.
