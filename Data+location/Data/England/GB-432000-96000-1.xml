		<content> The block contains 2 villages,Pilley  
 and S.Baddesley,2 hamlets,Portmore and
 Norley Wood,several farms,1 river,3   
 ponds, a few streams,commonland,      
 heathland,woods,a church,2 chapels,4  
 schools,1 Post Office,tumuli,2 private
 parks and a small corner of a housing 
 estate.There is no industry (by a     
 hairsbreadth) but in this decade at   
 least we have a fairly high employment
 level in nearby towns and factories.  
 Market gardening, farming,and forestry
 work is also available and there is a 
 large but active retired population.  
 There are 2 state Primary schools and 
 2 private schools which all enjoy a   
 high reputation.Modern amenities are  
 few but there is a Post Office,a      
 general shop,a pub,2 village halls and
 good access roads and finally,miles of
 beautiful open forest land.
