		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content>    This block is an orderly patchwork 
 of gently sloping fields, hedgerows   
 and small woodlands situated between  
{Nuneaton (Warks) and Hinckley (Leics).
    The land is mainly farmed, and at  
 its highest elevation lies the village
 of{Higham-on-the-Hill,}the birthplace 
 of a former{Archbishop of Canterbury,}
 the{Rev. Geoffrey Francis Fisher,}who 
 died in 1972.                         
    This area has become more generally
 known since the development of The    
{Motor Industry Research Association   
{(MIRA),}which is situated on the north
 side of{The Watling Street}- now the  
 A5, a major artery in the present-day 
 trunk road system.                    
    The large Country Houses bordering 
 this section of the A5 have been      
 adapted for communal, business or     
 hospital use.{The Ashby Canal}cuts    
 through the block's eastern boundary. </content>
