		<content> Luddington primary school was opened  
 in 1975 and replaced the two schools  
 at Luddington and Garthorpe as a      
 result of falling rolls. The number   
 on roll at its opening was 71 the     
 present number of pupils is 51. There 
 are 3 members of staff including the  
 headmistress. A nursery class is held 
 2 half days a week.                   
 These 51 children come from 39        
 families. As part of the work done for
 the project a survey was made of      
 various modern items of equipment     
 possessed by each family. All the     
 families have a cooker, washer, radio 
 and television. 38 families have a    
 refrigerator, 31 have a freezer, 29   
 have a telephone, 18 have a video     
 recorder, 7 have a computer, 10 have a
 microwave oven, 28 have a music centre
 and 33 have a car.
