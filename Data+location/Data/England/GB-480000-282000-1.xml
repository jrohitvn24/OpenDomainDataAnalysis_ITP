		<content>  The survey block contains one large  
 settlement,{Desborough,}a small       
 village called{Rushton}and the rest of
 the land is mainly used for farming.  
  Desborough as a settlement has       
 several churches, a ballroom          
 restaurant, two schools, a library, a 
 fire station, leisure centre and      
 several public houses.  Rushton is a  
 smaller settlement and its attraction,
 according to the people who live      
 there, is that it is a peaceful       
 settlement.                           
  We found out that 3 people out of 5  
 in Desborough would rather live in    
 Rushton. In Rushton there is a blind  
 school. Rushton has a big village hall
 in the centre.{
