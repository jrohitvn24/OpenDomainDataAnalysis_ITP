		<title>01Laughton Area Summary</title>
		<content> Our area is mostly agricultural with  
 some woodland. The settlements are    
 small villages with closely knit      
 communities. The majority of people   
 were born in the area but increasingly
 more newcomers are arriving. People   
 from large cities in the vicinity,    
 particularly Sheffield find the area  
 attractive because of its rural nature
 and lower rates. Entertainment is not 
 very sophisticated, consisting mainly 
 of pubs, dancing clubs, bingo, sports 
 clubs and riding. The area is rich in 
 history with many old churches and a  
 12th century abbey. Farming is        
 important and there is a farm museum. 
 On the whole this is a pleasant rural 
 area with attractive villages. The    
 landscape is made more attractive by  
 the large amounts of mature deciduous 
 trees, often growing in               
 stream-bottomed valleys.              </content>
