		<content> Most houses in this area have         
 telephones and television sets.       
 Radios are common.  The local radio   
 station is County Sound broadcasting  
 from Guildford.                       
                                       
 Postal deliveries to the house are at 
 least once daily and in this area are 
 fairly reliable.                      
 Postal collections have decreased over
 the years.  In the outlying districts 
 such as this there is no collection   
 between Saturday 0913 and Monday 0915.
 Usually post is collected morning and 
 evening.                              
 There are 3 post boxes in squares     
 10-2, 12-1, 2-1                       
 There is no post office in this area. 
                                       
 There is only one public telephone box
 in square 10.
