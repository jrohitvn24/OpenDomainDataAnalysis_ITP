		<content> 4 conservation sub-areas, 3 of        
 which fall into the grid.These areas  
 are set aside as being of special     
 architectural interest and national   
 importance.                           
   Within the first area some of the   
 buildings have an unusual design,     
 characteristic of the 1930's.  This   
 estate was never completed as a result
 of the advent of World War Two and    
 therefore is of special interest.This 
 area also contains a 'modern' group of
 housing by a well known 30's          
 architect.This area marks the border  
 between Frinton and Walton.           
   The area inside 'the gates' (Frinton
 itself was not developed until        
 1886) contains 2 hotels, neo-Tudor    
 housing and crescents of a typical    
 Edwardian style which benefit from    
 attractive sea-views.
