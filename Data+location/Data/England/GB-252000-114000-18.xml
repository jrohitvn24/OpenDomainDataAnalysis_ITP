		<title>18NORTHCOTT BARTON, NR BEAFORD</title>
		<content>   Northcott Barton is the name of our 
 farmhouse. It is 3 miles from Beaford,
 3 miles from dolton and 8 miles from  
 Torrington. Its age is not known but  
 there was a settlement here in the    
 thirteenth century.  The dining room  
 has two beams stretching right across 
 the room.  The ceiling is coated with 
 limewash which makes it hard to paper.
 The house is made of cob, stone and   
 some bricks, and was thatched before  
 the present tiled roof was installed. 
 The house is a Devonshire Longhouse.  
 Above the living room was the granary 
 where corn was once ground.  Some of  
 our barns date back to the first      
 Elizabeth. At the back of the house is
 a room called the pumphouse, which    
 once supplied the water, but the pump 
 no longer exists. Northcott means     
 north of the wood, and near the house 
 is Arson Wood.                        </content>
