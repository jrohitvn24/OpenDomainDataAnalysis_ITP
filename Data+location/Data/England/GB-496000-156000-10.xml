		<title>10GOLDSWORTH PARK, WOKING</title>
		<content> Goldsworth Park,which is the largest  
 housing development in Britain and is 
 probably the largest in Europe,is soon
 to be completed.The 4,000th home is   
 expected to be finished during the    
 Autumn of 1986.                       
 The land on which the development is  
 built was bought from Walter S.Slocock
 Ltd.in the early 1970's.Until that    
 time,the whole area had been a very   
 flourishing Nursery Garden which had  
 specialized in the Goldsworth range of
 Azaleas and Rhododendrons.            
 The land had to be drained and a 17   
 acre lake was created in the middle of
 the area.This is now being developed  
 as a water sport amenity.             
 Goldsworth Park has become a mini-new 
 -town with its own schools,shops,pub, 
 health centre and leisure centre.     
 The Basingstoke Canal which forms the 
 southern boundary is being restored.  </content>
