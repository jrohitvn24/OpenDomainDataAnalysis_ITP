		<title>08SEACROFT HOUSING ESTATE</title>
		<content> The Seacroft Housing Estate is one of 
 the newer estates in Leeds.  Planned  
 in the late 1930's it was built in the
 late 1940's. The houses were in the   
 main semi-detached with the planners  
 aiming to create space for living. The
 tower blocks of flats were added later
 in the mid 1960's, when it was felt   
 that space could be saved by building 
 upwards.Most people housed there were 
 brought from the south of Leeds where 
 much of the housing was Victorian. The
 estate now suffers from many of the   
 problems of a large estate, and       
 vandalism from graffiti to broken     
 windows is frequent. This             
 generalisation is not common to all   
 the estate as there are also those    
 houses with standards equal to many   
 parts of Leeds. Growth of a community 
 spirit is attempting to curb some of  
 the worst excesses.                   </content>
