		<title>13SHOPPING IN THE SAMPFORDS</title>
		<content> In this area there are no shops.      
 Sometimes a van comes round to        
 deliver the bread or sell groceries.  
 However, the inhabitants of this      
 rectangle mostly have to come into the
 centre of the village of Great        
 Sampford.  One shop is there which    
 opens every day and sells all sorts of
 things.  There is a garage and a      
 hairdressers here too.  However, the  
 people usually travel into the larger 
 towns of Haverill or Saffron Walden to
 get their shopping.  In these towns   
 are supermarkets and other kinds of   
 shops which sell clothes, shoes and   
 books, etc.  Cambridge is within easy 
 travelling distance and many people   
 like to shop there.  All of these     
 towns hold a market once a week and   
 many people enjoy the jolly           
 atmosphere.  Also often produce is    
 cheaper.                              </content>
