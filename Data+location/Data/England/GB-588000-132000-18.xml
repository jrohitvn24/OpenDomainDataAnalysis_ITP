		<title>18FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> I used to live in London and when my  
 job moved to Ashford my family and I  
 bought a house in Tenterden because it
 is a nice quiet place to live and     
 there is no trouble on the streets.  I
 am pleased we moved out of London and 
 my children can grow up in the country
 away from the drugs and gangs of      
 layabouts.  There are good schools in 
 Tenterden and it is safe for the      
 children to go out on their own. It is
 a  really clean place with flowers and
 trees everywhere.  At Christmas there 
 are fairy lights in the trees along   
 the High Street, all the shops are    
 decorated and the church tower is     
 floodlit. It looks just like a        
 Christmas card. In the winter we tend 
 to stay at home and watch a video and 
 maybe have a Chinese or Indian        
 take-away.  In the summer we go out in
 the car to the seaside.               </content>
