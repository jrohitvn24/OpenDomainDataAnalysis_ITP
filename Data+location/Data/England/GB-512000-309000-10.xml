		<title>10THE FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> The Market Deeping Fire Station was   
 built in approximately 1974.It employs
 13 part-time firemen and they         
 deal with 70 to 80 calls a year,mostly
 house fires.The worst fire they have  
 attended was the one at Baston House, 
 Fen Road.The Fire station has one fire
 engine called the watertender.The     
 uniform that they have to wear is big 
 and bulky and hot, especially in the  
 summer. The trousers and boots melt   
 in any fire if they are in there too  
 long.Most of the firemen like their   
 job as a firemen because they find it 
 an interesting and rewarding job.The  
 firemen meet once a week to check the 
 equipment and to have a fire practice.
 The Fire Station is centrally situated
 near the Police Station,Health Centre 
 and Library.
