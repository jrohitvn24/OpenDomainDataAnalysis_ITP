		<content>The study area contains two buildings  
ofparticular interest-                 
DEENE HALL has been developed over six 
centuries..from a quadrangular-plan    
mediaeval manor into a Tudor &amp; Georgian
mansion.The Hall faces south across    
gardens and a man-made lake, and has   
been owned by the Brudenell Family     
since 1514 when it was acquired by Sir 
Robert Brudenell.(The house and park   
are open to the public at weekends in  
the summer months)                     
KIRBY HALL dates from 1570,and stands  
in a secluded hollow,and although      
looking habitable from the Gretton to  
Deene road,it is a partially restored  
Elizabethan house,with much of the     
structure derelict...but the building  
still presents many interesting        
architectural features..strongly       
influenced by Italian Renaissance      
designs.(The Hall is open daily)       </content>
