		<content> LITTLE OAKLEY is a very small village.
 There are three farms,two are central.
 Also there is a wood called Sart Wood,
 it is dominated by deciduous trees,   
 which lose their leaves in winter like
 the oak,ash,beech and hawthorn.       
      A brook passes by LITTLE OAKLEY, 
 it is called Harpers Brook.           
      St. Peters Church is on the      
 border of LITTLE OAKLEY.It is the     
 property of the Orton Trust,an        
 organisation that preserves           
 architecture.                         
      Outside there is a sign saying   
 "This building is maintained as a     
 craft centre by the Orton Trust that  
 restores Architecture."               
      There are only a few amenities in
  LITTLE OAKLEY,a bus stop and the     
 Church.A large amount of the buildings
 are cottages.Most of the land cover is
 sown pasture and farmland.            </content>
