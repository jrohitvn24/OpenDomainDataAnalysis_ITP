		<title>06Sandringham Kennels</title>
		<content> The kennels were built by King Edward 
 VI in 1897. Originally designed to    
 house 100 dogs, the old kennels were  
 demolished and redesigned in 1968 to  
 accomodate 40 dogs. Today there are   
 about 20 dogs including 5 Labradors   
 belonging to The Queen. Labradors and 
 Spaniels are bred to provide working  
 dogs for the estate's gamekeepers.    
 The dogs can often be seen as they are
 exercised as a pack in the Park.      
                                       
 The Queen names the new puppies born  
 at the kennels and they are registered
 at the Kennel Club. The Queen's great 
 interest in the dogs has led to the   
 breeding of four Field Trial          
 Champions.(Sandringham Ranger,        
 Sandringham Slipper, Sherry of        
 Biteabout and Sandringham Sydney.)    
 Recently, The 'Dorgi' has been bred, a
 cross between Dachshund and a Corgi.  </content>
