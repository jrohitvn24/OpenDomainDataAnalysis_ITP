		<content> Generally, hedges reinforced with wire
 fencing bound the fields. In the      
 Farlam and Tarn area dry stone walling
 is also used. Many of the hedges are  
 layed or trimmed regularly and well   
 maintained. Very few have been taken  
 out, and by modern standards the      
 fields are small.                     
 The farms are family concerns         
 employing very few other people.      
 Border Collie dogs are used to round  
 up sheep.                             
 The farm houses and out-buildings are 
 mostly stone built. The milking       
 parlours, though clean, are not of    
 modern design or equipped with the    
 most modern facilities. All the       
 farmers own at least one tractor and  
 do their own hay-making and           
 harvesting.
