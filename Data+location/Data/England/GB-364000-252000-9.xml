		<title>09BROMYARD FOLK FESTIVAL</title>
		<content>    The first annual{Folk Festival     
 started in{1968,}as a{Ceilidh}in a    
 shed.                                 
    The Festival became popular with   
 campers. The attendance figures are   
 usually about{2000.}It became so      
 popular it was thought it would have  
 to end due to lack of space. A local  
 farmer offered the use of his field,  
 called{Broad Bridge.                  
    The{Folk music}and{Morris Dancing  
 dates back further than 1968. Every   
 year Morris and Folk dancers come from
 all over Britain, during the first    
 week in{September.}Bromyard is a very 
 important venue for national Folk and 
 Morris dancers.                       
    The local Morris side,{Faithful    
{City,}helps to organise and present   
 this festival. Exhibition dancing is  
 performed in the local hospital and   
 Old People's Home.                    </content>
