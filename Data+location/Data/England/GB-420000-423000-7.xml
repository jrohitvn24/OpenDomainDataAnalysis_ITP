		<title>07THE OLD HALL, HECKMONDWIKE</title>
		<content>{PUBLIC HOUSE:                         
 Although  born at Fieldhead, Birstall,
 on 13th March, 1733, Joseph Priestley,
 philosopher, scientist, and discoverer
 of oxygen,  spent his  childhood years
 (from  1742 to  1752) living  with his
 aunt  Sarah  Keighley at  Heckmondwike
 Old Hall. He  attended  Batley Grammar
 School learning Latin and Greek. Today
 the  Old  Hall  is  converted  into  a
 distinctive   public   house.   It was
 restored  by  Malcolm  Lister  in 1982
 into  the  finest  example  of a  half
 timbered   building  in  England.  The
 present   entrance  hall  was  once  a
 priest's  confessional.  The  main bar
 retains its  original ceiling and many
 of the oak  beams  date  back to 1740.
 Which is the most  vivid  memory of my
 visit? - the licensee  playing "Love's
 Cigarette" - a  1920's   tune  on  the
 pianola.    {          FRANCIS GILLARD</content>
