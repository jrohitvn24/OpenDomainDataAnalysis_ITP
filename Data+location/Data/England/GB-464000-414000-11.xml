		<title>11SYKEHOUSE LOCK</title>
		<content> WE DROVE TO SEE MR HACKNER THE KEEPER 
 OF SYKEHOUSE LOCK. WE ASKED MR HACKNER
 A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LOCK AND THE
 CANAL. WE ASKED HIM HOW  MANY BOATS   
 COME PAST IN A DAY. HE SAID IT DEPENDS
 WHICH DAY. ON WEEKENDS WE GET ABOUT   
 FORTY PLEASURE CRUISERS OR ON WEEKDAYS
 TANKERS COMING FROM GOOLE CARRYING    
 HUNDREDS OF TONS OF STEEL. THE ACTUAL 
 SIZE OF THE LOCK IS 25 METRES LONG AND
 ABOUT 4 METRES DEEP. THE CANAL IS     
 ABOUT 4 METRES DEEP AND 40 MILES LONG.
 THE CANAL IS CALLED THE NEW JUNCTION  
 CANAL BECAUSE IT LINKS UP TWO MORE    
 CANALS. THESE ARE THE SHEFFIELD AND   
 SOUTH YORKSHIRE NAVIGATION CANAL AND  
 THE OTHER IS CALLED THE AIRE AND      
 CALDER. MR HACKNER SAID THE ORIGINAL  
 CANAL WAS BUILT IN 1900 AND THE LOCK  
 WAS MODERNISED IN 1981. WE TOOK A FEW 
 PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE LOCK AND MR HACKNER
 AND THEN THANKED HIM AND SAID GOODBYE.</content>
