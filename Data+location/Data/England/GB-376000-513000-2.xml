		<title>02BROUGH HILL HORSE FAIR</title>
		<content> BROUGH AND ALL THE ROADS AROUND USED  
 TO BE ALMOST FULL WHEN THE FAIR WAS AT
 BROUGH. THE LOCAL FARMERS BROUGHT ALL 
 THEIR SPARE PONIES DOWN FROM THE FELL 
 AND PUT THEM IN PENS AT THE SIDE OF   
 THE ROAD TO BE SOLD AT THE FAIR.      
                                       
 THERE WERE LOTS OF PONIES AND CARTS.  
 PEOPLE WOULD BE GOING INTO THE SHOPS  
 AND HOTELS AND BUYING MANY THINGS     
 PEOPLE WOULD BE PUSHING AND SHOVING   
 AND THERE WOULD BE GYPSY CHILDREN     
 PLAYING. NO ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ABLE  
 TO MOVE.{                             
                                       
 ON 1ST OF OCTOBER  1880 THE SCHOOL    
 HAD 3 DAYS HOLIDAY FOR THE FAIR. IN   
 1908 THE HOLIDAY WAS REDUCED TO 2     
 DAYS. IN 1946 TO ONE DAY. IN 1964 THE 
 HOLIDAY WAS STOPPED BECAUSE THE FAIR  
 WAS NOT SO LARGE. APPLEBY FAIR HAD    
 TAKEN OVER.                           </content>
