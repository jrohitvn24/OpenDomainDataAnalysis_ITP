		<title>08OUR WALK ACROSS THE HEATH.</title>
		<content> Our group walked along the public     
 footpaths across Orsett Heath.We      
 entered some fields that belonged to  
 Mr.Hew Watt a local farmer.The        
 footpath led into some corn           
 fields,having got out of these fields 
 we came into a pea field.Some of us   
 picked the pods and ate the peas      
 inside them.Having walked across quite
 a few more corn and pea fields,we came
 to a stile.Having climbed over the    
 stile,we found ourselves by the edge  
 of the A13.The group rested for a     
 while before starting our way back.We 
 walked back through some woods and    
 soon arrived back at school.When we   
 got back to the classroom,we sorted   
 out our pea pods and heads of corn and
 did some follow up work.
