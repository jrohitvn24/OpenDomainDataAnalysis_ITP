		<content>  The oldest place of interest is the  
 remains of{Cainhoe Castle.}There is   
 little to be seen but the earth works 
 of a{Saxon Fort.}Probably there was   
 just a wooden structure with a{motte  
 and{bailey.                           
  We have a ruined{12c Church.}It was  
 used for special services until the   
 1950s but after the roof lead was     
 stolen it fell into disrepair. It has 
 now been made into a{picnic area.     
  The proposed{Greensand Ridge Walk    
 will pass through our area. This is a 
{long distance footpath}between{Sandy}&amp;
{Leighton Buzzard.}There is a small    
{campsite}with minimum facilities at   
 Kiln Farm on the route.               
 There are{5 Public Houses}which all   
 provide food. One has an old{Lock-up &amp;
{Pound}in the grounds.                 
  In the late summer several{gardens   
 are open to the public for{charity.   </content>
