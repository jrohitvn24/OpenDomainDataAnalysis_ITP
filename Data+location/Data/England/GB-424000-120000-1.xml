		<title>01The countryside of our area</title>
		<content> Our Domesday project area lies to the 
 north and east of Landford village,in 
 the extreme south of the county of    
 Wiltshire.It is mostly fields and     
 woodland.There are hardly any         
 factories and it is very peaceful.    
 There are a few sawmills and a few    
 planted evergreens.Sometimes if you   
 walk down a road you will have planted
 evergreens on one side and deciduous  
 mixed trees on the other side.It is   
 rolling countryside,mainly used for   
 dairy farming and the growing of grass
 for silage and hay.There are several  
 poultry farms supplying chickens for  
 sale in shops and supermarkets.{      
 There are no shops or post offices in 
 the block, just groups of houses      
 lining the lanes at Landford Wood and 
 Plaitford and otherwise scattered     
 cottages and farmhouses.Some timber-  
 framed houses are over 400 years old. </content>
