		<content> Chorlton Green, which was once the    
 centre of the original village, is a  
 conservation area dating from 1970,   
 being designated under the Civic      
 Amenities Act of 1967. South of the   
 Green is St. Clement's churchyard,    
 containing the site of the first      
 parish church dating from the early   
 16th century. It was replaced by the  
 second church in 1780, and closed in  
 1940. The bell tower was donated as a 
 Jubilee gift in 1888 and is now Grade 
 2 listed. Two houses on the west side 
 of the Green were once farmhouses and 
 are also Grade 2 listed.
