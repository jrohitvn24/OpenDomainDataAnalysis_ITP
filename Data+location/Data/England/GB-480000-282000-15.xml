		<title>15A Day in My Life</title>
		<content> This is a usual Saturday in May for   
 me.                                   
 I usually get up at 8.30. I would get 
 up later but I have football, it      
 starts at 9.30 and finishes at 10.30. 
 When I get back I watch t.v.          
 At 11.30 I go for my music lesson. I  
 arrive home at 1.00. I can then do    
 what I want in the afternoon.         
 Normally, I go out with my friends    
 after dinner. There is not a great    
 deal that we can do but we usually    
 manage to amuse ourselves somehow.    
 In the evening I watch t.v. There     
 are mainly comedy programmes, quiz    
 programmes and light entertainment on 
 a typical Saturday. At 10.00 Match of 
 the Day is on. This is a football     
 programme showing the best of the     
 day's matches. This finishes at       
 11.00. Lots of people watch this. I   
 get to bed at 11.30.                  </content>
