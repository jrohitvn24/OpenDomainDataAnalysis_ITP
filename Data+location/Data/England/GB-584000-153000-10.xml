		<title>10THE SCHOOL IN THE PAST</title>
		<content>     Rebecca Fagg, a current pupil.    
     When grandma went to school the   
 children stayed there until they      
 left. Now at the age of eleven they   
 transfer to the secondary school in   
 Lenham. The girls used to go to       
 Harrietsham School on the train for   
 cookery lessons one day a week while  
 the boys did gardening on the opposite
 side of the road where Troys Mead     
 council houses now stand.             
     There was no school field as this 
 was still Church Meadow and the       
 playground was divided into a boys and
 girls area seperated by a wall. The   
 toilets were outside and are now used 
 as storage sheds.                     
     The headmaster lived in the school
 house, now the school offices,and the 
 infant teacher in the school flat     
 which is not used at present but it is
 hoped to turn this into a museum.     </content>
