		<content> Elland is entered in the original     
 Domesday book under Ealand (Anglo-    
 Saxon'ea'water and'land'dwelling).    
 R.Calder was shallow here and a plaque
 by the bridge tells of the murder of  
 males of the Eland family in the Eland
 Feud.Above the river stands the Parish
 Church of St Mary the Virgin.The first
 church was built in 1180.Elland Bridge
 was the site of a ducking stool and a 
 series of wooden bridges were built   
 and rebuilt as early as 1199.The first
 stone bridge of 1579 had poor         
 foundations and had to rebuilt in 1584
 This in turn was swept away in 1615.  
 It took 2 years to complete a new one.
 "Yorkshire mixtures" were begun in the
 church in Northgate. The first sweet  
 making firm of J. Dobson &amp; Sons       
 situated there.Trays of sweets spilled
 by accident were liked by Thomas      
 Dobson, hence their name.             </content>
