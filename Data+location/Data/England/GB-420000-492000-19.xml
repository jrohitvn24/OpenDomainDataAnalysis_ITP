		<content> Mill House is a historic farmhouse.It 
 has bed and breakfast accommodation.It
 is open from Easter until October,but 
 sometimes Mrs. Knox(the owner) doesn't
 open it all the time.The charges vary 
 according to the guests.There are two 
 double bedrooms.It is difficult to say
 how many guests stay per year.Most    
 people come again and again.These are 
 mostly friends.Couples enjoy the peace
 as no children under ten are taken.   
 As Hornby is in the "Herriott Country"
 many tourists drive through the area  
 or walk the rural footpaths.          
 St.Mary's Church also attracts        
 visitors as it has a unique Norman    
 carved archway.
