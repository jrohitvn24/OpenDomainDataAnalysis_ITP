		<title>15WASH COTTAGES,DEBDEN</title>
		<content>    Wash Cottages are{thatched cottages
 with white walls.They have small front
 gardens and quite big back gardens.   
 Originally Wash Cottages were all one 
 building used for the{work house}but  
 during the 19th.century they were     
 split into four homes.Now there are   
 only three cottages because two of    
 them have been joined together.       
    The name Wash Cottages comes from  
 the stream,or "wash",which used to run
 near the cottages.                    
    In the living room of number 55    
 there is a large{fireplace}which is   
 mainly composed of the original{hand  
{made}bricks.There are two hooks up the
 chimney.                              
    The cottages were last rethatched  
 in about 1970.The walls are{lathe and 
{plaster}with some dung.When we looked 
 up the chimney we could see the{dung  
 stuck on the sides.                   </content>
