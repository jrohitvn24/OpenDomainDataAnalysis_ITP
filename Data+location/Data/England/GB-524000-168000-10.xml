		<title>10LIVING IN WIMBLEDON</title>
		<content>     Wimbledon is a very nice town.It  
 even has a very important tennis      
 court.People from all over the world  
 come to play against people from      
 England.If it is raining the          
 professionals and the beinners can go 
 to the tennis club next to our        
 school.Our school is called Garfield  
 school and we have a park beside our  
 school.It is called Garfield park.On  
 the corner of Haydons Rd.,there is a  
 small post office.On Wimbledon Common 
 people take horses up there to        
 ride.And some people like to take     
 their dogs for walks up there.People  
 also go to feed the ducks that live   
 there.For the local transport we use  
 buses,trains and tubes.Most people use
 the tube.
