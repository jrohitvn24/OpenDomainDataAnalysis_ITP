		<content> Most of the firms in the Newton Abbot 
 area are small firms. There are one or
 two large firms that employ quite a   
 few people, e.g.Centrax and W.B.B. who
 quarry pipe clay. The local authority 
 Teignbridge Council are trying to     
 encourage small firms to set up in the
 area by setting aside land for small  
 industrial estates, such as at{Decoy  
{and{Brunel Road.}                     
  The{A.R.C. (Amalgamated Roadstones   
{Corporation)}has a 75 acre quarry     
 which extracts 800 tons of sand and   
 gravel a day. They expect reserves to 
 last at least 10 years. The sand and  
 gravel is dug up, put on a conveyor   
 belt, cleaned by water and sorted into
 different grades of sand and gravel. {
{A.R.C.}have interests all over the    
 world, including gold mines. There are
 many dangers at the quarry on average 
 there is only one accident a year.    </content>
