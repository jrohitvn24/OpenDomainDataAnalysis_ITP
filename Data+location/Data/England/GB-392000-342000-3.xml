original Domesday book and was placed  
in the Totmonslow Hundred              
      The first Caverswall Castle was  
built in 1222 in the reign of Edward II
by William de Caerswall.Sir William was
Sheriff of the County of Staffordshire 
from 1260 to 1268 and died in 1292 .His
son Richard was the first member of    
Parliament for the County.The Castle   
remained in the de Caerswall family    
until 1398 when it passed into the     
hands of the Montgomeries.In the early 
17th century the castle was rebuilt by 
Matthew Cradock a merchant turned      
country gentleman.He restored and      
adapted much of the medieval work.In   
1643 during the war between King       
Charles and his Parliament,the Castle  
became a stronghold and garrison for   
the Parliamentary Army.
