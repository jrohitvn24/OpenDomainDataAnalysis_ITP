		<title>08Leighfields Farming Changes</title>
		<content> Prior to the 1938-45 war Leighfield   
 was primarily a grazing area with 119 
 enclosures. The fields were adequately
 supplied with water from springs and  
 the grass keep was in many cases let  
 out. The Ministry of Agriculture      
 ploughed the land for the war effort  
 and the area became arable which it   
 has since remained. A few hedgerows   
 were removed in the mid 1950's but    
 many more have been removed since 1970
 so that the area now comprises only 53
 enclosures.                           
 The character of the area has         
 therefore changed dramatically in     
 recent years and local opinion is that
 as the area was unique in             
 Leicestershire it was a pity that part
 of it at least wasn't preserved       
 unaltered.
