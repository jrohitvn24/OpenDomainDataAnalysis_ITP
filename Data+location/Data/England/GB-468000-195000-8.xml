		<content>There are no public forms of           
entertainment.  Pyrton and Lewknor     
both     have village halls. Pyrton's  
used to   be the old school and        
Lewknor's is   actually part of the    
school. Jumble   sales, Christmas      
bazaars,fetes, shrub   sales, private  
parties and disco's,   council  and    
other meetings are all   held in these 
halls. The school puts   on two plays  
and concerts a year which   the        
community are invited to. The 'Lewknor 
Singers'also put on concerts.          
Television is probably the most popular
form of entertainment.(some have       
video's). We have a committee which    
looks after the playingfield. Cricket  
and football matches are played.       
CLUBS-Mothers and toddlers,keep-fit,   
monthly Friday club (general interest),
ladies netball, self-help crafts,      
youth,and occasional bingo/whist drive.</content>
