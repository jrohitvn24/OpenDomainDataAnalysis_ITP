		<content>   In the village there are no clubs   
 for children to join apart from the   
 Brownie pack.The children make there  
 own amusement and sometimes go outside
 the village to participate in swimming
 at the Ongar Sports Centre.The 3      
 favourite pasttimes of the children   
 are horse riding,fishing and riding   
 BMX bikes.Some children have their own
 ponies or horses and others hire them 
 from riding stables or friends.Most of
 the children fish in the river roding 
 and catch Perch,Dace,Roach,Chubb,Pike 
 and minows.BMX bikes are very popular 
 and the children build ramps and      
 practise different tricks on their    
 bikes.Some of the children enjoy      
 roller skating and jogging.Most of the
 children are fond of pets and keep a  
 variety of dogs,cats,gerbils,rabbits, 
 fish,guinea pigs and birds
