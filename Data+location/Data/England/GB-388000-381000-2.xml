		<title>02Woodford Rose Queen Gala</title>
		<content> Woodford Rose Queen Gala is held once 
 a year,in June.It is run voluntarily  
 and the people  who volunteer hold the
 office for two years and then the job 
 is taken by someone else.             
 It all starts earlier in the year when
 leaflets are sent all around Woodford 
 and part of Bramhall.The leaflet      
 enables you to say whether you want   
 your child to take part and what you  
 would like them to do e.g.be The      
 Bride,The Rosebud Queen,The Rose Queen
 or be in the fancy dress parade.Girls 
 have to be over 12 to be The Rose     
 Queen and under 8 to be The Bride or  
 The Rosebud Queen.Children under 3    
 cannot take part.The names of those   
 girls who wish to take part are put   
 into a hat and then drawn out.The     
 Queens both have a retinue of petal   
 throwers and The Bride has a retinue  
 set out like a proper village wedding.</content>
