		<content> The one thing that makes Camber a     
 popular place is the long sandy beach 
 and safe bathing.  It is a wonderful  
 place for all types of sea sport,     
 swimmimg, water skiing, sail boards,  
 sand yachting and for walking along   
 the seashore.  The sea, the shore and 
 the constantly changing colours       
 enliven and invigorate visitor and    
 villager alike.  Children love to play
 among the sand dunes, the beach is a  
 place where dogs may run free and     
 enjoy life. Many people bring their   
 horses for exercise and training when 
 inland sites are not usable in bad    
 weather, and even in mid_winter       
 children will be on the beach with    
 their parents building sand castles,  
 playing football, cricket or rounders.
