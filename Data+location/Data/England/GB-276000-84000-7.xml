		<content>   There are no schools or colleges in 
 the area of Ref.02760084.Primary      
 school children are taken by bus to   
 Moretonhampstead and the journey can  
 take as long as an hour and forty_five
 minutes.This is not because of the dis
 tance from Moreton but because the bus
 takes a devious route in order to pick
 up the children from the isolated farm
 houses.Secondary school children are  
 also taken by bus to the comprehensive
 school in Ashburton.Just one child    
 from Doccombe is taken by private hire
 car to Moreton Primary school.Some of 
 the farmsteads are no longer farm_    
 houses but the homes of wealthy people
 who pay for their children to go to   
 private boarding schools.             
   Adults in search of further educat  
 ion must take themselves by car to eve
 ning classes in a nearby town.
