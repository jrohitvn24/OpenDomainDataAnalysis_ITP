		<title>11UPPER RATLAKE FARM,AMPFIELD</title>
		<content>    Upper Ratlake farm, as the name    
 implies is in North Ratlake between   
 the villages of Ampfield and Hursley. 
{Cattle farming}is carried out there.  
 The farm is owned by Mr. Cooper but he
 is away in Monaco.Mr. Hillier rents   
 the farm and buildings. Altogether    
 there are 161 acres and includes barns
 and a farmhouse which is quite large  
 and was built in 1957.                
    There are no crops at all on the   
 farm but{beef cattle}are bred to be   
 fattened and then sold for meat.Mr.   
 Hillier's day starts at 6.00am. and   
 ends at approximately 9.00pm.         
 depending on the time of year.        
    It is mainly grassland for the cows
 to eat, and from the{farmhouse}the    
 area appears fairly flat with few     
 trees and hedges.
