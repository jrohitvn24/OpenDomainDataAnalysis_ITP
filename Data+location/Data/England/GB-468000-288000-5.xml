		<title>05THE VICAR OF FOXTON</title>
		<content> Rev.David King is the vicar of the    
 parish which includes Foxton Gartree  
 and Gumley.                           
 He came to St. Andrew's Church in     
 November 1983.The most important part 
 of his work he says is visiting the   
 people to make friends and help in any
 way he can.He also writes lots of     
 letters during his day.               
 He preaches at each village church on 
 Sunday.                               
 St. Andrew's_8a.m.,10a.m.,and 6p.m.   
 St. Helen's_1130a.m.,4.45p.m.         
 There is also a chapel in Gartree     
 prison for the inmates and staff.The  
 vicar is Rev.Pratt.                   
 Both vicars dislike the fact that only
 a few of the parishoners regularly    
 attend the services.
