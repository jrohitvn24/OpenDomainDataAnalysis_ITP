		<content>Pen Ponds are artificial and were made 
from a stream which flowed through the 
Park. The Ranger was allowed to dig    
and sell gravel in the seventeenth     
century. There is a bird sanctuary at  
the Upper Pond where mallard, tufted   
duck, coot, moorhen, grebe and swans   
can be seen. Pike and roach live in    
the ponds. Beverley Brook flows north- 
wards through the Park towards the     
River Thames, with willow trees on     
either bank.                           
Many aircraft fly over on their flight-
path to London Heathrow Airport.       
The Park is used by golfers, walkers,  
horse riders, joggers, dog- walkers,   
cyclists (there is a cycle path),      
model aircraft enthusiasts, kite       
flyers, bird watchers, polo-players,   
rugby players, fishermen with permits  
and picnickers.
