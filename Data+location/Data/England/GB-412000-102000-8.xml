  The foxes survive in the area because
 of the smaller rodents(for            
 example,mice,rats and                 
 squirrels),rabbits and young or       
 injured deer.All these are prey to the
 foxes.The foxes' dens are left alone  
 and are away from the test areas used 
 by the Ministry of Defence.           
  The deer,especially the roe deer,also
 are seen in this area.They watch the  
 men working at the Ministry of Defence
 but as soon as the deer realise that  
 they are being watched,they run away. 
  The rabbits have dominated much of   
 the area even though they are the prey
 of the foxes.As with the deer,they    
 only eat grasses and vegetation.
