		<title>02Attitudes in Mayfield</title>
		<content> Our survey of 27th June showed the    
 major issues are (1)New shops_4 built 
 &amp; opened in 1985. (2)Traffic.         
 (3)Amenities.Our survey showed that   
 the new shops are popular especially  
 the Bakery,but many villagers feel    
 Mayfield needs even more shops of a   
 greater variety &amp; price range (shops  
 here are expensive).                  
 The major problem in Mayfield is      
 traffic particularly the amount of    
 large vehicles which block our narrow 
 High Street.Almost all are in favour  
 of a By_pass.Parking is also a        
 problem;some feel there should be more
 yellow lines while others say they    
 discourage trade.                     
 Everyone feels there should be more   
 evening activities for the young      
 because there is no railway &amp; the bus 
 service stops at 7pm &amp; doesn't run on 
 Sundays.                              </content>
