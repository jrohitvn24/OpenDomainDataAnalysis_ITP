		<content> On our walk we saw three families of  
 ducks, they were{mallards.}Two of them
 started to fight. One got on the      
 others back and bit the others neck   
 and pushed the other right under the  
 water. All the families had ducklings 
 with them. On the reservoir we saw a  
{coots nest}anchored by the reeds, the 
 mother bird was in the reservoir      
 looking for food. Above us we saw a   
{lapwing}flying across the sky. Walking
 along we came across a ranger from    
{Thrybergh Country Park.}He told us    
 that they were making Firsby reservoir
 into a Country Park. He said he would 
 come and talk to us at school about   
 it.                                   
 There is evidence also that{badgers   
 live in the area between Firsby and   
 Ravenfield Ponds and an{avocet}has    
 been seen.
