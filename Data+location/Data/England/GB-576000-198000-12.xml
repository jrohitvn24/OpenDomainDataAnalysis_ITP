		<content> The following extracts are taken from 
 tape recorded interviews at Eastham   
 Old Folks Home: I was top at writing  
 when I was at school. When I left     
 school I remember going camping with  
 the girl guides as I was patrol       
 leader. I enjoyed my schooldays. When 
 I left school to go to work I worked  
 in Canning Town making books. My two  
 sisters and I worked there. The people
 who owned it were Germans. I had some 
 relations who were well off but I had 
 to work hard. The world has changed   
 and I am not proud of all the violence
 there is now. I would be nervous to go
 our now. I used to like going to the  
 zoo. I was an animal lover. My son got
 killed in the army.He was in Australia
 doing his National Service when a gun 
 blew up. I like watching television.  
 Lively programmes are my favourite.   
 Tea and Babycham favourite drinks.    </content>
