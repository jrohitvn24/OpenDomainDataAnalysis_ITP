		<title>04A WEEKEND IN WITTON GILBERT</title>
		<content> SATURDAYS   I get up about 8:30am.    
 Evey fortnight I play in Derwentside  
 string orchestra from 9:30-12:00.     
 Otherwise I either shop in Durham  or 
 read and listen to records.           
   In the afternoons I do homework,    
 read, listen to records , watch telly 
 or maybe play badminton or tennis in  
 the garden. Often my Gran or Auntie   
 comes for tea. I go to bed at about   
 10-10:30pm.                           
 SUNDAYS   I rise about 9.00am. We go  
 to church for 10:00am. Usually someone
 comes back for coffee after mass,often
 a student priest who is training with 
 my Dad (the Vicar). After dinner I do 
 left over homework. Each fortnight Dad
 does a service for the mentally       
 handicapped or he might do some       
 gardening. We usually get visitors    
 again. I do much the same as on       
 Saturdays.I go to bed at about 10pm.  </content>
